   A federal jury decided Friday that a
businessman wasn't lying when he said Reagan-Bush campaign
officials asked Iranians not to free American hostages until after
the 1980 presidential election.
   The jury acquitted Richard J. Brenneke of five counts of false
declaration to a federal judge in Denver when he made statements
describing an alleged 1980 meeting in Paris at which he said the
request about the hostages was made.
   One of the counts involved Brenneke's general description of the
meeting. He also was found innocent of making false declarations
when he said the meeting was attended by the late CIA director
William Casey and by Donald Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to South
Korea, and that he and fellow businessman Heinrich Rupp both worked
for the CIA.
   Brenneke was not charged in connection with his statement to the
judge that Rupp flew George Bush to Paris in 1980. Brenneke
testified Thursday that Bush, who was elected vice president later
that year, was not at the meeting he attended and he did not see
him in Paris.
   The unanimous verdict was announced at 5:10 p.m. after five
hours of deliberation. Brenneke was embraced by his attorney,
Michael Scott, and the two men clasped hands.
   Outside the courtroom, a smiling Brenneke said, ``We told the
truth, we told the truth all along and, by God, it was believed.''
   Brenneke was indicted on the false declaration charges after he
appeared in 1988 as a character witness for Rupp, who was being
sentenced for bank fraud in Denver.
   In his statements to the judge, Brenneke portrayed Rupp as a
friend with whom he worked in Southeast Asia for the CIA
proprietary, Air America. He told the judge that he and Rupp had
helped arrange the clandestine Paris trip.
   Brenneke said there were three meetings about the hostages on
Oct. 19 and 20 at the Hotel Florida and Hotel Crillion in Paris.
Brenneke told the Denver judge he attended one meeting at the Hotel
Florida.
   Under federal law, false declaration to a judge is a stronger
charge than perjury, which can involve lies to either a judge or
jury.
   The trial was originally to have been held in Denver but was
moved to Portland, near Brenneke's home in West Linn, after he had
open heart surgery.
   In his closing arguments Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas
M. O'Rourke dismissed as a fabrication Brenneke's description of
the secret meeting and its purpose: to sabotage President Carter's
re-election campaign by delaying the hostage release.
   O'Rourke also said Brenneke had lied when he said he worked for
the CIA, and when he said those present at the Paris meeting
included Casey, who was Reagan's campaign manager, and Gregg, who
was also a CIA official assigned to President Carter's National
Security Council staff.
   Iran released the hostages it seized on Nov. 4, 1979, on the day
Bush and Reagan were sworn into office, Jan. 20, 1981.
   Brenneke's defense had been built around the contention that the
government would lie to cover its tracks in covert operations and
that Brenneke worked for the CIA and the agency wants to keep that
secret.

   Pope John Paul II is making another trip to
Latin America, where the Roman Catholic church has changed
dramatically in the 11 years since he first outlined his vision of
its role.
   The nine-day visit to Mexico, starting Sunday, will underline
the changes since 1979, when John Paul set the tone of his papacy
toward church activism in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic region.
   Maintain your commitment to the poor, the pope told his bishops
in Puebla, Mexico, but do not become partisan politicians.
   In the ensuing years, the church has assumed a greater role in
social and economic affairs and gained broader prestige in Latin
America, but divisions have emerged between liberal and
conservative clergy.
   From without, the church is increasingly threatened by the
aggressive proselytizing of evangelical Protestant churches.
   It is challenged by the dramatic growth of poverty in a region
of vital concern to the Vatican. This is John Paul's 10th trip to
Latin America and he also plans to visit Cuba, perhaps in December.
   Latin Americans make up nearly half the world's 850 million
Catholics. The Latin church has influenced Catholicism worldwide
with its bold efforts to adapt the gospel to Third World societies.
   Liberation theology, which links spiritual freedom to liberation
from economic and social oppression, was born in Latin Ameria. John
Paul has sought to blunt the philosophy's effect.
   ``Certainly, what I feel in the last few years is what we feel a
little in the universal church; it is a moment of what some call
conservatism,'' said the Rev. Irineu Wilges, a Brazilian who is the
Franciscan order's counselor for Latin America.
   Despite that conservatism, the Latin American church leadership
has transformed itself.
   Cardinals and bishops, once close to the ruling minority, began
condemning political repression in the 1970s, when brutal
dictatorships were common. Frequently, the church was the only
institution strong enough to stand up to the government.
   Catholic officials who specialize in Latin America say the
church leadership has extended its political role in three ways:
   _ Encouraging the establishment of democracy, particularly in
Brazil and Chile.
   _ Serving as a mediator between the government and guerrillas,
as in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
   _ Speaking out on problems facing new, fragile democracies, such
as land reform, foreign debt and the rights of native Indians.
   Those actions reflect the church's widespread credibility in
Latin America and its effort to grow closer to the poor.
   ``The people have much more faith in the church than they did 10
years ago,'' said the Rev. Jose Luis Castaneda, a Peruvian who is
the Jesuit order's regional assistant for South America. ``I don't
know if it's the merit of the church or the disasters of the
politicians.''
   John Paul has supported the Latin church's ``option for the
poor,'' declared at a 1968 conference of bishops in Medellin,
Colombia.
   On trips to the region, the pope has assailed dictatorship,
highlighted the foreign debt problem and defended labor unions. He
also has condemned liberation theology that uses Marxist analysis
and warned clerics to stay out of politics.
   Action has accompanied his words, particuarly in Brazil, whose
bishops have encouraged liberation theology. Brazil has about
100,000 ``ecclesiastical base communities,'' church-sponsored
groups that press for political and social change.
   The Vatican promoted conservatives in Brazil, which has moved
the bishops conference to a more centrist position.
   In 1985 it ordered the Rev. Leonardo Boff, Brazil's most
prominent progressive theologian, to maintain ``obedient silence''
for a year.
   Last year, the Vatican divided the Paolo archdiocese of another
progressive, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, into five smaller
dioceses, seriously diminishing his influence.
   ``It isn't that some people are for helping the poor and some
are against,'' Wilges said. ``The church is divided over how to do
it.''
   Divisions between liberals and progressives have deepened
because of the actions in Brazil and similar ones in other
countries.
   Last year, the Vatican ignored the choice of the organization's
own leadership in choosing a new secretary-general of the Latin
American Confederation of Religious, prompting an outcry from
priests and nuns.
   Religious orders account for about 80 percent of the priests and
nuns in Latin America. Their members tend to be more liberal than
diocesan clergy and bishops.
   The Vatican acted after the confederation introduced a
Bible-study program for members that the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith condemned as too ``ideological.''
   Whatever the internal problems, many church officials say Latin
American Catholicism's greatest challenge is from conservative
evangelical churches on the outside.
   Non-Catholics in the region now number more than 30 million, the
Latin American bishops conference says.
   In Mexico, the number of Protestants grew more than 500 percent
in 1950-1980, to 2.2 million, according to church figures. In some
Mexican states, up to 20 percent of the people are believed to be
non-Catholic.
   Some Catholic officials contend the church's approach to faith
has been too political or intellectual. Others claim the
evangelical churches receive money from the U.S. government or
businesses hoping to hinder church efforts for social change.
   Officials say greater poverty and ever-growing urban slums
create serious problems for the church in spreading its message.
Activism on behalf of the poor continues to exact a price, as shown
by the murder of six Jesuits by Salvadoran soldiers in November.
   ``The standard of living is ... lamentably regressive,'' Bishop
Dario Castrillon Hoyos, president of the bishops conference, said
in a recent report.
   ``We must therefore ask ourselves what have been the results of
the church's effort to raise people's consciences, and of the
political commitment of Catholics.''

   They may prefer shuffleboard to
six-packs and naps to rap, but senior citizens could become the
life of the party in this former college spring break mecca.
   A hotel operator organizing the first ``Senior Spring
Festival,'' which begins Friday, hopes gray-haired sunseekers will
flock each year to this seaside city that is attempting to shake
off its bawdy image.
   ``These aren't what I would call party animals,'' said Philip
Goldfarb, who put together the weekend activities. ``We're trying
to attract an older crowd with events that we think they'll enjoy.''
   The estimated 5,000 seniors will boogie on the beach to the
tunes of The Four Tops and mingle on board a cruise ship. But
there's also an opportunity to pick up some tidbits at seminars on
such sobering topics as finance and health.
   The festivities are scheduled to conclude Sunday with a brunch
for grandparents and their grandchildren.
   ``Don't think of this as something trying to replace the college
kids. It's obviously different,'' said Goldfarb. ``We're not
talking about bikinis and beer. We're showing that there's options
for the elderly to be active and social.''
   Jogging along the beach in a Spandex bodysuit, 65-year-old Ellen
Witt smiled at the idea of her peers in a party mood.
   ``Why should the kids have all the fun? You'd be surprised what
we can think up,'' she said.
   Since a police crackdown drove off college spring breakers in
the mid-1980s, city officials have been preoccupied with trying to
recast Fort Lauderdale as a resort for families and international
tourists.
   But the transformation has been slowed by bureaucracic tangles
and resistance from some business owners.
   A proposal to redesign the seedy beach strip into upscale
boutiques and hotels attracted only one bid from a developer, whose
multimillion-dollar plan was rejected last week as unfeasible.
   A ban on alcohol sale at nude dance clubs was passed by the city
commission, but business at the establishments remains brisk.
   Meanwhile, the central Florida theme parks and attractions
continue to draw tourists from south Florida beaches.
   For 1989, the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau estimated the area received 4.5 million tourists, including
a boost from the January 1989 Super Bowl. But early figures for
this year indicate a drop in tourist spending.
   At the same time, the number of college students visiting this
spring fell below 20,000, down from a record 350,000 in 1985.
   Most of the students have adopted Daytona Beach as the new
spring break capital, but Key West and the Florida Panhandle are
also gaining popularity.
   ``Spring break is part of Fort Lauderdale's past,'' said
Goldfarb. ``We're looking at a different environment.''
   Goldfarb says next year's senior festival _ scheduled to
coincide with a gerontology conference _ will be expanded to a week
and promoted nationally. He predicts up to 10,000 oldsters could
attend.
   And some veterans of the college spring onslaught are wondering
what to expect.
   ``Hey, I'll bring the surfboard and they can bring the beer,''
said Alan Frank, 24, sunning on a seawall with his girlfriend. ``At
least they don't have to worry about IDs.''
   Warren DiPaulo, 17, thought the concept was ``sweet.''
   ``Why not?'' he said. ``Party on, dudes.''

<TEXT>
   After centuries of racial
conflict, South Africa is facing whirlwind change as the government
and its opponents negotiate to end white domination and try to find
a new way to live together.
   But even as the country witnesses scenes unthinkable a year or
two ago, there are enormous divisions and problems to overcome. For
all the rapid political change now under way, much remains the same.
   The government Wednesday began its first formal talks with the
recently legalized African National Congress since the black
nationalist group was formed 78 years ago with the goal of ending
white-minority domination.
   But these talks are only to clear the way for full-scale
negotiations on a new constitution that would share political power
with the country's black majority.
   For South Africans, the meeting created scenes symbolizing the
historic change facing the country.
   President F.W. de Klerk and his Cabinet smiled and chatted with
ANC leaders on the sprawling grounds of an old colonial mansion
that represented centuries of white wealth and privilege.
   Nelson Mandela, released less than three months ago after 27
years in jail, complimented de Klerk on what he was trying to do
for South Africa.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and top security officials
posed for pictures with Walter Sisulu and other ANC leaders
imprisoned for decades.
   Both sides talked of ending injustice and oppression and spoke
of their hopes for a new, democratic nation. Mandela, in a
reference to 350 years of white domination, said the two sides were
finally ending a ``terrible tradition of ... master and servant.''
   The two sides stressed the need for rapid progress and warned
that peace hopes depend on swiftly finding a solution.
   But the government and the ANC face enormous obstacles in
solving the country's divisions. Both sides remain fundamentally
divided on key issues.
   De Klerk says he is committed to ending discrimination, but
major apartheid laws, including measures providing for segregated
neighborhoods and schools, remain in force. The 28 million blacks
have no political rights and the 5 million whites monopolize the
country's wealth.
   De Klerk has repeatedly rejected a simple one-person, one-vote
democratic system. He says this would replace white domination with
black control and there would be no guarantee for white rights.
   Government objectives for a new constitution, according to
senior officials, include some form of white legislative veto
power; a bill of rights and the protection of private property;
guarantees for free enterprise; and some form of white and black
transitional government with white control of the security forces.
   The officials also say that along with English, one of the
official languages should continue to be Afrikaans, the tongue of
the Dutch-descended Afrikaners who account for most of the white
population and control the government.
   The ANC has very different goals. It insists on a full democracy
with no special rights for any ethnic or racial group. It is also
committed to redistributing wealth to aid the millions of
impoverished blacks.
   Many political observers say the country's economic and social
divisions may be harder to solve than its political problems.
   ``Black political leadership is faced with the fact that the
constituency it intends to represent is relatively very poor ...
for them politics has to be about economics and wealth
distribution,'' said Jan Steyn, head of the Urban Foundation, a
private group that focuses on improving black living conditions.
   White leaders are equally insistent on safeguarding private
control of business.
   Their critics say it would take generations to meet even the
most basic needs of the black majority, such as better housing and
education, if the economy is not restructured.
   Leaders on both sides believe the government and the ANC will
find some solution because they have no other choice. Both sides
have staked much of their credibility on securing an agreement and
they are under pressure from black and white extremists who oppose
any power-sharing settlement.
   Government sources, who requested anonymity, say that without an
agreement on a transitional government and a new constitution, the
influence of right-wing whites is likely to grow.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party won 31 percent of the vote
in parliamentary elections for whites last September. White
extremists have called for de Klerk's ouster.
   The ANC faces similar opposition from radical black groups that
talk of armed struggle as the only way to end all white control and
influence. ANC leaders say many young blacks do not want a peaceful
settlement with the government.
   ``One should understand the very serious predicament of the ANC
in regard to the deep suspicion in the minds of millions of young
militant blacks who simply do not believe in the sincerity of the
government,'' said Beyers Naude, a white Afrikaner cleric on the
ANC negotiating team.

<TEXT>
   Outgoing President Oscar Arias said
Central America should be demilitarized because the region's
limited resources should be spent on tractors instead of tanks.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Arias on Wednesday
also criticized what he called U.S. efforts to hinder fulfillment
of a regional peace plan he drafted in 1987 with the help of other
Central American leaders.
   Arias, who hands power Tuesday to Rafael Calderon, was awarded
the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the 1987 peace accord. It
was seen as crucial to ending Nicaragua's civil war and promoting
elections in February in Nicaragua. The U.S.-backed opposition won
the vote.
   ``The decade of the '90s must be the decade of disarmament if we
want greater development,'' said Arias, a Social Democrat whose
country is the only Latin American nation with no armed forces.
   ``There is no other way,'' he said while being driven to a
ceremony at a cattle breeding center outside San Jose. ``The gap
between the rich northern nations and the poor southern ones
continues to widen. Rich countries' commitments to poor countries
are not increasing, so we must depend more on internal savings. We
must dedicate our resources to the satisfaction of our peoples'
needs and not to buying arms.
   ``Costa Rica is the best example. Costa Rica buys tractors while
the rest of Central America buys tanks. The tractors produce food.
The tanks do not.'' He praised the plan of the new Panamanian
government to abolish the army in favor of a civilian-controlled
police force.
   ``I'm pushing that,'' he said.
   Arias said he had planned to teach at Harvard University for a
couple years upon returning to private life but was persuaded by
friends, including former President Jimmy Carter, to continue
promoting peace.
   He said he will dedicate himself to working for the Arias
Foundation for Peace and Human Progress.
   ``There is no greater satisfaction for a human being than being
able to contribute to ending war,'' Arias said.
   ``My experience, my condition as Nobel laureate, as author of
the Central American peace plan will perhaps permit me to help, to
contribute my grain of sand.''
   Of U.S. resistance to his peace plan, Arias said: ``Every time I
spoke with a U.S. functionary it was for that person to tell me
`Look. This isn't working. This is bad. Pull back. Why don't you,
the author, declare that the peace plan is washed up?'
   ``So that they could continue their little Central American
war.''
   He continued: ``The relationship between the war and drug
trafficking did not matter to anyone. Here a horrible cynicism was
put into play. There was a double standard in everything. On one
hand they were saying drugs were the biggest threat to Central
America and that anybody who got involved in drugs must be punished.
   ``But they closed their eyes when those who were helping the
Contras, fomenting war, dealt drugs. And they were on the payroll.''
   Arias provided no hard evidence to support the allegation,
previously made from other quarters, that U.S. officials supporting
the anti-Sandinista rebels dealt in or condoned dealing drugs.
   ``History will take it upon itself to reveal that this was
indeed the case, and that each one receives his just punishment,''
Arias said.
   The president, who met Monday with a delegation of Salvadoran
guerrilla commanders, predicted the civil war in El Salvador will
end this year.
   Asked what he considered his legacy to Central America, Arias
said: ``To have achieved that, for the first time in many many
years, the people of Central America today all live under
democratic systems.
   ``Also, to have appealed to the sensibility of our people to
silence the weapons.''

   Sandra Day O'Connor received the Bess
Wallace Truman Award from the former first lady's daughter, who
praised the Supreme Court justice for her dignity under pressure
and loyalty to family and friends.
   Margaret Truman Daniel said she thought O'Connor and Mrs.
Truman, both Independence natives, were ``tough cookies'' and might
have been friends except from their discrepancy in age and
political leanings.
   O'Connor, 60, the first woman appointed to the nation's highest
court, is a Republican. Mrs. Truman, who died in 1982 at age 97,
was a staunch Democrat like her husband, Harry Truman.
   Mrs. Daniels praised O'Connor for her ``obvious intelligence,
diligence and accomplishment.''
   The award, established earlier this year by an Independence
women's group, will be given each year to a nationally recognized
woman who has chosen a role appropriate to her time and place in
history.
   ``This has been a treasured experience for me,'' O'Connor said.

   Dave Dravecky, who was laid off for
nearly a year with cancer in his pitching arm and broke the same
arm five days after returning to the San Francisco Giants, will
undergo further surgery next week, his publisher says.
   At the height of his career, Dravecky was diagnosed with a
malignant tumor and nearly half of his deltoid muscle was removed
in October 1988.
   He returned on Aug. 10, 1989, leading the Giants to a 4-3 win
over against Cincinnati. But on Aug. 15, pitching against the
Montreal Expos, Dravecky broke his throwing arm. The 34-year-old
retired from baseball last November after a second tumor was
discovered in the arm.
   ``Dave's attitude through all of his ordeals remains
consistent,'' Scott Bolinder, publisher of Zondervan General Trade
Books, said Thursday. ``He is truly an inspiration to overcoming
obstacles and tragedies.''
   Dravecky's surgery Tuesday will be performed at Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in New York. The operation is required to close a wound
from a previous operation on Jan. 4 which has not healed because of
radiation therapy, Bolinder said.
   Dravecky's autobiography, ``Comeback,'' has sold more than
100,000 copies since its release April 1, Bolinder said.

   James P. Hoffa, son of former Teamsters boss
Jimmy Hoffa, won't say if he intends to run in the union's first
direct election next year, but supporters are wearing jackets with
the logo ``Friends of Hoffa.''
   ``I'd vote for him,'' said Mike Bane, chief officer of Teamsters
Local 614 in Pontiac. ``Ninety-five percent of the rank and file''
in Pontiac also would support the candidacy, Bane said.
   Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer, said Wednesday the jackets are
``a reaffirmation of the feelings towards the Hoffa contribution to
the union.'' He refused to say if he would be a candidate when the
1.6-million-member union holds its elections in June 1991.
   The elections are part of a 1989 settlement of a lawsuit in
which the federal government linked dozens of Teamsters executives
to ``a pattern of racketeering,'' including 20 murders.
   Jimmy Hoffa disappeared in 1975 after being released from
federal prison, where he was serving a sentence for mail fraud an
jury tampering. He is presumed to have been killed by the mob.

   Ten years after his death, Communist
Yugoslavia's founder, Josip Broz Tito, faces a second demise: the
almost total negation of his once-vaunted accomplishments.
   ``The Tito myth, which described him as a giant who achieved
only great creations, is now dead in Yugoslavia,'' the state news
agency Tanjug said in a commentary for the anniversary of Tito's
death today.
   Formerly revered, Tito's policies are now denounced. Official
actions are under way throughout the nation to erase the traces of
a personality cult that held sway for almost 40 years.
   Increasingly, Tito is under attack for his authoritarian style
of rule. The ever-fiercer feuds that have pitted Serbs against
non-Serbs, and liberals against orthodox Communists, are
threatening to tear apart the very country Tito built.
   Tito earned international recognition in 1948 for taking
Yugoslavia out of the Soviet orbit and later making it a nonaligned
nation.
   Since Tito's death at age 87 on May 4, 1980, however, Yugoslavs
increasingly have felt that most of their country's current
troubles took root during his 35 years of undisputed rule.
   Tito left Yugoslavia with grave economic and ethnic problems and
an impractical, highly decentralized system of collective
leadership with diluted responsibilities.
   The lack of a strong, central authority _ embodied by Tito
himself during his lifetime _ has now created two systems within
one country, threatening to pull Yugoslavia apart.
   The two most economically developed of Yugoslavia's six
republics, Slovenia and Croatia, have held free elections. Their
next step may be secession.
   The largest republic, Serbia, still advocates Communism. In the
past two years, however, it has encouraged nationalism and
veneration of its leader, Slobodan Milosevic, over reverence for
Tito.
   The federal government has ordered traffic to stand still as
sirens and horns wail Friday at 3:05 p.m., the hour of Tito's death
10 years ago.
   But even such official respect is waning. The federal parliament
is expected soon to abolish a controversial law that makes public
attacks on Tito or his policies a crime punishable by up to three
years in jail.
   Serbia formally opened parliamentary discussion of the highly
unpopular law, stating that Tito's policies should be evaluated on
historical merit and not protected by the ``absurd law ... (which)
only maintains his personality cult.''
   Serbia's Communist officials and its media have led the attacks
on Tito, a Croat. They claim his policies gave Slovenia and Croatia
an economic edge at the expense of Serbia.
   Newly founded parties in Serbia also make attacks on Tito a
central part of their platform.
   In an illustration of the deep anti-Tito sentiments in Serbia,
several Tito portraits that the law says must hang in government
and public offices have been covered up with calendars and photos
of Milosevic.
   Criticism of Tito in other republics began by centering on his
lavish lifestyle. The former leader maintained more than 60
residences and a fleet of luxurious cars and yachts.
   Increasingly, however, Tito is under fire for punishing
opponents. Former inmates of one of modern Europe's most brutal
prison camps on Goli Otok (Bare Island) off the central Adriatic
coast now appear on television, openly accusing Tito of creating
the camp.
   New publications say up to 5,000 pro-Soviet Communists who
opposed Tito's break with Moscow died in the camp between 1948 and
the mid-1950s.
   Even in his native Croatia, Tito is attacked by men he purged as
alleged Croatian nationalists in 1971. Several have now returned to
politics, doing well in free elections.
   Official initiatives are under way in Slovenia and Montenegro to
return the original names to cities and streets named after Tito
following World War II.
   Plans to erect monuments to Tito in Yugoslavia's main cities
have been scrapped, allegedly for economic reasons.
   The prominent Croatian monthly ``Start'' ironically proposed an
alternative project _ a ``Titoland'' amusement park in Tito's
native Croatian town of Kumrovec.
   In another dig at Tito, recent articles and books reveal alleged
details of the leader's private life with his wife, Jovanka.
   Mrs. Broz, who is fighting a court battle with the state over
what she claims are her and her late husband's personal belongings,
is kept under virtual house arrest in Belgrade, unable to give
interviews or appear in public.
   In a letter printed in the Belgrade Politika daily, Mrs. Broz
protested publications about her life with Tito, saying they ``are
all a part of a long campaign against my husband and myself.''

<HEAD>Alaska Becoming Narcotics Transit Point</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska is becoming a transit point for
Asian heroin and South American cocaine being smuggled into the
United States and Europe, authorities say.
   ``Possibly the couriers feel this is a less-traveled route,''
says Fred Thomas, chief agent of the Drug Enforcement
Administration office in Anchorage. ``Once they clear customs in
Alaska, that's it. Everything going to the Lower 48 is domestic.
   ``The amount of heroin seized here lately would indicate to me
it's a transshipment point,'' he said.
   Customs agents have intercepted several drug shipments at
Anchorage International Airport in recent months, but believe they
have staunched just a fraction of the incoming flow of narcotics.
   The airport, which handles about 250,000 flights a year, is a
strategic refueling stop for trans-polar flights between Europe and
Asia.
   Ninety-eight percent of all air cargo going eastward between the
two continents stops at Anchorage, and 70 percent of cargo sent
from the Lower 48 states to Asia passes through Alaska, says Gina
Marie Lindsey, executive director of the Alaska International
Airport System.
   Intelligence reports also indicate that marijuana from Thailand,
opium from Pakistan and cocaine from South America are being
smuggled in increasing quantities into the United States from Asian
``mother ships'' that transfer their drug cargoes to smaller
vessels along Alaska's jagged, remote shoreline, state and federal
agents say.
   In October, two Nigerians were arrested at the airport for
allegedly attempting to smuggle in one kilogram of nearly pure
heroin. Max Kitchens, head of Customs' enforcement in Alaska, said
that seizure is ``just one indication to us they're using Alaska as
a transit point.''
   Last month, Anchorage police found 45 balloons filled with 9
ounces of heroin inside a toilet at a local jail and suspect it was
left there by a Nigerian detained temporarily at the airport by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Apart from passengers who conceal drugs on their bodies or in
luggage, cargo shipments are a prime method for smugglers,
officials say. Most cargo aircraft passing through Anchorage are
foreign carriers, and many are bound for Europe.
   Last week, 12 pounds of opium from Thailand were found in a
Federal Express shipment passing through the airport, Kitchens
said. It was addressed to a church in Sacramento, Calif., and
discovered during a routine cargo check, he says.
   The last major offshore drug seizure was in 1984, when
authorities found 12.5 tons of marijuana aboard the MV Allison, a
seismological survey ship.
   ``We keep getting intelligence that the same thing is going
on,'' Kitchens says. Reports indicate that freighters have been
bringing cocaine into the United States via Alaska, he said.
   Federal and state officials say they cannot possibly keep guard
on a coastline dotted with thousands of inlets and islands and
stretching from the western Aleutians Islands to south of
Ketchikan. That gives smugglers an advantage, Kitchens said.
   ``They've got so much more resources,'' he said. ``They got more
money than we do.''
   Such routes are enticing to smugglers facing tightened
surveillance along the Mexican border, said Lt. Tom Stearns,
commander of the Alaska State Troopers' Bureau of Drug Enforcement.
   His 23-member special drug squad was set up late last year to
coordinate drug enforcement efforts between state and federal
agencies.
   ``If you look on a map _ all the little coves and things _ it's
just impossible to cover it,'' Kitchens said. ``There is so much
distance and there are so few of us.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: If Mongolia is In, Can Vietnam be Far Behind?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has been making
friendly noises lately toward some countries more accustomed to
scorn than sweet talk.
   Old rivals Iran and Syria are being praised for their role in
helping win the release of American hostages. There even is
evidence of a thaw with two Marxist countries that Washington has
long ignored: Albania and South Yemen.
   This week, the administration is entertaining the deputy prime
minister of Mongolia, Daskiin Byambasuren, the highest ranking
official from that country to visit Washington since it entered the
Soviet orbit in 1921.
   Three years ago, the United States and Mongolia were not on
speaking terms; now they are talking about a trade agreement.
   But there's one old foe where the U.S. attitude has been far
less accommodating: Vietnam. It was 15 years ago this week that the
communist conquest of Vietnam was completed with the collapse of
the Saigon government and the humiliating U.S. departure from that
country.
   Vietnam seems ready for the wound-healing process, but the
United States has put up a host of imposing barriers.
   Washington is demanding that Vietnam find a solution to the
decade-long conflict in Cambodia and that Hanoi withdraw all its
forces from that country permanently. The United States also wants
a maximum accounting for more than 2,300 U.S. troops still listed
as missing in action in Vietnam.
   By making normalization subject to onerous conditions, the
administration is leaving the impression that it is psychologically
difficult for it to make gestures toward the country responsible
for America's greatest military defeat.
   Time magazine chided the administration this week for its tough
stance, asserting that ``Washington continues to act as if Hanoi
had sent its troops to invade Virginia instead of down the Ho Chi
Minh Trail.''
   If the administration really were interested in a normal
relationship, it could rationalize it easily. A spokesman could
explain it this way:
   ``We are prepared to look to the future instead of the past in
our relations with Vietnam. It is logical for the United States to
want diplomatic access to the third largest communist country in
the world. We believe a diplomatic presence in Hanoi would enhance
the possibility of achieving our objectives in that region.''
   A Time-CNN poll indicates the administration may be out of step
with public opinion on the Vietnam question. Three out of five
respondents favor an exchange of ambassadors with Hanoi.
   But The Wall Street Journal believes administration policy is
right on the mark.
   ``Vietnam remains a bastion of repression and a threat to its
neighbors,'' the Journal editorialized. ``It is important to insist
that it first become a civilized nation before offering it friendly
gestures ... In Asia ... there has been no crackup of communist
dictatorships. Neither has there been any significant reduction in
the Pacific military might of Vietnam's big brother, the Soviet
Union.''
   But the state of U.S. relations with Vietnam is not all
negative. Hanoi has been far more accommodating lately in providing
an accounting of missing servicemen and in allowing former
detainees held on political charges to emigrate to the United
States. The offspring of American servicemen also are being given
permission to emigrate in larger numbers.
   And there has been a significant expansion in U.S. private
humanitarian assistance to Vietnam. Since 1987, the U.S. government
has been actively encouraging private groups to send aid to
Vietnamese war victims and to children.
   U.S. officials said that as a result, there has easily been a
four-fold increase in the number of U.S. groups involved in these
tasks and in the value of the assistance provided.
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, wishes the goodwill
shown by private Americans would extend to U.S. officials.
   ``When I meet people from the State Department, their faces
never smile,'' he said. ``It is a pity.''

   Students, townspeople and outsiders flocked
onto the Kent State University campus Thursday to view a new
memorial near the site where Ohio National Guardsmen fatally shot
four students 20 years ago.
   More than 2,000 people staged a candlelight march on the eve of
the memorial's dedication.
   The marchers walked silently from the rain-soaked Commons, the
site of the anti-war protest broken up by National Guard gunfire on
May 4, 1970.
   Earlier about a dozen men, some wearing jackets bearing messages
of ``I'm proud to be a vet,'' filed past the abstract memorial of
four granite slabs flanked by a walkway and guarded by a student
security officer.
   Others stopped to admire 58,175 daffodils _ one representing
each American killed during the Vietnam War.
   The university planned ceremonies Friday to dedicate the
$100,000 memorial to four students who were killed along with nine
wounded by guardsmen during the protests against the Vietnam War.
   Kent State Police Chief John Peach said he expected protests at
the ceremonies but did not think they would be disruptive. The
protesters contend that students and victims were left out of the
planning for the scaled-down memorial to Jeffrey Miller, Sandy
Scheuer, William Schroeder and Allison Krause.
   Peach said there were no plans to seek outside assistance for
the university security force of 32 officers. ``I don't anticipate
much of a presence of police officers in blue uniforms. We will be
using plainclothes officers,'' he said.
   Speakers scheduled for the memorial dedication included former
U.S. Sen. George McGovern; Florence Schroeder, whose son was slain;
and Dean Kahler, an Athens County commissioner who was wounded in
the protest.
   The dedication is to be followed by an annual presentation by
the student-run May 4th Task Force.
   Kurt Myers, a sophomore from Newark, Ohio, and a member of the
task force, said Thursday that the student protest planners don't
want to disrupt the ceremonies.
   ``It will be a silent protest. We will be there with signs and
banners. But there are a lot of us who will want to hear what the
speakers at the dedication have to say,'' Myers said.
   ``A majority of students feel it's important to remember May
4th, but a lot _ especially this year _ seem fed up with so many
people coming in, and I think a lot will decide to leave campus
early for a long weekend,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Grow Brain Cells in Test Tube for First Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   History's first continuous culture of human
brain cells may eventually be used to replace the tissue lost in
the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, stroke or head
injury, said a study published today.
   Dr. Solomon Snyder of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in
Baltimore said his research team used tissue removed from a child
during brain surgery to develop a colony of human brain cells that
divide and grow in laboratory dishes.
   Never before, Snyder said, have scientists been able to coax
human brain cells into growing and reproducing in a laboratory. But
the new cell line can now be expanded at will through thousands
upon thousands of generations, he said.
   Asked why the brain cells taken from the child were able to
divide and grow in the laboratory when so many similar, earlier
efforts had failed, Snyder had no answer.
   ``They clearly had a intrinsic potential to divide more than
conventional neurons,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Just
why, we simply don't know.''
   Other researchers called the discovery one of ``tremendous
significance'' that may cause an explosion of new research and
treatment in brain diseases.
   Although brain cell transplantation is the eventual goal, Snyder
said it will take years of laboratory studies before the brain
cells can be used on human patients.
   A report on the research is published in today's edition of the
journal Science.
   Scientists have long been hampered in their study of the brain
because human brain cells won't reproduce. Except for very limited
exceptions in isolated areas of the brain, humans at birth have all
the brain cells they will ever have.
   If a substantial number of brain cells are damaged by disease,
injury or stroke, functions controlled by those cells are lost
forever.
   Snyder said the cultured cells underwent 3{ years of vigorous
testing to assure they aren't an abnormal growth such as cancer,
but are, in fact, normal brain cells.
   ``We have every confidence that they will function that way when
transplanted,'' he said. ``If they were placed into the environment
of the brain, we would expect them to be functional.''
   Brains damaged by degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, or
by stroke or trauma, may one day be repaired by transplanting cells
grown from the brain cells cultured in the Hopkins lab, Snyder said.
   ``That's what we're working on,'' he said. ``That is our full
intent.''
   The cells that founded the culture were taken from the brain of
an 18-month-old girl who underwent surgery in 1986.
   The young patient was suffering from seizures and doctors
determined that one side of her brain had grown more than the
other. Surgeons removed excess brain tissue to correct the
condition.
   Snyder said one of his students immediately placed about a gram
of brain tissue into a culture medium.
   Two small clusters of cells in the specimen survived after 21
days. Researchers treated those cells with hormones to force them
to mature and develop into normal neurons.
   As far as can be determined, Snyder said, the brain cells are
normal neurons, except they can divide and multiply.
   ``If you put them into a hole in the head, they would grow until
they fill the head and then just stop,'' he said.
   Barbara Bregman, a brain researcher at Georgetown University
here, said it was premature to suggest that the cell line could
eventually be used for brain tissue transplants. But she said the
fact that a living culture of human brain cells has been developed
``is very valuable and exciting'' and will enable scientists to
conduct brain experiments not possible before.
   Dr. John Sladek, chairman of neurobiology at the University of
Rochester School of Medicine, said the Hopkins research is ``of
tremendous significance.''
   If further study confirms that the cells are normal neurons, he
said, there is a ``real possibility'' of one day using the culture
for brain cell transplants in humans.
   Sladek said that in Parkinson's disease research using animals,
``we already know we can insert new nerve cells into a damaged
brain and that those new cells can grow rather vigorously. ... In
the case of monkeys, this will reverse the signs of Parkinson's.''
   Working with Snyder on the study were Gabriele V. Ronnett, Lynda
D. Hester, Jeffrey S. Nye and Karen Connors, all of Johns Hopkins.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   The show business career of Axl
the gray-cheeked parakeet came to a crushing end only hours before
he was to make his national television debut on ``The Tonight
Show.''
   David Cota, a San Jose student, said Thursday that his bird Axl
was killed when Cota's roommate Chris Potthast fell asleep and
rolled on top of the bird in a hotel room provided by NBC.
   ``The bird was sleeping next to my roommate on the bed, and my
roommate fell asleep next to him and rolled over on Axl,'' Cota
said.
   ``I got home about 2 a.m. and I was looking for the bird and I
couldn't find him. I woke Chris up and Axl was underneath him,
dead. Chris didn't think he would fall asleep.''
   The bird, which Cota said had ``a great personality,'' was
buried near Universal Studios, Cota said.
   ``I'm upset and Chris is pretty upset with himself,'' said Cota,
who sent ``The Tonight Show'' a videotape of Axl in action to get
the prized booking for Thursday's program. ``I was pretty excited.
Not too many people make the show.''
   Charlie Barrett, a spokesman for the show, said, ``Obviously,
the show feels very bad about it.'' Johnny Carson presented Cota
with a replacement bird during Thursday night's telecast.
   The program's talent coordinator, Stephanie Ross, visited Cota
and Axl Wednesday afternoon. ``The bird did great,'' Cota said.
``Stephanie couldn't believe it.''
   The 1{-year old bird, named after the lead singer in the rock
band Guns N' Roses, performed a variety of stunts, Cota said. Axl
could roll over, turn around, do a flip on one's finger, stand on
his head, put a beer cap in a cup and play dead.

   Authorities at Beirut airport arrested

marked as books bound for West Germany, police reported.
   A police spokesman said the hashish seized Thursday, to be flown
to Frankfurt, was valued at about $85,000.
   ``The hashish was discovered when a customs employee opened one
of the boxes shortly before it was to be taken on board the

   Police refused to identify the suspects or provide other details.
   Ports in Lebanon's Christian sector are believed the traditional

   The United States is giving up deploying new
land-based nuclear missiles in Europe, but many other,
less-publicized nuclear arms already are in the pipeline.
   Private analysts said Thursday the little-known new weapons,
such as a short-range missile fired from submarines, would more
than offset the loss of firepower from President Bush's decision
not to modernize the land-based Lance missile.
   ``It's like trading two handguns for an assault rifle,'' said
Daniel Plesch, director of the British American Security
Information Council, a private arms group.
   Bush on Thursday also announced cancellation of a modernized
155mm nuclear-tipped artillery shell, although he did not say that
existing shells in Europe would be withdrawn.
   The decisions had been widely anticipated, even though Bush
strenuously argued in favor of these weapons last year. West
Germany and other NATO allies oppose the weapons.
   Bush made no mention of the other nuclear weapons already
planned for European deployment. Private experts said NATO will be
getting more than it's giving up.
   Already in the American nuclear arsenal in Europe are an
estimated 1,400 free-fall bombs carried by the F-111 and other
European-based aircraft; about 1,200 artillery shells; 200 depth
bombs to kill submarines and 700 aging Lance missiles.
   The most important new weapon earmarked for European deployment
is an air-to-surface nuclear missile that could be carried on the
American F-16 fighters based in Europe and the new F-15E nuclear
strike aircraft now in production.
   The leading candidate for an air-to-surface missile is the
Short-Range Attack Missile-Tactical, which the Air Force is
reported to be developing with a range of about 250 miles.
   William Arkin, an arms expert with the environmental group
Greenpeace U.S.A., said the Air Force wants to start deploying the
air-to-surface missile in Europe by 1995 with a total purchase for
European use of about 300 missiles.
   The advantage of an air-to-surface missile is that it would give
the air forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a
capability, in the event of a nuclear war, to ``stand off'' from
the battlefront and still hit Soviet territory.
   The United States now has no air-to-surface nuclear missiles in
Europe. Britain and France reportedly are cooperating to develop
their own missiles of this type.
   The now-canceled Lance missile, which was to replace the
existing Lance arsenal, would not have been capable of reaching
Soviet territory.
   Bush did not say he would withdraw any of the existing Lances,
and Plesch said it was possible that NATO could agree to refurbish
them to extend their useful lives. The Pentagon has said the Lances
are due to become obsolete by the mid-1990s.
   Among other weapons in the pipeline are more U.S. shorter-range
nuclear missiles for deployment on attack submarines based in the
North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Arkin said about 350 of
these, called the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, already have been
deployed. Bush's 1991 budget calls for buying 75 more.
   The Pentagon also is developing new versions of its nuclear
gravity bombs and anti-submarine depth bombs.
   The Soviet Union also has a large short-range nuclear
capability, although it is unclear how their deployments may be
affected by the demise of the Warsaw Pact as a cohesive military
force.
   The Soviets have urged immediate negotiations to eliminate all
shorter-range nuclear weapons in Europe, but the Bush
administration has refused. NATO leaders decided last year they
would put off any such negotiations until after an East-West treaty
is signed to reduce non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Arkin said the Soviets have more than 1,400 launchers for
short-range nuclear systems based on land, including about 660 FROG
missiles built in the 1960s, 300 SS-21 missiles that are equivalent
to the U.S. Lance missiles and about 500 Scud-B missiles.

   So it goes two evenings each week for the 14 formerly illegal
aliens in Evertz's ``amnesty class'' at Hostos Community College in
the South Bronx, one of several campuses of the City University of
New York offering such courses.
   For the more than half a million immigrants nationwide who have
so far completed these classes _ 100,000 in New York alone _ it's a
first chance to emerge from the shadows of American life, to
replace daily fear with the refreshing breath of knowledge _ often
laced with a joke or two.
   ``Most have been in this country at least five years. All that
time they've been in the shadows. For a lot of them this is a big
opportunity _ to learn English without being turned in,'' said Jim
Roth, who trains amnesty teachers at CUNY.
   By day, Evertz's students are factory workers, truck drivers,
seamstresses. They came here from the Dominican Republic, Mexico,
Colombia, Peru, Central America. At 6 p.m., they gather in a
Spartan classroom in a converted trailer surrounded by coiled razor
wire to learn English and American civics.
   Such amnesty classes have been offered nationwide for the last
two years at hundreds of community colleges, public schools,
churches, charitable organizations and proprietary schools.
   They exist for the 1.7 million formerly illegal aliens who came
forward during the federal amnesty program that lasted for a year
beginning May 4, 1987.
   Those who revealed themselves gained temporary residence status
and had 30 months to fulfill requirements for permanent status.
Most amnesty classes will shut down around November, the deadline
for most to fulfill their requirements for permanent status.
   The requirements include either demonstrated competence in
English and civics, or attendance at least 40 hours of amnesty
classes.
   Critics have cited the near-impossibility of teaching English in
40 hours. But officials of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which administers the program, and teachers and pupils,
think such criticism misses the point.
   ``Forty hours is not enough to learn English. We can all agree
on that,'' said Janet Charney, deputy assistant commissioner of the
legalization division of the INS in Washington. ``But the purpose
was to get people indoctrinated into the culture, and help them
gain some survival skills .. we have found that many have gone on
to further study.''
   The amnesty classes are ``an aperitif to show these people that
they can learn,'' agreed Adolfo Calovini, a teacher at Hostos who
speaks six languages and helped develop that school's amnesty
curriculum.
   The classes could hardly be described as rigorous, and the INS
allows schools wide latitude in what should be taught.
   Virtually everyone attending the necessary 40 hours will get a
``certificate of satisfactory pursuit'' required to go from
temporary to permanent residence status.
   The first weeks of the course are spent teaching students
English phrases needed for everyday life, ``my name is...'', ``I
live at...'', and survival skills like handling telephone
conversations.
   After about twenty hours, the course tackles civics. At Hostos,
teachers talk about the history and significance of national
holidays like July 4th, Columbus Day and Martin Luther King's
birthday.
   Eventually, the classes will study the basics of the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and features of government.
   Roberto Flores, a beer truck driver with a wife and son who
crossed the Mexican border illegally in 1981, said he is no longer
afraid about his immigrant status.
   ``It's a very good class. In my job, I must speak English and
this helps me,'' he said.
   But as relaxed as Evertz tries to make his class, fear lingers
among immigrants still unaccustomed to dealing with official
institutions.
   Several in Evertz's class looked worried one evening as a
reporter scribbled notes and a photographer clicked off shots.
   ``Don't worry, they're not agents. They're from the TV show,
`Lives of the Rich &amp; Famous,'' said Evertz, as his studnts laughed
again.

   Freed hostage Robert Polhill says he still
feels weak but hopes to leave the hospital as soon as he has enough
voice to ``talk my way out.''
   Polhill, 55, slipped out of the hospital Thursday to celebrate
his 10th wedding anniversary with his wife, Ferial, at a small
homecoming dinner.
   Polhill presented his wife with aluminum roses in honor of their
anniversary and followed them with a box of live yellow roses.
   ``I'm in heaven,'' Mrs. Polhill said.
   The couple received congratulatory notes from President Bush and
from Polhill's favorite singer, Frank Sinatra. They also were
greeted by Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., since Polhill is a big fan of
the New York Knicks basketball team, for which Bradley once played.
   Polhill, noting that another freed hostage, Frank Reed, was due
to return to the United States today, said, ``I would be very happy
to see Frank Reed and I will be happier as the days go on to see
the other fellows'' who remain captive in Lebanon.
   Speaking in a soft, raspy voice, Polhill said he still feels
weak but hopes to be released from the hospital ``as soon as I can
talk.''
   ``I have to be able to talk my way out,'' he said. Doctors at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where Polhill is being treated,
said he has a growth on his vocal cords.
   The Polhills celebrated their first anniversary together in four
years at a reception and dinner sponsored by No Greater Love, a
Washington-based humanitarian organization serving as a support
group for the hostage families.
   The dinner at a posh Washington hotel featured Polhill's
favorite dessert, an assortment of chocolate dishes including one
topped with a chocolate butterfly to symbolize freedom.
   The dinner guests included Peggy Say, the sister of Terry
Anderson, the longest-held Americn hostage in Lebanon. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
seized March 16, 1985, in Beirut.
   Anderson is one of six Americans among the 16 Western kidnap
victims still missing in Lebanon.
   Polhill was freed April 22 after 39 months in captivity. He was
a business professor at the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University
College when he was abducted by terrorists on Jan. 24, 1987.
Polhill, a diabetic, lost 25 pounds while in captivity.

<HEAD>Owners of Huge Pearl Looking for Someone to Shell Out Millions</HEAD>

   The biggest pearl in the world weighs 14
pounds, is the size and shape of a human brain, and must have been
a pain in the neck of the clam that bore it, say its owners, who
expect $25 million for its sale.
   Variously known as the Pearl of Allah and the Pearl of Lao-Tzu,
the natural pearl went on display Thursday and later will be shown
to prospective buyers.
   The Guinness Book of Records says it is the largest of its kind
in the world. Part owner Peter Hoffman, a jewelry dealer, said he
had been told the pearl was worth from $25 million to $50 million.
   The pearl's stock is boosted by the romantic legend that says it
grew 2,500 years ago when Chinese philosopher-spiritualist Lao-Tzu
had a small amulet placed in a clam.
   People who gaze upon the stone are said to see the images of
Buddha, Confucius and Lao-Tzu. The Filipino tribal chief who once
owned it declared it a gift from God. A diver is said to have
drowned prying it from a clam.
   Jewelry dealer Peter Hoffman said he and co-owner Victor Barbish
might sell the pearl to a museum it they can assure it will be
properly insured, safeguarded and displayed.
   ``I think it's that kind of an item that can do nothing but good
if it was on public display,'' Hoffman said. ``Since I first saw it
I think I have become a more spiritual person.''
   Hoffman and Barbish bought the pearl for $200,000 from the
estate of American archaeologist Wilburn D. Cobb in 1980. Cobb
received it from a Moslem tribal chief in the Philippines whose son
Cobb had treated for malaria.
   Barbish became entangled in a legal dispute with two other
people he sold an interest to, and a court ordered the pearl sold
as part of the settlement.
   According to the legend, the pearl grew to its present size as
it was handed down for centuries to Lao-Tzu's descendants. The
descendants would periodically replant the gem in bigger clams,
allowing it to continue to grow.
   The pearl and the giant clam that was holding it were lost in a
typhoon that hit the Philippines sometime during the Ming dynasty,
which ruled China from 1368 to 1644.
   It was recovered in 1934 by a Filipino diver who reportedly
drowned trying to take it away from the clam.
   Eventually brought to the surface, it became the property of a
Moslem tribal chief, who said it resembled the turban-wrapped head
of Mohammed. Thus it acquired the name Pearl of Allah.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Sets Hearing for Durenberger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger says the Senate Ethics
Committee is pushing him to settle allegations that he broke Senate
rules and federal law in his financial dealings.
   The Minnesota Republican said Thursday that his attorney had
been talking informally with the committee's special counsel, but
he declined to give details.
   The committee voted Thursday to begin two weeks of public
hearings on the allegations on June 12.
   ``It's a matter of wanting to bring this to a head,'' said
Durenberger, who agreed to an interview about the investigation for
the first time since January. ``Whether the hearing is going to be
necessary we'll have to wait until early June to make a decision.''
   The ethics panel found in February that there was ``substantial
credible evidence'' of violations involving a $100,000 book
promotion deal and free limousine service that Durenberger accepted.
   The committee decided to continue its investigation into Senate
reimbursement that Durenberger received for a condominium he partly
owned, said Wilson Abney, the panel's chief of staff.
   Durenberger said he expected the committee to add the
condominium deal to the list of possible violations it would pursue
at the June hearings.
   The proceedings would be canceled if Durenberger negotiated an
agreement with the committee to settle the case.
   The committee can recommend any of several different penalties,
including censure, expulsion or loss of seniority or
responsibility. The panel also could refer the case to the Justice
Department for a criminal investigation.
   Durenberger admits to lapses in judgment but denies any willful
wrongdoing.
   The committee has said it is investigating 113 paid appearances
by Durenberger in 1985 and 1986 where the senator arranged to
charge fees for speeches and split the proceeds with Piranha Press
of Minneapolis, the publisher of two books he wrote.
   The deal may have broken federal law as well as Senate rules,
the committee said.
   Some of the organizations that invited Durenberger to speak said
they considered the appearances standard paid speeches and that his
books were never mentioned. Paid speeches count toward the outside
earnings limits for members of Congress.
   The committee also said Durenberger may have broken limits on
receipts of gifts by accepting nearly $5,000 worth of limousine
trips for personal travel in the Boston area in 1985 and 1986.
   The committee has been investigating the condominium deal since
December, when a newspaper disclosed that he charged the Senate
rent when he stayed in his Minneapolis condominium from 1983 to
1989.
   Durenberger repaid the Senate $11,005 in January after the Rules
Committee decided he was not entitled to expenses when he stayed at
the condo during congressional recesses.

<TEXT>
   For a man who's not running for president, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson sure has been busy down South.
   He was at a conference on blacks and the environment in Atlanta
last month and came back for Earth Day festivities. Then he trekked
across four Southern states, pitching organized labor among textile
and factory workers.
   The revitalized Georgia chapter of his National Rainbow
Coalition has been registering voters on behalf of Democratic
gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Young, who was booed by Jackson
delegates at the 1984 National Democratic Convention.
   This week, Jackson is back in Atlanta again at a conference with
Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown and Virginia Gov.
Douglas Wilder, the keynote speaker at a Saturday banquet.
   Jackson, who ducked a chance to run for mayor of Washington,
D.C., denies his appearances are a prelude to a presidential bid in
1992. But that's what it looks like to political science professor
Merle Black of Emory University.
   ``Everything he is doing is consistent with becoming an active
candidate again,'' said Black, who said 1992 is too far away for
Jackson's activities to make an impact.
   ``This is just a way of keeping himself active and visible,'' he
said.
   ``It's not a campaign agenda. It's a freedom agenda,'' Jackson
said in an interview. ``Where we once marched and took the steps
necessary to end racial inequality by law, we must now end economic
inequality by law. There must be a new appraisal of the South.''
   Brown sought Thursday to dispel criticism of Jackson's role in
Democratic politics, saying it pains him to hear talk of Jackson
``as if he were some kind of impediment'' to the party's success in
presidential politics.
   ``In fact, he's one of the greatest assets to our party. We want
to tell the truth about that,'' Brown said. ``He was not the reason
we do not have a Democrat in the White House.''
   Joe Beasley, interim state coordinator of the Rainbow Coalition,
said getting Young elected is his immediate concern. But asked
about a possible Jackson presidential bid, he said, ``In my mind,
that's always a live option.''

<TEXT>
   An architectural firm that played a key role
in development of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial here will spearhead
execution of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, across the
Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam site.
   Retired Army Gen. Richard B. Stilwell, chairman of the Korean
War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board, announced Thursday that the
Army Corps of Engineers has selected a team headed by Cooper-Lecky
Architects of Washington to provide architectural, engineering
design and construction administration services.
   W. Kent Cooper, chairman of the board of Cooper-Lecky, who led
the design development team for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, said
a sculptor for the Korean Veterans Memorial will be selected by
July 1.
   The design concept calls for 38 statues of heroic size in a
medium still to be determined. They will line a path that will
ascend from an open plaza near the Lincoln Memorial to a point
where an American flag will fly.
   The site has a view of the Washington Monument and, in the
distance, the Capitol.
   Cooper said the memorial will be roughly the same size as the
one to Vietnam veterans.
   William P. Lecky, president of Cooper-Lecky, said the sculpture
is expected to take two to three years to execute.
   Stilwell, who commanded troops in Korea, said ground might be
broken on Nov. 11, 1991, and organizers hope to have a dedication
on July 27, 1993, the 40th anniversary of the end of the Korean
hostilities.
   He said about $6 million of a goal of $11 million has been
raised.
   Congress authorized the memorial in 1986.
   ``Having selected this magnificent site, having selected an
equally magnificent, truly heroic design concept of what will
ultimately be erected on this site, we are moving directly to the
next milestone,'' Stilwell said.

   More than 50,000 pieces of mail have flooded
into Jeanne White's home since her son Ryan died from AIDS.
   ``We still haven't even gotten the mail open yet,'' Mrs. White
said Wednesday, shaking her head, although Phil Donahue and his
wife Marlo Thomas hired a secretary to help Mrs. White to sort
through the letters.
   She and the secretary, Shelley Henson, are still opening
get-well letters that arrived at Riley Hospital for Children in
Indianapolis before White died of complications from acquired
immune deficiency syndrome on April 8.
   White, 18, became a well-known spokesman for AIDS education
after fighting a lengthy court battle to attend public school.
   ``It's surprising everybody is still calling,'' Mrs. White said.
``I can't believe how many kids he touched.''
   Now the favor is being returned from people all over the world.
She digs through the piles of mail to read favorite pieces out loud
to Henson and displays the large banners sent from school children
from across the country.
   It's a healing process, she said. But Henson finds it difficult.
   ``I know I probably cry an average of four times a day,'' she
said.
   Mrs. White has been on leave of absence since last fall, when
Ryan began suffering more frequent bouts of illness. She said she
is considering early retirement to further her son's work in AIDS
education.
   ``I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' said Mrs. White, who is
being helped financially by celebrity friends whom she declined to
indentify.
   About $35,000 has been donated to four funds set up in her son's
name, Mrs. White said.
   The Ryan White Memorial Fund was established to help Mrs. White
pay for her son's medical care and funeral. The other funds, for
education and other AIDS-related work, are the Ryan White
Children's Fund, AIDS Research for Children and the Ryan White
Fund, sponsored by the Los Angeles-based Athletes and Entertainers
for Kids.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A promised $24-billion-a-year shift of federal
tax burden to corporations is not materializing and individuals are
making up the difference, the government says.
   But the news is not as bad as it might sound for individual
taxpayers. Their share of the federal burden is dropping and they
are paying about $24 billion a year more than forecast only because
their incomes are rising faster than predicted.
   Witnesses told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that the
inability to make precise estimates is chiefly to blame for the
fact that corporations are paying less taxes than were anticipated
when Congress wrote the landmark 1986 tax overhaul.
   ``Approximately 58 percent of the shortfall in corporate income
tax receipts over the 1987-89 period is attributable to
lower-than-expected projected profits,'' Robert D. Reischauer,
director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the committee.
   ``Corporate profits are volatile and, therefore, notoriously
difficult to forecast,'' Reischauer said.
   ``The primary reason ... is that pre-tax corporate profits came
in below expectations,'' Harvey S. Rosen, deputy assistant
secretary of the treasury, agreed.
   One reason that corporate earnings were lower than expected is
that individual incomes rose faster than projected, witnesses
testified. Those wage increases gave individuals larger taxable
incomes and _ because wages are a deductible expense _ gave
corporations less taxable income.
   Robert McIntyre, director of the labor-funded Citizens for Tax
Justice, blamed the tax shortfall on a tendency for corporations to
borrow, rather than issue stock, to finance expansion. This
borrowing wave was highlighted in the late 1980s by corporate
takeovers financed by leveraged buyouts.
   ``Corporations are sending their profits to bondholders rather
than paying dividends to shareholders and taxes to the Treasury,''
McIntyre said.
   Rosen, the Treasury official, said available evidence suggests
little connection between buyout borrowing and the tax shortage.
   A major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul was to shift about $24
billion a year of tax burden from individuals to corporations. In
the 1987-89 period, corporate taxes fell $63 billion short of
Congressional Budget Office forecasts and $65 billion below the
administration estimate.
   When the new law was approved, the government estimated that
individual income taxes would average $391 billion a year in
1987-89. Collections actually averaged $413 billion a year.
   The corporate share of income taxes rose from 15 percent in 1986
to 19 percent in 1989, Rosen said, while the individual share
dropped from 85 percent to 81 percent.
   Even so, Reischauer said, corporate taxes have failed to keep
pace with economic growth. ``Corporate taxes measured 4 percent of
gross national product in 1960; by 1986, the amount had declined to
1.5 percent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lehder Says Colombian Drug Lords Funded Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former kingpin of the Medellin drug cartel
said Colombian drug lords donated about $20 million to the
U.S.-backed Contras in Nicaragua.
   Carlos Lehder Rivas, 40, made his remarks in a broadcast
Thursday night of ABC's PrimeTime Live, which interviewed him in
the federal prison in Marion, Ill., where Lehder is serving a life
sentence plus 135 years.
   ``We did give a great deal of money to the Contra cause ... I
gave. We put up the first time about $10 million to the Contras,''
said Lehder, whose hands were shackled during the interview. ``(In
all) around $20 million in cash went to help the Contras.''
   Adolfo Calero, a former director of the Nicaraguan Resistance,
an umbrella group for the Contras, denied Lehder's allegations.
   ``We never had one cent from them,'' Calero said in a telephone
interview from his Miami home. ``We know where all our
contributions came from.''
   Lehder was convicted in May 1988 after a 7{-month trial in
Jacksonville, Fla., on charges of cocaine smuggling and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. He and others were accused of
smuggling some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States from
Colombia from 1978 to 1980.
   Lehder also accused John Hull, an American who directed supplies
for the Contras from Costa Rica, of cocaine trafficking. Hull, who
now lives in the United States, denied the allegations, the news
program reported.
   ``I do know the situation for a fact that John Hull in Costa
Rica ... he was talking about 30 tons of cocaine into the United
States a year,'' Lehder said. ``Now this is a kingpin.''
   Hull, 70, faces charges in Costa Rica ranging from aiding the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels to involvement in a terrorist bombing.
Costa Rican officials have said they plan to seek his extradition
from the United States.
   A Costa Rican government commission that investigated Contra
activity there accused Hull of involvement in a network that
``allowed Colombian and Panamanian drug traffickers to transport
drugs to the United States in exchange for arms for the Contras.''
   In March, friends of Hull held a news conference in Washington
and read a statement from him denying the charges and contending
they were based on perjured statements. Hull now lives in Indiana.
   Lehder also discussed ousted Panamanian dictator, Manuel
Noriega, who is awaiting trial in Miami on charges he took money
from the Medellin drug cartel to make Panama a safe haven for
cocaine smuggling.
   ``Noriega was always on the payroll of American intelligence,
but he was always also on the payroll of the Soviet intelligence,
the Cuban intelligence and the Israeli intelligence,'' he said.
``At the same time, he was on the payroll of some Colombian
traffickers. He was working every side of the corner.''

   Del. Ben Blaz, D-Guam, admits he's
hypersensitive about Old Glory. That's why the scene at the U.S.
ambassador's residence in London made his blood boil.
   There, larger than life, was the Texas state flag for all to see
as they drove up to the elegant house now inhabited by Ambassador
Henry Catto, a native Texan appointed by President Bush, an adopted
Texan.
   Blaz, a retired Marine Corps general and a nonvoting delegate to
Congress, says he's got nothing against the Lone Star State. He
just doesn't think its flag should dwarf the Stars and Stripes.
   ``I'm one of those guys who loves flags,'' said Blaz, who
noticed the prominence of the Texas flag when he visited Catto's
residence on an official trip last fall. The American flag,
meantime, was off to the side and less visible.
   ``I think we've got the thing reversed,'' said Blaz, who brought
the issue to the attention of State Department officials this week
at a House committee hearing on embassy buildings. ``It really kind
of bothered me.''
   Arthur Fort, the assistant secretary of state for
administration, told Blaz his message would be delivered to Catto.
That was done Wednesday, officials said.
   Blaz said he didn't know if anything had been done on the flag
placement front, but ``I expect it will be.''

   About 359,000 children were kidnapped in 1988,
and the overwhelming majority were abducted by family members, not
by strangers, a new study says.
   ``The size of the family abduction problem really did surprise
us,'' said David Finkelhor of the University of New Hampshire, one
of the researchers who produced the study for the Justice
Department. ``We had expected 25,000 to 100,000. That was the going
estimate.''
   The researchers estimated that in 1988, 354,100 children were
abducted by relatives. As many as 4,600 children were kidnapped by
strangers _ 1.4 percent of the total number of abductions _
according to the study released Thursday.
   However, only 200 to 300 of those cases conformed with a common
public perception of how kidnappings occur _ a forcible abduction
by a stranger who keeps the child for a long period of time and
possibly kills the victim.
   Such cases include the highly publicized disappearance of
5-year-old Melissa Brannen from a Christmas party in Virginia and
the kidnapping by a masked gunman of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling
in Minnesota.
   Many brief encounters were included among the approximately
4,600 abductions by strangers estimated in the study, based on
police records.
   ``The thousands of rapes of children that occur each year
include abduction,'' Finkelhor said in an interview.
   At any rate, the number could not compare with the 354,100
children abducted by family members.
   ``It's clear that we haven't paid enough attention to the family
abduction problem,'' said Finkelhor, who conducted the study with
Gerald Hotaling of the University of Lowell in Massachusetts and
Andrea Sedlak of Westat Inc.
   Finkelhor said such abductions are a reflection ``of how rampant
divorce is, how bitter custody fights are.''
   Most of the perpetrators were men and most of the victims were
ages 2 to 11. Few infants or older teens were abducted by family
members.
   Children abducted by parents usually are not harmed physically,
but Finkelhor said, ``This is very stressful for kids. It does
leave scars.''
   The fact that only 1.4 percent of all abductions of children are
committed by strangers should not completely reduce parents' fears
of strangers, said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children.
   ``If there are 300 Melissa Brannens a year, that's 10 elementary
school classrooms full,'' Allen said. ``That's a tremendous
concern.''
   The study, required by the 1984 Missing Children Act, also shows
that 450,700 children ran away in 1988; 127,100 were ``thrown
away,'' abandoned or forced out of their homes by their parents;
and 438,200 were lost, injured or otherwise missing, many for short
periods of time.
   In addition, 114,600 children were subjected to possible
attempted kidnapping, the study said.

<HEAD>Democrats Split Over Weekend Budget Meeting With Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are variously
expressing enthusiasm, indifference and distress over talks that
President Bush says may help prevent a political stalemate over the
federal budget.
   Bush announced Thursday that he has invited congressional
leaders to a White House meeting Sunday focusing on ``where we go
now'' in the slow-moving budget process.
   ``We've got to move forward, and I've got to find a way to do
that,'' he said.
   The president proposed the meeting in a week in which the Senate
Budget Committee and the House have adopted separate,
Democratic-written budgets for next year. Each one strips nearly
$10 billion from Bush's own military spending proposal for fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Congress is supposed to finish its budget blueprint by April 15
but rarely meets that deadline.
   The document sets non-binding guidelines for the government's
fiscal plans and does not require the president's approval.
Programs are financed and taxes are raised or lowered in later,
separate bills that require his signature.
   Administration officials and Republican lawmakers have been
pressing all year for budget negotiations. They have said that they
and congressional Democrats must solve their differences over
defense spending, taxes and other areas before serious deficit
reduction can be accomplished.
   Democrats have been split over the idea of talks. Some believe
that cooperation with Bush is needed, while others argue that
Congress' majority party needs to define its own budget priorities.
   The two Democratic leaders who will be attending the talks
showed little enthusiasm for Sunday's session and volunteered
nothing about what they expected to accomplish.
   ``We have to be prepared to discuss whatever the president
wants,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said simply:
``I have said many times that I would meet with the president at
his request at anytime about any subject. Yesterday when the
president asked me to come to the White House to discuss the
budget, I accepted.''
   Others showed more zeal for the prospects of negotiations.
   ``Great idea,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. ``I think they
could give us more direction about what the president wants to do
about the deficit.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said he saw the session as an important first step
toward what could evolve into a full-fledged budget summit later in
the year.
   ``But you can't have a successful summit without everything on
the table,'' including the tax increases Bush has opposed in the
past, Panetta added.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said that for the session to be successful, Bush would
have to convince Mitchell that the administration is ready to move
decisively to reduce the deficit.
   ``I've seen no evidence the administration is seriously
interested in reducing this deficit,'' he said.
   Others expressed disdain for the idea of a summit. Many members
of Congress resented the budget negotiations of the past few years,
arguing that they end up freezing most lawmakers out of the fiscal
process.
   ``It eliminates many of the cumbersome, clumsy aspects of
democracy and replaces them with the efficiency of an edict,'' said
Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., a member of the House Budget
Committee. ``King George III would have loved it.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., are also scheduled to attend the
meeting.

<HEAD>Political Pressure May Have Changed Decision on Alaskan Causeway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee is considering whether
improper political pressure led the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
reverse itself on an Alaska construction permit sought by the oil
industry.
   The issue involves federal permits for the construction of
massive gravel causeways that would connect points along Alaska's
North Slope to offshore drilling sites.
   Two such causeways have been built and requests for additional
permits are under consideration or are expected.
   The oil industry says the causeways _ up to several miles long _
are essential to developing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. Environmentalists say they harm the region's ecology and
fish and violate federal clean water laws.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Interior
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, sought
to show at a hearing Thursday that political pressure was put on
the Corps over the past 18 months on specific causeway permit cases.
   Miller said information in internal documents ``starts to
suggest a political decision was made .... Rather extraordinary
means were taken to see if the decisions could be neutralized.''
   The Corps district engineer for Alaska, Col. William Kakel,
decided in October 1988 that the 6,600-foot long Niakuk causeway on
the North Slope should not be built because of potential harm to
fish and water quality in violation of the federal Clean Water Act.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had said the causeway
threatened aquatic habitat.
   As part of his decision, Kakel suggested that British Petroleum
find alternatives to the gravel causeway. He also issued new
guidelines on causeway permits that suggested oil companies first
look at other ways to work out their problems such as directional
drilling or underwater pipes.
   But four months later, Kakel's guidelines were rescinded and he
was told to reopen the Niakuk case.
   Kakel denied in testimony Thursday that he was pressured by
superiors for purely political reasons and said the Niakuk permit
case was still active and may be decided soon.
   His superior, Maj. Gen. Patrick Kelly, director of civil works
at the Corps, maintained that Kakel's decision was rescinded only
because of procedural problems and not from political pressure or
industry lobbying. He said the colonel had no authority to issue
general policy guidelines.
   But Robert Oja, chief of the regulatory branch of the Corps'
Alaska district, said pressure from the oil company, which lobbied
vigorously in Washington after Kakel made his decision, prompted
the reversal.
   Oja testified as a government ``whistleblower'' which provides
him with additional protection against possible retaliation.
   He said the events surrounding the decision ``convey a strong
message about how an industry has systematically and successfully
lobbied its self-interests at the expense of the public's trust.''
   ``At the very least, this information suggests incidents of
abuse of authority, waste and improper command influence,'' he
continued, adding that ``a well-entrenched system ... has grossly
twisted the regulatory and scientific processes.''
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, in a draft recommendation, urged
against building the causeway, citing concern about the impact on
fish flows, testified Paul Gertler, a former field officer in
Alaska and now Fish and Wildlife's coordinator for the Exxon Valdez
oil spill.
   But he said under the direction of senior Interior Department
officials, the draft was changed, ``resulting in a letter that
omitted all of the service's technical information on fish and
wildlife resources and the potential impacts of the causeway ... as
well as the service's recommendation that (the Kiakuk) permit ...
be denied.''

   Barbara Bush's selection as Wellesley
College's commencement speaker has divided the campus and alumnae,
some of whom question why the college picked a woman known for her
husband's achievements.
   The feminist controversy at the private, all-women's college
drew comment Thursday from President Bush, who told reporters his
wife's work as a mother and as an advocate of literacy could teach
students a lot.
   Several graduates of Wellesley agreed, but others said she was
not the best choice for speaker at the June 1 commencement on the
tranquil campus nestled in a corner of this posh Boston suburb.
   Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith College, Wellesley's sister
school, in 1944 to marry Bush, then a Navy pilot. She said earlier
in the week that about 125 Wellesley students who signed a petition
against her coming ``were very reasonable'' but would not prompt
her to stay away.
   Mrs. Bush was the second choice of the school's seniors. They
first picked feminist writer Alice Walker, who declined.
   Anne Bernays, who graduated from Wellesley in 1952 and has
written eight books, said she was ``very angry'' about the
selection of Mrs. Bush, but she said she was angry with the senior
class and not the first lady.
   ``I didn't understand (at first) that it was the senior class
who picked her, which is even worse,'' she said. ``Barbara Bush is
wonderful, but she was invited to speak at Wellesley because she is
married to the president.''
   The university named Mrs. Bush as commencement speaker on the
2,200-student campus in mid-March. A protest petition appeared in
April.
   ``To honor Barbara Bush as commencement speaker is to honor a
woman who has gained recognition through the achievements of her
husband, which contradicts what we have been taught over our years
at Wellesley,'' the petition said.
   Susana Cardenas, a leader of the protesting students, has
received threatening phone calls and letters, college officials
told The New York Times.
   In Washington, the president said he and his wife were not
bothered by the controversy.
   ``I think that these young women can have a lot to learn from
Barbara Bush and from her unselfishness and from her advocacy of
literacy and of being a good mother and a lot of other things,'' he
said.
   Bush was asked if there was any merit to the argument that his
wife's accomplishments are related in large part to her marriage to
him. ``I can't make an argument with that,'' he said.
   Mrs. Bush defended her life choices to reporters at a Wednesday
luncheon.
   ``I don't think they understand where I'm coming from,'' she
said. ``I chose to live the life I've lived and I think it's been a
fabulously exciting, interesting, involved life.''
   ``I have enormous respect for Barbara Bush,'' said Susan
Estrich, who graduated from Wellesley in 1974 and managed Michael
Dukakis' failed bid to defeat Bush for the presidency in 1988.
   ``I don't think feminism should limit its definition of
accomplishment to women who have secured careers entirely on their
own. I think there should be tremendous value attached to women who
are wives and mothers,'' she said.
   Nan Keohane, president of Wellesley, said the debate itself
serves a purpose _ to publicize disagreements over what feminism is.
   ``Feminism is very hard to pin down, but it is certainly not
anti-family,'' she said. ``What we try to teach is that nobody of
either sex should be defining their lives just in terms of making
money.''
   Nina Budd Scott, who graduated from Wellesley in 1959, said she
was angered when she first heard of the selection of Mrs. Bush, but
became less so when she learned that the first lady was a second
choice after Ms. Walker.
   ``I'm still not happy with it. I think that there are other
people ... who have really achieved a lot,'' Scott said. ``I don't
feel hostile about Mrs. Bush, but I just don't feel she's the right
person.''

<HEAD>Group of Seven to Address Japanese Yen, Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is playing down the
lack of progress in strengthening the shaky Japanese yen as
economic chiefs from the world's major industrial powers prepare
for a weekend gathering.
   Only a month ago, the so-called Group of Seven promised to work
against the weak yen's ``undesirable consequences'' for the world
economy and U.S. trade deficit. Nevertheless, the yen's value
remains near a three-year low against the dollar.
   A weak yen tends to hurt the trade deficit by making American
goods more expensive in Japan and Japanese goods more affordable in
the United States.
   A senior Treasury Department official, briefing reporters
Thursday on condition of anonymity, sought to minimize rate
problems by noting the stability of currency markets since the
Group of Seven's April 7 meeting in Paris.
   Coordinated yen buying by major central banks around the world
has helped prevent the Japanese currency from falling further.
   However, the official conceded that U.S. officials ``continue to
be concerned about the general level of the yen,'' which by April
had fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar since the start
of the year.
   The official said exchange rates will be among the topics
covered Sunday when finance ministers and central bank chiefs from
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France,
Canada and Italy confer in advance of the spring meetings of the
152-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   Finance officials also will be wrestling with the politically
touchy problem of increasing the resources of the IMF, reviewing
progress in easing the crushing $1.3 trillion debt burden on Third
World countries and evaluating West Germany's plans to forge a
monetary union with East Germany.
   Some private economists accuse the Group of Seven of minimizing
exchange rate problems because they cannot agree on how to fix them.
   C. Fred Bergsten, a former Treasury official who now heads the
Washington think tank, the Institute for International Economics,
warned that the U.S. trade gap, which has fallen for the past two
years, could soon start growing again.
   ``I think there's a strange sense of complacency among the G-7
members, except for the Japanese. When officials can't come up with
solutions, they tend to deny problems so they don't look
ineffective in solving them,'' Bergsten said.
   However, in a speech to the U.S. Information Agency conference
earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the
yen's decline has been helpful in preventing financial market
turmoil in Tokyo from spilling into other stock exchanges around
the world.
   ``The truth of the matter is the system has worked very well.
The change in investors' feelings about the Japanese market have
translated into a decline of the yen against other currencies but
that has to be,'' Brady said.
   Rather than exchange rates, Group of Seven officials will be
spending much of their time wrestling with the increase in IMF
resources, known as quotas.
   The senior Treasury official said IMF members could settle the
matter next week and appear to have a consensus for an approximate
50 percent quota increase from $120 billion to $180 billion.
   The U.S. share of the added $60 billion would amount to about
$12 billion. The contribution is a commitment and does not count
against the budget deficit.
   IMF officials warn that 50 percent may not be enough for the
fund to meet its growing responsibility in Eastern Europe and
continue supporting Third World debtors.
   But, the Treasury official countered, ``There's no shortage of
resources at the moment.''
   On the issue of Third World debt, the Bush administration is
painting the Brady plan, named after the Treasury secretary, as a
success. Introduced in March 1989, it emphasizes debt reduction _
as opposed to new lending _ more strongly than past U.S. strategies.
   So, far Mexico and the Philippines have concluded final debt
reduction agreements with creditor banks. Venezuela, Costa Rica,
Chile and Morocco have agreements in principle.

   NATO has launched its drive to ensure
the Western military alliance does not become a rusted relic but
instead functions as a key component in new European security
structures.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner told a news conference
Thursday that the group ``is taking advantage of the historic
opportunity to move beyond confrontation to cooperation.''
   He was speaking at the end of a special meeting of foreign
ministers of the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. With reduced East-West tensions, NATO is under
pressure to reduce its military role and increase its political one.
   The officials also insisted that a united Germany remain in the
Western alliance, but Woerner said NATO does not intend to expand
its forces into the current territory of East Germany.
   Thursday's meeting was the first of a series of high-level
discussions that will be capped by a summit of President Bush and
other alliance leaders in London in late June or early July.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Bush wants the
summit to ``launch an in-depth alliance review'' of its political
role, the need for conventional and nuclear forces, and the place
of a broader 35-nation forum in Europe's future.
   ``This will be a very decisive moment in the history of our
alliance _ clearly turning toward the future (and) clearly
adjusting political tasks and military strategy to changed
circumstances,'' Woerner told a news conference.
   The allies are trying to deflect calls for NATO and the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to be scrapped and replaced by the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which draws in
all the nations of Europe, except Albania, plus the United States
and Canada.
   Baker and other ministers insisted that NATO should remain in a
new Europe.
   ``We all agreed, of course, that the alliance will play an
essential role ... in Europe's future,'' said Woerner.
   He said the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
cannot replace NATO. But he said it has ``an important
complementary role to play.''
   The 35 nations met in 1975 in Helsinki, Finland, to set a course
for lessening East-West tensions by promoting human rights and
reducing military friction.
   Since then, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has pressed to
expand the role of the organization, known by its initials as CSCE,
and hold a summit this year.
   The Western nations have agreed to attend a summit in Paris, but
only if negotiators for NATO and the Warsaw Pact strike a deal to
slash troops, tanks and other non-nuclear forces in Europe. They
are trying to get an accord by the fall.
   To prepare for the CSCE summit, Baker offered to host a meeting
of all 35 foreign ministers in New York during the opening session
of the U.N. General Assembly in late September.
   Woerner said the NATO allies want preparations for the CSCE
summit to begin in Vienna in July.
   NATO's defense ministers will meet next week outside Calgary,
Canada, to discuss their nuclear strategy. They will gather again
in late May in Brussels for further talks about military operations.
   In early June, the foreign ministers hold a twice-yearly meeting
in Turnberry, Scotland.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Want Job-Discrimination Bill _ But Not for Themselves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are pushing for faster action on a
bill to combat job discrimination but are making clear the measure
won't apply to what one congressman calls ``the last plantation'' _
Capitol Hill itself.
   The House Education and Labor Committee voted 21-9 on Thursday
against applying provisions of the civil rights bill to
congressional staffers, who have long been exempted from the fair
hiring measures enacted by their bosses.
   ``Some say the last plantation is here on Capitol Hill,'' said
Rep. Charles Hayes, D-Ill., who nevertheless voted with the
majority against extending the bill to cover House employees.
   The bill would overturn six Supreme Court decisions last year
that brought strong protests from civil rights forces.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to fair hiring measures that make it easier for
plaintiffs to win discrimination lawsuits against employers.
   Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, offered the amendment to extend
the measure to House employees. Supporters were mainly Republicans
who are critical of the overall bill, while Democrats who support
the bill opposed Bartlett's plan.
   Bartlett offered his measure as Hayes and other lawmakers called
for faster action on the bill. Chairman Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.,
is hoping for final action by the Education and Labor panel on
Tuesday. The bill then goes to the House Judiciary Committee.
   Members of Congress long have been jealous guardians of their
own patronage powers, and efforts to establish job protection for
Capitol Hill aides generally have been scrapped with little delay.
   Weakening this traditional system could make the bill less
palatable to some lawmakers, and Rep. William Clay, D-Mo.,
suggested that since Bartlett is an outspoken foe of the measure he
might have offered his plan for ``mischievous'' reasons.
   ``I think it's a question of motivation,'' Clay said. ``I doubt
it's the gentleman's intention to modify the bill to the point
where he will cast a vote for it ... If he were sincere, he would
include the Senate in this as well.''
   Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., the panel's ranking Republican,
immediately called on Clay to have his words stricken from the
record, saying questioning another lawmaker's motives violated a
House rule.
   ``I don't think I want to sit in a situation where we are
questioning each other's motives,'' he said. Clay initially refused
to back down, but within a few minutes he asked to have his words
stricken.
   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, praised the idea of
anti-discrimination safeguards for House employees. But he said it
would be wiser to do so with separate legislation that would be
free of the ``frailties'' of current law.
   On the roll call, both Washington and Goodling responded,
``Present.''
   Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., told the lawmakers, however, that
the same tough penalties in current law that affect employers
should also apply to congressmen who discriminate. ``We ought to be
subjected individually to multimillion-dollar lawsuits too,''
Fawell declared.

<TEXT>
   German unity won't be the only thing
on the minds of the four World War II victors when they sit down
Saturday for reunification talks.
   As in Potsdam in 1945 and Paris in 1919, the European balance of
power will be very much at issue. As in those two watershed years,
developments in Germany once again are the reason.
   Foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, France
and Britain will sit with counterparts from both Germanys in a
first attempt to iron out the complex strategic problems posed by
ending Germany's 41-year-old division.
   Saturday's round at the West German Foreign Ministry will likely
be the first of many.
   German unification is the ostensible theme of talks, dubbed
``two-plus-four'' because of the two Germanys and four Allies.
However, the stakes involve all of Europe.
   NATO insists it still has an important role in Europe and wants
a united Germany as a member.
   But the Soviets are worried about the implications of losing
East Germany as their most important military ally, especially
since their influence across Eastern Europe is rapidly waning.
   James A. Baker III, the U.S. secretary of state, said this week
the Soviets should not have a say in whether a united Germany
belongs to the Western military alliance. But Baker said he will
listen to the views of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze when the two meet in Bonn for the two-plus-four talks.
   ``There will be, indeed, a very full and complete discussion of
that issue, because that is one of the foremost issues right now
that separate the alliance from the position of the Soviet Union,''
Baker said.
   The United States and West Germany have offered a solution. A
united Germany would belong to NATO. But Soviet troops would remain
temporarily on East German soil, while NATO troops keep out of that
territory.
   Moscow has rejected that idea, suggesting a compromise that the
West rebuffed: making a united Germany a member of both the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and NATO until alternative security
structures can be set up within Europe.
   Western diplomats worry the Soviets will try to widen the agenda
of the two-plus-four talks to include disarmament matters and to
embrace Moscow's hopes of setting up brand-new security structures
within Europe.
   Broadening the agenda could slow the unification process.
   Both West Germany and the United States have tried to allay
Soviet worries about unification.
   Washington said Thursday it had scrapped plans to modernize
short-range nuclear missiles based in West Germany.
   West Germany has said the Soviet Union's security interests will
be guaranteed. It seems to be offering the Soviets economic
incentives to make up for the loss of East Germany as their biggest
trading partner.
   Conference participants hope to defuse widespread concerns in
Europe that a stronger Germany could again pose a threat to
countries overrun during the two world wars.
   The six nations have already agreed to invite Poland to the
talks when its western border is discussed.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl earlier this year caused a
furor by refusing to guarantee a united Germany would not try to
reclaim land ceded to Poland after World War II.
   Kohl has since reversed himself, but Poland will still be taking
part in the talks at some point to press home its concerns.
   After both world wars, Germany was at the center of
international talks that helped shape the future of Europe.
   In July 1945, the leaders of the United States, Britain and the
Soviet Union met in Potsdam, now in East Germany, and carved up
vanquished Germany.
   In January 1919, 27 nations gathered in Paris to try to make
sure Germany would never again threaten Europe after the carnage of
World War I.
   The result was the Treaty of Versailles, which exacted huge
reparations from Germany and aggravated German bitterness that

<HEAD>Senator Urges Thornburgh to Revamp `Hate Crimes' Hotline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate sponsor of a law to curb ``hate
crimes'' against minority groups is calling on the Justice
Department to expand a newly established hotline to include all
victims of unlawful acts of bigotry.
   ``I firmly believe that the hotline should be open to all those
victimized by hate and prejudice,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said
Thursday in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   He sent his letter as a spokesman for the Justice Department's
community relations service, which operates the hotline, confirmed
that it does not record information concerning crimes involving the
victim's sexual orientation.
   Spokesman Daryl Borgquist, said, however, that the hotline has
not turned away calls from victims of crimes linked to their
religious affiliation.
   ``I have heard that people who have been victimized because of
their sexual orientation or religion have already been told that
the hotline cannot assist them,'' Simon told Thornburgh.
   He said he was troubled by the report and urged Thornburgh to
extend the hotline to handle all of the types of cases that would
be covered under the hate crimes measure signed into law by
President Bush on April 23.
   The hotline was not part of the legislation; establishing it was
an administration initiative.
   Under the law, the government must compile statistics on crimes
of bigotry and publish them along with the annual Uniform Crime
Reports.
   Borgquist said the hotline would not accept information from
homosexuals who were victims of hate crimes because the 1964 Civil
Rights Act that created the community relations service set its
target as problems related to ``race, color or national origin.''
   Sexual preference was not included in the ``mandate'' and thus
the service could not act in the case of hate crimes against them,
he said, recommending that victimized homosexuals notify the FBI.
   An operator who answered the hotline number when it was called
by The Associated Press on Thursday said it did not accept
information about hate crimes based on either sexual preference or
religious affiliation.
   Asked if the hotline would accept information about crimes that
represented clear acts of anti-Semitism, she said that such matters
would not fall within the limits.
   ``It may be that the operator who told you that didn't have as
much training as somebody else,'' Borgquist said. He said the
hotline was being operated on Thursday by employees of the
service's immigration and refugee office and that they had received
less training than those who answered the phones on other days.
   A spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which
notified news organizations of the practice, criticized the Justice
Department for the decision. ``Its an outrage,'' Robert Bray said.
``It amounts to the revictimization of gay people.''
   Bray said his organization had also contacted the offices of
Reps. Gerry Studds and Barney Frank, D-Mass., two openly homosexual
members of Congress, to obtain help in changing the policy.

<HEAD>Barry Invoked Fifth Amendment, Documents Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry invoked his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination when asked whether he had used
drugs in the previous five years, according to court papers.
   Barry, facing a June 4 trial on cocaine possession and perjury
charges, invoked his constitutional right in a letter a year ago to
the U.S. attorney's office.
   The letter followed two appearances by Barry before a federal
grand jury on Jan. 19 and Jan. 24, 1989.
   ``I have been advised by my attorney ... of your desire to pose
a further question to me'' on ``whether I have used within the past
five years any illegal drug,'' said Barry's Jan. 25, 1989, letter.
   ``On advice of counsel, I elect to assert my Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination,'' said the mayor.
   The government released Barry's letter Thursday in opposing the
mayor's motion to suppress Barry's earlier grand jury testimony.
That testimony led to three felony perjury charges, and the mayor
also is accused of five misdemeanor counts of possessing cocaine.
   In his grand jury testimony, Barry asserted that he wasn't aware
of drug use by an associate, Charles Lewis, and that the mayor and
Lewis hadn't given each other cocaine.
   Lewis now is the government's chief witness against Barry.
   A conviction on any of the perjury charges would bar Barry from
holding office or seeking re-election.
   Neither Barry nor his spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, were
immediately available to comment on the documents.
   Meanwhile, the District of Columbia Democratic party defeated a
resolution Thursday night that would have asked Barry not to seek
re-election.
   The proposal, voted down 29-23, declared Barry's leadership ``in
question'' and requested that he ``announce that he will not seek
renomination in 1990.''
   Barry has not publicly disclosed his future political plans.
However, he has made numerous campaign-style appearance since his
return to the city from seven weeks of treatment for substance
abuse. Sources close to the mayor said Barry intends to run for a
fourth four-year term.
   In a letter to Williams, Barry called the resolution
``undemocratic'' because it ``undermines the right of the voter to
decide.''
   Barry also said the party's action ``would have little influence
on my decision about my political future.''

<HEAD>Senate Democrats, Republicans Offer Contrasting Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats and Republicans are laying
out sharply contrasting proposals to change the way their campaigns
are financed, with each party seeking to protect the current
advantages it enjoys.
   Democrats on Thursday unveiled a package to slash in half the
amount of money candidates now raise and spend on campaigns by
imposing ceilings, with a lure that the government would pick up
part of the remaining tab.
   Republicans, claiming it is the source of money rather than the
amount spent that is corrupting politics, had announced a proposal
Tuesday to outlaw political action committees and effectively
prohibit unions from underwriting campaigns.
   Both parties embrace proposals to encourage candidates to rely
more on small contributions of less than $100, $250 or $1,000 from
in-state donors.
   However, critics said the plans leave large loopholes for
raising so-called special interest money through national and state
party organizations.
   The Democratic plan, for example, would outlaw PAC contributions
to individual candidates but still allow the two national parties
to raise up to $5 million from such sources and their House and
Senate campaign committees even more.
   And state party organizations under both plans could still raise
large amounts _ via direct-mail drives and from wealthy individuals
in case of the GOP and, for Democrats, through those sources plus
unions and PACs.
   ``Does it need to be improved? Of course it does,'' said Joan
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a group that advocates
total federal financing of campaigns. ``But to me, it's a giant
step.''
   Under the Democratic plan, about 70 percent of a federal
candidate's general election campaign expenses _ but none of the
costs for primary races _ would be paid by the government from
money raised through a proposed $3 checkoff on income tax returns.
   Through the checkoff, taxpayers could voluntarily designate $3
of the refunds they are due, or add $3 to the taxes they owe, for a
special government account to finance congressional races.
   Since the middle 1970s, tax returns have included a checkoff
that allows taxpayers to designate $1 of their owed taxes to a fund
for financing presidential campaigns.
   The new ceilings that Democrats are proposing on Senate
campaigns are about 20 percent higher than in a previous Democratic
package reported out of the Senate Rules Committee two months ago.
   Covering both primary and general elections, the new limits
would range from $1.9 million in small states to slightly more than
$10 million in the most populous, California.
   ``We're not going to get hung up on the percentages or the
specific amounts,'' said Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the chief
author of the package. ``Everything is negotiable from our point of
view, except that we have to have some limit on overall spending.''
   Republicans reacted with disdain to the proposal. Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, the party's point man on the issue, said the
combination of public financing and campaign ceilings would sharply
curtail the GOP's ability to regain control of Congress.
   ``Including House races, taxpayers would pick up a $400 million
tab each election cycle for an incumbent's protection bill,''
McConnell said. ``Unless you're a sitting governor or a movie star,
no challenger is ever again going to win a political race.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said Democrats embraced a bigger role
for public financing after rejecting it earlier out of a sense of
vulnerability in the wake of recent campaign financing scandals.
   The biggest of those is the ``Keating Five'' senators under
investigation by an ethics panel for interceding with savings and
loan regulators on behalf of Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating
Jr. after accepting $1.3 million in campaign gifts from him.
   ``What we're all willing to trade off is the vulnerability of
having a well-funded legitimate opponent _ because with public
financing, that's a guarantee _ versus the vulnerability of having
our reputations ruined and not being able to defend ourselves,''
Biden said.

<HEAD>State Department Denies Cuban Claim of Potential US Military
Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department calls ``totally false''
Cuba's claim that the United States is planning a large-scale
military attack against the Caribbean nation.
   A dispatch from the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina
from Havana, monitored in Mexico City on Thursday, said Cuba had
mounted large-scale defense measures to repel any U.S. intrusion
into Cuban territory from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo on
Cuba's southeastern coast.
   An effort called ``Operation Shield,'' comprising a squad of
armored cars, a squadron of Soviet-made T-54 tanks, artillery units
and an anti-aircraft unit composed of women, had been deployed in
``an energetic movement of defense forces,'' the report said.
   Reports reaching Washington said Cuba also called up military
reserves, cancelled leaves and launched MiG-29 jet fighters in
response to the opening of U.S. military exercises off the eastern
end of the island near Guantanamo.
   The State Department acknowledged that military exercises are
under way, but described them as ``routine.''
   Cuban claims about the possibility of a U.S. attack on Cuba are
``totally false and appear designed to muster anti-American
sentiment among the Cuban people and to draw attention away from
Cuba's very real internal difficulties,'' said State press officer
Adam Shub.
   Shub said the exercises being carried out are called Ocean
Venture, Global Shield and Defex.
   Ocean Venture is a combined exercise involving the Army, Navy,
Marines and Coast Guard and is a routine readiness drill, he said.
   Global Shield is another readiness training exercise coordinated
through SAC.
   Defex is a routine defense reinforcement-evacuation exercise.
   No additional details were available, but Cuban accounts have
said that Defex involves the evacuation of civilian personnel from
the Guantanamo Base.
   Prensa Latina quoted the Cuban Army as saying there were 18 U.S.
ships at Guantanamo instead of the usual six, including two
tank-landing transports.
   The dispatch said reporters watching through the base fence
could see C-130 transports unloading equipment.
   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some
exercises began last week and would last two weeks, involving seven
warships, Marines, Air Force and Army units, elements of the 82nd
Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., and support elements from
Guantanamo.
   The U.S. Navy has operated from that base for several decades
despite objections from the Cuban government that the American
presence is illegal. Every ship in the Atlantic Fleet is required
to undergo refresher training at the base every three years or
after a major overhaul.
   Cuban officials have been expressing concern for the past
several days about the exercises.

<HEAD>President Cristiani Predicts Direct Talks With Rebels In Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
said the government and leftist rebels, communicating through a
U.N. mediator, will likely hold direct talks in the coming days.
   Cristiani said Thursday that Alvaro de Soto, special envoy of
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez del Cuellar, was working with
the two sides to draft an agenda.
   The Salvadoran president was to meet again today with de Soto,
who is acting under an agreement the two sides reached in Geneva in
April in efforts to end a 10-year-old civil war that has killed an
estimated 72,000 people.
   ``We believe that we can advance rapidly,'' he told reporters at
the presidential offices. ``Once the direct talks are begun this
will become more dynamic.''
   He predicted that face-to-face meetings could begin in a week
and a half.
   De Soto, who arrived Wednesday, met with Cristiani and political
leaders to discuss their positions.
   In a proposal the mediator gave Cristiani on Wednesday, the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas offered to lay
down their weapons and take part in upcoming legislative and
municipal elections if the military gets rid of some of its far
right officers and undertakes political reforms.
   Cristiani warned that if the United States cuts military aid to
El Salvador, he could be forced to seek assistance elsewhere to
make up for the deficit. But he did not say where.
   He said another alternative in the event of an aid cut would be
a reduction in spending for social programs, which would hurt the
poor. He did not give any details.
   A new aid package for El Salvador is being considered on Capitol
Hill. The Bush administration wants $375 million for El Salvador
next year, including $90 million in military aid.
   However, the United States has indicated that continued aid will
be linked to El Salvador's response to the slaying of six Jesuit
priests at Central American University in November.
   A colonel, three lieutenants and five soldiers were charged in
the killings. Cristiani admits the killings were carried out by the
miltary, but critics complain the investigation should reach higher.
   The State Department has said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III would send a congressional report criticizing the Salvadoran
probe of the killings to Cristiani and make it clear that ``the
resolution of this case will be one important element in
determining the nature of future U.S. assistance.''
   El Salvador said Tuesday it hopes the case will go to trial
within 90 days.
   In addition to pressuring the Salvadoran government to make
progress in investigating the Jesuit deaths, the United States has
called for good-faith negotiation with the rebels.

<HEAD>Acting Head of Russian Church Chosen to Replace Deceased Patriarch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elders have chosen the patriarch of the Ukraine to
head the Russian Orthodox Church until a permanent replacement is
decided for the late Patriarch Pimen, the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported today.
   The church's Holy Synod early today chose as Pimen's acting
successor Metropolitan Filaret of the Ukraine.
   Radio Moscow reported today that a permanent patriarch will be
selected within six months by the Local Council, made up of all
metropolitans, archbishops and bishops, as well as representatives
of the clergy and laity.
   Pimen, a pious monk who presided over the church during years of
repression and a recent reawakening, died Thursday at the age of 79
after a long illness.
   Pimen had served as patriarch of the church since 1971, leading
tens of millions of believers under a government that has been
officially atheist since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
   Critics said Pimen was too much under control of the Kremlin,
but his supporters said that he preserved the spiritual integrity
of the church in hard times.
   The new patriarch will face the challenge of rebuilding the
church under relaxed political controls.
   The Soviet parliament sent a telegram, signed by Vice President
Anatoly Lukyanov, expressing condolences to the church over the
loss of Pimen, who over the years had actively backed Kremlin
``peace initiatives'' and arms control proposals.
   Radio Moscow said a funeral was planned Sunday at the Monastery
of the Trinity and St. Sergius in Zagorsk, 45 miles from Moscow.
   Pimen is likely to be remembered as a pious monk who complied
with the will of Soviet authorities before relious tolerance
increased under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who took power
in 1985.
   Pimen appeared to be a devout clergyman who could change with
the times, becoming a cleric during a period of harsh repression
under Josef Stalin, and rising through the church during the
anti-clerical campaigns of Nikita S. Khrushchev and the less
oppressive rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   ``He followed the Khrushchev line on closing churches and never
contradicted any party orders,'' said Alexander Ogorodnikov, a
religious dissident released from prison under Gorbachev.
   ``But at the same time, he was trying all the time to keep
Russian church from declining to heresy,'' said Ogorodnikov.

   British carnivores and vegetarians are chewing
over the scriptures in an argument about whose diet enjoys divine
sanction.
   Britain's agriculture minister, John Selwyn Gummer, started the
flap by declaring that ``the Bible tells us that we are masters of
the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field, and we very
properly eat them.''
   ``If the Almighty had wanted us to have three stomachs (like
cattle), I am sure he could have arranged it, but he chose to make
us omnivores instead,'' Gummer told cheering members of the
International Meat Trade Association, who were gathered Tuesday at
Butchers Hall in London.
   Gummer, a member of the Church of England's governing General
Synod, declared himself fed up with ``deeply undemocratic food
faddists'' who make a religion of their diets.
   The minister's comment provoked a gristly reaction in many
quarters _ starting with his grasp of biology.
   ``For many years I have understood that cattle have four
stomachs,'' Edward Bullen of St. Albans said in a letter in
Friday's editions of The Times.
   Joyce d'Silva, an official for Compassion in World Farming, said
Thursday that Gummer had ignored Genesis 1:29 ``in which that same
Almighty tells man to eat `every herb-bearing seed ... and every
tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
shall be for meat.'''
   Gummer ``was selectively using the Bible. I thought if he could
do it, then we could do it,'' she said.
   Her organization advocates humane slaughter of animals and the
abolition of intensive ``factory farming.''
   Bernard Wetherill, the speaker of the House of Commons, jumped
into the fray Thursday by taking issue with Gummer. He cited Romans
14:19-21 that says, ``For meat destroy not the work of God.''
   For its part, the Vegetarian Society found inspiring reading in
Isaiah _ and none more vivid than the third verse of chapter 66:
``He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth
a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an
oblation, as if he offered swine's blood.''
   Linda Farmer, assistant to the society's manager, also pointed
approvingly to the first chapter of Daniel, in which the prophet
``purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the
portion of the king's meat.''
   After 10 days, it was recorded, Daniel and his companions
``appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which
did eat the portion of the king's meat.''
   A recent poll by The Realeat Co., makers of the ``VegeBurger,''
indicated that 10 percent of those surveyed said they were avoiding
red meat or eating no meat at all.
   ``I want to see more articles about the sensible 90 percent who
are still eating meat,'' Gummer said.
   Tony Gordon, executive director of the International Meat Trade
Association, had no Bible verses to offer. He said Gummer's speech
``was all fairly light-hearted.''
   ``But of course the vegetarians, some of them, have reacted with
horror _ perhaps with less sense of humor than most meat eaters
would have,'' Gordon said Thursday.
   The meat industry is especially unhappy with the Humberside
local council in northeastern England, which has banned beef from
school lunches because of concern about ``mad cow disease.''
   The disease, which attacks the brain, has resulted in the
destruction of more than 11,000 cattle, but the government says
there is no significant danger to humans.
   Jane Brophy, a research officer at the Vegetarian Society,
offered several biblical citations in support of her diet.
   However, Matthew 3:4, which tells of John the Baptist eating
locusts and wild honey, was not among them.
   ``No,'' she said with a laugh, ``we're not recommending that.''

<HEAD>Police Crack Down on Refugee Camp in Hong Kong, Two Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 police firing tear gas raided a
detention camp for Vietnamese refugees today and hauled away about
200 boat people after a week of escape attempts at the overcrowded
compound.
   Several hundred detainees put up barricades of iron rods and
bedding to block police. Authorities in riot gear fired more than
100 canisters of tear gas after some boat people attempted to
attack with homemade weapons, said police spokesman E'man Kwong.
   Two police were the only people injured, he said.
   The crackdown came a day after the top U.N. refugee relief
official in Hong Kong said that Whitehead camp has turned into an
out-of-control ``monster.''
   The official, Robert Van Leeuwen, said overcrowding, combined
with the despair of many detainees who fear they may never
resettle, had helped create the problem.
   About 1,200 police backed by armored vehicles moved in about 5
a.m. today. The helmeted police joined about 300 other security
officers in a search for homemade weapons, which typically consist
of spears, knives and axes made of iron bars.
   They took away the estimated 200 Vietnamese as suspected
troublemakers. Those refugees were transferred to other detention
centers in this British colony for investigation by security
officials, authorities said.
   In addition, 10 Vietnamese were arrested as police searched
Whitehead dormitories for the homemade weapons.
   ``The main purpose (is) to restore law and order in the camp and
boost morale,'' Kwong said. He said it took about an hour to secure
the camp and searched continued throughout the day.
   The search uncovered about 2,500 weapons, Kwong said.
   The camp has been housing more than 22,000 boat people.
   Early Thursday, police fired tear gas into Whitehead to stop an
escape attempt by about 50 Vietnamese.
   On Sunday, about 100 boat people cut through fences and escaped
from the camp.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese boat people are in Hong Kong camps
awaiting resettlement overseas or repatriation to Vietnam.
   Under a policy adopted in 1988 to stem the tide of arriving
Vietnamese, refugees do not qualify for resettlement if they fled
their homeland for economic reasons. The vast majority of detainees
affected by the new law are expected to face forced repatriation to
their Communist homeland.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Inquirer Loses $34 Million Libel Judgment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE OWEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former city prosecutor won a record $34
million libel suit against The Philadelphia Inquirer in a case that
stemmed from newspaper stories written 17 years ago.
   A Common Pleas Court jury on Thursday awarded $2.5 million in
compensatory damages and $31.5 million in punitive damages to
lawyer Richard A. Sprague, a former first assistant district
attorney.
   The decision was the largest award ever against the news media,
surpassing the $28 million won last month by a heart surgeon
against a San Antonio television station.
   The judgment was more than seven times the $4.5 million verdict
that the Inquirer had successfully appealed from the first trial in
the case.
   Sprague sued in 1983 over articles dating to 1973 that
questioned his actions and decisions as a prosecutor.
   His attorney, James E. Beasley, said the jury's verdict sent a
message to investigative reporters ``not to destroy somebody's
reputation.''
   Inquirer executive editor and president Eugene L. Roberts Jr.
said the newspaper would appeal the decision.
   The award amounts to about one-third of the newspaper's net
worth, said the Inquirer's attorney, Samuel E. Klein. Roberts said
the newspaper would be able to stay in business if the judgment
stands, ``but we would be crippled.''
   The Inquirer has won 17 Pulitzer Prizes in the last 16 years,
many of them stemming from investigative stories.
   A libel case observer said Thursday the huge award stood little
chance of surviving an appeals challenge.
   ``Based on the trends, one would have to assume that this award
cannot stand up on appeal,'' said Henry Kaufman, general counsel of
the Libel Defense Resource Center in New York.
   Kaufman said only two libel judgments of more than $1 million
have been affirmed on appeal.
   ``I am a very strong advocate of First Amendment rights,'' said
Beasley. ``What I don't tolerate and I don't think society should
tolerate is the use of investigative reporters or the power of the
press for a personal vendetta. And that is what developed here.''
   He said Greg Walter, one of the reporters involved in the
stories, had threatened to ``get and destroy'' Sprague, who had
prosecuted Walter in 1972 for taping a conversation without the
other person's knowledge.
   Walter has since died.
   Roberts, the newspaper's president, complained that the judge
eliminated 13 witnesses who would have helped the paper's case, and
rejected an investigative report by a former state attorney general
that supported the Inquirer story.
   ``I am confident that however long it takes, the Inquirer will
prevail,'' said Roberts. ``Most of our case never got to the jury.''
   Judge Charles P. Mirarchi Jr. Mirarchi said Sprague required a
``preponderance of evidence'' to prove statements defamed him and
had to meet the tougher standard of ``clear and convincing
evidence'' to prove falsity, actual malice and damages.
   Sprague sued over articles that he said implied he was involved
in an illegal wiretapping incident, an allegation he denied, and
questioned his role in a homicide case involving a son of a friend,
former state police commissioner Rocco Urella.
   An eight-week trial resulted in the verdict for Sprague in 1983.
   The state Supreme Court in June 1988 ordered a new trial,
declaring reporters have an absolute right to invoke the state
Shield Law in refusing to identify confidential sources during
legal proceedings.
   In the original trial, Judge Charles A. Lord ruled the law did
not apply in the case and excluded all testimony about information
from unidentified sources.

   Eight years ago this village of 250
families in the foothills of the Berkshires had its own baby boom
when 29 women gave birth, two to twins, and three others adopted
children.
   Now the youngsters are in school and townsfolk are struggling to
come up with the money to educate them.
   ``It was the first time in the history of the town that goes
back over 200 years that there had been so many babies,'' said
Karen Barshefski, the town's Parent Teacher Organization president,
who was one of the new mothers in 1982. ``Yankee Magazine even came
out and took our picture.''
   ``We have a tax (limit) override vote on Saturday and I can't
even think about what we will do if that doesn't pass,'' said
Selectwoman Julia Sharron, who doubles as town librarian.
   School costs, up more than $130,000 over last year, make up
nearly one-third of the town's $1.7 million proposed budget, she
said, and the state has cut back on its help to schools and towns
as its own money problems have worsened.
   Mrs. Barshefski has spent the past several Saturdays with other
mothers campaigning for the override, but she's pessimistic about
the outcome.
   ``We rely a lot on volunteer help like most small towns and we
have cut back as much as we can, even when it comes to keeping up
the roads,'' Mrs. Sharron said. ``But the kids have to get an
education. The most important thing anyone can give a child is
education.''
   The baby boom has overwhelmed the community's five-room school,
with 92 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. Last year
residents remodeled the basement and moved the kindergarten and the
library there to make room for a second first-grade class.
   And as Worthington's enrollment zoomed _ by nearly one-third in
the last five years _ it was also called on to finance a larger
share of the regional school district's budget that encompasses
seven towns, said Duane Wynan, assistant superintendent. The
regional school system's costs are split among the towns, based on
the number of schoolchildren who attend from each town.
   Worthington's baby boom came just about the same time the
state's voters approved Proposition 2{, which limits communities to
raising tax levies 2.5 percent annually until they reach 2.5
percent of assessed valuation. And like many small towns with small
budgets, Worthington soon felt the pinch.
   Over the past several years, its 1,200 residents have approved
three overrides of the tax limit. Saturday's vote would add $12.50
to the $89.60 bill of a homeowner with a house assessed at $100,000.

   The church doesn't like it but never mind,
street vendors are everywhere in the capital hawking T-shirts and
medallions, comic books and posters for the upcoming visit of Pope
John Paul II.
   He arrives Sunday for an eight-day visit.
   The Roman Catholic Church had asked that Mexicans not
commercialize the pope's second visit to this country, but the
papal image is showing up on key rings and beachwear anyway.
   Salesmen blare recordings of hastily-written pope songs over
portable tape players to advertise their wares.
   Vendors around the capital's Guadalupe Basilica, Mexico's
holiest shrine where the pope will visit, are to be moved out
today, officials said.
   On Mexico City's Reforma, one of two main streets bisecting the
capital, a T-shirt vendor displays an item welcoming the pope
between two others proclaiming in large type, ``I Got Drunk in
Mexico.''
   Cardinal Ernesto Corripio Ahumada, the head of the church in
Mexico, says people are selling bogus tickets that supposedly admit
the bearer to religious events where the pope will be.
   ``Not only the Vatican but the Episcopal Conference of Mexico
has insisted that this visit not be commercialized, Corripio said.
   Newspaper ads offer gold and silver coins with the pope's image,
which also can be found on porcelain plates, plastic bottles and
candy.
   ``Nearly a million street vendors and a similar number of
establishments and commercial centers have transformed in recent
weeks faith into fanaticism,'' said the government newspaper El
Nacional.
   The pope trade also is brisk in the provinces he will visit.

<HEAD>Three Former Lawmen Convicted of Murding Black Inmate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TYLER, Texas _ Prosecutors said they would seek life prison
terms for three white former guards convicted of beating a black
prisoner to death on Christmas Day 1987.
   An all-white jury was to begin hearing testimony today to decide
sentencing for former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner and
former Sabine County sheriff's deputies Billy Ray Horton and James
M. Hyden.
   The same jury found the men guilty Thursday of murdering Loyal
Garner Jr. on Dec. 27, 1987.
   The three men face terms of 5 to 99 years. In Texas, the
sentencing phase of a trial can take days.
   ``There's no question that justice was done in this case for
Loyal Garner Jr. and for his family,'' Smith County District
Attorney Jack Skeen said.
   Garner, a 34-year-old father of six from Florien, La., died of
severe head injuries after his arrest on drunken driving charges
two days earlier.
   Garner's widow, Corrinne Garner, cried quietly as the verdict
was announced. His mother, Sarah Garner said, ``I'm glad. I hope
it's over.''
   The verdict caught many by surprise. The three were acquitted in
July 1988 of having violated Garner's civil rights. While that case
was pending, the men were indicted on murder charges.
   Defense attorneys tried to stop the murder trial, contending the
charges constituted double jeopardy.
   A federal judge last month ordered the trial to proceed.
   Defense attorneys promised an appeal.
   ``It's double jeopardy. They tried them exactly twice for
exactly the same crime,'' said John Seale, Ladner's attorney.
   Former U.S. Attorney John Hannah, who was special prosecutor in
the civil rights trial, said he was not surprised by the verdict.
   ``I thought with a fair judge and an impartial jury and a
competent prosecutor that it was a foregone conclusion,'' he said.
   ``There wasn't a day come that I didn't look up to heaven and
talk to God about it,'' Garner's mother said.

<HEAD>Hostage Reed Reportedly Beaten During Escape Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During 42 months of captivity, Frank Reed endured
the psychological pain of being told his mother had died and the
physical pain of being badly beaten when he tried to escape, his
daughter said.
   It was only after he was released Monday that Reed learned his
mother was still alive, his daughter, Marilyn Langston, said
Thursday. The wounds from his beating still ache, she said.
   Reed, 57, was scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base
today and spend a few more days undergoing tests at a military
hospital before continuing home to Massachusetts, a U.S. State
Department spokeswoman said.
   In a telephone conversation early Wednesday, Reed said his
Islamic captors told him his mother, 91-year-old Leota Sprague, had
died, Langston said said.
   ``He was told she had passed away,'' Langston said in a
telephone interview from her home in Malden. ``He didn't know she
was alive until he was released. We were able to tell him she was
very much alive.''
   Reed's mother shares an apartment in Malden with Reed's wife,
Fahima, and the couple's 9-year-old son, Tarek.
   Langston said she would fly to Washington today to meet her
father.
   In a telephone call early Wednesday, Reed told Langston he had
tried to escape his captors but was quickly caught and badly beaten
for the attempt.
   ``He told me he'd been beaten. He did try to escape and they'd
beaten him very badly,'' Langston said.
   On Wednesday evening, Langston tied a yellow ribbon around a
tree in front of her home. On the house she hung a large banner
reading, ``Free at last, Frank Reed, April 30, 1990.''
   She said Reed was denied medical attention for his wounds and is
still recovering from them. Reed said he had tried to escape alone,
but it was unclear when during his captivity he had made the
attempt, she said.
   Langston said she had previously heard of the beating in news
reports from the French hostages who had been released in 1988.
   Reed expressed concern about what he would do following his
return to the United States, she said.
   ``He's concerned about what will happen now,'' she said. ``He
feels his school is gone, and he's wondering about the future.''
   The founder of a private school in Beirut, Reed was abducted on
Sept. 9, 1986 and spent 3{ years in captivity.
   He was the second American hostage to be freed in nine days.
Robert Polhill, freed April 22, went through the same battery of
medical tests and questioning last week that Reed is currently
undergoing.
   In his first public statement since his release Monday, Reed
told reporters outside a military hospital in West Germany that he
had believed he was the last hostage to be released and he was
angry that other Americans are still being held.
   Reed, a native of Malden, said he spent several years in
captivity with hostages Terry Anderson, Thomas Sutherland, John
McCarthy and Brian Keenan.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted on a Beirut street in March 1985. He is the
longest-held hostage.

<HEAD>Calls For Patriotism On Anniversary Of Democracy Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today marked the 71st anniversary of its
first democracy movement, criticizing last May's pro-reform rallies
and appealing to young people to devote themselves to communism.
   The Communist Youth League and other official groups organized
functions to commemorate the ``May 4th Movement,'' but there were
no reports of unauthorized student activities.
   Last year, on the 70th anniversary of the movement, about
100,000 students and supporters surged into Tiananmen Square for a
peaceful rally seeking greater freedom, an end to official
corruption and a free press.
   The demonstration was one of the high points of the seven-week
democracy movement that ended on June 4 when the military stormed
Beijing and seized Tiananmen from the students who had occupied it.
   The government has since suppressed any further student unrest
through a harsh campaign of ideological education and intimidation.
   The party's official People's Daily, in a front-page editorial
today, said the message to be learned from the ``May 4th Movement''
is that ``the spirit of patriotism is to be devoted to the cause of
socialism and the socialist modernization of the motherland.''
   In an indirect reference to last year's student demands for
rapid democratic reform, it noted that ``in a greenhouse, you
cannot grow trees which reach to the sky.''
   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, in a speech to about 3,000
invited youths Thursday, also stressed that last year's student
movement was different from that of May 4, 1919.
   In 1919, several thousand college students gathered at Tiananmen
Gate to demand democracy and modernization. Their protest sparked
an intellectual movement that included the creation and expansion
of the Communist Party.
   Jiang said the 1919 campaign was a ``great anti-imperialism and
anti-feudalism movement'' whereas student activists in 1989 ``bound
themselves with foreign hostile forces and conducted activities
harmful to the motherland.''
   Officially organized events today included the start of a youth
festival and Communist Youth League-sponsored entertainment at a
park adjacent to the Forbidden City.
   Invited youths watched fashion shows, hair styling, singing and
band performances. There were booths selling clothing and food and
a hall for dancing.
   Tiananmen Square was open to the public, but large numbers of
police patrolled the square and its environs.
   What became known as the May 4th Movement began as a protest of
the Versailles Treaty that ended World War I. China's warlord
government agreed to treaty clauses that endorsed Japan's seizure
of parts of China during the war.
   Although the treaty was the immediate spark that caused the
protest, the main slogans of the students were democracy and
science, by which they meant modernization. The government now is
choosing to eliminate the democracy angle and stress the
anti-imperialism and science aspects of the movement.

   Rain was scattered across broad sections of the eastern half of
the nation today but much of the West was fair.
   Flooding continued Thursday in north-central Texas, which has
recorded its wettest spring since 1922. Hundreds of people were
forced from their homes in Texas, southern Oklahoma and northwest
Arkansas.
   Among the spots reporting serious flooding were the Trinity
River in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the Sabine river in east
Texas, the Blue River in southern Oklahoma and the Red River along
the Texas-Oklahoma line.
   A flash flood watch was posted for all of Arkansas except the
extreme southeast portions. The western part of the state had as
much as 10 inches of rain in the past two days.
   West Tennessee also was under a flash flood watch for an area
between the Mississippi River and the Tennessee River, which
includes Memphis.
   Thunderstorms were widespread Thursday afternoon in eastern
Texas and western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms also were scattered
across Indiana and Kentucky.
   Snow moved out of Colorado but was falling in northwest Kansas.
   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered Thursday across east
central Wyoming, large sections of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
eastern Texas and into the Deep South and Midwest.
   Rain also was scattered across the Northeast early today. Fair
weather prevailed on the West Coast, in the desert Southwest and in
the Northwest.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 98 degrees at
two California locations, Borrego Springs and Palm Springs.

   Parliament today elected elder statesman
Constantine Caramanlis as the fifth head of state since democracy
was restored in 1974 after a military dictatorship.
   Caramanlis, 83, a six-time prime minister and former president,
won 153 votes of the 299 cast.
   He needed a simple majority in the 300-member Parliament to be
elected to a five-year term in the largely ceremonial post of
president. In the first round of voting Monday, he fell short of
the required 180 votes.
   Caramanlis returns to the post which he established and held
from 1980 to 1985. He was backed chiefly by the governing
conservative party's 150 deputies.
   The socialists and the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and
Progress did not support Caramanlis, who founded the governing New
Democracy party in 1974.
   Prime Minister Constantine Mitstotakis expressed satisfaction
with Caramanlis's election.
   ``With the great respect he enjoys both at home and abroad,
Caramanlis will help the country at this time of crisis,'' said
Mitsotakis after the voting.
   The conservative government recently announced a series of
economic austerity measures in a bid to cope with high inflation
and rising deficits.
   Caramanlis was Greece's first prime minister after a 1967-74
military dictatorship, overseeing the return to democracy and
establishing the presidency after holding a referendum that
abolished the monarchy.
   He became the republic's third president in 1980, resigning in
1985 shortly after the socialist government at the time reneged on
a promise to support his bid for re-election.

<HEAD>Johnson &amp; Johnson Heir Dead at Age 63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stage and screen producer Mary Lea Johnson
Richards, who with her siblings contested the will of their father,
Johnson &amp; Johnson heir J. Seward Johnson, has died at age 63.
   Ms. Johnson died Thursday at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh, where she recently underwent a liver transplant,
hospital spokesman Frank Raczkiewicz said.
   Ms. Johnson, who used her maiden name, lived in New York.
   She and her husband, Martin Richards, formed The Producer Circle
Co. in 1976 with Robert Fryer and James Cresson.
   The company's stage shows won 22 Tony Awards and a Pulitzer
Prize and included ``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Crimes of the Heart,'' ``La
Cage Aux Folles'' and ``Foxfire.'' Their films included ``The Boys
From Brazil,'' ``The Shining,'' and ``Fort Apache, the Bronx.''
   Ms. Johnson was born in New Brunswick, N.J., the eldest of six
children of the heir to the pharmaceutical fortune.
   In a bitter, three-year court battle, she and her siblings
contested the will in which their father left nearly his entire
estate to his third wife, Polish-born Barbara Piasecka-Johnson.
   The children also claimed their father was not mentally
competent when he signed the will in 1983, a few weeks before his
death at age 87.
   J. Seward Johnson had said he cut his children out of his will
``not for any lack of affection'' but because he set up
multimillion dollar trust funds for them in 1944.
   A day before the case was to go to a jury in 1986, the children
agreed to a settlement that gave them a total $42.5 million, plus
$20 million to the Harbor Branch Foundation, a Florida
oceanographic institute founded by their father. Barbara
Piasecka-Johnson got $300 million in the settlement.
   Piasecka-Johnson last year offered to invest $100 million in the
Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, where the Solidarity trade union
was born. That deal has failed to move forward, however.
   Besides her husband, Mary Lea Johnson is survived by her
siblings, J. Seward Johnson Jr., Elaine Wold, Diana Firestone,
James Johnson and Jennifer Johnson Duke; six children, Eric,
Seward, Roderick, Hillary, Alice and Quentin; and nine
grandchildren.

   Trouble starts with a capital `T' and that
rhymes with `C' and that stands for Coyote. As in Coyote Cafe.
   So when police chief Gene Shaw caught wind that the cafe was
going to open this summer, the news rubbed him the wrong way.
   When the restaurant's owners applied for a liquor license, Shaw
asked the New York State Liquor Authority not to grant one.
   A coyote is a ``varmint,'' he said. ``The name coyote is
synonymous with trouble.''
   Stephanie Kanellos, an owner of the cafe, said she was angered
by the chief's action, but agreed to change the name to Cactus
Cafe. Shaw withdrew his objection to the liquor license after that.

   The Lawrence County Council is going to
jail, but only for a visit.
   The three commissioners plan to try out a new $5 million county
jail May 29. The jail is nearing completion in downtown Bedford.
   ``Since the council represents the voters of Lawrence County and
is spending that kind of money I think we should make sure we are
receiving ultimate value for that $5 million,'' said Council
President Jack Cummings.
   The 80-cell jail also includes the sheriff's new offices and new
county court facilities.
   Sheriff Jerry Ross said his wife, Charlotte, who is the jail
chief matron, will get a chance to try out kitchen equipment when
she prepares breakfast for the council.
   ``I think it's a good idea,'' the sheriff said. ``It will give
the elected officials an idea of what it takes to operate that jail
and maybe they will get an idea on how much help it's going to take
and maybe we can find some of the bugs before we put the inmates in
it.''

<HEAD>Soviet Soccer Fans Riot After Uzbek Game is Canceled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soccer fans in a Central Asian city rioted when a
game was canceled, looting and setting fire to scores of buildings,
official media said today. At least 44 people were reported injured.
   The independent news service Post Factum claimed an intoxicated
mob killed the director of the soccer stadium and burned the
structure down in the violence Wednesday. But the other reports did
not confirm that.
   However, the reports said the fans, many intoxicated, looted and
set fires across Andizhan, a city in the Fergana Valley of eastern
Uzbekistan.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed because
communications with Andizhan were cut.
   The area is plagued with severe unemployment, with 80,000
jobless among the Andizhan region's population of 1.6 million.
   Last summer, more than 100 people were killed in ethnic clashes
between Uzbeks and another Turkish ethnic group, the Meskhetians,
in the nearby city of Fergana.
   The soccer rioters attacked the Andizhan regional Communist
Party headquarters and the city prosecutor's office, as well as 125
other buildings, 79 stores and 36 homes, the official Tass news
agency reported.
   They set fire to 13 stores, 46 workshops and dozens of homes.
They also destroyed 18 institutions, including libraries, reported
Pravda, the newspaper of the Communist Party.
   Interior Ministry troops restored order, the reports said.
   The violence began when 10,000 fans waiting in mid-afternoon
heat were told a visiting team from the Uzbekistan republic's
capital of Tashkent had failed to show up for a game, Pravda said.
   When officials announced the game was canceled, the crowd began
to throw rocks and beat the chairman of the soccer club, the
newspaper said. Fans set fire to two police cars and an automobile
that was to be a door prize, Pravda said.
   The injured included 13 Interior Ministry troops, 10 policemen
and 11 civilians, Tass said.
   In its report, Post Factum said the crowd, armed with automatic
weapons, rampaged through neighborhoods of Russians, Armenians and
Jews, leaving the Armenian quarter smoldering.
   The news service also quoted an unidentified member of the
visiting team as saying the game was canceled not because the team
failed to appear, but because the attacks were planned.

<HEAD>Sanitation Show Boasts Spiffy New Garbage Trucks, Jewelry for
Garbagemen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a gathering of garbagemen, models in cocktail
dresses circled spiffy white garbage trucks, while tie-dyed
salespeople hawked jewelry for sanitation workers.
   Last month's Earth Day has Americans excited about a mundane
task _ throwing out the trash. And it was easy to see at Waste Expo
'90 that garbage is not only chic, but good business.
   The annual convention of the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, drew more than 10,000 people this week to the Georgia
World Congress Center. They attended seminars like ``Women in
Waste'' and ``Backyard Basics: How Composting Can Improve Your
Bottom Line.''
   They looked over the latest gee-gaws for their industry, from
the Cram-A-Lot Compactor Sentry System to computer software to
recycler-friendly garbage trucks.
   Amid all the glitz and glamour you never associated with
garbage, there was a common theme: Recycling is a good idea, and a
good business.
   ``If we have another Earth Day, everybody's going to be doing
this,'' said Jerry Andregg as he stood next to a fancy white
garbage truck with four compartments for four separate kinds of
garbage and a plastic masher in the middle.
   ``It's helped our business out,'' he said, ``it'' being Earth
Day. ``And it's raised people's awareness _ how important it is to
start recycling.''
   You know those big buckets that school-cafeteria mayonnaise come
in? Well, with color-coding, a hole for rainwater to drain out of
and a snazzy logo on the front, a company called Plastican makes
them into bins for household recyclables.
   ``Everyone wants to do it,'' said Plastican's Doug McGee, ``it''
being recycling. ``But everyone's trying to figure out how to do
it.''
   That's what Thomas Higgins figures. He brought with him plenty
of clear _ rather than colored _ plastic garbage bags.
   ``The most effective way to run a curbside recycling program is
to pick up the material in a clear bag,'' said Higgins, manager of
Hefty Recycling Opportunities for the Mobil Chemical Co.'s Consumer
Products Division.
   The idea, he said, is that homeowners don't want 17 recycling
bins cluttering up the garage, and cities don't want to pay the
garbageman to dawdle at the curb, putting the brown beer bottles in
one place, the clear juice bottles in another place and the
newspapers in a third place.
   The answer: clear garbage bags.
   Over at the Dempster display, John L. Thomas, vice president for
sales, showed off a gleaming white garbage truck with a
side-loading window-box gizmo that dumps different kinds of garbage
in the correct place in the truck.
   ``Earth Day has really brought it into focus,'' Thomas said.
``This (recycling) is the answer to our disposables problem.
   ``So many of our landfills are filling up. We're running out of
landfill space. One way to extend landfill life is to put less in
them,'' he said.
   ``We're the only company with 14-karat jewelry for sanitation,
from $115 to $5,000 _ in stock!'' said Jimmy Brett, who's hawking
stuff while his brother Saul was back in New York, minding the
store.
   Saul Brett Inc. makes gold-colored garbage-can tie tacks and
gold-and-diamond garbage-truck pins for the valued sanitation
employee, or the supportive sanitation spouse.
   ``No one,'' Brett says, ``does it like we do.''

<HEAD>CDC: Drug-Resistant Strains of Gonorrhea Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Penicillin-resistant gonorrhea more than doubled
from 1988 to 1989 and its treatment will require more expensive
drugs, federal researchers say.
   A survey of 21 clinics that treat sexually transmitted disease
found penicillin-resistant gonorrhea increased 131 percent in the
one-year period, the national Centers for Disease Control said
Thursday.
   Tetracycline-resistant gonorrhea increased by 23 percent in the
same period, the survey found.
   During the study period, the national gonorrhea rate of
infection remained basically unchanged, with three cases reported
in every 1,000 Americans.
   ``The traditional _ and admittedly inexpensive _ therapies for
gonorrhea, penicillin and tetracycline, really in many situations
are not going to be the appropriate drugs for treating gonorrhea in
1990,'' said William Whittington, a CDC specialist in sexually
transmitted diseases.
   The CDC survey found gonorrhea strains susceptible to two
typically more expensive drugs, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin.
   Ceftriaxone or similar treatment ``remains an integral component
of the strategy for gonorrhea control,'' the CDC said.
   In the survey, 20 male gonorrhea patients were tested each month
for drug resistance.
   Resistance to penicillin, which occurred in 3.2 percent of the
study cases in 1988, increased to 7.4 percent in 1989, the CDC said.
   Resistance to tetracycline, which occurred in 4 percent of the
study cases in 1988, increased to 4.9 percent in 1989, the CDC said.
   ``Significant'' increases in penicillin resistance were reported
at seven clinics: Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Boston; Long Beach,
Calif.; Philadelphia; San Antonio and San Diego.
Penicillin-resistant cases made up 32 percent of the cases in the
Long Beach clinic last year.
   Significant increases in tetracycline resistance were reported
in Birmingham, Denver, St. Louis and West Palm Beach, Fla., while
decreases were observed in Atlanta and Baltimore. The highest rate
of tetracycline resistance last year, 20 percent, was in
Philadelphia.
   Nationwide, 738,160 cases of gonorrhea were reported last year.
So far this year, 215,011 cases have been reported, down slightly
from 216,088 at the same point in 1989.

<HEAD>Korean Police Raid Hospital Morgue To Seize Worker's Body</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clamping down further after a week of
labor unrest, police raided a hospital morgue early today to seize
an activist's body from militant workers, news reports said.
   Police arrested 149 of the workers in the action in Changwon,
about 210 miles south of Seoul, the reports said.
   Authorities said they mounted the raid at the request of the
dead worker's family, who they said opposed a large funeral planned
by the militant workers. The worker killed himself Thursday.
   Meanwhile, Hyundai company officials in Seoul said about half
the 100,000 workers at their 13 subsidiaries in the city of Ulsan
were back to work today. Police on Saturday stormed the company
shipyard to drive out workers on a three-day occupation strike.
   Hyundai officials said they expected further improvement after
27,000 workers of the Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest
automaker, today voted to return to work Monday. The vote ended a
week of nationwide sympathy strikes protesting the raid on the
nearby Hyundai shipyard.
   In today's action, about 600 riot police charged into the
hospital in the southern industrial town of Changwon before dawn,
took the body of the dead worker and returned it to his family for
burial, news reports said.
   The national news agency, Yonhap, said about 200 militant
workers guarding the morgue were overpowered by police wielding
clubs and shields.
   The shipyard strike in Ulsan, about 200 miles southeast of
Seoul, has revolved around workers' demands for the release of four
previously jailed union leaders.
   Officials feared the death of the labor activist, 28-year-old
Kim Young-il, might be used to stir up more trouble.
   Kim, a labor activist at the Tongil Industry Co. in Changwon,
leaped to his death from a two-story building at his plant Thursday
after dousing himself with paint thinner and setting it ablaze.
   Yonhap said he left letters complaining of a hard life and
protesting police suppression of labor activity.
   Hyundai officials said the Ulsan shipyard, the largest in the
world, will be open Monday if workers holed up at the top of an
240-foot crane come down. The workers took refuge there during
Saturday's raid.
   Fifteen workers, saying they were sick, came down today and were
arrested by police. News reports said 50 to 250 workers remain on
the crane.

<HEAD>Driftnet Fishing Boats Spotted Bearing North Korean Flags</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five driftnet fishing boats spotted in
unauthorized areas are marked with North Korean flags, which would
signal a new player in an international fray over use of such nets
and high seas salmon fishing, authorities said.
   North Korea has no diplomatic ties or fisheries treaties with
the United States.
   ``We're trying to establish whether they are in fact North
Korean and if they are North Korean, why they have suddenly
appeared out there this year,'' said Coast Guard Capt. David A.
Wirth, in Juneau.
   ``We have never seen them before,'' he said. ``We don't know why
they're there.''
   The Coast Guard is tracking the ships with aircraft, Wirth said.
   The ships were spotted Tuesday by a Coast Guard plane, officials
said Thursday. They were fishing about 400 miles southwest of Kiska
Island near the end of the Aleutian chain, in waters where
driftnets likely would intercept salmon from North America.
   While most driftnets ostensibly are set for squid, critics say
they illegally snag millions of dollars worth of U.S. and Canadian
salmon. The critics liken the floating nets, stretching as long as
30 miles, to strip-mining of the sea.
   The ships flew North Korean flags and had North Korean markings
on their smokestacks and bows, Coast Guard officials said Thursday.
   Four similar ships were spotted in the same area April 22 and
24, the Coast Guard said.
   It's possible the North Korean insignia is a disguise by vessels
from other nations that could be pirating salmon in violation of
agreements with the United States, Wirth said. Or the ships may be
North Korean on contract with other nations, he said.
   The United States has negotiated treaties with South Korea,
Japan and Taiwan prohibiting the taking of North American salmon by
driftnets. It has a tentative agreement with the Soviet Union to
cooperate to stop illegal salmon fishing in the North Pacific. U.S.
officials have asked the Soviet Union for help in investigating the
ships.
   ``Our government called in the Soviet fisheries attache
(Wednesday) and requested assistance,'' said Bill Woolf, fisheries
aide to U.S. Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska.
   ``We hope the Soviets will do their best to dissuade the North
Koreans _ if indeed these ships are theirs _ from high seas salmon
fishing, at best, and at the very least to assist us in gathering
information on the extent and duration of this fishery, and if they
have information on where the product is going,'' Woolf said.
   Coast Guard photographs show the five ships ``appear to be new
and are very well kept up, with gobs and gobs of sophisticated
electronics,'' Woolf said.
   ``They're not typical of the usual Japanese and Taiwanese
driftnet fishing vessels, which see some pretty rough usage,'' he
said.
   Photographs also show fish on the ships' decks.
   The ships may be violating the 1976 Magnuson Act, which in part
protects fish spawned in U.S. rivers, said Henry Mitchell,
executive director of the Bering Sea Fishermen's Association in
Anchorage.
   ``U.S. law says our fish, spawned in U.S. rivers, are under our
protection when they are out at sea,'' Mitchell said.

   A killer who described himself and his
girlfriend as a ``modern-day Bonnie and Clyde'' was executed in
Florida's electric chair today for shooting two officers 14 years
ago.
   Jessie Joseph Tafero was electrocuted at 7:13 a.m. at Florida
State Prison, eight hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
stay of execution, exhausting his last appeal, the governor's
office announced.
   Tafero, 43, was the 22nd person put to death in Florida since
1979 and the 124th to die in the United States since the Supreme
Court restored states' rights to execute prisoners in 1976. It was
a year to the day since Florida's previous execution.
   In a final statement, Tafero complained that last-minute motions
filed on his behalf this morning with a federal judge and a state
Circuit Court judge apparently were ignored.
   ``I'd like to say that the death penalty as applied by the
states is very arbitrary and capricious,'' he said.
   The executioner interrupted the standard two-minute, 2,000-volt
electrical cycle because of the smoke and flames when a wet sponge
on Tafero's head caught fire, said state Corrections Department
spokesman Bob Macmaster.
   But he said the prison's chief medical officer, Dr. Frank Kilgo,
believed Tafero died quickly.
   Fewer than a dozen death penalty opponents demonstrated in
silence with a candlelight vigil in a pasture outside the rural
prison. Their posters said ``Kinder, Gentler?'' and
``Civilization's Finest Hour?''
   Four supporters of the death penalty peered through heavy fog,
watching the prison for a signal from departing reporters that
Tafero was dead.
   Tafero's day began with a Mass at 1 a.m. celebrated by a Roman
Catholic priest from the Cathedral of St. Augustine. He also was
visited during the night by five attorneys and his mother, Kathleen
Tafero, said Macmaster.
   He described Tafero as ``quiet ... a little concerned about the
event, of course.''
   The killings occurred Feb. 20, 1976, when a state trooper and a
visiting Canadian constable checked on a car parked on the highway
where Tafero, his girlfriend Sonja Jacobs, her two children and
traveling companion Walter Rhodes Jr., were sleeping.
   Trooper Phillip Black died from gunshot wounds to the head and
neck, while constable Donald Irwin of Kitchener, Ontario, received
fatal wounds to his right eye and shoulder. Both men were 39.
   Tafero, Ms. Jacobs and Rhodes were convicted on murder charges.
Rhodes got three concurrent life terms, while Tafero and Ms. Jacobs
were sentenced to death. Ms. Jacobs' sentence was commuted to life
in prison in 1981.
   A letter in Tafero's file describes the reaction of Black's
young son, Christian, when he learned at school that his father had
been killed.
   ``His grief was so strong, so unresolved and so overwhelming for
this little boy, that none of us knew how to help him,'' wrote
elementary school teacher Claudia R. Jacobowitz.
   An only child, Tafero was born in Jersey City, N.J., and moved
to Dade County at the age of 10. His father was a comedian and car
salesman and his mother was a housewife.
   Court records show a considerable juvenile record beginning at
age 13. He quit school at age 16 after the ninth grade. In 1967, he
was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, breaking and
entering and robbery. He spent six years in prison.
   In a 1984 interview, Tafero said his arrest and sentencing with
Ms. Jacobs made them feel like ``modern day Bonnie and Clyde.''
   The couple had an infant daughter, Cristina Tafero, at the time
of the shootings. She lives in New York with guardians and recently
visited Tafero in prison.
   The Supreme Court voted 7-2 not to stay the execution. Justices
William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose the death
penalty, dissented.
   Earlier Thursday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta turned down Tafero's request for a stay, after U.S.
District Judge Lenore Nesbitt in Miami refused to issue a writ of
habeas corpus in the case.
   Executions have been a hot political issue in this gubernatorial
reelection year. Gov. Bob Martinez's political advertisements
stress that he has signed 122 death warrants since taking office,
and 26 this year.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany should not give its currency to
relatively rich East Germans without investigating whether their
wealth came from crooked dealings by the old Communist regime, a
West German politician said today.
   Otto Graf Lambsdorff said higher bank accounts should be
investigated before the East German marks are ``automatically
exchanged'' for West German marks as part of an economic merger
that is to go into effect on July 2.
   Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrat Party that is the junior
governing partner in the government of West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, made his comments to reporters in West Berlin.
   Teams of experts from both countries resumed talks in East
Berlin today on the logistics of merging their economies,
particularly with finding a way to convert East Germany's
state-owned land and enterprises to the private sector.
   Under an agreement reached earlier between the nations, most
East German savings accounts of up to 4,000 marks will be traded at
a 1-1 rate for West German marks. Most accounts higher than that
will be traded at a 2-1 rate.
   Lambsdorff said a ceiling, which he did not specify, should be
set for larger accounts. He said these should be investigated to
make sure they were ``honestly acquired'' and not amassed illegally
by, for example, members of the now-disbanded secret police.
   Members of the feared secret police and officials of the former
regime of ousted hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker are
believed to have large holdings in East German currency.
   Lambsdorff also repeated comments made by several West German
officials on Thursday that East Germany must quickly convert its
public property to the private sector.
   Virtually all enterprises and land are owned by the state under
the socialist system now being phased out after four decades in
power.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said Thursday
that private ownership of property and industry was crucial to
creating a market economy that would spawn the jobs and income
necessary to offset the loss of huge social subsidies.
   He said many details have to be worked out, but that private
ownership is needed to cope with the widespread joblessness
expected in East Germany as the country is forced to compete in the
free market.
   ``From July onwards every company that's active in West Germany
can also become active in East Germany,'' Haussmann said in Bonn,
the West German capital.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said he wanted an
``appropriate legal basis'' established for the purchase of land,
enterprises and government-run media by foreign concerns.
   He said Thursday he would block the ``uncontrolled'' acquisition
of such government-owned assets by West Germans and foreigners.
   The latest unification talks follow the agreement on conversion
rates for changing East German marks to West German marks.
   Social Democrats in the government of de Maiziere, who leads the
conservative Christian Democrats, sharply criticized the plan.
   East German Finance Minister Walter Romberg said the agreement
still does not give adequate protection to people earning low
incomes and fails to include a mechanism to protect people when
rents and livings costs rise in the free market.
   East Germans now are dependent on subsidized food, housing and
jobs.
   ``A law that adjusts for social shortcomings in East Germany ..
. is of essential significance,'' Romberg said in Bonn, where he
met with West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel.
   Some East Germans want guarantees that prices and rents will not
rise at a vastly sharper rate than their wages. Kohl's government
says the influx of new Western businesses will raise living
standards in East Germany.
   The agreement would convert East German wages, pensions and
small savings accounts at a 1-1 exchange to the West German mark.
   It also would convert debts owned by East German factories _
estimated at 200 billion East German marks _ at a 2-1 rate. Those
debts now will be worth 100 billion West German marks, or $60
billion, but with Western interest rates.
   Some economists have said that the debts should be forgiven
entirely to allow the factories to get a fresh start in the free
market.

<HEAD>Government Continues Dolphin-Swimming Permits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to allow people and
captive dolphins swim together for at least another year.
   Permits for three Swim-with-the-Dolphis programs in Florida and
one in Hawaii have been extended through the end of 1991, the
National Marine Fisheries Service announced. The permits had been
scheduled to expire April 30.
   However, for the time being no new permits will be issued and no
new dolphins may be captured for use in these programs, the agency
said.
   Permits for the programs were first issued in 1985. The Marine
Fisheries Service reports that it has received hundreds of letters
from environmentalists concerned about the health and safety of the
dolphins involved.
   The extension of the permits will require that the operators
give the dolphins additional rest periods, increased security and a
means of escape from the swimming public.
   The service said it has found no evidence that dolphins in these
programs suffer any more health problems than dolphins on public
display in aquariums. However, officials plan to monitor these
programs during the coming year to determine if they should be
allowed to continue and if other permits should be issued.
   The fisheries service is a part of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

   An official who handled student affairs at the
Chinese Embassy here has defected and is seeking political asylum
in the United States, a spokesman for a student organization said
today.
   The spokesman, Qing Xiao of the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars, said Xu Lin, 33, a third secretary
at the embassy, defected Wednesday night out of sympathy with the
students' goals.
   Qing said Xu applied to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for asylum on Thursday.
   Duke Austin, an INS spokesman, declined comment. He said it was
the service's policy to make no comment on asylum applications
unless the person seeking asylum personally made his action public.
   Qing said Xu would hold a news conference today.
   Qing said Xu first contacted the State Department and was told
to make his application to the INS. State Department press officers
were in a staff meeting and not immediately available.
   Wu Zurong, first secretary in the press office at the Chinese
Embassy, said he was not familiar with Xu's reported defection but
would check.
   The student federation, based in Washington, was formed last
year to protect the rights of an estimated 40,000 Chinese students
in the United States. It also says it seeks to promote democracy in
China.
   After the Chinese crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square
last June, Xu helped Chinese students in the United States renew
their passports, Qing said. He also said Xu avoided reporting on
student activities to government officials.
   Some Chinese diplomats in the United States and elsewhere
defected after the June crackdown.

   Three men planting explosives near
a British military barracks today fired at a guard before fleeing
their bungled bombing attempt, officials said.
   Investigators later found 65 pounds of the high-powered
explosive Semtex in three satchels outside a housing block at the
British army's Langenhagen Barracks in Hanover, British military
officials said.
   It was not known who was responsible.
   A Ministry of Defense spokesman in London said: ``We cannot say
the men were IRA at this moment in time. All we can say is that
they were terrorists.''
   The Irish Republican Army has been blamed for numerous attacks
against British military installations in West Germany over the
past few years.
   The IRA has waged a campaign to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the
overwhelming Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   According to police, a civilian guard making the rounds with a
security dog noticed three suspicious people on the barracks
grounds about 2 a.m.
   Three shots were fired by the people, said a British military
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the guard
was not injured.
   Col. Henry Day, Chief of Public Information for the British
Forces in Germany, said the attackers had cut a hole in the
barracks' perimeter fence. He told British Broadcasting Corp. radio
that 70 soldiers were moved from the building.
   ``It was Semtex, with a wire timing device,'' Day said.
   He said one satchel contained 10 blocks of explosives, and the
second nine blocks. He said he had no details on the third.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mason E. Hale, an internationally known
Smithsonian Institution botanist, has died of cancer at age 61.
   Hale, who worked for the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History, had published more than 150 studies, including
five books on lichens, which grow as alga and fungus on rocks,
trees and soil.
   He died Monday at his Arlington, Va., home. A memorial service
was held Tuesday.
   In one study, Hale's research found that lead accumulation in
lichens showed a noticeable increase as a result of emissions from
cars crossing a bridge over the Potomac River. The lichens were
found on a Potomac island near Washington.
   During his 33 years at the Smithsonian, Hale built the National
Museum of Natural History lichen collection into the world's third
largest through gifts, exchanges and his world travels.
   A native of Winstead, Conn., Hale received a bachelor's degree
from Yale University and master's and doctorate degrees from the
University of Wisconsin. He taught at the University of Wichita in
Kansas and at the University of West Virginia before he was hired
as a curator in the Museum of Natural History's botany department.
   Survivors include his wife, Beatrice Hale; two daughters; a son;
his mother and two brothers.

<HEAD>North Texas Struggles Against Worst Flooding Since 1922</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 2nd to UPDATE with Oklahoma and
Arkansas flooding. Adds 2 grafs at end with Arkansas damage,
precautions.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Skies were clear early today in northern Texas and
a dry spell forecast for the next few days was likely to alleviate
the worst flooding in the region in more than half a century.
   There was no rain early today but areas that were heavily
flooded in the region could still experience problems, forecasters
warned. They said that May is the region's wettest month. Any more
heavy rain in the next couple of weeks is likely to cause
substantial flooding, said meteorologist Skip Ely.
   For the first time in 33 years, water gushed over the spillway
at Lake Texoma Dam into the Red River, which forms the
Texas-Oklahoma state line. At least 100 people were evacuated from
homes east and west of the lake in southern Oklahoma.
   The flooding extended downstream to Arkansas, where authorities
were giving out sandbags and preparing emergency shelters today.
   Heavy rains damaged hundreds of homes and left at least three
dead in the Fort Worth area on Wednesday.
   ``There is still water moving out there, and moving water is
dangerous,'' said Alton Bostick, emergency management coordinator
for Fort Worth and Tarrant County. ``People should not drive into
it. They don't know the depth and if there are no barricades
around, they should be very cautious.''
   In Dallas, the Trinity River crested Thursday night at 47 feet,
17 feet above flood level, its deepest level since 1949.
   As much as 7 inches of rain fell from late Wednesday to early
Thursday in some areas.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said while touring south of Dallas on
Thursday that if Gov. Bill Clements applies for federal aid for
other areas, he will find ``a very cooperative president.''
   President Bush signed a disaster declaration Thursday for four
counties hard-hit in flooding last week. Country officials in
Dallas and Fort Worth were expected to begin applying for federal
relief funds today.
   Boats, cars and even dump trucks were used to evacuate people
stranded on doorsteps and rooftops. Many roads were flooded,
including four feet of water over the C.F. Hawn Freeway, a main
north-south artery in Dallas.
   ``We took people off rooftops, off of cars. Some of the homes
are totally under water,'' fire department spokeswoman Carolyn
Garcia said.
   The tail end of the storms Thursday spawned two tornadoes that
caused minor damage near Nacogdoches. Earlier in the day, a tornado
struck the outskirts of Paris, about 100 miles northeast of Dallas.
Eight people suffered minor injuries and two businesses and 16
homes were damaged, officials said.
   Eagle Mountain Lake north of Fort Worth was expected to reach
record levels Saturday morning.
   ``It is higher than '81 and just short of 1957 when it got to 10
feet over the spillway. The all-time high for Eagle Mountain was 11
feet over in 1942,'' said Mike Williams of Tarrant County Water
Control and Improvement District No. 1. ``On Lake Bridgeport, this
is largest amount we've ever had.''
   The Brazos River continued a ``slow and steady'' rise but was
expected to crest late today barring any additional rain, said Fire
Marshal Mike Paschal. Hundreds of people along the Brazos were
evacuated Wednesday for the second time in two weeks.
   ``Right now, they're still evacuated,'' Paschal said. ``A few
are going back during the daylight hours to get what they can
salvage.''
   In Arkansas, authorities estimated recent flood damage to roads
and bridges at $7 million.
   Gov. Bill Clinton authorized use of 75 Army National Guardsmen
for sandbagging along the Arkansas River at Fort Smith, on the
Oklahoma line. After thunderstorms moved across the state from the
west Thursday night, the river was forecast to crest well above
flood stage beginning today at Fort Smith and extending through
Monday downstream at Pine Bluff.

   The California Supreme Court has ruled
reporters can be required to testify in a criminal case if their
testimony would help the defense.
   The decision Thursday involved a Los Angeles Times reporter and
photographer who had refused to testify in a weapons possession
case, citing the state's ``shield law.'' The law protects reporters
from being held in contempt of court or jailed for refusing to
disclose news sources or unpublished information.
   The court unanimously concluded that the 1980 law protects
observations made during news gathering, in addition to
undisclosed, confidential notes or tapes.
   But the court also ruled the law cannot be used to violate a
criminal defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial, and that
testimony can be compelled if there is a ``reasonable possibility
the information will materially assist (the) defense.''
   Applying those standards, the court said reporter Roxana
Kopetman and photographer Roberto Santiago Bertero must testify
about whether they saw or heard a man agree to a search of his
jacket when he was arrested by Long Beach police in 1987. Officers
said they found illegal brass knuckles in the jacket, but the
evidence will be excluded if the search was without consent.
   Rex Heinke, lawyer for Ms. Kopetman and Bertero, said a U.S.
Supreme Court appeal would be considered.
   The court did not resolve one important question, whether a
prosecutor has a similar ability to compel a reporter's testimony.
But Justice David Eagleson, who wrote the opinion, said the court
did not have to decide that issue in this case.
   Heinke said the ``logical implications'' of the decision were
that the media could not be compelled by the prosecutor in a
criminal case, or by either side in a civil suit not directly
involving the press.
   ``If those are the implications, then it's a substantial victory
for the press, although not in this particular case,'' he said.
   Albert Menaster, the Los Angeles public defender who sought the
testimony, said the ruling was a victory for his client ``but I do
not consider it a loss for the press.'' He said the court had set
reasonable standards for balancing the rights of reporters and
defendants.
   Ms. Kopetman and Bertero were riding with Long Beach police in
September 1987 when they saw officers question and search Sean
Patrick Delaney, 21.
   The newspaper's article four days later mentioned the incident,
but did not say whether Delaney consented to the search of his
jacket pocket, the crucial issue for a still-pending charge of
possessing brass knuckles.
   Ms. Kopetman and Bertero refused to testify, citing the shield
law. They were held in contempt of court and that decision was
upheld by the 2nd District Court of Appeal, which said the law did
not apply to observations of public events.
   The Supreme Court disagreed with that conclusion, saying
``unpublished information'' protected by the law included
non-confidential observations. But the court said the reporters'
shield was overcome in this case by the defendant's need for the
testimony.
   ``Delaney's personal liberty is at stake,'' Eagleson wrote.
``The reporteres are not being asked to breach a confidence or to
disclose sensitive information that would in any way even remotely
restrict their newsgathering ability.
   ``All that is being required of them is to accept the civic
responsibility imposed on all persons who witness alleged criminal
conduct.''

<HEAD>Ex-HUD Official Providing More Detail on Pierce</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with Gilliam testimony; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An imprisoned former Housing and Urban
Development official testified today that former Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr. directed federal grants to friends, including a
``down and out'' former campaign manager.
   DuBois L. Gilliam said Pierce ordered one $350,000 grant because
his friend and former political manager, Sam Singletary, needed
help.
   The grant was arranged despite the lack of a request from a city
that was to benefit from the project, and a lack of experience by
Singletary and his partner, who applied for the grant as a
non-profit private group, Gilliam said.
   The grants, along with others Gilliam described, were from the
department's technical assistance program, with money coming from
the secretary's discretionary program.
   Gilliam testified that virtually all the money from that program
was distributed based on political connections _ and that he and
Pierce both expressed surprise when they discovered that one
applicant for a grant on their approved list had no political
connections.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the
program ``was administered politically, as a cross between a slush
fund and a political action committee.''
   ``The whole scheme is so incredible, so unreal,'' Lantos said.
   Gilliam said he traveled to Camden, N.J., to meet with the mayor
to persuade him that HUD intended to provide the $350,000 grant to
Singletary's group if he would go along with the project, which was
intended to help the city with community development projects.
   He said Pierce ``indicated he wanted to help Mr. Singletary get
some funds. He was down and out ... And I did so. ... He told me to
fund the project.''
   Gilliam also told congressional investigators that he directed a
grant to another group because of its connection to a brother of
Pierce. He did not identify the brother, but committee staff
director Stuart Weisberg identified him before the meeting as
Burton Pierce.
   Gilliam said Pierce called him about the $257,000 project and
``told me he wanted to get the project funded.''
   A Republican, Pierce was appointed a New York state judge in
1959 and lost an election bid for a full term as judge in 1960,
said Weisberg, staff director of Lantos' House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing.
   Gilliam was appearing for a third day before the panel, which
has spent more than a year investigating fraud, influence-peddling
and political favoritism at HUD Reagan administration.
   Gilliam, a former deputy assistant secretary of HUD, pleaded
guilty to abusing HUD programs and accepting illegal gratuities. He
is serving an 18-month sentence at the federal prison in Lompoc,
Calif., and has been testifying under a grant of immunity from
further prosecution.
   In two previous days of testimony, Gilliam has said that he,
Pierce and others manipulated programs to direct federal grants and
lucrative subsidies to friends, sometimes before any formal
applications were made.
   ``The determining factor in awarding technical assistance grants
was on the particular people behind each project, rather than on
the quality of the project,'' Lantos said.
   While the secretary had discretion to direct grants under the
technical assistance programs, Weisberg said basing decisions on
politics could be considered an abuse of the program and against
the intent of Congress.
   Gilliam's testimony has contradicted Pierce's sworn statement to
the subcommittee a year ago that he was not directly involved in
deciding who got HUD grants, Weisberg said.
   ``The technical assistance program is probably the one program
that Pierce was most involved in _ the one that was most
political,'' he said.
   Paul L. Perito, a lawyer for Pierce, attacked Gilliam's
credibility, calling him ``an admitted cheat and liar.''
   ``Mr. Pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing and improper
conduct,'' Perito said.
   After testifying once in May 1989, Pierce invoked his
constitutional rights against self-incrimination and refused
further testimony.
   Special prosecutor Arlin Adams, appointed by a federal court to
investigate Pierce, said he would have no comment on Gilliam's
testimony.

<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party has trounced Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in local elections,
making its best showing since she came to power 11 years ago,
tallies showed today.
   But the Conservatives averted the rout forecast by opinion
polls. And Mrs. Thatcher maintained that despite a big 11 percent
swing against the government, she had the basis for winning a
fourth term in 1991 or 1992.
   ``We've lost some we hoped to hold ... but we have a very good
basis on which to go forward and win the next general election.''
   She was speaking a day after the poll at a news conference at
Waddesdon Manor, northwest of London, with visiting French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labor Party, said the results showed
broad support for his party throughout England.
   ``That is the spread of support that we need which makes me
forecast that we are certain to win the next election,'' Kinnock
said.
   For the first time since James Callaghan's Labor government lost
power to Mrs. Thatcher in 1979, the socialist party made
significant gains in the Tory heartlands of the prosperous south.
   The Conservatives, in deep trouble over the economy and the
so-called poll tax that prompted nationwide protests, lost control
in a clutch of previously safe southern English towns, including
Portsmouth, Torbay and Gillingham.
   But the Conservatives performed strongly in London. They held
two key boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster, which have set the
lowest poll tax rates in the country and are lauded by Mrs.
Thatcher.
   One sore loss for Labor was its loss of control to the
Conservatives in the London borough of Ealing, where Kinnock makes
his home.
   The governing party failed to gain ground in north England and
remained virtually shut out in Scotland.
   After 196 of 201 councils were declared, a tally by the British
domestic news agency, Press Association, showed the Tories lost 355
seats and gained 143, while Labor notched up 431 gains and 120
losses. The centrists and minor parties, except the Scottish
nationalists, all had net losses.
   With incomplete results in, Labor had made 10 gains to control
89 councils. The Conservatives, who had controlled 60 councils,
lost 12 and gained four.
   The third-running centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party
lost three and gained two. No party had overall control in the rest.
   A computer analysis by the British Broadcasting Corp. showed an
11 percent swing in popular voting against the government since
1987, when Mrs. Thatcher began her third term. That margin would be
enough to give Labor a comfortable win in a general election.
   The latest Gallup poll published today in London's
pro-Conservative newspaper The Daily Telegraph showed just 23
percent of voters satisfied with her performance. It was the worst
rating for any British leader since opinion polling began about 50
years ago.
   But some commentators predicted the local election results would
lessen speculation Mrs. Thatcher will retire or be ousted as party
leader before the next election in 1991 or 1992.
   In a key result, the Conservatives retained control with a
hugely increased majority of the south London borough of
Wandsworth. It set the lowest per-capita tax in the country: $243
per person compared with an average of $580.
   Wandsworth's Labor leader, Fiona McTaggart, called the low tax a
``bribe that's worked for them.''
   The tax, which replaced a local property tax April 1, is
officially known as a community charge but is dubbed a poll tax.
   It is widely viewed as unfair because everyone in the same
district pays the same, regardless of income. Instead of just 17
million homeowners being liable, all 38 million adults must pay,
with rebates for the 9.5 million poorest.
   Mrs. Thatcher says it is fairer for everyone to pay, and she
expected Labor councils would be blamed for high bills. However,
most households are paying more and blaming her.
   The poll tax raises about one-fourth of the $37.7 billion needed
for local services including education, police, subsidized housing
and garbage collection.

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian leaders on both
sides of a gambling dispute were furious at being excluded from a
meeting where U.S. and Canadian officials discussed setting up a
new Mohawk government.
   During a 3{-hour meeting Thursday in Montreal about 30 U.S. and
Canadian officials discussed creating one Mohawk government to
replace three fractious councils now governing the reserve
straddling the U.S.-Canadian border.
   ``This meeting today was designed to work out all the options to
stop the fighting,'' said Harry Swain, Canada's deputy minister of
Indian affairs. ``Everything that was said occurred with the
knowledge and blessing of the Mohawk people on the reserve, and we
will take our findings back to them immediately.''
   New York state troopers today continued to occupy the
reservation, stopping residents for identification as they walked
or drove through the territory. At least three state police cars
were stationed at most intersections, and the reservation was quiet
except for traditional morning chants.
   But Indian leaders on the reservation were angry.
   ``If, in fact, they want to do this with the proper recognition
of the sovereignty of the people, then they must do it in a
coordinated community-wide fashion,'' said Harold Tarbell, an
anti-gambling spokesman in the Canadian town of Cornwall.
   ``That's the problem, the people are not consulted about
decisions made for their benefit,'' said Francis Boots, a spokesman
for the Warrior Society, a pro-gambling group.
   A nine-month conflict over the operation of lucrative gambling
casinos on the 28,000-acre reservation culminated this week in two
shooting deaths. The victims were one gambling supporter and one
gambling opponent.
   After the shootings Tuesday, Canadian and U.S. security forces
moved into the reservation.
   The Warrior Society, a self-proclaimed security force that
patrols the American side of the reservation, describes the police
as ``foreign'' armies, and wants them to leave. Many of the other
Mohawks approve of the operation if it results in peace.
   The three Mohawk governments are the Mohawk Indian Nation, which
includes Mohawks on both sides of the border; the Mohawk Tribal
Council, on the American side, and the Band Council on the Canadian
side.
   Swain said Canadian and U.S. police will remain on the
reservation until they are sure no more shooting will erupt.
   But some reinforcements from the Canadian army started pulling
away Thursday night, said Maj. Gerald Baril of the Canadian
National Defense headquarters in Ottawa. He said two military
helicopters will remain on standby until at least the end of the
week.
   Residents went about their business Thursday under the eye of
the security forces. More than 1,000 people remained camped out in
dormitory rooms of a government training college in Cornwall. Other
refugees were taken in at National Guard facilities on the New York
side.
   But some were determined not to leave their homes.
   ``Most of us here in the neighborhood have stayed,'' said Bonnie
Bradley, who lives with her parents, two children and two nephews.
``I don't feel terrorized by this. I'm not part of either side, so
I have no reason to watch my back. But I wish it were over. I do
wish it were over.''

   A federal judge levied a $115.5 million
penalty against officers of the collapsed Champion Insurance Co.,
but warned state officials that they may have difficulty collecting
the money.
   Alabama officials said they would work with their counterparts
from Louisiana to try to get the money from what was once Alabama's
fourth largest auto insurance company.
   Champion went into liquidation in June 1989, leaving behind
pending auto insurance claims from 10,000 customers. Champion
officers have been indicted on charges of siphoning off $37 million
from policies.
   At Thursday's court hearing, Montgomery attorney Charles Crook,
representing the state government, said the large penalty in a
civil case against Champion would be a deterrent and show other
insurance companies ``that these matters are policed.''
   ``That is if you ever collect,'' U.S. District Judge Robert
Varner told the attorney.
   The penalty imposed by Varner was the highest judgment allowed
by the civil court provisions of federal racketeering laws. The
judgment is triple the state government's anticipated loss from
Champion's demise _ $38.5 million.
   The Eicher family that ran the insurance company based in Baton
Rouge, La., has had its assets frozen.
   ``We'll be working with the Louisiana liquidators in taking
appropriate actions to locate assets and enforce the judgment,''
Crook said after the hearing. ``I realize some practical difficulty
with whether assets of that amount are available.''
   Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman said the judgment does
not mean Alabama will immediately receive the money. But he said,
``Payment of claims is the responsibility of Champion and I intend
to do everything within my power to make sure that responsibility
is honored.''
   Gov. Guy Hunt said the ruling ``should be a message to any
company that is should be fair and straightforward with the people
of Alabama.''
   The $115.5 million is in addition to separate criminal theft
charges against 64-year-old John Eicher and six other family
members and former officers of Champion. They were indicted by a
Montgomery County grand jury in March.

<HEAD>Blood Banks to Routinely Screen for Hepatitis C</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood bank agencies say they will start
routinely screening blood donations for hepatitis C, the most
common serious infection spread by blood transfusion.
   The American Association of Blood Banks, the American Red Cross
and the Council of Community Blood Centers announced in a joint
statement Thursday that blood will be screened using a new test
licensed Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration.
   By some estimates, about 7,500 to 20,000 of the 4 million
Americans receiving blood transfusions annually develop acute
hepatitis C. Officials said the new test could halve that number.
   Jon MacPherson, executive director of the Council of Community
Blood Centers, said the groups also suggest that patients who have
received blood transfusions within the last 20 years consider being
tested for hepatitis C.
   Hepatitis C, formerly called hepatitis non-A, non-B, is thought
to be caused by a virus called HCV. It infects from 150,000 to
200,000 Americans annually. Only 5 to 10 percent of these cases are
attributed to blood transfusions. Other sources are thought to be
shared drug needles and, some studies suggest, sexual relations.
The source of at least half of the hepatitis C infections, however,
is unknown.
   Symptoms for most patients are mild and the disease usually is
not diagnosed. There is no generally available treatment.
   For 10 to 20 percent of the patients, hepatitis C can be
serious, leading to life-threatening liver disease, or cirrhosis.

<HEAD>Greater Political Freedom for Federal Workers Advances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has disregarded a threatened veto
by President Bush and moved toward allowing the nation's 3 million
federal civil service and postal workers to participate more in
party politics.
   On a 67-30 vote, Democrats on Thursday defeated an amendment by
Senate Republicans aimed at derailing a bill to remove most
restrictions on political activities by federal employees imposed
by the 1939 Hatch Act.
   The Democratic bill would revise the law to lift prohibitions
that bar federal civil service employees from holding office in
political parties, working in campaigns or soliciting campaign
dollars from fellow workers.
   However, it would continue prohibitions on federal workers
running for public office, soliciting campaign funds from the
general public or engaging in political activities while on the job.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
current restrictions ``illogical and unnecessary.''
   The Republican amendment by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., would
have substituted the proposed changes with an order directing the
Office of Personnel Management to ``simplify and clarify'' what
Roth acknowledged are confusing regulations under the law.

<HEAD>Postal Service Will Test Stamp Sales at ATMs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is planning to sell
polyester postage stamps through automatic teller machines at banks
in a six-month test beginning May 18 in Seattle.
   Spokesman Art Shealy announced Thursday that the stamps will be
test-marketed in a joint venture by the Postal Service and Seafirst
Bank, first at about 15 Seattle locations and then at other
Seafirst branches in Washington state.
   Shealy said the sheets of stamps were designed to resemble
currency so that they can be dispensed the same way cash is
dispensed through the machines.
   He said the sheets, each with a dozen 25-cent stamps, would cost
$3 apiece, debited against the customer's bank account.
   The stamp is designed to be self-adhesive, requiring no licking,
Shealy said.
   ``We think it answers quite a large portion of the public's
request for a more convenient stamp,'' he said. ``It is
humidity-resistant so they don't stick together. It is really a
stamp of the future.''
   If the Seattle test is a success, Shealy said, the stamps will
be tried out nationwide in the spring of 1991.

<TEXT>
   The former wife of singer David Bowie says she
once found her husband in bed with Rolling Stone Mick Jagger.
   Angela Bowie, who has been divorced from the creator of ``Ziggy
Stardust'' for 10 years, appeared on ``The Joan Rivers Show'' today
and said she had caught Bowie ``in bed with men several times. In
fact, one of the best times I caught him in bed with Mick Jagger.''
   The studio audience hooted and hollered, and Miss Rivers shouted
``all right!'' Exhorted by shock-humor radio personality Howard
Stern, Ms. Bowie said the discovery didn't please her, but there
was nothing she could do about it. She did not interrupt, she said.
   ``I made breakfast,'' she said.
   Ms. Bowie did not say when the incident occurred. Nor did she
offer any details. She agreed that Bowie had dumped her, but denied
that she was bitter or angry at him.
   The Bowies were divorced in February 1980. The Daily News
reported that under the terms of the divorce, Ms. Bowie received
$700,000 over 10 years, under the condition that she not speak
publicly about her husband. That gag order expired April 1,
according to the News.
   Ms. Bowie made several references while on the show to a
settlement with her former husband that she implied may be
forthcoming.
   In the early part of the show, Ms. Bowie skated around questions
from Ms. Rivers, who had said at the opening that her guest was
``ready to dish and I mean down and dirty dishing about her ex.''
   When Ms. Bowie was not forthcoming _ ``I actually don't like
kissing and telling,'' she said _ she was led off camera. Ms.
Rivers and Stern, her next guest, ridiculed the departed Ms. Bowie
for failing to spill her guts, and she returned to the studio.
   Bowie has told interviewers in the past that he is a bisexual.
Jagger has made no such statement.
   Calls to Bowie's spokesman, Bernard Docherty, in London did not
go through; the telephone is disconnected.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say Appeal Coming on Dowaliby Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys say they will appeal the
conviction of a man found guilty of murdering his 7-year-old
stepdaughter and hiding her body in the woods.
   Prosecutors ``did not prove their case beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' said Ralph Mecyzk, an attorney for convicted murderer
David Dowaliby. ``The jury did not separate the enormity of the
crime from the evidence.
   ``Everything the state gave them, they swallowed.''
   A Cook County circuit court jury convicted Dowaliby on Thursday
after almost 14 hours of deliberations over three days.
   Prosecutors contended Dowaliby and his wife, Cynthia, murdered
the girl in her bedroom in September 1988, dumped the body and
faked evidence to convince police that Jaclyn had been abducted by
a home invader. The defense contended that the intruder came in
through a basement window while the family slept.
   ``It's an enormous victory for Jaclyn Dowaliby and for all
children abandoned by their parents who have only the system to
protect them,'' said assistant state's attorney Patrick O'Brien.
``The evidence won the case.''
   On Tuesday, Judge Richard Neville acquitted Mrs. Dowaliby for
lack of evidence.
   Dowaliby was taken to the Cook County Jail after Neville revoked
his bond pending a hearing on Monday. Mrs. Dowaliby was given a
chance to say goodbye to her husband before he left the courtroom.
   ``She was extremely disappointed,'' said Lawrence Hyman, Mrs.
Dowaliby's attorney. ``She is resigned in her determination to
battle to free her husband. She says he husband is as innocent as
she is, and she is ready to show the appellate court that the jury
verdict was wrong.''
   Dowaliby, 33, was convicted of killing Jaclyn on Sept. 10, 1988,
at the family's suburban Midlothian home and dumping her body in a
wooded area behind an apartment complex in nearby Blue Island. Her
body was found four days later.
   Sentencing was set for June 4. Dowaliby faces imprisonment of 20
to 80 years, lawyers said. O'Brien would not say whether the
prosecution would press for the maximum.

Talks</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and the African
National Congress announced today they had made an ``important
breakthrough'' by agreeing to work together to end political
violence in South Africa.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela, looking
relaxed after three days of historic talks, told a news conference
they had made major progress toward creating a normal political
climate that would clear the way for bringing blacks into the
national government.
   ``I regard what is contained in this document as an important
breakthrough in the peace process,'' de Klerk said.
   The two sides issued a joint communique outlining steps to end
political violence and remove remaining obstacles to full-scale
constitutional negotiations.
   ``The government and the ANC agree on a common commitment
towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and
intimidation from whatever quarter as well as a commitment to
stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations,'' the joint
statement said.
   The communique said a working group would report by May 21 on
ways to overcome remaining obstacles to constitutional
negotiations. But de Klerk told reporters no date had been set for
further talks between the two sides.
   The two leaders said the three days of talks, the first ever
between the ANC and the government, had been an important step
forward. They praised each other's sincerity and determination to
find a peaceful solution to South Africa's racial divisions.
   ``I look to the future with confidence,'' de Klerk said.
   Mandela was equally positive, saying the most striking feature
of the negotiations had been there ``cordiality.''
   ``We have had discussions on sensitive matters in a spirit of
conciliation and understanding,'' Mandela said.
   The joint statement outlined five steps to be taken to try to
settle remaining ANC demands for full-scale negotiations.
   The steps include establishment of the working group to actually
handle practical matters; the granting of temporary immunity from
prosecution for political offenses for selected top ANC officials;
a government review of existing security legislation; and the
establishment of channels of communication between the two sides to
halt violence.
   The declaration said the government committed itself ``to work
towards the lifting of the state of emergency'' _ a key ANC demand.
``In this context the ANC will exert itself to fulfill the
objective contained in the preamble,'' the communique stated.
   The state of emergency has been in effect since June 1986. The
ANC says the emergency is used by police to suppress political
activity and peaceful dissent.
   The government says it wants to lift the emergency, but that it
remains necessary to combat black factional fighting that has
claimed more than 600 lives this year.
   The ANC is seeking amnesty for its estimated 15,000 exiles and
the release of all prisoners convicted of politically motivated
crimes.
   So far, de Klerk has released some political activists convicted
of acts that did not involve violence and offered temporary
immunity to ANC officials involved in the talks. Legislation that
could provide amnesty to exiles and prisoners is under
consideration in Parliament.
   The government is demanding the ANC renounce its largely
ineffective guerrilla campaign. De Klerk also wants the ANC to
assist the government in ending the political violence in the
southeastern province of Natal and elsewhere.
   De Klerk has been reluctant to grant outright pardons to ANC
guerrillas accused or convicted of violent attacks for fear of a
white backlash. Many whites are unhappy with the government's rapid
reforms and still regard the ANC as a terrorist group.
   If the two sides reach agreement on holding constitutional
negotiations, white and black leaders warn such discussions will be
difficult and prolonged with major differences to be resolved.
   The government insists that any new constitution extending
political rights to the country's 28 million blacks must include
guarantees to safeguard the interests of the 5 million whites and
other minorities.

   U.S. military personnel participated in the air
assault that killed cocaine kingpin Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha at
a ranch on the Colombian coast Dec. 15, New York Newsday reported
today.
   President Bush and the Colombian government have denied such
involvement.
   Newsday, citing several unidentified U.S. government sources,
reported that U.S. forces helped plan the assault and three or four
U.S. military personnel helped operate the two helicopters that
carried it out.
   Rodriguez Gacha, his son and several bodyguards were killed by
gunfire from one of the helicopters as they tried to flee. One of
the helicopters was fired on first, and Newsday reported that the
commanding officer, identified by one source as an American, gave
the order to fire back.
   Rodriguez Gacha, 42, was one of the most powerful of the
Colombian cocaine bosses.
   At a news conference Thursday, Bush repeated administration
denials of U.S. military involvement: ``U.S. troops in Colombia?
No. That's the answer.'' Newsday said the head of the Colombian
federal police, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, denied U.S. involvement
in an interview in Bogota last week.
   Newsday said it had information from more than six sources about
a U.S. role in the mission, including an Army Special Forces staff
member, three other defense sources, a House aide and a Senate aide
who said he was briefed by Pentagon officials.
   The Senate aide said he was told that ``a handful'' of U.S.
special operations troops participated with a much larger
contingent of Colombians, and that the U.S. role was pre-eminent,
Newsday reported. Another source said the Colombian presence was
characterized as ``window dressing.''
   ``Officially we say they did it, but in fact we did it,'' a
congressional source said, according to Newsday.
   A source described as having close ties to U.S. intelligence
said four Spanish-speaking Americans operated the radios and
sophisticated electronic tracking equipment aboard the two
helicopters, while Colombians manned the on-board machine guns.
   At least one of the helicopters belonged to the U.S. Southern
command, based in Panama, and the source said Americans had
operational control of the mission, Newsday reported. One source
identified one of the Americans as an Army officer assigned to the
CIA, it said.
   Sources said the mission was covert, with American involvement
protected by ``plausible deniability,'' meaning it was to be
carried out in a fashion that would enable U.S. officials to say
they were unaware of it, the report said.
   Citing two congressional sources, it said the House and Senate
intelligence committees were notified of the operation through a
presidential ``finding'' that declared the mission was in the
national interest.

   Security forces killed 23 suspected
Kurdish guerrillas in two clashes in southeastern and eastern
Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported Friday.
   The dispatch said three village guards were also killed during
the fighting Thursday.
   Anatolia said 17 guerrillas were killed in Sirnak township near
the Iraqi border in one of the largest anti-guerrilla operations in
the region since fighting started in 1984. It added that security
forces seized seven machine guns and a rocket launcher.
   In a clash in Dilekli village of Yuksekova township, local
guards fired on a group of Kurdish guerrillas, killing one, the
report said. Three guards were killed.
   Anatolia also reported that security forces killed five
guerrillas in the eastern province of Kars. No other details were
given.
   The guerrillas belong to the Kurdish Labor Party, a Marxist
group fighting to establish an independent nation in Turkey's
southeastern provinces. The group has camps in neighboring Syria,
Iraq and Iran, security officials say.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of students opposed to the
selection of a military general as Taiwan's new premier disrupted a
parliamentary session Friday, and hundreds more protested for a
third day in a downtown park.
   About 500 college students were participating in the park rally,
which began after President Lee Teng Hui chose Defense minister Hau
Pei-tsun to be premier.
   Shouting pro-democracy and anti-military slogans, the students
held a sit-in and listened to speeches. Hundreds of riot police
monitored the demonstration.
   Earlier, a session of the lawmaking Legislative Yuan was
disrupted when about 60 students clashed with police inside the
building. The students unfurled banners that read ``Oppose Military
Interference'' and ``Hau lacks popular support.''
   Two students suffered minor injuries during the brief scuffle,
witnesses said.
   President Lee's selection of Hau, Taiwan's only four-star
general, as head of the Cabinet has sparked heated debates in the
legislature.
   Opposition lawmakers criticized the move as a step backward for
democracy. But Lee said Friday he believed Hau, 71, would bring
political stability and social order to Taiwan.
   In a meeting with lawmakers, Lee described his decision as
``strong medicine'' to cure the island's soaring crime rate and
worsening economy.
   Hau was appointed defense minister last year after being chief
of the 500,000-member armed forces for eight years.

<TEXT>
   Soccer fans angered by cancellation of a game
looted and set fire to scores of buildings in a city in Uzbekistan
during rioting that injured at least 44 people, news reports said
Friday.
   The fans, many intoxicated, ran wild through the city of
Andizhan in the Fergana Valley of eastern Uzbekistan on Wednesday.
The Andizhan region, with a population of 1.6 million, is plagued
by severe unemployment. Jobless number 80,000.
   Last summer, more than 100 people were killed in ethnic rioting
between Uzbeks and another Turkish ethnic group, the Meskhetians,
in the nearby city of Fergana.
   In the latest violence, rioters attacked the Andizhan regional
Communist Party headquarters and the city prosecutor's office, as
well as 125 other buildings, 79 stores and 36 homes, the official
Tass news agency reported.
   An official at the party headquarters, reached by telephone,
said it was too noisy to hear the caller because the walls and
windows were missing. He refused to say anything more.
   The mob set fire to 13 stores, 46 workshops and dozens of homes,
and destroyed 18 institutions, including libraries, the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda said. Interior Ministry troops restored
order.
   The violence began when 10,000 fans waiting in afternoon heat
were told a team from Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, had failed to
show up for the game, Pravda said.
   The crowd began throwing rocks and beat up the chairman of the
local soccer club, the newspaper said. Fans set fire to two police
cars and to a car that was to have been given away in a drawing at
the game, Pravda said.
   The injured included 13 Interior Ministry troops, 10 police
officers and 11 civilians, Tass said. Pravda put the injury toll at
44.
   The independent news service Post Factum said the mob killed the
stadium director and burned the stadium to the ground.
   However, Pravda and a spokesman for the republic's legislature,
Eduard Tsoy, said there were no deaths. Tsoy also denied the
stadium was destroyed.
   Armed with automatic weapons, the crowd rampaged through
neighborhoods of Russians, Armenians and Jews, leaving the Armenian
quarter smoldering, Post Factum said.
   The news service also quoted an unnamed member of the
out-of-town team as saying the game was canceled because riots were
planned for Andizhan that day.
   The reports could not be confirmed immediately because
communications with Andizhan were cut.
   Akilov Said-Ali of the grass-roots political group Berlik in
Tashkent said that Berlik members at the stadium tried to prevent
violence by standing between the fans and the police. He said many
of them were injured and that the local Berlik leader suffered two
broken legs.
   Said-Ali and Tsoy said Adizhan was quiet Friday.
   Post Factum also said a large number of Moslems from the Fergana
Valley traveled to Tashkent on Thursday to demand the retirement of
the Central Asian mufti, 37-year-old Mohammadsadyk Mamayusupov. The
group blames him for the Andizhan riots, the news service said. It
did not elaborate.
   Said-Ali said the mufti met with representatives from Andizhan
and other cities Thursday and set up a commission to look into
their complaints. But he did not know any details.
   Mamayusupov was named mufti last year after his predecessor was
accused of failing to lead a religious life.
   Mamayusupov moved quickly to win government approval for the
opening of new mosques. Last year, there were only 200 mosques
sprinkled across the five Central Asian republics. The republics _
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Turkmenia and Tadzhikistan _
occupy an area half the size of the continental United States.

   A twin-engine cargo plane crashed and
caught fire today as it attempted to land at the airport, killing
one man and critically injuring another, authorities said.
   The plane was carrying packages from Raleigh to Wilmington when
it crashed at the New Hanover County International Airport, said
Jean Nipper of United Parcel Service.
   Audra West, spokeswoman for New Hanover Memorial Hospital, said
two people were brought to the hospital, one dead on arrival and
the other in critical condition.
   The plane belonged Tar Heel Aviation of Jacksonville, N.C., a
charter service. Charles Brown, a pilot with Tar Heel, identified
the dead crew member as co-pilot Darryl Banks, 24, of Trenton, N.C.
The survivor is pilot David Sloan, 26, of Cinquapin, N.C., Brown
said.
   Jack Barker of the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta
said the Nomad 24 cargo plane attempted an instrument landing, but
reported a missed approach.
   After the pilot turned back, the plane stalled and crashed about
7:30 a.m.
   Brenda Coffey of the county emergency services office said the
plane crashed on a runway and caught fire.

   Indian security forces killed seven
suspected Moslem militants as they crossed from Pakistan into India
today in violence that left at least nine people dead in
Jammu-Kashmir state, police and witnesses said.
   Indian news reports said 13 people died but the conflicting
numbers could not immediately be reconciled.
   Militants and security forces clashed throughout the day in
Srinagar, the capital of the state, and at least 10 people were
wounded, witnesses said.
   The firefight occurred in the Ori sector, 93 miles north of
Srinagar, security sources said. Indian troops killed seven men on
the spot and wounded two others as they passed into India, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Troops captured five AK-47 automatic weapons, one rocket
launcher, three anti-personnel mines and other weapons, they said.
   India accuses Pakistan of providing weapons and training to
Moslem separatists in Kashmir. Pakistan denies the charge and
accuses India of trying to crush a movement for self-determination.
   In Srinagar, a shootout between Moslem militants and security
forces near a bazaar killed one police officer, Chief Constable Ali
Mohamed. News reports said security forces killed a suspected
militant during a village raid in the southern part of the state.
   The deaths brought to at least 326 the number of people killed
since Jan. 20 when the Indian government began the crackdown on the
separatist movement in the strategic state.
   Today's clashes in Srinagar included several bomb blasts.
   The crisis over Kashmir has heightened long-standing animosity
between India and Pakistan.
   Both countries claim the mountainous region, which is split
between them along a contested frontier where Indian and Pakistani
troops face each other. The dispute flared into war in 1948 and
1965.
   On Thursday, a powerful right-wing Indian political party urged
India's army to attack the alleged bases in Pakistan to ``clean out
the terrorists.''
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
About 64 percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslems.
Nationwide Moslems comprise only 12 percent of India's population
of 880 million, while Hindus make up 82 percent.
   Meanwhile, 15 Sikh extremists impersonating government troops
lured six Hindu men out of their homes in an remote Punjab village
and shot them to death, a senior police official said today.
   The gunmen wore uniforms of the paramilitary Border Security
Force when they arrived in Kotli Suratmallian. All 15 escaped,
authorities said.

   About 15 members of the French
bullfighters' union occupied a chamber at Nimes City Hall on
Friday, protesting that Spaniards were getting too many of the jobs
at an upcoming bullfight festival.
   The sit-in began Thursday evening and was still in progress at
midday Friday. The protesters demanded a meeting with the director
of the city's stadiums, Simon Casas. Casas is the former president
of the bullfighters' union and now administers the bullfight
programs.
   According to the protesters, French bullfighters were given only
two of about 30 jobs at the upcoming Pentecost festival, which is
to consist of 13 separate bullfight programs between May 27 and
June 4.
   The festival has drawn about 400,000 visitors annually in recent
years.

<HEAD>Mayor Punishes University Because of Professor's Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor has provoked a debate over
academic freedom by refusing to give a new building to a university
because one of its teachers questioned the existence of Nazi gas
chambers.
   The professor, Bernard Notin, was suspended from teaching law
courses in March but continues to teach economics at state-funded
Jean Moulin University, named for the Lyon-based leader of the
French Resistance.
   Notin's suspension came after an anti-racism organization filed
a complaint regarding an article he wrote that challenged widely
accepted accounts of the Holocaust.
   Mayor Michel Noir told reporters Thursday his refusal to
transfer a publicly owned building to the university for new
classroom space did not constitute interference in campus affairs.
He said he merely wanted the university council to follow
regulations which call for it to ``convene and deliberate'' if a
teacher poses serious problems for the university.
   Noir said last weekend it was ``out of the question'' the city
would provide new facilities to the university ``if Notin and other
falsifiers of history continue to teach there.''
   Notin has insisted on his right to freedom of opinion and said
he has not used the classroom as a forum for his controversial
views.
   The president of the university, Pierre Vialle, issued a
communique saying the school as a whole should not have to bear
responsibility for a controversy involving an individual.
   Noir, a member of the center-right Rally for the Republic party,
was praised by a local leader of the governing Socialist party,
Jean-Jack Queyranne.
   ``The freedom of research and expression at universities cannot
serve as an alibi for those who insult the history and the memory
of our people,'' Queyranne said.
   Bruno Gollnisch, a deputy for the extreme-right National Front
in the European Parliament, said his party did not endorse Notin's
views but was concerned about Noir's reprisal.
   ``If the revisionists are wrong, which is very possible, it
nonetheless seems that one is less and less free to speak about all
aspects of World War II,'' Gollnisch said.

   A canal was the last barrier today separating the
sprawling Big Cypress National Wildlife Preserve from a 25,000-acre
Everglades fires that had already jumped one waterway, fire
officials said.
   Crews concentrated on keeping the 4-mile-wide line of fire from
crossing the L-67 levee and sweeping into the drought-parched
preserve west of Miami.
   ``We have the potential of this burning into Big Cypress and
some critcal land out here, some nice trees, and that could cause a
problem,'' said state forest ranger Jim Taylor.
   The fire leaped across the L-67 canal Thursday but was pushed
back.
   ``It did jump, but then we managed to get a helicopter out there
and dump a couple of buckets of water on it,'' state Division of
Forestry duty officer Peter Karayeanes said. ``We managed to put
that one out and we just have the fire on the east side of the L-67
levee.''
   L-67 is part of the statewide canal system built early in the
century to drain off swamplands in southern Florida.
   State ranger Gene Dempsey said crews started backfires today to
make sure the blaze stayed on the east side of the canal. Calmer
winds late Thursday allowed them to take the night off. But
firefighters were still concerned about the preserve.
   ``We feel very confident that we can keep the fire from going
over the levee. We did it yesterday, and I think we can do it
again.''
   He said there are very few animals affected by the fire.
Alligators are in the canals, and all other large animals such as
deer and the endangered Florida panther have been living by water
because of the severe drought.
   ``We have a few snakes and rodents scurrying away, but that's
about it.''
   The blaze, one of three outside Miami, did not threaten any
inhabited areas.
   Another fire, in Everglades National Park about 27 miles
southwest of the city, scorched 10,500 acres by late Thursday
afternoon.
   Firefighters were confident they could control it, said park
spokeswoman Darlene Koontz. Investigators determined the Everglades
fire was man-made.
   ``With the conditions that we have out there, with the ecosystem
in somewhat stress, we just really want to encourage people to be
careful with fire,'' Koontz said.
   Seminole Indian firefighters spent Thursday battling a smaller
blaze on their reservation in Broward County. After burning 800
acres, that fire appeared contained, Dempsey said.
   Fires are a normal part of the Everglades ecology, said park
spokeswoman Pat Tolle, but this this year's fires worry
environmentalists because the region's 20-month drought has left
the region extremely dry. And the state is undergoing a heatwave.
   Normal high temperatures for this time of year in the Tampa Bay
area are around 85 degrees. But temperatures hovered at 93 there
Thursday and forecasters predicted highs to stay in the 90s at
least through the weekend.
   Florida Power Corp. has called on its 1.1 million customers to
conserve energy.
   ``We want everyone to understand that it's tight,'' utility
spokesman Ray Blush said Thursday in St. Petersburg. The utility
serves parts of the Gulf Coast and central Florida.
   Gov. Bob Martinez asked electric customers statewide to set
thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and take other conservation
steps to avoid the blackouts that affected much of Florida over
Christmas.

   Latvia's parliament adopted a declaration
of independence today, launching the Baltic republic's secession
from the Soviet Union 50 years after it was forcibly absorbed by
Moscow.
   The Supreme Soviet voted 138-0, with one abstention, to pass the
measure, which calls for independence after an undetermined
transition period. Fifty-seven anti-independence deputies refused
to vote.
   When the results of the vote were announced via loudspeakers to
a crowd of several hundred people outside parliament, a loud cheer
went up.
   Then, those inside and outside the hall began singing ``God
Bless Latvia,'' the republic's national anthem.
   The measure that made Latvia the last of the three Baltic
republics to formally break with Moscow had needed a two-thirds
majority, or 132 votes, to pass.
   The neighboring republic of Estonia has taken a similar step.
The third Baltic republic, Lithuania, declared full independence on
March 11, and the Kremlin since has imposed an economic blockade on
the republic.
   The deputies also voted to drop the words ``Soviet Socialist''
from the republic's name, making it simply ``The Republic of
Latvia.''
   Two deputies walked out of the session during the vote,
including Alfreds Rubiks, Latvia's Communist Party chief who
earlier in the day had warned of mass demonstrations and strikes by
non-Latvians if the measure had passed.
   As the time for the vote approached, young girls in gold
headbands and bright pink skirts sang Latvian folk songs outside
the Supreme Soviet building beneath red and white Latvian flags
held aloft by pro-independence demonstrators.
   The Supreme Soviet, or parliament, put the independence
declaration on the agenda despite complaints by some deputies that
they were being rushed into a dangerous decision. The parliament is
dominated by the grassroots Latvian People's Front.
   Members of the Latvian opposition complained they first saw the
draft declaration only this morning.
   ``We are physically unable to give an answer today on this
document,'' Sergejs Diemans told fellow legislators. ``Time must be
taken to study it carefully.''
   Deputy Leonids Alksnis warned that if the declaration passed, as
expected, Moscow would apply heavy pressure on Latvia to rescind it.
   ``If we pass this declaration, Moscow will do the same thing to
Latvia'' as it did to Lithuania, Alksnis said.
   Other deputies objected that Latvians had wanted to restore
their independence for 50 years. In the end, the lawmakers voted
139-56 to address the measure today.
   ``This is our last possibility to survive, and we are going to
take advantage of it. That is why we demand independence,'' said
writer Alberts Bels.
   Scores of protesters from the non-Latvian population gathered on
Cathedral Square with signs demanding the republic not copy
Lithuania. A pro-independence rally was scheduled for later in the
day.
   Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis advised his neighbors
Thursday on a visit to Riga to ``be strong and have courage.''
   He said Latvians, if they moved more slowly than Lithuania on
the path to secession, would be ``trudging through a jungle.''
   However, Latvia's ethnic balance is more delicate than
Lithuania's and could slow steps toward independence.
   In Lithuania, 80 percent of the 2.8 million people are ethnic
Lithuanian, but about 54 percent of Latvia's population of 2.7
million people are Latvian. Most of the rest are ethnic Russians,
many of whom oppose independence.
   In the past year, Latvia has copied within months, and sometimes
weeks, Lithuania's steps toward independnce.
   In December, it abolished the Communist Party's guaranteed
monopoly on power; in February it condemned the 1940 act that
formalized its annexation by the Soviet Union; and last month a
large segment of its Communist Party broke from the Moscow-based
Soviet party.
   Anatoly Gorbunov, who was re-elected president of Latvia during
the parliamentary session, backed independence in a nomination
speech Thursday.
   ``I believe that the renewal of a legally sovereign nation must
be accomplished,'' he said, declaring it a ``normal way of life for
all the residents of Latvia.''
   Gorbunov, a 48-year-old former Communist Party functionary
skilled at negotiating with Moscow, won 153 votes out of 196 cast.

   The man with the two boxes of trash bags looked
out of place amid the models in cocktail dresses, the stack of
truck tires and the tie-dyed salespeople from The World's No. 1
Jewelry Company Serving The Sanitation Industry.
   ``I'm not trying to sell Cinch-Saks,'' Thomas W. Higgins
confided. ``I'm trying to sell an idea.''
   Higgins' idea _ clear Hefty Cinch-Saks _ might seem a trifle
mundane. But last month's Earth Day somehow has Americans excited
about a mundane task _ throwing out trash.
   And that has people very excited at Waste Expo '90, the annual
convention of the National Solid Wastes Management Association.
   More than 10,000 people are at the Georgia World Congress
Center, attending seminars _ like ``Women In Waste'' and ``Backyard
Basics: How Composting Can Improve Your Bottom Line.''
   They're looking over the latest new gee-gaws for their industry,
including the Cram-A-Lot Compactor Sentry System, computer software
and recycler-friendly garbage trucks.
   (Garbage trucks, it should be noted, look mighty strange when
they are (a) clean and (b) surrounded by models in cocktail
dresses.)
   ``If we have another Earth Day, everybody's going to be doing
this,'' said Jerry Andregg, standing next to the Kann Curb Sorter
garbage truck, a fancy white job with four compartments for four
different kinds of garbage and a plastic masher in the middle.
   ``It's helped our business out,'' he said, ``it'' being Earth
Day. ``And it's raised people's awareness _ how important it is to
start recycling.''
   ``The awareness here is nothing but recycling,'' said Doug McGee
of Plastican.
   You know those big buckets that joint compound and
school-cafeteria mayonnaise come in? Well, with color-coding, a
hole for rainwater to drain out of and a snazzy logo on the front,
Plastican makes them into bins for household recyclables.
   ``Everyone wants to do it,'' McGee said, ``it'' being recycling.
``But everyone's trying to figure out how to do it.''
   That's what the guy with the Cinch-Saks figures.
   ``The most effective way to run a co-mingled curbside recycling
program is to pick up the material in a clear bag,'' said Higgins,
manager of Hefty Recycling Opportunities for the Mobil Chemical
Co.'s Consumer Products Division.
   The idea, he explained, is that homeowners don't want 17
recycling bins cluttering up the garage, and cities don't want to
pay the garbageman to dawdle at the curb, putting the brown beer
bottles in one place, the clear juice bottles in another place and
the newspapers in a third place.
   The answer: the clear garbage bag.
   Maybe, um, a clear Hefty Cinch-Sak?
   ``It's up to our marketing guys to get their share of the
market,'' Higgins said.
   Over at the Dempster display (``a Waste-Quip company''), John L.
Thomas, vice president for sales, is showing off the Recycle One, a
gleaming white garbage truck with a side-loading window-box gizmo
that dumps different kinds of garbage in the correct place in the
truck.
   ``Earth Day has really brought it into focus,'' Thomas said,
adding that recycling ``is the answer to our disposables problem.''
   ``So many of our landfills are filling up,'' he said. ``We're
running out of landfill space. One way to extend landfill life is
to put less in them.''
   Dempster and the other exhibitors at Waste Expo '90 have their
biggest ever audience to pitch to; the convention's attendance of
10,000-plus is a record for the show.
   Some of them may need a few garbage trucks; others may need
office trash cans or shredding machines.
   But Saul Brett Inc. wants to sell something to all of them.
   ``We're the only company with 14-karat jewelry for sanitation,
from $115 to $5,000 _ in stock!'' said Jimmy Brett, who's hawking
stuff while Saul's back in New York minding the store.
   The Brett company makes decals for garbage cans and garbage
trucks. They've plastered the convention with signs and buttons
bearing the ``DRUGS ARE GARBAGE'' message the company believes in.
   They make gold-colored garbage-can tie tacks. They even make
some spiffy gold-and-diamond garbage-truck pins for the valued
sanitation employee, or the supportive sanitation spouse.
   ``No one,'' Jimmy said, ``does it like we do.''

   Thousands gathered solemnly in the rain today
to hear calls for peace and reconciliation at the dedication of a
memorial to four students killed in an anti-war protest 20 years
ago at Kent State University.
   ``We do appreciate what has been done and who did it,'' said
Florence Schroeder, mother of Bill Schroeder, one of the four
students killed on by Ohio National Guardsmen on May 4, 1970.
   Mrs. Schroeder said she was convinced the death of her son and
three other students helped to shorten the Vietnam War by
increasing public opposition to American involvement in it.
   ``He absolutely did not die in vain,'' Mrs. Schroeder said at a
news conference.
   Despite a steady rain, some 4,000 gathered for the midday
dedication, according to a crowd estimate by Kent State Police
Chief John Peach. Many Kent State students were not even born when
the killings occurred.
   Gov. Richard Celeste said the 1970 shootings should serve as a
source of learning rather than as a focus of bitterness.
   ``To those who suffered from that tragedy 20 years ago, I am
sorry,'' Celeste said. ``It's time to turn the tragedy at Kent
State of May 4, 1970, into a calling to peacemakers.''
   The $100,000 granite memorial is the most ambitious attempt by
the university to commemorate the dead and wounded. But about 200
student activists who wanted a larger memorial built and more
student involvement in its planning waged a silent protest march
during the dedication.
   The protesting students stood near the white tent, where
ceremony participants spoke. Some of the students held up their
arms, fists clenched or displaying the peace sign, and many others
held up handmade signs reading ``Whose May 4th is it anyway?'' and
``Don't minimize student death.''
   Thursday evening, some 2,000 people attended a candlelight
ceremony to mark the deaths of Schroeder, Jeffrey Miller, Sandy
Scheuer and Allison Krause. Nine other people were wounded in the
shootings.
   Former Sen. George McGovern, keynote speaker at the dedication,
called the incident ``the most tragic episode in American foreign
policy history.''
   The 1972 Democratic presidential candidate, who ran
unsuccessfully against then-President Richard Nixon, said before
the ceremony that the Kent State shootings and the death of two
Jackson State University students in Mississippi 10 days later
helped focus public attention on the war and opposition to it. He
said the deaths touched ``a common note of humanity.''
   At the dedication, McGovern called for U.S. reconciliation with
Vietnam and the re-establishment of diplomatic ties.
   ``The war in Vietnam is unfinished,'' he said. ``The killing has
stopped but the arrogance that produced it survives and so does the
agony, the guilt and the separation.''
   Until now, the shootings were marked only by a gravestone-size
slab erected in 1971 in a corner of a parking lot where the tragedy
occurred.
   The lack of a memorial reflected continuing political
differences over an event that brought the Vietnam War home.
   Some viewed the shootings as an unprovoked act of state
violence; others said unpatriotic protesters had finally gotten
what was coming to them, although many of the victims were
bystanders rather than activists.
   Campus police said they would maintain a discreet presence at
the hilltop memorial site to keep order, but did not expect a
disruption.
   To mark the anniversary of the shootings, a 12-hour candlelight
vigil, an annual tradition, began at midnight on this 824-acre
campus of 23,000 students. The vigil followed a cross-campus
candlelight march by more than 2,000 people, most of them students.
   Hundreds of students milled around the scene.
   At each spot in a parking lot where a student died, a student
stood this morning, roped off and encircled with candles.
   Kent State freshman Michelle Suttman of Madison said the
reaction on campus to the anniversary was mixed.
   ``There's been a lot of indifference,'' she said. ``This is
finals week.''
   University President Michael Schwartz went to Kent State
trustees with a proposal for a memorial eight years ago. Earlier
suggestions for a memorial never got off the ground, university
spokeswoman Janet Thiede said.
   Some veterans groups objected to the idea of a memorial and some
people felt the smaller marker and the university's peace studies
center were sufficient commemoration.
   The university originally said it would build a larger memorial
but scaled back the plan when it failed to raise $1 million it
needed.
   Some students and survivors complained the university's
fund-raising effort was halfhearted. Student critics said
university officials were not interested in calling attention to
the shootings.
   Last month the university announced creation of four full-time
scholarships in the names of the four dead students.
   The memorial was designed by Bruno Ast, a Chicago architect who
was selected in a competition. Ast designed the memorial without
calling for the names of the victims to be included, but he said he
had no objections to last week's decision by the university to add
a separate square granite slab with the names.
   The lack of the victims' names on the memorial had been a
persistent sore point among students and survivors who wanted a
more elaborate memorial.
   The anniversary didn't interest all segments of this campus
community 40 miles southeast of Cleveland.
   ``They are not letting old wounds heal,'' senior Chuck Bulick of
Mentor said Thursday.
   He called the shootings ``unfortunate, terrible,'' but said he
also had read that student demonstrators had been unruly and had
thrown rocks at Guardsmen called to restore order after fire
destroyed an ROTC building.
   Most students' accounts of the shootings said the National
Guardsmen, sent in by then-Gov. James A. Rhodes, were not
threatened by the protesters when they opened fire.

   Falling scenery, curtains that won't go up and
revolving stages that refuse to turn have caused a series of
mishaps in London theaters in the last 10 days, prompting a safety
investigation.
   The latest incident occurred Thursday night at a gala opening at
the Royalty Theater of ``A Clockwork Orange.'' The curtain refused
to go up for the second half of the Royal Shakespeare Company
production.
   The star-studded audience downed free drinks offered by the
embarrassed management as stage staff struggled for 15 minutes
before getting the curtain to go up.
   On Monday, the Stephen Sondheim musical ``Sunday in the Park
with George'' at the Lyttelton Theater was halted in
mid-performance when a wooden tree, part of the scenery, fell from
a hook as it was being carried off the stage.
   It narrowly missed an actor.
   Performances at the Lyttelton were canceled the next day.
   ``It is an extremely complicated set. It has simply been bad
luck, but we can take no chances,'' said a theater spokesman.
   It was the second mishap to hit the musical. On April 23, an
iron bar fell, but nobody was injured.
   On April 24, a hydraulic jack at the Olivier Theater broke down,
preventing the revolving stage from turning. The play ``The School
for Scandal'' was canceled in mid-performance when stage staff
failed to get it working again. The comedy was playing to a packed
house. Tickets were refunded.
   The actors' union Equity said in a statement this week that a
working party comprising representatives of the union, stage staff
and theater managers had been set up to investigate safety on stage
as a result of the incidents.

   CTK said the city council also ordered the removal of a statue

   Marvin Cantor is a victim of German
unification.
   Cantor's architectural firm spent two years designing plans to
build a Washington embassy for East Germany. As he was drawing the
last walls, the first crack was made in the Berlin Wall.
   East Germany, rapidly advancing toward union with its neighbor
to the west, soon will cease to exist. Without a country, who needs
an embassy?
   West Germany has a sprawling embassy on a verdant hill in
northwest Washington. The East Germans have occupied one floor of
an office building on the city's Embassy Row since establishing
diplomatic relations with the United States in 1974.
   But the East Germans always viewed their quarters as temporary
and sought an embassy building befitting their position as the nub
of the Warsaw Pact and a major economic power in the Soviet bloc.
   In the early 1980s, the East Germans leased a lot in a planned
complex of some two dozen embassies on International Drive, where
several governments _ including Ghana and Israel _ already have
moved.
   After another period of inactivity, East Germany commissioned
Cantor's firm in early 1988 to design the new embassy offices, or
chancery building as it's known in diplomatic parlance.
   Cantor completed the blueprints late last year. The East Germans
were pleased, he said.
   The building would cost $6 million to $8 million to build and
would occupy about 45,000 square feet.
   A full political union of the two Germanys is expected next
year, but the sisters already have agreed on a treaty merging their
economies.
   In a sign of things to come in Washington, the two embassies _
once separated by several miles of real estate and four decades of
rival ideologies _ will hold their first joint function Monday with
a screening of a television documentary on composer Johann
Sebastian Bach.
   The final decision on the fate of the embassy project is still
before the newly elected non-Communist government _ the first, and
probably last, East Germans will know.
   ``It has to be reviewed,'' said Peter Janz, first secretary of
the East German embassy. He said a decision was expected soon.
   Cantor believes that once the new government resolves the myriad
pressing problems bedeviling the logistics of unification, it may
suggest to West Germany that his plans be modified for an annex or
consular section for the embassy of the unified Germany.
   ``Maybe that's just wishful thinking,'' he said.
   Either way, he has nothing to worry about.
   First, he expects to be paid.
   Second, for every country dropped from the U.S. diplomatic
roster, a new one is tacked on. Cantor could be commissioned to
build an embassy for Mongolia, which recently established
diplomatic relations with the United States.

   President Bush, calling for ``a new
Western strategy for new and changing times,'' said today he hopes
an agreement on reducing troops and conventional arms in Europe can
be signed this fall.
   Once such an agreement is reached, U.S.-Soviet talks should
begin as soon as possible, aimed at reducing the number of
short-range nuclear weapons stationed throughout Europe, Bush said
in prepared remarks for the Oklahoma State University commencement
ceremonies.
   On changes taking place within the Soviet Union, Bush said:
``President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev has made profound progress in
his country, reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned
back.''
   But, Bush added, ``neither can we turn the clock ahead, to know
for sure what kind of country the Soviet Union will be in years to
come.''
   Bush said that the Western alliance must plan for a
less-militarized Europe that plays down the current focus on
imminent war.
   ``We are entering a new age of freedom in a time of uncertainty,
but great hope,'' Bush said.
   Looking forward to the NATO meeting he proposed for early this
summer, Bush said: ``The alliance must join together to craft a new
Western strategy for new and changing times.''
   The U.S. role, he said, will be to support Europe militarily as
long as the allies want. However, in light of democratic changes
sweeping Eastern Europe, the political focus of NATO will increase
and the military aspects will be different, Bush said.
   ``If the Soviet withdrawal continues and our arms-control
efforts are successful, we must plan for a different kind of
military presence focused less on the danger of an immediate
outbreak of war,'' he said.
   He made the comments a day after announcing he is scrapping
plans for upgrading battlefield nuclear weapons that are stationed
mostly in West Germany. Bush said he wants NATO members to develop
objectives for new arms control talks on U.S. and Soviet reductions
of other short-range missiles.
   Bush, who in the past has only said that an agreement on
reducing conventional forces in Europe should be completed by the
35 nations with an interest in Europe by the end of this year,
today said he hoped it could be signed ``this fall.''
   Elaborating on his call Thursday for a complete review of NATO's
mission, Bush said he wants a June or July summit of alliance
members to:
   _Assess the future of U.S. nuclear forces in Europe.
   _Begin preparations for U.S. -Soviet Talks on reducing
short-range nuclear missiles.
   _Set objectives for follow-up negotiations once the treaty is
signed to reduce U.S. and Soviet conventional forces in Europe.
   _Develop NATO goals for the future of the 35-nation pact called
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Eastern European nations as well as members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``Our enemy today is uncertainty and instability,'' Bush said in
stating a continued need for NATO's military role.
   ``The alliance will need to maintain a sound collective military
structure with forces in the field backed by larger forces that can
be called upon in crises,'' he said.
   Uncertainty centers around the future of Soviet change and
motivation, including how Gorbachev handles the Lithuanian
breakaway move, he said.
   ``The only noble answer lies in the dialogue that results in
unencumbered self-determination for Lithuania,'' Bush said.
   The president told the Oklahoma students he would use a series
of commencement addresses this year to talk about democratic change
in the world.
   Bush on Thursday announced he was abandoning an upgrade of the
short-range Lance missile and cancelling plans to further modernize
nuclear artillery shells in Europe.
   ``As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return
home, there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest
ranges,'' the president said at a news conference Thursday.
   He also called for a summit meeting of the 16 NATO nations to
``launch a wide-ranging NATO strategy review for the transformed
Europe of the 1990s.''
   ``This summit should address first the future political mission
of the alliance, reaffirming its crucial role in managing and
stabilizing the transformation of Europe,'' he said.
   ``The revolutionary changes transforming Europe are moving us
from the postwar era to a new era in history beyond containment''
of Warsaw Pact forces, Bush said.
   Bush's announcement that he would not replace the 700 aging
Lance missiles with a more powerful version came in the face of
waning enthusiasm in Congress and Europe for the modernization.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher lauded the
president's announcement, saying, ``This shows the alliance takes
into account the changed conditions in their full totality.''
   Bush also told reporters that he sometimes worries about the
domestic staying power of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who
will visit Washington May 30-June 3 for a superpower summit.
   ``I do from time to time worry about a takeover that will set
back the whole process'' of reform in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, he said.

   Angry Mills College students blockaded
buildings today during a raucous demonstration one day after
trustees voted to admit undergraduate men at the exclusive women's
institution.
   Several hundred students took part in the blockade, surrounding
major buildings at the college, including the administration
building and the president's home.
   Trustees, faced with declining enrollment and revenues, voted
Thursday to accept men as undergraduates rather than dip heavily
into the school's $70 million endowment. They announced their
decision on Mills Common and were jeered by some students yelling
``Traitors!''
   During today's protest, some students parked cars in front of
campus buildings, honking horns and setting off car alarms in a bid
to disrupt classes.
   ``We're trying to shut down the operation of the college until
they reverse their decision,'' said Esther Barragan, a senior
economics major. ``We're not going to take this lightly.''
   The noisy demonstration brought Mary Metz, the school's
president, out of her home about 9 a.m. The students, with radios
at full blast, were shouting, ``We will not accept this!''
   Metz spoke with some students, agreeing to meet with them this
afternoon or on Saturday. However, she said, Thursday's decision by
the trustees to admit men would not be reversed.
   She acknowleged that the demonstration had disrupted classes and
school administration.
   Many women at Mills said they would not return next year because
of the trustees' vote, ending 138 years as a female enclave.
Current undergraduate enrollment is about 775.
   ``I can't believe they would ignore us like that,'' Amy Hutto,
one of the undergraduates who shaved their heads in protest, said
Thursday. ``I haven't gone to class all week because this was on my
mind. I'll strike now. I don't know if I ever want to go back.''
   Protesters, and some experts on women's education, said that
coeducational programs can exclude women from opportunities because
men tend to be more aggressive in the classroom.
   Trustees had been considering the move for more than a year.
   Enrollment in Mills' 33 undergraduate programs is down 4.2
percent from three years ago and more than 20 percent below the
1,000 students needed to balance the $24 million annual budget,
said economists at the school, where the tuition is almost $12,000.
Men are already admitted as graduate students.
   ``If Mills is to maintain academic quality and financial
strength in the long run, it must increase its undergraduate
enrollment to at least 1,000,'' board chairman Warren Hellman said,
amid screams that nearly drowned him out.
   ``The trustees believe coeducation will enable Mills' excellent
undergraduate academic program to reach more students,'' he said.
   Metz predicted that 20-30 men would enroll the first co-ed
semester. She said efforts would be made to let women continue
taking leadership roles and not be dominated by male students.
   At an off-campus news conference later, Hellman said 32 members
of the 35-member board took part in the vote and an ``overwhelming
majority'' were in favor of coeducation. About 60 percent of the
board members are women.
   Most teachers had opposed the plan to admit men to the college,
the only single-sex college in Northern California. Two women's
colleges are located in Southern California and there are 94
nationwide. There were 298 women's schools 30 years ago.
   ``The whole environment on a campus changes when men are
admitted, no matter how hard the school tries to prevent that,''
said Peter Mirijanian, director of communications for the Women's
College Coalition in Washington D.C. ``Male students are taken more
seriously and women suffer.''
   Wheaton College in Massachusetts went co-ed three years ago, and
a Harvard study last year showed men now dominate the classroom.
   Analysis of videotaped classes at Wheaton showed that men made
up 10 percent of the classroom but did a quarter of the speaking,
according to the study by Catherine Krupnick.
   ``You ask `What's the meaning of life?' and four hands will
shoot up, most of them male,'' she said. ``College catalogues
should carry warnings: The value you receive will depend on your
sex.''
   But at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, N.H., which decided
to go coeducational last year, spokesman Byron Champlin said less
than 10 percent of women interested in colleges look at women's
schools.
   Janette Robinson, 21, of Duxbury, Mass., who will graduate from
Colby-Sawyer this month and was among the most vocal coeducation
opponents last year, said accepting men wasn't such a bad idea
after all.
   ``The people who were strongly against it have already
graduated, so I think the men will be fairly well accepted on
campus,'' she said.

   A Chinese diplomat said Friday that he has
defected to the United States because he supports the pro-democracy
movement in China.
   ``Many democracy activists in China now are being persecuted and
arrested, and my situation would not be different,'' Xu Lin, who
dealt with Chinese students in the United States, said at a news
conference.
   Xu said his application for political asylum was ``in process.''
Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, declined to say whether an application had been received.
   Wu Zurong, first secretary in the press office at the Chinese
Embassy, said he was not familiar with the defection.
   Xu said at the news conference that he was the fifth person
connected with the Chinese Embassy here to defect since the June 4
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   Xu, who said he left the embassy Wednesday night, would not
disclose the whereabouts of his wife and daughter because he was
concerned for their safety.
   He said he was assigned to Washington for a four-year tour in
July 1988. In March, he said, he was told that his tenure would be
shortened by two years.
   He said he has supported the student movement by helping
students in the United States renew their passports and avoiding
reporting their activities to authorities.
   ``Since June 1989, one year after my arrival, China has stepped
backward into tragedy and totalitarian repression,'' Xu said.
``Today, the opportunity for reform does not exist.''
   Liu Yongchuan, president of the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars, praised Xu's action.
   ``His defection is to demonstrate that he has totally lost
confidence in the current Chinese government, and that he can no
longer tolerate to serve this regime,'' Liu said.
   ``We believe that Mr. Xu's action represents the wish of the
majority of Chinese government officials.''
   The student federation, based in Washington, was formed last
year to protect the rights of an estimated 40,000 Chinese students
in the United States. It also says it seeks to promote democracy in
China.
   Xu said 70 people had defected since the Tiananmen Square
crackdown.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today tried to convince the Soviet Union that a united Germany's
membership in NATO would not upset the delicate East-West balance
in Europe.
   Baker met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
who said he was pleased by U.S. plans to cancel new short-range
nuclear missile deployments in West Germany. Shevardnadze also said
he and Baker had a ``very constructive and useful conversation''
about arms control issues.
   But, Shevardnadze told reporters, they had not settled any of
their differences over restricting long-range nuclear missiles
during their 3{-hour session.
   Baker said: ``We'll just have to wait and see.'' He was
referring to the talks he was to hold with Shevardnadze on such
sticking points as air- and sea-launched cruise missles in Moscow
on May 16-19.
   Earlier in the day, Shevardnadze flatly ruled out NATO
membership for a united Germany.
   Baker met today with Chancellor Helmut Kohl before beginning his
talks with the Soviet Union over Germany's future and lagging arms
control talks.
   The Baker-Shevardnadze meeting came a day after the United
States announced it will not modernize short-range nuclear missiles
in Europe or deploy new ones. The Western allies announced they
will meet in London in late June and hold a 35-nation summit,
including the Soviet Union, by the end of the year in Paris.
   Baker also offered to consider withdrawing some of the
short-range Lance missiles now based in West Germany if the Soviets
drop their objections to NATO membership for a united Germany.
   In comment late Thursday in Tass, Vladimir Bogachev, the
official Soviet news agency's military analyst, said: ``Let us hope
that, accepting in principle the Soviet proposal for talks on
tactical nuclear weapons and suspending modernization of Lance
missiles and nuclear artillery, Washington does not at the same
time intend to give a go-ahead for the deployment of more dangerous
air-based nuclear missiles in Europe.''
   New U.S. air-to-ground missiles, if mounted on tactical aircraft
such as the F-111B fighter-bomber, would be capable of striking
targets well inside Soviet borders, Bogachev wrote.
   Shevardnadze called the U.S. arms-reduction announcement a
``good decision,'' but also noted that the Soviets were the first
to propose eliminating short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``We had proposed it a long time ago and offered it,'' he said.
``We have already almost completely destroyed this class of
rockets.''
   Behind Thursday's decisions is a determination by the allies to
respond to the historic political change sweeping Europe and
finding a new role for NATO after 31 years of eyeing the Red Army
suspiciously over an East-West divide that is now melting away.
   But the 35-nation summit depends on completion of a treaty to
reduce troops, tanks, airplanes, helicopters and artillery in
Europe. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner on Thursday accused
the Soviets of ``foot-dragging'' in the negotiations in Vienna.
   Baker, meanwhile, said at a separate news conference in Brussels
Thursday that ``the negotiations have not proceeded as rapidly as
we would have thought,'' but deferred making a judgment until he
saw Shevardnadze later today.
   Baker arrived in Bonn today and met with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Kohl. Shevardnadze also met
with Kohl, just minutes after Baker departed. No details were
immediately available.
   Baker's meeting with Shevardnadze was expected to focus
primarily on arms control and be followed by more intensive talks
in mid-May in the Soviet Union. By then, Baker said, ``we'll know a
lot more.''
   The talks also hold the key to how President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will address reducing armories
during their summit beginning May 30 in Washington.
   Another projected treaty to set limits on long-range nuclear
missiles, bombers and submarines is also running into obstacles at
the negotiating table in Geneva. Bush and Gorbachev would like to
at least initial a framework agreement on key issues, but officials
on both sides are skeptical of meeting the deadline.
   Baker and Shevardnadze will meet again Saturday with the foreign
ministers of Britain, France and the two German nations to discuss
one of the trickiest obstacles to creating a united Germany _
figuring out how to keep it from disrupting the European balance of
power.
   There are widespread concerns in Europe that a stronger Germany
could again pose a threat to countries overrun during the two world
wars.
   The Soviet Union has consistently ruled out NATO membership for
a united Germany.
   ``We consider a unified Germany as an important factor of
stability and peace in Europe,'' Shevardnadze said today. ``For
such a giant to belong to one bloc, one alliance ... will not
create conditions for stability.''
   The Soviets have called for a neutral Germany.
   The United States and its NATO partners view membership in the
alliance as the best insurance policy. At their meeting Thursday,
they agreed Germany would not have nuclear or chemical weapons and
insisted that a united Germany belongs in NATO.
   In a move that appeared aimed at allaying Soviet security
concerns, the foreign ministers supported allowing Soviet troops to
remain in East Germany after unification during a transition period.
   Until now, East Germany has served both as a loyal Soviet
military ally and a buffer against U.S. nuclear missiles and troops
in West Germany.

   New York City's health and consumer chiefs urged
lawmakers to ban cigarette machines.
   Health Commissioner Woodrow A. Myers Jr. and Consumer Affairs
Commissioner Mark Green spoke at a City Council committee hearing
Thursday on two bills designed to keep children away from tobacco.
   One bill would prohibit free distribution of cigarettes in the
city; the second would ban cigarette machines from places where
minors might have easy access to them.
   Melinda Sidak of the Tobacco Institute told the hearing her
trade association considers smoking ``an adult practice.''
   But she opposed the bills, saying 80 percent of vending machines
are already in places inaccessible to children, such as industrial
plants, bars and cocktail lounges.
   She said the industry opposes giving free cigarettes to people
under 21, but noted that the bill would prohibit free samples to
adults as well.
   Since October, at least 20 Minnesota cities have prohibited or
restricted the machines. And a measure pending in Congress would
ban them in any location accessible to people under 18.

<TEXT>
   Seven years after it began gobbling
homes, creeping lava from the Kilauea Volcano cut through the heart
of this beach town today, threatening the general store and forcing
congregants to move a church.
   A swift-moving finger of lava barely bypassed the Kalapana Store
and Drive-In and came to within little more than 100 yards of the
Star of the Sea Church before it was loaded onto a flatbed truck
for transfer to a safer place.
   Workers had to use a bulldozer to raise a corner of the
foundation after the historic church, known as the ``painted
church'' because of the brightly colored murals inside, refused to
budge.
   County civil defense chief Harry Kim said the church would be
taken a mile out of town, where homes evacuated from Kalapana sit.
Church officials have yet to decide where to relocate the church.
   Earlier, he had said that efforts to move the church were
delayed because authorities were busy tending to three homes full
of belongings that the lava unexpectedly cut off.
   Civil defense officials kept worried and grieving residents at a
safe distance today. The officials had sealed off the community
Thursday as the lava flow headed directly for the center of town.
   ``It is a community coming to death,'' the church's Sister Mary
Helen said. ``The immediate loss is a loss of community. Something
we've loved all through the years is going.''
   At the heart of the community since 1963 was the store and
drive-in owned by 82-year-old Walter Yamaguchi, who cleaned off
shelves and stopped serving hot foods under an order to close.
   Jim Halpin, who lived in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision for
nearly six years and watched his home destroyed last week, said he
would move back as soon as officials let people return, something
that could take years because the lava has to cool.
   He stopped at Yamaguchi's store to say goodbye.
   ``Walter's like everybody's uncle,'' he said. ``I came to say
goodbye and get that last container of chocolate milk.''
   Two homes were destroyed Thursday, bringing to 131 the number
burned since Kilauea started its present eruption Jan. 3, 1983. No
more homes were destroyed by the unpredictable flow by early today.
   George Hook, owner of a construction company that offered to
relocate the church for free, said it will be taken to a clearing
just outside of town and remain there until church officials decide
on a new location.
   Members of another church, Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational
Church, across from Star of the Sea, voted not to relocate, saying
to do so would nullify their faith in God.
   ``If we move it, it will defeat the whole purpose of our
Christian faith,'' said Bernice McKeague, church moderator. ``Our
people will be here to watch it go. This tiny church is a witness
to the world because the foundation is strong and we stand on that
foundation.''
   This morning lava was abutting a rock wall surrounding the
church, and authorities told the congregation they could not go
inside. ``The book is closed. We open a new book today,'' McKeague
said.

   Seven of 18 senior Army ROTC cadets at
Oklahoma State University cheated on an examination, but still will
be commissioned, officials said.
   Four of the seven will graduate today at ceremonies addressed by
President Bush, according to Lt. Col. Conrad McHugh, head of the
university's Department of Military Science. The four will be
commissioned at ceremonies later in the day that Bush won't attend.
   McHugh said three of the seven cadets still have some college
requirements to meet before graduation and commissioning.
   ``The seven are being given an administrative letter of
reprimand that goes in their official file,'' McHugh said.
   McHugh said the decision by the commanding general of the 3rd
Army ROTC region to allow the students who cheated to be
commissioned was ``even-handed.''
   He declined to release the cadets' names.
   The investigation began about 10 days after a March 20 test on
the military justice system when a cadet said there had been
cheating. The one-hour test had been unmonitored, as is normal
under the seniors' honor code.
   A three-day closed hearing weeded out the cheaters, McHugh said.
   ``They have the right to decline to testify, but everyone came
forward and talked,'' McHugh said.
   McHugh said after commissioning, some of the cadets will go into
the U.S. Army, the Army Reserve, the Army National Guard.

   A penny saved may be a penny earned,
but Gary Wagner only earned time in jail when he tried to use
pennies to pay a $441 fine. He spent three hours in the Wood County
Jail for contempt.
   County Magistrate Charles ``Ed'' Plum levied the fine early this
year after Wagner pleaded guilty to battery after shoving a
neighbor. Monday was his deadline for paying the fine, and he
showed up lugging 12 canvas bags filled with pennies.
   The magistrate on duty, Margaret Monroe, told Wagner he had to
collect the pennies into rolls of 50.
   After they argued awhile, Monroe called Plum into the courtroom,
and he told Wagner the same thing. When Wagner again refused, Plum
cited him for contempt and fined him $150.
   Wagner, 33, refused a third request to put the pennies into
rolls. Plum hit him with a 10-day jail term, saying it would give
him time to wrap up the change.
   Wagner's parents paid the $441 three hours after he was jailed.
Plum dropped the contempt charge and additional fine.

   East Germans on Sunday will vote in local
elections that likely will remove vestiges of Communist control and
virtually complete the revolution that began a year ago.
   The balloting will turn over to local hands the obedient
bureaucracies that were carefully controlled by the former
Stalinist leadership.
   ``Now must the self-reliance of the communities be realized,''
said Wolfgang Berghofer, the mayor of Dresden and a former
Communist who is seeking to retain his post.
   The balloting also may provide a gauge of the current mood
toward German unification, a process that is speeding toward
completion.
   There have been widespread protests in recent weeks by workers
afraid that their factories will close when forced to compete with
Western commerce.
   Experts met in East Berlin on Friday to continue talks on
merging the economies of the German states, and the superpowers
prepared for talks Saturday in the West German capital on the
international implications of a united Germany.
   The elections will probably mean the end of work for hundreds of
former Communists still holding power on the local level.
   ``It's similar to the old de-Nazification campaign after the
war,'' said Heinrich Vogel, a political analyst with the West
German Institute for Eastern and International Studies in Cologne,
West Germany. ``This is going to be a long-standing moral issue
with this society.''
   While elected leaders may be thrown out, Vogel said Friday that
many of the bureaucrats running city departments may be retained.
Many cannot be replaced because of their knowledge, he said.
   The local balloting follows the country's first free national
elections on March 18 and will complete a cycle that began a year
ago.
   The last local elections were held May 7, 1989, when the
Communist leaders claimed that nearly 99 percent of the voters
chose candidates from Communist-approved parties.
   The small protests that traditionally followed such results did
not end as in past years and instead evolved into the popular
revolt that exploded in mass demonstrations in October. The rallies
led to the fall of four decades of hard-line socialism and the
opening of the Berlin Wall in November.
   Now, the retooled and renamed Communist party is having trouble
finding candidates to compete in the elections. Near the cities of
Erfurt and Dresden, there are no candidates.
   The Communist party, now called the Party of Democratic
Socialism, still finished third in the national elections and is
likely to do well in East Berlin, a stronghold of support.
   ``It takes enormous bravery to run as a candidate for the PDS,''
said party leader Gregor Gysi.
   Candidates for the conservative Christian Democratic Union of
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, and the left-leaning Social
Democrats, are likely to capture most local posts.
   Although the Social Democrats have joined de Maiziere's broad
governing coalition, they favor more social guarantees to protect
East Germans from skyrocketing prices and the loss of subsidized
housing and food.
   More than 12 million voters in 7,800 cities, districts and other
municipalities are eligible to vote in the elections. Candidate
lists in many communities are huge and run the gamut.
   Sixty-two parties and more than a quarter-million candidates are
registered to run. In the city of Rostock, 20 candidates from the
German Beer Drinkers Party alone are seeking election to the city
council.
   Perhaps the most interesting elections are in Leipzig, where the
protests against Communism began last year.
   In a true precursor to a united Germany, the Social Democrat
candidate for mayor, Hinnrich-Lehman Gruber, has been allowed to
run even though he is a city council member in the West German city
of Hanover.

   A businessman has been convicted of making an
illegal donation designed to aid the 1986 re-election campaign of
Sen. Alan Cranston.
   Michael Goland, 43, also was acquitted Thursday on four
misdemeanor counts of conspiracy and making false statements. The
jury deadlocked on a felony charge of making a false statement.
   ``I am pleased for the acquittal,'' Goland said outside court.
``I'm incredibly upset for the one I was found guilty on.''
   U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew set sentencing for July 16.
Goland, whose first trial ended in a deadlocked jury last July,
could receive up to one year in jail and $360,000 in fines.
   Goland was convicted of secretly paying $120,000 for a
television advertisement for Senate candidate Edward B. Vallen of
the American Independent Party. Prosecutors said the effort was
part of an eleventh-hour campaign designed to divert votes from
Cranston's Republican opponent, Rep. Ed Zschau.
   The California Democrat won the election with 3,646,672 votes,
or 49.29 percent. Zschau received 3,541,804 votes, or 47.87 percent.
   The contribution was illegal because the television commercial
it produced falsely claimed at the end that it was financed by the
Vallen for Senate Committee. No such committee existed.
   Goland insisted that an aide failed to fix the discrepancy, and
he was not aware of it.
   No evidence was presented at trial that showed Cranston knew of
the 1986 plan. The senator also was not implicated in election law
violation charges brought against Goland.
   Goland is a supporter of Israel and had backed Cranston because
of the senator's record of support for that country.

   Entertainer Olivia Newton-John decided to
throw a little dirt of her own to counter neighborhood complaints
that the 6,000-square-foot mansion she is building in Malibu
constitutes an environmental disaster.
   ``Dirt and garbage have never been dumped on the beach or in the
ocean,'' the singer said Thursday in a statement. ``Any materials
that were temporarily placed during construction were native to the
beach, i.e. sand.''
   Neighbors suing Newton-John and her husband, Matt Lattanzi,
claim that trees and plants have been ripped out and beach cliffs
destroyed to make room for the $2 million estate.
   ``This la an environmental tragedy because trees
died for the paper that was used to spread false accusations
against me,'' said Newton-John, the Australian-born entertainer who
serves as the United Nations' goodwiwsuit representsll ambassador for the
environment.
   Residents who live along the Malibu coastline, however, charge
that Newton-John's construction crews have dumped tons of dirt into
the ocean and turned the water's edge a murky brown.

   The visiting prime minister of Lithuania
criticized President Bush today for doing nothing more than calling
for ``good faith'' negotiations in her country's independence
showdown with the Soviet Union.
   ``Simply making statements that there should be cooperation and
urging Lithuania to sit down at the bargaining table is not
sufficient at this time, when the Soviet Union is interfering in
Lithuania's relationships with Western countries,'' Kazimiera
Prunskiene said a day after meeting with Bush.
   However, Mrs. Prunskiene said it was too early to ask the United
States to impose economic sanctions against Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in an effort to prod him toward accepting
Lithuanian independence.
   She also said she did not favor granting trade favors to the
Soviets. Doing that, she said, ``would be providing implicit
support for their actions.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene called for the United States to grant formal
diplomatic recognition to Lithuania. Such a move, she said, ``would
be a logical consequence'' of the longstanding American position
that it does not recognize the Soviet annexation of her country.
   She said the refusal of Western nations to recognize an
independent Lithuania now is ``the main factor'' in the Soviets'
refusal to accept Lithuania's secession as an accomplished fact.
   Mrs. Prunskiene made her comments and replied to questions at an
appearance at the National Press Club.
   She backed away from calling on the American government to
punish the Soviets economically, saying, ``We would hope the
imposition of economic sanctions would be held in reserve as a
threat to encourage sitting down at the negotiation table, but we
are not looking for a situation where the Soviet people are forced
to suffer.''
   On Thursday, in a meeting with Bush in the Oval Office, Mrs.
Prunskiene failed to budge the president from his hands-off stance.
Bush has limited himself in the dispute between the Soviets and the
tiny breakaway republic to expressions of hope that the issue can
be ironed out in peaceful negotiations. He has expressed confidence
that ultimately Lithuania would be free.
   Mrs. Prunskiene visited the National Archives today to look at
America's Declaration of Independence, and she said that seeing it
made her think it would be a mistake for her people to back down
now from their own declaration.
   The prime minister found many sympathetic listeners as she made
the rounds Thursday in Washington. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., took
her by the hand and led her across the Senate floor.
   And members of the Young Americans for Freedom, accustomed to
demonstrating against communism, shouted outside the Heritage
Foundation headquarters in support of a woman who until three
months ago was a rising star in the Communist Party, a member of
the Supreme Soviet.
   ``Freedom yes, Gorby no,'' they chanted. ``Lithuania, don't give
in.''
   As she must have anticipated, Bush refused to recognize the new
democratic government in Lithuania as an independent country.
   And the president refused anew to apply economic pressure on
Gorbachev to call off his embargo, designed to make Lithuania
abandon its secessionist notions.
   Instead, after the two met for 45 minutes Thursday in the Oval
Office, Bush called again for ``good-faith dialogue,'' stressed his
abhorrence of ``intimidation,'' and reminded his guest that the
United States has never recognized ``the forcible incorporation of
the Baltic states into the U.S.S.R.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene, 47, introduced as ``a courageous woman from a
courageous country,'' told the conservative Heritage Foundation she
got the impression that the president at least was not
``indifferent'' to Lithuania's plight.
   ``I made it clear to President Bush that the Lithuanian nation
is awaiting basic support from him,'' she said.
   Everywhere she sought to drive home one point: ``You do not have
to choose between Lithuania and Gorbachev.''
   She argued that Gorbachev would be strengthened by the existence
of an independent Lithuania. It would help him ``overcome the
reactionary forces which oppose not only independence for the
Baltic states'' but his reforms as well, she said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she told Bush the same thing _ ``It was not
an either-or choice, either Lithuania or Gorbachev.''
   In any event, she said, ``Even the world's darling does not have
the monopolistic right to decide the fate of other nations.''
   Through all her rounds, she heard disagreement in public only
once. It fell to a liberal Democrat, Rep. Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts, to espouse support for the position ``the Bush
administration has wisely pursued.''
   He said it would be wrong to punish Gorbachev for the sins of
Stalin.
   ``America has a commitment to the principle of national
self-determination,'' Markey told Mrs. Prunskiene at a meeting of
the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a human
rights monitor. ``On the other hand, Americans also want Gorbachev
to succeed in his program of reforms,'' Markey said.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Economy Should Give Democrats Foot Up in '92</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Nixon, a veteran political
prognosticator, says that only serious trouble in the economy would
give Democrats a chance to recapture the White House in 1992.
   And, said Nixon in a television interview aired Friday night,
the Democrat who best could challenge George Bush if the economy
turns sour is New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The interview, one of a series the former president has done
this week to promote his new book, was broadcast on public
television stations.
   Nixon said Bush is popular because of a ``mistake-free
administration.'' The Democratic opposition, he said, is the
weakest in 50 years.
   ``Cuomo would be able to seize on the haves vs. the have-not
issue more effectively than any of the other Democrats because of
his appeal,'' Nixon said. ``Cuomo has high intelligence. He has
heart, or at least he appears to have, and that's what matters.''
   Nixon called Cuomo a demagogue on foreign policy, a term he also
applied to Richard Gephardt, the House Majority Leader.
   ``He's hurt himself by demagoguing on the Japanese issue,''
Nixon said about Gephardt, who has been the most outspoken foe of
Japanese trade practices.
   ``He sounds as if he doesn't really mean it because he goes so
far in doing so. I think he's losing some of his basically
Democratic constituency as a result.''
   Nixon said he seldom offers advice to Bush because ``there's
nothing that you appreciate less than having well-intentioned
(people), even former presidents, calling and saying, `Why don't
you do this, why don't you do that?'
   ``The president's problems are basically not primarily with his
enemies, they're with his friends, who think they know how to run
the thing better than he does.''
   As he did in his book, Nixon talked about Watergate, but said:
   ``I really think that 18 years of Watergate is enough. I really
haven't got anything to add to it.''
   Nixon said he hadn't changed his mind, either, about the news
media.
   ``I am a conservative,'' he said, ``I was probably one of their
favorite pin-up boys. They'd have a photograph of me over the press
club bar and they'd throw darts into it.''
   He has no doubts, he said, that members of the news media lean
to the left in their reporting.
   ``I treasure my good relations with many members of the press.
They are not slobs, as some people think. They are not inaccurate,
as many people think ... but the press is generally biased.''

<HEAD>Britain, France Announce New Cooperation in Defense, Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WADDESDON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and France, which have
jealously guarded the independence of their nuclear forces,
announced Friday they will forge closer links in security and
defense matters.
   The French and British defense ministers later announced they
were looking at the possibilities of cooperation on unspecified
nuclear programs.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Francois
Mitterrand of France spoke at a news conference during the annual
Anglo-French summit. It was held a day after President Bush
announced that short-range Lance missiles in Germany, which will
become obsolete in 1995, will not be replaced.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who had favored a new Lance missile, said Bush's
decision increased the importance of modernizing the present
``free-falling nuclear bombs ... to a missile from air-to-ground.''
   Mitterrand endorsed Bush's decision on the Lance, ``which is the
position I had in fact called for myself in 1988.'' He said France
wants to link modernization or reductions in nuclear weapons to
concrete results from Vienna talks on reducing conventional forces.
   ``Both of us as independent nuclear deterrent powers _ the only
two in Europe ... we feel we should cooperate more closely on
security and defense matters,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``We have asked our foreign and defense ministers to supervise a
program of enhanced cooperation on these issues with particular
emphasis on future security arrangements in Europe,'' she said.
   ``No field is precluded from such cooperation,'' said
Mitterrand. ``Let's move forward. We will not overnight achieve
coordination as complete and as full as I would wish, but we will
move forward.''
   Britain and France have not included their nuclear arsenals in
the superpower arms reduction talks. Both countries maintain they
need nuclear weapons as an essential minimal deterrent, and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in recent years has not pressed the
issue.
   Mrs. Thatcher said her talks with Mitterrand focused on the
situation in the Soviet Union and East-West relations.
   Mitterrand told reporters he shares Bush's fears for the
stability of the Soviet government, saying he detects ``certain
elements of fragility, things that could become dangerous.''
   Bush told reporters Thursday that he sometimes worries about
Gorbachev's staying power and the possibility of a ``takeover that
will set back the whole process'' of reform in the Soviet Union.
   But Mitterrand said: ``We aren't gambling on his failure. ...
the hypothesis that we're definitely working on is the continuation
of the renovation process that we very much hope for, and that we
hope will succeed.''
   Mrs. Thatcher avoided direct comment on Bush's fears.
   ``President Gorbachev has done wonders. He has brought about a
complete transformation in East-West relations and I think has been
the first person to have the courage to see that the Communist
system would not work for the Soviet Union,'' she said.
   ``I personally both hope and expect that he will continue as
President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union,'' she said.
   Both leaders expressed hope that the crisis over Lithuania, the
Soviet republic that declared its independence from Moscow, will be
resolved at the negotiating table.
   ``We still think that the situation can best be resolved by
continued discussions and we hope those discussions are coming near
to being brought about,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. She added that she
planned to meet Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene when
she comes to London.
   The leaders met at Waddesdon Manor, a stately home 30 miles
northwest of London.
   Defense secretaries Tom King of Britain and Jean-Pierre
Chevenement of France also met Friday and agreed to expand their
program of joint military exercises beyond 1992 and look at the
possibilities of cooperation on a future frigate.
   A French helicopter regiment will join in British army field
exercises in Germany in September 1992 and other exercises. An
exchange of helicopter pilots is also being established, they
announced.

<HEAD>Report: Spotted Owl Plan Would Mean More Violence, Divorce,

<TEXT>
   A government report says efforts to save the
rare northern spotted owl from extinction could lead to social
upheaval in the Pacific Northwest, including increased rates of
violence, divorce and suicide.
   The study anticipates the environmental effort would cause
workers to relocate, real estate values to fall and rural areas to
unite to ward off environmentalists.
   Timber harvests on federal lands in the Northwest would be cut
nearly in half by 1995, costing the region at least 13,000 jobs if
a proposed owl recovery plan is adopted, the U.S. Forest Service
and Bureau of Land Management said in a study released Thursday.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is to decide by June 23
whether to list the northern spotted owl as an endangered species.
   The report focused on the economic impact of a proposal by a
panel of government scientists led by Forest Service biologist Jack
Ward Thomas to protect the owl's forest habitat.
   However, the study also addresses the ``social and other
impacts'' of significant harvest reductions in the Northwest's
timber-based communities.
   The report said communities will pull together at first ``as
common adversity is confronted in response to the collective
perception that jobs and livelihood are being sacrificed to protect
old-growth timber.''
   But it said tensions will rise as jobs become more scarce.
   This ``will stem from a rift in these communities between those
who already have found work and those who have not.''
   ``In severe cases of community dysfunction, increased rates of
domestic disuptes, divorce, acts of violence, delinquency,
vandalism, suicide, alcoholism and other social problems are to be
expected,'' the report said.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson has indicated that if the
spotted owl is listed as endangered, the service may adopt the
Thomas proposal as its recovery plan for the species.
   The looming economic upheaval has Northwest lawmakers scrambling
to find alternatives to the committee's recommendations.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said the Forest Service report
``makes clear the outrageous and unnecessary hardship to families
that will occur if the Thomas report is adopted.''
   ``The only way to save our rural communities dependent on the
harvest of public timber is to interject human values into a
process that has thus far ignored them,'' he said.
   ``Listing the spotted owl as an endangered species is going to
be catastrophic to all Oregonians, not just those living in rural
communities,'' said Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore.

<HEAD>Labor Party Wins Local Elections, But Tories Do Better Than
Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Labor Party rejoiced Friday in sweeping
local election victories, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took
comfort that the results were not as devastating to her
Conservatives as expected.
   And some analysts predicted Mrs. Thatcher was now more secure
against possible challenges to her leadership of the Conservative
Party.
   Millions of voters protesting soaring home loan rates and an
unpopular new local tax deserted the Conservatives in the
nationwide local vote Thursday.
   But while pre-election polls showed Mrs. Thatcher with a
20-point deficit, the actual swing against the government was only
11 percent. Share prices rose on the London stock exchange,
reflecting relief by big business.
   In the most important trend for Labor, the party posted
significant gains in the prosperous and heavily populated south for
the first time since Mrs. Thatcher ousted a Labor government in
1979.
   ``That is the spread of support that we need which makes me
forecast that we are certain to win the next election,'' said Labor
Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   But in London, the Conservatives performed well. In a
particularly sore loss for Kinnock, the Tories wrested from Labor
the west London borough of Ealing, where Kinnock lives.
   ``I am sure Neil's residence in Ealing is extremely welcome to
his immediate neighbors,'' snapped Bryan Gould, a Labor campaign
manager, ```but I don't think it is a big factor in terms of
people's voting preferences.''
   And the Tories held with increased majorities two other key
boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.
   These councils have set the lowest local tax rates in Britain
under the new municipal tax system. Labor has accused them of
rigging the tax amounts to bribe voters.
   The Conservatives remained virtually shut out in Scotland and
performed badly in northern England, losing the industrial city of
Bradford.
   ``We've lost some we hoped to hold ... but we have a very good
basis on which to go forward and win the next general election,''
declared Mrs. Thatcher. She said the party had ``confounded the
polls.''
   With results declared from all but one of the 201 councils
contested, Labor gained 300 seats. The Conservatives lost 191
seats, and the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party lost 48.
   Apart from the Scottish Nationalists and the tiny Green party,
other minority parties all had net losses in the some 5,000 seats
contested.
   Labor had control of 110 of the councils contested, up from 97.
The Conservatives had 51, down from 60. The centrists had 17, down
two. No party won a majority in the rest.
   A computer analysis by the British Broadcasting Corp. showed
Labor with 42 percent of the vote, enough for a comfortable general
election victory, and the Conservatives with 31 percent.
   The centrists, performing far better than their single-figure
showing in polls, got 18 percent. The rest was scattered among
minority parties.
   BBC political correspondent John Cole said the
better-than-expected result for Mrs. Thatcher's party ``will
fortify her leadership against the assault that is going on.''
   ``All have some cause to be grateful for the results. All have
some cause to be anxious,'' said Cole.
   Speculation had increased, as Mrs. Thatcher's ratings slid over
the past 12 months, that the party would attempt to ditch her this
autumn.
   But most analysts now believe the next election, up to two years
away, remains wide open and will depend heavily on how the economy
performs.
   At present the outlook is bleak. Interest rates are at 15
percent and have failed to curb inflation, which is expected to hit
double-digit figures next month.
   Government officials hinted that the new tax, known as the poll
tax, will still be amended although not changed in principle.
   The tax has caused a national furor. It is widely perceived as
unfair because local councils divide the charges for local services
equally among all adults, regardless of income.
   It replaced the previous property tax system, under which only
17 million homeowners paid for local services such as education,
police, and garbage collection. All 38 million adults are liable
for the new tax, with rebates for the 9.5 million poorest.
   Mrs. Thatcher introduced the new system thinking that it would
prove to voters that local councils dominated by Labor were bigger
spenders. However, the average local tax has worked out to $580,
one-third above government targets. Instead of Labor councils
getting blamed for the bills, Mrs. Thatcher is taking the blame.

<HEAD>Syria-Egypt Warming Won't End Other Enduring Rifts in Arab World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Presidents Hafez Assad and Hosni Mubarak
met this week to cement a spectacular reconciliation between Syria
and Egypt after a 12-year rift.
   The meeting was friendly, but the two countries differ
fundamentally on how to bring about an Arab-Israeli peace. And
Mubarak made only halting progress in his efforts to end the feud
between Syria and Iraq.
   The welcome given to the Egyptian president in Syria would have
been unthinkable over the last decade, when Syria was vilifying
Egypt as a traitor to the Arab cause for signing the Camp David
treaty with Israel.
   The two countries resumed relations in December. Of the 17 Arab
nations that cut ties with Cairo in the wake of Camp David, only
Libya holds out.
   Egypt is trying to get Middle East peace negotiations going.
Sometimes in concert with the United States, Egypt has been
advocating a separate path to peace involving direct
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that could lead eventually to an
international parley.
   Mubarak told reporters that ``the crux of the problem is the
Palestinian problem. If there is an active role for the
Palestinians, President Hafez Assad will never miss the train.''
   But there would have to be some agreement between Assad and PLO
leader Yasser Arafat, who are bitter enemies.
   Assad regards Arafat's recognition of Israel's right to exist as
an unnecessary concession, born of weakness. He wants to build up
his armed forces to achieve ``strategic parity'' with Israel and
negotiate from a position of strength.
   Syria is the only Arab state that has not recognized the
independent Palestinian state announced at the Palestine National
Congress session in November 1988, and it blocked Damascus-based
Palestinians from attending.
   Arafat has been in the vanguard of Arab leaders who have been
pushing for an Arab summit in Baghdad to discuss the surge in
Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel. But Assad is also a foe of
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and there is little chance Assad
would travel to Damascus unless Syrian-Iraqi relations improve.
   Assad told Egyptian reporters that great differences remain
between Damascus and Baghdad but that ``time and effort'' might
heal them. Mubarak expressed hope that he might ``persuade'' Assad
to attend a summit in Baghdad.
   Assad, however, expressed surprise that Baghdad was being
discussed as a summit venue without prior consultation, and Syrian
official sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Assad
remained skeptical about the proposed arrangements for a summit.
   Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel Aziz of Saudi Arabia was due in
Damascus on Saturday on a trip aimed at trying to reconcile Syria
and Iraq. Abdullah in the past played a similar role in mending
ties between Jordan and Syria.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq announced that his country
would officially invite Assad to attend the summit, but the date
and the precise agenda remain vague.
   In addition to the feuds between the Iraqi and Syrian wings of
the Arab Baath Socialist parties in the two countries, Syria was
the only Arab country to side with Persian Iran in its 1980-88 war
with Iraq.

   Freed hostage Frank Reed
returned home to the United States today after 42 months in
captivity and rejoiced, ``I am unchained and unblindfolded.''
   Reed's plane was greeted by another recently freed hostage,
Robert Polhill. The two men embraced on the tarmac, and Reed
whispered, ``We're going to get the rest of them out, aren't we.''
   The release of Reed and Polhill left six Americans and nine
other westerners still held in captivity in Lebanon.
   ``Of course it feels wonderful,'' Reed said in a brief statement
that left many of his welcomers in tears.
   He thanked all those who worked and prayed for his release _
including the Americans still held hostage for refusing ``to let me
give up.''
   ``Thank you for all your love and concern and yes for your
tears, for I cry with you that this tragic affair will end soon.
Amen, amen, amen,'' he said.
   Reed was released by his captors on Monday and has been
undergoing medical tests in Wiesbaden, West Germany. He is expected
to face further medical tests in the next several days.
   The release of Reed and Polhill left six Americans and 10 other
westerners held hostage in Lebanon. Associated Press correspondent
Terry Anderson, kidnapped in March 1985, is the longest held.
   President Bush, who met with Polhill earlier in the week, said
Thursday that he would be willing to make a goodwill gesture toward
Iran as long as it did not appear to be negotiations for the
release of the remaining hostages.
   Before departing West Germany, the 57-year-old Reed said Britain
should do more to free two of its citizens still held captive in
Lebanon.
   ``They are my best mates, those guys, we're going to get them
out,'' Reed said of Brian Keenan and John McCarthy shortly before
he left the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden to begin his
journey back to the United States.
   Asked if he thought the British government should be doing more
to win the release of McCarthy and Keenan, Reed replied: ``You bet
they should be.'' He did not elaborate.
   Ending a two-day official visit to Finland, Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said today that Israel must free
``several hundred Lebanese hostages'' before any steps are taken to
free any of the 16 remaining Western hostages seized in Lebanon,
who are believed held by pro-Iranian groups.
   ``The other side has to take practical steps ... to influence
Israel and the Phalangists,'' he said, referring to a Christian
Lebanese group once allied with Israel.
   ``Especially the United States and Britain can persuade Israel
to release these abducted people,'' Velayati said at a news
conference.
   However, he said ``no deals had been done'' for the release of
the two Americans. He said Iran had not even been involved in any
talks with the United States.
   During his 42 months of captivity, Reed's Islamic captors
falsely told him that his 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, had
died, his daughter Marilyn Langston said Thursday in a telephone
interview from her home in Malden, Mass.
   ``He was told she had passed away,'' Langston said. ``He didn't
know she was alive until he was released. We were able to tell him
she was very much alive.''
   In a telephone call Wednesday, Reed also told Langston he had
tried to escape his captors but was quickly caught and badly beaten
for the attempt.
   ``He told me he'd been beaten. He did try to escape and they'd
beaten him very badly,'' Langston said.
   In the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, the International
Committee of the Red Cross today displayed 75,000 letters of
support for two kidnapped Swiss relief workers, Elio Erriquez, 24,
and Emanuel Christen, 34. The pair was abducted Oct. 6.
   Reed, 57, said Wednesday he had spent much of his 42 months of
captivity in the company of McCarthy and Keenan.
   Reed said he was held with two Americans as well _ Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press and the
longest-held hostage, and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Anderson was kidnapped on March 16, 1985; Sutherland was seized
on June 9, 1985. Keenan was abducted on April 11, 1986, and
McCarthy was kidnapped six days later.
   Reed has said repeatedly since his release on Monday that he is
angry that people he was held with are not yet out, and that he
will work to help win their freedom.
   He told reporters that in Washington he would be meeting with
relatives of Keenan and McCarthy.
   Reed spoke briefly to reporters shortly after emerging from the
Wiesbaden hospital, where he had been undergoing medical tests and
debriefings by a special U.S. State Department team seeking clues
about Western hostages in Lebanon.
   With Reed were his Syrian wife, Fahima, and their son, Tarek.
   Reed lost 60 pounds in captivity during which he was kept
blindfolded and bound, but is otherwise in basically sound health,
doctors have said.

<HEAD>U.S. Spurns Reported Gadhafi Offer on Disputed Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has rejected a reported
offer by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to dismantle a plant the
Bush administration contends was designed to produce poison gas,
the State Department said Friday.
   Gadhafi has said the plant produces pharmaceuticals and,
according to diplomats, he offered to dismantle the facility if
Western countries agreed to replace it.
   ``I'd like a free pharmaceutical plant, too. This is not a
pharmaceutical plant; this is a chemical weapons facility,'' State
Department deputy spokesman Richard n asked about
the reported offer.
   ``Gadhafi built it, GadhBoucher said wheafi should dismantle it. We're
not
attracted by the offer.''
   The Rabta plant was said to have been damaged by fire in late
March, shortly after Gadhafi reportedly made the offer.
   The United States initially said the blaze caused heavy damage
to the plant, but later news reports said U.S. officials had
decided the fire was a hoax.
   A review of satellite photographs reportedly showed that burn
marks were painted on the building, apparently in an effort to head
off any U.S. military action against the facility.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year odyssey is coming to an end for the
oldest known drifting iceberg, which is beginning to break up in
the South Atlantic, the government said Friday.
   The iceberg, once twice the area of Washington, D.C., was first
sighted in 1978.
   Since then it has drifted some 5,700 miles, almost entirely
around Antarctica, according to the Joint Ice Center operated by
the Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The iceberg was last sighted southwest of the Falkland Islands
in February, according to Navy Capt. Tom Callaham. He said
satellite studies show that the berg is now breaking up in a region
known as the ``screaming fifties.''
   That portion of ocean, near 50 degrees South latitude, is famed
for its rough weather and powerful winds.

<HEAD>Train Wreck in Mexico Kills At Least 6, Red Cross Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new death toll indicates six
dead, sted of 40, reason for discrepancy, details. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OAXACA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passenger train derailed and plunged
into a dry riverbed in the southern state of Oaxaca, killing at
least six people, the Mexican Red Cross said today.
   The organization originally gave a death toll from Thursday
night's crash of at least 40. Ana Maria Tovar, director of the Red
Cross in Oaxaca, today blamed the discrepancy on the magnitude of
the wreck, the isolation of the area and that the crash occurred at
night.
   A news release from the Mexican National Railroad put the toll
of the second-class train, The Oaxacan, en route from Oaxaca to
Mexico City at seven dead and 20 injured.
   The train was near capacity, carrying about 200 passengers,
according to Oaxacan station chief Jose Velasco Altamirano.
   Red Cross workers said there were six bodies in the morgue at
Cuicatlan, the village near where the wreck occurred, and none in
Oaxaca, about 220 miles south of Mexico City.
   Red Cross workers continued today to search the wreckage for
further victims. There were no reports of foreigners among the
victims.
   The wreck happened in the mountains near the state capital of
Oaxaca.
   Municipal officials in Cuicatlan said 10 injured were taken
there. Red Cross workers in Oaxaca said hospitals there had about
25, some in serious condition.
   The Red Cross said the train plunged into a dry riverbed.
   Velasco Altamirano said the entire train _ two engines, two
passenger cars and one freight car _ left the tracks.
   Velasco Altamirano said the victims were evacuated by railroad
handcar and one freight train because of the remoteness of the area.
   He blamed the wreck on an apparent brake failure.

<HEAD>Departing Bailout Boss Says Heavy Costs Coming From S&amp;L Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Departing savings and loan cleanup boss L.
William Seidman said Friday that ``real pain'' is yet to come in
the bailout and urged patience with his successor.
   ``All the evidence to date is that the costs will exceed those
originally estimated,'' he told a House Banking Committee task
force on the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``We are operating now in markets where interest rates are going
up and property values are going down,'' he said.
   Panel members lavished praise on the 69-year-old regulator, who
is often at odds with the administration and is being nudged out as
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution
Trust Corp. The FDIC insures bank and thrift institution deposits;
the RTC conducts the S&amp;L bailout.
   At Seidman's suggestion, President Bush is turning to William
Taylor, the Federal Reserve Board's director of bank supervision,
to take over the position.
   Panel members welcomed the prospect of Taylor's appointment
cautiously, but questioned whether he would match Seidman as an
independent voice. Seidman asked them not to judge Taylor's
performance too quickly.
   ``Don't be impatient. This is a long, hard job. It isn't going
to be accomplished anytime soon,'' he said.
   ``The real pain of what's taking place, on everything from
increased government borrowing to the effect on real estate
markets, is still being felt. I think it is very important that no
one expect by this time next year we'll all feel great,'' said
Seidman.
   However, Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the task force,
said, ``I worry about the independence of the FDIC and the RTC. I
worry about future policy decisions driven by political spin
control.''
   And Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., berated the administration for
its willingness to let Seidman go. He said Taylor, despite his
ability, would fail without stronger administration support.
   ``I think the administration ... should be on its hands and
knees begging you to stay. The messenger shouldn't be blamed for
the bad news,'' Schumer told Seidman.
   ``Mr. Taylor's talents will be wasted and the country will
suffer unless this administration ... (makes) this crisis a top
priority. The president can't do it if he treats Bill Taylor with
the same resounding indifference as he did Bill Seidman,'' said
Schumer.
   Vento's panel focused on the slow pace of the sale of real
estate, loans, securities and other assets of failed thrifts.
   Seidman acknowledged that real estate sales of $2.1 billion,
leaving a $16.4 billion portfolio, have been ``not as much as we
would have liked.'' However, he said the agency is preparing policy
changes that would allow it to sell property at auction and at a
discount from appraised values.
   He warned, though, that the requirement that the agency appraise
nearly all of its assets could greatly slow the bailout. Some
appraisals, in areas where appraisers are flooded with business,
are taking up to a year.
   ``I think we have to be very careful and apply common sense ...
or appraisals alone will stop this whole process,'' Seidman said.
   Seidman was backed by former FDIC Chairman Irvine H. Sprague,
who said appraisals were little better than ``guesstimates'' and
that ``by far the cheapest approach is to get what you can
quickly.''
   ``The alternative is an ever increasing carrying cost, ever
multiplying fees to attorneys, appraisers and accountants, and an
ever growing bureaucracy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Militant Workers Clash With Police in Labor Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Militant workers and students hurling
rocks and firebombs fought street battles with riot police in three
cities Friday, but labor unrest around the country showed signs of
easing, reports said.
   Police reported some arrests and injuries in protests in Seoul,
Ulsan and Kwangju but gave no overall figures.
   In the southern industrial city of Changwon, police raided a
hospital morgue and seized the body of a labor activist guarded by
militant workers.
   In Ulsan, 200 miles southeast of Seoul, an estimated 2,000
workers clashed with riot police at several places. Police fired
tear gas to disperse the workers who charged in groups of 50 to 500.
   Labor unrest in Ulsan appeared to ease considerably after 27,000
workers of the Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest auto maker,
voted Friday to reopen their assembly lines Monday.
   Widening labor protests turned violent a week ago when about
12,000 police stormed the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard,
the world's largest, to quell a three-day strike demanding the
release of jailed union leaders.
   Workers of several dozen plants in Ulsan and other industrial
regions staged sympathy strikes.
   Hyundai officials in Seoul said about half of the 100,000
workers at their 13 subsidiaries in Ulsan were back to work Friday.
They said they expected further improvement in the situation after
the anti-strike vote at their car plant.
   The officials said the shipyard also would be open Monday if
workers perched atop a 240-foot crane come down. The company said
5,000 management personnel were working at the shipyard Friday to
prepare to resume operations.
   The workers climbed the crane during the police raid on the
shipyard last week and threatened ``extreme action'' unless their
demand for the release of jailed workers was met.
   Police spread nets and air mattresses around the base of the
crane.
   Outside Seoul's Sogang University, about 1,000 radical students,
hurling rocks and firebombs, fought fierce street battles with riot
police, denouncing alleged government suppression of labor movement.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' yelled the students from
about a dozen schools in the capital.
   Before clashing with police, the students burned a U.S. flag,
lashing out at what they called Washington's imperialistic support
of the Roh government.
   In the southern provincial capital of Kwangju, about 700
students, throwing firebombs and rocks, clashed with riot police
after a campus rally protesting the police raid on the Hyundai
shipyard, the national news agency Yonhap said.
   In Changwon, a port city 212 miles south of Seoul, about 600
riot police charged into the hospital before dawn, took the body of
the dead worker and returned it to his family for burial, Yonhap
said.
   The agency said about 200 militant workers guarding the morgue
were overpowered by police wielding clubs and shields. Police
arrested 149 workers, it said.
   Officials feared the death of Kim Young-il, 28, might be used to
stir up more trouble. Police in Changwon said their raid was at the
request of the dead worker's family, who opposed a large
``political'' funeral planned by militant workers.
   Radicals in the past have kept the bodies of workers or
dissidents against the wishes of their families or held large
public funerals as anti-government protests.
   Kim, a labor activist at the Tongil Industry Co. in Changwon,
jumped to his death from a two-story building at his plant Thursday
after dousing himself with paint thinner and setting it ablaze.
   The worker left suicide notes complaining of a hard life and
alleging police surveillance of his labor activity.

   Water receded Friday from many north Texas areas
that were hit by the worst rainfall in almost 70 years, but at
least one neighborhood was evacuated as runoff kept floodwaters
high.
   In Oklahoma, rains that closed dozens of highways, forced the
evacuation of hundreds of people and caused at least one death
abated. And flooding along the Arkansas River forced communities in
Arkansas from Fort Smith to Pine Bluff to take precautions in
attempts to limit damages.
   Texas' death toll from this week's storms rose to five with the
discovery Friday of the body of a 77-year-old woman whose truck was
swept into a Collin County creek. Ten Texans have died in flooding
during the last two weeks.
   Police also included a man who died Thursday when he fell into a
rain-swollen creek while trying to check on water lines.
   Besides the four flood deaths this week, officials in San
Antonio said the rain contributed to the death of a man who
apparently lost control of his vehicle Thursday on a slick, wet
road.
   Officials evacuated the Sandy Lake Lodge mobile home park in
Carrollton that was awash in overflow from the Trinity River.
   But throughout the river basin, the Trinity was receding at a
rate of about an inch an hour, said Carlo Bravo, an engineer with
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   ``Relatively speaking, that's very fast,'' he said.
   The Trinity invaded homes from Fort Worth to Dallas and drove
hundreds of people to shelters. It crested Thursday night at Dallas
at 47 feet _ 17 feet above flood level and its highest mark since
1949.
   Flooded roads snarled rush-hour traffic for a second day in
Dallas and Fort Worth.
   North Texas has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the first four
months of 1990, the most since 1922. As much as 7 inches of rain
fell within 24 hours in some areas.
   At Lake Texoma in Oklahoma, water gushed over the spillway at a
depth of 2 feet, and at least 100 residents were evacuated.
   Most of the danger appeared to be in Bryan and Marshall counties.
   ``We're knee-deep in evacuating people on the upstream side of
the dam,'' said Johnny Shepherd, civil defense director in Bryan
County. ``It's flooding now. Some have had water just at the base
of their home for days, and now they're packing their suitcases.''
   Mike McCoy, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman in Denison,
Texas, said the lake is expected to crest Monday at 644 to 645
feet, which would break the record of 643.18 set in 1957.
   McCoy said it would take about 60 days for levels on the massive
lake along the Oklahoma-Texas line to return to normal without any
more rain. He said the area already had exceeded the average annual
rainfall of 32 inches.
   Nearly 50 highways have been closed or will be closed, most of
them in southeastern Oklahoma, state Transportation Secretary Neal
McCaleb said
   Officials believe that to be a record number of highway closings.
   The forecast called for the rain to end this weekend, but some
lakes and rivers were expected to continue rising until Sunday.
   In Arkansas' Faulkner County in the state's central section,
this weekend's Toad Suck Daze festival was moved from the Toad Suck
Park along the river to downtown Conway. The Army Corps of
Engineers closed the park and employees began evacuating the park
Thursday.
   Trey Schroeder, a spokesman for Gov. Bill Clinton, said the
governor authorized the use of 75 Army National Guardsmen for
sandbagging along the Arkansas River at Fort Smith.
   A duty officer, Philip Doyle, said sandbags were used in the
Treasure Hills subdivision north of Conway where some homes were
threatened by Cadron Creek. Sandbagging also was under way at
Dardanelle and in Perry County, he said.
   Asked if conditions were expected to worsen, he said: ``If it
does, we're up that well-known creek.''

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
relied on political ties to decide discretionary housing grants and
once ordered money to help a ``down and out'' former campaign
manager, an imprisoned former aide said Friday.
   DuBois L. Gilliam concluded three days of testimony about abuse
in the Reagan administration's Department of Housing and Urban
Development by describing Pierce as deeply involved in funding
decisions under one program where politics was virtually the only
qualification examined.
   ``Secretary Pierce _ when he wanted something done, he would
tell you to get it funded,'' Gilliam said.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House panel
investigating the HUD scandals, called Gilliam's testimony
``credible.''
   He said Gilliam had contradicted assertions Pierce made under
oath before the committee on May 25, 1989, that he had not been
involved in deciding who received HUD grants.
   The former deputy assistant secretary is serving a prison
sentence for abuse of HUD programs and testified under a grant of
court grant of immunity.
   ``We established the fact that contrary to his testimony, Mr.
Pierce personally directed the funding of a very large number of
projects,'' Lantos said. ``... Mr. Pierce did favors for friends
and political allies on countless occasions.''
   But Pierce's attorney Paul L. Perito angrily accused Lantos and
other committee members of ``defaming my client'' while protected
by congressional immunity. He said Gilliam's testmony was not
credible and ``doesn't amount to a loaded water pistol.''
   Perito said Pierce's denial of involvement applied only to the
Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, the first to be publicly
implicated in allegations of abuse. The grants Gilliam testified
about Friday were under the secretary's discretionary fund.
   ``My client was never asked, `Did you personally make decisions
in your own discretionary fund,''' Perito said. ``Had he been asked
he would have said, `Sure I did. It was my discretionary fund.'''
   Congressional investigators contended Pierce's year-old
statement was a broader assertion. Some members of the panel have
urged that special prosecutor Arlin Adams be permitted to broaden
the scope of his investigation of Pierce to include perjury before
Congress. It now is confined to Section 8 program activities.
   Pierce's May 1989 appearance before the committee was at the
start of the panel's HUD investigation, and he appeared without a
lawyer. Pierce refused later subpoenas to testify, invoking his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   In his final testimony, Gilliam asserted Pierce ordered projects
receive federal grants under HUD's community development technical
assistance program.
   He said he did not believe Pierce or other top aides received
gratuities or kickbacks. Gilliam has admitted taking some $100,000
in gratuities while at HUD.
   Gilliam said Pierce ordered him to provide a $350,000 grant to a
private group in which his friend and former political manager, Sam
Singletary, was a partner. He said Pierce wanted to help Singletary
because ``he was down and out. ... And I did so. ... He told me to
fund the project.''
   The grant was arranged even though Singletary and his partner
lacked experience and the city that was to benefit from the
project, Camden, N.J., did not request it.
   Although the secretary had discretion to direct grants under the
technical assistance programs, committee staff director Stuart
Weisberg said basing decisions on politics could be considered an
abuse of the program and against the intent of Congress.
   Weisberg said Singletary was a close friend of Pierce's who had
run his unsuccessful election campaigns for a New York state
judgeship in 1959 and 1960. Lantos said Singletary was indicted in
1985 on state charges involving a job training program receiving
state money.
   Perito, in response, denied Pierce was close to Singletary and
said Pierce ``had virtually no knowledge of any of this ... He
simply approved a routine funding recommendation in the usual and
customary way.''
   Gilliam described meetings held with himself, Pierce and
executive assistant Deborah Gore Dean in which they would would
discuss the political sponsors of each applicant _ and often not
mention the merits of a project.
   ``I would give him the name of the company and the political
sponsors,'' Gilliam said. ``Boom, boom, boom _ and that's the way
we would conduct the meeting.''
   Lantos said the program was ``a cross between a slush fund and a
political action committee.''
   In another case, Gilliam said he directed a grant to another
group because of its connection with a brother of Pierce. He
offered few other details. Perito denied Pierce ever directed a
grant to his brother.

   l Island on March 21.
It and five other sea lions had been captured near Seattle's
Ballard Locks on March 12.
   The animal was last tracked at San Miguel Island on April 3,
Alabaster said.
   Some sea lions migrate north in the winter to Puget Sound, and
some have discovered that the fish ladder at the Ballard Locks
offers abundant, easy meals.
   The sea lions have devastated the run of wild steelhead that
head past the locks to spawn in streams that feed Lake Washington.
   Scientists have tried several schemes to discourage the sea
lions, including trapping, firecrackers and bopping them with blunt
arrows shot from crossbows.
   The free ride home for the six animals was an experiment to see
whether they would return to Puget Sound within the same season
after being relocated to their Channel Islands rookeries, NOAA said
in a statement.
   ``We wanted to find out if they would come back, and we did,''
Alabaster said. ``Now we have an idea how long it takes.''
   Each of the animals had a radio transmitter glued to its back.
Until now, only one animal, No. 42, had been recorded north of the
Channel Islands. It was detected April 6 near Big Sur, south of
Monterey, Calif., NOAA said.
   National Marine Fisheries Services spokesman Joe Scordino said
No. 22 probably will turn around and head back south. The steelhead
run is over and the fish ladder at the locks is closed for
maintenance.
   Scordino said scientists aren't sure why No. 22 made the swim
north, since this is the time of year when sea lions usually leave
Puget Sound to return to California.

   Next month's mission of space
shuttle Columbia will include an astronaut who was kept off a
practice countdown last week because of an unspecified medical
condition, NASA said Friday.
   Samuel Durrance, 46, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins
University, will help operate a $100 million astronomical
observatory known as Astro during the mission, which will last nine
or 10 days. Launch is targeted for May 16.
   ``Durrance's medical condition has been evaluated and resolved
to the satisfaction of the NASA aerospace medicine board, clearing
the way for his participation,'' the agency said in a statement.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration refused to
elaborate on Durrance's problem.
   It will be the first shuttle flight for Durrance, who has been
training for the mission for about 10 years. Much of that time has
been spent helping in the design, construction and testing of the
Astro observatory.
   Durrance and payload specialist Ron Parise were selected as part
of the seven-member crew because of their knowledge of the payload.
Had his medical problem kept him off next month's flight, Durrance
would have been considered only for future Astro-related missions,
said NASA spokesman Jeff Carr.

<HEAD>Top Adviser Says `Stalinist,' `Czarist' Protesters Insulted
Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Stalinists, czarists and other ultra-rightist
protesters insulted Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders
during the May Day parade, forcing them to leave the festivities, a
top adviser said Friday.
   Alexander Yakovlev, speaking at a news conference, also
dismissed reports in Europe suggesting the Soviet army was
mobilized Feb. 25 to try to overthrow Gorbachev or pressure him to
toe the military's line.
   The unofficial May Day demonstration that followed the
traditionally well-orchestrated workers' parade Tuesday brought
tens of thousands of protesters onto Red Square in an outpouring of
discontent from both left and right.
   Gorbachev, who tapped his fingers in apparent impatience, and
the other leaders left their perch atop the Lenin Mausoleum after
enduring the protest for about 20 minutes.
   ``The leadership left Red Square because of political
considerations, because we do not agree with that ultra-right
political position that was demonstrated by those people,''
Yakovlev said.
   He made no mention of the criticism from those who complained
that Gorbachev's reforms have not been radical enough. Yakovlev is
widely considered to be an architect of the reforms.
   ``I saw Stalin portraits, Nicholas II portraits,'' he said.
``Slogans were heard that Ceausescu's destiny is in store for some
people. That was really unfortunate. Anybody would treat these
slogans as an insult.''
   The Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown and
executed in December.
   ``To us, with our tragic history, it is not admissible that some
people would have a chance to turn back the course of history, back
to the abyss,'' he added.
   Yakovlev's comments came in a lengthy question-and-answer
session with Soviet and foreign journalists at a meeting sponsored
by Interfax, a Soviet news agency.
   Asked about reports published in Europe that the army was
mobilized Feb. 25 to pressure Gorbachev or even overthrow him,
Yakovlev labeled them rumors and said there are ``no grounds'' to
support them. He denied there were military movements that day.
   It was widely reported at the time, however, that thousands of
troops, many in riot gear, were brought into Moscow to ensure that
a mass demonstration that day did not get out of hand. The troop
movements, mostly of soldiers from the Interior Ministry's internal
security forces, were widely viewed as a government effort to deter
people from participating in the gathering, which authorities
repeatedly warned might be violent.
   ``There is no basis to the claim that Gorbachev had to somehow
change his policies in response to that pressure,'' Yakovlev said.
``We do not see any grounds to suspect our army, to think that they
are hatching some kind of plans against the party, against the
leadership. We do not believe that this is the case.''
   Asked repeatedly about Lithuania, he did not retreat from the
Kremlin's position that the breakaway Baltic republic must freeze,
suspend or reverse its March 11 independence declaration before the
Soviet Union will ease its economic blockade and open negotiations.
   ``Any negotiations begin from the beginning, not from the end,''
he said.
   Yakovlev met last month with Lithuanian lawmakers in what was
billed as a strictly unofficial ``conversation'' but was seen at
the time as a possible precursor to negotiations. It apparently led
nowhere.
   Asked about the redeployment of military forces in Europe as a
result of the reunification of Germany, Yakovlev said some
redistribution will be necessary, but he would not favor
surrounding Germany with a deterrent force.
   ``It would be highly undesirable, even inadmissable, to have
some grouping of forces emerging around Germany,'' he said. ``I
believe that Germany has had its share of fighting. I believe
Germany has had enough of wars, as all of us have.''
   ``The Soviet people still retain some psychological concerns''
as a result of their devastating wars with Germany, he said. ``They
are somewhat guarded in their attitude because we have experienced
too many tragedies, but we believe that new relations will emerge
in Europe, and revenge or other such feelings will be prevented
through joint efforts.''

   Lithuania's prime minister said Friday that
White House policies merely urging good-faith negotiation to
resolve the Baltic republic's independence crisis are an inadequate
response in the face of Soviet economic warfare.
   ``Simply making statements that there should be cooperation is
not adequate at this time when the Soviets are interfering in
Lithuania's ties with other countries,'' Kazimiera Prunskiene said
in a blunt comment just a day after her unofficial Oval Office
meeting with President Bush.
   Mrs. Prunskiene also urged the United States not to grant
favored trade status to the Soviet Union.
   ``Now that Moscow has imposed an economic blockade, it wouldn't
be logical to grant most favored nation (tariff) status. It would
be providing implicit support for their actions.''
   However, in a shift of position, she said it was too early to
ask the United States to impose economic sanctions against Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in an effort to prod him toward
accepting Lithuanian independence.
   ``We would hope the imposition of economic sanctions would be
held in reserve as a threat to encourage sitting down at the
negotiating table, because we are not looking for a situation where
the Soviet people are forced to suffer,'' she said.
   Vytatus Landsbergis, president of Lithuania's parliament, has
harshly criticized Bush's recent decision to defer possible
sanctions, saying it was reminiscent of Western appeasement of Nazi
Germany immediately before World War II.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said after her Thursday meeting with Bush that
she would not have used such a comparison, but that Landsbergis had
spoken in his zeal for Lithuanian independence.
   The prime minister failed to persuade Bush to change his stance
on the secessionist republic.
   Mrs. Prunskiene, in comments Friday at the National Press Club,
suggested that guarantees of Lithuanian independence should be both
political and economic.
   Lithuania wants quick diplomatic recognition from the United
States and other nations, and Mrs. Prunskiene said the refusal of
Western capitals to do so is the main factor in the Soviet refusal
to accept Lithuania's secession.
   Diplomatic recognition should be the logical consequence of the
policy of many of these nations during the last 50 years to
recognize the forced incorporation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
into the Soviet Union, she said.
   The republic also seeks ``concrete political support'' to enable
it to enter the world economic market, she said, adding that
Lithuania does not seek handouts or direct assistance.
   The May 30 Bush-Gorbachev summit in Washington may prove crucial
for Baltic independence, she said.
   ``I think they have a chance to make decisions which are of
critical importance to the future of Europe and bring to a final
close World War II.''
   But she said it was important for the United States and other
Western governments to move decisively in the few weeks remaining
before Bush and Gorbachev meet.
   ``I would hope that when Gorbachev comes to the United States
this question (of international guarantees for Lithuania) will not
have been left hanging, but that something will have been done
about it.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene began her second busy day in Washington with a
pilgrimage to the National Archives for a firsthand look at the
Declaration of Independence.
   ``It occurred to me that America was very fortunate that the
Declaration of Independence of the United States was never
suspended and that you enjoy true democracy,'' she said.
   ``For that reasons, for us to suspend our declaration of
independence would be contrary to the spirit of democracy I find
here in the United States.''
   On Saturday, Mrs. Prunskiene was scheduled to address a
Lithuanian youth congress before beginning her journey home.
   Spokesman Mark Johnson said Mrs. Prunskiene had been invited to
stop in London for talks with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, but that final arrangements had not been made.

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Star of the Sea Church was moved as a
lava flow burned through the heart of this picturesque beach town
Friday, more than seven years after Kilauea Volcano began its
latest eruption.
   The flow picked up speed and advanced more than 200 yards
overnight, but so far it has bypassed the Kalapana Store and
Drive-Inn and the Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church.
   It was moving behind both structures, and was beginning to rise
along the Congregational Church's wall that abutted a meeting hall.
But civil defense officials said they were more concerned about
three homes in danger of being cut off from road access before
residents could remove their belongings.
   The wooden Roman Catholic Church _ also called ``the painted
church'' _slowly made its way down Beach Road, which crews had
cleared of utility poles and overhanging tree branches.
   An elderly native Hawaiian woman pleaded with workers and civil
defense officials not to move the church. Church officals decided
last week to save its hand-painted wall murals.
   ``How can you move it? How can you move it?'' the woman screamed
at workers for a construction company that volunteered its services.
   Others echoed similar sentiments.
   ``How can you call it Star of the Sea Church if they put it on a
mountain?'' asked Kapena Kamahele, whose family has a long history
in Kalapana.
   Workers toiled throughout the night to prepare the church for
relocation. It was taken about a mile out of town, where it will
stay until church officials decide where to move it.
   Civil defense ordered members of the congregational church who
had spent the night in the building to evacuate Friday morning.
   ``The book is closed. We open a new book today,'' said Bernice
McKeague, church moderator.
   The congregation held a prayer vigil Thursday night and watched
as the lava built up in a gully behind the church. Long before the
present flow arrived, church members voted never to move the
church, saying it would be hypocritical of their faith.
   The church, originally built along the seashore in 1823, was
destroyed by an earthquake, tidal wave and lava in 1868.
   The earthquake sunk the land the church was located on, and a
few years later it was rebuilt at the site where Star of the Sea is
located. Erosion prompted the congregation to move again across the
street to its present location, McKeague said.
   ``She packs a real history,'' McKeague said.
   So far, Walter Yamaguchi, owner of the Kalapana Store and
Drive-Inn since 1963 has been correct in maintaining that his store
would be spared.
   He has been making daily offerings to Hawaiian volcano goddess
Pele.
   ``Madame Pele will never take me,'' the 82-year-old man said.
   He added that he left some supplies in the store to sell once he
is allowed to open again.
   Of increasing concern to authorities is the threat to public
health when the lava begins to flow into the ocean, which it
eventually will do if it continues its present path. When lava hits
the water, it creates sulphuric acid, a harmful toxic substance
known in volcano country as ``laze.''
   Officials have not disclosed plans on how they will deal with
that.
   To date, 131 homes in the community on the island of Hawaii have
burned since the eruption began on Jan. 3, 1983.

   Neil Bush, the president's son, said Friday
that he had agreed to testify before the House Banking Committee
about the failure of a Colorado thrift on whose board he served.
   The panel, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, is
looking into the December 1988 collapse of Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association of Denver.
   The connections among Silverado and other failed S&amp;Ls _
including Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association and the junk bond operation of former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. financier Michael Milken _ are being examined.
   The committee has scheduled two hearings. Thrift regulators are
expected to testify May 22, while Bush and and other Silverado
board members are scheduled to appear May 23.
   ``I have agreed to participate and will continue to cooperate
with Congress, the Office of Thrift Supervision and any other
agencies involved,'' Bush said in a statement released through his
attorney's office.
   The thrift office has alleged that loans by Silverado to Bush's
business partners, developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, were a
conflict of interest for Bush.
   Neil Bush was on the S&amp;L's board from October 1985 until August
1988.
   In January, regulators began disciplinary procedures against
Bush that could result in a lifetime ban from the financial
institutions industry. Bush has denied any wrongdoing.

   What a trip, man! The Lava Lite, a fixture in
psychedelic pads in the '60s, is 25 years old.
   During the past quarter-century, the flowing, glowing lamps were
praised by the American Institute of Architects and seen on the
U.S. president's desk in the movie ``Amazon Women on The Moon.''
   ``People feel the way about their Lava Lites that other people
feel about their pets,'' said Christopher Baldovin, marketing
director for Haggerty Enterprises, the Chicago-based company that
began making them in 1965. ``It's like watching fish, but you don't
have to feed them.''
   In the last two years, more Lava Lites were sold annually than
when they were introduced, even though the price has doubled to
about $50, Baldovin said.
   Customers include former hippies who can finally afford one and
teen-agers not yet born when they were introduced.
   Retailers nationwide said demand for the lamp has steadily grown
since sales dropped to their lowest point in 1983.
   Although the company also manufactures The Wave, a fluid-filled
rectangle that simulates wave shapes while rocking slowly on a
motorized base, the Lava Lite is by far the company's most famous
product.
   A lanternlike glass chamber lit from the bottom, the lava (a
goop of 11 non-toxic substances discovered by accident by English
inventor Craven Walker) gurgles slowly to the top, then settles
gently back at the bottom, where the cycle begins again.
   Lava Lite owners are fiercely loyal. Haggerty customer service
representative Jean Bartyzel said that the day after Northern
California's Oct. 17 earthquake, she was swamped with calls from
distraught customers whose lamps had broken during the quake.
   Even the American Institute of Architects praised Lava Lites. An
institute official quoted in The Washington Post said their
``kinetic structural elements constitute an intriguing relief from
hard-edged rectilinearity.''

   Shareholders at Safeco Corp.'s annual meeting
didn't show much reaction to disappointing first-quarter profits,
but they applauded a plea to allow male employees to wear non-white
shirts.
   ``For 28 long years, I have been needlessly white,'' Jack
Hepfer, a recently retired Safeco lawyer, said of the 67-year-old
dress code.
   Hepfer cited Hawthorne Dent, founder of the Seattle-based
insurance company, as having said in 1955 that there was ``nothing
the matter with colored shirts.'' After all, Hepfer said, ``The
Berlin Wall came down.''
   But the white-shirts-only policy didn't.
   Safeco Chairman Bruce Maines defended the rule at Wednesday's
annual meeting and company president Roger Eigsti refused to change
it.
   ``The white-shirt rule is a plain, straight, pragmatic rule.
It's a part of our thing. It's part of our personality,'' said
Maines, who owns 30 white shirts.
   The company reported first-quarter profits of 89 cents a share,
down from $1.04 a share in the first three months of 1989.

<HEAD>Private Companies Make Corn Sale To Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total about 13.9 million tons of corn, 3.3 million tons of
wheat, 342,300 tons of soybeans and 1.2 million tons of soybean
meal. In addition, sales of barley total 7,300 tons.
   The current long-term agreement expires on Dec. 31 and a
five-year pact to replace it has been tentatively approved by U.S.
and Soviet negotiators.
   Meanwhile, the latest sales raised the total for 1989-90
delivery to almost 17.2 million tons, the announcement said. In
1988-89, sales were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 600,000 tons of
corn would be about 23.6 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.65 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average. Thus, the latest
sale could have a farm value of about $63 million.

   A man who murdered two police officers 14
years ago was put to death Friday by three jolts in the electric
chair that produced flames, sparks and smoke from his masked head.
   Jessie Joseph Tafero's lawyer described the execution as
``torture'' and Florida Gov. Bob Martinez immediately requested an
investigation of the technical problems in carrying out the
sentence.
   Tafero, 43, condemned for the shooting deaths of Highway Patrol
Trooper Phillip Black and visiting Canadian constable Donald Irwin,
died at 7:13 a.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke.
   In a 1984 interview, Tafero likened himself and Sonya Jacobs,
his girlfriend and co-defendant, to a ``modern-day Bonnie and
Clyde.'' They were denied permission to marry after both were
condemned to die.
   When a black-hooded executioner turned the switch for the first
time at 7:07 a.m., flames rose 6 inches from the hood covering
Tafero's face and scalp.
   The executioner then interrupted the standard two-minute,
2,000-volt electrical cycle, and prison officials later determined
a wet sponge on Tafero's head caught fire, said state Corrections
Department spokesman Bob Macmaster.
   Prison Superintendent Tom Barton, who usually shows no emotions
in the clinical atmosphere of Florida executions, had a pained look
on his face.
   Despite the repeated jolts, Dr. Frank Kilgo, the prison's chief
medical officer, believed Tafero died quickly. Macmaster quoted
Kilgo as saying, ``I believe he was unconscious the minute the
current hit him.''
   Mark Olive, an Atlanta attorney who represented Tafero, said
Martinez should ask for an independent investigation and suspend
further executions until the technical problems have been resolved.
   ``The state cannot bring a person to justice by torturing
them,'' said Olive. ``Torture, is per se, cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   The governor instructed Department of Corrections officials to
prepare a report on the execution. But he defended the use of the
death penalty, recalling that Tafero coldly took the lives of two
officers 14 years ago.
   ``It is unfortunate that this incident affected the execution,
but it is far more unfortunate that it took 14 years to bring to
justice a man who killed two police officers,'' Martinez said.
   Tafero was the 22nd person put to death in Florida and the 124th
nationally since the U.S. Supreme Court restored states' rights to
execute prisoners in 1976. Tafero's execution was Florida's first
in exactly a year.
   In a final statement, Tafero complained that last-minute motions
filed on his behalf with a federal judge and a state Circuit Court
judge apparently were ignored.
   ``I'd like to say that the death penalty as applied by the
states is very arbitrary and capricious,'' he said.
   Outside the prison, four supporters of capital punishment peered
through heavy fog, watching from a pasture across the road for a
signal that Tafero was dead.
   About a dozen death penalty opponents conducted a silent,
candlelight vigil. A protest march, which organizers believe will
draw about 400 people, will begin outside the prison Saturday and
continue until May 19 in Atlanta.
   The 39-year-old officers killed by Tafero were shot to death
when they checked a parked car at an Interstate 95 rest stop near
Fort Lauderdale on Feb. 20, 1976.
   Tafero, Ms. Jacobs, her two children and traveling companion
Walter Rhodes Jr. were sleeping when the officers approached. Shots
were fired when Tafero struggled outside the car with the officers.
   Black died from gunshot wounds to the head and neck; Irwin, of
Kitchener, Ontario, received fatal wounds to his right eye and
shoulder.
   Tafero, Ms. Jacobs and Rhodes were convicted of first-degree
murder. Rhodes testified for the prosecution and received three
concurrent life terms. Ms. Jacobs' death sentence was commuted to
life in prison in 1981.
   Early Friday, Tafero met with his mother, Kathleen Tafero of
Miami, and a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Robert Baker,
celebrated Mass for the condemned inmate. Tafero then placed a
telephone call to Ms. Jacobs, the mother of their daughter,
Christina.

   Thousands of people lit candles in the rain
Friday to dedicate a memorial to four Kent State University
students who were slain by Ohio National Guardsmen during an
anti-war protest 20 years ago.
   About 4,000 people huddled beneath umbrellas on a parking lot
near the site of the shootings, which took place on May 4, 1970,
and marked a tragic rallying point for those who opposed American
involvement in the Vietnam War.
   Most of the people in the crowd placed lighted candles on the
hilltop granite memorial. Some placed their candles amid the 58,175
daffodils planted on the nearby hillside for each American killed
in the war.
   About 200 students nearby waged a silent protest by raising
clenched fists and holding up handmade signs bearing messages of
``Whose May 4th is it anyway?'' and ``Don't minimize student
death.'' Some held up two fingers, V-shaped, in the peace sign
popularized during the anti-war movement.
   Some Kent State students have contended the university's
$200,000 memorial is too little, too late.
   Former U.S. Sen. George McGovern, the keynote speaker, said the
memorial should encourage reconciliation between the United States
and Vietnam, which do not have diplomatic relations.
   ``The war in Vietnam is unfinished,'' the unsuccessful 1972
Democratic presidential candidate said. ``The killing has stopped,
but the arrogance that produced it survives, and so does the agony,
the guilt and the separation.''
   McGovern drew applause when he said the nation should never
pursue military action counter to the public sentiment.
   ``It's important to our democracy that military operations
should be halted if they run counter to the wishes of the American
people.''
   Florence Schroeder, mother of slain student Bill Schroeder,
thanked the university for building the memorial.
   The memorial, on 2{ acres adjacent to the parking lot where the
students were killed, includes a granite plaza with four pylons
similar in shape to elongated gravestones.
   A smaller, waist-high marker, was erected in honor of the slain
students in 1971.
   ``We think this is a fine memorial,'' Mrs. Schroeder told the
crowd.
   Although she and her husband, Louis, participated in the
ceremony, the families of two other slain students _ Allison Krause
and Jeffrey Miller _ did not show up, university spokeswoman Janet
Thiede said.
   The parents of the fourth victim, Sandra Scheuer, were on campus
but did not speak at the ceremonies.
   Ms. Krause's mother, Doris Krause of Monroeville, Pa., had said
she did not plan to attend because she believed the memorial should
have been bigger and built earlier.
   The memorial was designed by Chicago architect Bruno Ast, and
was scaled down from a proposed $1 million memorial. The university
said it was unable to raise the money.
   Dean Kahler, who was paralyzed from the waist down when he was
wounded in the shootings, said he has forgiven the guardsmen but
added that the memorial's message was important. ``The injustices
that were committed here should never be forgotten,'' he said.
   Kahler, now an Athens County commissioner in southeast Ohio,
said he ``could not be an angry, bitter man.''
   He was the only student disabled by his wounds.
   Gov. Richard Celeste read the dead students' names and said each
time, ``I am sorry.''
   ``I felt disbelief that we had turned our weapons on our own
children.''
   The governor at the time of the shootings was James A. Rhodes,
who ordered the National Guard to restore order on the campus after
an ROTC building was set on fire in protest against the U.S.
invasion of Cambodia. He later signed a statement along with
National Guardsmen expressing regret.
   Mrs. Schroeder said she did not accept Rhodes' contention that
the statement did not amount to an admission of guilt. ``Their
signatures betray them,'' she said.
   Shortly after the shootings, a Portage County special grand jury
found that the guardsmen acted in self-defense and exonerated them
of criminal charges. In March 1974, a federal grand jury in
Cleveland indicted eight guardsmen on charges of violating the
civil rights of the dead and wounded students. A judge later
dismissed the charges for lack of evidence.
   University President Michael Schwartz said Rhodes and the
guardsmen involved in the shootings had not been individually
invited to the dedication. But he said an open letter the
university published as full-page advertisements in newspapers was
an invitation to all Ohioans.
   The office of the Ohio adjutant general, which oversees the
guard, said it had no comment or statement on the anniversary.
   Schwartz said the Kent State community felt a kinship with
Chinese students who were attacked by the military during a
demonstration in Tiananmen Square in Beijing last year.
   ``Those students were seeking democracy. Our students were
practicing it,'' he said.
   Wu'er Kaixi, a Tiananmen Square demonstration leader who later
fled China, was invited to the Kent State events and took part in a
candlelight vigil early Friday.

   Here is a text of President Bush's
commencement address Friday at Oklahoma State University:
   You know, when graduates of my vintage were sitting through
ceremonies like this right after the second World War, we faced a
world of changes, full of potential and new possibilities. And
Barbara and I got into a red two-door Studebaker _ you still drive
those, don't you, around here? But nevertheless, we drove from
Connecticut down to West Texas. I have often wondered how far I'd
have gone if I'd made it on up to Oklahoma.
   Post-war America was ready back then in 1948 for peace and
prosperity. But while the free world was recovering, the nations of
Eastern Europe were being ``consolidated'' behind an Iron Curtain.
And so began four decades of division in Europe _ 40 long years of
suspicion between two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United
States.
   And today, you also graduate at the end of an era of conflict _
but a contest of a different kind _ a cold and abstract war of
words and walls. And now Europe, and the world, have entered a new
era _ the age of freedom. And I hope you'll forgive me if I use
this great forum, at your great university, to handle a subject of
a very serious nature.
   It may be a little longer than you want to hear. I remember the
graduation at Yale University, my school, the man giving the
graduate speech got up and he said, ```Y' is for youth.'' And he
talked about 25 minutes. ```A' is for altruism.'' Another 32
minutes. ```L' is loyalty.'' He brushed that one off in 20 minutes.
```E' is for excellence.'' And when he finished there was one kid
out here in the audience. Everyone else had fled.
   He looked like he was praying. And the speaker said to him,
``Well, I'm glad you're saying a prayer. What are you praying for,
son?'' He said, ``I'm praying to God and giving thanks that you
didn't go to Oklahoma State University.''
   So, I _ but I want you to bear with me because I'll be
reflecting on the power and potential of democratic changes in
several of these commencement addresses that I make this year. And
I begin today, my very first, at your great university, with a few
words on _ few words on the changes and America's place in the new
Europe.
   A few of you may be wondering what a continent 4,000 miles away
has to do with you _ your class and you.
   Throughout our history, great upheavals in Europe have forced
the American people to respond, to make deep judgments about the
part we should play in European affairs. This has been true from
the time of the French Revolution and the war which followed it, to
World War I and the flawed peace which ended it, on to the Second
World War and the creation of the postwar order.
   And I believe that now we are poised at another such moment, a
critical time in our strategic relationship with our neighbors
across the Atlantic.
   Many of the graduates of America's class of 1916 have wondered
why the faraway war making headlines in their newspapers would have
anything to do with them. And they might have agreed with President
Wilson, who that year said ``We are not interested'' in the causes
of war, in ``the obscure foundations from which its stupendous
flood has burst forth.''
   But a year later those classmates, and their country, were swept
up in the torrent, carrying them to the horror of the trenches in
France. And yet after the war, we again turned away from active
involvement in European affairs. And instead, we sponsored a treaty
to outlaw war and then, as the outlaws gained strength, the United
States passed new neutrality laws.

<HEAD>New Round in Escalating Cigarette Export Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's reputation as a maker of live-saving
medical miracles is being tarnished with a new image as an exporter
of disease and death, critics of the nation's cigarette exports
said Friday.
   ``Free trade is not a license to export lung cancer or ride
roughshod over the anti-smoking laws of other nations,'' Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told a hearing of the Labor and Human
Resources Committee he chairs.
   Kennedy sided strongly with critics of the industry in a growing
debate over whether the U.S. government should continue seeking
expanded foreign markets for American cigarettes.
   The House has scheduled committee hearings later this month on
legislation to prohibit such trade promotion and to require on U.S.
brands sold abroad the same health warning that appears on
cigarette packages in the United States.
   Friday's hearing was the first airing of the issue in the
Senate, where legislation has not yet been proposed.
   The government's success in opening markets to U.S. cigarette
brands in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and a current effort in
Thailand drew strong praise and support from witnesses representing
the cigarette industry and tobacco-growing states and in a letter
earlier this week from House members to Ambassador Carla Hills, the
U.S. trade representative.
   Their message was that the dispute is not a health issue but a
question of fair trade, of gaining equal rights for U.S. brands to
be sold to people who will continue to use a legal product,
tobacco, regardless of what country it comes from.
   ``Millions of people around the world smoke and will continue to
smoke whether or not American cigarettes are available,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., one of several legislators testifying from
tobacco-growing states.
   Tobacco was one of the few U.S. exports earning a surplus _ more
than $4.2 billion _ last year to help offset the $109 billion U.S.
trade deficit, he said.
   Accusing the Thai government of hypocrisy, McConnell charged
that it is protecting its tobacco monopoly and planning to expand
its own exports yet ``has the audacity to ask us not to export
cigarettes to Thailand'' for health reasons.
   Dr. Prakit Vathesatogut, director of the Thai Anti-Smoking
Coalition, displayed to the committee shirts and caps bearing the
Marlboro and Winston brand names, which he said are handed out in
Thailand, and Thai advertising depicting smoking as part of a
youthful American image.
   ``In the modern-day equivalent of the Opium Wars, our government
is aiming to unleash the Marlboro Man on the Thai citizenry,'' said
Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., a sponsor of the House legislation.
   The Opium War between Britan and China was fought from 1839 to
1842 over the right of British traders based in India to ship opium
to China. China, which sought to ban the import of opium, lost, and
was forced to permit the opium trade for decades.

   Another generation of Americans sat in the bright sun of
commencement ceremonies at colleges all across the country,
thinking war in Europe would somehow pass them by.
   But when war came, they paid an awful price, a horrible price,
for America's isolation. And then when the war ended, those
students who no longer questioned our role in the future of Europe,
they no longer asked what Europe had to do with them, because they
knew the answer: everything.
   About a year ago, in Germany, I defined the kind of Europe our
country is committed to: a peaceful, stable Europe, a Europe what I
call whole and free.
   Today that goal is within our reach. We're entering a new age of
freedom in a time of uncertainty but great hope.
   Emerging democracies in Eastern Europe are going through social,
political, and economic transformations shaking loose stagnant,
centralized bureaucracies that have smothered initiative for
generations. And in this time of transition, moving away from the
post-war era and beyond containment, we cannot know what choices
the people of Eastern Europe will make for their future.
   The process of change in the Soviet Union is also still
unfinished. It will be crucial to see, for example, whether Moscow
chooses coercion or peaceful dialogue in responding to the
aspirations of the Lithuanian people and nationalities within the
Soviet Union.
   The only noble answer lies in a dialogue that results in
unencumbered self-determination for Lithuania.
   President Gorbachev has made profound progress in his country,
reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned back. And
yet neither can we turn the clock ahead, to know for sure what kind
of country the Soviet Union will be in years to come.
   And for the sake of the future we share with Europe, our
policies and presence must be appropriate for this period of
transition _ with a constancy and reliability that will reassure
our friends, both old and new. My European colleagues want the
United States to be a part of Europe's future and I believe they're
right.
   The United States should remain a European power in the broadest
sense _ politically, militarily, economically. And as part of our
global responsibilities, the foundation for America's peaceful
engagement in Europe has been, and will continue to be, NATO.
   Recognizing in peace what we learned from war, we joined with
the free nations of Europe to form an Atlantic Community, an
enduring political compact. Our engagement in Europe has meant that
Europeans accept America as part of their continent's future,
taking our interests into account across the board. Our commitment
is not just in defense; it must be a well-balanced mix of
involvement in all dimensions of European affairs.
   Because of our political commitment to peace in Europe, there
hasn't been a war on the continent in 45 years. Think of your
history books _ not a war on the continent in 45 years. This long
peace should be viewed through the long lens of history then.
Europe has now experienced the longest uninterrupted period of
international peace in the recorded history of that continent.
   Now the alliance _ the alliance is now ready to build on that
historic achievement and define its objectives for the next
century. So the alliance must join together to craft a new Western
strategy for new and changing times.
   Having consulted intensively with Prime Minister Thatcher
recently there in Bermuda and President Mitterrand in Key Largo in
Florida and Chancellor Helmut Kohl up in Camp David, and by
telephone or cable with NATO Secretary General Woerner and all of
my other allied colleagues, I am calling for an early summit of all
NATO leaders.
   Margaret Thatcher, one of freedom's greatest champions of the
last decade, told me that, while NATO has been fantastically
successful, we should be ready now to face new challenges. The time
is right for the alliance to act.
   The fundamental purpose of this summit should be to launch a
wide-ranging NATO Strategy Review for the transformed Europe of the
1990s, and to my NATO colleagues, I suggest that our summit direct
this review by addressing four critical points: one, the political
role that NATO can play in Europe; two, the conventional forces the
alliance will need in the time ahead, and NATO's goal for
conventional arms control; three, the role of nuclear weapons based
in Europe and Western objectives in new nuclear arms control
negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union; and,
four, strengthening the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe _ CSCE _ to reinforce NATO and help protect democratic
values, in a Europe that is whole and free.

   The nation's unemployment rate climbed to 5.4
percent in April, its highest level in more than a year, the
government said Friday in a report analysts called a disturbing
sign the economy could slip into recession.
   There was paltry growth in the number of U.S. jobs for the
second straight month, and the total actually would have declined
if not for the hiring of temporary census workers.
   ``The report indicates the bottom dropped out of the labor
market in April. It speaks more toward a possible recession than a
rebounding economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co.
   Added Robert Dederick of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago:
   ``I don't think we can say the economy is toppling over a cliff,
but it is not showing any signs that it's backing away from the
cliff, either, so there's that danger.''
   Bond markets rallied in response to the report. Traders took
weaker-than-expected employment _ a report running counter to
recent indications that the economy was picking up _ as a sign the
Federal Reserve would not boost interest rates to slow things down.
The government reported last week that the economy grew at a 2.1
percent rate in the first three months of the year, twice as fast
as some private analysts had predicted.
   On Wall Street, stocks rose 14.19 points, although brokers said
the unemployment report also raised some fresh doubts about the
outlook for economic growth and corporate profits in coming months.
   In April, the civilian jobless rate as measured by a household
survey was up from the 5.2 percent registered in March. Before
that, the unemployment rate had held steady at 5.3 percent for nine
months.
   The last time the jobless rate reached 5.4 percent was January
1989.
   The number of new jobs created edged up only slightly, with a
net gain of 64,000. That included the government's hiring of 78,000
workers for the 1990 census.
   The job growth figure is derived from a separate survey of
business establishments and is generally considered a more reliable
indicator of economic activity than the household survey on
unemployment.
   The nation's factories, in a slump for months, continued to
falter as manufacturing jobs fell by 22,000. It was the 12th
decline in 13 months.
   ``The manufacturing sector is continuing to bleed workers ...
it's starting to have a debilitating affect in other areas as
well,'' Dederick said.
   The manufacturing pinch is starting to spill over into areas
such as business services, which includes such jobs as caterers and
security guards, Dederick said. That sector suffered a 13,000 job
loss last month.
   The biggest payroll drop in April came in construction, with a
seasonably adjusted fall of 99,000 jobs. Construction jobs had been
inflated early in the year by unusually warm weather.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
noted that job growth was robust in the first two months of the
year as about 700,000 new jobs were created.
   That means that since January, the economy has produced an
average of 175,000 new jobs a month, she said. A year ago at this
time, the economy had produced a monthly average of 200,000 jobs,
while the 1988 average for the first four months was 275,000.
   Ms. Norwood said the slowdown is ``not particularly surprising
after more than seven years of business expansion.''
   Meanwhile, the service sector, which has been carrying the
economy, added 179,000 jobs, bolstered by the hiring of temporary
census workers.
   Labor costs, which have been speeding upward and are blamed for
worsening the nation's inflation problems, continued to increase,
although moderately, the report showed.
   Average hourly earnings rose to $9.95 from $9.92, at least
partly because of the April 1 increase in the minimum wage from
$3.35 an hour to $3.85.
   Overall, total civilian employment declined slightly to 118.1
million in April. The jobless numbered 6.8 million, up from the 6.5
million out-of-work Americans in March.
   Many economists had predicted the nation's unemployment rate
would eventually creep up this year. Since mid-1988, the rate has
ranged between 5 percent and 5.5 percent, the lowest range since
the early 1970s.
   Some analysts said Friday's report was not a sign of a sudden
collapse.
   ``I think the numbers are finally catching up with reality. It
looks to me as though we have slow but positive growth,'' said
Cynthia Latta of DRI-McGraw Hill.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the April
jobless rate was 5.3 percent, up from 5.1 percent in March.

   Now, the first task the NATO summit should consider is the
future political mission of the alliance. As military threats fade,
the political dimension of NATO's work, always there but seldom
noticed, becomes more prominent.
   And so at the NATO summit we should look for ways to help our
German friends sustain freedom and achieve German unity, something
which we and our allies have supported for over 40 years. And we
should reaffirm the importance of keeping a united Germany as a
full member of NATO.
   The alliance needs to find ways to work more closely with a
vigorous European Community that is rightly asserting its own
distinct views. And in Eastern Europe, governments once our
adversaries are now our partners in building a new continent.
   And so we must also talk about how to encourage further peaceful
democratic change in Eastern Europe and inside the Soviet Union.
   But even as NATO gives more emphasis to its political mission,
its guarantee of European security must remain firm. You see, our
enemy today _ if you think about, what's the enemy today? Our enemy
today is uncertainty and instability. And so the alliance will need
to maintain a sound, collective military structure with forces in
the field, backed by larger forces that can be called upon in some
crisis.
   And which brings me then to the second task for the NATO summit,
a review of how the alliance should plan its conventional defenses.
While we need to recognize that it will take some time before the
Soviet military presence is gone from Eastern Europe _ before those
Soviet troops are taken out of Eastern Europe, and before the major
reductions contemplated by both sides can be implemented _ we need
to develop our strategy for that world now.
   Obviously, as I look at the equation, Soviet actions, what the
Russians do, will be critical. And yet even after all the planned
reductions in its forces are complete, even if our current arms
control proposals are agreed to and implemented, the Soviet
military will still field forces dwarfing those of any other single
European state, armed with thousands of nuclear weapons.
   Militarily significant US forces must remain on the other side
of the Atlantic for as long as our allies want and need them. And
these forces demonstrate, as no words can, the enduring political
compact that binds America's fate with Europe's democracies.
   If the Soviet withdrawal continues and our arms control efforts
are successful, we must plan for a different kind of military
presence focused less on the danger of an immediate outbreak of
war. And we must promote long-term stability and prevent crises
from escalating by relying on reduced forces that show our
capability and our readiness to respond to whatever may arise.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which we have
proposed, would be the most ambitious conventional arms control
agreement ever concluded. And we must finish the work on this
treaty soon, and plan to sign it at the CSCE summit this fall. But
at the NATO summit, we need to look further ahead, preparing
follow-on negotiations after the conclusion of the CFE treaty.
   And the NATO summit should develop the Alliance's objectives for
these talks.
   And third, the NATO summit should also assess the future of US
nuclear forces in Europe. As democracy blooms in Eastern Europe, as
Soviet troops return home and tanks are destroyed, dismantled,
there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest range. And
the NATO summit should accelerate ongoing work within the Alliance
to determine the minimum number and types of weapons that will be
needed to deter war _ credibly and effectively.
   In light of these new political conditions, and the limited
range and flexibility of these short-range nuclear missile forces
based in Europe, I've reviewed our plan to produce and deploy
newer, more modern, short-range nuclear missiles to replace the
Lance system that's now in Europe.
   We've almost finished the R&amp;D, research and development work for
these new missiles. But I've decided, after consultation with our
allies, to terminate the follow-on to Lance Program. I have also
decided to cancel any further modernization of US nuclear artillery
shells deployed in Europe.

   Latvian lawmakers voted for independence
Friday but plotted a more cautious break from the Soviet Union than
neighboring Lithuania. Latvians greeted the declaration of
independence with tears, a chorus of the republic's traditional
anthem and dancing in the streets.
   The 138-0 parliamentary vote, 50 years after Moscow seized the
three Baltic states on the Soviet's western border, put Latvia on a
similar secessionist path with Lithuania and Estonia.
   However, unlike Lithuania's independence declaration of March
11, the vote by Latvia's Supreme Soviet called for a gradual break
with the Soviet Union.
   Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov said he was already thinking
about the next step: negotiations with Moscow.
   ``Everything is ahead,'' he said. ``This is only the very, very
beginning.''
   Gorbunov later was asked at a news conference what reaction he
expected from the Kremlin. He said he could not predict what Moscow
would say, but he added that the Latvian government had tried to
make it clear in the declaration that there is ``no cause to close
the door on dialogue and start setting ultimatums.''
   Fifty-seven anti-independence lawmakers refused to cast ballots.
Even so, the measure had no problem achieving the two-thirds
majority needed for approval.
   After the vote was announced, Latvians inside and outside the
hall broke into a chorus of ``God Bless Latvia,'' the republic's
traditional anthem. A cheering crowd showered emerging lawmakers
with roses, pansies and daffodils.
   The deputies also voted to drop the words ``Soviet Socialist''
from the republic's name, making it simply ``The Republic of
Latvia.''
   ``I waited my whole life for this,'' said Ilma Kaminska, 65, who
said she remembered when Latvia was forcibly annexed by Joseph
Stalin in 1940.
   ``I believed, I always believed,'' she said tearfully.
   The bill, proposed by the pro-independence Latvian People's
Front that dominates the parliament, proclaimed the start of an
unspecified period of transition to full independence. In the
interim, it calls for negotiations with Moscow.
   The neighboring republic of Estonia took a similar step March 30.
   Lithuania, which declared full independence seven weeks ago, is
now suffering a Kremlin-imposed economic blockade of oil, natural
gas and other raw materials.
   Friday evening, tens of thousands of people gathered on the
banks of Riga's Daugava River, long a national symbol for Latvians.
   With the setting sun glinting on the river, red and white
Latvian flags fluttered above the singing crowd.
   ``My people, you are free! Live and act like a people who
deserve to be free,'' said Dainis Ivans, chairman of the Latvian
Popular Front.
   Hours later, scores of people danced in the streets of central
Riga. Scattered fireworks exploded in the night sky.
   Two deputies walked out of the session during the vote,
including Alfreds Rubiks, Latvia's Communist Party chief, who
earlier in the day warned that ethnic Russians and other
non-Latvians living in the republic opposed the measure.
   ``They will express themselves in mass demonstrations and
political strikes in all the cities,'' he said.
   The party chief also said anti-independence forces would appeal
to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to impose presidential
rule, and said there ought to be a popular referendum on the
independence question.
   Members of Latvia's opposition complained they were not given
enough time to study the declaration. Some warned that Moscow would
respond to the move with heavy pressure to rescind it.
   ``If we pass this declaration, Moscow will do the same thing to
Latvia'' as to Lithuania, said deputy Leonids Alksnis.
   Other speakers, however, cast the declaration as a means to
avoid being overwhelmed demographically. Latvians are close to
becoming a minority on their own territory.
   ``This is our last possibility to survive, and we are going to
take advantage of it. That is why we demand independence,'' said
writer Alberts Bels.
   In Lithuania, 80 percent of the 3.8 million people are ethnic
Lithuanians. But only about 54 percent of Latvia's 2.7 million
people are ethnic Latvians. Most of the rest are ethnic Russians,
many of whom oppose independence.
   A day earlier, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis had
advised his neighbors to ``be strong and have courage.'' On Friday,
his deputy prime minister, Algirdas Brazauskas, reported that the
economic embargo was making life in Lithuania ``more difficult,''
and appealed for ``substantial aid'' from abroad.
   Latvia has followed Lithuania's lead on many issues. In
December, it abolished the Communist Party's guaranteed monopoly on
power; in February it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its
annexation by the Soviet Union; and last month a large segment of
its Communist Party broke from its Moscow-based parent.
   The independence measure adopts four articles from the
republic's 1922 constitution: establishing an independent and
democratic republic, the historic territory of Latvia, giving power
to the people, and establishing a sovereign Latvian parliament.
   It also recognizes the legitimacy of Soviet laws that do not
contradict the republic's own laws.
   The deputies drafted a message reassuring Gorbachev that a
declaration of independence ``only opens the door to a transition
period _ a period of honest dialogue and a working out of mutual
interests.''
   But they added that ``the people of Latvia have no stronger
desire than to restore its democratic statehood. It never
reconciled itself to the loss (of statehood) and will never give up
this goal.
   ``We are hoping, Mikhail Sergeyevich, for your governmental
understanding of Latvia's choice since we believe the road of
changes for you and the nation that was started by you will remain
unchanged in the future.''
   Gorbunov, who was re-elected president of Latvia on Thursday,
said in his nominating speech that Latvia could not expect help
from the West.
   ``The world, on account of 5 million Baltic people, is not going
to risk what has been done in the area of arms control and by
Mikhail Gorbachev,'' he said.

   Now, these _ there are still short-range US _ and many more
Soviet _ nuclear missile systems deployed in Europe, and we're
prepared to negotiate the reduction of these forces as well as a
set of arms control _ new set of arms control talks.
   At the NATO summit, I will urge my colleagues to agree on the
broad objectives for these future US-Soviet negotiations and begin
preparations within the alliance for these talks. I would also like
to suggest that these new US-Soviet arms control talks begin
shortly after the CFE treaty on conventional forces has been signed.
   In taking these steps, the United States is not going to allow
Europe to become ``safe for conventional war.''
   There are few lessons so clear in history as this: Only the
combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces have ensured
this long peace in Europe. But every aspect of America's engagement
in Europe _ military, political, economic _ must be complementary,
and one place where they all come together is in the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, an organization of 35 states of
Europe and North America. The CSCE is already a beacon for human
rights and individual freedoms, and now it must take on a broader
role.
   And so, the fourth task for this NATO summit I'm calling for is
to reach common allied objectives for the future of CSCE itself. It
can help the victorious forces of democracy in Eastern Europe
secure their revolutions, and _ as they join the commonwealth of
free nations _ be assured a voice in the new Europe.
   And the CSCE should offer new guidelines for building free
societies, including setting standards for truly free elections,
adopting measures to strengthen the rule of law, and pointing the
way in the needed but painful transition from centralized, command
economies to the free markets.
   The CSCE can also provide a forum for political dialogue in a
more united Europe. And I agree with those who have called for
regular consultations among senior representatives of the CSCE
countries.
   We should consider whether new CSCE mechanisms can help mediate
and settle disputes in Europe. And I believe my Allied colleagues
and I should agree to take up these new ideas at a CSCE summit
later this year, in conjunction with the signing of the treaty I
talked to you about, that conventional force treaty, the CFE treaty.
   In Eastern Europe, in this hemisphere, the triumph of democracy
has cast its warm light on the face of the world like a miraculous
dawn. But the outcome of this struggle for freedom is not ordained,
and it's not going to be the work of miracles.
   All of you who graduate here today are part of a historic
decision for America's engagement in the future of Europe. And I am
convinced that our work to protect freedom, to build free
societies, will safeguard our own peace and prosperity.
   The security of Europe and the world has become very complex in
this century. But America's commitment to stability and peace is
profoundly clear. And its motivation derives from the strength of
our forefathers _ from the blood of those who have died for freedom
_ and for the sake of all who would live in peace.
   And as you leave this great university, every voice, every
heart's commitment to freedom, is important. There's a story, about
man trying to convince his son that in the struggle for freedom,
every voice counts.
   And they stood in a valley, watching the snow fall on a distant
mountain. It might have been a day like today. But they stood there
_ ``Tell me the weight of a snowflake,'' the man said.
   ``Almost nothing,'' answered the boy.
   As the snow swirled around them, up on the mountain they saw an
avalanche whose thunder shook the earth.
   ``Do you know which snowflake caused that?'' the old man asked.
   ``I don't,'' answered the boy.
   ``Maybe,'' said the man, ``like the last snowflake that moves a
mountain in the struggle for freedom, a single voice makes a world
of difference.''
   America's mission in Europe, like millions of individual
decisions made for freedom, can make a voice, can make a world of
difference. The cry for freedom in Eastern Europe, in South Africa,
right here in our precious hemisphere to our south, was heard
around the world in the revolution of 1989.
   And today, in this new age of freedom, add your voices to the
thundering chorus.
   It's a great honor for me to have been at this University. Thank
you very much. God bless you, and God bless the United States of
America.
   Thank you all. Thank you so much. Thank you.

   A train carrying about 200 passengers left
the rails and fell into a dry riverbed in mountainous Oaxaca state
in the south, killing at least six people and hurting at least 40,
the Mexican Red Cross said Friday.
   Oaxacan station chief Jose Velasco Altamirano said the entire
train _ two engines, two passenger cars and one freight car _ left
the tracks Thursday night, apparently because of brake failure.
   The train was bound from the state capital of Oaxaca city to
Mexico City, a trip of about 220 miles, when the derailment
occurred at Cuicatlan village.
   No foreigners were reported aboard.

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 human skulls have been found
in caves near a guerrilla camp high in the Andean mountains, but
authorities said they did not know who the dead were.
   A medical examiner who accompanied an army patrol to the caves
said some of the victims had died violently, and in the past two
years, but that other remains might be hundreds of years old.
   Army sources said some of the bones may be those of rebels
fatally wounded in clashes with the military and the police. Others
may be those of guerrillas who tried to desert or of peasants
kidnapped from nearby villages.
   The caves are located 14,200 feet above sea level, 20 miles
north of this Andean city. Ayacucho is the birthplace of the
Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrilla movement and rebels control
much of the surrounding countryside.
   The skulls and other human bones were found last month by a
civil defense group on the lookout for Shining Path rebels. Near
the caves the group found 200 sticks of dynamite, medicines,
knives, and rebel propaganda.
   A military patrol from Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima,
went to investigate the group's findings. The patrol, accompanied
by an Associated Press reporter, returned to Ayacucho Friday.
   The medical examiner, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
many of the bones in the two caves were quite old, and could have
been placed there hundreds of years ago.
   He said he was unable to count the exact number of skulls of
recent origin.
   But some of the recently dead apparently were killed by bullet
or machete wounds, the examiner said.
   More than 18,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path began its armed insurgency 10 years ago.

   Police clubbed demonstrators Friday
and hauled some off to jail during protests over observing the 10th
anniversary of the death of Josip Tito, the founding father of
Communist Yugoslavia.
   Police also broke into a school and detained pupils who ripped
Tito pictures off the wall and destroyed them.
   The incidents took place as factory sirens wailed at 3:05 p.m. _
a signal to mark the hour of Tito's death on May 4, 1980, at age 87.
   Passers-by mostly ignored the sirens and teen-agers continued
enjoying their ice cream.
   In previous years, Yugoslavs stood still and observed a minute
of silence.
   This time police fought members of the Serbian Radical Party in
Belgrade, arresting people who kept yelling, ``Down with the
Communists! Out of Serbia!''
   Shouts against hard-line Serbian Communist leader Slobodan
Milosevic also were heard.
   No official word came on the number of arrests or possible
injuries, but witnesses said some police action was brutal.
   Protesters tore up and threw in the air old 500-dinar banknotes
bearing Tito's image _ now almost worthless following 2,500 percent
inflation.
   Police forced a photographer taking pictures of demonstrators
being pushed into a police van to expose his film to light.
   Demonstrators were seen pulling off a Marshal Tito street sign
in downtown Belgrade.
   The main street of every city, town and village in Yugoslavia is
named after Tito.
   About 200 Radical Party members and other Yugoslavs opposed to
continuing public veneration of Tito unfurled a Serbian flag in
front of Parliament and carried a placard reading, ``Exterminate
the evil'' (communism).
   For almost 45 years, Tito has been officially revered for his
role in fighting the Nazis in World War II, for his break with
Moscow in 1948, and for guiding Yugoslavia into the non-aligned
movement in the 1960s.
   But now, many Yugoslavs feel their current ethnic, economic and
political troubles took root during Tito's rule, They blame the
weak, decentralized leadership system he bequeathed for many of the
problems.
   Parliament is expected to decide soon to annul a law that makes
it a criminal offense to criticize Tito or his policies.
   Criticism of Tito has centered recently on his authoritarian
style of rule.
   He is now openly charged with setting up a death camp on an
island off the central Adriatic coast in which more than 5,000
pro-Soviet Communists died after Tito took Yugoslavia out of the
Soviet orbit.
   In his native Croatia, Tito is criticized by those he purged as
nationalists in 1971. Several are successfully returning to
politics now that Croatia and Slovenia have embraced multiparty
systems and free elections.
   In Serbia, which still advocates Communism, nationalism has
grown over the past two years, fueling criticism of Tito, the Croat.
   Serbs allege that Tito's rule gave Croatia and Slovenia, the two
most developed of Yugoslavia's six republics, unfair economic
advantages.
   Serbia's Communist Party, staking its fate on the popularity of
Serbian President Milosevic, on Friday promised free, democratic
elections in Yugoslavia's largest republic within six months.
   In Slovenia, Croatia and other parts of Yugoslavia, several
peaceful, memorial gatherings were held to commemorate Tito,
particularly in the armed forces, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.

   Enraged students took control of Mills
College on Friday, staging sit-ins and blockades they vowed would
continue until the exclusive women's school reverses a decision to
admit men.
   The noisy but non-violent demonstrators conducted a sit-in at
the office of Mills President Mary Metz and shut down classes at
the normally quiet, tree-lined liberal arts college. Most teachers
supported the disruption, which could last until the May 20
graduation.
   Students, wearing signs demanding the resignation of board of
trustees chairman Warren Hellman, even drove Metz from her home
about 9 a.m. with blaring horns and music and cries of ``We Will
Not Accept This.''
   ``We're shutting them down,'' said Thomlyn Gingell, a sophomore
art history major. ``We haven't been listened to. Maybe this will
make them listen.''
   But administrators, who couldn't get to their offices because of
student blockades and sit-ins involving several hundred of the 777
undergraduate women, said the board of trustees wouldn't change its
mind.
   The board, citing declining enrollment and revenues, voted
Thursday night to accept men as undergraduates, bringing an end to
Mills' 138-year policy of admitting only women.
   ``No one was happy with the decision, but we believe that life
goes on,'' said Metz, who agreed to meet with students Friday and
again Tuesday to discuss the decision to go co-ed.
   ``I don't believe the board will reverse itself,'' she said. ``I
hope this grieving starts the healing process.''
   While students protested, members of the Mills College Alumnae
Association held what they described as a ``wake'' at the group's
campus office. After the trustees' vote, the alumnae group decided
to consult an attorney to see if Mills students can sue the school
to keep from going co-ed in the fall of 1991.
   Marge Thomas, of the graduate class of 1963, said alumnae don't
believe they can get the trustees to reverse their decision, but
that maybe the board will approve waiting to go co-ed until after
the 1990 first-year students are graduated.
   ``They came here to go to a women's college and they should be
allowed to finish in a women's college,'' Thomas said.
   Many women at Mills said they would not return next year because
of the trustees' vote.
   ``I can't believe they would ignore us like that,'' said Amy
Hutto, one of a handful of undergraduates who shaved their heads in
protest.
   Enrollment in Mills' 33 undergraduate programs is down 4.2
percent from three years ago and below the 1,000 students needed to
balance the $24 million annual budget, economists at the school
said. Tuition at Mills is almost $12,000.
   Mills is the only single-sex learning institution in Northern
California. Two women's colleges are located in Southern California
and 94 remain nationwide.

   The government and the African
National Congress said Friday they will work together for the first
time to stop political violence and clear the way for talks on
ending white-minority rule.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela, looking
relaxed and confident after the three days of talks, said the
preliminary discussions were an important step toward giving South
Africa's black majority a share of power.
   ``It is the realization of a dream for which we have worked
patiently and consistently,'' Mandela said after the first talks
ever between the ANC and government.
   In a joint communique, the sides said a ``working group'' will
be created to try to end obstacles to full negotiations on changing
the constitution.
   In a major clause, the communique said the government
``reiterates its commitment to work toward lifting'' the nearly
4-year-old state of emergency. The lifting of the emergency is one
of the ANC's demands before constitutional negotiations can begin.
   The communique indicated the delegations made progress on most
other issues as well. Among them, it said the government will
consider ``urgently granting'' temporary immunity from prosecution
to ANC executive members in exile. This would enable them to return
to South Africa to help end political violence.
   The granting of immunity to ANC exiles has been another demand
of the African National Congress.
   ``I regard what is contained in this document as an important
breakthrough in the peaceful process we want to take place in South
Africa,'' de Klerk said.
   He said no agreement had been made on further talks, but the
working group would report by May 21 and both sides hoped for quick
progress.
   In Washington, the United States hailed the ``courageous
decision'' by the sides to work toward further talks.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in London to receive an award,
warmly welcomed the outcome of talks.
   ``We are very thrilled with the way things seem to have
developed,'' the Nobel laureate said, smiling broadly. ``I think
the way things have gone has exceeded our highest hopes.''
   This week's talks were an attempt to clear obstacles standing in
the way of formal negotiations on changing the constitution to give
the black majority a voice in national affairs.
   In addition to lifting the state of emergency, the ANC wants the
release of all political prisoners and the return from exile of top
ANC officials without fear of prosecution.
   The state of emergency has been in effect since June 1986, and
the ANC says it is used by police to suppress political activity
and peaceful dissent.
   The government says it wants to lift the emergency, but that it
remains necessary to combat black factional fighting that has
claimed more than 600 lives this year, many in the southeastern
province of Natal.
   The communique stressed the need to end that political violence,
which pits rival Zulu factions against each other.
   The government also has demanded the ANC renounce its largely
ineffective guerrilla war.
   ``The ANC will therefore look into the question of the armed
struggle and take appropriate decisions,'' Mandela said.
   While the two sides appear to have made progress, both stressed
that extremely difficult and long negotiations lie ahead before
there can be any hope of a peaceful settlement.
   De Klerk has rejected majority rule for South Africa's 28
million blacks and says there must be safeguards for the 5 million
whites and other minorities, including veto power over government
decisions. The ANC insists it wants full democracy with no special
privileges for any group.
   The two leaders, who shook hands and smiled in front of news
cameras, disagreed during the news conference on several issues,
including apartheid and international economic sanctions.
   Asked if apartheid was dead in South Africa, Mandela replied,
``I must tell you what I have told the state president and his
delegation: that 27 years ago when I went to jail I had no vote and
27 years thereafter I still have no vote and that is due to the
color of my skin.''
   De Klerk released Mandela in February after he had served 27
years of a life term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the
government.
   De Klerk responded that talks would be needed before blacks
would get to vote. ``While apartheid is going in South Africa, the
anti-apartheid movements are keeping it alive,'' he said without
further explanation.
   But Mandela also was quick to praise de Klerk, saying, ``I have
not the slightest doubt that the state president means what he
says. And I have no doubt whatsoever about their (the government's)
integrity,'' he said.
   Mandela said the ANC would not ask the international community
for more economic sanctions against South Africa, but he also said
there would be no call to ease or end the sanctions.
   De Klerk said sanctions were not in the interests of South
Africa.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acting chief of the Drug Enforcement
Administration wants to shift some top deputies in a personnel
shuffle that would include transfer for a man considered a
competitor for the top job.
   Acting DEA Administrator Terrence Burke is preparing to formally
propose the changes to the Justice Department, DEA spokesman Frank
Shults said Friday.
   Shults said the proposed changes would be normal rotations and
would not reflect a change in policies.
   The most visible change proposed by Burke would shift David
Westrate from assistant administrator in charge of operations to
assistant administrator for planning and inspection.
   Westrate, one of the DEA's chief spokesmen on Capitol Hill, was
Burke's boss until Burke was named deputy administrator of the DEA
last year. Burke has become acting administrator since the
retirement of former Administrator John C. Lawn.
   The Bush administration has not yet nominated a permanent
replacement for Lawn. But both Westrate and Burke are among those
being considered for the job, according to Justice Department
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Westrate has held the job directing DEA's worldwide operations
since August 1985, and has generally spoken for the DEA at
congressional hearings.
   Replacing Westrate as operations director would be Stephen H.
Greene, who has been Westrate's deputy for about a year, said
Shults. Greene was also Burke's replacement when Burke became
deputy administrator to Lawn.
   Peter F. Gruden, who has been assistant administrator for
planning and inspection for several years, would become the special
agent in charge of the Washington field office, Shults said.
   The chief of the Washington field office, Ronald J. Caffrey,
would replace Greene as the deputy assistant administrator for
operations under Burke's reorgnization.
   ``Our agents normally rotate to different jobs every two to
three years,'' Shults said. ``Executives don't rotate that often
because there aren't that many jobs available for them.''
   Shults said these latest moves ``don't mean anything'' in terms
of change in DEA policy and are not meant to be critical of
anyone's performance.

   About 200 armed men surrounded a Communist Party
building in the Armenian capital of Yerevan for hours Friday, but
dispersed peacefully after presenting a list of political demands,
authorities and witnesses said.
   No injuries were reported. The building houses the city party
committee.
   News photographer Garo Lachinian said by telephone that the
crowd of mostly young men carried weapons ranging from flintlocks
and knives to Kalashnikov assault rifles and that some took to
nearby rooftops while the rest surrounded the building in downtown
Yerevan.
   Members of the group called themselves the Armenian National
Army and presented a list of demands to party officials, said Ashot
Manucharyan of the Armenian National Movement.
   Manucharyan emphasized that his group was not connected with the
militants and disagrees with their tactics.
   The militants' demands ranged from withdrawal of all Soviet
troops from Armenia to a multiparty system in the republic and a
six-month postponement of May 20 legislative elections, Manucharyan
said in a telephone interview.
   On April 15, crowds attacked the KGB headquarters in Yerevan
with stones, torches and flare guns. That assault was said to have
been triggered by the arrest of Armenians on charges of stealing
weapons from a military unit. At least one person was killed and
another was badly wounded.
   Manucharyan said the militants organized in January, when many
firearms were stolen during ethnic clashes between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis in the two Caucasus republics.
   Gevorg Oganesyan, a spokesman for the regional party Central
Committee, said some armed men entered the building Friday and
ordered everyone out except for regional party officials, who were
presented with a list of their demands.
   Col. Grant Avakyan of the Armenian Interior Ministry said the
men left after talking with the party and local police, but kept
their weapons. He said the incident lasted about six hours.
   The men also want Soviet troops withdrawn from Nagorno-Karabakh,
a predominantly Armenian enclave within the republic of Azerbaijan,
said Dela Avetisyan, duty officer of Armenpress news agency in
Yerevan.
   Riots and attacks against KGB, government and party buildings
have occurred often in the southern Soviet Union in the past year.
Some attacks are aimed clearly at seizing arms, and others at
forcing force political change.

   Hostage Brian Keenan's two sisters flew to
Washington Friday to meet freed American hostage Frank Reed, who
was held with their brother and telephoned them to let them know
Keenan was well.
   The women said they wanted to hear more about the condition of
Keenan, who was abducted April 11, 1986, while walking to work at
the American University of Beirut.
   Keenan, an English teacher, holds dual Irish and British
citizenship.
   Reed, who was freed Monday, telephoned Brenda Gillham and Elaine
Spence on Thursday to tell them he had seen their 39-year-old
brother last Saturday.
   ``We want to meet the man in person, shake him by the hand and
thank him for the news that he brought us,'' Mrs. Gillham told
reporters as the sisters changed planes at London's Heathrow
Airport en route from their Belfast home to the United States.
   ``He has said that Brian is still strong-willed, so his
character doesn't seemed to have changed,'' Mrs. Gillham said. The
sisters said their five-day visit will include meetings with other
families of hostages.
   Mrs. Spence said she and her sister ``want to know if Brian has
talked about home and the family and we want to ask Frank what we
can do next to try to get Brian out.''
   Reed arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington
Friday, after several days' rest at a U.S. military hospital in
Wiesbaden, West Germany. Upon arrival, he paid tribute to all
hostage relatives, including Keenan's sisters, saying that because
of them, ``I am unchained and unblindfolded.''
   Mrs. Spence said she believed the Irish government was working
hard for the release of her brother, adding: ``I just hope this is
the start of a process which will bring them all home.''
   Reed said he had been held for six months with Keenan and
British journalist John McCarthy. He said both men were well
despite being chained and blindfolded.
   Before leaving West Germany, Reed said Britain should do more to
free the two.
   ``They are my best mates, those guys, we're going to get them
out,'' he said.
   McCarthy was kidnapped on his way to Beirut airport to leave the
country on April 17, 1986.
   Keenan and McCarthy are among 16 Westerners held hostages in
Lebanon. Six are American, including Associated Press correspondent
Terry Anderson, kidnapped in March 1985 and the longest held.

   Prosecutors in the drug trial of Mayor Marion
Barry argued Friday that they should not have to provide his
lawyers with copies of regulations that govern drug investigations
or all the fine details of the case against him.
   In another development in the case, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson set May 25 for a pre-trial hearing on a series of
motions by the mayor seeking dismissal of the eight criminal
charges against him.
   Barry's lawyers say he is the victim of prosecutorial
``overreach'' by a U.S. attorney's office that violated government
regulations in an FBI sting operation leading to the mayor's arrest.
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 after being videotaped smoking crack
cocaine in a room of a Washington hotel. He is accused of five
misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and three felony counts of
lying to a federal grand jury about involvement with drugs.
   In one of their motions, the mayor's lawyers said the government
had violated its own procedures in the arrest and demanded that the
goverment produce its regulations for undercover drug operations.
In a court filing Friday in reply, the government said Barry should
not be given the regulations.
   ``Even if there were a violation of an agency regulation _ and
the government vigorously denies that there was _ it would not
entitle'' Barry ``to any relief unless'' his constitutional rights
were violated, said prosecutors.
   Disclosing the guidelines ``could compromise ongoing and future
undercover operations if the confidential aspects of law
enforcement investigative techniques were publicly disclosed,''
they wrote.
   Barry seeks specific times of his alleged possessions of
cocaine, amounts of cocaine and descriptions of narcotics
paraphernalia, far more detail than the government is required to
produce before trial, said the prosecutors in opposing Barry's
motion for a bill of particulars of the charges against him.
   Barry ``has been informed of all tangible evidence, provided
copies of all laboratory reports, provided copies of his grand jury
testimony and given access to all of the Government's evidence''
that is required by federal court rules, said the government.
   Prosecutors noted a court case which concluded that if
defendants ``were given the minutiae they seek, the slightest
discrepancy between the particulars and the evidence at trial would
open the door'' to an attempt to confuse the jury.
   In a 1979 case, an Internal Revenue Service agent obtained
incriminating evidence against a defendant in a manner that
violated IRS regulations. The Supreme Court refused to suppress the
evidence, prosecutors in the Barry case noted in their filing. The
high court ruled that it could discourage the development of
additional law enforcement safeguards to apply the existing
regulations too rigidly.

   International pop stars gathered in
John Lennon's native city of Liverpool on Friday to rehearse the
Beatles songs they will perform at a memorial concert for the slain
star.
   Terence Trent D'Arby, Kylie Minogue and Wet Wet Wet will join
such '60s and '70s rockers as Joe Cocker and the Moody Blues in a
Saturday concert that will be televised in Britain.
   The program will be re-broadcast around the world in October as
part of a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon.
   The surviving former Beatles _ George Harrison, Paul McCartney
and Ringo Starr _ are not attending, but McCartney and Starr have
prepared filmed contributions.
   Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, said of the three surviving Beatles:
``They will be with us in spirit.''
   Lennon was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980, when
he was 40. The confessed killer, Mark Chapman, is serving a life
prison sentence.
   Concert proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, a charity
for environmental projects that Yoko Ono and Lennon founded. The
organizers said they hoped for a turnout of 45,000. Tickets are $41.

   A 7-year-old boy who faced amputation of his leg
because of a congenital defect will likely regain full use of the
limb following a complicated bone graft and leg-stretching process,
his surgeon said Friday.
   Josh Ellison, who underwent eight hours of surgery on Tuesday,
was recovering at The Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan
after the second half of the two-part process was completed, Dr.
Andrew Weiland said.
   ``He's a tough little kid. He's doing great, doing just fine,''
said Weiland, surgeon chief at the hospital. ``He should end up
with a fairly normal, functioning left leg.''
   Without the procedure, the boy unquestionably would have lost
his leg, Weiland said.
   ``He's amazing,'' the boy's mother, Kate Ellison, said from his
hospital room. ``It's already hard to keep him down. He wants to
get out and do whatever.''
   The Cabool, Mo., boy was born with congenital pseudarthrosis in
the left leg _ a localization of the disease which afflicted the
Elephant Man. The ailment caused his left tibia, or shin bone, to
bend rather than grow straight.
   When he was eight months old, he suffered a fractured leg
because of the illness and underwent several unsuccessful
operations in Missouri. His right leg was 3{ inches longer than his
left before this most recent treatment began in February.
   ``We were told they would have to amputate, but we didn't want
to hear it,'' said Mrs. Ellison. ``We tried to find someone who
could help Josh.''
   They were directed to Weiland, an expert in microvascular bone
grafting. In this procedure, a bone, the surrounding tissue and its
blood supply are transplanted to another part of the body, where
microsurgery reconnects all the blood vessels.
   Josh was brought to New York in February to begin the first
phase of treatment, the Ilazarov procedure to lengthen the leg.
Every day for two months, Mrs. Ellison turned three dials
surgically attached to her son's leg to stretch it out.
   The device lengthened his leg by one millimeter per day, and
when Josh arrived for the surgery on Tuesday the legs were almost
the same length, Weiland said. Doctors took a bone from his right
leg and implanted it where the diseased bone had been.
   If everything continues to work out, Mrs. Ellison will bring
Josh back to Missouri on Monday. He will spend the next three
months wearing a splint to support the transplanted bone, with
Weiland expecting to see the boy for a check-up this summer.

<HEAD>Mohawks Bury a Casualty of Reservation Gambling War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singing ``Give Peace a
Chance,'' Mohawks traveling in a cortege of bullet-pocked cars on
Friday buried an Indian killed in a factional battle over gambling
on their reservation.
   In other developments, one faction claimed to have deposed the
tribal government in the Canadian sector of the St. Regis Indian
Reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canadian border.
   A federal mediation effort was beefed up, and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo proposed creation of a internal police force for the
reservation, which is largely unhindered by outside authority. Many
Indians say the land is exempt from state and federal law.
   Factions on the reservation have been battling for weeks over
the future of casino gambling and bingo on the reservation. New
York state and Canadian police moved in Tuesday to restore order
after a clash that killed two Mohawks, one on each side of the
gambling dispute.
   The warring factions laid aside their differences Friday long
enough for the church funeral of gambling opponent Matthew Pyke,
22, who was shot dead in a crossfire Tuesday on the Canadian side
of the reservation.
   Reporters were given rare access to the reservation to watch
some 500 mourners walking in rows seven-to-10 wide, holding hands.
The cortege was led by 40 Mohawks wearing clan beads, embroidered
shirts and other traditional Indian dress.
   The procession began on the U.S. side of the reservation and
ended at St. Regis Catholic Church on the Canadian side. Mohawks
barred reporters from crossing the border to the church.
   A woman in the front row carried a framed picture of Pyke, while
mourners at the rear of the procession sang ``Give Peace a
Chance,'' the anti-war song by the late John Lennon.
   A procession of about a dozen cars followed, some bearing the
scars of the gambling violence. One was missing all its windows
except the windshield because the others had been shattered by
gunfire.
   ``We're putting aside our anger for the day,'' said Eddie Gray,
who walked in the procession. ``It's a day for mourning.''
   Four hours after Pyke was killed, the body of gambling supporter
Harold Edwards Jr., 32, was found near the same spot. No arrests
have been made in the killings.
   Members of the pro-gambling Warrior Society, a self-appointed
reservation security force, said they observed two hours of silence
in honor of Pyke, though he worked on the on opposing side in the
gambling dispute.
   ``It's our traditional belief that we have total respect for the
dead,'' said warriors supporter Minnie Garrow.
   Violence has flared occasionally on the 28,000-acre reservation
since last July, when the FBI and state police raided casinos on
Indian land.
   Mohawks who oppose gambling say the casinos breed crime.
Supporters say the gambling halls are an economic boon for the
reservation, where about 9,000 Mohawks live.
   In other developments Friday, Warriors said the 12-member Band
Council, which governs the Canadian side of the reservation, had
been voted out of office. An interim council was sworn in Thursday,
said Stanley Cohen, a lawyer for the Warriors.
   Some had criticized the council when its leader last week
ordered evacuation of 500 women, children and elderly because of
the violence. They accused him of trying to make the violence seem
worse than it was.
   Chief Mike Mitchell, who heads the Band Council, could not be
reached for comment Friday on whether the interim council had
superseded his own.
   The Canadian government still recognizes Mitchell's council,
said Ron Boivin, a spokesman for the Canadian Indian affairs
department.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo _ under fire from some Indians for sending in
state police _ said in Albany that he would press for creation of
an independent Mohawk police force on the reservation. Cuomo had
been urged by some Mohawk factions and the Canadian government to
intercede.
   In Washington, the Justice Department announced it had
dispatched a specially assembled mediation team. The team was
expected to arrive Saturday to buttress the efforts of one federal
mediator already there, said Grace Flores Hughes, director of the
department's Community Relations Service.

<HEAD>Breeden: Milken Testimony Before Congress Could Complicate Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional testimony by convicted junk bond
dealer Michael Milken before he is sentenced could complicate the
government's massive securities fraud investigation, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden said Friday.
   The House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations
subcommittee voted Tuesday to subpoena Milken, who pleaded guilty
last month to six felonies and agreed to pay $600 million.
   If Milken receives immunity from the panel, nothing he says at a
congressional hearing could be used against him in state or federal
courts.
   ``I think we'll try to work with Congress to make sure they
understand the status of the case as they consider what hearings
they wish to have and when they want to have them,'' Breeden told
reporters during an informal session in his office.
   ``If you had immunized testimony before ... the plea agreement
and the settlement becomes irrevocable on the date of sentencing,
then it does create potential for introducing complications into
the case,'' said Breeden.
   The subpoena must be approved by the full House committee before
Milken is called to testify before Congress, something he refused
to do two years ago.
   Milken, once head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. department
that dealt in high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, faces up to 28
years in prison when he is sentenced in New York on Oct. 1.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the committee and
subcomittee, said in a statement issued through his office:
   ``We're aware of the concerns of the SEC and others and will
work closely with them to avoid major complications. However, the
subcommittee intends to continue to perform its duties and
oversight with vigor.''
   On other topics, Breeden said it was ``premature at this point''
to say what impact a recent appeals court decision in New York
overturning the insider trading conviction of ex-stockbroker Robert
Chestman would have on SEC enforcement efforts.
   He said the SEC was studying the decision to determine whether
to appeal it and what implications it has for pending cases and
settlements already reached.
   ``We're certainly not going to get into renegotiating
settlements at a preliminary stage,'' said Breeden.
   In settling civil and criminal charges with the SEC and the
Justice Department, Milken agreed to testify truthfully before
grand juries and at trials or court proceedings stemming from ``any
Drexel-related activities.''
   If Milken fails to comply with those rules he can be prosecuted
for perjury and obstruction of justice and jailed for contempt of
court. The agreements do not mention congressional testimony.

   Strong thunderstorms developed east of the Mississippi River on
Friday and extended from Illinois through Mississippi to coastal
Texas, but the sun shone throughout much of the West.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell from the Ohio Valley to
Virginia and North Carolina.
   Late Friday morning, a thunderstorm in north-central Kentucky
produced hail an inch in diameter at Harned.
   Light rain and drizzle extended from Iowa and northern Missouri
to northern Ohio and lower Michigan. A few light showers also
developed ahead of an upper level weather disturbance crossing the
northern Plains.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with
sunshine abundant in the western half of the country.
   Strong, gusty north winds blew from the southern Plains to the
middle Mississippi Valley Friday afternoon, and blustery north
winds ushered cool air into the nation's midsection.
   Temperatures rose into the 70s and 80s in the Southeast, while
readings were only in the 50s from the southern and central Plains
to the upper Great Lakes region. Temperatures were in the 40s from
eastern Iowa to southern Lower Michigan and northwestern Ohio.
   Seasonable temperatures warmed the West: 80s and lower 90s
across parts of Southern California and southern Arizona.
   The nation's low Friday morning was 24 degrees at Trinidad,
Colo., where 4 new inches of snow fell.
   Pueblo, Colo., received 9.4 inches of snow from the most recent
storm, pushing the total snowfall for the winter season to 69.6
inches and surpassing the 1947-48 record of 65.8 inches.
   The snowfall total at Pueblo for the first three days of May was
10.6 inches, beating the previous record of 10.2 inches for May,
set in 1917.

   A pilot's relatives sought $3 million in a
wrongful-death lawsuit filed Friday in the crash of a plane once
rumored to be linked to covert shipments to Central America.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court alleges air traffic
controllers in Houston misdirected pilot George Reti away from an
airstrip as the DC-6A plane ran low on fuel on a flight from El
Salvador.
   The July 20, 1988, crash in a Louisiana bayou killed Reti and
two crew members.
   Some speculated at the time that the flight could have been
involved in supplying Contra rebels in Nicaragua. No connection
ever has been established, said attorney John Eversole, who
represents ex-wife Regina Reti and her daughter.
   ``Maybe we'll eventually learn the truth about this flight,''
Eversole said. ``It seems the full story about this incident has
never come out.''
   The flight, which originated in Miami, left San Salvador and was
scheduled to stop in New Orleans before returning to Miami. The
plane was operated by TACA International Airlines, the Salvadoran
national airline, and registered to Miami-based Universal Air
Equipment Leasing Inc., the suit said.
   Speculation was prompted by the route, and fed by both
companies' refusal to reveal details of the flight.
   Found amid the wreckage in the Mississippi delta was about
$650,000 worth of electronic components, women's lingerie and iced
fish, said Eversole.
   The crew reported to Houston air traffic controllers that the
plane was running low on fuel and would be unable to reach New
Orleans International Airport, according to Federal Aviation
Administration records.
   The flight was directed to Leeville, La., about 50 miles south
of New Orleans, and told there was a 3,000-foot runway for an
emergency landing. But the airstrip actually was in Leesville, La.,
about 160 miles away near the Texas border.
   ``It's clear they said, `Leeville.' It was a mistake that cost
the lives of three people,'' said Eversole.
   Killed along with Reti, 39, was his co-pilot, Keith LaFever, and
flight engineer, Steven Herreros. There were no passengers.
   The suit names the U.S. government as defendant, claiming
employees of the FAA were negligent and failed to follow proper
procedures.
   A $3 million claim filed with the FAA by Mrs. Reti was rejected
last year.

   Israel's military command denied Friday that
one of its navy boats opened fire on the yacht of Jordan's King
Hussein in the Gulf of Aqaba.
   The military, however, admitted shots were fired while the
monarch's craft was in the vicinity but said the shots were aimed
in another direction and were part of a routine weapons check.
   An Israeli newspaper had reported an Israeli patrol boat opened
fire on Hussein's yacht on Saturday as it sailed in international
waters, accompanied by a Jordanian navy vessel, with the monarch on
deck.
   The liberal daily Haaretz, citing sources, said the incident
occurred in the Gulf of Aqaba, and resulted in no damage or
injuries.
   The newspaper said Jordan had protested sharply to Israel and
the United States, and that Israeli officials refused to apologize
but assured Jordan it would not happen again.
   President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
expressed anger when informed about the incident, the newspaper
said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.S. ambassador to Israel, William Brown, had expressed deep
concern to the Israeli government over the matter. Brown was told
the Israelis have taken steps to avoid such another such incident,
the spokesman said.
   Palace officials in Jordan declined to comment, and spokesman
for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the defense ministry could
not be reached for comment.
   The newspaper account said after the first shots were fired, the
king took over command of the yacht, ordering the vessel to turn
and head for Saudi Arabian waters.
   The Israeli vessel accelerated and continued to fire as it
``tailgated'' the king's yacht, the report continued, halting and
holding fire only when it reached Saudi waters.
   The king has a residence in the Red Sea port town of Aqaba,
which abuts the Israeli resort town of Eilat and is near the Saudi
border.
   The newspaper said neither the king's bodyguards nor the
Jordanian navy vessel accompanying the yacht returned fire. The
sources quoted by Haaretz also said the Israeli fire came from
weapons mounted on the deck, ``not just shots from a pistol.''
   The Israeli military command's account differed sharply from the
newspaper's version of events.
   The military comment said in a statement Friday that ``no shots
were fired by the Israeli navy at King Hussein's yacht and no chase
was conducted.''
   But it said its naval vessel did fire some shots toward empty
waters in what it described as a check of its guns. It also said
the Israeli craft was in Israeli waters.
   ``Israel naval units have long standing and clear orders
regarding rules of conduct during the passage of King Hussein's
yacht ... and in the incident noted, the Israel naval vessel acted
in accordance with these instructions,'' the statement said.
   A military spokesman, who could not be named in accordance with
regulations, said Hussein's yacht was to the east of the Israeli
boat. The military statement said the Israeli shots were fired
south.
   ``I speculate that they (the Jordanians) probably thought the
gunfire was directed at them,'' the spokesman said.
   The spokesman said Hussein's yacht was easily recognizable, and
that sailors almost certainly knew it was the monarch's.
   Israel television reported the naval vessel apparently
approached the yacht and that the Jordanians probably interpreted
this as a chase.

<HEAD>Cracks Appear in East German Government Over Unification</HEAD>

   Dissension broke out in East Germany's first
democratic government on Friday over the costs of unification with
West Germany.
   The fragile coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere appeared threatened as the left-leaning Social Democrats
attacked what they said was the government's willingness to agree
to West Germany's terms for unity.
   Experts from both countries met in East Berlin on Friday for
ongoing talks on shifting East Germany away from a socialist
economy as quickly as possible.
   Although the Social Democrats agreed to join the government of
de Maiziere, who leads the conservative Christian Democrats, they
complained Friday that the terms of the economic union would create
hardships for East Germans.
   The Social Democrats hold important cabinet posts in de
Maiziere's government but have begun distancing themselves from the
agreements between the Germanys on merging their economies.
   ``In the East Berlin Cabinet stands a crack in the house,
because we up to now cannot be held responsible for the outcome of
the (unification) state treaty,'' said Richard Schroeder, head of
the Social Democrat faction in Parliament.
   ``I am worried about a break in the axle on the way to unity,''
he said.
   Social Minister Regine Hildebrandt, a Social Democrat,
criticized the decision between the governments to tailor East
Germany's pension program to West Germany's. She said it would
reduce benefits for East Germans.
   The economies and social institutions of the two nations are to
merge on July 2 as a prelude to full unification next year.
   But Social Democrats have become increasingly critical of what
they say is a willingness to accept Bonn's terms and the lack of
guarantees to protect East Germans who will give up enormous social
subsidies.
   De Maiziere, whose party finished first in the March 18
elections, formed a coalition with the Social Democrats to have the
two-third Parliament majority needed to make constitutional changes
that would make unification possible.
   West Germany says a quick move to a free market will create jobs
and raise living standards and eventually eliminate the economic
hardships that are expected in the early stages of unification.
   The dissent in East Germany came as the superpowers, France,
Britain and the two Germany states prepared for talks in Bonn on
Saturday on the role of a united Germany in the military alliances.
   Although the Christian Democrats, who finished first in the
March 18 national elections, and the Social Democrats, who finished
second, are part of the same government, many of their candidates
are facing each other in Sunday's local elections.
   The two governments agreed on the general terms of an economic
union on Wednesday. It would exchange salaries, wages and small
savings accounts of East Germans for an equal amount of West German
marks.
   Social Democrats are critical of a provision to keep the debts
of East German factories, many of which are expected to fail. They
are demanding that the debts be forgiven.
   Mrs. Hildebrandt also criticized the pension plan agreement that
she said would reduce benefits to a third of the 2.9 million
elderly and handicapped participants.
   Wolfgang Tierse, deputy chief of the Social Democrats faction,
said his party would not endorse the economic and social treaty
that is being negotiated as a basis for unification. He said it
would bring ``massive poverty.''

<TEXT>
   Freed American hostage Frank
Reed returned to his homeland Friday with a prayer that ``my mates
left behind'' will quickly share his freedom and joy. ``God,'' he
implored, ``make it soon.''
   Drawn and unsteady despite several days' rest at a U.S. military
hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, Reed was embraced by his
family and another former hostage, Robert Polhill, who was released
by separate captors in Lebanon just eight days before Reed was let
go Monday.
   Reed, freed after 42 months, whispered in Polhill's ear: ``We're
going to get the rest of them out, aren't we?''
   In a brief formal statement that left his greeters shedding
tears as a gentle rain fell, Reed said: ``Fellow Americans, because
of all of you I'm alive.''
   And in a special tribute to all hostage relatives, several of
whom were on hand in a customary show of unity, he declared
``Because of Peggy Say, Kit and Joan Sutherland, the Keenan
sisters, Pat McCarthy, and many, many others, I am unchained and
unblindfolded.''
   Moments after he boarded a bus which was to take himself and his
family to the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at the base, the caravan
was diverted down the tarmac where, to Reed's delight, he was
greeted by Barbara Bush as she was about to board a flight to
Kentucky.
   ``We're so glad you're home,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I know the
president wishes he was here to meet you.'' Bush was in Oklahoma
giving a speech on NATO and the future of Europe.
   The release of Reed and Polhill left six Americans and nine
other Westerners still held in Lebanon.
   Of those, Reed, 57, has said he shared moments in captivity with
Terry Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East
correspondent who was kidnapped in March of 1985 and is the longest
held hostage, as well as Thomas Sutherland, an American University
of Beirut official, and Britons Brian Keenan and John McCarthy.
   Ms. Say, Anderson's sister, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, where Reed's family resides in Malden, were among
non-family members to greet the former hostage as he stepped from
the small Air Force jetliner. Two daughters by a previous marriage,
Marilyn Langston and Jacqueline Reed, were the first to board the
plane for a private reunion moments earlier.
   Reed told the airport gathering, ``Because Tom, Terry, John and
Brian refused to give up, I am with you today.''
   Reed was accompanied on the flight from Germany by his wife
Fahima, known as Fifi, and their young son Tarek, who played on the
tarmac with a live, lobster that Kennedy presented. In Germany,
Reed had remarked that the first thing he wanted when he got home
was a 3-pound lobster.
   ``Of course, I want every hostage released,'' he said. ``Let the
world not forget that what me and my mates ... represent is
something that transcends all geopolitical ideas and motives.''
That something, he added, is the right to ``freedom and life.''
   ``I ask all of you today, tonight and tomorrow to send personal
messages to every political leader involved in this terrible
tragedy, asking for its end.
   ``I thank you for your love and concern and yes, for your tears.
For I cry with you that this tragic affair will end soon. God, make
it soon. That good men like my mates left behind never, never,
never again have to go through what I have been through and what
others are still going through. Amen, amen, amen.''
   ``And finally,'' he added, ``let the people of Ireland and
England never forget Brian or John. For God's sake, they are you
and you are they. You can't let them down.''
   Reed, while still in West Germany, had said Britain should be
doing more to free its own citizens in Lebanon.
   He offered no such criticism of his own government. Reed likely
will visit President Bush within days, as has Polhill already.
   Kennedy, who spent a few moments alone with Reed aboard the
twin-engine executive jet, said ``I thought he was in superb
spirits.
   ``I admire his personal courage,'' said Kennedy, adding ``We're
hopeful and optimistic that we're in a new time and a new era'' in
which all hostages will soon be freed.
   During his captivity, Reed's Islamic captors falsely told him
that his aging mother, Leota Sprague, had died, daughter Marilyn
told reporters.
   Friday, Reed said ``to every member of my family, and a very
special 91-year-old beautiful mother of mine, who by example
demonstrated to the world that we Reeds are not quitters, I love
and thank you for your prayers.''
   Reed lost 60 pounds in captivity during which he was kept
blindfolded and bound, but is otherwise in basically sound health,
doctors have said.

<BYLINE>Observers Predict $34 Million Judgment Against Inquirer Won't Stand
^By MIKE OWEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $34 million libel judgment against The
Philadelphia Inquirer raises serious constitutional questions and
will likely be overturned on appeal, a media lawyer and a
reporter's group said Friday.
   A Common Pleas Court jury on Thursday awarded $2.5 million in
compensatory damages and $31.5 million in punitive damages to
former first assistant district attorney Richard Sprague. He sued
the paper over stories published 17 years ago that questioned his
actions as a prosecutor.
   ``It's unimaginable to me that a punitive damage award in this
amount could or would be upheld,'' said Floyd Abrams, a prominent
First Amendment lawyer. He represents NBC in appealing a $5.3
million libel judgment won by entertainer Wayne Newton.
   ``This is another example of libel law running amok,'' Abrams
said. ``I think that this case and others will sooner rather than
later lead the Supreme Court to address the constitutionality of
punitive damages in libel cases.''
   Henry Kaufman, general counsel of the Libel Defense Resource
Center, a media-sponsored clearinghouse in New York, said the
judgment was the largest ever against the news media. He said only
two libel judgments of more than $1 million have been affirmed on
appeal.
   Sprague, now a successful attorney in private practice, won for
the second time before a jury in the case. The Inquirer had earlier
successfully appealed a $4.5 million verdict _ less than
one-seventh the amount of Thursday's award, which Sprague said gave
meaning to the idea of punitive damages.
   ``I intend to fight to maintain it,'' Sprague said Friday. ``The
whole theory of punitive damages is that it should not just be a
little slap on the wrist. It's got to be meaningful.''
   A tendency for juries to grant ever-higher punitive damages has
come under scrutiny in other areas recently.
   Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to decide in an Alabama
insurance fraud case whether punitive damage awards can be so great
as to become unconstitutional.
   The court last year ruled large awards in civil suits do not
violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines, but the court
did not address the question of whether such awards violate due
process protections.
   ``Punitive damages in general are dangerous,'' Abrams said. ``In
libel cases, they are perilous. Juries are given no standards, no
limits, no bounds. And sometimes they act that way.''
   In the Philadelphia case, jurors were given only the newspaper's
net worth, $102 million, in determining how to set the punitive
damages. The newspaper was not allowed to cite Sprague's income,
which Forbes magazine estimated at $1.6 million in 1988.
   Common Pleas Court Judge Charles P. Mirarchi Jr. said the jury
had to find outrageous conduct, and that it could set an award to
punish the Inquirer and to send a message to the rest of the news
media.
   ``My basic opinion is that the law is fair and the jury must
make that determination, not the judge,'' Mirarchi said.
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, sees a First Amendment issue in such awards.
   ``All a punitive damage award is when it's awarded against a
news organization is a fine for speaking,'' she said. ``But beyond
that ... it doesn't have to bear any relationship to anything.''
   Reed Irvine, chairman of Accuracy in Media, a conservative
watchdog group, believes punitive damages do have a place in libel
cases. But he also sees problems with the judgment against the
Inquirer.
   ``The amounts involved here are almost ruinous in a sense,''
Irvine said. ``I think that's going too far myself. It's legitimate
to give 'em a good hard rap across the knuckles, but it's another
to take it out of their hide.''
   The group's director of media analysis, former Philadelphia
Inquirer staffer Joseph Goulden, said such awards are ``saying what
the public's saying about the press. The only way to enforce a code
of ethics is in the courtroom.''
   Abrams said he was worried about the impact on news gathering:
``Punitive damages have the potential for so chilling speech that
the public would lose a significant amount of the most important
news that reporters present.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III ran into a
stone wall Friday when he tried to persuade the Soviet Union to
withdraw its objections to NATO membership for a united Germany.
   ``I can't say we heard anything different than we heard
before,'' a senior U.S. official said after Baker met for 3{ hours
with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Baker's hotel room
overlooking the Rhine River.
   The official, who briefed reporters under rules guaranteeing him
anonymity, said the two sides also made no dent in issues blocking
treaties to reduce their long-range nuclear missiles and to lower
troop and tank levels in Europe.
   Baker and Shevardnadze will meet in Moscow May 16-19 to try to
close the gap on weapons cutbacks. But with the Washington summit
less than a month away, prospects appear to be diminishing for
presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev initialing a landmark arms
control accord.
   Friday's meeting produced one tentative agreement _ a joint
effort to assist the hungry in Ethiopia.
   The official said the idea is to fly American food to Ethiopia
aboard Soviet planes.
   But on Germany and on arms control, the results were slim.
   Baker also brought up the issue of Lithuania, where an
independence movement is being stifled by a Kremlin economic
blockade.
   ``It's fine to talk about a need for dialogue, but one actually
has to take steps to get to a dialogue,'' the senior official said
of Soviet inability to reach a formula for talks with Lithuanian
leaders.
   Baker and Shevardnadze were in Bonn for the ``two-plus-four''
German unification talks that open Saturday. The foreign ministers
from Britain, France and the two German states also will take part.
   Baker meanwhile released a text of a statement he made to
foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at a
closed session in Brussels.
   In it, Baker said, ``The reform process in the Soviet Union will
be called into question if self-determination in Lithuania is
denied.''
   He said the Bush administration did not wish to take any action
that could escalate the situation.
   But he hinted U.S. patience is running out _ and that critics of
the administration's soft approach could win out.
   ``We understand the pressures affecting the Soviet leadership,''
Baker said. ``They, too, must understand that we have our own
principles and are subject to our own political pressure.''
   At the start of Friday's talks, Shevardnadze told reporters,
``We consider a unified Germany as an important factor of stability
and peace in Europe.''
   But he added: ``For such a giant to belong to one bloc, one
alliance, will not create conditions of stability.''
   Shevardnadze seemed to want U.S. troops to remain in Germany,
however, and offered no alternative to NATO membership, the senior
official said. ``I think the Soviets are still wrestling with the
problem,'' he added.
   Shevardnadze called his talks with Baker on arms control issues
a ``very constructive and useful conversation.'' But he said they
had not settled any of their differences over restricting
long-range nuclear missiles.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany held separate talks with
Shevardnadze and Baker on Friday. Kohl spokesman Hans Klein said
Kohl offered Shevardnadze a significant expansion of bilateral
ties, particularly economic cooperation.
   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said
Thursday's U.S. decision to scrap deployment of new short-range
nuclear weapons ``will be of enormous importance because the
question of disarmament is very much linked with the develoment in
Europe and also the German-German question.''
   He said NATO and the Warsaw Pact were increasingly becoming
political organizations rather than military alliances.
   Baker has said Germany's membership in NATO is not a decision
for the Soviets to make, that it is up to the 16 Western allies.
   But he hopes to persuade Shevardnadze the powerful nation to
emerge from the union of West Germany and East Germany will not
menace neighbors that lost millions of people at the hands of the
Nazis in World War II.
   Baker also hopes to overcome the slump in negotiations in Vienna
to conclude a treaty to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, a former West German
defense minister, said Thursday in Brussels the allies agreed a
united Germany would have no nuclear or chemical weapons in its
military arsenal. He also suggested Soviet troops might be
stationed temporarily in what is now East Germany.
   Shevardnadze suggested last week that a united Germany should
belong to NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Vitaly Churkin, a Soviet Foreign ministry spokesman, told
reporters Friday, ``It's very hard to see how Germany loses in that
kind of situation.''
   The U.S. announcement that it will not deploy any new
short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany set a positive tone
for the talks in Bonn.
   America also will not modernize nuclear artillery shells stored
in Europe, and Baker offered to negotiate a reduction in the 88
Lance launchers that target East Germany with 700 nuclear missiles
and 900 conventional rockets.
   Shevardnadze called the U.S. move a ``good decision.''

   A federal judge Friday ordered prosecutors to come
up with a list of $20 million in assets seized from Manuel Noriega,
saying some of the money must have come from the deposed Panamanian
ruler's legitimate activities.
   During an hour-long hearing prompted by defense attorneys'
request to withdraw from the case, lead defense lawyer Frank Rubino
claimed that U.S. intelligence agencies paid $11 million to
Noriega, with another $6 million coming from foreign governments.
   ``I don't know if you can call money from the CIA tainted or
not, but it's certainly not drug money,'' said Rubino.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said while Noriega
clearly could not use ``ill-gotten gains'' to pay his attorneys,
the government could not arbitrarily seize money without proving he
had earned it through drug trafficking or other illegal means.
   Defense attorneys have demanded the frozen accounts be released,
saying they can no longer afford to represent Noriega in the
complex and expensive case without being paid.
   But the government insists Rubino may have been paid $1 million
or more and says it is under no obligation to turn over
drug-tainted funds to the jailed suspect.
   The judge observed that Noriega had been a military officer for
more than 20 years and said he must have acquired some money
legitimately.
   ``It is all the more important, of course, because of who is
being prosecuted,'' the judge said. ``And we have got to recognize
that our justice system is on display.''
   Hoeveler tentatively set a hearing for Friday for the government
and the defense to discuss the confiscated assets.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said the government did
not object to such a list. But he said all the accounts, except
one, were in foreign banks.
   ``Foreign governments will have some interest (in the money) and
their laws will prevail over those assets,'' Sullivan said.
   Defense attorneys for two weeks tried unsuccessfully to
negotiate with the U.S. attorney's office to release money before
deciding Monday to file a motion to withdraw from the case.
   Rubino said the government already has spent $12 million and was
prepared to spend $25 million more prosecuting his client. The
attorney said the defense has the right to use Noriega's funds to
hire more attorneys, investigators and secretaries.
   But Sullivan responded with an affidavit from another prosecutor
who said Rubino told her he had received a retainer of ``seven
figures'' from Noriega. Rubino has acknowledged the comment but
said it was a joke.
   Along with the motion to withdraw, the defense has asked the
judge to order the funds released because the government has failed
to show, as required by law, that the money was illegally earned.
   ``We believe that at least $17 million frozen was derived from
legitimate sources,'' said a defense motion filed Thursday. ``We
will disclose the source of $11 million as directed by this court.''
   The remaining $6 million is covered by federal classified
information restrictions, limiting public disclosure, the motion
said.
   Rubino noted at the hearing that $5.8 million confiscated by
U.S. troops in Noriega's quarters in Panama had been handed back to
the Panamanian government by the United States without informing
the defense. He said the government had never established whether
that money had been acquired illegally.
   In pleading the defense case, Rubino said attorneys learned
``the intelligence community is in possession of evidence that
completely exonerates General Noriega as to a particular count of
the indictment,'' but said the defense lacks the money to pursue
the lead.
   The prosecution says the money at issue is held in 27 bank
accounts, apparently including some in the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, which was at the center of a
money-laundering conspiracy recently tried in Tampa.
   ``Only one of these accounts, located in Panama, is in the
defendant's name,'' the government motion said, adding
investigators are not even sure if it contains any money.
   Noriega was indicted here in February 1988 on charges of taking
money from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to make Panama a safe
haven for cocaine smuggling. Noriega surrendered to U.S.
authorities on Jan. 4, two weeks after U.S. troops invaded Panama.
   He is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami.

   A slight wobble detected in the Hubble Space
Telescope has disappeared, engineers said Friday.
   ``We are not seeing anything of that right now,'' said Mike
Harrington, who is directing the months-long checkout of the
telescope. ``We are not sure exactly what we saw or what it was.''
   Harrington had good news to report: Ground controllers received
their first data from the telescope's science computer after
sending commands.
   When the telescope is up and running, it will be that computer
that sends the sophisticated science data.
   The slight jitter showed up Thursday, a motion of just 1-600th
of a degree _ too much in an instrument that's supposed to be able
to measure the width of a human hair at a range of five miles.
   Asked what caused it, Harrington said: ``Nobody really knows, it
could be as simple as the fact that we weren't calibrated quite
right as we started and that we overexcited the controls.''
   Harrington, an engineer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Alabama, said the telescope's pointing control system would be
turned on Sunday morning and the jitter, if it's still there, will
show up then.
   The series of problems experienced by the telescope since
astronauts left it in space April 25 have put the checkout at least
a week behind schedule, Harrington said.
   ``It's perfectly expectable,'' he said. ``This probably is the
most complex spacecraft we've ever flown. You know you are going to
have these kinds of things, unexpected and unpredicted little
quirks of the spacecraft. You've got to take your time to figure
them out and move on.''
   The telescope's electronics have gone into a protective mode
three times because of small glitches. The telescope's lens cover
twice introduced too much motion and a primary antenna brushed up
against a cable and could move no further.
   The first picture had been expected from the telescope by
mid-week, but it's now expected no earlier than Tuesday.

<HEAD>Prosecution Memo Alleges Mexico City Police Chief Attended Kidnap
Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico City's police chief attended a meeting
at which the kidnapping of murdered U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena was plotted, a government document says.
   Javier Garcia Paniagua, Mexico's secretary of state from 1976 to
1982 and a former president of its ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, has not been charged in the case.
   But according to a prosecution memorandum filed in federal court
this week in preparation for next week's trial of four people
indicted in Camarena's slaying, he was among 10 people who met in
Guadalajara, Mexico, to plan the abduction.
   Mexican officials expressed surprise at the allegation.
   ``I have not heard the name of Garcia Paniagua in this case,''
Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, Mexico's consul general in Los Angeles,
said Thursday. ``I don't know where they got this information. I am
going to send this to Mexico.''
   Camarena was abducted in Guadalajara in February 1985 and taken
to a house owned by convicted drug trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero
where he was interrogated and tortured.
   His mutilated body and that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar,
were found March 5, 1985, at a ranch 65 miles southeast of
Guadalajara.
   The four who face trial in connection with his killing are
Mexican businessman Ruben Zuno Arce; reputed Honduran drug kingpin
Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros; Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former
Mexican homicide officer; and Javier Vasquez Velasco, who is
accused of killing two U.S. tourists.
   The documents, filed by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Manuel Medrano
and John Carlton, say several high-ranking Mexican officials,
including Garcia, joined reputed drug traffickers to plot the
abduction of Camarena, an undercover agent for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   ``Corruption amongst Mexican high-ranking government and law
enforcement officials was pervasive,'' a document said. ``Law
enforcement officials were on the traffickers' payroll, and
facilitated matters by providing protection for marijuana and
cocaine loads, and escorting marijuana shipments being transported
and smuggled into the United States.''
   The documents did not cite any sources.
   The memo alleges four meetings were held to discuss what to do
with Camarena, and that Garcia attended the second one.
   The meeting Garcia allegedly attended was at the home of Javier
Barba Hernandez. Barba, a reputed chief lieutenant of the
Guadalajara narcotics cartel, was killed last year in a shootout
with Mexican federal police.
   Others who allegedly attended the meeting included Zuno Arce;
Matta Ballesteros; Caro Quintero; Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former
director of the Mexican federal security police; Armando Pavon
Reyes, Ibarra Herrera's chief aide; Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a former
director of Interpol in Mexico; reputed Mexican drug baron Ernesto
Fonseca Carrillo; and reputed drug trafficker Manuel Salcido.
   All but Salcido, who remains a fugitive, and Garcia have been
indicted in the case.

   Detectives searched Friday for more than $1
million worth of stolen artworks, including Egyptian and Roman
antiquities, still missing despite the arrest of three suspects in
the robbery of a gallery.
   Four ski-masked bandits shattered the thick plate glass window
of the Nahan Galleries in Manhattan's Soho district early Thursday,
said Sgt. Dominic Rippillino of the Safe, Loft and Truck Squad,
which investigates art theft.
   They got away with as many as 40 pieces, including ancient
Egyptian vases and religious figures, and Roman glass treasures
from the second and third centuries B.C. Three etchings by Max
Papart, a 79-year-old contemporary of Pablo Picasso, were also
taken in their frames, police said.
   ``They survived 3,000 years, but they didn't survive New York,
that's the worst part of it,'' said Sherri Nahan, one of the owners
of the private gallery, which offers works for sale. She valued the
works at more than $1 million.
   Mrs. Nahan worried that the fragile antiquities, which measured
as small as 3 inches to as large as 12 inches, might have been
irreparably damaged.
   ``Putting them in a box and subjecting them to a 90-mile-an-hour
car chase, it's as bad as I can think of handling them,'' she said.
   A team of detectives on a stakeout nearby heard a report of the
robbery and chased the burglars through Manhattan and into the
borough of Brooklyn at speeds up to 90 mph, but lost the thieves.
Discovery of one of the stolen cars used in the burglary led to
three arrests, but a fourth suspect and the art weren't found.
   Arrested were Robin Tellier, 29, Ronald Rescigno, 29, and
Timothy Burns, 23, all of Queens.
   The three suspects were believed to be part of a gang
responsible for several burglaries of fur and jewelry stores in
Manhattan, Queens and on Long Island over the last three years,
said Sgt. Dominic Rippillino of the Safe, Loft and Truck Squad,
which investigates art theft.
   ``We're hoping that the art does surface, that we're able to
track it down,'' he said.
   Mrs. Nahan said police theorized that the bandits were
instructed on what pieces to steal. ``They came with boxes, they
came prepared to take small pieces,'' she said.
   The three suspects were scheduled to be arraigned in Queens
Criminal Court on charges of grand larceny, burglary, car theft,
and conspiracy, said Dick Piperno, a spokesman for the Queens
District Attorney. Tellier was also charged with criminal use of a
firearm and criminal possession of a weapon.

<TEXT>
   A once-powerful municipal union boss was
convicted Friday of embezzlement, racketeering and conspiracy for
stealing more than $750,000 from the union treasury.
   A federal jury convicted Earl Stout and two co-defendants,
including Stout's son, William. A fourth defendant, Frances Rooney,
was acquitted.
   The 67-year-old Stout was ousted in 1988 after 14 years in
control of District Council 33 of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees. The union has 13,000 members, most
of them trash collectors, who work for the city of Philadelphia.
   ``I still say I'm innocent, but that doesn't make any difference
does it?'' said Earl Stout. ``But worst things than this can
happen. That's the way it goes when you've been at the top.''
   Prosecutor Seth Weber accused Stout of abusing his power even
while he won benefits for his members.
   ``While his people were repairing streets and collecting trash
he was picking their pockets,'' Weber said. ``Earl Stout believed
he was so good for the union, and had done so much, that he
believed he could take some of the money he was entrusted to
protect.''
   The elder Stout was convicted of conspiracy, racketeering, 32
counts of mail fraud and six counts of embezzlement involving a
total of $750,000.
   His son was convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud and eight counts
of theft.
   Cynthia Bullock, former director of the union's Legal Defense
Plan, was convicted of 11 counts of mail fraud.
   Ms. Rooney, former union vice president, was acquitted on both
counts against her, conspiracy and theft.
   Among the allegations against Stout were that he gave no-show
jobs at a union-owned John F. Kennedy hospital, which is headed by
his son. He also was accused of hiring consultants without
permission from the union's governing boards, converting the
beneficiary on two life insurance policies on himself from the
hospital to his family, and using hospital employees to work on
properties owned by his family or his friends.

   Firefighters backed up against the last natural
barrier between a 4-mile wall of flames and a wildlife preserve
said Friday they had controlled the fire, which has blackened
25,000 acres of the drought-crisp Everglades.
   Fire had raced across the dry grasslands and leaped a canal but
was beaten back before reaching a levee, the last natural barrier
between the flames and the sprawling Big Cypress National Wildlife
Preserve, officials said.
   Shortly after 5 p.m. EDT, the fire was reported under control,
said Peter Karayeanes, duty officer for the state Division of
Forestry. The area would be monitored in case of flare-ups, he said.
   A heavy downpour around noon Friday missed the center of the
fire but helped firefighters trying to control the last area of
violent burning.
   ``With that rain it slowed it down a little bit, brought the
humidity up so right now we have a whole lot of helicopters out
here,'' said John Kern, of the state Division of Forestry. ``We're
going to try to put it out with water.''
   Although arson has not been ruled out, investigators believe the
fire was sparked accidentally in an area frequented by people on
motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles, said senior state forester
Gene Dempsey.
   Despite the size of the scorched area about 25 miles west of
downtown Miami, wildlife officials say the fire has had little
effect on animals because the severe drought had already forced
most of them to water.
   ``We have a few snakes and rodents scurrying away, but that's
about it,'' Dempsey said.
   David Maehr, a biologist with the state Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission, said 17 panthers wearing the agency's
radio-tracking collars were checked during a routine helicopter
flight Friday and were ``nowhere near any danger from fire.''
   ``That is panther habitat,'' he said. ``But the thing about the
Everglades themselves is it's not as regularly used as more
forested landscapes, so we don't have the number of cats using the
Everglades, nor do we have the regularity of use.''
   Only about 30 to 50 panthers are believed to live in the wilds
of south Florida.
   No injuries have been reported from the fire, and no inhabited
areas were threatened by the blaze, one of three west of Miami.
   Another fire in Everglades National Park about 25 miles
southwest of the city scorched 10,500 acres by Friday, but
firefighters were confident they could control it by Saturday, said
park spokeswoman Darlene Koontz.
   Seminole Indian firefighters spent Thursday battling a smaller
blaze on their reservation in Broward County near the Collier
County line. The fire was contained after burning 800 acres.
   Fires are a part of the Everglades ecology, said park
spokeswoman Pat Tolle. But this year's blazes worry
environmentalists because the region's 20-month drought has left
some normally damp grasslands so dry that they are threatened.

   Iran's foreign minister said Friday
that his country will not work to free more Western hostages in
Lebanon until Israel releases hundreds of imprisoned Lebanese.
   Meanwhile, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah on Friday said it held
the U.S. government responsible for hindering the release of the
remaining Western hostages. Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed
to be an umbrella group for the hostage-holding factions.
   ``The U.S. administration bears the responsibility for any
complications in this issue,'' said a statement issued in Beirut
Friday by Hezbollah's press office. It said ``the ball is now in
America's court.''
   The Iranian foreign minister, ending a two-day official visit to
Finland, said Israel must free ``several hundred Lebanese
hostages'' before any steps are taken to free any of the 16
remaining hostages.
   The minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, demanded that the United
States and Britain put pressure on the Israelis and make goodwill
gestures to reciprocate for the recent release of two American
hostages.
   Frank Reed was released Monday after 42 months in captivity, and
arrived in the United States on Friday. Robert Polhill was released
April 22 after being held 39 months.
   ``The other side has to take practical steps ... to influence
Israel and the Phalangists,'' Velayati said, referring to a
Christian Lebanese group once allied with Israel.
   ``Especially the United States and Britain can persuade Israel
to release these abducted people,'' the Iranian official said at a
news conference.
   Velayati said the hostages are not in ``the hands of the
Iranians'' and that Iran had to persuade the Lebanese groups to
release Polhill and Reed.
   ``Of course, we played a key role, but we worked over months,''
he added.
   Velayati said ``no deals had been done'' for the release of the
two Americans and said that Iran had not been involved in any talks
with the United States.
   Among the remaining hostages in Lebanon are six Americans. The
longest held is Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson,
abducted March 16, 1985.
   The Hezbollah statement also urged the Bush administration to
help bring about the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jails, as well as tracing three Iranian officials and
their driver who disappeared in Lebanon's Christian heartland in
1982. The four are widely believed killed.
   Hussein Musawi, who heads a pro-Syrian wing in Hezbollah, was
quoted earlier Friday by the leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir as
saying ``We expect sharp complications in resolving the hostage
question in the future.''
   As-Safir quoted Musawi, interviewed at his headquarters in the
Bekaa valley city of Baalbek, as saying that the United States had
not responded appropriately to the release of Reed and Polhill.

<HEAD>Gang Crime Falls on City's South Side; Police Volunteers Credited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of gang crime have fallen by more
than a third in the section that accounted for half the city's gang
violence a year ago, and police crackdowns and neighborhood
involvement are being credited.
   During the first three months of this year, gang crime reported
to the Police Department's South Bureau fell by 36 percent compared
with the same period last year, police statistics show.
Gang-related murders dropped 45 percent.
   In contrast, gang crimes jumped 34 percent in the Central Bureau
and 18 percent in the West Bureau for the three-month period.
   Authorities said that in the past year a flood of staff members
and volunteers from Community Youth Gang Services, Brotherhood
Crusade, the Nation of Islam, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and other groups have painted over gang graffiti,
developed job programs, and started street patrols in South Side
neighborhoods.
   ``Up until this year, we had 50 percent of the city's gang
problem in South Bureau. Now it's in the low 40 percent range,''
said South Bureau Deputy Chief William Rathburn. ``I think we are
seeing a significant trend and I am optimistic that we can sustain
it.''
   But police and community leaders agreed that gang violence is
still a major problem in the 58-square-mile area that is home to
550,000 people.
   ``We've made merely a good beginning,'' said Danny Bakewell,
Brotherhood Crusade president. ``Now, it's up to all of us who give
rhetoric to the problem to demonstrate our commitment on an ongoing
basis.''

<HEAD>Afghan Troops Battle Guerrillas as Emergency Rule Ends</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan soldiers battled Islamic
guerrillas around the eastern city of Jalalabad on Friday, hours
after the government ended its 15-month state of emergency in the
country, state-run radio reported.
   Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, said ``a number of
political opponents'' were killed in the fighting and large amounts
of weapons and ammunition destroyed. It said nothing of government
casualties.
   The radio said forces loyal to President Najibullah recaptured
key outposts around the city in an offensive that began Tuesday.
   Fighting has flared and faded since the guerrillas attempted a
conventional assault on Jalalabad in March 1989, three weeks after
the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.
   The radio also said government forces pushed back guerrillas
surrounding the southern cities of Kandahar and Khost, with heavy
fighting and aerial bombardment under way.
   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors,
said up to 165 soldiers at Khost were killed or wounded when
government planes bombed the garrison Wednesday in the fear the
soldiers planned to defect.
   The reports could not be independently verified.
   Emergency rule was lifted at midnight Thursday. Najibullah, who
uses only one name, had promised it would end by May 20.
   The emergency was imposed just after Soviet troops ended nine
years of direct involvement and pulled out of Afghanistan in
February 1989. The decree gave Najibullah power to override
Parliament and placed Afghanistan's defense under the control of a
supreme military council.
   Lifting the emergency cleared the way for constitutional reforms
aimed at ending the 12-year-old war, which has killed more than 1
million people, destroyed much of the country and ruined its
economy.
   The president named a 15-member committee to call a loya jirga,
or grand assembly, to adopt constitutional reforms. It will consist
of an estimated 8,000 people representing different regions and
tribal groups in Afghanistan.
   Najibullah reportedly wants guerrillas among the committee
members. The former ``terrorists and bandits'' now are called
``opposition members.''
   The seven Pakistan-based guerrilla groups, bankrolled by the
United States and by Saudi Arabia and other sympathetic Arab
states, tacitly offered to let Najibullah test his popularity in
U.N.-run elections, provided he hands over power to a transitional
government.
   Najibullah rejects this, and appointment of the council was seen
as his response to the guerrillas.
   The mujahedeen control 80 percent of the countryside. The
Marxist-style government controls the cities.

<TEXT>
   The president of Mongolia, where fast-moving
political reforms stand in contrast to the hard line in Beijing,
arrived Friday for a visit aimed at forging a new relationship.
   Ties between China and Soviet-allied Mongolia have been strained
the past three decades, and President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat is the
first Mongolian head of government to visit China since 1962.
   Ochirbat, here at the invitation of Chinese President Yang
Shangkun, is seeking greater economic exchanges and access to a
Chinese port for landlocked Mongolia.
   Mongolia's ruling Communist Party has given up its monopoly on
power and has promised free elections this summer. A number of
opposition parties have sprung up since the reform movement,
inspired by similar campaigns in the Soviet Union and East Europe,
began last December.
   However, the reforms have sparked unrest, including a wave of
protests reported in Mongolia as Orchirbat began his visit.
   China reportedly has stepped up surveillance of its 3.5 million
Mongol minority out of concern the democratic impulses of Mongolia
could spill across the border. Chinese Premier Li Peng indicated
Friday that Beijing expects Mongolia to do what it can to keep that
from happening.
   Li said the two countries should have ``non-interference in each
other's internal and party affairs.''
   In Mongolia, sit-ins demanding replacement of the
Communist-dominated legislature were being staged in a half-dozen
Mongolian cities and a hunger strike continued in the northern city
of Moron, a foreign source in the capital of Ulan Bator said.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said five of the
17 hunger strikers, some of whom stopped eating last Saturday, had
been hospitalized.
   The source also said talks between the government and opposition
groups seeking a faster pace of democratic reform had stalled.
Opposition activists on Thursday said no new talks were scheduled
with the government.
   The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported that
Mongolian Prime Minister Sharavyn Gunjaadorg had accused opposition
groups of causing ``political panic'' with their ``unbridled
activities.'' It said the comments came in a televised speech
Thursday night.
   The government has accused the opposition of refusing an offer
to hold a national referendum on disbanding the legislature and
replacing it with a provisional multiparty body that would govern
until elections, the source said.
   About 25 to 30 people were taking part in the sit-in in the main
square of Ulan Bator. The demonstration, which began May 2,
attracted 300 to 400 people Thursday night. There were few police
in view.
   Opposition leaders were criticizing Ochirbat for traveling to
China when the country was facing a political crisis, the source
said.
   At a banquet Friday night hosted by Yang, Ochirbat called his
visit an important step in furthering political, economic, cultural
and scientific cooperation.
   Other details of the talks were not available, but it was likely
they discussed the easing of tensions along the Sino-Mongolian
border as well as trade and other bilateral issues.
   China has long objected to the heavy concentration of Soviet
troops in Mongolia, many stationed along the desert and grassland
frontier that divides Mongolia and China. However, the Soviet Union
last year began withdrawing its troops, and says the last of 60,000
Soviet soldiers will leave Mongolia by 1992.
   Mongolia, which has a population of only 2 million in a nation
nearly as big as all of West Europe, became the world's second
communist state in 1921.
   China, which in the past laid claims to all of Mongolia, did not
recognize the Soviet-allied state until the Chinese Communists came
to power in 1949.
   Relations were good during the 1950s, but from 1960 onward
Mongolia joined the Soviet Union in splitting with China over
ideological differences. Ties began to slowly improve as
Sino-Soviet tensions eased from the mid-1980s.

   President Bush said Friday that nuclear
weapons must continue to play a key role in safeguarding Europe
from war, declaring, ``There are few lessons so clear in history as
this.''
   While offering an advanced timetable for negotiating with Moscow
on reducing short-range nuclear arms, Bush declared, ``The United
States is not going to allow Europe to become `safe for
conventional war.'''
   Bush, discussing the changing face of Europe during a
commencement speech at Oklahoma State University, hailed the sweep
of democracy through Warsaw Pact nations.
   However, he cautioned, ``Our enemy today is uncertainty and
instability.''
   Bush said, ``It will be crucial to see ... whether Moscow
chooses coercion or peaceful dialogue in responding to the
aspirations of the Lithuanian people and nationalities within the
Soviet Union.''
   Bush's remarks were intended to offer the outlines of a new
military and political mission for NATO as Europe is transformed by
the reunification of Germany and the collapse of communist
governments.
   Leaders of the 16 NATO nations will meet in London in late June
or early July to chart a revised strategy for the 41-year-old
alliance.
   Bush said the allies should accelerate work to determine ``the
minimum number and types of weapons that will be needed to deter
war, credibly and effectively.''
   He said Moscow and Washington should open negotiations to reduce
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe once a treaty is signed _
perhaps later this year _ to curb troops and conventional arms.
   Originally, Bush had insisted that a conventional arms treaty
not only be signed but also implemented before talks could begin on
short-range nuclear forces.
   However, Bush said that as the Soviet Union pulls back troops
from Warsaw Pact nations, ``there is less need for nuclear systems
of the shortest range.''
   Acting on Bush's suggestion, NATO scrapped plans Thursday to
deploy more powerful short-range Lance nuclear missiles and
artillery shells in Europe. Even so, the United States and Soviet
Union will still maintain sizeable short-range nuclear arsenals in
Europe.
   ``We're prepared to negotiate the reduction of these forces as
well,'' the president.
   Yet, Bush said he did not want to leave Europe vulnerable to
conventional warfare.
   ``There are few lessons so clear in history as this: Only the
combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces have ensured
this long peace in Europe,'' Bush said.
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters on Air
Force One under condition of anonymity, said, ``We think there
needs to be some nuclear weapons in Europe. Deterrence has to have
a nuclear component.''
   In his speech, Bush said the United States ``should remain a
European power in the broadest sense _ politically, militarily and
economically'' and that ``militarily significant'' U.S. forces
would be stationed in Europe.
   As the military threat in Europe fades, Bush said, NATO's
political role will become more prominent.
   He said NATO leaders, at their summer summit, ``should look for
ways to help our German friends sustain freedom and achieve unity _
something which we and our allies have supported for over 40 years.
   ``And we should reaffirm the importance of keeping a united
Germany a full member of NATO.''
   Bush said NATO also must develop a new strategy for its
conventional forces, which include tanks, troops and non-nuclear
artillery.
   ``If the Soviet withdrawal continues and our arms control
efforts are successful, we must plan for a different kind of
military presence, focused less on the danger of an immediate
outbreak of war,'' the president said.
   Another objective for the summit, Bush said, is to determine how
the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
could help spread democracy and facilitate the transition from
government-control economies to free markets.
   The Oklahoma students, listening to Bush outdoors at a football
stadium, gave him a warm welcome but sat silently throughout most
of his address, which was laced with arms-control jargon and
acronyms.
   From Stillwater, Bush flew to Tulsa to address the Oklahoma
Foundation for Excellence as it honored 100 outstanding high school
seniors and four teachers. He also attended a state GOP fundraising
reception.
   ``Let's be honest. Our educational system isn't making the
grade,'' Bush said, urging programs such as magnet schools and
incentives for students to excel in science, math and engineering.
   After a late-night flight home, Bush was spending the weekend at
Camp David.

<HEAD>Former Navy Official To Plead Guilty In Procurement Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy official agreed to plead
guilty to charges of conspiracy and conversion of government
property for supplying confidential bidding information to
competitors for a Marine Corps contract, prosecutors announced
Friday.
   The defendant, George G. Stone, could be fined $250,000 on each
count and receive a 10-year prison sentence for conversion and five
years for conspiracy if the plea bargain is accepted in court.
   Stone becomes the 37th defendant to plead guilty or be convicted
in the massive defense procurement investigation code named ``Ill
Wind'' that began in 1986.
   According to the plea bargain filed in U.S. District Court by
the U.S. attorney's office, Stone has agreed to cooperate with the
investigation. Other counts, including charges of wire fraud, will
be dropped, the government said.
   The government's statement of facts filed in support of the plea
agreement said Stone arranged for Norden Systems, a subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp., to make the cut in 1987 and 1988 when
the Space and Naval Warfare Command was choosing finalists in a
10-company competition to supply a radar-based command system for
tactical aircraft.
   Norden was not among the three finalists but was added at
Stone's insistence, according to the statement.
   The government said Stone passed information about bid proposals
to Mark E. Saunders, a private consultant, who in turn passed it to
another consultant, Thomas E. Muldoon. Muldoon and Saunders also
were charged with conspiracy in the case.
   At one time or another, Muldoon passed information to three
companies _ Unisys, Litton Corp. and Norden _ the government said.
At first he worked for Litton, but when Litton found out its
proposal trailed the others, it released Muldoon and he signed on
with Norden. Muldoon never had a contract with Unisys, the
government said.
   Muldoon has been convicted of bribing an official in another
case and sentenced to 27 months in prison. He is appealing that
conviction. Last month U.S. District Judge Arthur Bryan dismissed
an indictment against Muldoon he said appeared to have been
``vindictive,'' brought out of pique over the appeal.
   Three Norden executives have pleaded guilty to taking part in
Muldoon's operation.

   Ethanol used in nuclear waste storage tanks

explosive hazard there in nine months.
   But federal officials, state regulators and Hanford critics all
played down the ethanol problem Friday, saying it was easy to fix.
   The air of calm was in contrast to earlier revelations about
explosive threats from ferrocyanide and a hydrogen gas buildup.
   ``This will be resolved in the next few days,'' said Ken Morgan
of the DOE's Richland Operations office in a telephone interview.
   Jim Thomas of the Spokane-based Hanford Education Action League
said the ethanol danger is not as serious as the potential danger
from the hydrogen gas buildup, but was another example of inept
management by the Energy Department.
   ``They were introducing a potentially energetic chemical in
tanks that have very dangerous wastes in them,'' Thomas said.
``This has gone on for years.''
   The latest concern centers on the tubes that run the length of
Hanford's giant nuclear waste storage tanks.
   The tubes contain probes that use sound waves to take readings
of the contents of the tanks. The tubes are filled with liquid to
better conduct the sound, Morgan said. Usually the liquid is water
but during cold months an antifreeze, ethanol, is added, he said.
   There were six tubes recently tested and in one case the ethanol
fumes were gathering at the top of the tube in a potentially
explosive quantity, Morgan said.
   The suspect tube will either be diluted with water or pumped
out, Morgan said.
   The tubes are about three inches in diameter and 45 feet long,
and sealed at the bottom so nothing inside them actually makes
contact with the waste, Morgan said.
   Ethanol has been used for years in the monitoring tubes of many
tanks, said Mike Berriochoa of Westinghouse Hanford Co., the
government contractor that operates the Hanford tank farms.
Berriochoa said he was not sure how many tubes Westinghouse would
need to remove ethanol from.
   The exploding tanks controversy began last October, when the
staff of Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, released a 1984 report that
concluded some storage tanks at Hanford contained ferrocyanide that
could explode.
   A flurry of analyses has since concluded that the risk from
ferrocyanide is quite low.
   But in studying that issue, DOE scientists uncovered a new
threat from hydrogen gas that was building up underneath the hard
crust inside about 20 waste storage tanks at Hanford.
   The Energy Department announced that hazard in late March, and
said they could not guarantee an explosion would not occur. That
produced a whole new round of tank studies, which so far have
concluded that the explosion risk is low. But the Energy Department
also admits it does not yet have enough data for a solution.
   Morgan acknowledged that extensive criticism focusing on the
Energy Department in the recent controversies prompted officials to
call reporters with the latest news.
   ``We're a little touchy,'' he said.
   Hanford has 177 nuclear waste storage tanks which contain the
highly radioactive byproducts of more than 40 years of plutonium
production for nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Contras Open Talks With Government on Disbanding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
began talks Friday with Contra rebels who are refusing to disband
as promised, and pledged that the military role in Nicaragua's new
government will diminish ``little by little and as soon as
possible.''
   The Contras, who fought a U.S.-backed war against the previous
leftist Sandinista government, had said they would disband by June
10. But now they are indicating they will not meet that deadline.
   Mrs. Chamorro made her remarks as she began closed talks with
the rebels. Their demands include a reduction of the Sandinista
army, by far the largest in Central America.
   Members of Mrs. Chamorro's Cabinet and Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo of Nicaragua are also attending the talks.
   Contra leader Israel Galeano said the fact that the Contras are
meeting with Mrs. Chamorro shows a willingness to work to rebuild
``a society that is destroyed.''
   Many Contras are angry over Mrs. Chamorro's decision to keep
Gen. Humberto Ortega as head of the army, although she said the
post would be temporary.
   Ortega, brother of former President Daniel Ortega, had been
defense minister under the Sandinistas.
   When Mrs. Chamorro took office April 15 she charged Gen. Ortega
with coming up with a program for reducing the armed forces. She
said Ortega would stay on as head of the army until the Contras
were disarmed.
   ``What we want is to rebuild our country in peace, in
reconciliation and also to demilitarize our country,'' the
president said Friday.
   Mrs. Chamorro did not say if the army would be reduced at the
same time the Contras were disbanded.
   Former President Ortega earlier promised that the Sandinistas
``will not at any time promote a policy of revenge with disarmed
and disbanded Contra forces.''
   Before turning over power the Sandinistas distributed thousands
of weapons to their supporters, who have vowed publicly not to give
them back.
   Aristides Sanchez, a Contra spokesman, implied Thursday that the
rebels will not hand in their weapons to U.N. representatives by
June 10, as they had pledged to do in an April 19 agreement.
   ``One doesn't have to be so airtight about it,'' Sanchez replied
when asked if the rebels planned to meet the deadline.
   Roberto Ferrey, a spokesman for Mrs. Chamorro's government and
himself a former Contra, said the government would not yield to the
rebel demand.
   ``June 10 is the deadline: it's not possible to change it,'' he
said.
   About 30,000 people died in the struggle between the
American-backed Contras and the leftist Sandinista regime.

   A woman who once posed nude for Playboy with
her twin sister was convicted Friday of evading taxes on money she
allegedly got from an elderly millionaire in exchange for sex.
   Prosecutors contended Lynnette Harris and her sister collected
more than $1 million in cash, real estate, furs and other goods
from the late David Kritzik for spending alternate nights with him.
   A U.S. District jury found Ms. Harris, 35, guilty of two felony
counts of tax evasion and two misdemeanor counts of failing to file
income tax returns.
   The charges involve her failure to report as income $686,000 she
received from Kritzik from 1984 to 1987. The taxes amount to
$260,000, said U.S. Attorney Mel Johnson.
   She could be sentenced to a maximum of 12 years in prison and
fined $626,000.
   Her identical twin sister, Leigh Ann Conley, is to be tried in
June on similar charges involving allegedly unpaid taxes on
$397,000.
   In testimony, Ms. Harris denied she was a prostitute and
testified Kritzik cared for her ``as a husband takes care of a
wife.''
   Ms. Harris contended the money she received during the course of
her relationship with Kritzik, a Milwaukee businessman, amounted to
gifts rather than taxable income.
   Her attorney said the verdict would be appealed.
   Kritzik, who died in June at age 89, founded the General
Merchandise Co. mail-order house and the Treasure Island discount
chain.
   The blonde twins appeared nude together in two movies and in a
1981 edition of Playboy.
   In lawsuits seeking money from Kritzik's estate and damages from
his son, Stanley, Ms. Harris said she and Kritzik had an oral
agreement that she would travel with him and provide companionship
in exchange for money.
   But in her testimony during the trial, she said there was no
agreement, that she and Kritzik had a ``normal relationship between
a man and a woman.''
   Ms. Harris left the courtroom without speaking to reporters, one
of her attorneys, Dave Geraghty, said she was ``very disappointed.''
   ``She believes in her innocence and so do we,'' Geraghty said.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Curran scheduled sentencing for July
25.

   Soldiers wearing civilian clothes entered a
Palestinian refugee camp Friday and seized a fugitive wanted in the
murder of at least six fellow Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab reports said.
   The army said its soldiers shot and seriously wounded Nasser
Muhammad Abu Ihmaid, 19, in the al-Amari camp in the occupied West
Bank when he tried to flee, armed with a pistol.
   Arab reporters said the soldiers waited in a car across from the
camp mosque for Ihmaid to come out. Camp residents knew him as
``the masked lion'' and said he was responsible for killing Arabs
thought to be collaborators, the reporters said.
   The army accused Ihmaid of taking part in the murder of six
Palestinians.
   At least 210 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
mainly on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities,
during the 29-month-old revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories.
   Israelis have killed 681 Palestinians during the rebellion, and
43 Israelis have also died in the violence.
   Security forces on Friday demolished two houses in the refugee
camp, five miles north of Jerusalem, belonging to Palestinians
suspected of attacking alleged collaborators, Arab reports said.
   Police in Hebron detained two Israelis accused of stoning Arab
cars from their vehicle as they drove through the West Bank,
causing at least one wreck, Israel television reported.
   It said the two had in their possession stones, paint and
leaflets from Rabbi Meir Kahane's extremist Kach movement.

   Seventeen Marines suffered
injuries in the rough landing of a helicopter troopship at a desert
training area Friday afternoon, a Marine Corps spokesman said.
   Medical personnel late Friday were examining the extent of
injuries to the Marines hurt in the 2:15 p.m. accident at the
Marine Air-Ground Combat Center, Capt. Timothy Hoyle said.
   The injured, most of them based at Camp Pendleton, flew in
another aircraft for treatment at the Navy hospital at Twentynine
Palms, about 140 miles northeast of Los Angeles, Hoyle said.
   The helicopter, a CH-46E Sea Knight, and its crew of three
belong to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, headquartered at the Marine
Corps Air Station in El Toro, Calif.
   Investigators searched for the cause of the accident, Hoyle
said. The severity of damage to the aircraft was not immediately
known.
   The 25-passenger Sea Knight, an assault helicopter in service
since the Vietnam War, was participating in helicopter-borne
assault training.

   Charles Manson ``family'' member
Charles ``Tex'' Watson lost his 10th bid for parole Friday in the
1969 cult killings of actress Sharon Tate and six others.
   Watson, serving a life sentence at the California Men's Colony,
was slow to express remorse and remains a threat to others,
according to a psychiatric report cited by the parole panel that
rejected his request.
   The three-member Board of Prison Terms panel ruled that Watson,
44, must wait the maximum three years to reapply for release.
   Watson was convicted of leading three women in the brutal
killings on orders of Manson, leader of the self-styled family of
outcasts.
   The pregnant Miss Tate was stabbed and hanged in her home in Los
Angeles' Laurel Canyon Aug. 9, 1969. Also killed were her
houseguests Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger and Voityck Frykowski and
caretaker Steven Parent.
   The next night, grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary,
were killed at their Los Angeles home.
   On hand to oppose Watson's release Friday was Miss Tate's
mother, Doris Tate, who has worked to keep the Manson family
members behind bars.
   ``I feel that she (Sharon) has to be represented in that hearing
room,'' Mrs. Tate said before the hearing. ``If they're pleading
for their lives, then I have to be there representing her _ how she
lost her life and how she pleaded for her life, and how her pleas
were ignored.''
   Manson was convicted of masterminding the slayings, which
prosecutors contended were part of a deranged plan to perpetrate a
race war. Also convicted in the case were Patricia Krenwinkel,
Susan Atkins and Leslie Van Houten _ in carrying out the killings.
   All five were originally sentenced to death but their sentences
were reduced to life imprisonment when a 1972 Supreme Court ruling
overturned the California death penalty law that existed at the
time. All five have been rejected for parole repeatedly and remain
in prison.
   In prison, Watson has studied data processing and office machine
repair program. He served as assistant chaplain in the prison for
12 years before being removed from the post in 1987 because of
complaints that he intimidated other prisoners.

   Marla Maples may have to wait a while longer to
see her name in lights instead of banner headlines.
   The so-called other woman in the Trump marital split auditioned
for Madonna's role in the national tour of the Broadway show
``Speed-the-Plow.'' But she didn't get it.
   ``Marla was actually quite good,'' Gene Wolsk, a co-producer,
told The New York Times.
   ``But even before we came to any decision, her people asked
about the length of the tour and she was hesitant about committing
herself for that period of time.''
   The model-actress has had a couple bit parts in movies. In
``Maximum Overdrive,'' she was crushed by a watermelon truck. Her
most-talked-about modeling credit was as a bikini-clad pinup for
Delta Air Lines' ``Fly Florida'' ad campaign.
   The rock star Madonna starred as an office temp working for two
Hollywood producers in playwright David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,''
a scathing look at greed and glory in the film industry.
   The upcoming tour will star Elliott Gould and George Segal. It
is scheduled to last nine months.
   Brooke Shields has also been mentioned as a possibility for the
role originally played by Madonna. But Wolsk told the Times the
producers were now thinking about casting an actress who did not
necessarily have ``a name.''

<TEXT>
   Caryl Churchill doesn't make things easy for an
audience.
   The proof is currently on stage at the New York Shakespeare
Festival Public Theater where a double bill of two short works by
the English playwright is puzzling theatergoers.
   The title _ ``Ice Cream With Hot Fudge'' _ is deceptively sweet.
The two plays are not.
   ``Hot Fudge,'' the shorter and more arcane of the plays, begins
with a chorus of lower-class Brits plotting an intricate
check-cashing scam. Their greed is similiar to the money-grubbing
celebrated by the stockbrokers Churchill skewered in ``Serious
Money,'' her last New York outing.
   Much of the dialogue in ``Hot Fudge'' is overlapping, making it
impossible to understand clearly. You get the idea, if not the
actual words. The avarice goes upscale in the next scene or two
when Ruby (Margaret Whitton) pairs off with Colin (John Pankow) and
meets his wealthy friends.
   People talk about their careers in ``global industry'' or their
``self-development vacations'' or their homes as ``investments.''
But there's a nastiness underneath the chic cocktail chatter that
doesn't become apparent until Ruby is confronted by Colin's ex-wife
(Julianne Moore). The confrontation _ and the play _ end in
violence, and the bleak realization that nothing is as it seems.
   ``Ice Cream,'' composed of 20 short scenes, is the more
substantial, dangerous dessert. The black, often bewildering,
comedy illustrates Churchill's disenchantment with romantic notions
of both England and the United States.
   Two innocent American tourists, Lance and Vera, find delight in
everything British _ from the way the natives say ``ice cream'' to
all those ancient buildings to even discovering distant cousins of
Lance's.
   But these relatives are not Mr. Micawber and Mary Poppins. They
are vindictive, uncouth, slightly menacing people who end up
murdering their landlord. And they draw their American cousins into
the crime.
   When the English brother and sister visit America, they are
similiarly misinformed about the habits of the foreign land. But
Churchill's scalpel is not nearly as sharp in her dissection of
American life and culture. Her portrait of two rural bumpkins, for
example, seems straight out of ``The Beverely Hillbillies,'' only
not as funny.
   The violence the British couple committed in England follows
them to America. And it dogs the American husband and wife, too.
It's a chilly link between the two nations.
   The play ends weirdly, unexpectedly. In fact, many in the
audience at a recent performance didn't know it was over until the
actors came out to take their bows.
   The cast is competent rather than inspired except for John
Pankow, who plays the disturbed Colin in ``Hot Fudge'' and a
variety of very different small roles in ``Ice Cream'' with
distinction.
   Director Les Waters certainly keeps the plays moving quickly,
helped by the minimal settings of stark, sliding walls. Churchill's
plays are just as stark, keeping the audience off-balance. But that
may be her main goal.
   ``Ice Cream With Hot Fudge'' is more unnerving than entertaining.

   Three white former lawmen convicted of
murdering a black prisoner were sentenced Friday to prison terms
ranging from 10 to 28 years.
   The prosecutor had sought life terms in the case, which drew
wide attention in the state from activists who contend mistreatment
of blacks by white police officers is common.
   Loyal Garner Jr., 34-year-old black man who has six children,
died after being beaten in his cell following a drunken driving
arrest 2{ years ago.
   The defendants _ former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner and
former Sabine County sheriff's deputies Billy Ray Horton and James
M. Hyden _ were convicted Thursday.
   Ladner was sentenced to 28 years, Hyden to 14 years and Horton
to 10 years.
   ``I'm glad. I'm happy that they were convicted and they got
time,'' said the victim's widow, Corrine Garner. ``I'm going to go
home and raise my kids.''
   Loyal Garner Sr. had hoped for longer sentences for the men who
killed his son. But the victim's mother, Sarah Garner, said: ``I'm
satisfied that some kind of justice has been done.''
   Horton and Hyden were allowed to remain free on appeal bonds of
$25,000 because their sentences were less than 15 years. Ladner was
taken into custody.
   Prosecutor Jack Skeen had urged jurors to go to the limit in
choosing among sentencing alternatives ranging from five to 99
years or life in prison and fines up to $10,000. The defendants
will be eligible for parole because they had no prior convictions.
   The three were acquitted in 1988 of civil rights violation
charges in Garner's death, and have appeals pending on grounds the
murder trial constituted double jeopardy.
   Black activists have hailed Thursday's verdict as a victory for
racial justice.
   They monitored the case, along with the slaying of a black
Houston woman by a Hispanic police officer during a gunfight while
the officer was off-duty. The officer was convicted last week of
manslaughter.
   So emotional was the atmosphere in the courtroom Friday that the
prosecutor wept along with some in the audience as he gave closing
arguments in the punishment phase of the trial.
   ``Establish by your verdict the real meaning of Smith County
justice,'' Skeen told the all-white jury in arguing for life terms.
``This is Loyal Garner Jr.'s last chance.''
   Hyden was the only defendant to testify during the punishment
phase. He pointed out that he has a wife and three children, and he
believes he could live up to the rules of probation.
   Skeen later criticized Hyden's brief statement, saying ``Not one
time did he indicate any remorse.''
   Wagner's attorney, John Seale, compared Skeen's efforts to put
the three former lawmen in prison to those of a lynch mob.
   ``On one occasion, these men got mad, lost their temper and
overreacted,'' Seale said. ``We all lose our tempers.''
   Defense attorneys said they fear for their clients' lives if
they were imprisoned because of retribution by other inmates.
   Garner, from Florien, La., died Dec. 27, 1987, of severe head
injuries. The former officers claimed they struck Garner in
self-defense when he became unruly in the jail.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Children Removed From Unlicensed Boarding Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUCEDALE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday ordered children
removed from an unlicensed church boarding home for troubled teens
after a youth testified he and others were beaten and forced to
work long hours.
   But when authorities went to the Children's Home in Lucedale,
there were no children present.
   The Rev. Herman Fountain, a fundamentalist minister who has been
battling authorities for at least two years over allegations of
beatings and other abuse at the home, refused to say where the
children were.
   He said he would continue accepting children, despite previous
court orders to the contrary, ``to keep them off the street.''
   In 1988, authorities removed 70 children from the home. But
efforts to keep Fountain from accepting boarders since have led to
a long string of legal disputes.
   Prosecutors presently are seeking criminal penalties against
Fountain for failing to register the home under a new state law
covering residential care for minors.
   The minister refuses to seek a state license, saying he answers
only to God's law.
   ``I'm through playing their games,'' Fountain said. ``I'm going
to do what the Lord tells me to do and just go on.''
   Friday's order to remove children was issued by youth court
Chancellor Robert Oswald after a 16-year-old boy who ran away from
the home testified about his 13 days there. They teen-ager said
Fountain forced more than a dozen children at the 28-acre church
campus to work nine or ten hours a day on various chores.
   Fountain disputed the accusations in a telephone interview.
   ``He's lying about most of it,'' Fountain said of the boy's
testimony. ``He said he only got four hours of sleep a night, and
that's a lie. He said he was going to get a spanking, and that was
true. But I didn't get a chance to.''
   The hearing was to continue May 15.
   Also Friday, Fountain failed to appear at a contempt hearing
over his refusal to obey an earlier court order against operating
the home.
   ``I know I'm justified in violating it,'' Fountain said of the
court order.

   Anti-government demonstrators calling
for radical reform and the resignation of interim president Ion
Iliescu protested in three Romanian cities Friday as a top minister
cautioned that real economic change would take 10 years.
   Romania needs at least a decade to switch from a centralized
Communist economy to a free market system, the national economy
minister Tudorel Postolache told a news conference.
   The transfer to a market economy ''should not be done by shock
therapy, but gradually,'' Postolache said in an apparent swipe at
those arguing for more radical change.
   About 500 anti-government demonstrators, meanwhile, protested
for the 13th day in the capital's downtown University Square. They
demanded that Iliescu resign and that he and all other former
Communists be barred from political life.
   Similar demonstrations were reported by the state news agency
Rompres from Brasov, Romania's second city, and from the western
town of Timisoara, the birthplace of the December revolution that
toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The Brasov demonstration has gone on since Sunday, Rompres said.
On that day, about 40,000 people gathered in Timisoara to call for
the resignation of Iliescu, the favorite in the May 20 presidential
elections.
   Iliescu's National Salvation Front has dominated politics in
Romania since the revolution. Opposition parties who have
threatened to boycott the May 20 elections charge the Front is
using public funds for electioneering and exploiting its access to
television.
   Ion Ratiu, the millionaire businessman who returned from 50
years in British exile to become the presidential candidate for the
National Peasants' Party, on Friday charged that the Front was
attacking campaign workers from his party.
   Ratiu said at a news conference that 60 such attacks had
occurred over the past week, including one on his British wife
Elisabeth. He said the opposition may boycott the election unless
Iliescu ``calls his troops to order.''

   American Continental Corp., the controversial
savings and loan company, would be liquidated under a plan
presented Friday by federal regulators and the company's unsecured
creditors.
   The plan, which must be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge,
calls for the ouster of American Continental's controversial
chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr.
   It would require the company's failed savings and loan
subsidiary, California-based Lincoln Savings and Loan, to pay $21
million to settle numerous lawsuits against it.
   The plan was proposed jointly by the unsecured creditors
committee and the government's Resolution Trust Corp., the entity
charged with cleaning up the nation's savings and loan mess. The
RTC runs Lincoln Savings, which was seized by regulators in April
1989.
   An attorney for Keating complained he hadn't been consulted
about the plan, which seeks to separate the affairs of Lincoln and
American Continental.
   ``I think it's an end run around us,'' said Keating attorney
James J. Feder, who learned of the plan at a bankruptcy court
hearing. ``The government has refused to negotiate with us. ...
This is the showcase, so they refuse to discuss it with us and
instead go to the creditors committee.''
   The settlement doesn't affect an RTC civil lawsuit against
Keating. That suit accuses Keating and other Lincoln insiders of
racketeering, alleging they conspired to buy Lincoln for the
purpose of diverting federally insured deposits to their own use.
   Keating's contributions to influential lawmakers figure in an
ethics probe of five U.S. Senators. The lawmakers met with
regulators on behalf of Lincoln.
   The proposal was presented at a hearing before U.S. District
Judge Richard M. Bilby, who is overseeing American Continental's
Chapter 11 filing. That section of the federal bankruptcy law
allows a company to reorganize under court supervision and remain a
going concern.
   Details of the proposal are to be presented at a later hearing.
   All claims against Lincoln by the unsecured creditors would be
dismissed under the settlement in exchange for $21 million. A
majority of the creditors are investors who say they lost more than
$200 million on ``junk bonds'' sold by American Continental.
Lawsuits contend that as many as 23,000 people were persuaded to
buy the risky bonds American Continental or Lincoln employees.
   The deal, negotiated by lawyers for the unsecured creditors,
must be approved by a vote of the creditors themselves.
   ``Instead of the former adversarial relationship between the RTC
and the creditors committee, both parties will now work
cooperatively to unwind the corporate affairs of ACC and Lincoln
and to investigate and pursue claims against various persons who
... may have injured Lincoln and ACC,'' RTC special counsel Rex
Veal said in a news release.

   Freed U.S. hostage Frank Reed
left for the United States today, and just before taking off
criticized the British government because two British citizens
remain captive in Lebanon.
   ``They are my best mates, those guys, we're going to get them
out,'' Reed said of Brian Keenan and John McCarthy, shortly before
he left the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden to begin his
journey back to the United States.
   Asked if he thought the British government should do more to win
the release of McCarthy and Keenan, Reed replied: ``You bet they
should be.'' He did not elaborate.
   Reed, his wife and their 9-year-old son flew out of the
Wiesbaden Air Base at 10:09 a.m. (4:09 a.m. EDT), heading for
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland aboard a C-20 aircraft.
   The founder of a private school in Beirut, Reed was the second
American hostage to be freed in nine days. Robert Polhill, freed
April 22, went through the same battery of medical tests and
questioning at the hospital last week.

   NATO has launched its drive to ensure
the Western military alliance does not become a rusted relic but
instead functions as a key component in new European security
structures.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner told a news conference
Thursday that the group ``is taking advantage of the historic
opportunity to move beyond confrontation to cooperation.''
   He was speaking at the end of a special meeting of foreign
ministers of the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. With reduced East-West tensions, NATO is under
pressure to reduce its military role and increase its political one.
   The officials also insisted that a united Germany remain in the
Western alliance, but Woerner said NATO does not intend to expand
its forces into the current territory of East Germany.

business of owning land and factories.
   With a self-imposed deadline of July 2 for merging their

Germany to a free market.
   Almost all property and enterprises were state-owned under the
Communist system that once controlled the country.

   Alaska is becoming a transit point for
Asian heroin and South American cocaine being smuggled into the
United States and Europe, authorities say.
   ``Possibly the couriers feel this is a less-traveled route,''
says Fred Thomas, chief agent of the Drug Enforcement
Administration office in Anchorage. ``Once they clear customs in
Alaska, that's it. Everything going to the Lower 48 is domestic.
   ``The amount of heroin seized here lately would indicate to me
it's a transshipment point,'' he said.
   Customs agents have intercepted several drug shipments at
Anchorage International Airport in recent months, but believe they
have staunched just a fraction of the incoming flow of narcotics.

   The opposition Labor Party has trounced Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in local elections,
making their best showing since she came to power 11 years ago,
tallies showed today.
   However, the Conservatives avoided the rout forecast by opinion
polls before Thursday's elections. The socialist Labor Party called
the balloting a referendum on Mrs. Thatcher's third term in office
and an unpopular new local tax that sparked massive protests.
   With results declared early today from 182 of the 201 local
councils, Labor had gained 10 councils to control 89. The
Conservatives, or Tories, lost eight for control of 36.
   The centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party took control of
three councils and lost three. No party had overall control in the
other councils.

Friday but plotted a more cautious break from the Soviet Union than

independence with tears, a chorus of the republic's traditional

   The 138-0 parliamentary vote, 50 years after Moscow seized the

homosexuality is a ``symptom of inner conflict'' often stemming
from a childhood devoid of proper male identity development.

<HEAD>China's Biggest City Has Big Plans for Urban Renewal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHANGHAI, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's largest city has announced plans
for an urban renaissance, but says it will take billions of
dollars, lots of political savvy and about 40 years.
   The Pudong Development Project has won Beijing's qualified
endorsement. Now, Shanghai must convince foreign investors there is
hope in this troubled metropolis.
   Most of Shanghai's 12 million people and thousands of factories
compete for land, air and water in teeming Puxi, on the west side
of the Huangpu River.
   The development of Pudong, east of the Huangpu, would shift
factories, homes and people to the 140-square-mile triangle of land
between that river and the Yangtze.
   Among things the city plans to do in the next five years are:
finish a third bridge across the Huangpu; start construction on a
port, power plant and waterworks; open an export processing zone
for foreign investors and complete a highway circling the city.
   Work on a subway linking the two sides of the river is to begin
this year. Planners envision more highways, another bridge, a
second international airport and apartments, hospitals and schools
for 1.7 million people in Pudong.
   Finance and trade centers, high-tech industries and science
centers are planned. Older factories in Puxi are to be moved to
Pudong and modernized.
   Shanghai's planners say all that and 40 years to accomplish it
will make a modern, efficient city of this former capitalist
enclave, which has been the overworked draft horse of cCommunist
China for the last 40.
   Zhu Rongji, Shanghai's energetic and ambitious mayor, told
reporters the city will need the equivalent of $10 billion in the
first decade.
   The national budget has allocated $1.38 billion over the next
five years. Much of the rest will have to come from foreign
investors and the city itself.
   According to the mayor, the climate for investment is ``better
than at any time in the past and especially better than the time
before last June.''
   He referred to pro-democracy demonstrations and, in June 1989,
the military crackdown that frightened off many potential investors
and drastically slowed loans from the World Bank and other
international lenders.
   The Asian Development Bank is backing the new Huangpu bridge and
a West German consortium has extended credit for more than half the
$500 million subway. Such lending, agreed upon before June, will be
crucial for the Pudong project.
   A Western diplomat in Shanghai did not share Zhu's optimism
about foreign money.
   He noted that foreign investment was down sharply so far this
year and that Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen were more interested
in the special economic zones of southern China.
   ``International lending is blocked up and foreign banks are not
exactly doing tricks to increase exposure in China,'' he said.
   Zhu offers major incentives.
   Foreign banks, now allowed to have branches only in the special
economic zones, will be invited to Shanghai. Joint ventures will be
given tax breaks like those in the zones.
   Businesses from abroad will be able to obtain leases of 50 to 70
years on large tracts of land for development, to issue bonds and
stocks and conduct stock trading inside and outside China.
   Shanghai also is blessed, for once, with strong support from
Beijing. Jiang Zemin, Zhu's predecessor as mayor, is general
secretary of the Communist Party and Zou Jiahua, chief of the
powerful Central Planning Commission, also is from Shanghai.
   Perhaps more important, the conservative politicians now on top
in Beijing see Shanghai, with its large state industries, as a
counterbalance to capitalism-tainted Canton and the special
economic zones in Guangdong and Fujian provinces.
   ``Even without the fear of creeping capitalism, it would make
sense for them to give fewer favors to Guangdong and try to help
out the older industrial bases,'' the Western diplomat said.
   Shanghai formerly had to pay nearly 90 percent of its earnings
to the state, providing about 10 percent of state revenues. That
left too little to repair a rapidly deteriorating infrastructure.
   Last year, it was allowed to keep about one-third of revenues,
still less than other provinces.
   The city ``made great contributions to the state in the past''
and it is time to return the favor, Zhu said.
   Premier Li Peng visited Shanghai in April and endorsed the
Pudong project as ``an event of important strategic significance
both to Shanghai and the whole country.'' He said the central
government ``will provide necessary support and the whole country
should give active support.''
   Li added, however, that the city ``should rely on the support
and efforts of the people of Shanghai.''
   In his remarks to reporters two weeks later, Zhu said the city
could gain $212 million a year just by making its antiquated
industrial base more efficient.
   He noted that Shanghai's people ``have lots of money in their
pockets,'' but also quoted a saying that they are ``clever but not
too wise'' _ more concerned with short-term profit than long-term
interests.
   Pudong will succeed, Zhu said, only if ``shortcomings in the
general mentality'' of the city are overcome.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Hailey takes a look at what might
happen when the news conflicts with the interests of a TV network's
corporate owner in his latest novel, ``The Evening News.''
   He concludes that corporate interests come first.
   ``I feel that I'm not alone in believing that the worst thing
that could happen to television news was the takeover of the three
networks by large corporations,'' Hailey said.
   ``The company that owns the network in my book is fictional, but
there's a lot of reality in the influence of the news by the
conglomerates. It's inevitable when people have power.
   ``I think, however, the competition between the networks will
prevent a lot of it. NBC is now owned by General Electric, a major
defense contractor. NBC used to do a lot of investigative report
into defense spending. I wonder if they will continue to do that.''
   At one time, the networks were not expected to turn a profit,
said Hailey, a former television dramatist turned novelist.
   ``It was William Paley, who founded CBS, who pioneered the
concept of a free and independent news department,'' he said.
   The manipulation of the news by the multinational corporate
owner of the fictional network in Hailey's book is only a small
part of ``The Evening News,'' published at $21.95 by Doubleday.
   It's essentially a thriller about the kidnapping of the family
of an anchorman. The news department learns the kidnappers are
terrorists from Peru, with which the corporation has just agreed to
develop a major resort. The corporation moves to suppress
unfavorable news about the country.
   Hailey's books include ``Airport,' ``Wheels,'' ``Hotel,'' ``The
Moneychangers'' and ``Strong Medicine.'' ``The Evening News'' will
be his last book to take on an American institution, he said.
   ``I'm now 70 and my health is not the best,'' he said.
   ``My publisher has offered me the same advance with no deadline
for the next book,'' he said. ``But a book takes three years of
hard work. I plan to write three novellas at my own pace and
publish them in one book.''
   Hailey, a Canadian citizen, lives in the Bahamas with his wife,
Sheila. Much of the book was written aboard their motor launch
while cruising among the islands.
   ``When I started the book all I knew was that I wanted to write
about television news and terrorists,'' he said. ``I felt
terrorists from the Middle East had been written about too much and
one producer told me about Peru and the Shining Path, a group with
ties to the drug traffickers.''
   He visited Peru twice. At his island home, he has a satellite
dish, so was able to keep up with news shows from U.S. networks
while working on the book.
   All of Hailey's previous major novels have been made into movies
or miniseries. But so far, he has rejected movie and miniseries
offers for ``The Evening News.''

<HEAD>Local Heroes: PBS Series Shows Individuals Make a Difference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Do not despair. The world is not coming to an
end. Individuals can make it a better place. That's the good news
these days from public television.
   Still, you're in no immediate danger of contracting that warm,
fuzzy feeling from programs like ``Local Heroes, Global Change,'' a
four-part documentary series opening on PBS tonight.
   ``What we have learned is that the world is extremely complex,
messy, that simple solutions and slogans don't work,'' said
Francisco Sagasti, head of strategic planning for the World Bank in
Washington.
   ``Local Heroes'' is one of a number of programs on public TV
trying to show what smart, committed people can do against hunger,
poverty and pollution, especially in developing nations.
   Using these people, PBS programmers and independent producers
can relate complex stories without oversimplifying them.
   ``There's been a lot of talk among programmers about doing news
from the bottom up rather than the top down,'' said Harry Chancey,
top programmer for PBS affiliate WNET in New York City. ``There's a
sense of excitement about letting the unremarkable people tell the
story.''
   The first episode of ``Local Heroes, Global Change'' considers
rice farming in Indonesia, where farmers learned that ecologically
balanced insect populations could supplant the government's
disastrous pesticide program.
   It also looks at a near-revolutionary loan program of the
Grameen (Rural) Bank of Bangladesh, which targets women and the
landless for loans to buy livestock and homes.
   The other episodes of the South Carolina ETV series will
consider the influences of politics, psychology and the global
economy on Third World development.
   The PBS series ``Profiles in Progress'' also focuses on local
heroes. A recent episode profiled Nepal, where deforestation and
infant mortality are interconnected issues of national survival.
   Nepal's infant mortality rate 20 years ago was 250 per 1,000
live births. Today, at 110 per thousand, it's still one of the
highest in the world. Yet the decrease and a traditionally high
birth rate have helped increase Nepal's population more than 50
percent since 1970, to 17 million people.
   That population puts pressure on the forests, the traditional
source of fuel and fodder. Since 1970, Nepal has lost one-third of
its forest, or 6 million acres of trees. Deforestation robs Nepal
of soil, beauty and, ultimately, the tourism that is a main source
of its foreign exchange.
   Its local heroes are Prabhakar Rana, a hotelier who pushes for
national game preserves and local forest management, and Dr. Yagya
Karki, a health official who produces videos on prenatal care and
midwifery, and enlists village women as advocates for family
planning.
   We can expect to see many more ``local heroes'' on PBS in the
weeks and months ahead. In October, Boston's WGBH will be offering
a 10-part series called ``The Race to Save the Planet.''
   Another kind of ``local hero'' is naturalist Jane Goodall, whose
30-year study of the chimpanzees of Tanzania's Gombe National Park
has expanded our understanding of human's closest relative.
   ``It's being there with the chimpanzees, being out of the rat
race, that gives me the energy to travel around lecturing and
meeting people,'' she says on HBO's documentary ``Chimps: So Like
Us,'' which airs on May 9.
   It's a beautifully photographed documentary on her work and her
deeply felt opposition to the inhumane use of chimps in medical
research.
   On May 20, TBS and the award-winning ``National Geographic
Explorer'' present ``The Life and Legend of Jane Goodall.''
   A little good news never hurt anybody.

   Cecilia Peck recognizes herself in the character
she portrays in the movie ``Torn Apart'' _ a woman struggling to
follow her heart even if it goes against her father's wishes.
   Cecilia, whose father is the actor Gregory Peck, appears with
Adrian Pasdar as star-crossed lovers, she an Arab schoolteacher,
Laila, and he an Israeli soldier, Ben.
   During the course of the plot, Laila is forced to confront her
father over the doomed romance.
   ``I really related to her having to go against her father to
follow her own heart,'' Peck said in a recent interview. ``And
that's the big conflict for Laila _ because she reveres him and
adores him but she has to follow her own heart. And I admired her
for that.
   ``That wouldn't happen with my dad because of the religious
reasons, but there are those circumstances when a father loves and
wants to protect his daughter and she has to find her own way.''
   For Peck, finding her own way as an actress has taken a
circuitous route.
   After earning a degree in English literature from Princeton
University, she moved to New York in the early 1980s to manage a
punk-new wave band called The Groceries.
   How did her parents react to their only daughter becoming a rock
'n' roller in New York? ``I think they kind of ignored the whole
thing and pretended it wasn't happening,'' Peck said with a hearty
laugh.
   When that gig ended, she became a story analyst for a film
company, reading scripts and providing synopses. That led to
writing plays, and studying acting to help the playwriting.
   Gradually, off-Broadway roles started coming her way.
   ``In retrospect, I think (acting) was something I wanted to do
but I was always academic and didn't think of myself as a
performer, but I think it was inside me,'' she said.
   ``When your parents are in the arts and you spend a lot of time
in the theater and around artists, it really captures your
imagination.''
   Though her performance is strong in ``Torn Apart,'' the film is
a flat redo of the ``Romeo and Juliet'' theme. Its characters are
too shallow, and the script too tepid to hook the viewer into
wanting to care about their worries and longings.
   The Israeli backdrop, however, is stunning _ the sweeping plains
and the dusty burnt sienna sunsets _ and makes for pleasant viewing.
   She says she has fond memories of growing up with her famous
father.
   ``I was always on his sets; I grew up on location with him; I
saw all his films. And I remember when I was little, when he won
the Oscar for `To Kill a Mockingbird,' I had given him a rabbit's
foot to have in his pocket.''
   Gregory Peck was careful to shield his four children from some
of the artificial trappings of Hollywood, she said.
   ``I didn't grow up in a mansion and I think my father took a lot
of care that we were normal. I think that's because they didn't
want us to take things for granted.''
   When she finally pursued acting, his advice was for her to get
good training. But the famous name hasn't opened any doors. In
fact, it sometimes works against her.
   ``I think us offspring are subjected to extra scrutiny,
especially early on, that maybe other actors don't have to contend
with,'' Peck said. ``And I know that in some situations and
auditions, people are skeptical about whether I'm serious about it
or well-trained or disciplined or really talented or whether I'm
assuming that things are going to be handed to me.
   ``But it just makes you focus on what you're doing, and there
aren't any short cuts. You can't get a job because of who you are,
you can only get it if you're good and you're serious about it.''
   Part of her aprenticeship has included studying with Herbert
Berghof and Uta Hagen. She got her first big role playing in the
cult movie, ``My Best Friend Is a Vampire.''
   ``It's a comedy and I play this seductress vampire,'' said Peck,
who refuses to give her age, saying only ``you know actresses never
answer that question.'' She later got a role in ``Wall Street.''
   She's hoping the starring role in the low-budget ``Torn Apart,''
filmed on location in Israel for under $2 million, will lead to
bigger parts in bigger movies.
   ``I'd like to be on that level of actresses who are being
considered for the good parts,'' Peck said. ``It's been a struggle.
I've worked a lot in theater. I audition and I get close and my
work is good and then someone more famous gets it. So I'm hoping
(`Torn Apart') will help me out.''

<HEAD>The Reality of the Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everyone has heard the story in one form or
another, since everyone has been affected in some way. It is the
story of the variable dollar.
   A person bought a house in 1978 for $50,000, and now the house
has a market value of $100,000. What an investment, the homeowner
says. Or you find that a car worth $5,000 five years ago still
sells for $5,000. What a car!
   You've been duped by the dollar.
   In the case of the house, divide by two, because the 1990
dollar's buying power is only one-half that of the 1978 dollar. The
house is still a $50,000 house. In terms of the 1985 dollar, the
car is worth only $4,135 or so.
   With some degree of inflation always present in the economy, it
is difficult to make year-to-year comparisons of anything
denominated in dollars, such as paychecks, prices, profits and
gross national product.
   Everyone dupes himself to some extent. Uncle Sam, for instance,
has thrown little celebrations every time the gross national
product reaches another trillion dollar level, knowing full well
that he isn't dealing with reality.
   In reality, the buying power of the dollar changes every day,
every week, every month, every year _ and almost always downward.
But perceptions are slower to change; perhaps there is even a
slight reluctance to change.
   While the changes often are small year-to-year, they add up
substantially after several years have passed. Ten years ago, for
instance, the 1980 dollar bought $1.58 worth of goods or services
as measured by the 1990 dollar.
   To determine where you stand financially in 1980 dollars you
must multiply your current dollar amount by 1.58. By doing so you
will find how many 1990 dollars and cents are needed to equal the
buying power of one 1980 dollar.
   If you earned $25,000 in 1980, for example, you would have to
earn $25,000 times 1.58 in 1990, or $39,500, just to avoid losing
ground. Deflating, isn't it? Yes, and worse: It can be terribly
misleading and confusing.
   In geography, for example, teachers often lament that if
students cannot point to the place on the map where they live, they
can't possibly relate to the rest of the world and its peoples.
   In economics, the lament is only slightly different: How can
individuals relate to the economic world and their progress in it
if they can't comprehend that the measuring stick changes every
year?
   Would it make sense to measure snowfalls by a 12-inch stick one
year, and a 9-inch stick another? Or change the value of the quart
or pound, or time races by a 58-second minute, or change the
gradations on a thermometer?
   With such thoughts in mind, Martin Lefkowitz, an economist for
the National Chamber of Commerce Foundation, annually updates an
index for calculating the impact of inflation all the way back to
1965.
   It's a shocker. The index for 1965 is 4.13, meaning you would
have to have $4.13 in 1990 dollars to equal the buying power of
just one 1965 dollar. The index for 1970 isn't much better at 3.36.
   Here are others at five-year intervals from 1990, which is 1.00:
1985, index 1.21; 1980, 1.58; 1975, 2.42. Multiply 1990 dollars
against the index to determine how many 1990 dollars equal $1 in
those years.
   It can be a deflating experience, but isn't it better to face
reality than to live in fantasy?

<TEXT>
   Sidney Lumet has mixed feelings about a lot of
things these days.
   New York City, for instance.
   ``It was a marvelous city in the '50s, '60s, '70s,'' said the
65-year-old filmmaker, a native New Yorker who has earned Academy
Award nominations for such New York-based films as ``Dog Day
Afternoon'' and ``Network.''
   ``I think it's dreadful now; I'm surprised. The fish has gone
belly up. That ethnic camaraderie has gone. It's separate
wolfpacks.''
   And New York cops.
   ``I've always been proud of the New York police force. The
uniforms don't fit, and their hair's too long and they've got a bit
of a belly. Still, they've never lost a hostage in a hostage
situation. They've done some great things.
   ``But now, there's been 12, 14 shootings of blacks in the past
few years. It's never happened before in this city.''
   That ambivalence has been channeled into his films, into such
characters as Treat Williams' disenchanted cop in ``Prince of the
City,'' and Paul Newman's shady lawyer in ``The Verdict.''
   Lumet didn't know how he felt about either character when he
began filming, forming his opinions simply by calling ``print'' at
the completion of a scene. And for his new film, ``Q&amp;A,'' he had
the same mixed feelings about the characters played by stars Nick
Nolte, Timothy Hutton and Armand Assante.
   ``Q&amp;A'' is based on a novel by Edwin Torres, a justice of the
New York State Supreme Court. Nolte stars as Mike Brennan, a
corrupt Irish cop who shoots a Puerto Rican thug and attempts to
cover up the crime.
   Hutton is Al Reilly, a naive assistant prosecutor assigned to
Nolte's case, and Assante plays Bobby Texador, another Puerto Rican
underworld figure murdered by Nolte.
   ``I said at the beginning of rehearsal that if I do this movie
well you're going to feel a kind of sadness when Armand gets blown
up,'' Lumet recalled. ``There's something noble about him.
   ``With Nick's character, he's going on and on and on, and you
think he's the most hateful thing that's ever been. Then, the thing
at the end, when he talks about being a cop, about `our widows,'
and `our orphans.' There's all of those facets.''
   In ``Q&amp;A,'' Lumet offers a bleak vision of New York, depicting a
city that has heard Peter Finch's tormented call to arms in
``Network'' _ ``I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it
anymore'' _ and adopted it as a way of life.
   Lumet presents a fallen rainbow coalition, with racism expressed
in the harshest language or the slightest twitch of the face.
   ``There used to be a celebration of difference,'' Lumet said,
``and that feeling has completely gone. It's profound, and it's not
just New York. I think it's happening all around. One of the
reasons I wanted to make this film is that I sensed this `old boy'
network was all bull.''
   Lumet's mixed feelings even extend to location shooting. It
began in the late 1950s as a necessity, when lack of studio space
forced him outside. Proudly, the director recalled his years of
location work, in ``Dog Day Afternoon,'' ``Serpico'' and the 1965
film ``The Pawnbroker,'' shot entirely in Harlem.
   But while Lumet and crew covered everything from Greenwich
Village to Kennedy Airport for ``Q&amp;A,'' the director admitted that
after years of hitting the streets and never looking back, he now
catches himself peering nervously over his shoulder.
   ``Tim and Nick went out riding in squad cars, riding in
Washington Heights, one of the last integrated neighborhoods in New
York. Nick said to me, `How come you don't go.'
   ``I said I can't do that anymore. I can't stand those domestic
disputes. A cop getting shot or a cop shooting someone. Living like
that, I don't know how the cops do it. It's a very ambivalent
feeling.''
   For Lumet, the blurring of right and wrong has been a mixed
blessing: a feeling of loss over people and places he once revered,
but also a challenge to become more open-minded. The director says
he values forgiveness, in life and film, and always looks for three
dimensions: even with people that exist only on screen.
   ``I think a big part of my own life, and my own concerns have
had a lot to do with judging and not judging people. Rigid behavior
versus behavior that flows with life.
   ``I think it's very Jewish. I'm not a religious person at all
and I had to go to a Seder for Passover. I was reminded how stern
Judaism is. How unforgiving, how tough. You can't get off the hook.
You can't get confession. You can't do nothing. Once you've blown
it, you've blown it.''

<HEAD>Which Number is Best: Raw or Cooked?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political power and billions of dollars are at
stake in a battle over which final census numbers will be better:
the raw or the cooked.
   It's an argument that's been obscured by the early problems
plaguing the census count.
   But a year from now, the question of ``adjusting'' the results
of the census could be the center of a crucial and bitter debate
among the states and cities, in Congress and in the courts.
   ``They can't beat us out, so they want to count us out,'' John
D. Rogers, a Republican floor leader in the Kentucky Senate,
charged in a letter to the Commerce Department.
   Democrats and other advocates for minorities see the refusal to
adjust as a method of disenfranchising their voters.
   New York City Mayor David Dinkins charged that the undercount of
minorities will cost cities hundreds of millions of dollars and
many seats in Congress.
   ``They have gotten away with statistical malfeasance for 200
years and figure they can get away with it for another 10,''
Dinkins said.
   ``A decision against adjustment is a decision against a more
accurate census,'' Javier P. Guajardo, an assistant attorney
general in Texas, wrote the Commerce Department.
   ``A decision against a more accurate census is a decision
against fair representation of the American public, in particular
those who need to be counted most _ minorities, the poor and the
homeless.''
   The sides already are staking out their positions in terms of
language, with opponents referring to adjustment as ``fiddling''
with the numbers, while those in favor prefer the term
``correcting'' the count.
   Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, who heads the House subcommittee
that supervises the census, seems to be leaning toward the idea of
adjustment.
   When the billions are spent and the counting is all done, will
we know how many Americans there are, he was asked.
   ``I hope so, when we add in the known error,'' Sawyer said.
``The question is, will we take that into account.''
   The time, he said, may have come when the nation is just too
large for current methods of counting.
   ``We may be seeing the point where we need to consider more
modern statistical methods to bring the basic numbers closer to the
truth.''
   Why adjust the census?
   Because it isn't perfect.
   The bureau has never claimed it could count everyone.
   In 1980, a bureau analysis estimated that 1.4 percent of the
population was missed. But the error wasn't uniform.
   Most white, middle-class folks got counted, while the poor and
minorities were more likely to be missed. Young black men were
undercounted by as much as 6 percent, officials have estimated.
   A decade ago the decision on adjustment was left to the Census
Bureau. Statisticians there decided they weren't confident enough
in their methods to make changes in the final numbers.
   By 1987, many census workers thought an adjustment could _ and
should _ be made in 1990.
   The Commerce Department stepped in and, in late 1987, ruled that
no adjustment would be made in 1990. The ruling cited statistical
questions and contended that adjustment would erode confidence in
the census.
   Barbara Bailar, who headed the census office studying
adjustment, resigned.
   Some politicians and officials charged the decision was
political, because the minorities who are undercounted are more
likely to be Democrats.
   A group of local governments led by New York City filed suit.
   That suit was settled with a promise by the Commerce Department
to reconsider, but was later reinstated.
   The Commerce Department has set a group of criteria that will be
used to make a decision by July 15, 1991 _ several months after the
numbers have to be delivered to state and local governments for
reapportionment.
   Those criteria, opponents argued in reinstating their lawsuit,
are so stringent that they virtually prohibit adjustment.
   If a decision is eventually made to adjust, it will not be until
mid-1991.
   Because the first census reports will come out Dec. 31, that
means there would be two sets of numbers _ providing easily
identifiable winners and losers.
   The fact that there is a limited amount of money and only 435
seats in the House of Representatives means that every gain by one
state requires a loss by another.
   While the 1990 census will likely mean movement of a dozen or so
House seats from one state to another, the difference between raw
and adjusted numbers should affect only two to four seats, Sawyer
said.
   It will also mean a difference of billions of dollars in federal
and state money distributed over the next 10 years based on
population numbers.
   University of Wisconsin historian Margo Anderson, author of a
book on the history of the census, said ``the framers of the
Constitution knew that the orderly transfer of political
representation is always disruptive to some groups or interests in
society.''
   ``The test of the new methods is not whether they are
disruptive, but whether they are fair,'' she said, adding that the
department's guidelines for adjustment ``conjure up an idealized
history, the notion of a 200-year process of enumeration which
cannot be tampered with.''
   In fact, she noted, census methods have changed radically over
the centuries.
   ``The premise that the actual enumeration is the best count
possible has no factual support,'' John W. Tukey of Princeton
University told the department.
   The Census Bureau launched its effort to count the estimated 250
million Americans in late March, a project expected to take the
rest of the year.
   The tally was embroiled in controversy from the start, with
millions of forms misaddressed.
   The public response was less than the bureau had hoped. The
effort has moved to a door-to-door count, but that will cost
considerably more than if people had all received their forms and
mailed them back.

<HEAD>Efficiency Important in Global Pecking Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No country is ready to knock the United States
from its roost as the world's top poultry producer. But in the
global game of chicken there is a beak-to-beak race to see who is
the most efficient.
   Efficiency can translate into profits for producers and lower
prices for consumers. Efficiency also is a big factor in one
country's having an export advantage over another.
   The world's poultry trade is one of the many items under
discussion in the current Uruguay Round of negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is scheduled to
conclude by the end of this year.
   According to Agriculture Department analysts, the GATT talks _
which are aimed at general liberalization of world trade _ could
lead to greater traffic in poultry meat and lower consumer prices
in many countries.
   Basically, the department's Economic Research Service says in a
recent report, efficient producers such as the United States,
Thailand and Brazil would reap benefits from successful GATT
negotiations.
   ``Poultry is the fastest growing source of meat, representing
about 22 percent of all meat production in 1988,'' the report said.
``The countries with industrial market economies accounted for
about 54 percent of total world poultry production and 59 percent
of world exports in 1988.''
   The five major poultry importers in 1988 were Japan, Saudi
Arabia, the Soviet Union, Hong Kong and Iraq. The five biggest
exporters were the United States, the European Economic Community,
Brazil, Hungary and Thailand.
   ``Poultry's relative share of total meat consumption after trade
liberalization would probably continue to grow because costs of
poultry production could continue to be lower than for other
meats,'' the report said.
   The United States produced about 20.7 billion pounds of poultry
in 1988, based on estimated ready-to-cook weight. That was almost
double the output of 1970. Broilers make up most poultry.
   In 1940, U.S. broilers _ once called fryers _ required more than
4 pounds of feed for each pound of live weight gain. Today, the
ratio is about 2 pounds of feed for each 1 of gain.
   Moreover, the report said, improved genetic stock and management
have reduced the time to ``grow out'' a broiler from 14 weeks in
1940 to 6 or 7 weeks currently.
   Consequently, based on 1986 figures, U.S. broiler producers are
able to turn out ready-to-cook birds for an average cost of 29.9
cents per pound.
   Given the great size of the overall U.S. chicken factory, that
should rank American producers at the top of the heap for
efficiency. Collectively, the No. 2 producer, including chickens
consumed domestically and those exported, was the EEC, which
produced 13 billion pounds in 1988.
   The Soviet Union was third at 7.02 billion pounds, followed by
China, 5.29 billion; Brazil, 4.4 billion; Japan, 3.24 billion; and
France, the leading EEC producer, 3.16 billion.
   Feed conversion rates and costs of production were not available
to agency researchers for the EEC, although the 1986 cost of
production of broilers in France was 34.8 cents per pound.
   In the Soviet Union, the third-ranked broiler producer, it
required 3.6 pounds of feed to grow 1 pound of broiler, compared
with 5.3 pounds in 1965. No costs were shown. Also, it takes a
Soviet chicken 66 to 77 days to grow enough to be eaten, more than
40 percent longer than the U.S. broiler.
   ``Much of the differential between Soviet producers and
producers in other countries can probably be attributed to the low
protein content of Soviet poultry feed, because most protein meal
must be imported,'' the report said.
   But U.S. broiler efficiency is being challenged by some other
countries. Thailand, a relative newcomer to broiler production,
turns out birds at a cost of 29.9 cents per pound of ready-to-cook
weight, matching the U.S. cost. Feed conversion also is at the U.S.
rate of 2 pounds of feed for each pound of live weight.
   New Zealand is producing broilers with 1.9 pounds of feed for
each pound of growth, but its costs were reported at 33.6 cents per
ready-to-cook pound.
   The report showed that consumer broiler prices in the United
States in November 1988 averaged 85 cents per pound. Only Brazil
was lower at 68 cents.
   Others included in a selected list of prices for broiler meat in
capital cities in U.S. dollars, included Australia, $1.69 per
pound; Canada, $1.24; France, $2.22; Japan, $2.90, and Mexico, 93
cents.

<HEAD>End of Cold War, Philippine Nationalism May Cause Bases To Close</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 25th `In Vietnam' with more on Soviet
forces; picks up 26th `Regional governments'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fading Cold War and growing
Philippine nationalism may cause the United States to close its
oldest and largest military bases on foreign soil.
   American and Philippine officials open talks Monday on whether
the United States will be allowed access to Clark Air Base, the
Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations after Sept. 16,
1991, when the 1947 Military Bases Agreement expires.
   Because the bases have been the cornerstone of American defense
of the Far East, the outcome of the talks will be a central element
in defining the future U.S. role in East Asia.
   A new long-term agreement is far from certain.
   Soviet military retrenchment has led to demands in the U.S.
Congress that the expensive network of foreign bases be trimmed.
   Filipinos question whether they can be truly independent while
40,000 American service personnel, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents remain on their soil.
   President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether she supports
an extension of the agreement. U.S. diplomats and government
sources say they believe she favors it, but has avoided a public
commitment because the issue is so sensitive.
   Most Filipino politicians who have commented publicly want the
bases closed next year or phased out by the end of the century.
   Opposition stiffened after Congress cut $96 million from an aid
package the Reagan administration had promised Manila in order to
keep the bases until the agreement expired.
   Since the end of World War II, Filipinos assumed the United
States wanted to keep the bases at all costs and would pay
handsomely for the privilege.
   In 1988, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus demanded $2 billion in
aid, but eventually accepted a two-year package of $962 million
   Congressional pressure to reduce defense spending as the Soviet
threat recedes has raised doubts that the bases are worth such a
price.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has announced plans to reduce the
120,000 U.S. troops in the Far East by 10 to 12 percent over three
years as the newly prosperous nations of Asia assume greater
responsibility for their own defense.
   ``My sense is that, if it looks too testy, the United States
will simply tell the Philippines that we will close down,'' Paul H.
Kreisberg of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said
about the negotiations.
   U.S. policymakers and private researchers believe the bases
still have an important role in projecting American military power
and maintaining security in the Far East.
   The American military has been in the Philippines since 1898,
when the United States seized the archipelago in the
Spanish-American war, ending 350 years of Spanish rule.
   It has larger forces elsewhere in Asia _ 64,000 troops in Japan
and 43,000 in South Korea _ but the Philippine bases allow the
United States great flexibility in crises, including those far from
Pacific waters.
   NATO agreements prohibit the United States from using its
European-based forces outside the alliance area without allied
permission.
   No such restrictions apply in the Philippines.
   Three-quarters of the U.S. warships that escorted oil tankers
through the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War were from the
Pacific Fleet. Most were supplied and outfitted at Subic, 50 miles
west of Manila.
   Planes from Clark and the Cubi Point naval air station monitor
shipping lanes and supply the large Indian Ocean air and naval
installations at Diego Garcia.
   ``In a straight military sense, the value of the bases declines
only slightly in a post-Cold War era,'' said Richard Fisher, a
Heritage Foundation policy analyst. ``There will still be a
requirement to deploy to South Korea or potential conflicts in the
Persian Gulf.''
   Some functions could be performed on Guam, Saipan and Tinian,
more than 1,500 miles east, but experts say the Guam harbor is far
smaller than Subic's. The islands also lack the skilled labor,
especially ship repairmen, available in the Philippines.
   Despite official opposition to foreign forces, most East Asian
governments privately support the bases. Fidel Ramos, the
Philippine defense secretary, said there was little evidence of a
major reductions in Soviet forces in Vietnam or in Vladivostok,
headquarters of the Soviet Pacific fleet.
   In Vietnam, the Soviet navy uses the U.S.-built base at Cam Ranh
Bay.
   The Soviets said in January they had reduced air strength at Cam
Ranh Bay to no more than 10 planes. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach of Vietnam says all Soviet forces will be gone by 1992.
   In recent years, U.S. officials have played down the Soviet
presence as the reason for maintaining bases Philippine bases.
   Brent Scowcroft, now President Bush's national security adviser,
told a news conference two years ago that trading Cam Ranh Bay for
Subic ``would be very much in the Soviet interest, but not
necessarily in ours. ... The Russians don't need (it) nearly as
much as we do the Philippines.''
   Regional governments fear a drastic reduction in U.S. forces
would cause such nations as China, Japan, Vietnam and India to
expand their forces.
   ``Without a persuasive U.S. presence, there will be a power
vacuum which other powers would scramble to fill,'' said Lee Hsien
Loong, Singapore's deputy defense minister.
   Such geopolitical concerns mean less than money and national
pride in the introspective Philippines.
   Most surveys indicate supporters of the bases outnumber
opponents, but Filipinos in growing numbers believe the American
presence infringes national sovereignty.
   The installations pump an estimated $1 billion into the economy,
however, and more than 270,000 Filipinos depend on them for a
livelihood.
   ``Those people who say we have alternatives to the bases have to
prove they can replace the considerable support given by the U.S.
facilities to the city,'' said Mayor Richard Gordon of Olongapo,
home of the Subic base.
   Opposition to the bases stems from complex, often-contradictory
views of the United States, which ruled the Philippines from 1898
to 1946.
   Admiration of American culture borders on obsession among
Filipinos, the most westernized Asians, but many believe this has
created a psychological dependence that inhibits national
development.
   The Philippine military relies almost entirely on the United
States for external defense. Its navy often turns to the Americans
for help in air and sea rescues. U.S. Air Force meteorologists warn
their Filipino counterparts of approaching typhoons.
   On the other side, critics claim the bases encourage
prostitution. The sleazy bars and nightclubs of Olongapo and
Angeles, home of Clark Air Base, serve as evidence.
   ``The whole bases campaign is a quest for finding out who we
are,'' said Socorro Diokno, chairman of the Anti-Bases Coalition.
``Can the Filipino stand on his feet without having to rely on
America?''
   Dependence on the United States was dramatized in December when
American F-4 Phantom jets from Clark flew air cover for government
forces during a coup attempt.
   The planes never fired a shot, but their presence stopped rebel
air attacks on military and government buildings, including the
presidential palace.
   Last year, Mrs. Aquino appointed a committee to study
alternative uses for the bases if no new agreement was reached.
Proposals include converting Clark to a civilian airport and
establishing a commercial ship repair facility at Subic.
   Businessmen in Olongapo and Angeles are skeptical.
   ``We firmly believe that any conversion plan regarding
alternative uses of the bases entails huge costs and implementation
is doubtful,'' the Angeles Chamber of Commerce and Industry in a
statement.

<HEAD>Rich-Poor Gap, Economic Crisis Spur Crime Wave in Rio</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside the luxury hotel was a
conference on ``Tourism and Crime in Rio.'' Just outside, two
tourists were mugged.
   Men with shotguns hold up airport buses. Valuables are stolen at
the beach, from hotel rooms.
   Police booths sprout in every block. Cariocas, as Rio's
residents are called, have special devices on their cars that cut
off the fuel supply when a thief has driven a few blocks.
   Crime always has infested Rio's slums, but now it is common on
the glitzy tourist beaches and the streets where money lives.
   Cariocas have little affinity for the police or justice system
and often settle disputes themselves. Increasingly, guns are the
arbiters of choice.
   Not long ago, Antonio Enrique de Oliveira sighted down the
barrel of his new .38-caliber pistol and squeezed off a shot.
   ``That's my law,'' the husky, 26-year-old mechanic said as the
report echoed off the hills overlooking the vast, poor suburb of
Nova Iguacu. ``It's the only law that works in Rio anymore.''
   Death squads, generally off-duty policemen fed up with the
inefficient courts and turnstile justice, make another kind of law.
They simply kill known criminals or suspects, often for pay from
merchants.
   Among reasons for the crime wave are poverty, rarity of
punishment, the example of official corruption, inflation that
reached nearly 5,000 percent and forced harsh economic measures,
and an ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
   The top 1 percent of Brazil's 150 million people have as much
wealth as the bottom 50 percent.
   Police statistics say homicides in metropolitain Rio rose from
2,924 in 1983 to 7,654 last year.
   Residents and religious leaders say most killings don't get into
the records. A city police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there were nearly 20,000 in metropolitan Rio last
year.
   ``Crime has never been this bad. We're fighting a guerrilla
war,'' said Helio Vigio, a police inspector for 20 years.
   A sociologist, Helio Jaguaribe, said: ``The elite and the
establishment can no longer control tensions between rich and poor.
Crime is now seen by the poor as social retribution.''
   Gun sales icreased from 15,520 in 1987 to 22,872 in 1989.
Cariocas bar their windows, and buy burglar alarms and watch dogs.
Neighbors often band together to hire armed guards.
   ``My sales are doubling every three months,'' said Mauro Cesar
Martins, who displays eight models of .38 caliber revolvers in his
downtown sporting goods store. ``People trust only their gun for
protection. Can you blame them?''
   Police say thousands of automatic weapons smuggled from Paraguay
and Bolivia are bought and sold in illegal gun markets.
   For years, violent crime was largely confined to Rio's North
Zone, a poor, densely populated area far from the beaches of the
wealthy South Zone.
   Automatic weapons abound in the North Zone. Gang wars end in
massacres.
   Citizens carry pistols in their shorts. Children as young as 5
run cocaine to customers in affluent neighborhoods.
   Bodies are dumped in the streets every day, sometimes outside
police stations. One Sunday in January, 10 were found in a group,
shot through the head. A month later, a record 57 corpses turned up
in Rio in a single weekend.
   Gang leaders establish personal fiefdoms in the ``favelas,'' or
hillside shantytowns, and organize residents into defense units.
   ``The slums are becoming armed fortresses of urban warfare,''
said Lt. Eide Trindade, director of Rio's task force on organized
crime.
   ``On drug raids in the hills, you run into nests of machine
gunners. When they open fire, it's like walking into lightning.''
   City police, poorly equipped, trained and paid, are no match for
the well-armed criminals. They are sent into the streets without
nightsticks, holsters or bulletproof vests, and must buy their own
uniforms.
   Each officer is given six bullets every three months. They
patrol in 13-year-old Volkswagen Beetles, which often have broken
radios.
   Rio has 12,000 municipal police and 27,000 state police in a
metropolitan area of 10.5 million people.
   Death squads, which first appeared in the 1950s, are growing
with the crime wave. Community leaders say they have more than
2,000 members, compared with 500 two years ago.
   A police inquiry made public in April said the chiefs of 15
death squads in greater Rio were active state policemen.
   ``The death squads are in complete control of the people; if
anyone sees a murder and opens his mouth, he's as good as dead,''
said Azuleika Rodrigues, president of the Federation of
Neighborhood Associations in Nova Iguacu.
   Low pay causes police strikes and corruption. A rookie cop earns
the equivalent of $100 a month and a top-ranking inspector $335.
   ``You have to be a part-time crook or mobster to eat or have
your teeth fixed,'' said officer Jose Quimonte, 33, who works 48
hours a week for $188.
   There is temptation for officers to break the law, and little
incentive for them to enforce it.
   Police say lawbreakers are encouraged by a slow, understaffed
judicial system and the belief that criminals will get light
sentences or go free.
   ``If you bring someone in, chances are that, if he's rich
enough, hid salespeople from The World's No. 1 Jewelry Company
Serving The Sanitation Industry. The idea _ clear Hefty Cinch-Saks
_ might seem a trifle mundane. But last month's Earth Day somehow
has Americans excited about a mundane task _ throwing out trash.

   The Marapicu cemetery in the impoverished
Baixada Fluminense suburbs of Rio de Janeiro has been a burial
ground for victims of death squads for nearly 30 years. Police
officials admit knowing this, but have neither undertaken an
investigation nor explained their failure to do so. Todd Lewan
visited the graveyard.

<TEXT>
   The dead have no names in Marapicu
cemetery.
   No one knows who they were or where they came from. Death squads
killed them. That is all anyone remembers.
   Sebastiao Fernandez da Rocha, a sparrow-like man of 72, buries
them. At first, it made him sad to think he was the last to see the
victims. He was gentle in lowering the younger ones.
   After 17 years, pity no longer hangs on his features. He is a
gaunt old man with thick calluses raised by the hoe and shovel. The
bodies mean little more to him now than the dirt he throws over
them.
   Each morning, before dawn, Rocha begins a two-hour walk to work,
on a winding road through one of Brazil's most lawless regions, the
Baixada Fluminense.
   Orange groves and cotton once flourished in the Baixada's
lowlands, but the the plantations were divided into plots 30 years
ago and sold to squatters. poverty is everywhere. Machine guns make
the law. Death is judgment.
   When Rocha arrives in Queimados, which means Burned Ones, he
whistles into the open doors of the shacks of two young helpers.
They walk up the red dirt road together to the cemetery on the hill.
   So close are the graves that they nearly touch. Hundreds of
white stone crosses, bearing painted numbers, jut crookedly from
the rocky ground. There are no headstones.
   The task on this morning, presuming death squads attacked again
in the night, was to dig six graves. When that was done, Rocha and
the young men sat in the shade, painting crosses white while they
waited.
   In the heat of the midday sun, a dust cloud rose on the ridge. A
morgue van rolled up. Rocha put on his straw hat and went to it.
The barefoot youths followed.
   ``Lots of meat today,'' said the driver, a big, sweaty man. He
threw the rear doors open.
   Inside were the bodies of eight men and a small girl, in a sun
dress, who had been shot in the stomach. Some of the men's faces
were unrecognizable, nearly blown away.
   Rocha went into a small office near the gate, wrote the number 9
in a ledger and returned. They pulled the corpses out like sacks of
beans and dropped them into plywood boxes. The boxes keep wild dogs
from digging bodies up.
   The young men carried the boxes down the slope while Rocha dug
three more holes.
   Fifty yards away was a single grave with flowers blooming on it.
   ``That's my son,'' Rocha said. ``I found his body about 10
minutes' walk from here on my way in one morning. They broke his
neck and spine. Don't know why. No one ever finds out why they
die.''
   Rocha thrust the shovel into the earth. He was wheezing, ribs
pressing against a torn blue shirt.
   ``He was 15,'' the old man said. ``His name was Luis. Luis
Enrique.''
   He and the others worked quickly, silently, to cover the graves.
Only the rasp of their hoes on the crude coffins interfered with
the sound of a rising wind.
   When it was done, they went out through the black gates and sat
under a mango tree on a bluff, drinking rum from tin cups.
   ``Will there be more today, old man?'' one of the young ones
asked.
   ``Yes.''
   ``It is terrible, isn't it?''
   Rocha grunted. ``This is the way things are,'' he said. ``I
remember a proverb: The blame lies not only with the ax, but the
tree as well. Yes, that is the proverb.''
   The young men nodded and had another pull of rum.

<DATELINE>MOUNT ST. HELENS, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years. Time enough for a
forest to spring from lifeless ash. Time enough for people in the
shadow of a restless volcano to recover, even profit, from
catastrophe.
   But never time enough to forget.
   Even as nature heals this shattered mountain with a blanket of
green, the violence of May 18, 1980, remains seared in memory. That
was the day Mount St. Helens exploded, killing 57 people,
flattening a forest and spitting out an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   Don McElwain remembers. He was camping 20 miles away when hot
ash engulfed him, turning his day to night.
   ``I'm a former Army Ranger and not much scares me,'' he said.
``But I'll tell you, I was doing some praying.''
   McElwain and two camping partners barely escaped on horseback,
breathing through rags torn from their shirts as they rode across
ash that singed the hair on the horses' legs.
   But the ordeal did not destroy his love of Mount St. Helens.
Like many of the volcano's neighbors, McElwain, 53, hopes to profit
from a disaster that changed this region's economic life as surely
as it rearranged the landscape. He's been scouting out land,
thinking of starting up a small tourist resort.
   ``Someday,'' he said, ``this place will be beautiful again.''
   Before it erupted, Mount St. Helens was a snowy, symmetrical,
seemingly dormant volcano surrounded by tall evergreen forests.
Thousands of campers experienced their first real wilderness along
crystal-clear Spirit Lake, on the mountain's north side.
   The idyll couldn't last. Mount St. Helens, historically one of
the Cascade Range's most active volcanoes, had not erupted since
1857. Geologists warned it was overdue.
   At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, after weeks of sputtering and
rumbling, the volcano roared awake. An earthquake jarred loose a
huge slab that slid into the lake, weakening the mountain's north
side.
   Magma that for months had risen slowly up the volcano's vents
suddenly let loose in a sideways explosion of gas, rock and ash
2,500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima.
   A super-heated cloud of pulverized rock, focused horizontally by
the misshapen crater, flattened 150-foot-tall fir trees like pieces
of straw. Across Spirit Lake, a mammoth wave caused by the
landslide sloshed over the opposite ridge, washing the slopes bare
of the downed timber.
   Victims caught in the blast included U.S. Geological Survey
scientist David Johnston, killed even as he monitored delicate
measuring devices on a ridge 5 miles away. Photographer Reid
Blackburn snapped a few pictures, then retreated to his car. He was
found two days later, smothered by ash.
   Harry Truman, who had lived on the mountain 54 years, defied
orders to leave his Spirit Lake lodge, declaring, ``That mountain
is a part of Truman, and I'm a part of it.''
   His words were prophetic. Truman and his lodge were buried under
120 feet of debris and 180 feet of the new, deeper Spirit Lake, a
steaming cauldron of mud and water covered by a floating layer of
uprooted trees scoured of bark.
   The volcano's heat melted glaciers and starting surging
mudflows. One wall of mud 12 feet high swept down the Toutle River,
destroying trucks, bridges and more than 200 homes.
   An ash plume rose 14 miles into the air and drifted eastward,
darkening three states and choking towns with ashfalls up to 6
inches deep.
   To observers first returning to the mountain, the destruction
seemed complete. But as weeks went by, scientists watched in
amazement as life appeared amid the ruin.
   Pocket gophers burrowed up from their tunnels, poking their
heads through ash. Colonies of ants went busily about their
business. Even the most barren areas were soon invaded by
ballooning spiders and beetles, scavengers that floated in on
parachute-like webs and survived on the remains of other insects
blown their way.
   The first summer, green shoots of fireweed and huckleberry rose
through 10-inch layers of ash. Later, elk and deer wandered back,
and the windblown seeds of alders and evergreens sprouted in
fertile patches where water and wind had eroded the ash.
   Inside the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a
110,000-acre preserve created in 1982 for watching natural
regeneration, the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall.
Outside the monument, the U.S. Forest Service and logging companies
gave nature a jump start, salvaging downed trees and planting
seedlings in holes bored through ash. Today, some of those trees
stand 25 feet tall.
   As nature heals, so do people. After the eruption, communities
still grieving for victims started crawling out and slowly cleaning
up.
   Fearing more floods, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged rivers,
built levees and bored a drainage tunnel to Spirit Lake. This May
19, officials will dedicate a sediment retention dam on the Toutle
River, finishing a decade of recovery work costing more than $560
million.
   Muddy rivers have grown clearer, and many residents now look to
St. Helens in hope, not fear. They're staking their futures on the
flood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in the
contiguous United States.
   More than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints or
stop at a Forest Service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano.
Almost 50,000 have climbed the volcano's south side since entry
restrictions were eased in 1987.
   Roadside gift shops specialize in volcano souvenirs, and the
once-flooded town of Toutle sponsors an annual Volcano Daze
Festival. Developers are preparing for 1992, when a highway will be
extended to a new visitor's center peering into the volcano's
crater.
   On sunny spring weekends, the mountain's southern flank becomes
a playground for up to 400 climbers and skiers. There are higher
Northwest mountains for climbing, more accessible mountains for
skiing. But Mount St. Helens, its former 9,677-foot summit reduced
1,300 feet by the eruption, has a magnetic appeal.
   ``I think it's a morbid curiosity,'' said Martha Miller, peering
into the barren crater from the rim after a grueling, six-hour
climb on skis.
   ``It's the mystique,'' said her husband, Ben, who skied the
volcano partly to impress friends back home in New Hampshire, where
the mountains are more sedate. ``St. Helens is an an active
volcano, and everyone's heard of it.''
   Ten years is a blink of an eye in geologic time, and the volcano
still sputters. The latest steam release occurred April 25.
   Scientists don't rule out more fireworks but say the possibility
of an eruption is low. A 920-foot lava dome on the crater floor has
not grown since 1986, and geologists, who have honed their
predictive skills since 1980, are confident they can give days or
weeks notice of significant eruptions.
   That's scant reassurance at the volcano rim, where the
mountain's jagged wounds are still raw, its destructive power still
overwhelming. Silent fields of snow and towers of rock dwarfed the
skiers as they stared into the immense crater.
   Ten years later, Mount St. Helens still commands respect.
   ``It makes you feel pretty small,'' Martha Miller said. She
turned her back to a chill wind blowing up from the crater, and the
skiers headed down to the springtime warmth of the forest, far
below.

<TEXT>
   Tom Kadlec had just left church May 18,
1980 when the black clouds began rolling in. He doesn't remember if
the pastor preached fire and brimstone that Sunday morning. If he
did, it was fitting.
   ``About 3:30 in the afternoon it turned blackest dark, and the
automatic street lights came on like the world was coming to an
end,'' Kadlec said. ``We were all wondering what was happening.''
   What happened was something residents of this farming town of
1,800 never want to experience again. Mount St. Helens, roughly 200
miles to the southwest, blew its top at 8:32 a.m. Within hours,
tons of wind-carried volcanic ash and dust were being dumped on the
eastern Washington towns of Ellensburg, Yakima, Moses Lake and
Ritzville.
   ``I didn't hear any explosions or anything,'' recalled Terry
Reed, owner of the 21-room Empire Motel. ``A little later on in the
afternoon, people started coming in and saying, `We want to get in
here and get a room before it hits.' And I said, `What hits?' Well,
I found out.''
   Overnight, Ritzville's population more than doubled. The five
motels in town filled up within hours as roughly 2,200 stranded
travelers abandoned their ash-clogged cars on roads and highways.
Homes, schools and churches served as emergency shelters. The mail
stopped, businesses closed and the city's vibrantly blooming
hawthorn trees sagged and died.
   By Monday morning, 4 to 7 inches of pale gray ash blanketed Main
Street, family wheat fields, the golf course. Drug stores had a run
on dust masks. Grocery stores and restaurants ran out of supplies
and food.
   ``It got so bad the mayor had to close the bars down, people got
to fighting and stealing from one another,'' Reed said.
   For three days, nobody could get into town, or out.
   ``All this ash was everywhere, and it was just quiet. There
wasn't a bird or anything, no sounds at all. It was just eerie,
eerie,'' said Diane Keetch, co-owner of Colwell Motor Inn.
   Kirk Danekas, a funeral home operator who was mayor at the time,
postponed a funeral scheduled for Monday. He trudged up a hill by
the cemetery and looked forlornly down on the heart of the city he
had governed for less than a year and a half.
   ``And there was this great gray mass. And I asked myself, are
all these people going to leave? Is this the end of the town?''
   It wasn't, of course. Nearer the volcano, 57 people were killed,
many by the scorching blast of the eruption or the smothering ash.
But few serious health problems or emergencies were reported here.
   More than anything, the tons of ash were an enormous mess.
   In the weeks that followed, the town dug out. Danekas said 36 of
39 counties sent equipment or other aid. Homeowners cleaned their
roofs and yards and piled the ash along the street. Water trucks
hosed it down. Earth moving machinery pushed it into piles.
Scoop-loaders picked up hundreds of cubic yards of ash and dumped
it in a gravel pit a quarter mile from town.
   ``It was just hard work for everybody,'' Danekas said.
   The abrasive ash wore out farm machinery but didn't seem to
poison any crops. In fact, many wheat farmers suggested the ash was
the reason for a bumper crop that year.
   ``When it rained, the ash seemed to seal the moisture,'' said
Mike Bauer, adding that his crop was 20 percent above average that
year.
   To this day, the ash remains in Bauer's soil, compressed in a
quarter-inch layer. A whitish-gray film can also be seen along
roadsides and undisturbed hillsides.
   And reminders of the fallout a decade ago will long rest in the
hearts and minds of people like Janet Sanger of neighboring Lind, a
town that beckons visitors with a sign that says: ``Drop in. Mount
St. Helens did.''
   ``It was amazing,'' she said. ``I hope I never live through
anything like that again.''

<HEAD>Ash Makes Everything From Gems to Jesus</HEAD>

   Entrepreneurs have turned the ash from
Mount St. Helens into everything from gemstones to Jesus in the
last decade, and volcano kitsch still is a hot seller.
   Ash is Washington state's answer to the velvet Elvises and straw
cowboy hats that lure tourist dollars in other areas.
   When Sally Warren surveyed the ruined cucumbers in her Woodland
garden that May day in 1980, she never imagined Mount St. Helen's
ash would one day put money in her pocket.
   But 10 years after the eruption, Ms. Warren and a partner
continue to make and sell porcelain figures containing some of the
ash. It is one of several businesses born of the volcano.
   ``A little economy has definitely developed and grown from using
this Mount St. Helen's ash,'' said Mary Mains, whose company makes
jewelry from it.
   Inventive residents put the ash in everything from pottery to
earrings to Christmas ornaments, paperweights and pens. There are
even ash-colored volcanoes with little ash smoke plumes coming out
the top.
   They sell to tourists and to Washington residents seeking gifts
for out-of-state friends, said Kay Thomas, owner of a gift shop in
this city about 100 miles east of the volcano. The lure is the
volcano connection.
   ``I wish I had known you could do wonderful things with it,''
Ms. Thomas said of the ash that piled up on her roof. ``I would
have sold it.''
   Other people immediately saw the potential. Workers who went up
the mountain to salvage the engines of destroyed logging trucks
learned their cutting torches would melt the ash into a green stone.
   That discovery prompted Ms. Mains to found a new branch of her
retail business, The Emerald Fox.
   She keeps five employees busy producing ``Emerald Obsidianite''
jewelry made by melting the ash at 2,700 degrees in an oxygen-free
environment. The jewelry is sold over the United States, she said.
   The ash is not actually ash, but rock dust that is largely
composed of silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium and at least
12 other elements, she said.
   Chromium and iron, when heated, give the stone its rich green
color, making it a dead ringer for emeralds, she said. They are so
close in appearance that New York City jewelry stories, concerned
about security, use the stones in window displays as a substitute
for emeralds.
   The jewelry, priced from $30 to more than $200, may indeed
attract buyers because of its beauty.
   The same cannot be said for the $2 pens whose plastic bodies are
filed with ash. Or what looks like a clump of wet sand in the form
of a tiny smoldering volcano. Only hard-core ash enthusiasts could
love those.
   And all ash is not created equal.
   The debris from different eruptions came from different depths
of the Earth and reacts differently to processing.
   Ms. Warren and partner Fay Miller make their porcelain figures
with ash gathered from the June 12, 1980, eruption, rather than the
May eruption.
   ``It's more like sand,'' she said. ``The first eruption was more
like talcum powder. It made it look muddy.''
   Ms. Mains disdains the 1980 ash altogether, preferring for her
jewelry a 1981 vintage believed to have come from 10 to 20 miles
below the Earth's surface.
   Fred Ybarra, a gemologist in Yakima, said many people still come
into his shop offering to sell their ash. He can't use it but said
that items made from ash would eventually become more valuable as
the ash supply runs out.
   Ms. Warren uses about 2 tablespoons of ash for every gallon of
porcelain she mixes up. Her husband shoveled up a large amount of
ash shortly after the eruptions, and they keep it in gallon jars at
their home.
   ``We've got enough for another 40 years,'' she said.

<HEAD>Decorated Soldier Returns from Self-Imposed Exile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL BASKERVILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's most decorated soldiers
has ended nearly two decades of self-imposed exile to fight for
reform of a military establishment that he says lacks the moral
courage to change.
   Col. David H. Hackworth broke with the Army in 1971,
disillusioned and angered by its use of conventional tactics to
fight a guerrilla war in Vietnam.
   Forced to retire from the service because of his public
criticism of the Vietnam strategy, an embittered Hackworth built a
a new life in Australia. It took 18 years before he put the
bitterness behind him and returned to the United States.
   ``I was angry; I was vindictive,'' said Hackworth, author of the
1989 best-selling autobiography ``About Face.''
   ``Writing the book was an incredible catharsis for me. I was
able to heal myself.''
   Now he is directing his energy toward a campaign to reshape a
military bureaucracy that he says must ``change its mind-set and
come up with fresh ideas.''
   Hackworth said he is pressing for the merger of the Army, Navy
and Air Force into an American Defense Force. He says the change
would reduce waste and duplication and provide for a more
streamlined command system.
   ``Our military is all wrong, has been all wrong since World War
II,'' he said. The key to change is ``getting warrior leaders at
the top, rather than manager-careerists,'' Hackworth said.
   ``All we need is leadership _ people who've got the guts,
determination and the vision to turn things around, instead of
those who live by the motto of `go along to get along.'''
   It's imperative that Congress and the Pentagon make reforms
because ``the American people are tired of being ripped off,'' said
Hackworth, who will make his case in a May 14 meeting with Army
Secretary Michael Stone.
   Maj. Joe Pidilla, an Army spokesman, declined to comment on
Hackworth's statements.
   Orphaned before he was a year old, Hackworth, 59, was raised in
California by his grandmother and in foster homes.
   He lied about his age to join the Army in 1946 when he was 15
and received a battlefield commission in Korea five years later. At
40 he became the youngest full colonel in Vietnam, where he served
for nearly six years.
   His many awards for valor include two Distinguished Service
Crosses, nine Silver Stars, eight Bronze Stars, and eight Purple
Hearts for wounds suffered in battle.
   Hackworth gained a reputation for blunt talk when, as a teen-age
private in Italy, he told Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, ``The chow
stinks.''
   His unsparing criticism of tactics and doctrine continued
throughout his 25-year career. It culminated in 1971 when he
appeared on ABC's ``Issues and Answers'' show. He told a national
television audience that the Army's Vietnam tactics were not unlike
the food he had in Italy.
   That was too much for the Army, which unceremoniously retired
the man who had been told a few months earlier that he was
virtually assured promotion to brigadier general.
   ``I was brokenhearted because the Army was my family,'' he said.
``I loved it.''
   Hackworth said he chose Australia as a new home because it was
the farthest place from the United States where English was spoken.
He bought a diner and two gas stations and later purchased a
restaurant in Brisbane. He sold the restaurant a few years later
for $1 million and took up farming.
   Hackworth decided to reconcile with his country during a May
1988 visit to turn in the manuscript of ``About Face'' to his
publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. It was then he realized that
``writing the book had driven the devil out of me.''
   Last year he bought a home in Montana, where he will live about
six months a year. The rest of the time he'll spend at his home in
Australia.
   A major focus of his campaign for military reform has been the
Vietnam War, from which the military has learned little, he said.
   ``We haven't conducted an honest postmortem. We are treating it
exactly as we treated Korea. We were so humiliated by not winning
in Korea that we took all the mistakes and swept them under the
rug. Vietnam became the stepchild of the Korean War.''
   Hackworth cautioned against reckless dismemberment of the
military as the Soviet threat diminishes.
   ``We did it in 1918, 1945, 1953 and 1973. We went into World War
II not prepared; we went into Korea not prepared.''
   ``The contraction of the military has to be done carefully,'' he
said. ``What I would do is have a moratorium on the acquisition of
any goodies. We wouldn't buy any Stealths, we wouldn't buy any
Midgetman'' missiles.
   ``We should use the money to keep our military personnel and
build down through attrition,'' he said.
   ``If there's one lesson we learned in Vietnam it was that
hardware couldn't win over dedicated men. One thing the Viet Cong
had _ just like our revolutionary forefathers who beat a superior
force in the field _ was fire in their bellies. Men win wars, not
hardware.''
   He also urged a return to the draft because ``a standing
volunteer Army violates what our country is about. It becomes
isolated from the values of our society. ...
   ``Our young people are couch potatoes. They're weak and their
moral values are bad. At least the military can give them values.''

   OPEC ministers agreed to cut the cartel's total
crude output by 1.45 million barrels a day from April production of
23.5 million in an effort to help maintain oil prices at a minimum
of $18 a barrel.
   But oil prices fell sharply after Thursday's announcement amid
skepticism that the cut would actually materialize. Analysts noted
that even if OPEC succeeds, the action wouldn't be enough to solve
the current oil glut.

   Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks edged up 2.8 percent in late April as rising sales of
``transplant'' cars from foreign-owned factories helped overcome a
sharp sales drop at Chrysler Corp.
   North American-made cars and trucks sold at an average rate of
47,684 during the period, up 2.8 percent, while the average rate
for Big Three vehicles was 41,543, up just 0.1 percent, the
companies reported Thursday.
   Chrysler said its car sales in the April 21-30 period dropped
33.8 percent and light truck sales dropped 16.5 percent from that
period a year earlier. Increases at General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. barely offset the declines.

   Profits fell by 54 percent at General Motors
Corp. and by 69 percent at Ford Motor Co. in the first quarter due
to U.S. production slowdowns and problems with overseas operations.
   The figures released Thursday, combined with Chrysler Corp.'s 80
percent drop in first quarter net income, meant an overall 64
percent profit drop for the Big Three automakers during the period.
   But the results were not as bad as the 75 percent profit decline
that analysts had expected for the companies, which are struggling
with soft markets and intensified competition from foreign-based
automakers.

   A federal appeals court decision striking down a
key insider trading rule deals a sharp blow to enforcement of Wall
Street's crime of the 1980s, lawyers say.
   The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
also renewed calls for Congress to pass a law precisely defining
insider trading, which refers to the use of information not
publicly available to buy and sell securities.
   ``This should put a little bit of fear into people who want to
see a very strong enforcement program,'' Harvey L. Pitt, a top
securities lawyer who helped draft failed 1987 insider trading
legislation, said Thursday.
   ``It demonstrates again why the (Securities and Exchange
Commission) would be better off if they had a definition of insider
trading that was blessed by the Congress,'' said Pitt, who
represented Ivan Boesky, the speculator who settled insider trading
charges in 1987.
   The appeals court Wednesday overturned the conviction of former
stockbroker Robert Chestman, found guilty of insider trading using
fourth-hand information about the pending takeover of a supermarket
chain in 1986.
   In a 3-0 decision, the court ruled there was no proof Chestman
knew that information about the takeover of Waldbaum Inc., which
trickled down to him through a family chain, was confidential.
   Also, the panel by a 2-1 vote slammed the door on a key
Securities Exchange Act provision that makes any trading using
confidential information a crime, even if the trader isn't
violating a fiduciary responsibility to the company involved.
   That provision _ known as Rule 14e-3 _ was adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in 1980 to broaden its attack on
insider trading.
   The government has relied on fraud rules and case law to
prosecute insider trading, which became a household term during the
boom years last decade via fraud rings run by figures such as
Boesky and investment banker Martin Siegel.
   ``I think it's a very substantial blow to both the Justice
Department and the SEC's enforcement efforts if the decision
stands,'' said Robert L. Plotz, a former assistant U.S. attorney
who prosecuted the Chestman case, now in private practice.
   SEC Enforement Director William McLucas declined to comment on
the decision's impact, saying the commission was disappointed but
still reviewing the case. The government could ask for a full
appeals court review or appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Lawyers said the decision erodes some power investigators had
gained over insider trading. They said without a statutory
definition, the government was leaving the door open to future
cases that will chip away at its authority.
   ``They ought to define it as a matter of criminal law,'' said
Don Buchwald, who defended former Wall Street Journal reporter R.
Foster Winans in a 1985 insider trading case. ``Fairness requires
you have a definition, especially if you're going to put people in
jail.''
   But Congress repeatedly has resisted efforts to define insider
trading on the theory that pinpointing illegal behavior would leave
loopholes for abuse. A lack of consensus about a law also has been
cited.
   Chestman was convicted by a jury on 31 counts of fraud last year
and spent about 10 months in federal prison before his release
Wednesday.
   Two congressional aides to committees that oversee the SEC said
it was too soon to tell whether the Chestman case would resurrect a
movement to define insider trading. The most recent attempt was in
1988, when Congress stiffened insider trading penalties.
   The appeals court nullified Rule 14e-3, which allowed
prosecutors broad leeway to chase insider trading in a corporate
takeovers, a situation that often caused a target company's stock
price to jump. The rule was designed to attack wrongdoing that
didn't necessarily involve a company directly.
   Other SEC rules already made clear that individuals with
responsibilities to a company, including employees, management,
directors, lawyers and other advisers, could not trade on
market-sensitive information about it.
   Columbia University law professor John C. Coffee Jr. said that
under the added rule it was ``enough to show that the individual
had reason to believe the information came from a source either
within the bidder or the target.''
   The rule was used in key Wall Street civil and criminal fraud
cases, including the original case against former junk bond
financier Michael Milken, though not in his plea bargain admitting
securities and tax fraud last month.
   Besides the Rule 14e-3 question, the appeals court ruled that
Chestman heard no more than ``family gossip'' when the husband of
the daughter of the sister of Waldbaum's family patriarch told him
the company would be sold.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Pick Up in April</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Apparel retailers got a lift during April as the arrival of
Easter and spring weather brought consumers back into the stores.
   Many stores that had a disappointing March fared better last
month, according to figures released Thursday by several of the
nation's biggest retailers.
   Woolworth Corp., whose sales had fallen in March compared with a
year earlier, had an 18.2 percent sales gain in April at stores
open at least a year, and a 21.1 percent increase overall.
   Results from stores open a year or longer _ known as same- or
comparable-store sales _ give a more accurate reading of a
retailer's performance.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, reported
a 3.1 percent same-store sales increase and 1.6 percent overall
gain.
   Most of Sears' improvement was due to clothing sales, not the
company's well-known line of appliances and other durable goods,
said Monroe Greenstein, a retail industry analyst with Bear Stearns
&amp; Co.
   Consumers still burdened by high installment debt were again
cautious about major expenditures, but they were willing to pick up
new clothes. Greenstein said this trend, which has been in place
for several years, would continue until later in 1990.
   Retail sales are closely watched not only as a gauge of the
industry's health and that of individual companies, but also as an
economic barometer. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds
of the gross national product.
   Changes in the calendar _ such as Easter falling on April 9 this
year and on March 26 last year _ often have an impact on retail
sales and affect year-to-year comparisons by inflating results in
some months.
   However, after accounting for the shift, the industry's results
in April were generally favorable, said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail
analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Analysts consider March and April sales together in assessing
how well a store has performed.
   Among other retailers announcing April results Thursday:
   _Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 7 percent increase in
same-store sales, while overall results were up 20 percent.
   _J.C. Penney Co. Inc. had a disappointing month after a much
stronger March. Penney's same-store sales fell 2.8 percent, while
overall sales were off 1.7 percent.
   Greenstein said Penney's sales looked bleaker than they actually
were because they were compared against especially strong results
in April 1989, when the company ran special sales promotions.
   _Melville Corp., which runs specialty chains including Thom
McAn, Kay-bee and CVS, said its overall sales rose 21.9 percent.
Melville did not release same-store figures.
   Other major retailers, including Dayton Hudson Corp. and May
Department Stores Co., are expected to release their sales figures
next Thursday. Analysts said it appeared these companies _ which
own some of the country's biggest department store chains _ would
report favorable results.
   K mart Corp., the nation's biggest discount chain, and Limited
Inc., the largest specialty apparel retailer, also are expected to
announce results next week.
   The figures released Thursday differ from the federal
government's monthly retail sales report. Besides stores, the
government's figures include sales at a range of establishments
from auto dealerships and supermarkets to restaurants and movie
theaters.

<HEAD>Avon Shareholders Urge Company to Put Poison Pill Defense to Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmetics giant Avon Products Inc. is under
pressure from its shareholders to either drop a key takeover
defense or put it to a vote.
   Shareholders approved two non-binding proposals Thursday at
their annual meeting relating to the company's share rights plans,
commonly known as poison pills, that can make unsolicited buyout
bids prohibitively expensive.
   The company has been in turmoil for more than a year as it found
buyers for its health care business and a fragrance company while
improving the profitability of the direct selling business on which
it was founded.
   It struck a deal with a large investor group that resulted in
putting two of the group's representatives on its board and the
formation of a committee to explore the company's alternatives,
which include more asset sales, a recapitalization or outright sale
of the company.
   Avon management opposed both shareholder proposals on its share
rights plans, and favors keeping the company independent while
pursuing its own plan for sales and earnings growth by focusing on
direct selling.
   One proposal urged the company to either drop the rights plan or
submit it to a shareholder vote. The second urged a vote on the
plan.
   Both passed with nearly 25.4 million shares in favor, more than
16.7 million opposed and more than 16.7 million abstaining.
   The United Shareholders Association, a Washington, D.C.-based
advocacy group, said it was behind one of the proposals.
   ``Avon's management would be foolish not to implement proposals
that so clearly expressed the will of the shareholders,'' said
association director Ralph Whitworth.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Avon fell 75 cents a
share to $36.37{.
   The shareholders also elected four directors to the Avon board,
including two nominees representing the investor group Chartwell
Associates LP. Chartwell owns 12 percent of Avon's voting stock and
had planned to run a slate of candidates for the four open seats on
the 11-member board.
   But under a settlement reached in late March, Avon agreed to
support two Chartwell nominees along with two incumbent directors
for the four seats that were up for election. Those nominees were
elected Thursday.
   In addition, Avon agreed to set up a committee to consider ways
of boosting value for Avon stockholders. The committee will include
four Avon directors and executives and the two new board members
from Chartwell, M. Anthony Fisher and Marc Leland.
   The settlement also called for the appointment of John P.
Rochon, a principal in the Chartwell group, as an Avon advisor once
he resigns as vice chairman of Mary Kay Cosmetics, Avon's
Dallas-based rival.
   James E. Preston, chairman and chief executive of Avon, said
negotiations are continuing on how much Rochon will be paid and
said there was ``no financial settlement at all'' with Chartwell.
   Preston said he did not feel Avon had ``a hostile relationship''
with Chartwell, which also includes members of the Fisher real
estate family of New York and Gordon P. Getty, the oil heir.
   Avon recently voted to lower the threshold of its rights plan to
make one element of it effective when an outsider buys 12.5 percent
of its stock rather than the previous 20 percent.
   The action came after Chartwell disclosed it had raised its
voting stake in Avon to 12 percent from 7.5 percent. Chartwell won
a court order against the Avon board on the threshold increase.
Avon has appealed.
   Preston told about 400 people gathered for the meeting at the
Museum of Natural History that Avon was making progress by focusing
on its core business.
   He said Avon would push ahead with plans to sell its 60 percent
interest in Avon Japan by the end of the year. An earlier proposal
to sell the stake to Tokyo-based Friends of Freesia Ltd. for $450
million fell through.
   Asked why Avon was getting out of Japan while other companies
were scrambling to get in, Preston said Avon Japan's market niche
is in danger of being eroded by bigger companies and would require
large investments to defend.
   ``We are better off selling that business and cashing out today
... and reinvesting in markets where we can grow faster,'' he said.

   Those supermarket tabloid headlines may have to
get even wilder to hold their own against TV in the checkout aisle.
   Cable giant Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and ActMedia, a
marketing firm specializing in promotions in the store, said
Thursday they are teaming up to design a TV service for shoppers
lined up to bag and pay for their groceries.
   The Checkout Channel will feature news, sports and other
specially-tailored programming _ plus advertising _ on TV monitors
placed above each checkout aisle.
   Turner and ActMedia plans to test the service this summer,
launch it nationally in early 1991 and install it in 5,000
supermarkets by mid-1992.
   Wayne W. LoCurto, chief executive and president of ActMedia,
said the service should help advertisers reach 30 million to 40
million people each week while making the wait in the checkout line
more enjoyable for shoppers.
   If the plan works, it would be the latest commercial
encroachment into places that formerly were beyond the reach of
television advertisers.
   In recent months, media companies either have introduced or
announced plans to develop commercial TV programs designed to reach
teens in the classroom, women at the beauty salon and patients in
the doctor's waiting room.
   ``There will be a few people to complain, but we believe the
overwhelming majority of people will like it,'' LoCurto said in a
telephone interview.
   ``It's informative, entertaining and it's going to make their
wait seem to go quicker,'' he said.
   Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting has agreed to create
specially-tailored programs of news, sports, business, weather and
consumer information taken mainly from its Headline News cable
network. Each eight-minute program will include 2{ minutes of
commercials.
   The programs will be delivered by satellite 24 hours a day to
participating stores which will be equipped with TV monitors above
each checkout aisle.
   ActMedia plans to provide the TV sets and the satellite hardware.
   LoCurto said the sets will be designed so that the sound shuts
off unless someone approaches within a half-dozen feet or so of the
monitor.
   But once someone gets that close, there will be no way to shut
the set off or adjust the volume, he said.
   He said the programs are being broken into eight-minute shows,
roughly the same amount of time as the average wait in a checkout
line.
   Turner and ActMedia plan to test the system from August through
October in 12 stores in six cities, although they would not name
the cities. LoCurto said plans are to begin a national service in
the first quarter of 1991 and said he hopes to have the Checkout
Channel in 5,000 of the nation's 30,000 supermarkets by mid-1992.
   LoCurto declined to give the cost of launching the system or the
relative investments of Turner and ActMedia in the venture.
   ActMedia expects to generate about $100 million a year in
revenue from the the two minutes of advertising time it sells on
each eight-minute program, while Turner will get to keep proceeds
from the ads in the remaining half-minute.
   LoCurto said Actmedia will share some of its revenue with
supermarkets. Advertisers will be asked to pay rates roughly
equivalent to those charged on daytime television.
   Ad time will be sold for terms of a year or more with an annual
rate of about $12 million for a 15-second ad in each show once the
system is in 5,000 stores.
   ActMedia, based in Darien, Conn., and a unit of Heritage Media
Corp. of Dallas, Texas, was founded in 1973 and is the leader in
in-store marketing programs. It operates couponing and sampling
programs and places advertising on shopping carts, aisle
directories and store shelves in 20,000 supermarkets.

<HEAD>Auto Sales Edge Up Despite Chrysler Drop</HEAD>

   Mild revivals by General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. and strong gains by Japanese ``transplants'' helped boost
sales of North American-made vehicles by 2.8 percent in late April
despite a sharp drop at Chrysler Corp.
   Overall, North American-made cars and trucks sold at an average
rate of 47,684 during the period, up 2.8 percent. The average rate
for Big Three vehicles was 41,543, up just 0.1 percent from the
same period of 1989.
   GM's total vehicle sales were up 5.2 percent in the April 21-30
period and Ford's gained 7.8 percent, but Chrysler reported a 25.4
percent decline. The nation's No. 3 automaker said car sales
dropped 33.8 percent in the period and light truck sales were down
16.5 percent.
   ``Industry sales are still at a fragile pace,'' said Scott
Merlis, auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   Sales of the transplants, vehicles made a Japanese-owned
factories in the United States, rose 16.5 percent for the period to
a combined average sales rate of 5,135 a day. For the year through
the end of April, transplant sales were up a sharp 39.4 percent.
   The latest figures may show the beginning of a rally for the
world's No. 1 automaker, said analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. ``I have a feeling that GM's market
share may have effectively bottomed out.''
   And Kirnan said Ford may report stronger increases as its new
Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer compacts, still scarce on dealers'
lots, become easier for customers to find.
   He blamed much of Chrysler's plunge on the company's move to
de-emphasize fleet sales, which he pointed out will hurt sales
numbers but could help the company's bottom line.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca has said Chrysler would cut down on
business with company, rental and other fleets. Though the high
volume, low profit margin business helps sales figures, it adds
little to earnings.
   For the year to date, Big Three car and truck sales ran 6.1
percent behind last year, with car sales lagging 8.6 percent and
truck sales down 2.3 percent.
   That left total domestic car and light truck sales down 3.2
percent for the year.
   Sales of imported cars and trucks were down 10.7 percent for
April and down 5.8 percent for the year, in part reflecting the
substitution by Japanese car companies of domestically made
vehicles.
   GM said its late-April car sales picked up by 4.1 percent from
last year and truck sales gained 7.6 percent. GM car sales since
January were down 4.8 percent, while truck sales for the year were
up 2.8 percent.
   Ford said late-April car sales edged up 1.6 percent while truck
sales gained 17.3 percent. For the year, Ford said car sales were
still off last year's pace by 10.3 percent and truck sales trailed
2.6 percent.
   Chrysler said its year-to-date car sales were 18.6 percent
behind last year's and truck sales lagged 6.2 percent.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for third period of April 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 25 selling days this year and 25
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 102 selling days
this year and 101 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as
domestic. They appear separately and combined as transplant cars in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>Auto Cos. Coming Out of Own Recession?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher-than-expected first quarter earnings for
the Big Three automakers may mean they are coming out of a severe
recession, analysts say.
   Earnings reported Thursday by General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co., combined with those released Tuesday by Chrysler Corp.,
were down 64 percent compared with the same three months of last
year.
   The decline fell short of Wall Street analysts predictions of a
cumulative drop of more than 75 percent.
   ``It's almost like the auto industry was going through its own
inventory recession in the first quarter, and in a sense it's
coming out of its own, self-created recession in the second
quarter,'' analyst David Healy of Barclays-BZW of New York said.
   Analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. said signs of
recovery, although welcome, were relative.
   ``When you go from a depression to a recession it's a nice
improvement,'' he said.
   Each of the Big Three laid part of the blame for lower profits
on severe production cuts they instituted in January to help reduce
inventories which had built to a high, 90-selling-day level at the
end of last year.
   The production reduction, coupled with increased incentives,
knocked inventories down to the 65-day range, considered good for
this time of year.
   But the two-pronged attack, combined with economic and labor
problems overseas, ate into profits.
   Ford's overseas earnings were hammered by strikes in Europe and
economic problems in Brazil.
   ``I think we are going to see a material drag on Ford's earnings
from Brazil in the second quarter largely because there has been no
production there since the 15th of March,'' analyst John Kirnan of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. said.
   On that day, Ford shut down its Autolatina plant after the
government froze most savings in an attempt halt inflation that was
running at an annual rate of more than 4,000 percent.
   The plant is back in operation, but it will take time for it to
gear up production to pre-shutdown levels.
   GM, which declined to detail regional operations, said it set
record overseas profits but also had been hurt in Brazil, although
to a smaller extent than Ford.
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said the effects of Brazil's
economic problems may show up later for GM.
   Chrysler has few overseas operations.
   The Big Three said they earned $1.29 billion in the quarter,
down from $3.54 billion from the year-ago period. Combined revenues
fell 11 percent to $61.27 billion.
   GM said it earned $710 million, or $1.02 per share of common
stock, on revenues of $30.11 billion, compared with $1.55 billion,
or $2.37 a share, on revenues of $33.24 billion in the year-ago
period.
   Ford said it made $506.2 million, or $1.10 a share, compared
with $1.64 billion, or $3.44 a share, a year ago. Revenues fell 9
percent to $23.6 billion from $25.87 billion.
   Earlier in the week, Chrysler reported earnings of $71 million,
down 80 percent from the year-ago period.
   Through the first quarter of this year, Big Three car and truck
sales were 3.6 percent behind last year's pace. Figures for January
through April released Thursday showed sales of Big Three North
American-made vehicles slid to 6.1 percent behind last year's pace.
   The companies also said increased incentive costs during the
quarter chewed up profits.

<TEXT>
   An agreement by OPEC members to jointly curb
overproduction won't provide a quick fix for the oil market, where
prices continue to sag, analysts say.
   In fact, the market's initial reaction to the accord reached
Thursday was to push prices decisively lower in fairly heavy
trading.
   ``The market may have been looking for more than OPEC was
willing to give,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy analyst for Elders
Futures Inc. in New York. ``It came out looking like another of
these vaguely unsatisfying agreements.''
   The cartel's 13 members came out of a two-day emergency session
with an accord to cut total output by 1.455 million barrels a day
for the next three months.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hope the
cutback will help prices recover to the group's minimum reference
price of $18 a barrel, set in November.
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, fell to $15.90 a barrel in London late Thursday after
OPEC's anouncement. That was down 55 cents from late Wednesday.
   The markets' shaky confidence that OPEC would actually deliver
the promised cut was undermined ``in one fell swoop'' by a comment
from the United Arab Emirates oil minister, said Peter Gignoux,
manager of the international energy desk at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in London.
   ``Selling then begets selling,'' Gignoux said of the market's
reaction.
   The UAE minister, Mana Saeed Otaiba, said on leaving the meeting
that his country would cut its oil production to 1.9 million
barrels a day from 2.1 million barrels.
   The statement caused industry analysts to doubt the Persian Gulf
country's commitment to lowering output because they estimate the
UAE's actual production already is at 1.9 million barrels.
   At best, analysts predicted the cartel will muster a total
reduction of 1 million barrels.
   Overproduction by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait has caused a worldwide oil glut just as demand traditionally
eases in the second quarter, analysts say.
   Since about mid-March, the price of West Texas Intermediate
crude oil has seesawed above $20 a barrel, back down to nearly $16,
up again to almost $19.50 and then back down again to $18.
   The June contract for WTI, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude,
fell 69 cents Thursday to settle at $17.99 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Although recent oil price movements have been ``violent,''
Gignoux said, ``We're not talking disaster and I don't think
anybody in the marketplace feels we are heading for an '85, '86
situation.'' He was referring to the price collapse a few years ago
that sent prices plunging to below $10 a barrel.
   ``This is simply an indication of second quarter weakness and
oversupply,'' Gignoux said.
   Analysts say increased demand and a slowdown in production from
the North Sea and Alaska should boost prices later in the year.
   ``I think we have to wait for winter restocking and winter
demand to turn things around,'' said Geoff Pyne, an analyst with
UBS Phillips and Drew in London.
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena said OPEC's quota violators were
to contribute most of the cutback by returning to their official
output ceilings. All members will participate in the reduction,
though, he added.
   OPEC pumped 23.5 million barrels a day in April, Boussena said,
well above the cartel's official ceiling of 22.1 million barrels
for the first half of the year.
   The cartel postponed its regular midyear session for a month to
July 25, when it will rethink its output and pricing policy for the
remainder of 1990.

<HEAD>America West Says No Deal Made With TWA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines says it has made no deal
to take over some of the domestic business of TWA, but industry
analysts say the young, lean carrier might have what it takes to
make such a deal work.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn said this week that the smaller company
might be just the cure his loss-making domestic airline operation
needs. America West, which is non-union, may make profits where he
cannot, Icahn said.
   The company, which was founded in 1983, has a reputation for low
costs, on-time service, clean planes and a very aggressive business
stance.
   America West Chairman Edward R. Beauvais and President Michael
J. Conway said in a joint statement Thursday that there have been
talks but no deals have been struck.
   ``It is well known that there are airlines in the United States
that are considering the disposal of various assets, and we have
been contacted to determine our level of interest,'' the statement
said.
   ``As a matter of policy,'' it continued, ``we do not respond to
speculation regarding potential transactions. Accordingly, we will
not comment further on these or any other possible transactions
until such time as there is relevant and concrete information to
announce.''
   Paul H. Nisbet, senior airline analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, said America West had ``a very
low-cost structure.''
   He added, ``It may be able to capitalize on a motivated work
force. It's bust or boom with that kind of an operation, and right
now they are booming. They're aggressive as hell.''
   Analysts also said the airline had a reputation for clean, new
planes and customer service. America West ranks first in federal
on-time performance tests.
   Icahn and officials of the TWA pilots' and machinists' unions
met Tuesday with officers of America West at the Icahn &amp; Co.
headquarters in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
   At the meeting, Icahn said he would not need cash from the
smaller airline. Instead, America West would simply take over his
domestic operations, leaving him with TWA's international routes,
which he considers much more valuable.
   America West has 12,000 employees and 92 planes. With gross
revenue of $993.4 million last year, it was designated as a
``major'' airline. It has hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas, Nev.
   Nisbet said the airline was pushing hard for expansion into the
Pacific Rim, narrowly losing a recent bid on a Hawaii-to-Tokyo
route. It also bid on the Eastern Airlines shuttle between Boston,
New York and Washington, which was sold to developer Donald Trump
last year, and expressed interest in the shuttle again last week
after Trump suggested he might sell it.
   ``So they are looking in every direction,'' he said.
   But, Nisbet cautioned, the company is highly leveraged, carrying
a proportionately high level of debt. That means substantial cash
investments could be difficult, he said.
   Still, Nisbet said America West could restore profitability to
TWA's domestic operations.
   ``They are, I think, very well-managed. And they have a very
smooth labor-management situation, something that Carl Icahn hasn't
found out how to achieve,'' Nisbet said.
   News of the possible takeover by a non-union airline did nothing
to improve those labor relations.
   Kent Scott, leader of the TWA pilots union, said his requests
for financial details have gone unanswered.
   ``From what I see, the proposal doesn't make any sense,'' he
said. He dismissed the negotiations as a ``pressure tactic.''
   TWA lost $300 million last year and had to pay $366 million in
interest on debts of $2.5 billion.
   Icahn has asked the pilots for wage concessions of 10 percent.
He has promised to buy up to 100 new jets in return for the
concessions. The alternative, Icahn said, is to ``shrink'' the
airline through deals like one with America West.

   Environmentalists are praising the Senate
Agriculture Committee for toughening conservation efforts on farms
through the 1990 farm bill.
   ``It's a major step forward,'' Ken Cook of the Center for
Resource Economics said Thursday after the committee finished work
on the conservation section of legislation that will set
agriculture policy for the next five years.
   ``We're very pleased with the way the committee has responded to
environmental concerns,'' said Cook, who lobbied for tougher
standards.
   Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the bill is good
for both the environment and farmers. ``This new title
significantly strengthens the conservation provisions of current
law,'' he said.
   Leahy said the 1985 farm bill ``signaled a new attitude in
Congress about the important role our farmers play in preserving
the environment. They also set the standard by which the 1990 farm
bill will be judged.''
   Most of the provisions were approved Wednesday, but one of the
stickiest _ the section on wetlands _ was passed out of committee
Thursday.
   It actually eases up on farmers in some ways.
   Current law strips a farmer of his or her federal subsidies if
wetlands are drained and planted with crops.
   If the new measure becomes law, violators would be fined $750 to
$10,000 and required to restore the wetland. The farmer would be
removed from federal crop programs after a second offense.
   The farmer would have his record expunged after 10 years and
return to first-time violator status if wetlands are drained again.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., voted against the wetlands measure
because he felt farmers sometimes make innocent mistakes and the
potential for abuse by regulators under the legislation was too
high.
   The new measure also allows drainage of land that has been
extensively farmed, but still has wetland characteristics, if the
drainage would have minimal effect on wetland values.
   Most of the time, a farmer would have to restore another piece
of property to prevent net wetland loss.
   A provision that toughens current wetland policy outlaws the
draining of land if the intention is to make it available for
planting at some time. Under the law enacted in 1985, a farmer has
to actually plant on the drained land to be a violator.
   Enforcement of federal wetland policy is conducted by the Soil
Conservation Service and the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service. Fish and Wildlife Service agents make reports
when they see lands in use that are supposed to remain in a wet
condition.
   Wetlands are important not only as habitats for wildlife, but as
natural filters for pollutants. Only about half the country's
original wetlands still exist and the government is fighting to
save them.
   Conservation measures adopted by the committee Wednesday
included:
   _Enrollment of at least 40 million acres by 1995 in a program
that pays farmers not to plant, in order to protect highly erodible
land, marginal pasturelands, windbreaks and vegetation planted for
wildlife.
   _Payments to farmers who enroll in a new program to reduce water
contamination by cutting back on fertilizers and chemicals that
cause pollution.
   _Technical assistance from the Agriculture Department to help
farmers meet state and federal environmental standards.
   _Purchase of wetlands from farmers.
   _Requirements that farmers keep records of pesticides they use.
   _Assistance to states that want to protect farms from being
converted to other uses.
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, introduced conservation legislation Thursday with
many provisions similar to the Senate bill. Hearings on it will be
held later.

   Advertisers think a new program, ``Video
Power,'' will keep kids glued to their television sets. A TV
watchdog group thinks the show may be bending the law.
   Although ``Video Power'' is not on the air yet, Action for
Children's Television, the Boston-based advocacy group, complained
about the show to the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday.
   ACT's filing with the FCC was prompted by a report in Monday's
Wall Street Journal that commercials would be inserted into ``Video
Power'' so seamlessly that young viewers wouldn't be able to tell
where the ads begin and the program leaves off.
   The Journal said the half-hour syndicated show, planned to air
weekdays after school next fall, would be hosted by a 14-year-old
named ``Johnny Arcade.'' Johnny, the Journal said, ``will rattle
off `news' items, such as countdowns of top hits in video games.
Sandwiched in the minute-long countdowns will be 10-second or
20-second commercials, without so much as a pause between the news
and the commercial.''
   ACT thinks the show as described violates FCC rules that require
TV producers to clearly distinguish advertising in kids' shows and
that prohibit a show's host from peddling products.
   ``We are requesting a public notice (from the FCC) to
investigate the trend in children's TV which blatantly ignores
existing FCC policy,'' ACT attorney Donna Lampert said in an
interview.
   The show also will include interviews with video-game champions
and will feature cartoons with characters from current video games.
Some of those characters are based on video games from Acclaim
Entertainment Inc., which is buying 20 percent of the show's
commercial time, the Journal said.
   ``We're ecstatic about the format,'' Acclaim executive Anthony
Williams told the newspaper. ``Children change channels during
commercials. For one thing, their concentration span is shorter
than that of adults. ... This, we think, is a good way for both
producer and advertiser to sidestep that problem.''
   Attempts to locate Acclaim Entertainment or the producers of
``Video Power'' were not successful Thursday.
   The FCC in 1984 lifted rules that limited the amount of
advertising that may be shown during children's shows. At the same
time, however, the commission reaffirmed its 1974 rules on host
selling and ad-program separation in children's shows.
   In its 1974 ruling, the commission said ``young children lack
the necessary sophistication to appreciate the nature and purpose
of advertising.''
   Efforts are under way in Congress to restore ad limits on kids'
shows: 10{ minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on
weekdays.
   The Journal also said corporations increasingly are promoting
their products in movies or home videos.
   McDonald's Corp. has sold about 250,000 copies of a 30-minute
``McTreasure Island'' video in which Ronald McDonald and pals step
into the Robert Lewis Stevenson classic, ``Treasure Island,'' to
help save Jim Hawkins from Long John Silver and aid in finding the
treasure, the newspaper said.
   Motion picture companies also reap substantial fees for using
advertisers' products in their movies.
   The FCC does not regulate videos or movies.

   The Soviet Union has emerged as a stunning new
market for broilers and may edge out Japan this year as the
traditional No. 1 foreign market for U.S. poultry, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   More than 110 million pounds of broiler leg quarters were sold
to the Soviet Union recently by U.S. companies, a sale worth an
estimated $50 million.
   The Soviets began buying U.S. broilers last fall for the first
time in years. According to the department's Economic Research
Service, the 1989 sales involved about 26 million pounds.
   USDA economist Larry Witucki said in a telephone interview
Thursday that Moscow has bought around 260 million pounds of U.S.
broilers so far in calendar 1990. Those could have a value in the
range of $100 million to $150 million.
   ``I would say (the Soviets) are going to surpass the Japanese
this year,'' Witucki said. ``The Japanese market is growing, but
not that fast.''
   The Soviet Union has been buying U.S. grain for years and is
apparently is committed to remain a major buyer for the long haul.
Can broiler producers expect similar demand from chicken-hungry
Kremlin leaders?
   Witucki said the Soviet broiler market is characterized by large
potential and large uncertainty. It's hard to tell at the moment
what may happen, he said.
   Japan topped the list of U.S. broiler markets overseas at 233
million pounds in calendar 1989, which Witucki said was a downward
revision from 339.9 million pounds initially reported by U.S.
Customs. The Soviets already have passed that mark for 1990.
   Witucki said 1989 U.S. Customs figures for broiler exports to
Hong Kong, currently shown at 206.6 million pounds, are under
review for possible errors.
   Other big foreign markets include Mexico, Canada, Singapore,
Jamaica, Spain and French Polynesia.
   Overall, subject to revision, the USDA figures published in a
current outlook report show broiler exports rose to a record value
of about $441 million in 1989, up 15 percent from 1988.
   ``Another broiler export record is expected in 1990 because
sales to Japan and other Pacific Rim markets will likely remain
strong,'' said the report, which was written prior to the recent
new sale to the Soviets.
   It added, ``Although exports could decline to Mexico and Canada,
where production is expected to increase, the U.S.S.R. and some
Eastern European countries will become a major new market.''
   In a related report, the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service says the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe represent
``substantial market opportunities'' for U.S. meat and poultry
exporters.
   If goals for meat consumption are to be met, domestic and
imported supplies will have to increase. A main thrust will be in
rising demand for improved livestock breeding and technology.
   The report said average Soviet citizens spend 50 percent to 60
percent of their take-home salary of 200 rubles per month ($330)
for food.
   ``Even so, strong demand for meat products persists,'' the
report said. ``During the opening of the first McDonald's food
franchise restaurant in the U.S.S.R., hundreds of Muscovites line
up to pay three rubles and 75 kopecks _ about one-third of a day's
wage _ to purchase a Big Mac.''
   Meat consumption in the Soviet Union includes about 44 percent
beef, 34 percent pork, 5 percent sheep, lamb and other meat, and 17
percent poultry, the report said.

   Thailand is one of the few developing
countries with a substantial food surplus, says an Agriculture
Department report. And that is important to U.S. farmers.
   In the last 20 years, the Southeast Asian country of 56 million
people has established itself as a strong competitor in world feed
grain markets, the report said.
   Recent years have shown Thailand to be the world's largest rice
exporter, the fifth-largest corn exporter and an important exporter
of sorghum, all commodities that rank highly as U.S. exports.
   But Thailand also is boosting livestock output, according to the
report by Sara J. Schwartz and Douglas H. Brooks of the
department's Economic Research Service. Looking ahead to the turn
of the century, that raises some possibilities.
   Under a ``moderate growth'' scenario developed for the study,
Thailand's rice and poultry meat exports ``may increase
substantially'' by the year 2000. Other livestock also are likely
to increase.
   Thus, according to the report, Thailand's corn exports could
decline significantly over the next decade as more feed is needed
for livestock.
   ``Expectations of Thailand's falling corn exports and rapidly
rising imports of oilseed meal (for high-protein animal feed) can
create important market opportunities for U.S. corn and soybean
meal exporters,'' the report said. ``However, the United States may
face increasing competition in world rice and poultry meat
markets.''
   The projections showed Thailand's poultry meat production could
more than double by 2000 as domestic and export demands increase.
Pork production also could more than double ``if incomes continue
to rise and marketing constraints are relaxed,'' the report said.

<HEAD>SEC Investigating Genentech Stock Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Genentech Inc., a
biotechnology firm under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said the probe won't affect its plans to merge
with Swiss drug giant Roche Holding Ltd.
   But the deal, which shareholders will vote on next month, could
be delayed by the Federal Trade Commission, which has requested
more information.
   Genentech spokesman Jack Murphy said Thursday neither Genentech
nor Roche has finished filing all the documents sought by the FTC.
   The SEC is investigating unusual trading activity in Genentech's
stock on the Pacific Stock Exchange just before the disclosure of
Roche's plan to buy 60 percent of Genentech shares in a $2.1
billion deal.
   Investigators are focusing on ``certain communications'' between
Mollie Raab, wife of Genentech Chief Executive Kirk Raab, and an
unnamed member of her family.
   Genentech said Raab had told his wife about the merger plans,
which were announced on February 2. Although Mollie Raab is a
subject of the SEC investigation, Genentech said that she did not
purchase any securities herself.
   Genentech said Raab and his wife ``have cooperated fully with
the SEC'' and that neither would comment on the situation because
the inquiry was still open.
   The SEC probe was disclosed in a filing by Genentech of a proxy
statement describing the proposed merger with Roche.
   In a move related to the merger, Genentech granted its six top
officers lucrative ``golden parachute'' agreements under which they
would receive an amount five times their salaries should they be
terminated as a result of the merger, the Wall Street Journal
reported in today's editiosn.
   Under the plan, Kirk Raab stands to receive about $6.6 million
as well as stock options valued at $7.9 million should he lose his
job in the deal, the paper said.

<TEXT>
   State gaming regulators announced a
routine audit of Donald Trump's financial empire while the tycoon's
newest casino hired an independent auditor to examine bills of
contractors angry about not getting paid.
   New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Director Anthony Parrillo said
Thursday that such a review by his agency is ``normal,'' and that
it hasn't looked at Trump's operations for a long time.
   ``This isn't to sound or signal that there are problems,'' he
said.
   The review will include all the billionaire develper's holdings
in and outside of Atlantic City, he said.
   About 100 contractors involved in the $1 billion Taj Mahal
Casino Resort have gone to the state Casino Control Commission in
an effort to get paid.
   The contractors, who claim Trump owes them $35 million, are
angry because they pushed to meet the casino's April 2 opening date
based on promises they would be paid in full.
   Some also charged that Trump has withheld payment he faces a
cash-flow problem.
   The audit, announced Thursday, will examine labor costs, time
and material payment requests, change orders and expense
reimbursements.
   Ed Tracy, president and chief executive officer of Trump's three
Atlantic City casinos, said the contractors are wrong, adding that
their complaints come ``at a time when everybody is taking a shot
at Donald Trump.''
   Trump said last week he was considering selling some of his
holdings, including Manhattan real estate and the Trump Shuttle
airline, to raise cash.
   Tracy said withholding payment until completion of the audit is
a common practice in the construction business.
   ``There's nothing unusual about this except the size of the
project,'' Tracy said.

   Residents of the Connecticut suburbs of New
York City had a per capita personal income in 1988 nearly four
times higher than those of a South Texas metropolitan area at the
bottom of a new government list.
   The Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury, Conn., area retained
its top ranking with per capita personal income of $29,084,
compared with $7,302 for the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, area,
the Commerce Department said Thursday.
   The Connecticut suburbs, with per capita income of $26,316, also
were at the top of the 1987 list of 319 metropolitan areas surveyed
by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission was last in 1987, too, at $7,001.
   For the nation as a whole, per capita income in 1988 was
$16,490, up from $15,484 a year earlier. Per capita personal income
is the annual total personal income of residents divided by the
area population.
   New York City was the richest metropolitan area in terms of
total personal income with $174.74 billion in 1988, the study
found. Enid, Okla., was at the other end with a total personal
income of $873 million.
   The total personal income in the United States in 1988 was $4.05
trillion.
   ``Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest per capita
personal income in 1988 also ranked highest in 1983,'' the report
noted.
   Newark, N.J., which ranked 12th in 1983, rose to ninth in 1988
with per capita personal income of $22,963. Anchorage, Alaska,
dropped from first to 17th with per capita income of $21,840.
   Following the Connecticut suburbs of New York City were San
Francisco, $26,309; Bergen-Passaic, N.J., $25,388;
Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., $25,140; Lake County, Ill.,
$24,009; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $23,832; San Jose, Calif., $23,181;
Washington, D.C.-Md.-Va., $23,175; and Newark, N.J., and West Palm
Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach, Fla., $22,824.
   ``Eight of the 10 metropolitan areas with the lowest per capita
personal income in 1988 also ranked lowest in 1983,'' the report
said.
   Joining the South Texas area at the bottom of the list were
Laredo, Texas, $7,452; Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas, $7,868; Las
Cruces, N.M., $9,791; Provo-Orem, Utah, $9,993; El Paso, Texas,
$10,008; Pascagoula, Miss., $10,892; Jacksonville, N.C., $11,262;
Houma-Thibodaux, La., $11,264; and Lawton, Okla., $11,420.
   Anniston, Ala., moved up from 311 to 306 with income of $11,679
and was replaced by Houma-Thibodaux among the bottom 10; the
Clarksville-Hopkinsville, Tenn.-Ky., area went from 312 to 305 with
income of $11,796 and was succeeded by Jacksonville, N.C.
   Following New York at the top of the total personal income list
were Los Angeles-Long Beach, Calif., $161.37 billion; Chicago,
$118.48 billion; Philadelphia, Pa.-N.J., $91.05 billion;
Washington, D.C.-Md.-Va., $86.54 billion;
Boston-Lawrence-Salem-Lowell-Brockton, Mass., $83.11 billion;
Detroit, $80.75 billion; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $63.16 billion;
Houston, $52.58 billion; and Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., $51.35
billion.
   Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the fastest growth in
total personal income from 1983 to 1988 also were on the East
Coast, five of them in Florida, the report said.
   Naples, Fla., led this list with total personal income of $2.99
billion, up 87 percent during the five years compared with the
national average growth of 43 percent.
   Naples was followed by Fort Myers-Cape Coral, Fla., with $5.22
billion, up 75 percent; Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester, N.H., $6.45
billion, up 74.4 percent; Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., $35.66
billion, up 71.7 percent; West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach,
Calif., $18.68 billion, up 70.8 percent.
   Also, Orlando, Fla., $16.05 billion, up 69.6 percent; Ocala,
Fla., $2.28 billion, up 69.4 percent; Manchester-Nashua, N.H.,
$6.98 billion, up 69.3 billion; Atlanta, $50.35 billion, up 68.7
percent, and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., $12.08 billion, up 68.3 percent.

   Stock prices rose today as traders reacted to a
big surprise in the government's latest report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 6.53 to 2,702.70
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 547 up, 177 down and
376 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.90 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   As the work day began on Wall Street, the Labor Department
reported that the civilian unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a
percentage point in April to 5.4 percent.
   The figures also showed an increase of 64,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, far less than economists had been expecting.
   Analysts said the news abruptly dampened recent speculation that
the Federal Reserve might be planning to tighten credit in its
campaign against inflation. Interest rates fell in the credit
markets today.
   But stock traders did not take the news with unequivocal
enthusiasm. Brokers said it raised some fresh doubts about the
outlook for economic growth and corporate profits in the months
ahead.
   Among the blue chips, General Motors rose &rsqb; to 45{;
International Business Machines gained | to 108|; American Express
added &rsqb; to 26~, and General Electric was up &rsqb; at 65&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.83 to 184.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .47 at 345.44.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.53 to
2,696.17, bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 51.12
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 902 up, 569 down and 497 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 145.57 million shares, against 141.61
million in the previous session.

compensate them from the losses they expect to incur as a result of
a planned reform of the Brussels stock exchange, officials said
Friday.
   The Association for the Defense of the Stockbroking Profession,
which represents about 75 percent of the Brussels exchange's
stockbrokers, told the government in a memorandum that minimum
capital requirements and other measures would ``inevitably entail
the disappearance of a certain number of stock houses.''
   In addition to setting minimum capital requirements for brokers,
the reforms will open the exchange to banks and other financial
institutions, tighten rules on insider trading and give more power
to the Belgian Banking Commission, the stock exchange watchdog.
   ``The state, which has promoted this reform, must indemnify
these stockbrokers for the loss of their profession and for the
loss of professional revenues they will sustain,'' the memo states.
   The reforms are part of government's plan to update Belgium's
antiquated financial markets to better compete once the European
Community melds into a single market in 1992.

   Tribune Co. chairman and chief executive officer
Stanton R. Cook has announced he will leave his posts as publisher
of the Chicago Tribune and chief executive of the newspaper's
parent company in August.
   Cook will remain as chairman of the Tribune Co., he told
shareholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday.
   Charles Brumback, president and chief operating officer, will
succeed Cook as chief executive of the Tribune Co.
   John Madigan, president and chief executive of Tribune Co.
subsidiary Chicago Tribune Co., will become the Tribune's
publisher, Cook said.
   ``I will turn 65 years old in July, and for years I have felt it
would be an appropriate time to step down,'' Cook, a former board
member of The Associated Press, said in announcing the decision.
``I am confident in Charlie and John.''
   Cook will leave his former positions Aug. 1.
   Cook, who earned $1.1 million in cash and bonuses last year,
began his career with the Tribune in 1951 and was promoted to
production manager in 1965. He became president of the newspaper in
1972, and became president and chief executive of the Tribune Co.
in 1974. He was elected chairman last year.
   Brumback began his career with the accounting firm Arthur Young
&amp; Co. He rose through the ranks of the Sentinel Star Co., publisher
of the Orlando Sentinel, to become president of the Orlando
Sentinel in 1976. The Tribune Co. purchased the Florida newspaper
in 1965.
   He became president and CEO of the Chicago Tribune in 1981 and
president and chief operating officer of the Tribune Co. last year.
   Madigan, 52, a Chicago native, joined Tribune Co. in 1975 as
vice president and chief financial officer. He was made a director
of the company that same year.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC, which is divesting
its U.S. retail holdings, said Friday it will sell its Ivey's
department store chain to Dillard Department Stores Inc. for $110
million in cash.
   The sale of Ivey's, the last retail division to be sold by BAT,
is expected to be completed in approximately six weeks, the
British-American conglomerate said in a statement.
   Ivey's, founded in 1900, has 23 stores in the Carolinas and
Florida. BAT acquired the chain in 1982.
   Dillard operates 166 department stores in 16 states in the
South, Midwest and Southwest. The company indicated it would
incorporate the Ivey's chain into its operations, keep the stores
open and include all Ivey's employees in its benefit plans, BAT
said.
   The sale of Ivey's is part of a restructuring plan announced by
BAT in September to focus the company on its core tobacco and
financial services operations.
   The restructuring was undertaken as a defense against a hostile
$22 billion takeover bid from an investor group led by Anglo-French
financier James Goldsmith. The group abandoned its bid late last
month, but BAT said it would proceed with its plans.
   BAT has already announced the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue
chain for $1.5 billion to Investcorp, a group that acts on behalf
of wealthy Middle Eastern, American, British and other European
investors.
   BAT also has agreed to sell its Marshall Field's department
stores in the Midwest to the retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. for $1.04
billion, and its John Breuner Co. furniture stores to Prism Capital
Corp., a merchant bank, for $92.5 million in cash.

<HEAD>Norton Profits Down In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover target Norton Co. said Friday
its first- quarter profits fell 35 percent mainly because of losses
stemming from its operations in Brazil, which suffered a severe
recession during the period.
   Norton, a leading abrasives and engineering materials
manufacturer, said net income totaled it $17.2 million, or 89 cents
per share during the quarter, compared with profits of $26.3
million, or $1.25 per share a year earlier.
   Revenues totaled $414.4 million, up 7 percent from $388.2
million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Last month Norton agreed to be acquired by France's Compagnie
Saint-Gobain, one of the world's leading glass makers, for $1.8
billion or $90 a share. The move successfully staved off a $1.6
billion hostile bid by Britain's BTR PLC.
   Norton declined to comment on how the successful battle against
BTR would affect earnings for the year. ``We're not commenting on
the takeover costs,'' company spokesman Francis Doherty said.
   The company said its Brazilian operations accounted for a
15-cent-a-share loss, compared with contributing 11 cents a share
to earnings in the year-ago period.
   ``Brazil has experienced a severe recession during the first
quarter ... due to the acceleration of hyperinflation for the first
two months, followed in March by government-imposed deflationary
measures,'' said Norton Chairman and Chief Executive John M. Nelson.
   Still, Nelson said he was pleased with the company's overall
results considering the economic deterioration in Brazil.
   The Brazilian losses dragged down operating profit in the
abrasives unit by 48 percent in the quarter, when compared to a
particularly strong year-ago period. Operating profit increased
more than 7 percent in the engineered materials unit.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after opening
stronger amid talk of a large sale of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
   There was no confirmation of rumors that the Soviets bought as
much as 3 million metric tons of corn overnight. Grain traders have
become extra-sensitive to talk of large export sales since the
Agriculture Department on Wednesday offered to subsidize sales of 2
million tons of wheat to China.
   Analysts said prices retreated when the Soviet purchase was not
confirmed and amid drenching rains in the Midwestern corn and
soybean belt.
   The rain should be welcomed by farmers, who have had about two
weeks of nearly unbroken dry weather in which to begin their spring
planting.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were unchanged to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.73{ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to } cent lower with May at $2.85{ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to { cent higher with May at $1.67 a bushel;
soybeans were 3\ cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $6.26{ a

   Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were lower.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .12 cent higher with June at
74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with May at 83.75 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to
.27 cent lower with June at 63.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .03 cent to .42 cent lower with May at 69.25 cents a

   Cattle futures settled higher on Thursday; pork futures were

<HEAD>Dow Average Masks Market Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It takes more than a rise in the Dow Jones
industrial average right now to keep many a stock market investor
from feeling low.
   If you use the Dow average as a gauge, stock prices have been
holding their ground of late within about 5 percent of the record
high they reached in the first session of 1990.
   But the picture looks less rosy if you examine it by the light
of several other, less publicized statistical measures that take a
broader sample of stocks into account.
   This ``divergence,'' in the parlance of Wall Street, makes for
hard times in the trading rooms of money managers at investing
institutions, where Mission No. 1 is often to try to beat the
prominent market averages.
   It isn't much of a morale booster either for individual
investors, when they see their own stockholdings losing value while
the market is supposedly giving a good account of itself.
   What's more, some chart-watching analysts on the Street contend,
divergences are a poor portent for the likely future behavior of
the stock market in general.
   ``The overwhelming majority of equities are moving lower while
the major averages are held up by just a few of the big-cap (large
capitalization) names,'' says Joseph Feshbach at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   ``The current condition of the market continues to deteriorate,
indicating that lower prices lie ahead.''
   At the end of April, the Dow Jones industrials stood at 2,645,
not a drastic distance below their peak reading of 2,810 on Jan. 2.
   Over the last trading week of April, by contrast, 296 issues
traded on the New York Stock Exchange hit new lows for the past 52
weeks, compared with just 27 new highs.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the new lows outnumbered the
highs 104 to 17. In the NASDAQ system for over-the-counter stocks,
the margin was 416 to 136.
   ``It's very rare to see a long string of more new lows than new
highs with the Dow close to its high,'' observed Stan Weinstein in
his investment advisory letter The Professional Tape Reader.
   ``The few prior times that it's occurred (early September 1987,
late June-early July 1981, and early January 1973) all foreshadowed
serious market declines.''
   Adds Martin Zweig in his Zweig Forecast letter, ``The
divergences between the blue-chip Dow and the average stock keep
yawning wider, ever increasing the risk.''
   To explain why this kind of disparity troubles them so much,
many Wall Streeters resort to a military metaphor: When the army of
``soldiers'' isn't enthusiastically keeping in step with the
``generals,'' the battle may well be lost.
   One historical precedent for just such a defeat occurred in the
severe bear market of 1973-74, when the select few ``favorite 50''
growth stocks of that era came toppling down along with their more
obscure counterparts.
   To at least a few resolute optimists, however, the outcome need
not be so negative this time. After all, they contend, don't the
present figures suggest that stocks are a lot cheaper than they
might appear at a superficial glance?
   In the view of Martin Sass, chairman of the New York money
management firm of M.D. Sass Investor Services, the circumstances
have set up some potential bargains among small growth stocks and
industrial companies considered sensitive to the ups and downs of
the business cycle.
   The poor showing of the cyclical stocks in the past year or so
``was only partly justified by deteriorating fundamentals,'' Sass
maintains. Furthermore, he says, ``there is growing evidence that
the manufacturing recession has now bottomed out.''

   David Cecil offered an irresistible
guarantee to anyone walking past his display booth at what's billed
as the world's largest convention of inventions.
   ``You'll never have to tie your tie again,'' he said.
   To demonstrate his claim, Cecil tugged at a knot in his silk tie
as if to loosen it. But instead of one end of the fabric slipping
out of the knot, the tie itself zipped open.
   ``Once you start wearing one, you'll never go back to tying a
tie. It's the perfect tie-less tie,'' said Cecil, who represents
Zippertie Enterprises, a Pittsburgh company marketing the tie for a
Midwestern inventor he declined to identify.
   Cecil pulled again on his tie, this time on the short end, and
the zipper hidden in the knot closed up.
   ``A perfect double-Windsor knot,'' he said.
   Cecil and hundreds of other promoters and inventors gathered
Thursday at the Monroeville Expo Mart near Pittsburgh for the
Invention-New Product Exposition, billed as the world's largest.
   Among other items displayed were a portable fire escape that can
be anchored inside a window, a trap designed to lure fleas off a
carpet and a device to repel mosquitoes with sound waves.
   The start of the three-day exhibition also included the
unveiling of a water-powered engine created by Yoshiro Nakamatsu,
who became known as the ``Edison of Japan'' after inventing the
computer floppy disk and the digital watch.
   Nakamatsu said his pollution-free engine, called Enerex, runs on
tap water alone and can create three times the power of a standard
gasoline engine.
   ``It will generate electricity for any purpose,'' he said.
``Petroleum will exhaust in 100 years.''
   He said he will modify the engine and build a special vehicle
powered by it.
   Nakamatsu displayed some of his other inventions, including
packages of ``brain food,'' which he said contains ``good
elements'' to encourage clear thinking. The snack food, which
tastes something like seaweed, is sold in Japan.
   Nakamatsu, 62, said listening to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and
swimming have helped him maintain the creativity that helped him
obtain more than 2,000 patents in the United States and Japan.
   ``My best place to create inventions is under the water,'' he
said. ``So I swim every day.''
   Others said necessity is indeed the mother of invention.
   Ken Wittman said his sore left shoulder prompted him to invent a
guitar strap that hangs on his right shoulder. The strap also
allows the guitar to be worn by right- and left-handed musicians,
and spins all the way around.
   ``And if you can't play at all, you can get their attention,''
he said.
   Kirk Renaud, vice president of DesignTech International Inc.,
exhibited several products, including the Quietwake alarm clock,
which vibrates under a pillow.
   The product was designed for the hard of hearing and also works
well for couples who rise at different hours, he said.
   DesignTech, of Springfield, Va., also markets a remote control
device that activates a beeper in an automobile, helping drivers
find cars in crowded lots.
   Also on display was a plastic gun that clears clogged drains
with a blast of compressed air, golf shoes with playing tips
stitched across the toes and a sand-laden trash can that won't tip
over.

   Outgoing savings and loan bailout chief L.
William Seidman, showered with congressional praise today,
cautioned legislators not to expect miracles from his successor.
   ``Don't be impatient. This is a long hard job. It isn't going to
be accomplished anytime soon,'' Seidman told a House Banking task
force on the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``The real pain of what is taking place, on everything from
increased government borrowing to the effect on real estate
markets, is still being felt. I think it is very important that no
one expect by this time next year we'll all feel great,'' he said.
   President Bush is turning to William Taylor, the Federal Reserve
Board's director of bank supervision, to take over from Seidman,
who recommended that choice.
   If nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate,
Taylor would become chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Resolution Trust Corp. The FDIC insures bank and thrift
institution deposits, while the RTC conducts the S&amp;L cleanup.
   Taylor, 50, got a cautious welcome from task force members. They
praised his experience and ability, but some questioned whether he
would share Seidman's willingness to speak out independently about
the rising cost of the bailout and other conflicts with the
administration.
   ``I worry about the independence of the FDIC and the RTC. I
worry about future policy decisions driven by political spin
control,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the task
force.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called Taylor a ``superb choice,''
but told Seidman, ``I think the administration ... should be on its
hands and knees begging you to stay.''
   He said Taylor's talents will be wasted unless the president
puts a higher priority on the S&amp;L cleanup.
   In a statement Thursday, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said, ``I'd like to see
Bill Seidman finish his term (next year). ... Should he leave, any
nominee would require the thorough assessment of a formal
confirmation process.''
   Vento's panel was conducting a hearing today, with Seidman as a
witness, on the progress of the bailout. It is focusing on the slow
pace so far in selling real estate, loans and other assets the
government has inherited from bankrupt thrifts.
   Seidman has said he would leave sometime after the RTC achieves
its ambitious goal of closing or selling 140 S&amp;Ls by the end of
June. However, Vento said a more important measure of progress will
be whether the agency will avoid having to retain and warehouse
most of the assets of the thrifts it is selling.
   Seidman, 69, had said for some time that he did not plan to stay
until his term ends in October 1991. But he had not indicated his
resignation was imminent.
   On Tuesday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated the
administration would not resist Seidman's departure. However the
president on Thursday disputed a newspaper report suggesting he had
encouraged Seidman to go.
   ``It's his initiative,'' Bush said. ``I think Seidman has
conducted himself with extraordinary grace and great ability.''
   Although he scored points with Congress for his candor in
revealing the bailout's soaring cost estimates, Seidman offended
some administration officials, particularly White House chief of
staff John Sununu and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson.
   On the other hand, Taylor reportedly is well-regarded by
Treasury officials for his low-key style. Since mid-February, he
has been on leave from the Federal Reserve, serving as chief staff
officer of a Treasury-led policy panel overseeing the RTC.
   Taylor has a reputation as a conservative regulator and was one
of the most vigorous advocates of toughening capital standards in
the thrift industry.
   ``He's a safety and soundness man,'' said Kenneth Guenther,
executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of
America.
   Beyond the enormous task of directing the disposal of more than
$300 billion in S&amp;L assets, Taylor will find himself at the center
of a clash next year between the administration and Congress when
the two sides try to come up with a way to fund a second
installment of the bailout.
   Taylor declined to respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Government sources, asking not to be named, said Taylor wants the
FDIC-RTC chairmanship, considered the nation's pre-eminent bank
regulatory post.
   Early this year, he turned down an invitation to become director
of the Office of Thrift Supervision, who serves under the Treasury
secretary. The FDIC chairman, once appointed, serves independently
and cannot be removed by the president.
   Seidman, in a telephone interview, said he backed Taylor because
``he's a very capable guy. He's familiar with the situation and I
have a lot of confidence in him.''
   ``The transition will take place in a very friendly manner when
I think it's the appropriate time,'' Seidman said.

<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange wants to fine the
fallen brokerage Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. $25 million in
connection with securities fraud and other crimes, sources said
Friday.
   The fine would be the largest ever imposed on a securities firm,
but whether the Big Board ever would collect is unclear. Drexel is
liquidating after its parent company filed for bankruptcy court
protection in February.
   The NYSE has the ability to levy fines against member firms and
executives for violating exchange rules and securities laws. The
exchange has been mulling whether to fine Drexel since the firm
pleaded guilty to six felony crimes and agreed to pay $650 million
in government penalties last year.
   The NYSE also is said to be considering brining separate
disciplinary proceedings against Drexel Chief Executive Frederick
H. Joseph and other top officers of the firm.
   Those charges would be in connection with the activities of the
firm and its former junk bond leader, Michael Milken, who pleaded
guilty last month to six separate felonies and agreed to pay $600
million in penalties.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano declined comment on whether
the NYSE was pursuing charges against Drexel. But he said: ``Drexel
is the biggest regulatory problem by a member firm that we've had
in the 200-year history of the New York Stock Exchange.''
   The possible fine first was reported in today's editions of The
Wall Street Journal. People with knowledge of the proceedings who
asked not to be named confirmed the report.
   In a statement, Drexel defended its compliance mechanisms,
saying its procedures were ``as good or better than other firms on
the Street'' and its transgressions chiefly involved verbal
agreements that weren't disclosed to the firm.
   ``It's clear that there were things that went wrong, but the
firm and its shareholder-employees have already paid dearly for
them,'' Drexel said. ``Any further penalties would be added,
unnecessary punishment for creditors and shareholders and could be
viewed simply as piling on.''
   ``We understand the stock exchange's need to project an image of
being a strong regulator,'' it said. ``However, that should be
balanced with a sense of fairness in evaluting the company's and
management's behavior.''
   The Journal report said that the Big Board has stepped up its
investigation of Drexel in recent weeks and has subpoenaed several
individuals to testify about Drexel's and Milken's behavior.
   The charges against Joseph and other Drexel officials that are
being considered were said to include failure to properly supervise
Milken and others. Such charges could be important because they
carry possible expulsion from the securities industry.
   Under stock exchange procedures, Drexel could challenge any
sanction before an NYSE hearing board. The firm later could appeal
any ruling to the NYSE board of directors, the Securities and
Exchange Commission or a federal appeals court.

   Share prices closed mostly higher Friday, buoyed
by better-than-expected results for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative Party in local elections.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up
27.3 points, or 1.26 percent, at 2,162.2. This was slightly below
the day's high of 2,168.0 but well above the opening low of 2,146.4.
   Volume was 437.5 million shares, compared with 392.8 million
Thursday.
   Dealers said the market reacted favorably to the Conservative's
showing in Thursday's nationwide local elections.
   ``It's just been a relief that the Conservatives didn't do as
badly as they were expected to do,'' said one trader, who asked not
to be named.

<HEAD>Unemployment Figures Should Keep Rates Down for Treasury Auctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weaker than expected employment report has
stopped the drive for higher interest rates and should help the
Treasury find buyers for its quarterly sale of notes and bonds this
week, economists say.
   Fears that the economy was expanding too rapidly and threatening
to drive inflation higher had gripped the credit markets in recent
weeks, driving long-term bond yields above 9 percent for the first
time in nearly a year.
   Economic data in the past few weeks had supported that bearish
scenario. The consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 8.5
percent in the first quarter, the fastest rate since the
inflationary spiral at the start of the 1980s.
   Orders for durable goods, a key benchmark for the economy,
surged 6.7 percent in March, and purchasing managers reported that
the manufacturing economy expanded for the first time in 11 months
in April.
   Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department went a long way
toward dissolving those fears, however, and should keep long-term
rates below 9 percent, economists say.
   The nation's unemployment rate ticked up to 5.4 percent in April
from 5.2 percent in March. The number of jobs grew by a slight
64,000 and would have shown a small decline if not for the
temporary hiring of census workers. Factory payrolls fell by
22,000, the 12th drop in the last 13 months.
   ``The best you can say about the manufacturing sector is it's
stopped shrinking,'' said David H. Resler, chief economist at
Nomura Securities International Inc.
   As for the economy in general, ``maybe it's not on the brink of
recession, but it's certainly not growing vigorously either,'' he
added.
   Mitchell Held, chief economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said the figures were especially encouraging in showing a
continued slowdown in the growth of service sector employment. That
sector had been particularly resistant to the Federal Reserve's
effort to slow the economy.
   What's more, average hourly earnings rose a mere 0.3 percent in
April, or 3 cents, to $9.95 an hour despite the 50 cent hike in the
minimum wage to $3.85 an hour.
   ``All those things together are really encouraging,'' Held said.
They should dispel worries that the Fed might have to engineer a
rise in interest rates to keep the economy and inflation in check.
   ``The Fed is probably going to keep policy steady,'' he
predicted.
   Manufacturers have reported greater price pressure for labor and
materials in the first quarter, as well as an increase in their
selling prices, said John D. Walter, economist for Dow Corning
Corp. and director of the National Association of Business
Economist's industry survey.
   Nevertheless, Walter said consumer sticker shock and restrained
growth in the money supply will cool inflation from the first
quarter pace, while strong capital spending is raising industry's
capacity.
   He sees the economy in a ``modest upturn'' with growth waffling
between 1 percent and 3 percent over the next year. In short, the
soft-landing scenario of restrained growth without recession is
still on track, Walter said.
   That would be good news for a market that has to digest the
Treasury's auctions of $30.5 billion in three- and 10-year notes
and 30-year bonds from Tuesday through Thursday. It's also good
news for the government.
   Resler estimates the employment report will enable the Treasury
to price the auctions at least an eighth of a percentage point
lower than it otherwise would have, say between 8~ percent and 9
percent for the long bond instead of 9-9&lsqb; percent.
   That would save $250 million over the life of the three issues _
``a nice little windfall for the Treasury.''
   Held says long-term bonds should settle into a trading range of
8{ percent to 9 percent, down from a widely perceived 8} percent to
9\ percent before Friday.

<HEAD>West German Union Reaches `Dream Goal' of 35-Hour Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's most powerful labor union
reached agreement Friday to cut its work week to 35 hours,
signalling a broad move toward more leisure time for workers in one
of the world's richest countries.
   Friday's pact, worked out during tense, all-night negotiations
with an employers organization, immediately affects about 700,000
factory workers in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
   The precedent is expected to be followed as the IG Metall
metalworkers union negotiates contracts for the rest of the country.
   West Germans already have six weeks of vacation each year, a
sprinkling of about 10 holidays and legally guaranteed work breaks
on the job.
   For years, the mighty IG Metall union, which negotiates
contracts for 4 million workers in the metal-working, automobile
and related industries, has demanded a reduction to 35 hours. The
current work week is 37 hours, compared with 40 hours in 1985.
   ``Our dream goal has been reached,'' said union president Franz
Steinkuehler in Frankfurt. ``We wanted time and money and we got
both.''
   The cut will come in two stages, to 36 hours in April 1993 and
35 hours in October 1995, while the agreement also calls for 6
percent pay hike spread out over 12 months.
   In Frankfurt, the printers union immediately said that it also
will be seeking to cut hours to 35 a week.
   ``I expect this compromise probably to be adopted nationwide,''
said Joerg Barzcynski, IG Metall spokesman.
   IG Metall had staged warning strikes involving more than 300,000
workers and temporarily halting production at a few hundred West
German plants this week.
   Steinkuehler promised a round of strikes to keep up pressure on
employers in other parts of the country to reach agreements.
   The compromise was reached in the key West German industrial
area around the city of Stuttgart, which houses car and truck
manufacturer Daimler-Benz, among other major companies.
   West German politicians reacted critically to the compromise.
Economics Minister Helmut Haussman termed it a ``false signal''
ahead of German unification.
   The unions ``are artifically restricting our most important
production factor,'' he said.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of the coalition partner Free Democrats,
called the accord on the 35-hour work week a ``speculative
agreement about the future.''
   West German employers' organizations repeatedly have said the
trend toward less work and higher pay, combined with the nation's
massive social security net, is driving more businesses to cheaper
countries in southern Europe.

<HEAD>TW Services Drops Pepsi-Cola From Hardee's, Canteen Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TW Services Inc., one of the nation's largest
food service companies, said Friday that it was dropping Pepsi-Cola
Co. products from its 465 Hardee's restaurants.
   Coca-Cola Co. had been the primary supplier for those
restaurants and will continue in that role, the Spartanburg,
S.C.-based company said.
   TW Services is the largest franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems
Inc., which owns or franchises 3,300 restaurants nationwide and
already counts Coca-Cola as its primary soft drink syrup supplier.
   As a Hardee's franchisee, TW Services was free to make its own
arrangements on soft drinks for its restaurants.
   Earlier this week, Burger King Corp. said it planned to switch
to Coca-Cola as the soft drink supplier for its 5,400 restaurants,
dumping Pepsi-Cola after an association of more than six years.
   Karen Randall, a spokeswoman for TW Services, said her company's
465 Hardee's restaurants have been offering several Coca-Cola
drinks along with the Pepsi brand and, in some cases, Pepsi's
Mountain Dew.
   But she said the company decided that consolidating its business
with Coca-Cola would improve operating efficiency.
   She declined to say how much business Pepsi-Cola stands to lose
as a result of the decision. The changeover will take several
months.
   TW Services said it also had designated Coca-Cola as the primary
supplier for its Canteen contract food service operations.
   The Canteen division has more than 1,600 accounts at sites
ranging from school cafeterias to industrial vending machines, some
of which had been serving Coca-Cola products along with other soft
drinks. The decision means Canteen will be offering Coca-Cola
products more often, the company said.

   Stock prices drifted aimlessly today, rendering
no clear verdict on a big surprise in the government's latest
report on employment.
   The 2 p.m. Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
2,696.17, unchanged from Thursday's close.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 794 up, 566 down and
532 unchanged.
   As the day began, the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point in
April to 5.4 percent.
   The figures also showed an increase of 64,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, far less than economists had been expecting.
   Analysts said the news abruptly dampened recent speculation that
the Federal Reserve might be planning to tighten credit in its
campaign against inflation. Interest rates fell in the credit
markets today.
   But stock traders did not take the news with unequivocal
enthusiasm. Brokers said it raised some fresh doubts about the
outlook for economic growth and corporate profits in the months
ahead.
   Among the blue chips, General Motors rose \ to 45&rsqb;;
International Business Machines gained 1&rsqb; to 109&rsqb;; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 40, and General Electric
lost \ to 64{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.40 to 184.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .13 at 344.84.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.99 million shares with two
hours to go.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat futures up
strongly, soybeans lower and corn narrowly mixed.
   The corn market's performance was surprising in light of strong
indications the Soviet Union bought up to 2 million metric tons of
U.S. corn overnight or early Friday, analysts said.
   They said buying linked to the Soviet rumors was offset by heavy
speculative fund selling.
   ``The fact that corn closed mixed against all that selling is
good'' from a bullish perspective, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The fact that we couldn't rally
corn more than we did is bad.''
   Soybean futures extended the fairly steep losses posted
Thursday, obliterating strong gains made in Wednesday's session.
   Wheat futures surged late in the session, possibly reflecting
concerns about flood-related harvest delays and damage to the
winter wheat crop in eastern Texas and Oklahoma.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 4{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.77 a bushel; corn futures
were } cent lower to 1} cents higher with May at $2.87\ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to { cent higher with May at $1.66} a

<HEAD>Ames Chief To Get $8 Million Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of Ames Department Stores
Inc. could receive $8 million over three years if he can steer the
troubled retailer through bankruptcy court, according to his
contract.
   In addition to a $1.5 million annual salary and $500,000 signing
bonus, chief executive Stephen L. Pistner will will receive a $3.5
million bonus if Ames wins court approval for a reorganization plan
before Nov. 1, 1991.
   He would get a bonus of $3 million if the court approves a plan
after Nov. 1, 1991, according to the contract, filed this week in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   The Rocky Hill-based discount chain sought protection from
creditors last week under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Pistner's base pay is more than double the salary of Ames' last
chief executive officer, Peter B. Hollis, who resigned effective
Monday.
   In granting preliminary approval to Pistner's hiring, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III agreed the company had to
pay a generous salary to attract an executive willing to take on
the job of rescuing Ames, a $5 billion company.
   Pistner _ the former chief of the Montgomery Ward, McCrory,
Target and Dayton Hudson retail chains _ has more than 20 years of
experience in retail management and a reputation for reviving
troubled companies.
   A May 15 bankruptcy court hearing was scheduled to finalize the
appointment.
   Ames said in court papers that its deal with Pistner was similar
to compensation another troubled retailer, Allied Stores Corp.,
offered its new chief executive officer.
   Allied, the parent of the Bloomingdale's and Jordan Marsh store
chains, filed for Chapter 11 protection in January.
   Pistner will receive his base salary and other benefits and
expenses regardless of whether Ames emerges from bankruptcy court
proceedings.

<HEAD>Two Directors Resign at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two key directors of the troubled advertising and
consulting giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC resigned Friday, the
company said.
   Roy Warman and Terry Bannister served as joint chief operating
officers of Saatchi's communications division with responsibility
for worldwide advertising operations.
   Saatchi's deputy chairman Jeremy Sinclair was named to replace
the men.
   The departures of Warman, 41, and Bannister, 44, are the first
major executive departures since January when Robert Louis-Dreyfus
was brought in as chief executive.
   Warman was a founding member of Saatchi's executive team,
joining the firm at its beginning in 1970. Terry Bannister had been
with the London-based company for 17 years.
   Louis-Dreyfus issued a brief statement, in which he said, ``I am
sorry to see them go, but following the decision to redeploy as
much of the central talent as possible within the operations, no
role could be found for Roy and Terry which satisfied them.''
   The company has been battered by an expensive diversification
into consulting during the mid-1980s, weak financial controls and a
period of slow growth in the advertising industry.
   Louis-Dreyfus, the Harvard MBA who turned around IMS
International Inc., the New York-based pharmaceutical market
research firm, has introduced cost-cutting measures and is trying
to sell Saatchi's consulting businesses.
   A Saatchi spokesman said Friday's departures weren't totally
unexpected.
   ``It's (the result) of a corporate decision by the chief
executive. That's the chief executive's job,'' said the spokesman,
who was not named in keeping with British custom.
   The spokesman added that Warman and Bannister have four-year
contracts and may leave with 1 million pounds, or $1.64 million,
each.
   Sinclair, 43, another founding member of the firm, has been
chairman of Saatchi's international advertising operations since
1986, and the group's deputy chairman since 1987.

   Trade ministers from three continents
reported today they had failed to resolve several disputes that are
threatening to scuttle an ambitious effort to reform the global
trading system.
   Officials from the United States, Japan, the 12-nation European
Community and Canada said at the conclusion of three days of talks
that they had a frank exchange of views but remained far apart in
many areas, especially on the contentious issue of how to end
expensive farm subsidies.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the talks were in the
``home stretch,'' but she conceded that much work needed to be done.
   The ministers did report some progress on bridging differences
on some low-level issues such as how trade disputes should be
handled but said sharp differences remained in the two key areas of
agriculture subsidies and barriers to textile imports.
   Hills spoke at a sun-drenched news conference held on the edge
of a golf course at the resort where the talks were held.
   The Bush administration is counting on an agreement by the end
of this year to lower America's huge trade deficit by expanding
export opportunities for U.S. farmers and businesses.
   The American side is pushing to eliminate expensive farm export
subsidies, to dismantle barriers to trade in services such as
banking and to crack down on copyright and patent piracy, estimated
to cost American firms $60 billion annually.
   Officials said they aim to draw up the general outline of an
agreement during a bargaining session in Geneva in late July, and
then work toward a final agreement in December.
   The talks, held under the auspices of the 97-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, are known as the Uruguay
Round of free trade talks, for the country where they were launched
in 1986.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, who selected her home
state of California for the meeting, expressed satisfaction with
what she termed a ``quite constructive'' session.
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the talks produced no major breakthroughs, although
he said they helped define the opposing positions.
   All sides reported that the biggest dispute _ how to put an end
to trade-distorting farm subsidies _ remained far from resolution
as the European Community held fast to its desire to protect a
subsidy system for its network of small farms.
   Frans Andriessen, trade minister for the European Community,
termed the discussions ``frank,'' often a diplomatic code word for
unfruitful talks.
   Many Third World nations, who were not represented at the Napa
meetings, are battling the U.S. proposals, especially on lowering
trade barriers for service industries. They contend that their
fledgling service companies should be protected from foreign
concerns invading their markets.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said he would put the
chances of successfully wrapping up the negotiations in December at
little better than 50 percent.
   But he said he was still hopeful because ``the consequences of
failure are so horrific. ... The alternative is the law of the
jungle and only the largest beasts will survive and they won't
survive very well.''
   Hills sounded a similar theme, contending that without a
strengthened trade agreement, both industrial and Third World
nations would suffer declining standards of living as trade flows
contracted behind protectionist walls.
   The administration is having to wage a dual war, seeking to
convince the Europeans and developing countries to drop their
opposition to the free trade proposals while fighting off efforts
in Congress to erect barriers protecting threatened U.S. industries.
   Congress must approve any final agreement and the outcome of
that debate is far from certain. Already, special interest groups
representing the textile industry and peanut and sugar growers are
working to build congressional opposition to changes in GATT rules
that would strip them of trade protections they now enjoy.

<HEAD>Shareholders Back Plea To Allow Non-White Shirts; Company Doesnt'</HEAD>

   Shareholders at Safeco Corp.'s annual meeting
didn't show much reaction to disappointing first-quarter profits,
but they applauded a plea to allow male employees to wear non-white
shirts.
   ``For 28 long years, I have been needlessly white,'' Jack
Hepfer, a recently retired Safeco lawyer, said of the 67-year-old
dress code.
   Hepfer cited Hawthorne Dent, founder of the Seattle-based
insurance company, as having said in 1955 that there was ``nothing
the matter with colored shirts.'' After all, Hepfer said, ``The
Berlin Wall came down.''
   But the white-shirts-only policy didn't.
   Safeco Chairman Bruce Maines defended the rule at Wednesday's
annual meeting and company president Roger Eigsti refused to change
it.
   ``The white-shirt rule is a plain, straight, pragmatic rule.
It's a part of our thing. It's part of our personality,'' said
Maines, who owns 30 white shirts.
   The company reported first-uarter profits of 89 cents a share,
down from $1.04 a share in the first three months of 1989.

<HEAD>Whittle Names Turner Broadcasting Exec To Head New Education
Division</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications said Friday it is
consolidating its media systems designed for schools into one
division and named a former executive of Turner Broadcasting
Systems Inc. to head the new unit.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company said it expects its new
Whittle Educational Network division to generate annual revenue of
$125 million by 1991, making it one of the company's largest
operations.
   Whittle officials expect the company overall to generate more
than $300 million a year in revenue by 1991, up from about $180
million this year. Whittle is 50 percent owned by Time Warner Inc.
   The new division will contain at least seven different media
properties ranging from TV programs and magazines for teens to
product sampling programs aimed at college students. Responsibility
for each property previously had been scattered throughout the
company.
   One source familiar with Whittle's plans said additional
business divisions are expected to be formed within the company
over the next few months. One of them could handle all of the
company's health programs, for instance, or all of its
foreign-language programs.
   Farrell Reynolds, former president of Turner Broadcasting Sales
Inc., was named chairman and chief executive of the new division.
Longtime Whittle executive Ed Winter will be president and chief
operating officer of the unit.
   At Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting, Reynold's division was
responsible for advertising sales on the Turner networks including
Cable News Network, Turner Network Television, Headline News and
the TBS Superstation.
   Falling under his jurisdiction at Whittle will be Channel One,
the 12-minute daily television news show with commercials for teens
in the classroom. Channel One was launched in March and has signed
up 3,600 schools nationally.
   Winter has been responsible for getting the Channel One system
going.
   By turning to Turner Broadcasting for the chief executive of its
educational unit, Whittle raided one of its chief competitors in
educational broadcasting.
   Turner's Cable News Network launched a commercial-free 15-minute
daily news show for teens last summer and encourages teachers to
use it in class.
   Along with Channel One, the new Whittle Educational Network
division will have responsibility for six other media systems aimed
at schools.
   They are The Classroom Channel, a noncommercial educational
program; the wall media systems Connections, Big Picture and Campus
Voice, which combine editorial material and advertisements on a
poster-size billboard hung in school lobbies; the magazine Go! for
teen girls and Good Stuff, a sampling program.
   Whittle offers more than 40 media properties, many of them
designed to appeal to narrowly defined audiences such as mothers in
waiting rooms, pet owners at the veterinarians or Hispanic
households.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Prices Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Friday against all major
currencies except the Japanese yen after the government said the
U.S. unemployment rate for April rose to its highest level in more
than a year.
   Gold prices softened. Gold fell 50 cents a troy ounce to $370.90
on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $371.30 an ounce, unchanged from Thursday.
   The government said the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 5.4
percent in April from 5.2 percent in March.
   ``That seemed to be what set it off,'' Mike Ballow, a currency
market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said of the dollar's
decline.
   Signs of economic weakness, such as higher unemployment, may
induce the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates. Lower rates
reduce the attractiveness of returns on dollar-denominated
investments, compared with those for other currencies.
   ``Right now, people (traders) only are concentrating on interest
rates,'' said Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp;
Co. in New York.
   Also working against the dollar was a rise in bond prices, which
sent bond yields lower, Simon said.
   In addition, traders said the dollar's fall was hastened when
its price crossed certain technical support levels in relation to
other currencies.
   Markets in Japan were closed for the Citizens' Day holiday. In
London, the dollar traded at 158.25 yen, up from 158.10 yen late
Thursday. In New York, the dollar bought 158.30 yen, up from 158.05
yen a day earlier.
   In London, the British pound moved higher, rising to $1.6595
from $1.6425 late Thursday. In New York, the pound cost $1.6635,
more expensive than Thursday's $1.6410.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6660 West German marks, down from 1.6828;
1.4430 Swiss francs, down from 1.4550; 5.5930 French francs, down
from 5.6450; 1,221 Italian lire, down from 1,233.25; and 1.1629
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16625.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6710 West German marks, down from 1.6817; 1.4435
Swiss francs, down from 1.4540; 5.6060 French francs, down from
5.6315; 1.8782 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910; 1,224.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,232.50; and 1.1630 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1669.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $371.45 a troy ounce, from
$370.65 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold closed at $371.00 an
ounce, up from $370.25 bid late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to close at a bid of
$372.76 an ounce.
   Silver for current delivery rose to $5.00 a troy ounce from
$4.998 late Thursday on the Commodity Exchange. Earlier, silver
bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.05 a troy ounce, from
$5.04 bid late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices closed mixed on seasonal
and technical factors Friday, a day after OPEC members agreed to
cut their production by about 6 percent.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, fell 1 cent to close at $17.98 a 42-gallon barrel.
Subsequent contract months posted small gains.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, home heating oil for June delivery dropped 0.05 cent to
49.95 cents a gallon. The July and August contracts also fell, but
subsequent months edged higher.
   The June contract for unleaded regular gasoline rose 1.44 cents
to 61.12 cents a gallon, and later-month contracts also advanced.
   Natural gas for June delivery finished unchanged at $1.575 per
million British thermal units, as it did the previous two sessions.
   Analysts said traders largely were squaring their positions.
   Gasoline advanced as the summer driving season approached and
amid reports of shortages on the Gulf Coast. Heating oil's decline
was attributed to reduced demand during the spring and summer.
   On Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
announced it was cutting its production by 1.45 million barrels a
day from 23.5 million barrels in April. The cartel's overproduction
has brought oil prices down by 20 percent since January.
   Futures prices rallied briefly and then sank after the
announcement Thursday because traders did not believe the cuts were
substantial enough to relieve the glut of oil on world markets.
   The agreement had little effect on Friday's trading, analysts
said.

<HEAD>State Agency Investigating Trump's Atlantic City Casinos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's three casinos are
being investigated in a financial review that state officials said
Friday was routine and had nothing to do with disgruntled
contractors or the Manhattan developer's desire to sell some assets.
   Anthony J. Parrillo, director of the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said the review has been under way for two months.
Such reviews are done periodically for each casino operator in
Atlantic City, he said.
   Parrillo's division is the investigative arm of the state Casino
Control Commission, which oversees the gaming industry.
   Parrillo said it was coincidental that the review coincided with
statements from Trump last week that he was considering selling
some of his holdings, which include Manhattan real estate and the
Trump Shuttle airline.
   Also, a story published in Forbes last week lowered estimates of
Trump's wealth by more than $1 billion to about $500 million, but
Parrillo said that also was no factor.
   ``The information will not cloud our vision either negatively or
positively,'' Parrillo said. ``It's based solely on the facts, not
on estimates by Forbes or in the print media.''
   Parrillo said his office has yet to receive a formal complaint
from about 100 contractors who contend they are owed about $35
million for work on Trump's $1 billion Taj Mahal Casino Resort,
which opened April 2. Any such complaint would be investigated, he
said.
   Trump officials announced Thursday they hired an independent
auditor to check the contractors' work before making final payment.
   Parrillo said he could not estimate how long the state review
would take. He said past investigations of Trump's finances
occurred when he first got his license in 1982, again in 1983 and
in 1987.
   He said the review may include Trump's entire organization,
including properties outside Atlantic City.
   The division produced a favorable financial report on the Taj
Mahal's prospects before it officially won its license March 29.
   Ed Tracy, president of Trump's Atlantic City holdings, said the
review is a ``non-issue'' because it is required periodically by
state law.
   Last month, the Taj Mahal set an Atlantic City record, taking in
$34.2 million from gamblers.
   Trump's other two casinos both saw drops in gross revenues last
month, though both were hurt by unusually low ``hold'' percentages.
Hold is what is kept by the house and is subject to the luck of
gambling.
   Trump Plaza dropped from $26.6 million in April 1989 to $20.3
million last month. Trump Castle fell from $21.0 million to $18.5
million.
   ``We're doing great. The numbers at the Taj continue to be
astounding,'' Tracy said. ``The numbers at Trump Plaza and Trump
Castle were down but not significantly in terms of market share.''
   Ron Grobeck, a gaming analyst with New York-based R.D. Smith,
said Trump Plaza remains a strong property, but questioned the Taj
Mahal's long-term potential for taking business away from Trump
Castle.
   He also said the $34.2 million first-month figure for the Taj
Mahal was not as good as might be expected given the ``hyped-up
atmosphere.''
   ``The Taj may not be as strong as Donald would have hoped,''
Grobeck said.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Collapse on Slack Demand, Technical Weakness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices collapsed Friday, plunging more than a
penny a pound on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid
heavy selling by frustrated speculators on signs of slack global
demand.
   On other commodity markets, cocoa futures also fell sharply;
copper futures retreated; precious metals were mostly lower; oil
futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   World sugar futures settled .50 cent to 1.16 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in July at 14.44 cents a pound, the
lowest close for a near-month sugar contract since March 1.
   ``Everybody was bailing out of the market today,'' Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. analyst Judith Ganes said.
   She said the market had been poised for a fall after repeated
failures in the past week to sustain prices above 16 cents a pound.
   Speculators who had been holding out for higher prices finally
gave up and began liquidating their positions, analysts said,
triggering a sell-off of near-record proportions with an estimated
76,000 contracts changing hands.
   The decline was spurred on by a bearish supply-demand report by
the London trading house E.D.&amp;F. Man Ltd. The firm sharply reduced
its 1989-90 sugar deficit estimate, predicting consumption would
outstrip production by 258,000 metric tons instead of 1.46 million
metric tons as previously forecast.
   Ms. Ganes said the Man report probably contributed to the
bearish sentiment but that the revised deficit forecast was in line
with other trade house predictions.
   She said the sharp rise in sugar prices from less than 13 cents
a pound last December has stifled demand, which is the reason for
the lowered consumption expectations.
   But Monday's sharp decline could stimulate new demand, Ms. Ganes
said.
   Cocoa futures also fell sharply in New York amid skepticism
about a plan by six major producer countries to curb excess
production and encourage local consumption.
   Cocoa futures settled $23 to $29 lower with May at $1,261 per
ton.
   Near-month copper futures fell modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange on news that employees of the Southern Peru Copper Corp.
had returned to work, ending a seven-week strike that had disrupted
Peruvian copper shipments.
   Copper settled 1.3 cents lower to .55 cents higher with May at
$1.189 a pound.
   Also on the Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 60 cents to
$1.30 lower with June at $373.10 a troy ounce; silver was 0.9 cent
lower to 0.2 cent higher with May at $5 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures were little changed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange but near-month gasoline futures rose sharply, erasing
Thursday's loss.
   The oil market is adjusting to OPEC's decision this week to
reduce crude-oil production in an attempt to alleviate a global
supply glut.
   World demand for oil is running about the same as last year,
said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser for Josephthal &amp; Co.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 12
cents higher with June at $17.98 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent
lower to .29 cent higher with June at 49.95 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to 1.44 cents higher with June at
61.12 cents a pound.
   After the close of grain and soybean futures trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the Agriculture Department announced the
Soviet Union had bought 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn, partly
confirming market rumors that the Soviets had bought as much as 2
million tons.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 4} cents higher with May at
$3.77\ a bushel; corn futures were } cent lower to 1} cents higher
with May at $2.87\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to { cent
higher with May at $1.66} a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 3}
cents lower with May at $6.26{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures finished
.40 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at 74.65 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .18 cent higher with May at
83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .43 cent
higher with June at 63.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 69.17 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Prices Rise in Big Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New evidence from April employment figures of an
unexpectedly weak economy triggered a furious rally Friday in the
bond market, sending interest rates sharply lower.
   The bond buying binge offered a marked contrast to the gloom
that depressed the market for much of the month of April, hammering
bond prices and pushing long-term interest rates bove 9 percent for
the first time since last May.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 1| points, or
$16.25 for every $1,000 face amount, in one of the year's biggest
rallies.
   Its yield, which falls when prices rise, tumbled to 8.81 percent
from 8.97 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the government's report that the unemployment rate
rose to 5.4 percent in April from 5.2 percent in March was the
catalyst for the big price rally.
   What caught most bond traders' interest was the report of a
measly net gain of 64,000 jobs in April, well below what analysts
had expected.
   Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said if the addition of 78,000
temporary census workers were excluded from the numbers, jobs would
have fallen by 14,000 last month. He said analysts expected an
increase of 150,000 jobs, not counting the census workers for April.
   In addition, he said wage inflation was up 0.3 percent in April
when many analysts were expecting 0.5 percent growth, partly due to
the April 1 boost in the minimum wage. But the minimum wage
increase had minimal impact on overall wage growth, officials
indicated.
   ``This report indicates a lot of weakness in the economy. People
had thought the economy was stronger with a much deeper inflation
problem,'' Platt said.
   The bond market benefits from a slow economic growth and low
inflation because credit demand generally falls off during sluggish
periods and allows interest rates to decline.
   Rising inflation and rapid growth, on the other hand, erodes the
value of fixed-income securities such as notes and bonds and could
prompt the Federal Reserve to encourage higher interest rates.
   ``There is nothing the bond market likes better than bad news,''
said Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities
International.
   He said the bond market had overreacted over the past few months
to indications that the economy was growing rapidly and inflation
was accelerating.
   The market rally could not have been timed any better for the
Treasury Department, which is planning to sell $30.5 billion in new
securities next week. Barring a sudden reversal in market sentiment
early next week, the government may find buyers at lower yields
than had been expected only a few days ago.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose { point, intermediate maturities climbed by
between 11-16 point and a full point and long-term issues advanced
1| points, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 9.15 to 1,140.76.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds climbed 7-16 point to 89|. The average yield
to maturity fell to 7.68 percent from 7.72 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.00 percent as the
discount lost 10 basis points to 7.75 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.23 percent as the discount dropped 16 basis points
to 7.81 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.39 percent as
the discount fell 22 basis points to 7.82 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

   Trade ministers representing the largest
industrial countries reported Friday they had failed to resolve
major disputes blocking an ambitious effort to overhaul the global
trading system.
   Speaking at the end of a three-day negotiating session,
officials of the United States, Japan, the 12-nation European
Community and Canada said sharp differences still remained over
such issues as a U.S. demand for the elimination of costly
agricultural barriers.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and the leaders of the
other delegations sought to portray the talks in a positive light,
saying the discussions were useful in highlighting areas of
disagreement and providing momentum to resolving disputes.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie praised the discussions for
``turning the heat up'' in the four-year effort to liberalize the
rules governing world trade.
   The officials said progress has been made toward narrowing
differences in certain lower-level issues such as how trade
disputes are handled.
   But they were unable to point to any breakthroughs in the major
areas of dispute, including agriculture and barriers erected by the
United States and other industrial countries to textile imports.
   With time running out on the four-year effort to reform the
global trading system, Hills said the negotiators would appeal to
President Bush and other leaders at the seven-nation economic
summit in July to supply a ``political push'' to break the
stalemates.
   Hills and Crosbie participated at the closing press conference
with Japanese Trade Minister Kabun Muto and Frans Andriessen, top
trade negotiator for the European Community.
   They spoke to reporters on the patio of a posh resort in the
heart of California wine country, a site selected by Hills, a
California native.
   The talks were intended to provide guidance so that lower level
negotiators would be able to come up with at least the outline of a
final agreement during talks scheduled for late July in Geneva.
   Hills said she remained confident that with intensive effort
such a document could be produced in coming weeks.
   The Bush administration has made a successful conclusion of the
complex negotiations, which are scheduled to end in December, its
No. 1 trade priority.
   The administration believes the freer trade that would result
would lower America's huge trade deficit by expanding overseas
sales by American farmers and businesses.
   U.S. negotiators are pushing to eliminate all trade-distorting
farm subsidies, to dismantle barriers to trade in services such as
banking and to crack down on copyright and patent piracy, estimated
to cost American firms $60 billion annually.
   The talks, being held under the auspices of the 97-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are known as the Uruguay
Round, for the country where they were launched in 1986.
   The United States has proposed a 10-year phaseout of the farm
subsidies, estimating it would boost exports for more efficient
American farmers by $11 billion annually.
   But the European Community, seeking to protect its wide network
of small family farms, has refused to budge from its opposition.
   Many Third World nations, which were not represented at the Napa
meetings, are battling the U.S. proposals to lower trade barriers
on services and to toughen copyright protections, fearing harm to

   Congress must approve any final agreement and the debate there
is likely to be intense.
   Already, special interest groups representing the American
textile industry and peanut and sugar growers are working to build
opposition to changes which would strip them of trade protections

<HEAD>GM To Ask Employees To Talk Up Car Quality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Friday it has begun a
campaign to boost the image of its cars and trucks that includes
asking current and retired employees to tell their friends that
vehicle quality has improved.
   GM spokesman Harold Jackson said the advertising project is the
automaker's most ambitious ever. He declined to say how much GM is
spending, but The Wall Street Journal estimated Friday it would
cost $40 million.
   The nation's Big Three automakers have stumbled badly in a
industrywide downturn due to soft markets and intense foreign
competition.
   GM on Thursday reported that first-quarter profits fell by 54
percent. Earnings declined 69 percent at Ford Motor Co. in the
first quarter and 80 percent at Chrysler Corp.
   GM said it plans to contact each of its estimated 500,000 active
U.S. employees, its 330,000 retirees and employees of its 9,700
U.S. dealers and urge them to tell friends and neighbors that GM's
vehicle quality has improved.
   ``We're particularly concerned that people who haven't driven
our recent cars are still judging us by the vehicles they bought in
the early '80s, some of which perhaps weren't quite as high in
quality as they are today,'' Jackson said.
   Chrysler has been airing a television commercial featuring its
chairman, Lee Iacocca, telling top executives basically the same
thing _ that the quality of the company's cars has improved, but no
one knows it.
   ``Ours is not tied to Iacocca,'' Jackson said. ``Ours has been
in the development stage since late last year.''
   The GM program includes television, magazine and newspaper
advertising, some of which began Friday, along with the individual
mailings, which started earlier this week.
   Jackson said the program has no scheduled end.

   Congressional testimony by convicted junk bond
financier Michael Milken before he is sentenced could complicate
the securities fraud case, the nation's top securities regulator
said Friday.
   The oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously Tuesday to subpoena
Milken, who pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay $600
million in penalties last month.
   If Milken receives immunity from the panel, nothing he says at a
congressional hearing could be used against him in state or federal
courts.
   ``I think we'll try to work with Congress to make sure they
understand the status of the case as they consider what hearings
they wish to have and when they want to have them,'' Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden said.
   Before Milken is called to testify before Congress _ something
he refused to do two years ago _ the subpoena must be approved by
the full House committee.
   Milken, once head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-risk,
high-yield bond department, faces up to 28 years in prison when he
is sentenced in New York on Oct. 1.
   Asked if the SEC would oppose having Milken testify before he is
sentenced, Breeden said:
   ``If you had immunized testimony before a point in time that the
plea agreement, and the settlement becomes irrevocable on the date
of sentencing, then it does create potential for introducing
complications into the case.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the committee and
subcomittee, replied in a statement issued through his office:
``We're aware of the concerns of the SEC and others and will work
closely with them to avoid major complications. However, the
subcommittee intends to continue to perform its duties and
oversight with vigor.''
   On other topics, Breeden said it was ``premature'' to say how an
appeals court decision in New York this week overturning the
insider trading conviction of ex-stockbroker Robert Chestman would
affect SEC enforcement efforts.
   He added that the SEC was still studying the decision to
determine whether to appeal it and what implications it has for
pending cases and settlements already reached.
   ``We're certainly not get into renegotiating settlements at a
preliminary stage,'' Breeden said during a meeting with reporters
in his office.
   In settling civil and criminal charges with the SEC and the
Justice Department, Milken agreed to testify truthfully before
grand juries and at trials or court proceedings stemming from ``any
Drexel-related activities.''
   If Milken fails to comply with those rules he can be prosecuted
for perjury and obstruction of justice and jailed for contempt of
court under the settlement. The agreements do not specifically
mention congressional testimony.

   Greyhound Lines Inc. said Friday it lost $55.8
million in the first quarter and would miss millions of dollars in
payments due in coming weeks because of problems related to a
2-month-old strike by bus drivers.
   Greyhound said it missed about $5 million in lease payments due
in April and would not make a $9.75 million interest payment due
May 15. Greyhound also announced layoffs of 172 administrative
workers at its Dallas headquarters and elsewhere.
   The losses put Greyhound in technical default on some credit
agreements, opening the door for creditors to force the company
into bankruptcy. Officials say they do not believe that will happen.
   ``We won't pull the rip cord if nobody forces us to,'' Greyhound
Vice President and Treasurer Don Seaquist said. ``Our assets have a
lot more value as a going operation as a bus company that they
would broken up.''
   He said Greyhound's senior bank lenders were getting daily
reports on company operations and cash flow and were expected to
grant waivers on some interest payment requirements.
   The disclosures were the first indication of financial straits
at Greyhound, which operates the only nationwide bus system.
Greyhound blamed the losses and cutbacks in large part on $20
million in unanticipated expenses to cope with strike-related
violence.
   Greyhound had maintained since bus drivers walked out March 2
that it had sufficient cash to withstand the strike and would make
the May 15 interest payment.
   ``At the time, our cash projections showed a return to ridership
that was higher than we've seen so far,'' Seaquist said.
   The company has been running at between 53 percent and 60
percent of last year's ridership in recent weeks, although
spokesman George Gravley said the latest figures show an
improvement.
   Greyhound said it is taking ``vigorous actions to return to
profitability during the peak summer months.'' But the company said
it expects to lose money in April, May and possibly June.
   The actions include the layoffs announced Friday and a new
advertising campaign to take effect next week. Greyhound already
laid off about 270 mechanics last month.
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Greyhound said the first-quarter loss caused it to violate certain
agreements with creditors.
   ``As a result, the company's major creditors will be in a
position to accelerate payments due,'' Greyhound said. ``The
company is developing a financial restructuring plan that it will
begin discussing with its creditors and lenders in the very near
future.''
   Seaquist admitted the creditors could force Greyhound into
involuntary bankruptcy, and that the company had briefly
considered, but rejected, filing for voluntary bankruptcy.
   Although Greyhound said it had been prepared financially for the
strike, it said it had not anticipated ``the excessive amount of
violence directed at its buses and facilities.''
   ``Violence caused the company to spend more than $20 million for
additional security, legal fees and driver training,'' Greyhound
said.
   There have been 46 shootings at Greyhound buses or terminals and
more than 100 bomb threats, the company said. The company has sued
union officials in a Florida federal court for $30 million,
claiming they have supported violence.
   Greyhound had refused to return to the bargaining table until a
week had passed without violence. That condition was met earlier
this week, and talks are to resume in Washington on Saturday with a
federal mediator.
   Gravley said the company would have no new proposal to present
Saturday.
   Greyhound has said it cannot afford more than the $63 million,
three-year contract it first offered. Union officials contend their
own offer is less, but Greyhound values it at about $200 million.
   In the quarter ended March 31, Greyhound said it lost $55.8
million on revenues of $173 million. That compares to a $14.4
million loss on $224 million in revenue during the same period last
year.
   The company, created three years ago in a leveraged buyout, lost
$20 million its first two years before turning a small profit last
year.

   A computer expert who created a ``worm''
program that paralyzed thousands of computers nationwide was placed
on three years probation Friday and fined $10,000 for the crime.
   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson also ordered 25-year-old
Robert T. Morris to perform 400 hours of community service.
   Prosecutors had asked Munson to order the maximum sentence of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. They sought at least some
jail time for the former Cornell University graduate student.
   Defense attorney David O'Brien said Morris was ``too decent a
kid'' to be sentenced to jail.
   ``There is a world of difference between what Robert did and
what others who have used this technology did,'' O'Brien said,
noting that Morris did not benefit from his actions.
   Morris did not speak at the sentencing or talk to reporters
after the hearing. He remained grim-faced through most of the
hearing, then cracked a wide smile and hugged his mother when the
sentence was announced.
   Morris' parents said they were pleased with the sentence.
   ``We love our son, he's a great kid,'' Anne Morris said. ``We
wish that this last year and a half had been different for him, but
we're weathering it and so is he.''
   Mrs. Morris said the experience had made her son more
responsible.
   In January, Morris became the first person to be convicted under
the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for breaking into a federal
computer network and preventing authorized use of the system.
   He created the ``worm'' program while at Cornell University in
Ithaca on Nov. 2, 1988. The rogue program immobilized an estimated
6,000 computers linked to the Internet research system, including
ones at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, military
bases and major universities.
   Morris, formerly of Arnold, Md., and now living in Cambridge,
Mass., testified during his trial that the worm was an experiment
that went out of control because of a programming error he made. He
admitted he designed the worm to invade the Internet system, but
said it wasn't supposed to replicate wildly as it did.
   Prosecutors disagreed. During the trial, they described Morris'
experiment as a ``full-scale assault'' that was methodically
planned. They said Morris also took deliberate steps to make the
worm difficult to trace and eradicate.
   U.S. Attorney Frederick Scullin Jr., however, said he thought
the sentence was fair. The case was unique, and the sentence does
not mean that future offenders will not face prison terms, he said.
   ``In case anybody had any doubt, these are serious crimes and
will be prosecuted as such,'' Scullin said.
   Thomas Guidoboni, another defense attorney, said he thought the
sentence was reasonable, but said he will file an appeal to
challenge the law under which Morris was convicted.
   ``I don't believe Mr. Morris deserves to be a felon for what he
did,'' said Guidoboni, who had asked Munson to consider a sentence
of no more than six months in jail and a $500-$5,000 fine.

   Stock prices capped off a week of slow but
steady gains with a broad advance Friday, responding to a big
surprise in the government's latest report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.19 to 2,710.36,
stretching its gain for the week to 65.31 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by better than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,020 up, 465 down and 480 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.55 million
shares, against 145.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.14 million shares.
   As the day began, the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point in
April to 5.4 percent.
   The figures also showed an increase of 64,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, far less than economists had been expecting.
   Analysts said the news abruptly dampened recent speculation that
the Federal Reserve might be planning to tighten credit in its
campaign against inflation. Interest rates fell sharply in the
credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $15 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.82
percent-8.86 percent. Just a few days earlier, Treasury bond rates
surpassed 9 percent for the first time in nearly a year.
   But stock traders did not take the news with unequivocal
enthusiasm. Brokers said it raised some fresh doubts about the
outlook for economic growth and corporate profits in the months
ahead.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines climbed 2{
to 110{; General Motors | to 45}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph &rsqb;
to 40&rsqb;, and American Express &rsqb; to 26~.
   Financial and utility stocks were notable gainers, benefiting
especially from the sudden shift in view of the interest-rate
outlook.
   In the financial sector, for example, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
rose 2&lsqb; to 66| and Federal National Mortgage was up 1&lsqb; at 34~.
   Dow Jones's average of 15 utility stocks climbed 2.27 to 208.38,
for a 1.10 percent gain that more than doubled the percentage rise
of the industrial average.
   Texas Utilities, up { at 35&rsqb;, and Panhandle Eastern, up { at
26&rsqb;, both made the active list.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $23.38 billion, or
0.73 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.40 to 185.37.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.08 to 394.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.82 at 338.39.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
3.17 to 428.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 345.73, up .76.

government said.
   Friday's report triggered a huge rally in bond prices that sent

<HEAD>Thrift Reports $293 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association said
Friday it lost $293 million in the first quarter, as the value of
its junk bond portfolio declined by $274 million.
   But Edward G. Harshfield, Columbia's president and chief
executive, said the thrift had received several bids to purchase
``substantially all'' of its $3 billion junk bond portfolio in a
single transaction.
   The quarterly loss, equal to $14.62 per share, contrasted with a
profit of $7.9 million, or 20 cents per share, in the same 1989
period.
   Columbia had bought more high-yield, high-risk junk bonds than
any other thrift, in large part due to close ties with convicted
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier Michael Milken, whose junk
bond network involved major thrifts.
   Columbia said that as of March 31 it was $338 million short of
federal requirements for minimum capital.
   The thrift said it had sold or redeemed $254 million in
high-yield bonds and preferred stock and $19.5 million of equity
and equity-equivalent securities.
   Columbia said its financial adviser, First Boston Corp., had
received several bids to purchase nearly the entire portfolio of
junk bonds. The bids are being discussed by Columbia, First Boston
and the potential buyers, the thrift said.
   Harshfield described the thrift's relationship with regulators
as ``positive, constructive'' as the thrift tries to sell of its
junk bond portfolio.
   ``We are also encouraged by the wide interest in the high-yield
portfolio that First Boston has received so far, and have a greater
degree of confidence that a favorable transaction can occur,'' he
said.
   Columbia's junk bond portfolio was worth $4.3 billion at the end
of 1988, and has declined in large part because of the sharp
decline in the high-yield bond market that began last fall due to
several prominent defaults.
   The thrift has been forced to carry the junk portfolio on its
books at market value because of accounting changes required under
the government's bailout program for the nation's saving and loan
insurance fund.
   Columbia is seeking to unload the portfolio to meet net capital
requirements for insurance. The thrift is expected to receive a
better price if it can sell the portfolio whole rather than
piecemeal.
   Junk bonds are a form of debt security that offer high yields in
exchange for their perceived high risk. Thrifts in the 1980s bought
billions of dollars in the bonds, which were used to finance small
companies and hostile takeovers. Columbia also said it set aside
$192.7 million for credit loss reserves _ which reflects the
declined junk bond portfolio _ earlier in the quarter when it
announced it was insolvent. The thrift's accounting loss from the
reserve for the quarter was $80.9 million.
   Due to the first-quarter loss, Columbia had a stockholders'
deficit of $215.6 million, compared with shareholders' equity of
$77.6 million as of Dec. 31.
   Columbia said its net interest income fell to $12.7 million from
$60.2 million.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. and sister
Allied Stores Corp. posted net losses totaling more than $2.1
billion in their fourth fiscal quarters, largely because of a
write-down stemming from their bankruptcy reorganization.
   The companies, which own nearly 260 U.S. department stores such
as Bloomingdale's, Rich's and Lazarus, also reported that excluding
non-operating charges, they posted operating profits for both the
fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended Feb. 3.
   ``I believe we have turned the corner on stabilizing the
business, and that we are well into a period of operational
recovery,'' chairman Allen Questrom said in a prepared statement.
   Separately, the companies' parent Campeau Corp. said it had
proposed a business plan to its bondholders that includes the sale
of real estate assets and a temporary halt in its interest payments.
   Federated and Allied sought federal bankruptcy court protection
from creditors on Jan. 15, citing the burden of paying off $7.7
billion in debt. Much of the debt was incurred when Campeau
acquired the companies, Federated in 1988 and Allied in 1986,
largely with borrowed funds.
   Worsening the companies' condition was a sluggish retailing
environment, which forced price-cutting and other competitive moves
that cut into profits.
   Federated said it lost $1.34 billion during the fourth quarter
on sales of $1.59 billion, compared with a profit of $27.6 million
and sales of $1.49 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   The results were sharply affected by a $1.15 billion writedown
of goodwill _ the amount over Federated's book value that Campeau
paid to acquire the company in 1988 _ an accounting move made to
reflect the deterioration of Federated's financial situation during
the year.
   Federated's earnings also were reduced by $126.5 million in
deferred financing and reorganization costs and by $516.1 million
in net interest expense.
   The company had operating income of $48.6 million, down from
$175.9 million a year earlier.
   Allied said it lost $836.8 million on sales of $892.2 million,
compared with a profit of 37.6 million on sales of $869.8 million a
year earlier.
   Allied's earnings were reduced by non-operating charges of
$660.3 million for its equity in Federated, $290.6 million in net
interest expense and $138.8 million in income tax expense.
   The company's operating income was $25.2 million in the quarter,
down from $86.2 million a year earlier.
   For the full year, Federated posted a net loss of 1.5 billion,
compared with a loss of $156.3 billion a year earlier. Sales rose
7.2 percent to $4.87 billion from $3.57 billion.
   Allied's net loss on the year was $925.2 million, compared with
a profit of $51.4 million the previous year. Sales rose 5.2 percent
to $2.7 billion from $2.57 billion.
   At the end of the fiscal year, Federated had $367 million in
cash on hand and Allied had $185 million in cash, the companies
reported.
   Both also showed positive cash flows, $372.4 million for
Federated and $199.7 million for Allied for the full year, although
the companies are not making interest payments while in bankruptcy
court reorganization.
   Federated owns the Bloomingdale's, Lazarus, Abraham and Straus,
Rich's and Burdine's chains. Allied's chains include Jordan Marsh,
Stern's, Maas Brothers and The Bon Marche.
   Campeau, which spun off its department store businesses shortly
before they entered bankruptcy court protection, is attempting to
work out of its own financial problems.
   In a business plan proposed to holders of $184 million of its
debentures, Campeau said it would ask bondholders to waive any
defaults and defer interest payments through Dec. 31, 1991.
   In return, the company would sell assets from its real estate
holdings to make a ``major reduction'' in its secured debt. Campeau
also would pay secured loans with cash flow from the properties
used as collateral.
   Bondholders would consider the plan at a previously scheduled
June 1 meeting in Toronto.
   Campeau's real estate holdings consist primarily of shopping
malls and office complexes and business in the United States and
Canada.

   The Federal Communications Commission ruled
Friday that the Fox Broadcasting Co. will be able to grow as a
network while its parent company continues selling television shows
into syndication.
   The decision, which grants Fox a one-year waiver to FCC
guidelines, allows the network to show up to 18{ hours of
programming a week. But Fox will be prohibited from acquiring any
financial interest in or syndication rights to new programs while
the the waiver is in effect.
   Before the ruling, networks showing more than 15 hours of
programming a week were forbidden by the FCC from participating in
the television syndication business.
   Fox asked for the waiver in January, saying the television
market had changed substantially since the rules were adopted in
1970 when the three major networks dominated the television market.
   Shows syndicated by Fox Inc., the parent company of the network,
include ``A Current Affair,'' ``Mr. Belvedere'' and ``MASH.''
   The ruling comes as the three networks are fighting to repeal
the 1970 financial interest and syndication rules. The rules forbid
the networks from owning programs sold into the lucrative
television syndication market.
   The networks contend the prohibition unfairly limits their
access to viewers.
   The 3-year-old Fox network was awarded the limited waiver, the
FCC said, because the commission wants to encourage new national
networks, help supply programming for the 112 Fox-affiliated
stations on the UHF band, and advance children's programming.
   The Fox network plans to introduce a 2{-hour daily block of
children's shows this fall. Fox also plans later this year to add
programming on Wednesday and Friday night and on Saturday morning.
   ``The interim waiver announced today will permit the continued
growth and development of Fox Broadcasting Co. as we all strive to
achieve a global resolution of the financial interest and
syndication issues,'' Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc., said in a
statement.
   The ruling was opposed by the Motion Picture Association of
America and the Walt Disney Co., among others. Those opposing the
decision fear the three established networks and Fox will force
other production companies out of business if they enter into
syndication.
   Joe Rutledge, vice president of corporate communication for NBC,
said the network feared the ruling ``removes the immediate pressure
on Fox and the studios to reach a settlement'' on the issue of the
financial interest and syndication rules.
   He did say, however, that NBC applauded the FCC's inclination to
remove anti-competetive barriers from television networks.
   Preston Padden, senior vice president for affiliates for Fox
Broadcasting, said the network will continue to battle against the
financial interest and syndication rules.
   ``We are prepared to see the fight through and get appropriate
regualatory relief for the three networks as well.''
