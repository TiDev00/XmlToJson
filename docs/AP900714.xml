   Employees of a grocery store are losing
patience with the continuing escapades of a squirrel that has taken
up residence amid the coffee cakes, doughnuts and hot dog rolls.
   The critter has run up a $25 tab at the Farm Fare IGA over the
last two weeks.
   Employees took to shooing the squirrel outside, but it keeps
coming back.
   ``It was a joke the first couple of times, but now he is
beginning to be a problem,'' said store manager Dick Emery.
   The squirrel once jumped over a woman's shoulder as she reached
for a box of rice, leaving her shrieking as it high-tailed it up
the aisle.
   ``I came in one morning and there he was, just sitting down on
top of the wine coolers in the front of the store,'' Emery said.
``It was almost as if he was waiting for the chase to begin.''
   Fritz Sabbow, executive director of the local Humane Society,
said the only way to catch the squirrel will be with a net ``and it
won't be easy. They are pretty quick.''

   More than 45,000 bottles of a prescription eye
solution are being recalled because that may be contaminated with
bacteria that could cause a sight-threatening infection in a
scratched eye, officials said Friday.
   The product made by Fisons Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., is
Opticrom, generically known as cromolyn sodium, in a 4 percent
ophthalmic solution. It is sold in 10 milliliter bottles, the Food
and Drug Administration said.
   The two lots being recalled are KF7A and KF35V. The lot
identification appears on the bottom of the bottle and also on the
flap of the cardboard container the bottle comes in.
   The FDA advises consumers to return bottles in these lots to
their pharmacies. The solution is prescribed to treat several rare
eye conditions.
   Testing by Fisons PLC Pharmaceutical Division in the United
Kingdom found Bacillus cereus in lot KF7A, and an unidentified
bacillus in the other lot, the FDA said.
   Both lots were distributed nationwide and in Puerto Rico. The
FDA said that about 114 bottles of KF7A and 45,223 bottles of KF35V
were distributed.

   If math teachers are asked 98 questions
on a certification test, how many do they have to get right to
pass? A.) 90; B.) 70; C.) 60, or D.) 49.
   In a new certification test in Florida, the correct answer is C.
And although a score of 60 would earn most students a D on a math
exam, the Florida standard is high compared to some other states.
   Fifteen states use a different exam, developed by a national
testing company, and have established cutoff scores that range from
approximately 35 percent of 150 questions to a high of
approximately 55 percent.
   ``It won't do any good to have passing scores ... that nobody
can reach,'' said Tom Fisher, head of testing for the Florida
Department of Education.
   The supply and demand of teachers is a problem that always
confronts states as they debate certification requirements, said
Catherine Havrilesky, executive director of teacher programs at
Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, N.J.
   And math teachers are in short supply everywhere, according to
Iris Carl, president of the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics and director of mathematics for the Houston Independent
School District.
   Marita Eng, a high school math teacher in Jacksonville who sat
on an advisory panel that recommended a higher cutoff score in
Florida, said international comparisons of student performance show
that the United States is in the middle of a ``crisis in
mathematics education.''
   One of the problems, Eng said, is poorly prepared teachers.
   Carl conceded the scores required of math teachers across the
nation seem low and concern her.
   However, defenders of the testing system point out that the
exams include hard questions and aren't designed to result in
extremely high scores.
   The ETS developed the 150-question test used by 15 states. It
also offers tests in about 40 other subjects.
   Some of the other cutoff scores include from 50 percent to 55
percent for early childhood education, from 40 percent to 45
percent in earth-space science, from 40 percent to 55 percent for
chemistry, and from 40 percent to 60 percent in physics.
   In math, the low qualifying score was set by Kentucky at 35
percent and the high by California at 55 percent.
   Rod Roth, who worked on adoption of the ETS test in Arkansas,
said he didn't think the overall national standards were low. The
test is designed to spread out the results by including some very
difficult questions, according to Roth, now dean of the College of
Education at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa.
   The ETS' Havrikesky said the important issue about the math test
was whether it was fair.
   Besides the 15 states that use the ETS test, four are
considering adopting it. Five other states have customized tests
developed with the help of National Evaluation Systems in Amherst,
Mass. NES does not have figures for those states.
   Probably about a third of the states don't require specific math
certification tests for teachers, according to Roth.
   Emily Feistritzer, director of the National Center for Education
Information, a private research organization in Washington, called
it shocking that each state sets its own teacher certification
standards.
   ``The data is so scattered _ there really is no national data as
far as teachers are concerned,'' she said.
   But Carl noted that the same 1987 study that put the best U.S.
students near the bottom in international math ability found that
most high school math teachers in the United States were better
trained than their Japanese counterparts.
   Fisher, of the Florida Education Department, recommended to Gov.
Bob Martinez and the cabinet last month that the state require a
cutoff score of 49.
   Fisher based his arguments on the performance record established
by the first several hundred people to take Florida's test. If
prospective math teachers were required to correctly answer half
the test, two-thirds would probably pass, he said.
   Martinez and the cabinet members said 49 was too low. But they
also rejected an advisory panel's suggestions that the state
establish a score of 70.
   If the state had adopted that standard, only 14 percent of the
first 332 people to take the math test would have passed. With a
passing score of 60, the success rate is expected to be 37 percent.

   Here are the cutoff scores established
by the 15 states that use the math teacher test developed by the
Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.
   ETS grading consists of converting a raw score of the total
number of correct answers to 150 multiple-choice questions to a
score on a scale ranging from 250 to 990. This is done
statistically to account for any variations in the difficulty of
various versions of the test.
   Roughly speaking, the score of 500 equates to 35 percent and the
score of 630 equates to 55 percent, according to Kim Kimble, an
administrator of teacher programs and services with ETS. The median
score of 540 equates to 40 percent.
   Arkansas 530
   California 630
   Connecticut 580
   Hawaii 530
   Indiana 530
   Kentucky 500
   Louisiana 550
   Maryland 520
   Mississippi 520
   New Jersey 550
   North Carolina 510
   Pennsylanvia 540
   South Carolina 560
   Tennesseee 520
   Virginia 580
   
   Missouri, Nevada, New York, Ohio in February were in the process
of adopting the test and have yet to establish cutoff scores.
   West Virginia, Georgia, Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas have
individualized tests developed with the help of National National
Evaluation Systems in Amherst, Mass.

<HEAD>Flood of Outsiders Has Changed Hemingway's Fiesta</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is 7:30 a.m., time for the new daily
ritual that precedes the one Ernest Hemingway made famous.
   An hour before the running of the bulls, a line of 30 policemen
sweeps down the blocked-off cobblestone streets that lead from
Pamplona's corrals to the bullring, clearing out drunken revelers.
   Street cleaning machines follow, armed with high-powered hoses
that blast away another night's accumulation of plastic cups,
champagne bottles and other trash _ 700 tons each day, according to
one local newspaper.
   This year's raucous, weeklong San Fermin festival was to end
today. The annual fiesta, immortalized in Hemingway's 1926 novel,
``The Sun Also Rises,'' has been held continuously since 1591, but
the flood of foreigners who now attend has changed the nature of
San Fermin.
   ``The main problem is that it's overcrowded,'' said Jose Miguel
Olaiz, who helps coordinate the Navarre regional government's
special 12-ambulance emergency service during the festival.
   ``When I was a kid, we were mostly locals with a few outsiders.
Now it's the opposite,'' the 37-year-old Pamplona native said. Many
locals leave the city during the fiesta to avoid the noise and
crush.
   Handling the media takes up so much time now that the regional
emergency service last year began sending out daily faxes with
information on gorings and other injuries. The computerized
information is broken down according to age, sex, time of day and
type of injury.
   Records kept since the festival began indicate 52 people have
met their deaths on the horns of running bulls, 13 since 1924 when
Hemingway reportedly first saw the event.
   The morning running of the bulls, which usually lasts no more
than five minutes, is covered live on national television and radio.
   More than 100 people, mainly young men, test their mettle by
running ahead of and alongside the bulls and six steers along the
half-mile route to the bullring, where the bulls are killed in the
day's bullfight.
   City fathers now issue special passes to limit the number of
photographers and cameramen allowed on the specially built
barricades that separate the bulls and runners from the public.
   They have also tried to reduce the number of people who run with
the bulls during the annual festival, which honors the patron saint
of Pamplona, a city of 200,000.
   Up to 100 people _ some of them first-timers pumped up by
alcohol _ now join the core group of 20-30 natives or ``mozos,''
who carry rolled up newspapers to fend off the bulls.
   The novices sometimes get in the way of the natives and
occasionally mistreat the bulls and steers. This week, one youth
dressed in the traditional white shirt and pants and red bandanna
punched another runner who hit a bull.
   Women traditionally do not run with the bulls and few are ever
seen among the runners.
   The number of tourists has also increased the incidence of
injuries related to drunkenness, Olaiz said.
   ``It's not that the local people drink less, but at least they
go home at the end of the night,'' he said. ``Some of the
foreigners seem to come expressly to drink _ they don't understand
the spirit of the fiesta.''
   Since the hotels are filled to overflowing, many foreigners
sleep less than the youth of Pamplona, who generally don't go to
bed until the 8 a.m. running of the bulls is over.
   Families that begin their day with the daily bull run now are
oblivious to sleeping revelers stretched out on city benches, on
top of cars, in doorways and on park grass.
   But the worst time of the day, according to the Navarre
emergency services faxes, comes at around 3 p.m.
   ``That's when the energy level of the fiesta goes down and
people who have been drinking sit down and realize just how bad off
they are,'' Olaiz said.

   It was the moment Arjan Xhaferi had been
waiting for.
   Hundreds of Albanians were surging into foreign embassies in the
capital, he learned one night two weeks ago. In no time, the
32-year-old factory worker was on the phone to his friends in
Shkodar, a city in northern Albania.
   ``I said, `Hurry, we can win our liberty,''' he recalled. A few
nights later, Xhaferi, his pregnant wife, his daughter and their
friends clambered over the wall of the West German Embassy in
Tirana.
   On Friday, they were among more than 4,000 people who were
ferried out of Albania to Italy in a sealift set up through U.N.
mediation.
   ``I have sacrificed everything _ even my life,'' said Xhaferi,
speaking in Italian. ``We have searched for liberty for so much
time.''
   He gazed at his wife, who was smiling despite the heat and
fatigue, a hand resting on her swollen belly.
   ``We hope the baby is free,'' he said, grinning shyly.
   The Xhaferis had some particular reasons for being unhappy in
Albania.
   A friend had tried unsuccessfully to flee the country, and his
family was under pressure from the government, Xhaferi said.
   But they had more general reasons too: the poor quality of life
and the ban on the practice of religion, which hurt the Roman
Catholic family.
   Albania was 70 percent Moslem before the government closed all
mosques and churches in 1967.
   ``We want freedom, we want a new economy, a new government and a
new society _ of democracy,'' Xhaferi declared.
   While the West German Embassy provided the door to a new life,
the Xhaferis did not have an easy time there.
   Every day, the Albanian government shut off the water for
several hours in the building, packed with 3,200 refugees. Toilets
stopped working and overflowed. Men slept in a few rooms, crowded
on the floor; women and children in other rooms.
   Nonetheless, he says, West German diplomats were ``wonderful,''
giving them meat and bread, as well as milk for 5-year-old Arrisa.
   The Xhaferis finally got to leave the embassy late Thursday,
after ferries sent by Western European governments for the refugees
docked in the port of Durres.
   But the ordeal was not over yet. The heat in the
government-owned busses was oppressively high, and it was
impossible to open the windows, Xhaferi said.
   Their ferry left at 3 a.m. Friday and pulled into port seven
hours later. Still ahead for the family was a 30-hour train trip to
West Germany.
   But there were no complaints.
   ``We are leaving communism forever,'' Xhaferi grinned.

   While the government is redesigning currency
to thwart counterfeiters, it ought to make the bills more
attractive, says a man who used to run the Treasury's
money-producing agency.
   ``The principles and history of a country are recounted in the
art of bank notes,'' Robert J. Leuver told the Senate Banking
Committee on Friday. ``We seem to have lost the art, majesty and
history provided in our national bank notes of 1896, silver
certificates of 1896 and the beautiful $2 bill of 1976.''
   ``The `Tin Lizzy' (vintage car) on the back of the $10 bill
harkens to a different time and does not afford the counterfeit
detection we need,'' said Leuver, a former chief of the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing who now directs the American Numismatic
Association.
   Leuver said most of the anti-counterfeiting deterrents built
into currency are less effective than they could be because of the
50-year-old design of the bills.
   As an example, he mentioned the mylar ``security thread'' that
soon will become a part of every greenback. The thread will include
printing that can be read only in indirect light.
   ``This deterrent will particularly thwart counterfeiters who ply
their trade outside of the United States,'' he said. ``However, the
current design of the note ... obscures the thread or causes it to
be overlooked.''
   Leuver, along with officials from the Secret Service and the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing, endorsed a bill to toughen laws
against counterfeiting.
   Carl V. D'Alessandro, assistant director of the bureau, told the
committee that currency and other securities can be counterfeited
with remarkable accuracy using widely available computers, printers
and copiers.
   ``The potential counterfeiter no longer requires any particular
expertise in printing, but only the inclination and the electronic
devices,'' he said.
   ``Just as the counterfeiting of currency by multicolored copiers
has increased greatly over the past few years, so will the use of
computer laser scanners as a means to scan, store and subsequently
counterfeit currency,'' said William J. Ebert, who heads the Secret
Service's counterfeit division.
   Ebert said $13.8 million of counterfeit currency was passed in
this country last year and $75.2 million was seized before it was
put into circulation. Some $103 million in bogus U.S. bills was
confiscated abroad.
   The measure D'Allesandro and Ebert endorsed would make it a
crime to possess any laser-type device the Treasury Department
concludes would help a counterfeiter, and would ensure that
duplication of currency by any electronic method is illegal.
   It would bar private possession of any counterfeit-deterrent
device, including watermarks and seals, just as the distinctive
paper on which greenbacks are printed now is protected.
   But Kenneth A. Wasch, executive director of the Software
Publishers Association, whose members develop computer programs,
said the bill is so broad that ``many heretofore legal activities
may now be made illegal.''
   He said the prohibition on private possession of certain optical
devices could ``mean document scanners, desktop computers, a number
of software programs, laser printers and other high-tech wonders
could be outlawed even though they are in use everywhere.''

   President Bush is eager to sign civil rights
legislation aimed at drawing millions of disabled Americans into
the work force and marketplace.
   ``This legislation will serve as a declaration of independence
for millions of persons with disabilities in this country,'' Bush
said Friday after a 91-6 Senate vote sent the Americans With
Disabilities Act to the White House.
   ``It will change the way we live forever,'' said the chief
Senate sponsor, Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa.
   In a dramatic conclusion of nine months of debate on the bill,
Harkin addressed the Senate in sign language as a tribute to his
brother Frank, who is deaf.
   ``I wanted to say to my brother Frank that today was my proudest
day in 16 years in Congress,'' Harkin explained.
   The bill aims at doing for people with mental and physical
impairments what the 1964 Civil Rights Act strived to do for blacks
and other minorities. It bans discrimination against the disabled
in employment, public accommodations, transportation and
telecommunications.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would sign the
bill into law as soon as a ceremony could be arranged, probably as
early as next week. Fitzwater called the measure one of the `most
important accomplishments of this administration.''
   Civil rights lobbyists complain that the White House did little
to help the bill after the Senate initially passed it last
September by a 76-8 vote. Friday's vote was on a compromise version.
   ``There's no question that President Bush and Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh played a constructive role in fashioning a
bipartisan consensus in the Senate in 1989,'' said Ralph G. Neas,
executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an
umbrella group for civil rights and labor organizations. ``We have
applauded that effort.''
   But Neas added: ``There's no question that since September 1989
the administration has done very little.''
   In the meantime, the bill went through a series of House
hearings, leading to House approval of its own version, 403-20, in
May. The House passed the compromise, 377-28, Thursday night.
   Between the original votes in the House and Senate, lawmakers
were lobbied strongly by the Chamber of Commerce and the National
Federation of Independent Business, which complained the bill is
excessively burdensome.
   Although a few minor concessions emerged, the Senate bill
remained basically intact. The Senate bill had been refined after
extensive negotiations with the White House.
   The bill was conceived in 1988 by the National Council on
Disability, a 15-member commission appointed by President Reagan.
The original legislation, introduced by Sen. Lowell Weicker,
R-Conn., and cosponsored by Harkin, was scuttled because of various
problems. Harkin sponsored the new bill last year.
   The final hurdle was an amendment from the House that would have
let employers reassign AIDS-infected workers from food-handling
duties.
   Under an agreement reached early Thursday by House and Senate
negotiators, AIDS-infected workers could be reassigned only if the
Department of Health and Human Services found that the disease
could be passed along through contact with food.
   HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan and other officials say no
evidence exists that AIDS is spread through food or casual contact.
   In an effort to ease its impact on business, lawmakers included
language phasing in the bill's requirements. The bill also exempts
from the hiring provisions businesses with fewer than 15 employees.
   Voting against the bill Friday were Sens. Christopher S. Bond,
R-Mo.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.,
   Not voting were Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; James A.
McClure, R-Idaho; and Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo.

<HEAD>Government Ignored Secret Pleas for Cancer Studies at Arms Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The agency that ran nuclear weapons production
in the 1940s rejected secret advice to study cancer risks for its
workers, even though it knew some were exposed to large doses of
radiation, documents show.
   Records of the Atomic Energy Commission also show that airborne
emissions of radiation continued at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation
in Washington state from the plant's start-up in 1944 until at
least the mid-1950s.
   The AEC was a predecessor to the Energy Department, which owns
all the government's nuclear arms factories.
   The government first acknowledged the Hanford problems publicly
in 1986, although much information about radiation releases there
is still classified as secret.
   On Thursday, a panel of health experts disclosed that one in 20
residents living near Hanford, on the Columbia River near Richland,
Wash., between late 1944 and December 1947 absorbed a level of
radiation equal to 1,200 times what the Energy Department now
considers a safe limit.
   The panel of independent health specialists said the releases of
radioactive iodine _ a byproduct of extracting plutonium from
uranium _ were serious enough to justify a study of potential
illnesses or deaths related to the emissions.
   The release of the report marked the first time the government
has publicly acknowledged that radiation releases from its nuclear
arms factories could have harmed human health.
   Yet the government was made aware shortly after the Hanford
plant began operating in September 1944 that airborne contaminants
posed serious health risks.
   In a March 1948 report, the radiation health and safety chief at
Hanford wrote that emissions of radioactive particles from the
plant's plutonium-processing buildings ``can produce radiation
damage.'' He also said that ``the theoretical possibility of injury
developing 10 to 15 years from now poses a serious problem.''
   The Atomic Energy Commission rejected a recommendation by its
biology and medicine advisory panel in early 1949 that studies be
conducted on possible links between cancer and Hanford workers'
exposure to radiation, AEC records show.
   The AEC records were cited in a December 1989 report by the
Democratic majority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee that recommended the Energy Department make public more
of its long-secret data on radiation releases at Hanford.
   The latest government admission of potential health hazards to
people near Hanford is part of an evolution of openness about
nuclear weapons operations.
   In a 1945 government report that revealed the existence of the
once-secret Hanford and other plants, an Army official involved in
the project wrote: ``Factors of safety used in plant design and
operation are so great that the hazards of the home and the family
car are far greater for the personnel than any arising from the
plants.''
   Gene Plock, who worked as an engineer at Hanford's
plutonium-processing buildings from 1946 to 1950, said in an
interview Friday that he and others in his work crew were informed
of the emissions problem in late 1946 _ months after it was
discovered by General Electric Co., which ran Hanford under a
government contract.
   Plock said he and some other workers then began wearing
protective masks.
   He said he recommended that military guards outside the building
also be informed, and that they be required to wear protective
masks. He said GE rejected his suggestion.
   ``Their response was, `No, let's not alarm them,''' he said.
   The Hanford study released Thursday contains the most specific
information known to the public about radiation releases at that
facility. Yet it tells only part of the story of accidental and
intentional emissions of radiation from Hanford.
   In addition to the radioactive iodine, significant amounts of
plutonium particles, ruthenium, americium and other potentially
cancer-causing products were released from processing stacks on the
560-square-mile plant in 1940s and '50s, according to AEC records.

<TEXT>
   The creator of a huge outdoor mural
depicting Adam and Eve on a beach refuses to bow to city pressure
to add children and paint bathing suits on the nude pair.
   Mayor Sal Oliveri said the wall of a motel isn't the place for
the mural, but artist Steven Kroeger vowed not to change a thing
and pledged to go to court if the city takes action against his
work.
   The mayor contends the 8-foot-tall by 24-foot-long mural at
Sunray Lodge isn't in keeping with the city's family-oriented
image. City officials want bathing suits _ and children _ added to
the recently-drawn painting.
   ``It's just out of place. We don't want to start a style or
trend of nude pictures on buildings,'' said Oliveri, who inspected
the painting Thursday.
   Kroeger hired Miami attorney Ellis Rubin, who puts the wrangle
in the same category as recent Broward County controversies over
the propriety of a 2 Live Crew rap album and T-thong bathing suits.
   ``Broward County is now four-for-four,'' Rubin said. ``You can't
buy certain records, you can't listen to certain music, you can't
wear certain bathing suits and now you can't paint certain murals.''
   Kroeger said he can't understand the fuss. ``Would they have put
bathing suits on a Rubens?''
   Motel owner Doris Ouellet called the controversy silly.
   ``This represents Adam and Eve in paradise,'' she said. ``In
paradise, Adam and Eve didn't have children. They didn't wear
bikinis, either.''

   Rocker David Lee Roth has
caught the wary eye of city officials with a 20-foot-high portrait
of a scantily-clad woman on the outside wall of a recording studio.
   The portrait, with Roth's name emblazoned across the woman's
chest, is on the rear wall of Little Mountain Sound studio, where
fans waiting for a peek of favorite rockers who record there have
sprayed a montage of graffiti.
   Roth, former lead singer of Van Halen, commissioned the
airbrushed artwork that went up last month as a ``poetic and
symbolic tribute to the city of Vancouver,'' said his road manager,
Eddie Anderson.
   ``What better (tribute) than a beautiful woman sitting amidst
the city?'' Anderson said.
   City officials don't see it that way. They're getting complaints
and have told the studio's owners they must apply for a wall mural
permit. Even with a permit, the city may decide to order the
portrait's removal, said Jack Perry, deputy chief licence inspector
for the city.
   Among other rockers who use the studio are Bon Jovi, Aerosmith,
Motley Crue and Whitesnake.

   Phillips, 54, said he managed to wean himself off drugs in a

   Recovery isn't easy, especially in the music business because
drugs are easily obtained backstage, Phillips said.
   ``I'm much better around it (drugs) now. It takes a long time to
get over cocaine.''
   In his book, ``Papa John,'' Phillips describes a heroin
addiction that nearly killed him, followed by a cocaine ``cure''
that left him addicted to that drug.

<HEAD>Party Urged to Rally Behind Bush _ Even on Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Conservatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican Party is urging its local leaders
to rally behind President Bush as he considers tax increases that
many in the GOP wish he would go back to opposing.
   The president's abrupt switch on taxes late last month caught
most Republicans off guard, and left many questioning why Bush
would abandon his campaign pledge with crucial 1990 elections just
four months away.
   After initially lying low in the tax debate, party leaders came
out swinging Friday, painting Bush's turnabout as a tough but bold
move to help erase the federal deficit.
   Republican Illinois Gov. James Thompson said Bush ``had the
courage to summon up the political will to do what was right for
the country.''
   But angry conservative leaders called a news conference in
Washington to denounce Bush's retreat on taxes and other stands and
threaten a possible re-election challenge.
   If the president ``stays in his present course, he will be
challenged in 1992, almost certainly in the Republican primaries
and certainly in the general election,'' said Howard Phillips,
chairman of the Conservative Caucus.
   Bush has ``dealt a crippling blow to his own credibility,''
added David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
   Despite their understandable trepidation over the possible
political fallout, Thompson said it was no time for Republicans to
back away from Bush.
   ``It is the obligation of Republicans, I think, to stand up for
the president when the president is willing to take the political
heat to stand up for the nation,'' the governor said.
   The GOP leaders, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, insisted the
next move is up to Democrats. They said the Democrats must offer
significant domestic spending cuts and budget-process reforms or
watch Bush call off the bipartisan budget talks.
   ``We have put revenues on the table,'' Quayle said in a speech
to the Republican National Committee's midyear meeting. ``Today, I
call on the congressional Democrats to come forth with their
proposed spending cuts. Their silence on this issue _ as usual _ is
deafening.''
   Quayle told the RNC members that Bush would not cut a deal
favorable to Democrats.
   ``His position is simple,'' Quayle said: ``a good deal or no
deal at all.''
   If the Democrats don't make significant proposals soon, many
Republicans believe Bush should walk out on the talks.
   Such a move won a ringing endorsement from Peggy Noonan, a
former speechwriter for Reagan and Bush who wrote Bush's ``read my
lips: no new taxes'' pledge.
   Noonan, who is no longer involved in party affairs, won applause
from the RNC when she suggested Bush should ``push himself away
from the table and cut himself a walking stick'' unless Democrats
offer sizable spending cuts.
   ``I truly believe we must not lose the tax issue,'' she said.
``There is no more potent issue than this.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany's governing coalition has
agreed to cut the country's obligatory military service from 15
months to 12 months.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told reporters on Friday
that a measure would be submitted to lawmakers in September. It
would affect all recruits drafted after October 1989, he said.
   The decision was expected to reduce the size of the West German
military by 35,000. During last week's NATO summit, the West
Germans promised to announce by the fall their plans for troop
cutbacks in a united German military.
   The potential size of a united German army has been one of
Moscow's concerns as German unification approaches. West Germany
has about 465,000 active-duty troops and East Germany about 100,000.

   The tissue analyses are scheduled to begin early next year.
   ``It is possible that the AIDS virus could have existed for
thousands of years in another non-dangerous form,'' said Gelen.

   In the accident, the British Midland Boeing 737's left engine

   The prosecution in Marion Barry's trial is
nearing the end of its case and the mayor's lawyers say they plan
an extensive defense that could last nearly two weeks.
   Ten to 15 witnesses will appear on Barry's behalf at his cocaine
and perjury trial, defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said Friday.
He said the testimony is ``going to be full of thrills and
surprises.''
   It's not been decided whether Barry will take the witness stand
in his own defense, but the mayor ``is champing at the bit'' to
testify, Mundy told reporters.
   The government began presenting its case June 19 and is expected
to finish Tuesday when the trial resumes. Its remaining witnesses
are two friends of the mayor, Bettye Smith and Doris Crenshaw.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he anticipates
the defense case could take the trial into the last full week of
July.
   On Friday, a longtime friend of the mayor, Darrell Sabbs, said
his recollections of the timing of cocaine use with the mayor were
heavily influenced by the FBI and prosecutors.
   Sabbs, who was reluctantly testifying for the prosecution, said
he used cocaine with Barry five times between 1986 and 1989. But he
said he has great difficulty remembering the years of the alleged
use.
   Sabbs said he was ``under intense pressure by the government to
testify.''
   Mundy suggested to Sabbs that he had been told by the FBI
regarding certain details of his alleged cocaine use with the
mayor, ``It had to be this way.''
   ``Yes,'' Sabbs replied.
   ``That happened repeatedly,'' said Mundy.
   ``It happened quite a few times,'' Sabbs agreed.
   ``You have difficulty with events'' and it's ``difficult to say
with specificity'' when, where and what occurred, Mundy said at one
point.
   ``It's been hard, yes sir,'' Sabbs responded.
   He said, ``The criminality and the politics have been so intense
in this case'' that ``my responses only reflected the ... stress I
was under.''
   Sabbs told the FBI in March that he snorted cocaine with the
mayor at a restaurant in 1989. In May, he told the FBI it had taken
place a year earlier. He then changed it back to 1989 when he
testified before a federal grand jury.
   He settled on 1987 when he testified Thursday at Barry's trial,
after prosecutors showed Sabbs an invitation to his own birthday
party at the restaurant. He said, however, that he had birthday
parties at the restaurant twice and now thinks Barry's appearance
was at the one in 1987.
   ``I am very confused ... it leaves me very baffled,'' said Sabbs.
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of possessing cocaine, one count
of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury
about drug use.
   Cesar Gaviria, the president-elect of Colombia, said in an
interview in today's editions of The Washington Post that if Barry
were not convicted, ``a lot of damage'' would be done to his
embattled country's war on druglords.
   ``We are on the front lines. We are losing so many lives,
confronting terrorism and bombings, fighting the
narco-traffickers,'' Gaviria told the newspaper.
   ``To see a person who has been mayor, who has been a very
important person in this country and consumes drugs and (he)
doesn't have any sanctions, we would have a lot of damage in
Colombian opinion ....''
   Barry's press secretary, Lurma Rackley, said the mayor would
have no comment on Gaviria's remarks.

<HEAD>Politicians Give Census Low Marks for Accuracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau's claim that it has counted
99.5 percent of all U.S. households on its master list does not
mean the census will be accurate, two lawmakers say.
   The claim ``is as nonsensical as a little kid saying his room is
all clean after he has shoved all of his clothes and toys in the
closet and closes the door,'' Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said
Friday.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., agreed.
   ``When it is declared that a city, a county, has been 100
percent enumerated, that simply means that all the known residences
have been heard from,'' Moynihan said. ``... There will always be
some missing in the count.''
   The criticism came at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
hearing on the status of the headcount and the nomination of
Barbara Everitt Bryant to be director of the Bureau of the Census.
   Schumer contended that the 1990 census has been riddled with
inaccuracies and omissions that will render it the worst national
head count in U.S. history.
   ``The magnitude of the (Census) Bureau's mission does not excuse
it from the sorts of logistical and bureaucratic gaffes we have
witnessed over the past few months,'' Schumer testified.
   But Bryant, who has been acting Census Bureau director for seven
months, stressed that the tally isn't finished and ``the fat lady
has not sung.''
   ``This has been a well-planned census, despite what some
detractors said,'' she said.
   Schumer ticked off a list of problems, including the fact that
at least 18 percent of New York City's households did not receive
forms because the bureau's mailing lists were so bad.
   However, Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, who chairs the House Post
Office subcommittee on census and population, declined to call the
census a failure.
   ``I don't believe either that the Census Bureau has failed to
execute the best census it could,'' he said. ``But what I am
prepared to say at this juncture is that the design of the census
appears inadequate to measure a society as diverse and complex as
ours.''
   Officials from the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, agreed that the 1990 census presented unusual
challenges.
   L. Nye Stevens, director of the GAO's business operations issues
department, pointed to a lower-than-expected response rate to
mailed questionnaires, staffing problems and money shortages.
   ``GAO believes that the 1990 census experience demonstrates the
need for fundamental rethinking of how the 2000 and future censuses
should be taken,'' he testified.
   New York City and several other large urban centers have gone to
court to force the Commerce Department to statistically adjust the
census for an expected undercount. Such methodology now exists,
Moynihan said, but the Commerce Department overruled the Census
Bureau's plans to use it.
   ``It is on the edge of scandal,'' he added. ``They said do not
do what was clearly a constitutional responsibility.''
   New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said the Commerce Department's
reluctance to adjust for an undercount is politically motivated.
   ``I can find no other rationale to which to assign this decision
except political consideration,'' he said.
   Dinkins asked the committee to make sure that Bryant and the
Census Bureau live up to the court-mandated agreement to make an
adjustment decision no later than July 15, 1991.

   The government has announced emergency
water-saving measures and says it will use supertankers to

   Steps announced Friday also include drilling for fresh supplies,
swiftly repairing a damaged pipe network, and diverting a river in
central Greece to a reservoir that supplies Athens.
   Water rates were raised drastically earlier this year, resulting
in a 15 percent drop in consumption, authorities said.
   In the future, consumers who reduce their rate of water
consumption are to be charged lower rates, and those who use more
will pay higher rates.
   The capital's water utility company says its reserves are
expected to last until early November, when the rainy season

   The Energy Department says it recruited the
Army Corps of Engineers to help clean up environmental damage at
federal nuclear weapons plants.
   ``The Corps of Engineers has many significant skills that can
help us in our waste cleanup program,'' Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins said in announcing Friday that his department had signed an
agreement with the corps.
   Among the work to be provided by the corps is management
services to Energy Department headquarters, technical assistance in
planning and building waste cleanup projects at specific weapons
sites and preparing cost estimates.
   Cathy Kaliniak, a department spokeswoman, said the corps would
be involved in helping clean up the Hanford nuclear weapons plant
in south-central Washington state, which is the most contaminated
of the 17 major weapons plants. She said it had not been determined
where else it might be involved.
   Watkins said the deal, signed late Thursday, is ``a very
important step'' toward restoring the environment at the weapons
plants, which operated for decades with no outside oversight.
   The full cleanup effort is expected to take more than 30 years
and cost more than $100 billion.

   Humidity helped firefighters conquer a 6,500-acre brushfire

ignited the blaze six miles southeast of Sisters, Ore. The fire had

another department spokesman.
   At least six nearby homes were not in immediate danger.
   More firefighters will be added to the crew of 100 that had been
battling the blaze, Decker said.
   Lightning storms this week started a total of 300 fires around
Oregon, Fisher said.
   California's fire started Thursday in Chino Hills State Park, 40
miles southeast of Los Angeles, but it was fully surrounded Friday
afternoon, said fire spokeswoman Maria Sobol.
   ``At this point it's not going anywhere. If weather conditions
stay the same, it looks pretty good,'' she said. A lack of wind as
well as moisture in the air aided the 700 firefighters.
   A 15-year-old Yorba Linda boy was arrested for investigation of
unlawful use of a model rocket. It is illegal for a minor to use
such rockets without supervision.
   The teen, released to his family, told officials the rocket
malfunctioned and crashed into the dry brush. He tried to stamp the
fire out, suffering minor burns to his leg, then called 911.
   In Wyoming, more than 80 firefighters, aided by fire retardant
drops by air tankers, battled flames Friday from Yellowstone
National Park's 12th fire of the year.
   It was only the second fire, however, to grow larger than two
acres. The first, a 220-acre fire, was contained Monday.
   In Washington state, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Ron Dehart
said most of the 55 small lightning fires in the Mount
Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest have either been put out or were
under attack.
   Totaling less than 60 acres, they were scattered in dozens of
remote areas in eastern Snohomish, Skagit and King counties, he
said.
   More than 30 lightning-sparked fires, ranging from small spots
to 100 acres, were burning Friday in the rugged 3,000-foot to
7,000-foot slopes of the eastern Cascades, in the Wenatchee
National Forest.

<HEAD>Reserve Officers' Training Corps Units in 27 States To Close</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army is closing 50 college ROTC units in
27 states as part of a broad plan to shrink the service.
   The shutdowns, effective at the end of the 1990-91 academic
year, will affect students at colleges and universities primarily
in the Northeast and Midwest that have small numbers of cadets.
   G. Kim Wincup, assistant Army secretary for manpower and reserve
affairs, said Friday that closing the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps units was deemed necessary to cut the Army's overall size by
20 percent over the next five years.
   ``It's a pretty painful process for the Army,'' he said. ``We
just need fewer lieutenants to come on active duty.''
   Wincup said the Army also faces increasing budget pressures as
Congress tries to reshape the nation's defenses in line with a
collapsing Soviet-bloc military threat.
   The elimination of 50 ROTC units will save the Army about $23
million a year, Wincup said, and will cost the jobs of 740 Army
personnel involved in the programs.
   He said he could not estimate how many cadets would be affected,
but he said the Army's aim was to reduce the total number of
graduating ROTC cadets to about 6,000 a year from about 7,800.
   After the 50 ROTC units are closed, the Army will have 363 units
left in 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and
Guam. Eleven units were closed earlier this year.
   Wincup said cadets who are in one of the units to be closed next
year but not scheduled to graduate by then will be guaranteed a
place in an ROTC program on a nearby campus only if they are on a
scholarship. Others wishing to continue in a program will have to
arrange their own transfers, he said.

   Conservative leaders are muttering about
running a candidate in 1992 if President Bush doesn't toe their
line.
   ``It is too early to tell what any of us is going to do,''
Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said at a
news conference Friday.
   But if Bush ``stays in his present course he will be challenged
in 1992, almost certainly in the Republican primaries and certainly
in the general election,'' Phillips added.
   The chief complaint is the president's abandonment of his ``no
new taxes'' pledge, which the conservatives fear will hurt
Republican candidates.
   Bush has ``dealt a crippling blow to his own credibility,'' said
David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a
Bush presidential campaign manager in 1980.
   ``We believe ... that it was because of us that he got elected,
and we need reassurance,'' said L. Brent Bozell III, executive
director of the Conservative Victory Committee.
   ``Whenever there's a close presidential race and the Republican
nominee abandons his conservative voters, they lose,'' said Richard
A. Viguerie, president of United Conservatives of America.
   Viguerie cited as examples the races of 1948, when New York Gov.
Thomas A. Dewey lost to President Truman; 1960, when Richard Nixon
lost to John Kennedy; and 1976, when President Ford lost to Jimmy
Carter.
   Viguerie, Bozell, Keene, Phillips and John Cregan, president of
the U.S. Business and Industrial Council, held their new conference
to coincide with a meeting of the Republican National Committee in
Chicago. RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said she had not seen the
conservative remarks and could not comment on them.
   The five conservatives released a letter to party Chairman Lee
Atwater protesting that the administration had, in effect, told
conservatives ``that it does not intend to honor the commitments
made to the American people in the 1988 presidential campaign.''

<HEAD>Congressional Testimony: Blood Supply Safer, But Not Safe Enough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America could have ``much to fear in the
future,'' as blood banks fail to ensure a safe, AIDS-free blood
supply, witnesses told a congressional subcommittee.
   But Stephen Richards, senior vice president of the American Red
Cross, told reporters the United States ``has the safest blood
supply of any country in the world.''
   Witnesses before the panel Friday laid much of the blame on the
blood industry, charging that thousands of people became infected
with the AIDS virus through blood transfusions because the industry
reacted too slowly to the epidemic.
   Based on blood banks' past performance, the nation could ``have
much to fear in the future,'' said Ross Eckert, a member of the
Food and Drug Administration's Blood Products Advisory Committee.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, said that according to FDA
inspection reports, some American Red Cross blood centers have
released infected blood, mixed up records or violated AIDS testing
procedures.
   ``The American Red Cross, which collects over half of all the
whole blood in the United States, has had serious and persistent
problems with its procedures for testing and keeping track of this
blood,'' Dingell said.
   Earlier this week, an FDA inspection report showed that the Red
Cross had failed to comply with its own procedures by informing the
FDA of only four of 228 cases of possible AIDS-related transfusions.
   Richards dismissed criticism that the Red Cross has failed to
educate the public about the spread of AIDS and has moved too
slowly in instituting donor screening programs. The risk of
becoming infected with the AIDS virus through a transfusion is
about 1 in 40,000, he said.
   ``We can assure the public it (the blood supply) is safer now
than ever,'' he said. ``It is as safe as it can be with medical
science and testing.''
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control, 3,425
transfusion-associated AIDS cases had been reported to the agency
as of May 1.
   The Red Cross notes that only 11 of those cases have been
diagnosed since blood banks began testing donated blood for AIDS in
1985.
   However, it can take as long as 10 years for infection with the
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, to become full-blown AIDS.
   The blood industry was reluctant early in the epidemic to screen
high-risk donors and implement safety testing because it feared
these steps ``would threaten the financial viability of a blood
bank,'' said Dr. Marcus Conant, a professor at the University of
California Medical Center in San Francisco.
   While donors give blood voluntarily and free, their blood is
sold by blood banks to hospitals and patients.
   Conant and other witnesses told the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee that blood banks knew in early 1983
that AIDS was likely transmitted by blood.
   Dr. Edgar Engleman, medical director of the Stanford University
medical school's blood bank, said his facility was criticized by
other blood banks when in July 1983 it became the first in the
nation to screen donated blood with a test designed to reduce
transfusion transmission of AIDS.
   Critics argued ``that there was no proof that AIDS could be
transmitted by blood transfusion and that the test we were using
was experimental and too costly,'' he said in his testimony.

   The Soviet Union has assured West

   The statement came after the conservative West German newspaper
Berliner Morgenpost, citing unnamed West German government sources,
said Tuesday that between 20,000 and 30,000 tons of toxic weapons
were stored at six to eight top-secret locations in East Germany.
   East German defense officials denied the newspaper report.
   The Soviet response was delivered to the Foreign Ministry in
Bonn by Soviet Ambassador Vladislav Terechov, a ministry spokesman

Soviets offered to allow inspections of any site considered suspect.
   ``The federal government is very satisfied about the quick

<HEAD>Appropriations Committee Virtually Eliminates Crop Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee, while
approving $50.4 billion for agriculture spending in fiscal 1991, is
angering House Agriculture Committee leaders by virtually
eliminating crop insurance.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., whose Agriculture subcommittee has
been working on improvements to the crop insurance program, said
Friday an amendment to restore funding would be offered during full
House debate if the program is not reinstated sooner.
   ``Abolishing the program while major improvements are under
consideration creates a situation whereby those improvements cannot
be put into effect in an orderly manner,'' Agriculture Committee
Chairman Kika de la Garza said in a letter to Appropriations
Chairman Jamie Whitten.
   The letter also was signed by English, Rep. Edward Madigan,
R-Ill., and Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.
   Madigan is ranking Republican on the full Agriculture Committee
and Coleman the ranking GOP member on English's subcommittee.
   Meanwhile, congressional leaders said the Senate expects to
start debate next week on the 1990 farm bill, with budget
constraints as the guiding force in determining the agriculture
policy for the next five years.

<HEAD>House Votes to Freeze Office Expenses of Former Presidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House wants to freeze spending on office
expenses of former presidents amid complaints they are millionaires
who already receive generous pensions.
   ``With this government tottering on the financial brink of
disaster, taxpayers in this country might wonder about the sanity
of forcing them to give a half a million dollars each to four
wealthy men who are already collecting $107,000 each in pensions,''
said Rep. Andy Jacobs, D-Ind.
   The action came on amendments to a $20.7 billion appropriations
bill for fiscal 1991 spending by the Treasury Department, Postal
Service, the office of the president and independent agencies.
   The bill provides new authority for the U.S. Secret Service to
join the FBI in investigating savings-and-loan fraud.
   It authorizes 300 new Secret Service agents _ a 50 percent
increase for the agency _ to join the 600 FBI agents at work in the
S&amp;L scandals.
   The Secret Service, while known for protecting the president,
has long been responsible for investigating counterfeiting and
securities, credit card and computer fraud.
   The bill, approved on a 300-72 vote, goes to the Senate.
   Jacobs, a frequent critic of taxpayer spending on former
presidents, tried to amend the bill by slashing all office expenses
for former presidents, totaling nearly $1.6 million.
   But the House voted 300-91 to amend Jacobs' amendment so that it
freezes the office expenditure at 1990 levels. That represents a
cut of 8 percent, $156,000, in the total spending on former
presidents, including their $107,300 a year pensions.
   Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan
receive pensions and benefits.

<HEAD>45,000 Bottles of Solution Recalled</HEAD>

   More than 45,000 bottles of a prescription eye
solution are being recalled because that may be contaminated with
bacteria that could cause a sight-threatening infection in a
scratched eye, officials say.
   The product made by Fisons Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., is
Opticrom, generically known as cromolyn sodium, in a 4 percent
ophthalmic solution. It is sold in 10 milliliter bottles, the Food
and Drug Administration said.
   The two lots being recalled are KF7A and KF35V. The lot
identification appears on the bottom of the bottle and also on the
flap of the cardboard container the bottle comes in.
   The FDA advises consumers to return bottles in these lots to
their pharmacies. The solution is prescribed to treat several rare
eye conditions.
   Testing by Fisons PLC Pharmaceutical Division in the United
Kingdom found Bacillus cereus in lot KF7A, and an unidentified
bacillus in the other lot, the FDA said.
   Both lots were distributed nationwide and in Puerto Rico. The
FDA said that about 114 bottles of KF7A and 45,223 bottles of KF35V
were distributed.

<HEAD>`From Here to Eternity' Even Steamier in Original</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1950s, readers of ``From Here to
Eternity'' were shocked by its strong language and sexy scenes. But
even steamier was author James Jones' original manuscript, a
professor who found it says.
   Editors from Scribners publishing house in New York forced Jones
to rewrite many lewd passages and tone down the language in the
book about Army life in 1941.
   ``It was heavily edited. Scribners was afraid of what would
happen if the language was not toned down,'' University of Illinois
English professor George Hendrick said Thursday night. ``Rightly
so, given the times. It was 1950. Censors would have banned it.''
   Hendrick, who found the 1,300-page manuscript while gathering
Jones' letters for a 1989 collection ``To Reach Eternity,'' said
the original work was superior to what was published.
   ``I think it is a better book. The language is grittier, more
reflective of Army speech in prewar Hawaii than the one Scribners
published. The scenes were much better the way Jones wrote them,
too,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Urbana,
Ill.
   Jones, who was stationed in Hawaii while serving in the Army in
prewar Hawaii, complained about the editing demands but gave in
because it was his first novel, Hendrick said.
   ``I'm not blaming Scribners. They had to do what they did,''
Hendrick said.
   Even more sanitized than the novel was the blockbuster movie
based on the book, starring Burt Lancaster and Frank Sinatra.
   ``There are major changes. It's a good story but not one Jones
wrote. The scene on the beach usually appears in film histories,''
said Hendrick, referring to the torrid scene between Lancaster and
Deborah Kerr in the Hawaiian surf.
   If the book were published in 1990, Hendrick said, no changes
would be made in the manuscript.
   ``Absolutely, it would be published today as it was,'' he added.
``It was a wonderful novel,'' he said.
   But he thinks Jones wrote an even better novel.
   ```The Thin Red Line' was even better. It was not as popular,
but Jones had learned a tremendous lot by having written his first
novel,'' said Hendrick, who met Jones in 1962 when the author was
touring Europe.
   After ``From Here to Eternity'' was published in 1951, Jones,
who died in 1977 at age 55, gave the manuscript to Lowney Handy as
a birthday gift.
   Mrs. Handy, Jones' lover, operated a writers' colony in his
southern Illinois hometown of Robinson, Hendrick said.
   He fictionalized the affair with Mrs. Handy in his second novel,
``Some Came Running.'' But during a visit to New York for its
publication, he met Gloria Mosolino and they married.
   Jones wanted the manuscript back, but Mrs. Handy refused, and
after her death in 1964, relatives stored the document in a garage.
   It ended up in a bank vault, where Hendrick found it.
   Widow Gloria Jones and daughter Kaylie were on hand in April for
ceremonies in connection with the University of Illinois'
acquisition of the manuscript.
   ``It was the first time they had seen the manuscript. They were
pleased to see it and have it in the hands of an institution,''
said Hendrick.

<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are one signature
short of the 12 needed to demand the appointment of a special
prosecutor to examine the collapse of a savings and loan led by
Neil Bush.
   Meanwhile, former Rep. Thomas L. Ashley said Friday he has been
regularly advising President Bush's son on his savings and loan
troubles as a longtime family friend _ but not at the president's
request.
   Neil Bush told federal regulators last December that Ashley, a
banking industry official who was a college classmate of the
president's, ``apparently, you know, called my father, and then so
at Dad's request he called me.''
   Ashley confirmed in a telephone interview he has talked to the
president about Neil Bush but said he contacted the son on his own
after reading of his troubles in the newspaper. He said President
Bush was well aware of his activity.
   Rep. Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, withdrew his name Friday from a
petition to trigger the independent counsel law in the Neil Bush
case, leaving Democrats one short of the 12 signatures needed to
trigger the independent counsel law.
   The law requires the signature of at least 12 Democrats, a
majority of the 21 on the committee, to make the request for a
special prosecutor.
   Andrea Camp, a spokeswoman for Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who
is organizing the Democratic effort, said, ``I don't think it's a
question of whether we get another signature, but when. It's a live
proposal.''
   Feighan wrote in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
``Although I had originally signed a draft of this request, I
notified the authors of the letter earlier today that my name and
signature should be withdrawn from the document that would be
delivered to you.''
   He did not indicate why he had changed his mind.
   And Democratic House Speaker Thomas S. Foley lashed back at a
Republican official's accusation that the Democrats were to blame
for a national S&amp;L crisis expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of
billions of dollars.
   Ed Rollins, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, said the Democrats had sold out ``for a few million
dollars in campaign contributions.'' But the normally mild-mannered
Foley, D-Wash., angrily dismissed Rollins as ``in a panic ... an
out of control person'' making an ``unrestrained and totally raw
partisan accusation.''
   Tempers on all sides have risen as more attention has been given
to Neil Bush, who faces a public disciplinary hearing before
federal regulators in September on his role as a director of the
bankrupt Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan.
   He has been accused of conflict of interest but has said he has
done nothing wrong. His father, the president, has twice defended
his ``honor and integrity'' during news conferences but has
promised to stay out of the investigation.
   Neil Bush's statement to federal regulators is contained in a
deposition included in documents released by the Office of Thrift
Supervision. It was first reported Friday in The Denver Post.
   Asked by the regulators whether he had ever discussed operations
of the S&amp;L with his father, the younger Bush replied:
   ``I didn't discuss details with him. And if he inquired about
Silverado, it would have been very rare, I mean if at all, and I
don't know if I ever voluntarily disclosed to him when I was a
member of the board anything about the goings on of Silverado.''
   He added, ``I never, I can state this with great clarity, that I
never intentionally brought him into, you know, I mean I never
asked him for assistance or advice on Silverado matters.''
   In response to the regulators' questions, Neil Bush said no one
had suggested to him what his testimony on any matter should be.
   Schroeder one of the petition signers among the Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee, said their request for a special prosecutor
was made because ``the people have a right to feel we're doing
everything to get impartial justice done.''
   She said there is a public sense that in the S&amp;L mess and now
the aftermath, ``it's who you know, not what you know or what
you've done.''
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said, ``The letter is
under consideration as provided for under the independent counsel
statutes.''
   Thornburgh has 15 days to decide whether to open a preliminary
inquiry to determine if a special prosecutor should be appointed,
then another 15 days to tell Congress how he acted on its request.
He has 90 days from start of the preliminary inquiry to determine
whether to appoint an independent counsel.
   Ashley, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio, said Friday,
``I've talked to the president (about his son's situation) on a
couple of social occasions, when we're alone. ... I talk about the
kids. Neil's one of the kids.''
   Ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank
regulation made him a good source of advice for Neil Bush. ``The
situation is such that he can't go to his father and talk to him,''
Ashley said.
   Ashley, who was a college classmate of George Bush's at Yale,
denied President Bush had asked him to intervene. He said, ``If
Neil thinks his father called me, he's mistaken.''
   Ashley, 67, is president of the Association of Bank Holding
Companies, a banking lobbying organization based in Washington. The
organization generally does not get involved in savings and loan
issues, Ashley said.
   He said he contacted Neil Bush on his own last winter after
reading about his troubles in newspapers.
   Since then, ``I've seen Neil a half dozen times. We talk about
it,'' Ashley said.
   He said he is not trying to serve as a go-between for Neil Bush
and the president, nor trying to influence any decisions. ``I'm too
smart for that,'' Ashley said.
   Ashley and Bush have remained close friends since they were both
members of the secret society Skull and Bones while they were
undergraduates at Yale University in the late 1940s.
   ``Is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay
away from Neil?'' Ashley asked. President Bush ``doesn't go along
with that. He rejects that,'' the former lawmaker added.
   Ashley said that Neil Bush has made up his own mind in the
matter, including his decision to fight the case and refusal to
negotiate an out-of-court settlement.
   ``I'm a good sounding board,'' he said. ``It's not a partisan
matter or he wouldn't be coming to a Democrat.''

   Officials have decided to install a
flashing, warning light to alert motorists to traffic jams when
President Bush is in town.
   ``It might save local people time and some aggravation,'' Police
Chief John Prescott said.
   The light will be put up on a trial basis along Ocean Avenue
through Labor Day, officials said Thursday. Depending on how it
goes, the warning may be installed permanently.
   Residents have grown weary of delays of up to 45 minutes when
Bush visits his summer estate and presidential checkpoints are set
up. Delays vary in duration, depending on whether Bush boards his
boat, plays tennis or takes a jog, Prescott said.
   Tourists compound the problem.
   The Bush warning is expected to cost about $1,000. The cost will
be shared by the town and the Cape Arundel Neighborhood Association.

<HEAD>Black Mother Wants Children Placed With White Foster Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A black woman who wants her two children placed
with a white suburban couple is opposed by social workers who
believe they belong in the same socioeconomic environment as their
mother _ the inner city.
   A final decision was postponed Friday when attorneys told a
children's court judge they might be able to reach an out-of-court
agreement on placement of the 5-month-old girl and her 14-month-old
sister.
   The children's mother wants them to stay with a white foster
family. The Milwaukee County Department of Health and Social
Services says a black family environment would be better.
   The older girl is already with a black foster mother after
living temporarily with a white family in nearby Oak Creek. Both
children were taken from their mother in February because she was
declared financially unable to ``maintain a proper home,'' said
Jeff Aikin, a department spokesman.
   The 30-year-old mother has not been named in court papers to
protect her children's identities.
   She petitioned the court to have her children placed with David
and Beverly Cox at their Delafield home in suburban Waukesha
County. The Coxes said they were eager to care for the children
until their mother is ready to be reunited with them.
   ``I am looking forward to the day I can take the children to her
and say, `Take over, we've done a good job,''' Mrs. Cox said. But
Judge Ronald Goldberger ruled last month the Coxes have no legal
standing in the case.
   Aikin said the black foster family chosen by the department
meets several ``conditions that are important. They're of the same
race, the same socioeconomic status and they live nearby (the
mother).''
   Roselyn Clipps, vice president of the Wisconsin Association of
Black Social Workers, said black children raised with white
families lack role models ``who truly understand what
Afro-Americans have been going through historically and are still
going through.''
   Michael Vruno, the children's court-appointed lawyer, originally
favored moving the younger child to the black home chosen by social
workers.
   But he told Goldberger after a 3{-hour attorneys' conference
Friday that new information led him to ``alter his position
somewhat.'' He would not elaborate.
   Victoria Schroeder, the Coxes' attorney, said there may be a
settlement.
   Goldberger adjourned the hearing until Aug. 16, saying the
younger child can stay with the Coxes at least until then.
   The girls' 12-year-old brother lives with an aunt. A 3-year-old
brother lives with another aunt.
   Aikin said that of about 1,680 foster homes licensed by the
department, 60 percent are black and 35 percent are white, almost a
reversal of the ratio of three years ago.

   A convicted rapist has been indicted on
murder charges in the slayings of six young women and teen-agers
whose bodies were found in shallow, desert graves.
   David Leonard Wood, 33, of El Paso was charged Friday after new
evidence was presented to a grand jury, said District Attorney
Steve Simmons.
   Wood, who is serving a 50-year sentence for a 1987 rape, has
filed a lawsuit saying investigators are using him as a scapegoat
to counter criticism they did not move quickly enough in the case.
   The decayed remains of the victims, ranging in age from 14 to
23, were found in shallow graves within a half-mile of each other
in the desert about 18 miles northeast of El Paso between Sept. 4,
1987, and March 14, 1988.
   Some were runaways or prostitutes. Police were criticized for
not responding more quickly to reports of their disappearances.
   ``I'm sure if we felt earlier on that we were involved with a
serial killing, police would have handled it differently,'' Simmons
said.
   Simmons would not detail the new evidence leading to Wood's
indictment.
   Wood had been mentioned before as a suspect. He denied killing
anyone and last year filed the $20.5 million lawsuit against Police
Chief John Scagno, claiming police schemed to implicate him because
they could not solve the case.
   The lawsuit is pending.
   The indictment said one of the victims was stabbed several
times, but the medical examiner was unable to determine how most
were killed because their bodies were decomposed.

   A fire that continued to smolder early today
turned a subway tunnel under construction into a 1,500-degree oven
and collapsed a stretch near a downtown freeway.
   Six workers in the tunnel smelled smoke and escaped unharmed
Friday.
   The Metro Rail subway project aimed at bringing underground mass
transit to some of the nation's most congested streets was already
plagued by delays and cost overruns before the fire brought it
further behind schedule.
   Up to three miles of the heavily traveled Hollywood Freeway
looked like a parking lot Friday morning, when hundreds of
thousands of commuters were mired on their way to work. Others
alerted to the problem simply stayed home.
   The fire collapsed a 100-foot stretch of tunnel within 10 feet
of where it passes under the freeway. About three miles of the
highway was closed because of the fire and was to remain that way
into next week.
   The section of tunnel under the freeway was a charred core of
twisted steel and burned timber, officials said.
   The fire roared through the 750-foot tunnel, fueled by lumber
and plastic sheeting that covered excavated earth, city fire
spokesman Gary Svider said.
   Firefighters could not venture into the tunnel to battle the
flames for more than 12 hours.
   ``Any time you're in a tunnel, you're basically in an oven,''
said Robert Ramirez, an assistant fire chief.
   With temperatures reaching 1,500 degrees in some spots,
firefighters in breathing gear were sent in.
   ``If hell was like this, I think I would go to church more
often,'' said firefighter John Gonzalez.
   Dozens of firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion. The
stubborn blaze smoldered early today, sending up a huge plume of
white smoke.
   The Hollywood Freeway is a stretch of U.S. Highway 101, which
links Northern and Southern California and the downtown area with
the a host of suburbs.
   No commuters were hurt.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   The Metro Rail already was 18 months behind schedule. The $1.3
billion, 4-mile subway project was scheduled to open in 1993.
   The fire was not expected to affect today's inaugural run of the
22-mile Blue Line light rail trolleys that runs on surface lines
between Los Angeles and Long Beach.

   Prosecutors fighting delays in the trial of
a winery worker accused of killing his wife, two daughters and four
other people don't object to the latest week-long postponement.
   Superior Court Judge Phrasel Shelton on Friday granted the delay
in the trial of Ramon Salcido until July 23 after his attorney,
Marteen Miller, made a last-minute plea for time, telling the judge
his wife was ill with malaria.
   The district attorney's office didn't protest the move during a
court session in Redwood City, where the trial was to begin Monday
with jury selection.
   ``The request was based on the illness of Mr. Miller's wife and
she was hospitalized so we didn't object,'' said Deputy District
Attorney Mike Mullins. ``We're ready to go, however.''
   On Thursday, a state appeals court refused without explanation
to grant Miller a two-month trial delay until September.
   Miller has said he needs time to convince Mexican authorities to
hand over extradition papers that could prevent prosecutors from
seeking the death penalty. But prosecutors have argued that Miller
is simply trying to delay the case and there's no truth to the
argument that a U.S.-Mexico treaty bars the death penalty in the
case.
   The trial was moved from Sonoma County, the area north of San
Francisco where the slayings occurred, to San Mateo, south of the
city, because of pre-trial publicity.
   Salcido, 29, is accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his
mother-in-law, her two daughters and a co-worker 15 months ago.
   A third daughter, who was two years old, had her throat slit but
survived and has since been living with a foster family.
   Miller said he doesn't plan to dispute the facts in the case.
Salcido gave a full confession to police shortly after he was
arrested in Mexico, where he fled. But Miller said he plans to
fight the death penalty by arguing that Salcido was drunk and high
on cocaine at the time of the slayings and that he had some sort of
mental disturbance.
   Superior Court Judge Reginald Littrell, who will preside over
the trial, said he expects jury selection to take about six weeks,
followed by at least one month for the rest of the trial.

   In an era of Hubble trouble and sputtering
shuttles, astronomers get by with a little help from their friends
_ amateur stargazers who sometimes find bright lights the
professionals miss.
   While most major discoveries in the universe are made by
astronomers using jumbo telescopes, hobbyists sometimes come
through.
   ``The big telescopes are expensive and overbooked by the
professionals,'' says Russell Genet, an Air Force engineer and
astronomy enthusiast who lives in Mesa, Ariz.
   ``With your own home telescope, the equipment is yours. The
amateurs almost have an advantage over the professionals,'' he said.
   Genet was one of about 700 members of the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific, the nation's largest popular astronomy group, who
gathered Friday for the beginning of a six-day conference at Boston
University.
   The conventioneers, professional and amateur alike, came
equipped with calculators and slide rules, ready for speeches with
titles like ``The Birth of Binary Stars'' and ``Astrophotography
Made Easy.''
   Andrew Fraknoi, executive director of the San Francisco-based
group, says it has been a mix of scientists and enthusiasts right
from the start.
   In 1889, thousands flocked to the West Coast where a solar
eclipse was visible. There were only three astronomers in
California at the time, so they enlisted the aid of amateur
starwatchers to help track the event and explain it to the
spellbound crowds. The astronomical society was formed from that
coalition.
   Those may now seem like the good old days. In the 1990s
astronomers must fight for money, telescope time and, with NASA's
recent embarrassing setbacks, respectability.
   The Hubble space-based telescope has not produced clear images
because of flaws in one of its massive mirrors. NASA's entire space
shuttle fleet is grounded because of persistent leaks from hydrogen
fuel tanks.
   Frank Drake, an astronomer at the University of California,
Santa Cruz who led the first radio search for extraterrestrial life
in the 1960s, recently had his proposal for a continued search
ridiculed in Congress.
   The House axed the program's proposed $12 million budget. The
Senate had not yet taken up the measure.
   ``We are being affected by the backlash of NASA's troubles,''
says Drake. Movie makers ``spend millions on `Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,' but we can't get $12 million to do the real
thing.''
   As in 1889, home stargazers are helping. As access to
observatories becomes more tightly allocated, amateur astronomers
increasingly lend a hand, occasionally catching things the pros
miss.
   Genet has discovered 12 variable stars, suns that emit varying
amounts of light. He says that while stargazing alone is
satisfying, there's nothing like the thrill of actually finding a
bright new light in the cosmos.
   ``You always have this itch to make some addition to man's
knowledge, a desire to contribute to that edifice,'' Genet says.
``You get hooked on this great tradition of science, and you want
to add your little piece.''
   Robert Fried was a pilot for Delta Airlines before he retired
four years ago to pursue his interest in stargazing full-time.
   ``I've known people with Ph.D.s in astronomy who didn't know
which end of a telescope to look in,'' he says. ``And I've seen
some amateurs who were pretty sharp.''
   Fried, 59, built a 16-inch mini-observatory at his home in
Flagstaff, Ariz. Though he admits he's no Galileo, Fried says he's
as handy with a telescope as the next academic.
   He said his telescope made the only recording of a visual light
curve, or variation in light emissions, from V404 Cygnus, an X-ray
binary star.
   ``Doing that, I started to feel like I was giving something back
to this world, instead of just taking,'' Fried says.

<HEAD>India's Prime Minister Offers To Quit Amid Political Infighting</HEAD>

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh offered to
resign today, saying he has lost the trust of the people and the
parties in his 7-month-old governing coalition.
   ``Bowing to the general sentiment, I wish to step down from the
prime ministership,'' Singh said in a letter to the president of
his Janata Dal party.
   Singh has been beset by party infighting, brought to a head by
the resignations of three Cabinet ministers on Friday.
   Critics charge that Singh's efforts to hold his party together
have diluted his efforts to tackle problems such as rising food and
gasoline prices and separatist revolts by Sikhs in Punjab and
Moslems in Kashmir.
   His National Front coalition formed a government in December
after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party lost power in
November's general elections.
   In his letter, the prime minister asked the president of his
party to call a meeting of the party's member lawmakers to choose a
new parliamentary leader. The leader in turn would seek to form a
government and become prime minister.
   But Singh himself could be re-elected the party's parliamentary
leader, a move that would enable him to continue as prime minister.
   Singh's tactic of sending his letter to the party president was
designed to keep power in his party's hands. If he had made his
resignation offer to the country's president, the opposition
Congress Party could have been asked to form a government.
   Singh's party rules as a minority government, but it is
supported by leftist and right-wing groups. The Congress Party
holds the largest number of seats in Parliament but does not have
enough for a majority.
   The resignation offer came after Singh's deputy prime minister,
Devi Lal, ignored the wishes of many in the party and installed his
son as chief minister of Haryana state on Thursday. Three of
Singh's national Cabinet ministers resigned in protest Friday night.
   ``The rationale of my being in the office of the prime minister
was the trust of the people, of the members of the National Front
and of the supporting parties,'' Singh wrote. ``The developments of
the last two days have shown that I have lost this trust.''
   The text of the letter was released by government officials.
   Gandhi's Congress Party, now the chief opposition, has been
predicting that dissent within the coalition could lead to Singh's
downfall.
   The Congress Party holds the largest number of seats in
Parliament but does not have enough for a majority.

<HEAD>Oregon Fire Spreads, Firefighters Gain Ground Elsewhere</HEAD>

   A wildfire in central Oregon firefighters thought they had
surrounded jumped fire lines and tripled in size. Firefighters
elsewhere had better success with summer blazes.
   In California, a brush fire ignited by a teen-ager playing with
a toy rocket was contained Friday and crews in Yellowstone National
Park battled flames with the help from air tankers dropping fire
retardant.
   The Oregon fire was thought to have been contained late Thursday
after blackening 600 acres of timberland, but wind blew embers past
a fire line and new flames quickly spread Friday, said state
Department of Forestry fire spokesman John Boro.
   It ballooned to 1,800 acres by early today and threatened to
expand further, he said. Reinforcements were called in to bolster a
force of 100 firefighters today.
   The fire was touched off Tuesday night in a lightning storm that
swept over the Cascade Range. After smoldering for two days, the
fire grew rapidly Thursday, moving through brush and pine forests
on private lands near Tumalo Reservoir, about six miles southeast
of Sisters, Ore.
   No structures were under immediate threat early today, but
firefighters closely watched the blaze's progress toward a ranch in
its path, officials said.
   Lightning storms this week started about 300 fires in Oregon.
Most have been doused or encircled by fire lines, officials said.
   Humidity helped firefighters contain a 6,500-acre brush fire in
California that was sparked by a toy rocket.
   ``At this point it's not going anywhere. If weather conditions
stay the same, it looks pretty good,'' said Orange County fire
spokeswoman Maria Sobol. A lack of wind as well as moisture in the
air aided 700 firefighters.
   A 15-year-old Yorba Linda boy was questioned for investigation
of unlawful use of a model rocket. It is illegal for a minor to use
such rockets without supervision.
   The teen-ager, released to his family, told officials the rocket
malfunctioned and crashed into dry brush. He tried to stamp the
fire out, suffering minor burns to his leg, then called 911.
   In Washington, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Ron Dehart said
most of the 55 small lightning fires in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie
National Forest have either been put out or brought under control.
   In Wyoming on Friday, more than 80 firefighters battled
Yellowstone's 12th fire of the year.

   Trust in the United States that Hmong
people developed as they fought alongside Americans during the
Vietnam War is strained by a dispute over corrective surgery for a
boy born with clubfeet, a Hmong leader says.
   Social workers want to force surgery on 6-year-old Kou Xiong to
repair the condition and another birth defect, a dislocated hip.
The boy's parents believe spirits inflicted the deformities on him
to punish the family for an ancestor's wrongs.
   Operating on the boy against his parent's wishes would amount to
religious persecution, Hmong leaders say.
   Acting on the advice of a shaman, or religious leader, the boy's
parents say trying to correct the defects could bring more divine
retribution against the family _ possibly including Kou's death.
   Neither defect is life-threatening, and the boy, born with the
deformities in a Thai refugee camp, can walk and play with other
children. He also opposes the surgery, believing he is serving the
family by living with his condition.
   But county social workers won a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last
month to force surgery on the advice of doctors who say the boy
likely will become crippled otherwise.
   Kou's parents have won a stalemate, however, because no hospital
will undertake the operation without their consent. Now the boy's
father's lawyer is trying to have the case dismissed.
   ``This Xiong case has become a concern of the Hmong people
across the country because that is something that involves the
culture and religion of the Hmong people,'' said Dang Vang,
president of the Hmong Human Rights Committee in Fresno.
   Hmongs are an ethnic minority within Laos, living mainly in the
mountainous north. They fought with Americans during the Vietnam
war, and tens of thousands fled communist persecution afterward.
   Most maintain Animist beliefs that include faith in a pantheon
of spirits thought to control human events.
   Like many Hmong refugees invited to relocate in the United
States since the mid-1970s, Kou's father, Ger Xiong, now 40, spent
his youth working as a medic or fighting during the Vietnam War.
   About 75,000 Hmong came to the United States. An estimated
50,000 live in California. Other large Hmong communities formed in
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
   ``The United States had been involved with the Hmong people
during the war and (the Hmong) had some kind of relationship with
the American people,'' Vang said. ``So that motivated the Hmong
people into a trust. The Hmong people feel like the United States
is a country of freedom, peace and justice.''
   Now, he said, ``We just feel like we are here in somebody's
country and they can do whatever they want to do and we have no
rights.''
   ``This case in Fresno is a telling case because it has brought
to the fore a lot of tensions between the host and the newcomer,''
said Eric Crystal, director of Southeast Asian Studies at
University of California, Berkeley.
   ``Their main agenda is not rapidly assimilating into the
American culture. They are people who have struggled through
thousands of years of history to maintain this identity,'' Crystal
said.
   The Xiongs consider the battle as much of a threat to their
personal safety as the war that forced them to flee Laos.
   ``This is no kind of fight for them after what they have been
through,'' said Monte James, a law clerk for the firm representing
Ger Xiong.

<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. experts will travel to Cambodia
July 24 to examine the remains of what may be U.S. servicemen
unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, says Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va.
   Robb, a Vietnam veteran, visited Cambodia earlier this year to
appeal for cooperation in obtaining an accounting of the 83
Americans missing and believed dead in that country.
   The visit is the first of its kind since the communist triumph
in Cambodia in 1975.
   Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of leading senators, fearing a
return of the Khmer Rouge to power, has drafted a letter urging
President Bush to change the administration's policy toward
Cambodia.
   ``The president's policy in Cambodia is indefensible,'' Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a leader of the
petitioners, told reporters this week.
   ``How can we, the United States, which has already enacted into
law a prohibition on aiding the Khmer Rouge, engage in a policy
which does precisely that?'' said Mitchell.
   A draft of the letter urges Bush to open the door to some
contacts between the United States and the government of Hun Sen in
Phnom Penh.
   The United States supports a coalition of groups that are
fighting the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, who
slaughtered more than a million Cambodians when they ruled the
country in the 1970s.
   The United States has received cooperation from Vietnam and Laos
on the MIA issue. All told, the 2,302 missing Americans are
believed to be in those two countries and Cambodia.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he did not know
how many sets of remains the American experts will be invited to
examine in Cambodia.
   He said the mission was strictly humanitarian in nature. But a
senior State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
the gesture by the Cambodian government apparently was aimed at
achieving increased international recognition.
   There has been no American presence in Cambodia since the
U.S.-backed government was ousted by the Khmer Rouge rebels in
April 1975. The Khmer Rouge was ousted by Vietnamese forces in 1978
after 3{ bloody years in power.
   Boucher said that if any of the remains appear likely to be
those of Americans, a U.S. Air Force plane will repatriate them to
Hawaii for further analysis.
   ``We appreciate the support of the Phnom Penh authorities for
this undertaking, which we consider an important humanitarian
endeavor, and, if successful, will help alleviate the continued
uncertainty of the families of the missing Americans,'' Boucher
said.
   Robb, who had met with Hun Sen and other officials in Phnom
Penh, made the announcement in a speech Friday to the National
League of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which
is holding its 21st annual meeting in Washington.
   ``This is obviously only the beginning of a process which we
hope will allow for the accounting of every missing American,''
Robb said.

   PUBLIC REACTION: Hundreds of thousands of anti-Communist coal
miners went on strike July 11, ignoring an appeal from the congress
to stay on the job. At two Moscow rallies, demonstrators shouted
for the end of communism, with a protester at one of the rallies
spitting at a delegate leaving Red Square.

   HIGH DRAMA: There were two dramatic moments: on Day 1, when coal
miner Vladimir Bludov stood up nine minutes into the congress and
called for the party leadership to resign; and on Day 10, when
Boris Yeltsin strode into the Palace of Congresses and stunned a
hushed crowd by saying he was quitting the party. The speech drew
derisive whistles and shouts of ``Shame!''

<HEAD>Environmental Tie-Ins Used To Market Japanese Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The marketers of Japanese products have found a new
selling point: environmental consciousness.
   The Takashimaya Department Store in Tokyo recently designated a
slew of gift items labeled as ``generous to the Earth,'' like
stationery made from recycled paper.
   The actual environmental benefits of some supposedly
Earth-friendly products _ jams and jellies, for example _ might be
a bit of a mystery.
   But the retailers say their main aim is to raise public
awareness of about ecological issues.
   ``What we stores can do is to provide consumers opportunities to
think about the environment,'' said Kiyoshi Hasegawa, a spokesman
the Mitsukoshi department store chain, which has a sales campaign
centered on ``The Beautiful Earth.''
   Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest stockbroker, recently
introduced its Earth Environment Fund, with stock in companies
related to environmental products.
   Products such as hairsprays that do not use chloroflurocarbon
propellants and biodegradable cleansing products are making their
way onto the market.
   Non-removable tabs on beverage cans, replacing the throw-away
pull tab, were introduced only this year. That anti-litter move has
been effect for years in the United States.
   A recent fashion fad has been clothing with floral and plant
patterns. And some traditional staples of the Japanese diet, such
as buckwheat noodles, are being marketed as health foods to tie in
to the eco-marketing trend.
   The Japan Environment Association, a government group, judges
certain products as pollution-free, and awards an ``Eco-mark''
designation to be used in marketing them.
   ``Consumers should realize they can somehow live without harming
the environment,'' says Kyoko Kato, a spokeswoman for the
association.
   But there are no scientific standards for the awarding of the
Eco-mark, which has been granted to 513 products. Companies pay a
fee ranging from $250 to $660 when they submit products for
approval.
   Ms. Kato says she suggested setting up other categories of the
Eco-mark for products with some specific environmental benefit,
such as recyclable cans and bottles. But there have been no takers.
   Yoko Tomiyama, acting director of the Japan Consumer Union, said
she thought it might be more useful to identify products that are
bad for the environment.
   ``But many people just don't care,'' she said.
   Many Japanese companies are feeling pressured to show concern
for the environment, even if it's as much a matter of style as
substance.
   The Suntory brewery recently opened a trendy Tokyo eatery called
``The Earth,'' with a pink hemispheric dome. People wait hours to
get in.
   The restaurant is a tie-in to a new Suntory beer by the same
name, with a tab that sticks to the can rather than coming off to
be tossed away. Suntory says it retooled its manufacturing line to
make the cans with stay-on tabs.
   ``It's no longer socially acceptable if we care about nothing
but productivity and sales,'' said Suntory spokesman Kenji Yokomizo.

<HEAD>News Report: Eastern Airlines to Face Charges for Maintenance
Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has been told by the federal
government it will be charged with criminal violations for
allegedly altering maintenance and safety records before the
machinists strike, NBC News reported.
   Quoting unidentified sources close to Eastern, the network said
Friday the airline is considering whether to plead guilty or no
contest.
   It would be the first time an airline faced such charges over
maintenance practices, NBC reported Friday.
   A federal grand jury conducted a 10-month investigation into
allegations that Eastern altered maintenance and safety records at
New York's John F. Kennedy and La Guardia airports and at the
carrier's major hub, Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta.
   The network said Eastern managers at Kennedy and LaGuardia
allegedly told mechanics to disregard safety guidelines, then
falsified logbooks to show proper inspections were carried out.
   Eastern's bankruptcy trustee, Martin R. Shugrue, told NBC he
discussed the investigation with U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney.
   ``He sought my cooperation as trustee,'' Shugrue said. ``I
pledged it to him and the investigation is ongoing.''
   Eastern's lawyers planned to meet with Maloney on Monday to say
whether they will fight charges, the network said.
   Maloney would not comment on the case. There was no answer to
telephone calls Friday night at Eastern's offices in Miami.
   Shugrue was named trustee to run Eastern as Frank Lorenzo's
replacement while the airline tries to pull itself out of
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Machinists at Eastern have been on strike since March 1989.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Inventor Nearly $5.2 Million in Wiper Infringement
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inventor won a nearly $5.2 million judgment
against Ford Motor Co. in a 12-year battle to protect his patents
for intermittent windshield wipers.
   Robert Kearns, 63, of Gaithersburg, Md., sought $141 million,
claiming unauthorized use of his electronic work developing the
wipers that slow to make periodic passes across windshields.
   The judgment Friday was welcomed by Ford, but relatives of
Kearns said he likely would appeal.
   ``We're pleased with the verdict returned by this jury,'' Ford
spokesman Mark Miller said. ``It also saw that Dr. Kearns's
contribution to intermittent wiper technology was modest,
especially when you compare it with the contributions made by
Ford's own engineers and suppliers.''
   Kearns rejected a $30 million settlement offered by Ford in
February, said his son, Dennis Kearns.
   The inventor is suing 19 other automotive companies, including
General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz, Honda, Toyota
and Nissan.
   A federal jury ruled Jan. 29 _ nearly 12 years after Kearns
filed suit _ that Ford infringed on his patents. The same jury
found May 8 that Ford's infringement was not deliberate, but it
failed to agree on how much to award Kearns.
   A new jury heard testimony in the damages portion of the trial
and on Friday awarded $6.3 million. But U.S. District Judge Avern
Cohn ruled Kearns could be compensated only for $5,163,842,
reflecting damages incurred after April 1978, when he first filed
suit.
   Kearns spent an estimated $1.5 million on his fight, relatives
said. His son said the verdict likely will discourage other small
inventors from waging costly legal battles against large companies.

<DATELINE>KAIFENG, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this ancient center of Chinese Judaism,
a Jewish-Chinese girl from New York City marked her passage into
adulthood today with a traditional bat mitzvah ceremony.
   ``It is so unique for my heritages to be united in one place,''
said YiLing Chen-Josephson, 13, the daughter of a Jewish father and
a Chinese mother.
   Cantor David Lefkowitz incorporated a Chinese folk song into the
ceremony, held in a hotel because Kaifeng's synogogue was destroyed
in the 19th century.
   Kaifeng, about 390 miles south of Beijing in Henan province, was
once home to China's largest Jewish community.
   About 40 friends and relatives attended the ceremony, including
the U.S. ambassador to China, James Lilley, and John Kluge,
chairman of Metromedia Co., who is listed by Forbes magazine as the
richest man in America.
   YiLing's father, Marvin Josephson, is chairman of Josephson
International, parent company of International Creative Management,
one of the world's largest literary and talent agencies.
   He said he thought of holding his daughter's bat mitzvah in
Kaifeng after reading about a boy whose parents took him to Krakow,
Poland, for his bar mitzvah in memory of his grandparents who died
in the Holocaust.
   Jewish boys traditionally have bar mitzvahs at age 13 to mark
reaching adulthood. In modern times, girls also have gone through
the ceremony, called bat mitzvah.
   Today's service originally was planned for last summer, but was
postponed after the army's bloody attack on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing. Instead, YiLing had a bat mitzvah in New
York last November.
   But the family did not give up the idea of holding the ceremony
in China, which YiLing's maternal grandparents left more than four
decades ago. The grandparents returned for the first time for the
ceremony.
   YiLing said last week that coming to China ``helped me to
realize how special this is to have ... a combination of two sides
of a family like this.''
   ``Before, I just took it for granted that this is what I am,''
she said. ``Now, it's beginning to take some meaning.''
   Kaifeng was China's capital from the 10th to the 13th centuries,
at about the time Jewish traders began arriving by sea and across
Central Asia via the Silk Road.
   In the early 18th century, several thousand Jews attended the
Kaifeng synagogue each week. But by the mid-19th century, China's
Jews had become largely assimilated, speaking only Chinese and
adopting Chinese names and customs.
   A 1980 study found only 79 Jewish families totaling 166 members
still living in Kaifeng, although other accounts say the figure is
double that.
   Through intermarriage, they are virtually indistinguishable from
other Chinese, and most have no knowledge of Judaism or only dimly
remember older generations practicing some Jewish customs.

<HEAD>Secret Police Chief Predicts Speedy Escobar Capture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the secret police is
predicting the government will soon nab Pablo Escobar, the reputed
leader of the Medellin drug cartel.
   The official, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, said in an interview
published Friday in the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo that the battle
against the drug cartel is being won.
   ``The Medellin cartel's breathing room has been reduced, and we
now see some slipping at the very top, specifically with respect to
the Ochoa family,'' Maza said.
   The brothers Jorge Luis, Fabio and Juan David Ochoa have been
considered Escobar's closest allies in running the cocaine empire.
   Maza said the brothers have abandoned Escobar.
   The government has raised from $400,000 to $600,000 the reward
for information leading to the capture of the enormously wealthy
Escobar.
   About 2,000 soldiers and policemen are hunting for Escobar in
the northeastern region known as Magdalena Medio, using helicopters
and land patrols.
   Earlier in the week, police said they had Escobar surrounded,
but he escaped into the jungle. It was the third time in a year
Escobar had evaded a police dragnet.
   Since the operation began six days ago, soldiers and troops have
seized some 8,500 pounds of dynamite, assualt rifles, sophisticated
radio equipment and documents belonging to the Medellin cartel, and
about 21 cartel employees were arrested, Maza said.
   Meanwhile, police in Medellin on Friday discovered a truck in a
public parking lot loaded with about 450 pounds of dynamite.
Security forces deactivated the explosives.
   The police said the truck had been parked there for about two
weeks.
   So far this year, five powerful car bombs have exploded in
Medellin, killing at least 60 people. Officials blamed the drug
traffickers, who have been locked in an 11-month-old war against
the government.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Colombia's president-elect Cesar
Gaviria said the United States must curb its appetite for drugs
before his nation can significantly stem illegal cocaine production.
   Gaviria told reporters Friday after meeting with President Bush
that ``the demand for drugs is the engine of the trafficking
problem. If the United States and the industrial countries don't
get a way to reduce consumption, we will not solve the problem.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the two presidents
had discussed the administration's pending proposal for $80.5
million in drug-fighting assistance to Colombia.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Moody to be Held Without Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MACON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The target of an FBI investigation into a pair
of fatal mail bombings will be jailed in secrecy until his trial on
unrelated witness tampering charges, authorities said.
   Judge Wilbur D. Owens Jr. on Friday ordered Walter Leroy Moody
Jr., 56, held without bail until his trial. He also ruled that
Moody's wife, Susan McBride Moody, 28, could be released on a
$250,000 property bond.
   A tentative Sept. 17 trial date was scheduled for Moody.
   U.S. Marshal Bill Breese said security precautions prevented him
from saying where Moody would be housed until the trial.
   The Moodys were arrested Tuesday and charged in a 13-count
federal indictment with conspiracy, obstruction of justice,
subornation of perjury, bribery of a witness and tampering with a
witness.
   The charges arose from Moody's alleged attempts to erase a 1972
conviction for explosives possession after a pipe bomb injured a
previous wife.
   Moody spent nearly three years in prison, but always contended
that an acquaintance made the bomb and left it in his house without
his knowledge.
   More than a decade later a woman testified that she was with the
acquaintance the day he allegedly left the package at Moody's home.
   She later recanted the story. Prosecutors say Moody bribed and
intimidated her into giving the false testimony.
   The materials used in the 1972 pipe bomb reportedly were similar
to those found in four December mail bombs, one of which killed a
federal judge while another killed a lawyer.
   At one point Friday, Owens closed the hearing after a prosecutor
mentioned the mail bombings. He pointed out that neither defendant
has been indicted in those bombings.
   The Moodys' home had been searched earlier by federal agents
investigating the mail bombings. It was searched again on Tuesday.
Moody has denied any connection with the bombings.
   Letters claiming responsibility for the mail bombs said they
were sent by a racist hate group.

<HEAD>Rikers Island Cellblock Vendetta Sparks Brawl, 39 Guards Hurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slashing of a cellblock Muslim leader
sparked a melee at Rikers Island that injured 39 guards and 56
inmates as prisoners sought revenge for the knifing attack,
authorities said.
   Fighting broke out Friday afternoon when a group of inmates at
the maximum-security lockup stormed the cell of the inmate accused
of slashing their religious leader, said Correction Department
spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.
   Sixty inmates took part in the brawl. Nine were taken to area
hospitals and 47 were seen treated at a jail clinic for minor
injuries, Ryles said.
   Seventeen weapons were recovered in the cellblock hallway after
the fight, she said.
   The fight stemmed from the Thursday night slashing of Andrew
Jackson, 26, by Rolando Gonzalez, 24, Ryles said. Jackson is the
imam, or spiritual leader, of the prison's Muslim population.
   Forty-eight Muslim prisoners were returning from religious
services around 3 p.m. when they passed Gonzalez's cellblock.
   ``They tried to crash the block and get their revenge on
Gonzalez,'' she said. A dozen inmates in the hallway clashed with
the Muslim prisoners and 50 correction officers were called in to
subdue the brawlers.
   Most of the 39 injured officers were taken to local hospitals
for treatment. The severity of injuries was not immediately
available, she said.
   Correction officers were searching inmates and their cells for
additional weapons. It was unclear what prompted the Thursday night
fight between Jackson and Gonzalez, Ryles said.
   The brawl erupted in one of nine maximum-security city jails on
the island in the East River.
   Ryles said Gonzales is serving a 15-years-to-life sentence in
state prison for murder and Jackson is serving 25 years to life,
also for murder.
   Both men were being held at Rikers so they can testify at
ongoing court proceedings against them, she said.

<TEXT>
   The trolley, which gasped its last in this
smoggy city three decades ago, is reincarnated today as part of a
$10 billion effort to wean Angelenos from the automobile.
   The 22-mile Metro Blue Line is an overhead-powered trolley
system running between downtown and Long Beach, financed by a
half-cent county sales tax approved by voters in 1980.
   Actually, it is a reinvention of the old Pacific Electric Red
Car line that began covering the very same route 90 years ago.
   Those trains _ nostalgically recalled in the movie ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit'' _ were derailed in 1961 by a city that had become
hopelessly hooked on cars.
   The movie's plot _ in which the Red Car line is destroyed _
mimicked real life, in which automakers managed to sideline the
trolley in favor of buses and other gas-guzzlers.
   Although sleeker and faster than its predecessor, the Blue Line
could be sidetracked itself by a 1990s problem. Many neighborhoods
along the 22-stop route are now among the most gang-infested in the
city, prompting some critics to dub it ``a streetcar named
disaster.''
   The $877 million line is the first part of a $10 billion,
150-mile rail grid planned into the next century for Los Angeles,
which is ribboned by freeways so jammed that the simplest commute
can take an hour or more. As a result, the area generates some of
the worst air pollution in the country.
   Included in the proposed grid is the $1.3 billion Metro Rail
subway, which suffered a setback Friday when fire ravaged a
maintenance tunnel under construction. The first 4-mile segment was
scheduled to open in 1993.
   In order to spur public interest, the Blue Line will offer free
introductory rides over the weekend, with thousands expected to
attend what one official called a ``20-mile-long block party.''
   Others are in a less festive mood, including merchants who claim
security fences along the rail line are blocking their customers.
   While bus riders are likely to prefer the train, getting
Angelenos out of their beloved automobiles is the real challenge.
   ``The key to success is how well we do in attracting the rider
who has alternatives, who has some other way to get around other
than public transit,'' said Edward McSpedon of the Los Angeles
County Transportation Commission.
   ``As far as organized gang activity, there hasn't been any,''
said county sheriff's Capt. Frank Vadurro. ``Maybe they don't even
know about it.''
   Vadurro is in charge of the 118-deputy force contracted to guard
the Blue Line. Deputies will ride trains in uniform and undercover,
but not every train will include a deputy.
   An estimated 15,000 gang members live within a 2-mile-wide strip
along the rail line, 22 percent of all gangsters in the county,
Vadurro said. Since November, 300 arrests have already been made by
the transit force for crimes such as narcotics, vandalism and theft.
   ``We have made an overinvestment in security,'' McSpedon said.
``We want to make sure that security is not even a factor in the
rider's mind.''
   A computerized control room dubbed the USS Enterprise includes
an arc of color screens showing the progress of each train, and a
bank of 64 television monitors keep an eye on the 22 stations.
   Operators of the $1 million, Japanese-built, electric trains are
in constant radio contact with the control room, but cars can be
stopped or slowed by remote control.
   A projected 5,000 to 7,000 riders a day are expected to board
the air-conditioned, rubber-wheeled coaches that will glide over
nearly seamless rails at speeds of up to 55 mph for a one-way fare
of $1.10.
   Ted Kalivas, 66, of Long Beach said he rode the Red Car line as
a teen-ager but said he would stay off the Blue Line.
   ``It's good transportation, but it goes through a bad area,''
Kalivas said in a coffee shop near the Anaheim Street station. ``I
would say it will be very dangerous. The cops had better be right
there.''

   Scattered rain pelted the nation from the eastern seaboard to
the Mississippi River early today, and heavy thunderstorms were
likely in the central Appalachians and Ohio Valley.
   Mostly dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Another hot day was expected today in the West, following a week
of scorching temperatures and heavy electrical use.
   Unseasonably cool and damp weather in the Northeast was likely
to subside and New England was likely to have warm, dry weather.
   Today's forecast called for sunny and dry weather from the Great
Lakes to the northern plains of Texas.
   Partly cloudy skies and some scattered rain were forecast for
the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians, and thunderstorms were
likely to unleash heavy rains in some areas, bringing a chance for
flooding.
   Thunderstorms were likely over the southern Rockies, with some
flash flooding possible in desert regions. Flooding also was
possible in the South.
   In Northern California temperatures climbed past 100 degrees in
many areas on Friday, and thunderstorms brought heavy rain showers
in the Sierras.
   Record electricity use was reported in the region.
   Red Bluff and Redding had highs of 111 degrees; it was 108 in
Fresno and Paso Robles; 107 in Sacramento; 106 in Stockton and 103
in Livermore.
   The nation's high on Friday was 112 degrees at Bullhead City,

   The Soviet prime minister, KGB chief and defense
minister were dropped today from a completely revamped Communist
Party Politburo, whose only holdovers are Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
his deputy.
   The move, announced after the 28th party congress that closed
Friday night, advanced the goal of President and party chief
Gorbachev of further separating the party from the government
apparatus.
   Vaulting into the Politburo, the party's leading body that was
doubled in size to 24 members, were the party leaders from the 15
Soviet republics as well as several moderate reformers and
officials little known outside their areas of specialty.
   The new Politburo, elected by the party's new Central Committee,
represented a sharp break with past practice in which the Politburo
was the locus of all power in the Soviet Union and its members also
held the senior positions in the government.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, KGB Chairman Vladimir A.
Kryuchkov and Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, as well as
Gorbachev adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev, Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and traditionalist Yegor K. Ligachev all were dropped
from the Politburo.
   All but Ligachev remain Central Committee members, however.
   ``The new composition of the Politburo underscores that the
party fully breaks with the former practice when it was organically
built into the command and administrative system, and was on the
top of the hierarchy,'' said Ivan Frolov, the editor of the party
newspaper Pravda and a new Politburo member.
   Frolov announced that in addition to the heads of party
organizations in the Soviet republics, himself, Gorbachev and
deputy party leader Vladimir A. Ivashko, the new Politburo will
include:
   _Yuri Prokofiev, the Moscow Communist Party chief. Prokofiev is
known as a moderate reformer.
   _Gennady Yanayev, who became head of the Central Council of
Trade Unions last year after labor unrest began spreading through
the country. He will be responsible for international affairs .
   _Galina Semyonova, editor-in-chief of ``Peasant Woman''
magazine. She will be responsible for women's issues.
   Gorbachev, who has engineered a shift of power to the presidency
at the cost of his party chief position, acknowledged that the
party's days of monolithic power were over.
   ``We're on the threshold of a multiparty system. I don't see
anything frightening in that,'' he told CBS News on Friday.
   Gorbachev was critical of prominent liberals who quit the party,
including maverick Boris Yeltsin _ the president of the vast
Russian republic _ and the mayors of Moscow and Leningrad _ the
nation's biggest cities.
   But he admitted that such defections point to a ``gap'' between
the people and the party.
   The congress was the stormiest Kremlin gathering since 1921,
when Bolshevik revolutionaries faced violent uprisings by workers
and sailors.
   At the congress, Gorbachev was victorious in removing such
hard-line critics as Ligachev from the policy-setting Central
Committee as well as from the Politburo.
   In yet another victory for the Soviet leader, delegates elected
a 412-member Central Committee that appeared to be packed with
moderate reformers of the Gorbachev mold.
   Under his guidance, the party last winter also relinquished its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power.
   Despite his successes, Gorbachev displayed some chagrin at the
defections of leading reformers. Yeltsin, elected in May as
president of Russia, told the congress Thursday he was quitting the
party.
   As president of the Russian republic, which has three-quarters
of the Soviet Union's territory and 52 percent of its people, he
must listen to all political parties and cannot obey only the
Communist Party, he said.
   The mayors of Moscow and Leningrad, Gavriil Popov and Anatoly
Sobchak, on Friday joined Yeltsin in quitting the party. They
issued a statement saying the congress itself ``showed the complete
inability of the party to offer the country a real program of
transition to a new society.''
   Members of the reformist Democratic Platform bloc said they
would hold a founding congress for a new non-communist party in
October. They predicted many in the party would follow them.
   Gorbachev told CBS he had ``contempt'' for those who left the
party, and told the congress those quitting had dealt ``a blow to
the entire cause of revolutionary renewal.''
   But he also told delegates the party was determined ``to bridge
the still-existing gap'' between the party and the people.
   Thousands of people have quit the party in recent months, and
the departure of the reform leaders and the rising anger of coal
miners and other workers appeared likely to accelerate that process.
   The nearly 4,700 delegates to the 28th party congress ended the
session by giving themselves a standing ovation and singing ``The
Internationale,'' the socialist anthem.

<TEXT>
   France celebrated Bastille Day with music, food,
fireworks and a display of military muscle ranging from World War
II-vintage tanks to state-of-the-art missiles.
   This year's festivities were scaled down from last year's
bicentennial blowout, when about 1 million visitors converged on
the French capital. Tourism officials said about half as many
people traveled to Paris for this year's celebrations.
   For those Parisians who were put out by traffic jams and miffed
by crowds in their favorite cafes last year, the smaller
festivities were a welcome change of pace.
   Bastille Day marks the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789,
generally regarded as the spark for the French Revolution, which
toppled Louis XVI and gave France its first republican government.
   Despite the climate of lessened military tensions in Europe,
France pulled out the stops for its traditional military parade.
   A week ago, Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement underlined
France's commitment to keep a strong conventional and nuclear
force, even as the Warsaw Pact and NATO are negotiating deep
defense cuts in the wake of the democratization of Eastern Europe.
   Thousands of soldiers marched down the Champs-Elysees to the
Place de la Concorde. Jets screamed overhead, sending blue, white
and red contrails to match a huge tricolor fluttering under the Arc
de Triomphe.
   About 600 tanks and other armored vehicles lined the route or
paraded along. The vehicles represent about 15 percent of France's
armored forces.
   Bearded companies of Foreign Legionnaires were fitted out in
desert khakis and their trademark white kepis. The
Napoleonic-uniformed Republican Guards, who provide the ceremonial
security at the presidential palace, trotted along on cavalry
horses, gleaming chrome sabers flashing.
   The French even rolled out their the new Mistral ground-to-air
missile, capable of reaching speeds of 1,864 mph.
   A platoon of World War II-era tanks, similar to those that
liberated Paris from the Nazi occupation 50 years ago, clanked by.
One bore the name ``De Gaulle,'' in tribute to Gen. Charles de
Gaulle, the wartime leader of the Free French. France is
celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth this year.
   A fireworks display was planned for tonight, and showman
Jean-Michel Jarre was giving an evening concert at the year-old
Grande Arche in the financial district of La Defense.
   The concert was expected to draw 2 million spectators. The
government spent $8.2 million underwriting the show so admission
could be free.

   Lois Moran Young, a star of silent films
who was known through much of her career as Lois Moran, died Friday
at age 81.
   She died at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home.
   The actress made more than two dozen movies, including
``Reckless Lady,'' ``The Road to Mandalay,'' ``Don't Marry,''
``Mammy'' and ``The Men in Her Life.''
   Mrs. Young made her first film at 14 and gained fame the
following year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel
Goldwyn's ``Stella Dallas.''
   She also sang for four years in the musical productions ``Of
Thee I Sing'' and ``Let 'em Eat Cake'' and co-starred with Robert
Preston in the television series ``Waterfront.''
   F. Scott Fitzgerald reportedly based the character Rosemary in
his novel ``Tender is the Night'' on Mrs. Young

<HEAD>Explosion At Hotel Kills Black Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black worker was killed
today in the bombing of a hotel frequented mostly by whites, police
said.
   Police said there also was an explosion this morning at the
suburban Johannesburg home of a reported right-wing white activist.
No one was injured, police said.
   Police spokesman Lt. Peter du Preez said commercial explosives
were used in the blast at the Will Smith Hotel in Florida, a suburb
of Johannesburg.
   No one claimed responsibility and there was no immediate
evidence the attack was politically motivated, police and the hotel
owners said.
   Right-wing whites have claimed responsibility for a recent spate
of bombings aimed at blacks and at whites who oppose apartheid, but
the latest attack did not appear to fit the pattern.
   Florida is a middle-class and working-class area and most of the
whites tend to be relatively conservative.
   The blast caused relatively minor damage, according to police
and hotel owners. The slain man was a waiter in the hotel bar.
   There were about 130 patrons at the bar at the time of the
blast, all of them white, said Rod Rodrigues, one of the owners.
   The other explosion was at the home of Hans Binneman, whom the
independent South African Press Association described as a member
of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement. It quoted police as
saying he recently was detained for questioning about bombings in
Johannesburg.
   Police say they suspect right-wing whites in the recent attacks
and nine have been detained for questioning, but no one has been
charged.
   Right-wing whites have vowed to resist President F.W. de Klerk's
plans to dismantle apartheid and share power with the 30 million
black majority.
   The African National Congress, the leading black opposition
group, supports a guerrilla campaign against the government, but
major attacks have ceased in recent months.

   The city Transit Authority is making a new push
to get rid of derelicts, drifters and displaced who use the
country's biggest subway system as a place to sleep.
   Beginning Sunday, police will force all passengers to get off
the A train when it arrives at the northern end of its 30-mile
route, which includes the entire length of Manhattan.
   Anyone who balks will be physically removed, officials said.
   The A-train trip takes about 1{ hours, making it especially
attractive to people who use the subways, which run 24 hours a day,
as a place to sleep.
   ``There's really no problem with sleeping on the trains but we
can't allow people to sprawl out and take up several seats,'' said
Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman.
   He said a worse problem is the behavior of some homeless people
when they are awakened at the final stop, a station where subway
cars are cleaned and made ready for the return trip.
   ``Some of them get pretty upset when the workers try to get them
to move. Some of our people have been hit, kicked and even spit
on,'' Lebow said.
   The new policy follows a crackdown in early June aimed at
removing hundreds of panhandlers and homeless people from the
subways and the city's two major rail terminals, Grand Central
Terminal and Penn Station.
   The new effort will be extended next month to another of the
city's subway routes, the E train.
   The Transit Authority said workers from outreach programs will
assist any homeless people who want to go to shelters.
   As with the earlier campaign to displace the displaced from
Grand Central and Penn stations, the latest move prompted a sharp
reaction from advocates for the homeless.
   ``When are they going to learn? Moving homeless people from one
area to another accomplishes nothing,'' said Mary Brosnahan,
director of the Coalition for the Homeless. ``When is somebody
going to stop playing the shell game and work on real solutions to
the problem?''

<HEAD>Irish Envoy Discusses Hostages With Syrian Intelligence Officer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish envoy Adrian McDaid met today with
a Syrian intelligence officer in an effort to gain some information
on the hoped-for release of Irish hostage Brian Keenan.
   McDaid, first secretary of the Irish Embassy in Baghdad, which
also oversees Irish affairs in Lebanon, was scheduled to meet later
with Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   The results of the meeting between McDaid and Syrian Brig. Ali
Hammoud were unclear. Hammoud is in charge of security in west
Beirut.
   A source at the Irish consulate, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said McDaid was ``trying to find out from Brigadier
Hammoud whether the Syrians had any information on the hostage
release.'' He refused to elaborate.
   The Irish diplomat flew to Lebanon Thursday in an effort to
verify a report by Iran's official news agency that a European
hostage held in Lebanon would be released soon.
   The report, issued by the Islamic Republic News Agency last
week, did not identify the hostage to be freed. But sources close
to the command of Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon said it would be
Keenan.
   McDaid visited the Iranian news agency's west Beirut office on
Friday to inquire about the agency's sources.
   IRNA's resident correspondent Mussayeb Naimi said: ``We stressed
that our sources are reliable and we explained to Mr. McDaid that
the hostage to be released will probably be a European national.''
   ``He asked us about the reports that said Keenan will be
released and we explained to him that our report did not name the
hostage,'' Naimi added.
   The 16 Western hostages held mainly by pro-Iranian underground
Shiite factions are Keenan, six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss and an Italian. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
   Keenan, an English language teacher from Belfast, was kidnapped
in west Beirut April 11, 1986, as he walked to the American
University of Beirut, where he worked.

   Artists are expressing themselves in a new way
with modern technology, but they've got to get their fax right.
   ``Artists love new toys, to experiment, to look for new visual
results,'' said Karen Indeck, co-curator of the University of
Illinois' Faxart exhibit. ``Visual art is about images, and it's an
incredible use of a new technology to create these images.''
   Co-sponsored by University of Illinois' School of Art and the
School of the Art Institute, Faxart features the work of their
alumni and other artists worldwide and is entirely composed of work
transmitted by fascimile machine.
   On July 2, a fax machine was activated at Gallery 400, an old
bra and girdle factory converted into a gallery.
   Ever since, the phone has been ringing with entries. Some
artists redialed more than five hours before getting through.
   Beyond its novelty, another appeal of fax art to artists is its
short-lived quality.
   Judith Kitzes, an Evanston-based artist, submitted a piece
consisting only of the words ``Learn to Live with Ambiguity.'' The
computer-generated sentence is repeated 108 times on 10 sheets of
paper.
   ``I like the idea that I wrote one sentence, repeated it, the
original in the computer does not exist, the original on paper I
destroyed after faxing it, and the work of art _ the fax _ will
fade,'' she said.
   ``It's a contradiction of what we expect art to be _ this
precious thing. It really isn't. That's something that appeals to
my sense of the bizarre: self-destructive art.''
   The transient, informal nature of the medium also appealed to
Indeck and co-curator Mary Min, who have been busily pinning and
taping landscapes, abstracts and portraits to the walls and columns
at Gallery 400.
   Since Indeck and Min plugged in a donated fax machine and loaded
the first roll of paper, about 900 artworks have been received.
   The show is the first major exhibit featuring only fax art, its
curators said.
   David Hockney's 144-sheet tennis match, faxed from California to
a gallery in Saltaire, England, in November, is one of the first
fax art pieces ever exhibited.
   So far, Indeck and Min have used 1,600 pushpins and countless
rolls of double-sided tape to hang about 300 works, some from as
far away as Spain and the Netherlands.
   The rest lie in piles on the floor.
   On Friday _ just hours before the exhibit was to open to the
public _ an uninterrupted stream of works still flowed from the fax
machine while an assistant sorted and filed the entries.
   Min said the challenge of creating images that would have an
impact even after being faxed _ and the speed by which those images
could be transmitted worldwide _ sparked her curiosity.
   ``You finish something, you send it out, and you get a response
_ it's an artist's dream,'' said Min, a Chicago-based neon artist.
   ``And when the show's over, poof! It's gone.''
   Images created on the thermal paper used in fax machines last
about six months _ less if they're exposed to sunlight or bright
artificial illumination.
   Fax art can be carefully preserved by de-acidifying the paper,
but not the works exhibited at Faxart.
   Min said the pieces will be recycled when the show closes Aug.
17.
   So when talk arose about whether to put the artwork up for sale,
it really was just in jest.
   Said Chicago artist Julie Richman: ``How would you sell this?
Would someone with a fax machine say, `I want to buy this,' and
then I would fax it?''

<TEXT>
   The first of more than 3,000
Albanian refugees arrived in West Germany by train today, joyously
waving their hands in victory as they savored their new freedom.
   About 125 Albanians reached southern Heidelberg aboard a special
West German train that left Basel, Switzerland, after a brief
stopover en route from Italy.
   ``There was no way to live,'' Avni Azizi, a 23-year-old Albanian
tailor said of his hard-line Communist homeland. ``We all think
that, at the most, in one year the whole Albanian people will be
free.''
   The refugees began crowding into foreign embassies in Tirana two
weeks ago, seeking to flee Albania, which has resisted the kinds of
sweeping democratic reforms that radically altered other East
European countries since last fall.
   About 4,500 Albanians were evacuated in a sealift across the
Adriatic Sea to Brindisi, Italy, early Friday.
   Today, 56 refugees sheltered in the Polish Embassy in the
Albanian capital reached Warsaw by plane and were taken to an army
facility northwest of the city.
   Another 39 Albanian refugees, including six women and two
children, arrived in Budapest, Hungary, by plane and were sent to a
refugee camp in the Buda hills, near the capital, according to news
reports.
   On the same plane were five Albanians who took refuge at the
Bulgarian Embassy. They departed Budapest for the Bulgarian capital
of Sofia, Budapest radio said.
   Most of the refugees were reported to want to emigrate to
Western Europe or the United States where they have relatives and
friends, the radio said.
   The French Foreign Ministry announced in a communique that the
ferry Orient Star, carrying 544 Albanians, will dock at Marseille
on Sunday.
   A special train will transport 514 to reception centers near
Reims and they will then be bused to reception centers in
Mourmelon, Creil and Emance. The remaining 30 will be taken to
centers at Perigueux and St. Astier in the Dordogne region of
southwestern France.
   The ship had been scheduled to arrive in Marseille today, but
fell behind schedule when a pregnant woman, Dirianda Daja, 21,
became ill and had to be evacuated to Italy, Agence-France Presse
said.
   Four ships chartered by the West German, Italian and French
governments had picked up the 4,500 Albanians in the Albaninan port
of Durres early Friday under an agreement worked out with United
Nations mediation.
   Before Albanian authorities sealed off the embassy compounds,
asylum-seekers scrambled up embassy walls and pushed their way
through gates, sometimes braving police gunfire.
   The Albanian government agreed to let the refugees leave the
country after supplies of food and medicine in the embassies ran
low and hygienic conditions deteriorated.
   Three West German trains were sent to Italy to collect the 3,200
Albanians who sought refuge in the West German Embassy in Tirana.
In Basel, they boarded smaller trains taking them to 14 towns in
West Germany.
   Those arriving in Heidelberg, 60 miles south of Frankfurt, were
the first to reach their destination.
   They arrived tired after a seven-hour boat journey to Brindisi
and 26-hour train ride to West Germany, but they said they were
elated by the prospect of a new life.
   Enkeo Halili, a 24-year-old mechanic, said: ``We are leaving our
country because we don't want these Communists. We are young ... we
are poor. We've never even seen a discotheque.''
   The German Red Cross said 10 of the 125 refugees were sick and
would be taken to hospitals. Carl Bauer, a Red Cross spokesman in
Bonn, said they were suffering from fever, diarrhea and weakness.
   Other Albanians were taken to a former clinic in Heidelberg that
until recently housed East German refugees.
   A defection of tens of thousands of East Germans last fall
fueled the downfall of that nation's hard-line Communist government.
   The Albanian government introduced limited reforms last year,
including some religious freedom and travel abroad, which Albanians
were not permitted for 45 years.
   On Friday, about 100,000 people rallied in the Albanian capital
of Tirana in support of the Communist leadership, the state ATA
news agency reported.
   The rally was organized in Skanderbeg Square, close to the
diplomatic community where the refugees began seeking asylum on
June 28.
   Xhelil Gjoni, a member of the party's policy-making Politburo,
told the rally that ``Albania and its people's power are unshaken
by degenerate people who abandon their homeland or by anyone
else,'' said a Tirana Radio broadcast, monitored in London.

   A young American, the first woman known
to be injured in the running of the bulls, suffered a fractured
skull today on the final day of the weeklong San Fermin festival, a
hospital spokesman said.
   Stephanie Kern, 21, was being treated at the emergency room of
Navarre Hospital after she was knocked down by a bull during the
run at the festival made famous by author Ernest Hemingway, the
spokesman said.
   He said Ms. Kern, of Myrtle Beach, S.C., was in serious
condition.
   ``She wanted to do it so badly. I support her in what she wants
to do, which might have been a mistake this time,'' said the
injured woman's mother, Hannah Kern of Clinchport, Va. ``Everybody
told me how safe it was.''
   Ms. Kern, who will be a senior at Coastal College in Conway,
S.C., and her mother arrived in Pamplona July 11.
   She is the first woman known to have been injured in the running
of the bulls, officials said.
   Although women now are allowed to participate, few are ever seen
among the dozens of mostly young men who test their bravery by
running ahead of or alongside the bulls, which are later killed at
evening bullfights.
   Mrs. Kern said her daughter had been racing ahead of the six
bulls in a pack of people when the group suddenly surged forward.
When she looked ahead to check her footing, a bull butted her with
his head, and caught her torso inside his horns.
   The force of the impact sent her sprawling head first to the
cobblestone street, Mrs. Kern said.
   Five other people were treated at area hospitals after being
less seriously injured during the 2{-minute run with the bulls
along the half-mile route from the corrals to the city bullring.
   The daily runs are the highlight of the weeklong festival, which
was the setting for Hemingway's novel ``The Sun Also Rises'' and
attracts thousands of tourists from around the world.
   According to city records, bulls have gored to death 52 people
during the festival, which has been held continuously since 1591.

   The Soviet foreign minister and the head of NATO
began talks today on how to resolve military and political problems
related to German unification, the official Tass news agency said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Manfred Woerner,
secretary general of the Western military alliance, were also
expected to discuss the NATO summit held in London earlier this
month.
   At the summit, alliance leaders agreed on a new strategy and
proposed a non-aggression declaration to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Woerner was to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the
Kremlin where he is likely to extend the official invitation for
the Soviet leader to visit the Brussels headquarters of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Woerner, who was West German Defense Minister from 1982-88 in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, is also likely to outline the
implications of German unification during meetings with Soviet
officials.
   The Kremlin, which still has an estimated 380,000 troops in
former Communist East Germany, so far has declined to agree to a
united Germany's membership in NATO.
   The questions of Germany's military and political obligations
are being worked out in the framework of ``two-plus-four'' talks
between the two Germanies and four World War II allies _ the United
States, France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union.
   Sessions of those talks have already been held in Bonn and East
Berlin and a further round is expected in Moscow early this fall.

<HEAD>Two Cuban Refugees Leave Czechoslovak Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the 14 Cubans who sought
refuge in Czechoslovakia's embassy in Havana earlier this week have
left the mission, the Foreign Ministry said today.
   According to a report carried by the state CTK news agency, one
refugee left without notifying the embassy and the other asked to
be released. The two apparently left without explanation.
   ``They left Friday afternoon, sometime between 4 and 4:30 p.m.
local time,'' said Marcel Cintalan, a Foreign Ministry official.
``We don`t know why. They did not give any reasons.''
   A senior official said Friday that Czechoslovakia would not turn
the Cuban refugees in the Havana embassy over to authorities and
that Prague was prepared for long and complicated talks over their
fate.
   Three other asylum-seekers have sought refuge in Spain's Havana
embassy.
   The Czechoslovak deputy foreign minister, Lubos Dobrovsky, met
with Cuban Ambassador Mario Rodriguez Martinez Friday and asked
Cuba to grant the refugees free passage.
   Dobrovsky also met with senior Soviet, West German and Italian
diplomats to seek their help in resolving the situation.
   Tension has been growing between the two former Communist allies
since a democratic revolution swept Czechoslovakia's Communist
rulers from power last winter.
   Earlier this week, Prague said it suspected the influx of Cuban
refugees might be a deliberate provocation by Havana to underline
the growing strain between the nations.

<TEXT>
   A businessman has dropped plans to kill
30,000 South African seals, following protests by international
animal rights activists, a government official said Saturday.
   The businessman, Hsu Hsien-i, had received approval from South
Africa to kill 25,000 seal cubs for processing as dog food. He was
also to cull 5,000 adult male seals, whose genitals are prized as
aphrodisiacs in the Far East.
   But after protests, South Africa this month temporarily
suspended plans for the seal kill. Hsu has since decided to abandon
the project, acccording to Foreign Ministry spokesman, Huang
Hsin-pi.
   He said the Foreign Ministry recently asked Hsu to reconsider
plans to kill the seal cubs because of the international outcry.
Some protesters had threatened to boycott Taiwanese products.
   Many countries have outlawed the killing of seals.
   South Africa initially defended the seal culling project, saying
the country's 1.2 million seals ate huge quanties of fish and could
damage the fishing industry.

<HEAD>Experts Say Barry Behavior Fits Pattern of Substance Abuser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On Dec. 22, 1988, Mayor Marion Barry rushed
his aides through a session on the city budget and then left
hurriedly, saying he needed to attend a funeral.
   But according to testimony in Barry's drug and perjury trial,
the mayor first drove that day to the hotel room of an
acquaintance, drug dealer Charles Lewis. Lewis has said in court
that Barry presented him with a crack cocaine pipe and the two men
tested it.
   The events of that afternoon provide a glimpse into the life of
a man whose official duties included grappling publicly with the
difficulties of a large urban city, while _ according to numerous
witnesses at the trial _ routinely using illegal drugs in private.
   Medical experts say juggling such activities would be difficult,
but not impossible, and that substance abusers can hide their
problems from close associates.
   But they pay a price.
   ``The bottom line is that in policy-making jobs, when you talk
about alcohol and drugs, there's no question that they will have an
effect on job performance,'' said Dr. Michael Stoil of the
Washington-area chapter of Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse.
``Normally, you see the effect mostly with attention span and
concentration.''
   ``Studies of alcoholism, in particular, generally suggest that
work is the last thing to go,'' said Dr. Marc Hertzman, a George
Washington University psychiatry professor who studies the effects
of substance abuse.
   ``When all else _ marriage, family life _ is gone, most people
can still carry on effectively enough so that their associates and
superiors do not suspect a problem,'' Hertzman said in an interview
last week.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to all charges, although he has
admitted using cocaine in what he says was an FBI entrapment when
he was arrested last Jan. 18 during a sting operation at a
Washington hotel.
   So far in the trial, which resumes Tuesday, eight prosecution
witnesses have testified that they saw Barry use drugs, including
cocaine, crack cocaine, marijuana and opium, with the first such
allegation dating to 1985. One witness, Rasheeda Moore, testified
that she and the mayor used drugs more than 100 times together.
   Following his arrest, Barry spent seven weeks in Florida and
South Carolina substance abuse treatment programs. He has said he
was treated for addictions to alcohol and two prescription
medicines.
   The experts' experience that a substance abuser can continue to
work, even though impaired, conforms with the recollections of
Barry's top advisers.
   ``He seemed very distracted, unfocused,'' said one top Barry
aide in recalling the December 1988 meeting on the city budget.
   ``He was in a real hurry to leave, and here we were talking
about the possibility of a budget deficit. He did not give his full
time and attention to the meeting,'' the aide said.
   Even before that day in 1988, the mayor's own aides had begun a
quiet surveillance of their own, keeping track of how many morning
meetings Barry missed and whether he was paying attention in the
ones he did attend.
   ``Something was wrong,'' one aide said. ``He had always been so
sharp, but he just wasn't anymore.''
   ``It was like with families of alcoholics,'' said another top
aide. ``We'd meet with him, come out and ask each other, `Well, how
did he look today?'
   The aides spoke only on condition that their names not be used.
   By the fall of 1989 many of Barry's top assistants had concluded
privately that the mayor had a substance abuse problem.
   They recall being startled in November 1989 when Barry used a
city cabinet meeting to give a speech on the dangers of drug abuse
and then introduce seven recovering addicts who discussed their
problems.
   ``At the end of the meeting, in front of all 50 of us, the mayor
asked one of them what cocaine felt like,'' said one cabinet member
who was there.
   And at the next month's cabinet meeting _ less than a month
before his arrest in the sting operation _ Barry invited two
doctors to address the group on the medical effects of drug abuse.
   ``It was almost like he was going through a cathartic
experience, crying out for help, and dragging us along,'' said
another cabinet member, who also spoke only on condition of
anonymity. ``Many of us were ignorant about drugs, and the mayor
certainly cast himself in that camp.''
   One drug counselor says Barry's behavior fits a well-known
pattern.
   ``Generally speaking, that is part of the manipulation that goes
on in a person's mind to deny the use _ to cover their tracks with
other people,'' says Jill Wiedemann-West, a drug counselor with
Hazelden Services Inc.
   ``Part of (the) denial is to make people believe you are not in
any way, shape or form involved in drugs.''

   Flooding and mudslides caused by three days of
heavy rains killed 21 people and left 31 missing in two provinces,
the official China Daily newspaper said Saturday.
   Floodwaters inundated Beixu village in northern Shanxi province,
leaving at least 14 people dead and five missing, the paper said.
   Seven people were killed and 26 missing in mudslides in
Liangshan prefecture, southwestern Sichuan province, it said.
   Heavy rain and hail began pounding Shanxi at midnight Wednesday,
and nearly 3 inches of rain fell in less than an hour, the report
said.
   Protective dams around Beixu village collapsed, allowing
floodwaters to rush through. Many villages in Shanxi are located in
deep gullies caused by centuries of erosion, and are prone to
flooding.

<HEAD>Democracy Has Not Solved All Eastern Europe's Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of East Europeans expected the
tide of democracy that swept the Communists from power last year to
solve all their problems. It hasn't, and discontent is spreading.
   Janos Lampert, a 32-year-old electrician in Budapest, Hungary,
was an avid supporter of the democracy movement.
   Three months after democratic elections gave Hungary its first
non-Communist government in four decades, he still moonlights to
support his wife and two children.
   Laid up after an accident, Lampert watched democracy at work _
live televised Parliament sessions.
   ``Disgusting,'' he said. ``I just can't see those guys, yakking
all day while the economy is in shambles.''
   Problems in Budapest may differ from those in Bucharest, East
Berlin, Prague, Sofia or Warsaw, but disappointment is widespread.
   Some East Europeans question whether the battle for democracy
has really been won. Others are depressed by the long road to
prosperity that lies ahead.
   Hungarians have been subjected to price increases, new taxes and
business bankruptcies that produced unemployment. The mood is
sullen. Many believe the new government of political neophytes is
unequal to the task of improving conditions with a minimum of pain.
   For Hungarians thinking of starting a business, government
permission takes up to three months.
   Inflation exceeded 30 percent in the first quarter, industrial
production dropped more than 8 percent and an estimated 50,000
people were unemployed, compared with 3,200 a year ago. The foreign
debt of $20.6 billion is the highest per capita in Eastern Europe.
   Decades of Communist mismanagement in Romania left many
industries and services barely functioning, but there is enough to
eat for the first time in a decade.
   In a country unused to even a trace of freedom, the meeting of
basic needs appears to be reason for economic contentment. The
political situation is less promising.
   Multiparty elections held May 20 were generally fair, but were
preceded by campaign violence unequalled in the region. Many
Romanians still fear and distrust the victorious National Salvation
Front, whose leaders they consider Commmunist.
   The government's inauguration last month was preceded by violent
attacks on government institutions and mob rule by miners answering
a government appeal for help.
   ``After such a bloody riot, it is very easy to bring people back
onto the streets,'' Adrian Severin, who is charged with introducing
a market economy, said afterward. ``The hate in the people's soul
was not at all consumed.''
   Political turmoil also contributes to a sense of insecurity in
Bulgaria, the only East European country where the ruling
Communists won democratic elections.
   Threats of escalating strikes forced the resignation July 7 of
President Petar Mladenov, a reform Communist, and protests continue
by activists seeking a full reckoning with the past.
   Concern that a government hamstrung by protest would not be able
to deal with pressing economic problems added to the pessimism in
Bulgaria.
   It has had to suspend payments of all but interest on the $10
billion debt. An estimated 60 percent of industry is unprofitable
and unemployment is growing.
   Nowhere does the connection between economic and political
problems seem so clear as in Poland, where the Solidarity-led
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki won partially free
elections more than a year ago.
   Stores are relatively well stocked and people appear to be
managing, but workers have gone on strike over rising prices and
wage controls.
   Mazowiecki's critics want to replace President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the former Communist leader, with Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa. They say the people are less willing to make economic
sacrifices when the president and many members of Parliament are
Communist holdovers.
   In a speech to workers July 8, Walesa said: ``We were not
prepared for ... the work that would come after the abolition of
communism.''
   Even Czechoslovaks, left with a relatively healthy economy, are
having trouble with economic adjustments. Food prices were
increased 25 percent on July 11.
   Rents and energy costs are scheduled to rise in the fall,
followed by total price decontrol and accelerated conversion to
private enterprise early next year.
   ``I don't know what I'll do if things go on like this,'' said
pensioner Libuse Klementova.
   East Germans are assured of relatively quick prosperty through
union with West Germany, but are bracing for short-term turmoil.
   One-third to more than one-half the country's 8,000 major
enterprises are expected to go broke in a few months. Millions of
people could lose their jobs and many people have predicted a ``hot
autumn'' of strikes.
   With West Germany financing economic reform, officials say the
situation will begin to improve next year.

<HEAD>Rebels to Negotiate Release of Two Kidnapped Aid Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels have agreed to
negotiate the release of a kidnapped U.S. Peace Corps volunteer and
a Japanese aid worker, a retired Roman Catholic bishop said.
   Members of a committee met today to discuss terms laid down by
the rebels here on Negros island, 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   Retired Bishop Antonio Fortich said the offer and conditions for
the release of Timothy Swanson and Fumio Mizuno were contained in a
letter from Celso Magsilang, spokesman for the New People's Army on
Negros.
   Rebels kidnapped Mizuno, 36, an official of the Organization for
Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement, on May 29 and
Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., on June 13.
   Fortich said the letter was the first rebel confirmation they
were holding the two.
   ``They said they are willing to surrender both of them, either
separately or together,'' Fortich said.
   Fortich said rebel conditions included a three-day truce with
the military. He said they also want soldiers excluded from the
negotiating committee, and a representative of the International
Red Cross, two doctors, the Filipino wives of the two captives, and
members of the news media included in the talks. Fortich is also a
member of the committee.
   Last month, the United States suspended its 21-year-old Peace
Corps program in the Philippines and sent all volunteers home
because of alleged rebel threats against staffers.

   Ronald Rohde says every day since last July 19 is a gift.
   ``By all rights, I should have been dead almost a year ago,''
says the 40-year-old veterinarian from Marysville, Ohio. ``It's
easier to find the silver lining in the clouds now. Life's
irritations are a little easier to shrug off. What's there to get
worked up about when you could be upside down in a burning airplane?
   ``Every time the sun comes up, I think how lucky I am to be able
to see it,'' says Rohde.
   Now, when he flies, ``I look at the stewardesses and I look at
the pilots and I wonder if it came crunch time if they would
perform as well as the captain and flight crew on Flight 232.''
   His two children worry, saying: ``You're not flying on a DC-10?
Your plane better not crash.' I say, `They usually don't.' ''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Clifton Marshall, 45, of Ostrander, Ohio, works with Rohde and
was with him on Flight 232. In the last moments before the crash,
he wrote a goodbye letter to his family. Today he has no angry
words, no hostile feelings.
   ``There are people who think all of the risks should be covered.
They're more inclined to think that the world should be risk free.
That ain't the way that it is. ... I take bigger risks everyday
riding my bicycle to work,'' says Marshall.

   Bruce Benham believes that walking away from Flight 232 was the
second of two deliverances he's had in life. The first was his
recovery from thyroid cancer in 1985.
   Now, after the crash, he's found a new appreciation for life.
   ``The first time I went skiing last winter the mountains and the
snow seemed more beautiful. There is a certain exhilaration in
surviving,'' the 38-year-old Denver restaurant executive says.
   ``I've become very health and safety conscious because the crash
heightened my concern about not being here forever. I've lost 25
pounds in the last six months and I worked at it.''

   William Robertson has composed a list of accomplishments and
things he still wants to do in life. He already has checked off one
item on his wish list: hot-air ballooning.
   The 48-year-old Amoco executive from Wheaton, Ill., has set a
goal of visiting 20 to 25 foreign counties in the next 10 years and
has shifted his priorities.
   ``I give more time to my family and friends and people I care
about. In many cases, I'm more selfish with whom I choose to spend

   Upton Rehnberg's frequent pains in his right hip are a physical
reminder.
   There are emotional ones, too.
   ``I was (recently) talking to somebody about the crash, all of a
sudden I was crying. ... It suddenly brought back a lot of the
emotions that I felt.''
   Rehnberg, who works for Sundstrand Corp., a manufacturer of
aircraft components, suffered facial and arm burns when a fireball
swept into the plane. He didn't return to his job until December,
and hasn't been back on a DC-10.
   ``I'm working at becoming less of a workaholic. I'm spending a
lot more time outdoors.''
   Rehnberg, who lives in Rockford, Ill., also is struggling with
another personal change _ divorce, which, he says, his wife partly
attributes to consequences of the crash.
   The last year has been one of ``incredible turmoil, both
externally and internally. ... This is just the beginning of a
cycle of many, many changes. My life is never going to be the
same.''

   Jerry Schemmel has stayed in touch with the family of 1-year-old
Sabrina Michaelson, the girl he ran back inside the burning plane
to save.
   Sabrina, of West Chester, Ohio, had been thrown through the air
and separated from her mother, father and two brothers. Her cries
caught Schemmel's ear as he fled.
   ``I was tested a little bit, so that has made me feel better. If
I'd heard the crying and not gone back into the plane I would have
had terrible guilt feelings. But you'd be surprised how many people
would have done what I did,'' says Schemmel, 30, of Denver.
   In the past year, Lori Michaelson, 36, has turned from survivor
to crusader _ lobbying for mandatory infant seats on planes.
   ``I'm trying just to go on. ... Instead of going overboard and
spoiling your kids, you try not to overcompensate in your life. ...
   ``You try to consciously focus on each day and realize how out
of control your life is ... how rapidly things can change. You
think you're creating your own destiny in your life and you're
not,'' the mother of three says.
   Major disasters rehash all the hurt, she says. And even normal
child's play can cause problems.
   ``The oddest things come out,'' she says. A child brought over a
cap gun once and her son, Andrew, ``got really upset. He didn't
want him to use it. It smelled like a burning airplane.''
   And 23-month-old Sabrina?
   ``She's learned to talk ... and started walking. She has been
running ever since.''

<TEXT>
   An English vicar is hitting back at the junk mail
industry with offers of ``your very own timeshare room in the
Mansion of Heaven.''
   Rev. Robin Charles of the Church of the Holy Spirit in Etching
Hill, northwest England, has been sending out a riposte to the
worst offenders, telling them they ``have been exclusively
selected'' to help repair his church.
   ``We would like to offer you a unique opportunity, only repeated
once a week, to join our heavenly timeshare scheme. To take
advantage of this exclusive offer just send a small donation for
our building fund,'' it says.
   ``In return, you are assured your very own timeshare room in the
Mansion of Heaven and if you reply within seven days we will send
you _ totally free _ a personally designed blessing of your own
choice.
   ``Just imagine, your very own blessing complete with one
guaranteed place in salvation!''
   The text of the offer appeared in Saturday's Daily Telegraph and
was confirmed by Charles' wife, Thelma.
   The Telegraph quoted the vicar as saying he wanted the junk
mailers ``to have a laugh and maybe dip into their pockets and send
us a donation. We need 75,000 pounds ($135,000) to repair the
church.''
   He has sent two dozen letters, and received a single donation of
$45.
   Charles was quoted as saying his annual intake of junk mail
``must be equal to about three Brazilian trees. Now the companies
know what it's like to get some of it back.
   ``But I reckon that if one piece of paper stops them sending me
20 pieces then I've won.''

<HEAD>Key Senators Urging Bush to Revamp Policy on Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Influential senators are joining an effort to
persuade President Bush to revamp U.S. policy toward Cambodia,
saying the current one could return the dreaded Khmer Rouge to
power.
   In the draft of a letter to Bush, the group says ``the Khmer
Rouge represents an unacceptable threat to the people of Cambodia,
and that American policy should be based, first and foremost, upon
preventing the return of the Khmer Rouge.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and a
bipartisan group of 10 other senators suggest in the letter that
Bush should open the door to contacts between the United States and
the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government of Hun Sen.
   They also ask Bush to implement a congressionally authorized aid
program for children who are victims of the country's civil war and
loosen restrictions on U.S. development and humanitarian aid to
Cambodia.
   The letter, circulated for signatures last week, is the latest
sign of growing congressional opposition to a decade-old policy
which sends U.S. aid to a loose political coalition fighting the
Hun Sen government.
   It has become increasingly clear that the Khmer Rouge, whose
regime was responsible for the deaths of more than a million
Cambodians in the 1970s, could be indirectly riding the U.S.
support back into power as the dominant member of the coalition.
   While the Bush administration insists that none of the U.S. aid
is helping the communist rebel group, there is increasing
restiveness on Capitol Hill. Last month the Senate Intelligence
Committee voted to kill a covert aid program for the resistance,
reportedly worth $10 million.
   The United States also has a $7 million program of overt,
non-lethal aid to the resistance coalition.
   Those pressing for the policy change included Intelligence
Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., vice chairman William
Cohen, R-Maine, and committee member John Danforth, R-Mo.;
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and
senior committee Republican Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
   Also included were Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and committee members Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; as well as Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., a past strong supporter of administration policy; and Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
   The administration and its congressional supporters say the aid
is important to keep alive an alternative political force that
could vie for power if negotiations succeeded in bringing about
elections. But the critics are not buying that.
   ``The president's policy in Cambodia is indefensible,'' Mitchell
told reporters last week. ``It doesn't make any sense. How can we,
the United States, which has already enacted into law a prohibition
on aiding the Khmer Rouge, engage in a policy which does precisely
that?''
   He expressed hope that the letter from Capitol Hill would help
strengthen those within the administration who are embarrassed
about the U.S. stance.
   Mitchell and others, including Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., have
suggested that with Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia last year,
the Khmer Rouge now represents a far greater threat.
   They believe U.S. Cambodia policy is a symptom of a larger Bush
blind spot when it comes to China _ the Khmer Rouge's chief
sponsor. ``It all goes back to China, the administration doesn't
want to offend China,'' Mitchell said.
   ``We believe that American policy can and should more clearly
and effectively help prevent future Khmer Rouge domination of
Cambodia,'' stated the letter.
   The group asks that Bush ``clearly state that the United States
will not support a negotiated solution that would give the Khmer
Rouge a role in Cambodia's future or increase the likelihood of a
Khmer Rouge military victory.''
   And noting a promise by Hun Sen to hold U.N.-supervised
elections, it expresses the ``hope that you will see value in
opening up direct contacts with representatives of the regime in
Phnom Penh.''
   It also asks for a more thorough investigation into reports of
military coordination between the non-communist resistance forces,
including the U.S.-backed faction led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
and the Khmer Rouge.
   And it asks for an end to U.S. support for any participation by
the Khmer Rouge in Cambodian representation at the United Nations.
``Better an empty seat than one which bestows international
legitimacy'' upon the forces of the infamous Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, the letter contends.

<HEAD>GOP Leaders Use Midyear Meeting To Launch Fall Offensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican leaders trying to get the party back
on sure footing after a stretch of rocky road are setting out on a
trusted course _ attack.
   It has been a tumultuous year for the GOP, beginning with a
divisive debate over abortion in January and then the news in March
that party Chairman Lee Atwater had a brain tumor. He has been
sidelined ever since.
   More recently, Republicans have been on the defensive as
Democrats try to blame them for the savings and loan crisis and GOP
candidates try to cope with President Bush's abrupt abandonment of
his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.
   But at a three-day meeting in Chicago that ended Saturday, the
Republican National Committee resolved to go back on the offensive.
   ``Controlling the agenda is the way to continue winning,'' said
Mary Matalin, Atwater's top deputy at the RNC. ``We somehow allowed
ourselves to fall off of offense, but the message is clear now.''
   A chorus of GOP leaders used both public and private sessions
during the GOP's midyear meeting to urge Republicans at both the
state and national level to be more aggressive.
   ``The obituaries are premature,'' Ed Rollins, head of the
party's House campaign arm, told the group in a speech laced with
blistering attacks on Democrats.
   From a lesser-known Republican, Mayor Sue Myrick of Charlotte,
N.C., came a demand that Republicans at all levels stop trying to
look and sound like Democrats.
   ``Far too many Republicans are not drifting but rather diving
headlong into softened stands on such issues as abortion, flag
burning and more taxes rather than more prudent spending,'' Myrick
said at one session. ``It is time to stand up, to be counted, to
fight.''
   The new effort relies heavily on the core strategies of past GOP
success: frame the debate on major issues and paint Democrats as
the party that taxes as a first resort.
   Bush pollster Bob Teeter told the gathering that if Republicans
articulate their party's differences with Democrats then voters
will ``side with the party that taxes last and taxes least, not the
party that taxes first and taxes most.''
   But Bush's reversal on taxes has many GOP officials wondering
whether the president has ditched the Republican Party's defining
issue just four months before the 1990 elections.
   Top party leaders and strategists told GOP officials from across
the country that Republicans cannot drop the tax issue, Bush's
announcement notwithstanding. And they promised that Bush will
protect the party's interests by fighting any attempts to raise
income taxes.
   Matalin believes the message took hold.
   ``We got done here what we had to do,'' she said in an
interview. ``This was the perfect forum for us to remind ourselves
that we do best when he define the differences between Republicans
and Democrats.''
   That such a lesson was necessary appears directly attributable
to the absence of Atwater.
   The energetic, raspy-voiced chairman had become the party's
singular spokesman, relied on by the White House and reporters
alike.
   Without him, a party renowned for speaking with one voice
suddenly had many, and the message got muddied.
   ``It has been a little fuzzy and it certainly has been distorted
by Democrats,'' Matalin said.
   ``We've hit a few bumps but we're ready to get back on track,''
said Haley Barbour, a leading GOP strategist and RNC member from
Mississippi.
   Still, even if the GOP can launch a unified offensive, the
party's challenge this fall is daunting.
   The decline of communism has stripped Republicans of one core
issue, and Bush's switch on taxes at a minimum makes it tougher for
the GOP to get an edge on that front. In addition, the party
controlling the White House traditionally loses seats in midterm
elections.
   At the same time, the Democratic Party appears to be having
success in articulating a unified message of its own _ a populist
pitch blaming Republican greed for the S&amp;L crisis.
   Not surprisingly, Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown said the
GOP's decision to mount an offensive was made out of fear.
   ``They don't want to talk about George Bush breaking his `read
my lips' pledge and what kind of S&amp;L bailout he is planning,''
Brown said. ``They don't want to talk about America's no-growth
economy so, of course, they'll come up with wild charges and finger
pointing.''
   But Matalin and other GOP leaders left the meeting satisfied
that better days lie ahead.
   ``This is not brain surgery,'' Matalin said. ``This is Campaign
101. We're not going to sit there and let them define the debate.''

her family's fondest memories:

   Edward M. Kennedy, 58, U.S. Senator:
   ``I was the last one. She was able to spend more time with me. I
remember when they came back from London in the middle of the
spring and they weren't sure what to do with me. So we went down to
the Cape, just Mother and I, and she tutored me herself. ... She's
the product of another era. I still tease her about it. Last night
she was talking about going to Palm Beach and she was saying,
`Isn't it time to start packing the trunks for Florida, Teddy?' I

   ``I remember once I was out walking with my grandmother. I was
19. She asked me about my girlfriend I had at the time, if I'd
kissed her. I said, yeah, I've kissed her a few times. Then she
said my grandfather was the only man she ever kissed. To me, that
totally defined her. Like, I kissed one man and he was a hell of a

she was too busy. And she always had a regular routine. You always
knew at 4:45, there'd be a walk.''

either learned something, a story about my mother, or I learned
something about me.''

   Older people are more avid newspaper readers
than young people, but the young are more apt to be reading books,
according to a study released Sunday.
   Those who get their news from newspapers appear to be better
informed than those who rely on radio, but not necessarily better
informed than television news watchers. And people with children
are more likely to watch the Sunday morning news interview shows on
television than people without.
   These tidbits are from a new study by the Times Mirror Center
for the People and the Press called ``The American Media: Who
Reads, Who Watches, Who Listens, Who Cares.''
   The study divides people into four groups based on the interest
they show in the news.
   Twelve percent are news sophisticates who form the regular
audience of National Public Radio, public television's
``MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour'' and such magazines as the Atlantic,
Harpers and the New Yorker.
   Eight percent do not read a daily newspaper or watch or listen
to the news regularly.
   Another 39 percent don't quite make news sophisticate but
nevertheless read a news magazine or a major metropolitan daily
newspaper or watch Sunday morning interview shows or Cable News
Network. They are called serious news consumers.
   The remaining 41 percent, the largest group, are moderate
consumers who regularly read a daily paper or watch or listen to
the news.
   Forty-one percent of the non-news users and 16 percent of the
news sophisticates are in the 18-29 age bracket.
   The analysis was based on 4,890 telephone interviews conducted
in the first four months of this year. The margin of error was plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
   The survey shows that 24 percent in 18-29 bracket said they had
read a daily newspaper the previous day. This rose to 61 percent
for persons over 80. The percentage increased steadily with age,
except for a slight slump among people in their 70s.
   Forty-three percent of people under 30, one of every two people
in their 30s and 40s and 44 percent of people 50 and over said they
listened to news on the radio regularly.
   For television, the percentages were 63 percent under 30, 71
percent in the 30s and 40s and 84 percent at age 50 and over.
   Five percent of childless people said they watched the Sunday
interview programs regularly. This rose to 11 percent for married
couples with children and 12 percent for single parents.
   Thirty-eight percent of people 18 to 29 said they were reading a
novel or other book. This increased to 39 percent among people in
their 30s and 41 percent for readers in their 40s.
   After that it dropped off to 35 percent for the 50s and 70s, 31
percent for the 60s and 29 percent for people over 80.
   The habit of watching CNN regularly rose from 21 percent in the
youngest age bracket to 28 percent for people in their 50s and 60s.
It dropped to 22 percent for viewers over 70.
   Among people who had spent one hour or more reading a daily
newspaper on the previous day, 20 percent correctly identified
Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, compared with 16 percent
for those who spent an hour or more watching television news and 11
percent for those who spent that much time listening to news on the
radio.
   In the same survey, 90 percent of the newspaper readers, 92
percent of the television watchers and 82 percent of the radio
listeners knew where Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took
refuge.
   Forty-seven percent of readers, 50 percent of watchers and 34
percent of listeners knew how the control of the Panama Canal will
change.

   The United States had warning prior
to the 1986 bombing of a West Berlin discotheque that Libya planned
a terrorist attack, a news magazine reported today.
   Der Spiegel, West Germany's leading news magazine, said the U.S.
government learned that Libya was planning an attack after at least
one CIA agent infiltrated the group that prepared the bombing.
   The blast on April 5, 1986, killed two American soldiers and a
Turkish woman and injured more than 200 people in West Berlin's La
Belle discotheque, which had been popular with U.S. servicemen.
   There were also reports shortly after the blast that the U.S.
knew an attack was imminent and that planning for the attack was
traced to the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin.
   The U.S. retaliated by bombing the Libyan cities of Benghazi and
Tripoli and the heavily guarded compound of Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi.
   Spiegel's story's appeared to be the first report involving a
CIA informer. The flow of information from the informer stopped
several days before the La Belle bombing, possibly explaining why
the attack on the discotheque was not prevented, the magazine said.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bonn refused to comment on the magazine's
report.
   The magazine said it based its report on documents from the
former East German Ministry for State Security and former East
German agents. It also said the documents showed how closely the
now-disbanded East German secret police worked with Libyan
terrorists.
   The group that planned the La Belle attack was composed mostly
of employees of the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin, the magazine
said.
   Spiegel provided excerpts of its report to news media on
Saturday in advance of its Monday publication.
   Spiegel said the CIA informer apparently was a double agent who
also worked for the East German police, or Stasi, and carried the
code name ``Alba.''
   The agent provided information on the transport of weapons and
explosives and on the possible targets of the attack, Spiegel said.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt reported on Thursday that
East Germany's ousted Communist Party leader Erich Honecker and
Stasi chief Erich Mielke knew about the planned attack on the disco
nearly two weeks before the bombing but did nothing to stop the
Libyans.

   The winds of democracy blowing from
Eastern Europe have reached Kenya, setting off bloody street
battles in what had been considered the most stable nation of black
Africa.
   Several political explosions have rocked Africa south of the
Sahara this year. Demands for reform have shaken other one-party
governments in Ivory Coast, Gabon, Zambia, Cameroon, Zaire and
Benin.
   Analysts say the protests reflect awareness that one-party rule
was swept aside in Eastern Europe last year and the weariness of
Africans with often authoritarian and corrupt leadership.
   In Kenya, at least 28 people were killed in riots that began at
a banned rally for multiparty politics July 7. The demonstrators
stoned a plainclothes policeman and officers responded with tear
gas and gunfire, starting four days of street battles that spread
to other parts of the country.
   Multiparty democracy ``is an international catchword which has
been adopted by all those who have a grievance against the
government,'' said a Western diplomat based in Nairobi.
   ``They may not know what it means, but they know that they are
unhappy and that what they've got hasn't worked,'' said the
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rising food prices, skyrocketing debt, burgeoning populations
and steady economic decline have added fuel to the political fires.
   In Zambia, a failed coup July 1 followed five days of the worst
urban violence in the nation's history. At least 23 people were
killed in student riots over food price increases.
   The students also demanded Western-style democracy and the
ouster of President Kenneth Kaunda, who leads the United National
Independence Party, since 1972 the only legal political movement in
the southern African country.
   Protests against austerity measures and corruption in Ivory
Coast in March grew into violent anti-government demonstrations
demanding that President Felix Houphouet-Boigny relinquish his
30-year monopoly on power.
   The protests forced him to legalize political organizations
other than his own Democratic Party.
   President Omar Bongo of Gabon installed a multiparty system in
May after a coup attempt late last year and student protests in
January and February. France sent troops to protect oil workers
when more riots broke out in May.
   Benin also adopted political pluralism after dropping a
Marxist-Leninist style of government late last year.
   Paul Biya, Cameroon's president, came to power in 1983 promising
more democracy, but his government has cracked down on advocates of
pluralism since February.
   Six people were killed at a pro-democracy rally and authorities
arrested 10 prominent citizens who tried to form an alternative
party to his Democratic Rally of the Cameroonian People.
   Kenya's president, Daniel arap Moi, appears to be following the
Cameroonian model.
   His government has arrested and charged more than 1,400 people
in connection with the riots and threatens continued use of force
against pro-democracy demonstrators. Seventeen people have been
detained without charge, including the most prominent advocates of
multiparty politics.
   Moi, who has governed Kenya since 1978, contends political
pluralism would result in tribal-based parties, ethnic divisions
and even warfare among Kenya's approximately 40 tribes.
   A constitutional amendment in 1982 declared the Kenya African
National Union the only legal political organization, formalizing a
situation that had existed since the last opposition party was
banned in 1969.
   This year, a loose alliance of politicians, lawyers and church
leaders began demanding reform on grounds the one-party system had
led to corruption, election rigging and increasingly authoritarian
rule.
   Signs of economic distress accompany the pressure for reform.
   Kenya has experienced steady growth since independence in 1963,
but recent gains have been underpinned by heavy foreign aid _ now
almost one-third of the budget _ and tourism, sure to be slowed by
the turmoil.
   In recent years, Kenya's 23 million people have been squeezed by
double-digit inflation and stagnant incomes. Prices of such basic
commodities as flour and sugar have risen under economic
restructuring plans of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
   Economic growth in 1989 was put at 5 percent, but population
growth was nearly 4 percent, one of the world's highest rates.
   Roman Catholic bishops last month lamented a widening gap
between rich and poor. Summing up what they called ethical
questions of justice and human rights, the bishops said in a
pastoral letter:
   ``What has emerged clearly from the public debate on the
political system is a general agreement that the present structures
have weaknesses that need to be set right.''
   The Organization of African Unity addressed similar issues at
its annual meeting last week in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia.
   Noting that fundamental changes were occurring in Africa and the
world, the member nations pledged in a final communique to
``recommit ourselves to the full democratization of our societies.''
   Moi was not present for the declaration. He left the meeting on
its first day to return to Kenya, where police battled with those
calling for change.
   He blamed he violence on ``hooligans and drug addicts.''

   About 150 elderly Koreans shouted
anti-Japanese slogans Saturday outside the Japanese Embassy in a
demonstration demanding compensation for victims of World War II.
   Riot police and their buses lined the street along the downtown
embassy's walls and blocked the protesters from approaching. The
protesters, whose family members were drafted by Japan and killed
in the war, dispersed peacefully after asking Japan to compensate
the war victims.
   It was their final rally winding up a monthlong march across the
nation. The march began in the southern port city of Pusan to draw
public attention.
   Japan drafted tens of thousands of Koreans and forced them to
work as laborers or soldiers during World War II. Korea was under
Japan's colonial rule for 35 years, beginning in 1910.
   U.S. and Soviet troops ended the Japanese rule, but the
peninsula was divided immediately into Communist North Korea and
the capitalist South.
   The protesters demand full compensation from Japan and an
apology from Japanese Emperor Akihito for wrongs committed against
Koreans during the war.
   During a visit by South Korean President Roh Tae-woo in May,
Akihito said he felt ``deepest regret'' for the pain Japan's harsh
colonial rule had caused the Korean people.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday cleared the
Communist Party Politburo of the country's most important officials
in a final break with a decades-old precept of total party
domination.
   A new Central Committee, elected on the last day of the party's
28th congress, in turn chose a 24-member Politburo packed with the
Communist Party leaders of the 15 republics, moderate reformers and
political unknowns.
   Gorbachev and his newly elected deputy, Vladimir Ivashko, were
the only holdovers from the previous 12-man Politburo.
   It was clear the Politburo would not wield the total power it
once had. But government ministers remain in place, and they appear
now to be the most powerful men in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev holds government power as Soviet president while he
continues to lead the party. Even though they are no longer
Politburo members, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov remains in
charge of the economy, Dmitri T. Yazov remains defense minister,
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov is still KGB chief and Eduard A. Shevardnadze
remains foreign minister.
   The structural changes move their base of power from the
Communist Party apparatus to the government, a goal that Gorbachev
has espoused for at least two years. He has tried to reshape the
party so it concerns itself with broad policy goals rather than the
country's day-to-day affairs.
   Before Gorbachev's reforms began, any high government position
was secondary to the official's standing in the Communist Party.
Until Saturday, it was understood that combination with a high
party position was an indication of a government official's power.
   ``The new composition of the Politburo underscores that the
party fully breaks with the former practice when it was organically
built into the command and administrative system, and was on the
top of the hierarchy,'' said Ivan Frolov, the editor of the party
newspaper Pravda and a new Politburo member.
   ``It will now be a force competing with other social and
political forces and asserting its advantages mostly in the
ideological and political struggle,'' he told a news conference.
   Ryzhkov, Kryuchkov and Yazov remain members of the 412-member
Central Committee. Shevardnadze, however, does not.
   Shevardnadze and Gorbachev adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev, a
member of Gorbachev's Presidential Council, said during the
congress that they did not see the need to remain on the Politburo.
Gorbachev's traditionalist rival, Yegor K. Ligachev, was trounced
by Ivashko in his bid for the party's No. 2 job and announced he
was going home to Siberia to write a book.
   The leader of the radical reform wing, Boris N. Yeltsin, quit
the party on the day before the congress ended, and some of the
country's most prominent reformers quickly joined him.
   Gorbachev expressed ``contempt'' for those who quit the party,
but acknowledged that the Communists were facing the beginning of a
multiparty system. He pledged that the party would try to help
government bodies rather than simply dominate them.
   Frolov said that in addition to the heads of party organizations
in the Soviet republics, himself, Gorbachev and Ivashko, the new
Politburo will include:
   _Alexander S. Dzasokhov, a former ambassador to Syria and
currently chairman of the Supreme Soviet parliament's International
Affairs Commission. He will be responsible for party ideology.
   _Yuri Prokofiev, the Moscow Communist Party chief, a job that in
the past has entitled the holder to Politburo status. Prokofiev is
known as a moderate reformer.
   _Galina Semyonova, editor-in-chief of ``Peasant Woman''
magazine. She will be responsible for women's issues.
   _Gennady Yanayev, who became head of the Central Council of
Trade Unions this year after labor unrest began spreading through
the country. He will be responsible for international affairs.
   _Oleg Shenin, the party leader in the vast Krasnoyarsk region of
Siberia. His will handle organizational issues.
   _Igor Stroyev, elevated last year to the party's secretariat by
Gorbachev. He will be responsible for farm issues.
   Boris Gidaspov, the Leningrad party chief whom reformers suspect
of being a hard-liner trying to undermine Gorbachev, was elected a
national party secretary.
   It is unclear how the Politburo's function will change, but it
appeared unlikely to meet as frequently. Weekly Politburo meetings
for years thrashed out decisions on all key policy questions.
   By putting the party chiefs of the 15 republics on the
Politburo, Gorbachev has tried to give the party a better forum for
discussing ethnic issues. They range from hard-liners such as
Mikolas Burokjavicus, the head of the small Lithuanian party loyal
to Moscow, to Georgian Givi Gumbaridze, who is leading his
republic's party to endorse the drive for local sovereignty.
   Their selection ensures that the party's highest body no longer
will be dominated by Russians who gradually worked their way
through the party apparatus to important jobs in Moscow.
   Frolov reported a ``very heated'' debate in the Central
Committee over which of two candidates from the Baltic republic of
Estonia to select. They settled on Enn-Arno Sillari, a
representative of the faction that has announced its intention to
split from the party.

<HEAD>Stangeland Leads Charge To Fatten Farm Bill For Minnesota</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With a tough campaign looming back home, Rep.
Arlan Stangeland didn't miss a chance to talk turkey to his
constituents in Washington.
   As the House Agriculture Committee put its final touches on a
new five-year farm program, the Republican won approval for a
turkey research center down the road from his lake house at Pelican
Rapids, Minn.
   Pork-barrel research projects are nothing new in Congress. But
congressional sources say lawmakers rarely use the farm bill to get
them adopted.
   ``It's in the congressman's best interest and the interest of
the people of the 7th District to have that facility in our
district,'' said Tom Hanson, a spokesman for Stangeland.
   After the committee's 16-12 vote to authorize $500,000 for
planning Stangeland's project, other panel members lined up to
fatten the mammoth farm bill with a long menu of special studies or
projects.
   Illinois Rep. Edward Madigan, the committee's ranking
Republican, won approval for research at Illinois State University
on raising fish. Texas members got authorization for researching
prickly pear cactus and mesquite, a prolific Southwest shrub for
which the government once had an eradication program.
   Opponents hope to strip the projects from the farm bill before
it goes to President Bush.
   Critics, who complain that research should be funded on merit
rather than politics, say earmarked programs divert scare federal
funds from existing projects.
   ``They just don't have the money to fund centers for all 50
states that people think are important,'' said Chuck Benbrook,
executive director of the National Academy of Sciences' board on
agriculture.
   ``You can easily argue that we need more turkey research,'' said
Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., who chairs the agriculture committee's
research panel. ``But that's a decision that the Department of
Agriculture should be making.''
   Brown tried in vain to block Stangeland's project, arguing that
it shouldn't be approved without a hearing and testimony from USDA
experts.
   He has allies besides USDA. The Senate Agriculture Committee
turned down members' pet projects and went on to propose a
commission to find wasteful research that Congress should stop.
   If he succeeds in getting House and Senate negotiators to
eliminate the projects, the project sponsors will still enjoy
short-term political gain back home, Brown said.
   If he fails, they will still have to convince the congressional
appropriations committees next year to put the projects in the
federal budget.
   The turkey research center would be run by North Dakota State
University. The school proposed the facility to Stangeland because
scientists want to do genetics research to improve turkey
production in northern climates, Hanson said.
   ``The congressman felt that with Minnesota being second ranked
in turkey production in the country and that since 50 percent of
the turkeys grown in Minnesota are grown in the 7th District it
would be a natural place to have it,'' He said.

   While the London and Houston summits are
behind him, there are plenty of loose ends that President Bush will
have to confront in the next few months.
   Major differences remain among the allies on trade, the
environment and on economic aid to the Soviet Union.
   Face-saving compromises reached by summit partners to achieve
common ground on several issues only guarantee that the divisions
will resurface at a later time.
   At first glance, Bush appears to have gotten most of what he
wanted from the NATO summits in London and the summit of
industrialized democracies in Houston last week.
   ``That's what Bush is good at,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar at
the Brookings Institution who specializes in the presidency. ``He's
brought to international relations the same skills that he's
brought to domestic politics: when you have no money, split the
difference.''
   He added: ``It's a way to put off decisions without leaving
anyone too unhappy.''
   But the compromises either glossed over the lingering
differences or bought participants more time.
   For instance, the allied leaders in Houston were able to put off
the issue of a joint stance on direct economic aid to the Soviet
Union _ favored by West Germany but opposed by the United States _
with a statement that talked about individual aid. It also
commissioned a study of the Soviet economy by the International
Monetary Fund.
   A six-month time frame was put on the IMF study. When that
report is complete, it is likely that the divisions among Western
allies will resurface.
   Bush also made little real headway on the hotly debated subject
of agricultural subsidies.
   Initially, the administration had pressed for an agreement
eliminating all such subsidies by the year 2000. European allies
balked at that notion.
   From the Houston summit came a ``compromise'' in which the
United States basically abandoned its insistence that all
agricultural subsidies be dropped by 2000; and European allies
agreed in principle that the subsidies should be cut.
   However, that just threw the debate back to negotiations under
way in Geneva under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   Those talks, to produce a new set of liberalized international
trading rules, have been going on for three years _ and are bogged
down on the agricultural subsidy issue.
   Bush has said repeatedly that he hopes the trade talks can be
completed _ and an agreement on agricultural subsidies reached _ by
the end of this year.
   But if the year ends and the talks remain deadlocked, Bush will
be forced to address the issue anew.
   On the environment, Bush persuaded allies to retreat from
insisting on a timetable on combatting global warming. However, his
administration remained at odds with Western allies on the subject
_ and with basically the same differences coming out of the summit
as going in.
   At the London NATO summit, allies invited Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to address a meeting of the alliance, probably
in December. And although the precise forum wasn't specified, U.S.
officials said it was unlikely that Gorbachev would address a NATO
meeting without Bush in attendance.
   Furthermore, both Bush and Gorbachev have pledged to try to
complete work on treaties by the end of this year _ one to reduce
conventional forces in Europe and the other cut long-range nuclear
missiles.
   A third Bush-Gorbachev summit seems likely, possibly in Moscow,
to sign a nuclear pact once negotiations on it are complete.
   And completion of talks on reducing conventional forces in
Europe will produce a 35-nation summit among European nations of
both Eastern and Western blocs.
   In the meantime, Bush is turning his attention to domestic
issues and fund-raising excursions to help Republican gubernatorial
and Senate candidates.
   ``He'll switch over to non-stop politicking,'' said White House
spokeswoman Alixe Glen.

   A woman who has camped for two years in
front of the motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated to
protest turning it into a museum is under court order to move her
tent.
   But deputies probably won't try to force her to move until
Monday, an official said today.
   Chancery Court Judge George Lewis told Jacqueline Smith on
Friday she was trespassing and said he would send sheriff's
deputies to move her today if she failed to leave voluntarily.
   Ms. Smith vowed to stay, saying the Lorraine Motel should be
used as housing for the homeless. She repeated that promise this
morning, saying, ``I'm sitting right here.''
   Despite the judge's statement, Shelby County deputies were not
expected to enforce Lewis' order until Monday, said Wes Newman, a
dispatcher for the sheriff's department.
   ``The information we have is the order has not been signed. It
will be signed Monday morning and probably will be executed that
same day,'' Newman said.
   He added that sheriff's department employees who serve civil
court orders generally do not work on weekends and no one had been
called in for special assigment.
   The Lorraine is to become the centerpiece of a $9 million museum
called the National Civil Rights Center, scheduled to open July 4,
1991.
   King was assassinated at the small motel in 1968.
   Ms. Smith, 39, a former employee and resident of the motel, was
evicted from the Lorraine by sheriff's deputies after it was shut
down to make way for the museum.
   The deputies deposited her on a sidewalk in front of motel March
2, 1988, and she has been there ever since.
   Lewis issued his order for her to move on a petition from
Jameson-Vaccaro Construction Co. Inc., the primary contractor for
the museum.
   Anthony Vaccaro, project manager for the museum, said Ms. Smith
is camped in a spot that must be torn up for utility lines. The
sidewalk she is sitting on also is to be removed, he said.
   Ms. Smith has rejected requests to move her tent across the
street, Vaccaro said.
   Demolition work began at the Lorraine last year and several
preliminary construction jobs have been completed on the
2-square-block project site. Lewis' order against Ms. Smith covers
the entire site.
   Generally, museum developers have ignored Ms. Smith, but Vaccaro
said she was in the way. He said he had to stop work for several
days because of her.
   Vaccaro said his company faces fines of up to $2,500 a day if
the museum is not finished on schedule.
   The Lorraine, which was a popular stopping place for blacks when
Memphis hotels were segregated, was falling apart in 1982 when a
group of concerned citizens bought it at a foreclosure auction.
   The group formed the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation and
spent the next several years convincing state and local officials
to build the museum.
   Title to the property was turned over to the state.

   After spending two years in an East German
prison for trying to break through the Iron Curtain to freedom,
Steffaen Petry is determined to live the free-spirited life of a
cowboy on Wyoming's open range.
   ``From the time I was very little, I wanted to be a cowboy. From
a little boy I knew about John Wayne,'' the 22-year-old said
through an interprreter during a break in work at the Wyoming
Hereford Ranch.
   For the past few days, Petry has been pulling weeds and planting
trees at the ranch just east of Cheyenne. He has yet to brand a
calf, drive cattle or shoot a rattlesnake, but says: ``I'm so
happy.''
   He saddled a horse for the first time Wednesday and rode across
the green plains of southeastern Wyoming.
   ``I know that America is a free land and from Cheyenne where I
am, I can see land, open spaces and houses _ not only large
apartment buildings,'' he said, sitting on a golden mare in a field
of tall grass. ``It's so crowded in Germany. It's so open here.''
   Petry decided to head to the Cowboy State in late June _ little
more than six months after he was released from prison _ when he
read a West German newspaper article saying there was a shortage of
cowboys in Wyoming. Foreign workers are being allowed to take
cowhand jobs in parts of the West where there is a shortage of
qualified American cowboys.
   Fantasizing about the freedom and expanse of the Wild West he
had seen on television and read about in books, he sold his meager
belongings, purchased an airplane ticket and arrived at the
Cheyenne airport on a tourist visa.
   He knew no one and could say only one word in English _
``cowboy.''
   He approached an airport maintenance worker who had a friend who
spoke German. He finally was hooked up with the Sloan Hale family,
who speak German and own the sprawling Wyoming Hereford Ranch.
   For now Petry is staying with the Hales, who serve as his
interpreters, until he can find a rancher with an opening for a
cowboy who will sponsor him in hopes he can replace his tourist
visa with a work permit.
   He wants to spend the rest of his life in America, but worries
that his stay could be short-lived.
   ``For me, right now I am free. But I won't know true freedom or
what freedom really is until I know I can stay here,'' he said.
   Despite his desire to be a cowboy, he wore a white cotton blazer
over a souvenir ``Colorado'' T-shirt, jeans, white socks and black
loafers.
   ``Not until I am a real cowboy, after I work for a year as a
cowboy, will I wear a cowboy hat,'' he said. ``Then I will be a
real cowboy.''
   Petry, a mechanic and son of a dock worker, felt like thousands
of other young East Germans before the Berlin Wall tumbled down
last fall _ isolated and yearning for freedom.
   ``I had no freedom. I could not purchase anything. I could not
go anywhere,'' he said. ``There was absolutely no freedom of
opinion. I couldn't even say I would like a Coca-Cola. If I were to
say that bad things are bad and they didn't think they were bad,
they could put you in jail.''
   On May 12, 1988, Petry and a friend decided to leave.
   ``It was very late at night. I tried to escape through a forest
and through a fence. I cut the fence and then I came to `No Man's
Land' and the West German border was right there. The border was
right next to us,'' he said.
   ``At that time four people came and arrested us. We were taken
to a holding place for 14 days until they decided what to do with
us. I was in prison for (almost) two years.''
   But now, he is confident that no matter what happens, his life
will be better.
   ``I told my parents if I did not write, please don't have any
worry. Everything will be fine.''

<TEXT>
   To hear Neil Bush tell it, he's ``just a Denver
guy trying to make a living and raise a family,'' and he's
bewildered and angry at the attention he's receiving.
   Neil Bush, 35, slim, tanned, blond father of three children,
epitomizes the young, enterprising businessmen who came to Colorado
in the early 1980s to get rich in the oil business.
   ``We lived month to month, begged for money from time to time,
and our business was relatively dormant,'' Bush recalls. But he
relishes that time in his life.
   Like his father, Bush speaks in deliberate, run-on sentences,
tipping his head during delivery, jabbing his finger occasionally,
laughing an engaging, hiccuppy sort of laugh, displaying
near-perfect teeth.
   He is comfortable enough in front of a television camera to be a
political commentator, which he was, briefly, two years ago at KMGH
in Denver.
   Lately, however, Bush hasn't been in the spotlight voluntarily.
   Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal
regulators in September on his role as a director of the bankrupt
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan. Some Democrats are pushing for
a special prosecutor to examine the case.
   He has been accused of conflict of interest and failure to
disclose ties to men who received loans from Silverado, but has
said he has done nothing wrong. His father has defended his ``honor
and integrity'' but has promised to stay out of the investigation.
   The subject makes Neil Bush angry. While some maintain he played
a major role in pushing through suspicious loans while a director
of Silverado, he is enraged that Democrats are now making political
hay out of his predicament.
   ``Neil Bush is it for the Democrats. I'm the highest-profile guy
they have to shoot at out there,'' he said in an interview last
week.
   ``As a director of Silverado I acted prudently, I acted
responsibly. I acted and took my responsibilities seriously, and I
acted with diligence in overseeing the activities of Silverado.''
He also expresses anger at what he calls ``government
mismanagement'' in the way troubled savings institutions are being
sold off.
   Neil Bush played his most prominent role on the hot, steamy
night of Aug. 17, 1988, at the Republican National Convention in
New Orleans, when he delivered all of Colorado's delegates to help
seal his father's nomination for president.
   It was a heady moment for the third of George and Barbara Bush's
four sons, and it led to suggestions Neil Bush might have the stuff
from which U.S. House or Senate candidates are made. The
possibility had him shrugging and smiling and saying ``maybe.''
   His job then, he told reporters, was to help his father's
campaign. ``I'd hate to be the only son to have lost his home state
for his dad.''
   Dyslexic as a child, Bush practiced reading exercises until he
was able to overcome his problem, his brother George recalled. He
eventually earned undergraduate and master's degrees in business
from Tulane University.
   Until a few months ago, Neil and Sharon Bush and their three
children lived in a tan brick, two-story home in a friendly,
established neighborhood in central Denver.
   Former neighbors say they would often pile into the family Volvo
for weekend excursions. And they were community oriented, with Neil
serving on the Children's Museum board and Sharon co-chairing the
1989 Children's Hospital Gala.
   The family moved to a new house, a $550,000 structure on
Denver's wealthier, newer, southeast side. ``It offers privacy,
something that I now thrive on,'' Bush says.
   His downtown office is light and airy, with Western paintings
and a clear view to the west, where the Rockies can be seen on most
days. His desk carries a name plate, ``Mr. Bush,'' which belonged
to his grandfather, Prescott Bush, when he was a U.S. Senator from
Connecticut.
   It is more lavish than he was accustomed to when he was a
partner in a fledgling exploration company, JNB Exploration Co.
   JNB paid him a salary _ he won't say how much _ but the business
was later sold, in 1989, and Bush now heads Apex Energy, also an
exploration company.
   ``My business is oil and gas,'' he said.
   Bush says the oil business has been interesting, and he made
some profit selling lease-hold interests.
   ``The only problem is,'' he recalls with a smile, ``even though
we kept things going and everything was in pretty good shape in
terms of operations _ we didn't find any oil.
   ``It's a pretty high-risk business. But we were successful to
the extent we managed to put prospects together and sell them,
which is probably why we attracted the partners we did.''

<TEXT>
   A factory worker could wear a crucifix in
public. A mother noticed she could complain about food shortages
without going to jail. And a student began to talk openly with
friends about the Romanian revolution.
   Changes have come recently to Albania, Europe's last bastion of
hard-line Communist rule, according to refugees interviewed
Saturday shortly after they arrived in Italy.
   But they said their Balkan nation of 3.2 million remains a land
of fear and the government remains committed to communism.
   ``The government has done things only with words,'' a
29-year-old mother said on condition of anonymity. ``For ideas, the
desire of the people to live better, they haven't done a thing.''
   The woman was one of 4,500 people ferried Friday from Albania,
where in their quest for freedom they had escaped into Western
embassies, some braving police gunfire.
   A day later, 804 refugees were in the abandoned army camp
outside Brindisi waiting to be resettled in Italy. About 3,200
traveled on to West Germany and others to France.
   At the Italian camp, known as Restinco, the Albanians stood in
line for new clothes, ate steaming plates of lasagna, showered away
days of grime and reflected on the society they fled.
   The mother, watching her 3-year-old son scampering amid rows of
cots in a makeshift dormitory, said the government had become
slightly more tolerant as shortages of meat, fruit and vegetables
grew.
   ``A few years ago, even if you just said you lacked something,
you could go to jail,'' she said.
   But criticizing the government directly was still forbidden, she
said. Like most others interviewed, she declined to give her name
for fear of endangering relatives still in Albania.
   On the other side of the room, a young factory worker sat on a
cot beside her physically handicapped little brother. A cross on a
white string dangled from her neck.
   She said she started wearing it two months ago, when the
Albanian government of Ramiz Alia introduced limited reforms,
including some religious freedom and travel abroad, which Albanians
were not permitted for 45 years.
   Albanians, she said, took heart from last year's democratic
revolutions in Eastern Europe, particularly the revolt in Romania,
previously one of the region's harshest Communist regimes. Many
Albanians were able to follow the events on Italian and Yugoslav
television.
   ``There's so much discussion but so much fear,'' she said in
Italian. ``People are afraid the police will beat us, that they'll
get years in jail for one word.''
   She said anger at the government was rising. ``I don't know, I'm
so afraid a war will break out, they pit people against each
other,'' she said.
   Several other refugees said they detected growing signs of
protest. In May bombs exploded at a bookstore and near a statue of
Stalin in the Albanian capital, three men said. Several said there
were demonstrations recently in the northern Albanian city of
Shkoder as well as in Tirana.
   ``People are not as afraid as they were a year ago,'' said a
19-year-old student who identified himself as Ralph.``After what
happened in Romania, the people burst. They began to talk about
it.''
   Still, none of the refugees knew of any organized opposition to
the government.
   And they said fear was still rampant.
   ``Out of every four men, one is a police agent,'' said Arben,
33, a factory worker, as he stood in line for new clothing. Like
others, he gave only one name.
   ``Even in the embassies there were provocateurs'' sent by the
government, he said. Most apparently left the embassies before the
boatlift, he said.
   Burhan, a 41-year-old mechanic, told his own story to indicate
why Albanians are so afraid.
   One day in 1973 as he walked with a friend in Tirana, Burhan
said thought ``the theory of Lenin is old now, and I had a desire
to go abroad.''
   Seven years later, the friend was arrested and during torture
repeated what Burhan had said. The mechanic was sent to prison from
1980 until last November.
   ``Look, his bones are broken from the torture,'' said Ralph,
running a reporter's fingers over Burhan's knobby collarbone.
   Most of the refugees said they hoped to move to the United
States.
   As his father looked on, Ralph said that in the United States, a
man could be whatever he wanted ``if he works hard, of course.''
   ``Our people believe only in America,'' the father said.

<HEAD>Cherkassky, Bell at Mostly Mozart Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shura Cherkassky was 12 years old and making his
first U.S. tour when he played piano for President Harding.
   Violinist Joshua Bell was a year older, and Ronald Reagan was
president, when he debuted with the Philadelphia Orchestra after
winning the Seventeen Magazine-General Motors competition.
   Cherkassky and Bell took the stage separately at the Mostly
Mozart Festival Friday night in an interesting contrast of blooming
and ripened careers. Both performances reversed expectations.
   Gerard Schwarz, Mostly Mozart's music director and conductor of
the Seattle Symphony, and the festival orchestra were a fine,
sometimes brilliant, constant.
   But not at first.
   The evening opened with Mendelssohn's Overture to ``Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' which, because of its delicacy, really has to be
perfect _ perfect wind entrances in the expanding opening chords,
perfectly together strings in the fleet passages. The orchestra,
unfortunately, was merely almost perfect.
   Then came the seeming teen-age idol.
   Bell, of Bloomington, Ind., is 23, and looks 18. London records
publicity pictures have him posing in jeans, sneakers, leather
jacket and violin perched on thigh. But youth and image became
trivial in his performance of the Mendelssohn violin concerto.
   His interpretation showed a depth of understanding of the notes
as music, not just a solo display. Bell played stylishly, though
his flair never failed to serve the musical line, and he showed a
tremendous sense of ease not just with technical difficulties but
with the music itself.
   He was unfazed when a heathen began clapping at a particularly
delicate moment in the first movement cadenza. He looked up, and
went on with his concentration unbroken.
   If there was a weakness, it was in the slow movement, where
Bell's sound seemed to lack warmth. That might have been the fault
of Avery Fisher Hall's dry acoustics.
   In the final movement, he also seemed to back away from
ascending lines leading to big orchestral climaxes. But the final
Allegro build-up was explosive. At the end, Schwarz seemed
delighted, smiling and slapping Bell on the back.
   The Russian-born Cherkassky, 79, who followed intermission with
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466, was a pupil of
the legendary Polish pianist Josef Hoffman. Hoffman himself studied
with Anton Rubinstein, one of the great pianists of the 19th
century, making Cherkassky a direct descendent of a Romantic age.
   Cherkassky's idiosyncracies were there _ a balding, compact man,
he hunched over the piano, stared down intently at his fingers,
popped up at the conductor in anticipation of the orchestra's
entrance.
   The performance, though, lacked freedom and his expected
Romantic stamp.
   Cherkassky played with a curious intimacy and restraint, perhaps
out of character for this stormy and tragic concerto, one of only
two in a minor key by Mozart.
   What Cherkassky did show was an extraordinary range of dynamic
gradations and color, tonal beauty and an incisive sense of rhythm.
   The orchestra was superlative in the opening of the concerto.
Schwarz maintained a wonderful hush and sculpted the lines deftly.
Conductor and players generally kept up the high level in Mozart's
``Haffner'' symphony, one the composer's most exciting symphonies.
   The players reverted to a bit of their midsummer night
imprecision in the first movement, and sometimes sounded hurried.
But overall, Schwarz brought out a good amount of detail and ended
with a thrilling virtuoso display in the demonically difficult
final Presto.

<HEAD>Strike Emboldens Sandinistas in Nicaraguan Power Struggle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emboldened by their latest strike, the
Sandinistas appear more determined than ever to make good on their
promise to ``govern from below.''
   ``This is just the beginning,'' the party newspaper Barricada
warned in an editorial, a feeling echoed by the private sector.
   The 10-day Sandinista-led strike that ended Thursday was the
second major walkout by public employees since President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro took office on April 25.
   The strikes forced Mrs. Chamorro to grant broad concessions on
wages and job security for government employees and to put on hold
parts of her plan to return Nicaragua to a free market economy.
   The strike accord also shelved her plans to return confiscated
farmland.
   The Sandinistas claim this clause as their greatest victory of
the strike. The business community regards it as Mrs. Chamorro's
greatest betrayal.
   Gilberto Cuadra, head of the nation's leading business group,
the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, said Mrs. Chamorro's
concessions will encourage labor unrest.
   ``The campaign of strikes will continue,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas ``are trying to govern behind the scenes. But
the reality is that they aren't governing nor are they allowing
anyone else to govern,'' he said.
   The latest strike culminated in four days of violence that
claimed at least four lives. Paving-stone barricades fortified by
burning tires and armed strikers paralyzed the city. Gunfire
crackled across the capital.
   In the countryside, where the planting season was under way,
farm workers struck, diminishing hopes for the bumper export crops
on which economic recovery depends.
   At the same time, Mrs. Chamorro came under attack from her own
vice president, Virgilio Godoy, and the private sector. The
president, they charged, was buckling under Sandinista pressure.
   Faced with chaos in the streets, Mrs. Chamorro settled the
strike by giving in to many of the leftist demands. And faced with
revolt in the conservative ranks, she appealed for a national
policy dialogue.
   The Sandinistas claimed victory.
   ``Workers have achieved ratification of union participation in
the decisions that affect the economic life of the country,''
Barricada claimed.
   Former President Daniel Ortega was blunt.
   ``One must deal with Sandinismo, with the revolution, to have
stability in this country,'' he said.
   After Mrs. Chamorro's landslide victory in the Feb. 25
elections, Ortega vowed the Sandinistas would ``govern from below''
to block any attempt to dismantle more than a decade of
revolutionary policy.
   Mrs. Chamorro had said she would privatize state-owned
businesses, return farmland confiscated after the 1979 revolution
and trim the 65,000-person state payroll.
   Most of those plans were changed by concessions she made in the
two strikes.
   Presidential advisers say that before the Sandinistas left power
they prepared the ground for future conflicts with the government.
   The Sandinistas, who control two of the nation's three daily
newspapers and two-thirds of its radio stations, armed tens of
thousands of people, urging them to ``defend the conquests of the
revolution.''
   They passed laws legalizing strikes and guaranteeing the jobs of
thousands of public sector workers.
   They also stopped currency devaluations, a longstanding feature
of Nicaraguan life. At the same time, the amount of money in
circulation rose sharply, Central Bank records show.
   When Mrs. Chamorro took office, she inherited a bankrupt
government, a nearly worthless currency and a huge payroll. Her
government has since devalued the cordoba more than 20 times and
plans to issue a new currency on par with the dollar.

<HEAD>Science Making Progress Against Ravages of Old Age</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are tackling the problems of growing
old and finding some success helping frail, flabby bodies become
youthful again.
   There's no cure for old age, but scientists are developing the
next best thing: therapies that can forestall and even reverse some
of the most disabling and disturbing effects of the inevitable.
   ``There has been just a remarkable increase in interest, at long
last, in the problems of older people,'' said Dr. Reubin Andres, an
aging expert at Johns Hopkins University. ``It's a hopeful time
that we are living in. A lot of advances are being made. But that
doesn't mean that we have the youth pill.''
   While indeed none is exactly a youth pill, scientists reported
three discoveries in the past month that could help make growing
old just a little easier:
   _The most dramatic announcement was the effects of human growth
hormone, which spurs the body to make muscle. Six months of
injections wiped 20 years off elderly recipients' sagging physiques.
   Doctors cautioned that they don't yet know how many people could
benefit. But if the hormone works as well as they hope, it could
give many the strength to keep walking and fending for themselves
well into old age.
   _Another team demonstrated that the prescription medicine
etidronate can strengthen aging spines. It stops and even reverses
the gradual loss of backbone. This sharply reduces the risk of
crushed vertebrae, a common and painful condition especially common
among elderly women, that results in stooped posture.
   _Taking an entirely different tack, a group of doctors showed
that even nursing home patients in their 90s can build up their
muscles through regular exercise.
   It was just coincidence that the reports came out at the same
time. But the three studies share an important theme of geriatric
care: All are steps toward helping folks stay active, mobile and
independent into old age.
   The need for this research is obvious. Growing old is a growing
problem. The Census Bureau estimates that by the year 2030, when
baby boomers hit their senior years, there will be 66 million
Americans over age 65 _ 2{ times more than 1980.
   Certainly, even the most optimistic scientific seers do not
expect to conquer death any time soon. The human body is simply
built to wear out. Beyond gray hair and wrinkles, eyesight dims,
balance fails, muscles turn to flab. But these breakdowns are not
quite so certain as they once seemed.
   ``The general attitude has been that aging is a genetically
programmed, cellular event, determined when you are born,'' said
Dr. Seymour Reichlin, chief of endocrinology at New England Medical
Center.
   ``It's programmed so that cells die at a certain rate, and there
you are,'' he said. ``The data with growth hormone raises the issue
of whether some of the aging process is not genetically programmed,
or perhaps the program can be changed.''
   Hormones, in fact, are one of the hottest areas of aging
research. The body generates lots of these proteins to regulate
growth and other chores. In the fourth decade of life and beyond,
much of this production begins to taper off. So scientist are
asking: Why not put them back?
   Hormone replacement is nothing new. Doctors have long advised
women to take estrogen supplements to keep them healthy after their
bodies slow the natural production of this sex hormone following
menopause. But now scientists are looking into keeping the body
youthful with other varieties.
   Among the possibilities:
   _Testosterone. This is the major male sex hormone. Many men lose
its production when they get old. Restoring it could help them
build up muscle and regain lost sex drive.
   _Somatomedin C. Human growth hormone stimulates the body to make
this protein, which in turn promotes muscle production.
   _Blood cell growth factors. The body produces a host of these
hormones to stimulate the production of white blood cells that
guard against cancer and infection. Fine-tuning these hormones may
keep people healthier in old age.
   _Nerve cell growth factors. In theory, at least, these proteins
might help the body replace brain cells that are destroyed by
Alzheimer's disease or lost through the natural wear and tear of
aging.
   Dr. Evan Hadley, chief of the geriatrics branch of the National
Institute on Aging, and others believe even more ills of aging will
soon be controlled, if not cured.
   ``I am very hopeful,'' he said. ``There is a real possibility of
significantly reducing the problems of physical frailty in old age
over the next decade.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has succeeded in reshaping
the Communist Party in his own centrist image to brace for a
challenge from workers and radicals who are quitting the party to
organize an opposition.
   The 28th congress of the Communist Party, billed in advance as a
bastion of hard-liners, closed Friday after dumping most of the Old
Guard. The delegates also accepted much of Gorbachev's plan to
transfer decision-making from the party to the government _ which
he also heads.
   But the government faces increasing discontent, especially among
workers, as well as ethnic unrest that is shredding the country at
the edges.
   The struggle intensified Wednesday, when coal miners across the
country staged a one-day protest strike and urged workers to leave
the party.
   The miners also are organizing an independent trade union to
press demands that the government resign and that all Communist
Party assets be nationalized and distributed to rival political
groups.
   Disgruntled workers might flock to the banner of Boris N.
Yeltsin, who sent a shock through the Kremlin Thursday by walking
out of the Communist congress, quitting the party. He said his
first loyalty was to his new job, president of Russia, by far the
largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Other leading reformers followed Yeltsin out of the party,
including the new mayors of Moscow and Leningrad, the biggest
Soviet cities.
   Despite the split in the party, the first since 1921, Gorbachev
was jovial Friday as he closed the two-week Communist congress,
which many had predicted would be dominated by hard-liners.
   Instead, Gorbachev scored a sweeping victory, removing his
leading hard-line critic, Yegor K. Ligachev, from the Politburo. He
also won approval of a restructuring of top party bodies to
transfer power to the government.
   The danger for Gorbachev is that central authorities could lose
touch with the people.
   The people, in turn, are using Gorbachev's democratic reforms to
win control of legislatures throughout the country and challenge
central government and party bodies.
   The atmosphere was tense in Moscow before the national party
congress because it followed harsh criticism of Gorbachev's
performance by traditionalists at a congress of party members in
the Russian republic.
   Ligachev led the attack, urging Gorbachev to relinquish the top
party job if he retained the national presidency.
   Ligachev complained that the party Politburo, the body that
traditionally has ruled the Soviet Union, had been excluded from
discussions of economic reform. Gorbachev had instead steered the
program through the newly created Presidential Council.
   The mood was so foreboding that Yeltsin and other reformers
recommended postponing the national congress.
   But the workers and reformers took the offensive. Nine minutes
into the first session, miner Vladimir I. Bludov demanded that
Gorbachev and other leaders resign.
   Gorbachev brushed aside the suggestion, noting that the congress
was due to elect the general secretary, the Politburo and the
Central Committee.
   He also told delegates that senior party leaders opposed his
proposal to expand the Politburo from 12 to 30 members and to
create a new deputy party leader's post to direct day-day-affairs.
   The congress was the stormiest since 1921, when the party faced
armed uprisings from angry workers and sailors, and the most
momentous since 1956, when Nikita S. Khrushchev denounced the late
dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   The warmest applause was for Ligachev's warning that
anti-Communist forces were gaining strength. But his tone was
milder than at the Russian Communist Party congress, and he did not
repeat his call for Gorbachev to relinquish the party leadership.
   Other hard-liners tempered their rhetoric and, together with
moderates, drew together under Gorbachev. Many said that although
they objected to one man heading the party and the government
simultaneously, he was the only person capable of holding the party
together.
   Gorbachev engineered his election as chairman of the committee
drafting new party rules. Working behind the scenes, he revived his
plans to restructure the party leadership.
   The congress voted to expand the Central Committee from 249 to
412 members, most of them centrists like Gorbachev.
   The delegates also approved a Gorbachev plan that drastically
cut the Politburo's power, doubling its size and including the
party heads of the 15 republics _ a move designed to ease ethnic
tension.
   Moreover, he eliminated the Old Guard. Of the 24 Politburo
members, only Gorbachev and his newly elected deputy Vladimir
Ivashko remain from the former group. Only Gorbachev has been a
member of the body more than eight months.

<HEAD>Abortion Activists Mount Initiative Drives</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion activists in at least three states are taking their
fight directly to the people with initiative petition drives
designed to steer around the opposition of elected officials.
   The initiative campaigns reflect a nationwide trend toward
direct voter involvement in hotly disputed issues, and a
frustration on the part of abortion activists with the pace of
change.
   Anti-abortion forces appear to have gathered enough signatures
for two ballot initiatives in Oregon, and for a legislative
initiative in Michigan that gives legislators another chance to
pass abortion restrictions that had been vetoed by the governor.
   In Nevada, pro-choice forces have succeeded in getting an
abortion rights measure on the November ballot.
   Other abortion-related initiative drives were mounted this year
in Oklahoma, Colorado, Missouri and Washington, but all but
Washington's appear to be dead or dying.
   Pro-choice forces are still collecting signatures in Washington
for an initiative designed to ensure that abortion remains legal
even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, the ruling
that legalized abortion.
   Abortion-related initiatives have become an increasingly popular
tactic in the 17 years since Roe vs. Wade. There have been 11 such
initiatives since 1973, including four in 1986 and three in 1988.
   ``It's accelerating,'' said Patrick B. McGuigan, who studies
voter initiatives for the Free Congress Research and Education
Foundation in Washington. That's hardly surprising, he added, given
the volatility of the issue and the general growth of initiatives
as a political tool.
   Anti-abortion forces lost all four battles in 1986 and won all
three in 1988. This year, McGuigan said, ``I think you can expect
mixed results.''
   Both sides in the abortion battle say they would prefer to gain
their victories in the legislatures. But in some cases, they say,
the initiative is the best tool.
   ``Our basic perspective,'' said Burke Balch of the National
Right to Life Committee, ``is that, in general, we resort to
initiatives and referenda only as a last resort.''
   That reasoning prompted anti-abortion forces in Oregon, where
the Legislature leans strongly toward abortion rights, to mount
petition drives to place two initiatives on the November ballot.
   One would outlaw abortion except in cases of rape or incest or
to save a woman's life. The other requires a parent to be notified
of a minor's abortion 48 hours in advance.
   Backers of the initiatives already have filed what they believe
are enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. State officials
are in the process of checking the signatures to verify them.
   In Michigan, anti-abortion activists seized on the initiative as
a way of foiling Gov. James Blanchard, who vetoed a parental
consent bill earlier this year.
   Right to Life of Michigan has filed petitions bearing 333,187
signatures _ about 140,000 more than are required.
   If enough signatures are valid, the parental consent issue would
go back to the Legislature this fall. If it passes, Blanchard would
not be allowed to veto it. If it loses, the issue will be put
before voters, probably in November 1992.
   In Washington, where the initiative system is similar,
signatures are due by Jan. 3.
   The Nevada initiative, which has already qualified for the
ballot, would bar state legislators from changing the state's
existing abortion law.
   In Colorado, an anti-abortion initiative campaign was set back
earlier this month when the state Supreme Court found that it was
not clearly drafted and ordered it rewritten.
   ``Effectively, this blows us out of the water,'' said William L.
Woodley, president of the Coalition for Your Right to Know, which
sponsored the parental consent measure.
   In Missouri, an abortion rights group said last week that it
would fall short of the number of signatures needed to place a
constitutional amendment on the ballot. The measure would have
repealed the restrictive abortion law that the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld last year in its Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services
ruling.
   In Oklahoma, a group of Baptist ministers is backing a petition
drive that would allow voters to decide whether to outlaw abortions
except in cases of rape, incest or fetal deformity or when the
mother is at risk.
   However, even if the sponsors collect enough signatures,
abortion rights activists have already said they would file suit
against the measure and it appears likely to be delayed beyond the
November election.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Young long ago learned the art of the
colorblind appeal. It's the way he won white support in his
successful races for Congress and for mayor of Atlanta, and it's
the way he's trying to become the first black governor of Georgia.
   How well the strategy is working will be shown by Tuesday's
Democratic primary. But some black supporters wonder if Young has
erred in ignoring his strength, the black vote that nearly everyone
has presumed to be his.
   ``I think some of his advisers have cautioned him to do that ...
to concentrate on the white vote, play it low-key with the black
vote,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and a staunch Young supporter.
   ``If that's his strategy, I think it's a mistake,'' Lowery said.
``I think ... you've got to stir up what you've got. And what he's
got is the potential at least, guaranteed, to (make) the runoff, if
he turns out the black vote.''
   Young is among five Democratic candidates running in Tuesday's
primary. Georgia requires an Aug. 7 runoff between the top two
vote-getters if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the
vote in the primary.
   A poll in Saturday's editions of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution showed Lt. Gov. Zell Miller was favored by 36
percent of the likely Democratic voters surveyed, with Young
favored by 30 percent and the other three contenders trailing far
behind. The telephone survey of 829 people had a margin of error of
3 percentage points.
   A black Macon minister, the Rev. Ed Smith, raised questions
about Young's campaign at a meeting with the candidate earlier this
summer.
   ``One of the concerns I've heard is you're taking the black vote
for granted,'' Smith told Young. ``That is a concern in the black
community.''
   The concern stems in part from Young's public campaign. It began
not with the off-the-cuff, folksy stump speech he's so good at, but
with a formal address taped before an invitation-only crowd in an
Atlanta TV studio.
   Young's TV ads _ steady-as-he-goes pieces which could come from
a Politics 101 textbook _ pointedly show him shaking hands with a
white supporter in Elberton, talking to a white cop and a black cop
in Augusta, strolling through an integrated classroom of kids in
Atlanta.
   Some days, those spots have been the total of Young's public
campaign. Other candidates summon the press on a sometimes daily
basis; Young's campaign has, at times, told reporters that his
media representatives can't be reached, and taken more than a week
to fill requests for the candidate's schedule.
   The last would-be history-maker to campaign in Georgia _ 1988
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson _ made a staple of
fiery, emotional speeches to black congregations. Young is more
likely to be found preaching his gospel of economic growth to a
white civic club crowd.
   Young needs to have at least some support from white voters.
Only about 25 percent of the voting-age population in Georgia is
black, and he needs twice that to garner the Democratic nomination.
   On a recent Sunday, the Rev. Jasper Williams blasted Young from
the pulpit at Atlanta's predominantly black Salem Baptist Church.
He criticized Young for not supporting the poor, the Jackson
campaign or a popular but controversial black Atlanta police
official, Deputy Chief Eldrin Bell.
   ``I've not seen nothing he's done for us _ nada,'' Williams said.
   And with Bell looking on, Williams gave a hug to Young's chief
rival, Miller, who has traditionally enjoyed black support
statewide, albeit without having to face a top black candidate like
Young.
   The Young camp dismissed the criticism from Williams. ``We're
not going to spend a lot of time responding to one guy,'' said
spokesman Nehl Horton.
   Indeed, the Young campaign has taken steps to get out the black
vote. One fulltime staffer's chief duty is to serve as liaison to
black preachers, and the campaign counts ministers from more than
1,000 churches among its supporters.
   ``Out goal is to get out our vote _ Andy's supporters from
across the state,'' said deputy campaign manager Marian Jones.
``One of the key areas in contacting these voters will be through
the churches.''
   ``At Cascade, we do it every Sunday,'' said Lowery, pastor of
Atlanta's Cascade United Methodist Church. ``We encourage people to
be good citizens ... get out and vote.''
   Young ``has overwhelming support among black minsters and black
church people,'' Lowery said.
   ``Here in Savannah, you can't find a black preacher who does not
support Andy Young,'' said the Rev. Bennie Mitchell of the Savannah
Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance.
   About the only overt injection of race into the campaign has
come through what the Young camp says was a mistake. A hired
telemarketing firm was telling voters they should support Young in
order to keep Lester Maddox, the avowed segregationist from the
1960s, from becoming governor again.
   In truth, Maddox is a distant fifth in the latest polls, and few
people other than the ebullient former governor have given him a
chance.
   Maddox blasted Young for the ``dastardly act'' of bringing race
into the campaign. Young, who maintained he had no knowledge of the
anti-Maddox calls, fired the marketing firm.

<HEAD>Government Minister Resigns After Storm Over Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior government minister resigned Saturday,
two days after a magazine published an interview in which he
accused Germany of trying to take over Europe and called the French
obedient ``poodles'' to the Germans.
   Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley had retracted the
comments Thursday, but the interview provoked outrage in his own
Conservative Party, as well as from the Labor Party and other
opposition groups. A spokesman for West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl had said he ``was not amused.''
   The chain-smoking, blunt-talking Ridley was one of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's closest allies and an architect of her
programs to sell government-owned industries.
   ``Personally I shall greatly miss your loyal support for the
policies we both believe in so deeply,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a
letter to Ridley, an ideological soulmate who had been a member of
her Cabinet since 1983.
   She appointed Peter Lilley to replace Ridley.
   In an interview published in The Spectator magazine, Ridley said
plans for a European monetary union ``is all a German racket
designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted.
This rushed takeover by the Germans on the worst possible basis,
with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely
intolerable.''
   He also condemned the ``breath-taking arrogance'' of a European
Community run by ``17 unelected reject politicians.''
   ``I'm not against giving up sovereignty in principle, but not to
this lot. You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler,
frankly,'' Ridley said.
   Ridley was leading a trade mission in Budapest when the
controversy erupted and issued a short statement saying he withdrew
his remarks.
   In his resignation letter, Ridley again lashed out at plans for
a European monetary union.
   ``Nothing but harm will come from trying to force (Europe) into
the straight-jacket of a single currency, with economic policy
decided by people who are not accountable to the electors and
taxpayers. It would result in economic domination by the country
with the strongest currency in the Community.''
   ``But I recognize the difficulties which my failure to use more
measured words have caused and, in the circumstances, I think it
would be best if I now left the Government,'' he wrote.
   Ridley also wrote: ``In particular I deeply resent the journal's
assertion that I associate present-day Germany with the aggression
of the past. I do not hold that view.''
   His departure leaves Mrs. Thatcher ``more isolated than she has
been since she took office in 1979,'' wrote Anthony Bevins,
political editor of The Independent newspaper. ``So much so that it
is well-nigh impossible to identify anyone in Cabinet who now
totally supports her anti-European Community sentiments.''
   Polls comissioned by three Sunday newspapers in London found a
majority or plurality in favor of Ridley's departure: 53 percent in
The Sunday Telegraph, 52 percent in The Correspondent and 48
percent in The Sunday Times.
   However, the Sunday Telegraph's Gallup poll, based on interviews
with 514 adults, found Conservatives evenly split _ 45 percent
either way _ on whether Ridley should stay or go.
   Respondents also rejected Ridley's claim that monetary union was
a ``German racket'' _ 68 percent disagreed in the Sunday Telegraph
and 59 percent in the Sunday Times poll by the MORI polling
organization.

of resignation, released by the prime minister's office.

<TEXT>
   Dear Margaret,
   In view of the controversy aroused by the publication of an
article in the Spectator this week, I think that now is the time
for me to leave your government, since I have already made clear to
you that I had decided not to contest the next election.
   I would rather have expressed my views about the future of
Europe directly, and at a time of my own choosing. In particular I
deeply resent the journal's assertion that I associate present day
Germany with the aggression of the past. I do not hold that view.
   Nevertheless I believe that the proposal of the European
Commission for economic and monetary union in the Community would
be a disaster, both for Great Britain and for the wider Europe in
which I passionately believe. It would be heartless after fifty
years of subjugation, for the Community to exclude the nations of
Eastern Europe from participating in the European Single Market.
The opportunities must be open for the nations of the European free
trade area to join. All the nations of Europe should be free to
maintain their own political, economic and national identities,
while enjoying the benefits of a free and fair trade.
   Great benefit will come to all from the completion of the Single
Market free from internal barriers, subsidies and restrictions,
trading openly with the rest of the world. Nothing but harm will
come from trying to force them into the straight-jacket of a single
currency, with economic policy decided by people who are not
accountable to the electors and taxpayers. It would result in
economic domination by the country with the strongest currency in
the Community.
   I believe that the views which I have expressed in this letter
are very much in line with those of the Government. But I recognize
the difficulties which my failure to use more measured words have
caused and, in the circumstances, I think it would be best if I now
left the Government.
   It has been a privilege and honor for me to have served you for
the last eleven years. You have achieved so much. I wish to place
on record my admiration for the transformation in the fortunes and
self-confidence of our country which you have wrought. I will
continue to support you in your essential further work on the
nation's behalf over many years ahead.
   Yours ever,
   Nicholas.

   A forest fire that had been contained leaped fire lines and had
burned 2,000 acres as of Saturday, and hot, dry weather created a
danger that the blaze could continue to spread.
   Firefighters in southern California conquered a 7,000-acre brush
fire started by a teen-ager's model rocket, and authorities warned
that the boy's parents might get the bill.
   In Washington state, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Ron Dehart
said most of the 55 small lightning fires in remote areas of the
Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest had either been put out or
were under attack. They totaled less than 60 acres.
   In Wyoming, firefighters battled Yellowstone National Park's
12th small fire of the year.
   The Oregon fire, named Delicious, had been contained at 600
acres Friday but late afternoon wind carried embers across a fire
line and the flames spread quickly, said Doug Decker of the Oregon
Department of Forestry.
   There were 400 people on the fire lines Saturday, he said.
   Decker said no homes were in immediate danger from the fire
about six miles south of Sisters, but firefighters were keeping
their eyes on a ranch toward which the blaze was moving.
   The fire was touched off Tuesday night by lightning. After
smouldering for two days, it grew rapidly Thursday, moving through
brush and pine forests on private land northwest of Tumalo
Reservoir.
   Lightning storms last week started a total of 300 fires around
Oregon, said Jim Fisher of the Oregon Department of Forestry.
   In southern California's Orange County, some 700 firefighters
took advantage of high humidity and calm wind to surround the
7,000-acre fire Friday. About 150 firefighters remained Saturday to
douse hot spots, said fire department spokeswoman Maria Sobol.
   A 15-year-old boy was arrested for investigation of unlawful use
of a model rocket. It is illegal for a minor to use such rockets
without supervision, officials said.
   The cost of battling the blaze that began Thursday in Chino
Hills State Park, 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles, could exceed
$500,000, and the 15-year-old's parents may get the bill, said
Orange County fire Capt. Dan Young.
   ``The law does allow us to go for cost recovery,'' Young said.
``People have to recognize they can be accountable for these
actions.''

   An estimated 50 million abortions _ half of
them illegal _ are performed around the world each year and as many
as 200,000 women die from them, according to a study released
Saturday.
   The Worldwatch Institute said in its report that restrictions on
pregnancy termination don't curb abortion rates, they only cause
more deaths _ most of them in Third World countries.
   But a spokesman for the nation's leading anti-abortion group
denounced the report as a ``very polemic document'' lacking
independent research.
   ``It's a little propaganda booklet,'' said Douglas Johnson,
legislative director for National Right to Life.
   The Worldwatch Institute, an independent research group funded
by private foundations and United Nations organizations, said the
number of deaths from illegal abortions could be far higher than
its statistics show because many go unreported and accurate figures
from developing countries are difficult to obtain.
   ``A moral smoke screen effectively obscures the huge public
policy health, human rights and social costs of restrictive
abortion policies,'' said the study, entitled ``The Global Politics
of Abortion.''
   The author, Jodi L. Jacobson, said the best way to reduce the
number of abortions and related deaths is to make abortion a
legitimate family planning component ``instead of making it a
crime.''
   She said the rate of abortion has dropped quickest in countries
where legalized abortion has been included in family planning
programs.
   But Johnson disputed that, saying, ``all of the empirical
evidence is on the other side.''
   ``In every nation that's legalized abortion, you get a vastly
greater number of abortions. That's true in the United States,'' he
said, adding that the number of abortions in the U.S. have doubled
since 1974. A year earlier, the Supreme Court struck down state
laws making abortions illegal.
   The study said available data shows that in nations where
abortion is legal, pregnancy termination ranks fourth among the
types of birth control, after female sterilization, intrauterine
devices and oral contraceptives.
   It said in countries where contraception methods are inadequate
_ either because of supply, religious or informational reasons _
abortion in the most popular method of birth control.
   In developed nations, abortion rates tend to be higher among
teenagers and women aged 20 to 24 who want to delay childbearing
for various reasons, the report said.
   Abortion rates in most developing countries are highest among
married women with several children who have no means of preventing
additional, unwanted pregnancies, according to the study.
   Most women live in countries where blanket bans on abortion have
been eased. The study found that 75 percent of the worlds's
population is governed by laws that allow abortion on medical,
and@or social and economic grounds.
   Women with little or no access to abortion facilities are most
likely to live in Africa, Latin America or Moslem Asia, where they
also have least access to safe contraception, the study said.
   Johnson said the report advocates replacing illegal abortions
with legal ones, but in doing so, ``you're just changing the
complexion of the abortions.''
   Also he said, the report advocates use of abortion as a method
of birth control, which he said a majority of Americans oppose.

<HEAD>Clemson To Offer M.B.A. Program In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students in the Soviet Union will be able
to get a diploma that epitomizes capitalism _ the master of
business administration degree _ under a program Clemson University
is setting up in Moscow, officials said Saturday.
   Officials from Clemson and the Soviet education ministry plan to
sign an agreement Sunday calling for the school to develop am
M.B.A. program in Moscow.
   ``With the rapid changes both in the Soviet Union and Europe,
they feel they need M.B.A.'s who understand U.S.-style
management,'' said Ryan Amacher, dean of Clemson's College of
Commerce and Industry.
   ``We're excited to be the initial degree-making institution,''
he said Satuday. ``In 10 years we'd like to have 500 Clemson
M.B.A.'s in the Soviet Union.''
   The program could begin as early as next year, he said.
   The agreement calls for a new group called the Consortium of
Universities for International Business Studies, to develop,
finance and operate the Institute for International Business
Studies-Soviet Union. Clemson heads the group of universities.
   The consortium will provide faculty for an M.B.A. program and
also offer non-degree managerial training through the institute in
the Soviet Union.
   In addition, the consortium will encourage trade between the
United States and the Soviet Union and facilitate cultural and
academic exchanges between the two countries.
   ``This is just the opening of a door which could eventually lead
to a number of educational and research partnerships with the
Soviets,'' Amacher said.
   An international business group, called Investment Services,
will fund the program with money derived from business ventures
within the Soviet Union.
   Amacher said the Paris-based business group includes several
international corporations. The group wants U.S.-trained Soviet
business leaders who can help with the expansion of trade between
the Soviet Union and other countries, Amacher said.
   Plans call for the M.B.A. program to begin no later than 1992
with some prerequisite courses offered in the fall of 1991.
Professors would be selected by the consortium and would spend at
least one semester in Moscow.
   Clemson would benefit by having some of its professors and
students travel to Moscow for classes, Amacher said. However,
American students would make up no more than 20 percent of the
total enrollment, he said.
   The degree requirements will be identical to those of the M.B.A.
program in Clemson and all classes will be taught in English, he
said.
   Clemson organized the consortium after it became apparent the
university did not have enough faculty members to run the Moscow
program without hurting at home, Amacher said.
   Other universities in the consortium are Georgia, Florida State
and Mississippi State, and Amacher said it is hoped more will join.
The others also will have a chance to send students and faculty
members to Moscow and could eventually offer degree programs,
Amacher said.
   Most students will be able to complete the degree requirements
in two years, he said.

   A 90-year-old Swiss guide reached
the peak of the Matterhorn on Saturday, the anniversary of the
first ascent of the mountain 125 years ago.
   Ulrich Inderbinen, the oldest person ever known to scale the
distinctive pyramid-shaped summit, took nine hours to complete the
outward and return journey, said Zermatt resort director Amade
Perreg.
   Inderbinen last climbed the 14,776-foot, 9-inch peak in 1982 but
continues his work as a mountain guide on less tricky Alpine slopes
in this southern Swiss resort.
   ``Today, he is the oldest person ever to stand on the
Matterhorn,'' Perreg said. ``He's a phenomenon. It's unbelievable.''
   The weather was clear and sunny, and the temperature at the peak
was near freezing.
   After returning, Inderbinen said he had enjoyed the climb,
Peregg said.
   He did not publicize his ascent in advance and afterward steered
clear of crowds enjoying the anniversary celebrations.
   He could not be reached for comment by telephone because he
refuses to have one in the house he shares with his daughter.

<HEAD>Mohawk Violence Shows Widespread Indian Dissatisfaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outbreak of violence between Mohawk Indians
and police over a white man's golf course is rooted in a dispute
more than two centuries old and is symptomatic of rising native
disgruntlement across Canada.
   ``If you continue to push people to a limit and the federal
government continues to ignore their issues, yes they will
retaliate,'' said Matthew Coon-Come, grand chief of the James Bay
Cree Indians.
   For many Indians on Canadian reserves, life is a continuous
struggle against poverty, alcoholism, poor health services,
non-existent plumbing, primitive sewage disposal and poor drinking
water. Death by injury or poisoning is quadruple the rate for the
rest of Canada and life expectancy is nine years less than that of
a white Canadian.
   Many Indians on reserves want self-government, with the land and
resources to give them a viable economy and an opportunity to
improve their living conditions.
   ``The underlying issue (in the Mohawk dispute) is to try to
settle land claims,'' Coon-Come said. His Cree Indians are fighting
to stop further hydroelectric development in their vast northern
Quebec homeland. ``They have been pushed back to the wall.''
   Shooting broke out Wednesday when police moved in to remove a
roadblock set up by Mohawks at Oka, about 20 miles west of
Montreal. A police officer was shot to death in the confrontation,
but it is still unclear if he was shot by Indians or a fellow
police officer.
   The Mohawks had set up the roadblock to stop the municipality of
Oka from expanding a golf course to include land the Indians claim.
   Robert Mainville, a lawyer whose firm represents Indian bands
across Canada, blamed inaction by the federal government for the
violence.
   ``You have this little municipality dialoguing with natives
instead of the federal government, and some policeman has to get
killed over a nine-hole golf course,'' Mainville said.
   ``What is happening in Oka is only symptomatic,'' he said.
``There is no doubt in my mind that the native population has
undergone a major shift in philosophy and a major shift in
approach. Violence is going to be seen more and more as an
alternative, particularly among young people.
   ``There is a very, very deep sense of frustration among the
young Indians of Canada. Basically, they feel they are being
short-changed. They want action and they are not seeing any on the
part of the federal government.''
   There are about 450,000 registered Indians in Canada and 33,000
Eskimos. Their 2,234 reserves cover 6.4 million acres.
   A renewed sense of pride emerged for many last month when
Manitoba legislator Elijah Harper, a Cree Indian, helped defeat a
constitutional amendment that would have recognized Quebec as a
``distinct society.''
   Harper and other Indians said Canadian Indians also have a
distinct society, but they are not mentioned in the constitution.
Holding an eagle feather in his hand, Harper solemnly said ``no''
each time Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon tried to introduce the
measure into the provincial legislature for ratification.
   The measure failed when Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells refused
to bring it to a vote, but Harper's action helped contribute to its
defeat.
   ``For the first time, the native population saw they had a
chance to show real political muscle,'' Mainville said. ``It's the
only time they have ever had the opportunity to do that in Canada.''
   In Canada, as in the United States, Indians were regularly
pushed from their land by white settlers, and sometimes cheated out
of land in treaties and agreements with the government or business.
   Indian bands in Canada have filed dozens of land claims with
federal and provincial governments.
   As the Mohawks confronted civil authorities Oka, the Haida of
British Columbia protested what they said was a violation of their
fisheries management plan by several commercial sport fishing
lodges. And in the Northwest Territories, the Dene were considering
a proposed land agreement involving $500 million.

   Thousands of broadcast workers defied
a government warning and walked off the job Saturday to protest
legislation the opposition said would tighten the ruling party's
grip on the industry.
   The opposition said the bills will effectively allow the
government to control ownership of networks and censor programming
ahead of the 1991 national elections.
   Government officials denied any political motive for the
legislation and argued the industry must be reorganized to
introduce new programming, private stations and more channels.
   About 70 opposition lawmakers staged a sit-down protest at the
National Assembly after the government-sponsored bills passed in a
turbulent session marked by pushing and shouts of angry opposition
lawmakers.
   Dissidents and union leaders urged a campaign to topple the
government of President Roh Tae-woo, whose government they said
rammed the legislation through Parliament.
   More than 6,000 workers at the nation's radio and television
stations responded to the vote by walking off the job, but the
government warned it would not ``sit idly by.''
   In a joint statement, broadcast network unions urged a campaign
to dissolve the legislature and the governing party. ``The assembly
must be dissolved immediately because it lost the right to exist,''
it said.
   Union leaders planned a protest rally Monday.
   Roh's opponents said the government has been seeking
constitutional and political changes to prolong power since the
January merger of the governing party with two minor opposition
groups.
   Hundreds of riot police were deployed outside KBS, the largest
state-run network. In April, riot police stormed the network to end
a 19-day strike.
   News and other programs were shortened, canceled, or replaced
with old tapes. It was the first strike affecting all radio and
television stations.
   Workers also left their jobs at the smaller Christian Broadcast
Service network and the Catholic-run Pyonghwa Broadcasting Co.
   ``The government will not sit idly by if the current situation
grows worse and is thought to have a bad effect on the nation,''
said Information Minister Choe Byung-yul.
   Choe accused network unions of staging ``unjustifiable political
protests'' to protect their own interests.
   The bills were passed quickly Saturday. Opposition members
blocked the speaker from entering the assembly then and Vice
Speaker Kim Jae-kwang, surrounded by about 40 ruling legislators,
rushed to the speaker's podium and read a list of 26 bills for
passage in 30 seconds.
   `Is there any opposition?'' Kim asked. ``No,'' answered ruling
party lawmakers, drowning out the opposition, and effectively
passing the legislation.
   One lawmaker ran across tops of desks shouting ``Fraud!'' Other
opposition members pushed, shoved and scuffled with ruling party
lawmakers.
   South Korean media came under strict government control in 1980,
when former president Chun Doo-hwan closed private networks and
placed virtually all radio and television under state management.
   Roh succeeded Chun in 1988 and has introduced press freedom and
other reforms. Networks have aired news reports critical of the
government.

   Nowhere does the threat of the Zodiac gunman
loom larger than in the working-class neighborhood where the latest
in a long line of mad city criminals claimed his first three
victims.
   ``I worry about my husband. When he leaves, I wonder, `Will he
come back alive again?''' said Bernice Leach, who lives on the
street where the Zodiac gunman shot his second victim on March 29.
   The shootings have sparked the city's largest manhunt since the
search for ``Son of Sam'' serial killer David Berkowitz in the late
1970s. Despite the small number of victims, some New Yorkers are
genuinely worried about the killer in their midst and the
probability he will strike again.
   No neighborhood has felt the gunman's presence more keenly than
the adjoining areas of Woodhaven in the Queens borough and East New
York in Brooklyn, where the gunman struck three times in a
six-block stretch.
   Late-night travelers who use the subway are being met by
friends. Red-bereted Guardian Angels patrol the streets. People
call police if they see a stranger fitting Zodiac's description.
   A young man on crutches who gave his name only as Greg seemed
angry but resigned about the shootings. ``If he comes back, he
comes back. What are you going to do?'' he asked.
   Greg leaned on his crutches and looked behind him. ``People
ain't going to be sleeping on the dude no more. They're aware
now,'' he said.
   The Zodiac has preyed on the defenseless: two victims walked
with canes, one was inebriated, and the last was a homeless man
asleep on a Central Park bench.
   The Zodiac gunman has vowed in six letters sent to police and
news media that he will shoot 12 people _ one for each astrological
sign. The shooter, believed to be a male, has wounded three people
and killed one.
   The name he uses in his letters was taken from a killer who
plagued the San Francisco area about 20 years ago.
   A massive citywide dragnet, dubbed ``Operation Watchdog'' and
involving more than 200 detectives, failed to catch the gunman
early Thursday. Police had theorized that if the gunman followed
his deadly pattern, he would attack before dawn.
   Thursday was the 21st day since the Zodiac's last shooting.
Three of the shootings had been spaced 21 days apart; a fourth
shooting was 63 days apart from the others, a multiple of 21.
   Detectives also were checking the fingerprints of all newly
arrested crime suspects against a partial print found on the letter
he left in Central Park after his last attack, the New York Daily
News reported Saturday.
   So far, detectives have failed to match that fingerprint with
any prints filed in local and federal computer databanks.
   In the Woodhaven and East New York areas, dozens of detectives
patrolled in unmarked cars early Thursday, joined by anxious posses
of citizens. They all sought a suspect described as a black man in
his 30s with a mustache and a receding hairline.
   Chief Joseph Borrelli, who helped lead the ``Son of Sam''
investigation, seemed weary but determined after spending Thursday
night directing the dragnet.
   ``If you believe the psychologists, they always say serial
killers want to get caught,'' Borrelli said. ``I don't think he
wants to be caught. He might have read in the paper that we were
beefing up. We may have deterred him.''
   The chief added: ``Just because he's got no formal education
doesn't mean he's stupid.''

<HEAD>Man Who Got Stiffest Poaching Term Back in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who received the state's stiffest
sentence for stealing sea turtle eggs was back in jail Saturday,
after dropping a knapsack containing 127 eggs, authorities said.
   Alvin George Keel, 46, gave an alias when he was arrested
Friday, something he has done in the past to keep police from
linking him to turtle egg poaching cases, officials said.
   But an officer involved in Keel's arrest last year recognized
him after his latest arrest, spoiling the alias ruse.
   Keel was held on $500 bail Saturday on charges of disturbing
marine turtle eggs, resisting arrest without violence and
obstructing officers, said police officer Craig Gunkel.
   Gunkel said he expected the case to be turned over to the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, because of harsher sentences possible
under federal wildlife protection laws.
   A resident called police Friday to report she saw someone
digging in the beach sand in this tony resort town. When officers
tried to question Keel, he dropped the knapsack and ran, Gunkel
said.
   About 30 eggs spilled from the pack, and the officers gave
chase. After catching him, investigators found Keel's boot prints
around four disturbed turtle nests.
   Four state and local agencies last year charged Keel with 12
counts after arresting him four times for pilfering 582 eggs during
the 1989 nesting season, which runs from May through August.
   Keel, who authorities believe to be a major supplier for the
turtle egg black market, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year
in jail, a year on probation and a fine of $11,250.
   The eggs, considered by some to be aphrodisiacs, are laid at
night on the beaches of South Florida by several endangered species
of turtle.
   Sgt. Kenneth Parramore, of the state Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, said at the time he expected the jail term to keep Keel
behind bars for most of the 1990 nesting season. But Keel was
released from the Palm Beach County stockade May 23 after time off
for good behavior.
   ``I thought he was still in jail when they caught him,''
Parramore said on Saturday. ``The last two years, he seemed to be
the major player. He's been caught five times now in two summers.''

   A woman protesting a ban on skimpy
bathing suits was arrested Saturday when she stripped down to a
copy of the Bill of Rights.
   Tonianne Wyner, 43, was charged with disorderly conduct by
Florida Park Service officers after she refused to get dressed and
urged onlookers to disrobe, said Randy Lewis, a Department of
Natural Resources spokesman.
   ``She had told us she wanted to be arrested, so we accommodated
her,'' said Lewis.
   But Ms. Wyner said she didn't expect to be arrested.
   ``I expected that they would acknowledge that there is a First
Amendment, that the First Amendment is my permit to express myself
the way that I choose,'' she said.
   Lewis said the parchment Bill of Rights barely covered Ms.
Wyner's chest and abdomen.
   Ms. Wyner had led about a dozen nudists' rights demonstrators at
John D. McArthur State Park, who objected to a ban on thong-style
swimsuits and also spoke out against First Amendment abridgements.
   Free-speech debate recently has blossomed in Florida following
the arrests on obscenity charges of members of the 2 Live Crew
rap-music group over their lyrics, a crackdown on adult video
rentals and revised swimsuit rules.
   New limits on swimwear at state parks took effect Friday, just
as National Nude Weekend was about to get underway.
   The state regulations specifically prohibit G-string suits that
expose most of the wearer's buttocks. Lewis said no arrests had
been made yet.
   He also said that Ms. Wyner handled a small sea turtle during
the protest, but that officials couldn't find it after her arrest.
State law bars people from disturbing the protected marine turtles.
   Ms. Wyner was released at the park and cited to appear in Palm
Beach County court July 24.

<HEAD>Singh Resignation Throws India Into Political Confusion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with meeting between Singh, party

toll to seven; ADDS details; no pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh offered to
step down Saturday, saying he had lost the people's confidence, but
leaders of the governing party tried to persuade him to remain at
his post.
   Singh has been beset by party infighting, brought to a head by
the resignations of three Cabinet ministers on Friday and six
junior ministers on Saturday. They were protesting a power play
involving the deputy prime minister's efforts to maintain his
family's power in Haryana state.
   The issue has split Singh's Janata Dal party and highlighted the
feuds within the political alliance that ousted Rajiv Gandhi in
November elections.
   In his letter of resignation, Singh asked his Janata Dal party
to chose a new leader to replace him.
   He met the party's top leaders at his official residence late
into the night, but officials said the talks were ``inconclusive.''
Results of the meeting were not expected to be made public until
Sunday.
   As the talks extended past midnight, Jaipal Reddy, the party's
general secretary, said Singh had not yet retracted the resignation
letter he had sent to the party's president, Sommappa Rayappa
Bommai.
   Earlier, Bommai said he thought the resignation would be
rejected.
   ``The party is united. The government will continue,'' Bommai
said, before convening the late-night meeting between Singh and the
party's decision-making body.
   ``I hope _ I am confident _ there will be no occasion to elect a
new leader.''
   Singh, who took office seven months ago, said in his resignation
letter that he had lost the trust of the people and the parties
that make up his minority National Front coalition government.
   The opposition Congress Party dismissed the political crisis as
a fraud.
   ``Frankly, I think it's a hoax. If the prime minister really
wanted to resign he should have done the logical thing and gone to
the president of India,'' said Congress Party spokesman M.J. Akbar.
``It's a joke on the people of India.''
   Had Singh sent his letter of resignation to President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman, it could have opened the way for former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi of the Congress Party to form a new
government, or for elections.
   Critics charge that Singh's efforts to hold his party together
have diluted his efforts to tackle problems, such as rising food
and gasoline prices and separatist revolts by Sikhs in Punjab and
Moslems in Kashmir.
   Nearly 1,400 people have been killed by Sikh extremists this
year, including 11 on Saturday. Eight of those killed Saturday died
during a foiled attempt to assassinate a senior police officer,
United News of India news agency reported.
   Seven deaths in Kashmir on Saturday raised the toll there to 744
this year. Six of those killed Saturday died when troops found
their path blocked by a horsecart and opened fire on a jeering
crowd, witnesses said. Army sources said the troop convoy was
ambushed.
   When Singh's party ousted Gandhi in elections last year, it
campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket. The Congress Party has
been out of power only three years since India became independent
from Britain in 1947.
   Singh assembled a government based on a five-party minority
coalition that relied on the support of Communists and Hindu
right-wingers. The only common ground has been antipathy to the
Congress Party.
   The political crisis was precipitated when Deputy Prime Minister
Devi Lal, an entrenched political patriarch in his native state of
Haryana, reinstated his son Om Prakash Chautala as head of the
local government.
   Chautala was forced from office in May after 12 people died in
repeated electoral violence in his constituency. One victim was an
independent candidate for Chautala's seat.
   In his letter to Bommai, Singh said: ``The rationale of my being
in the office of the prime minister was the trust of the people, of
the members of the National Front and of the supporting parties.
   ``The developments of the last two days have shown that I have
lost this trust. The rationale of my remaining in office is no
longer there,'' the letter said.

<TEXT>
   About 30,000 years ago, an extinct cousin
of the pig was taking shelter in a cool cave when it slipped at the
mouth of a 20-foot pit and slid in.
   Indiana State Museum workers and volunteers this week followed
the pig and its mates into two muck-filled cavern rooms that are
yielding a trove of evidence of prehistoric life in southern
Indiana.
   Week-long ``pig digs'' over the last four years at Mengenity
Peccary Cave have unearthed bones of more than 100 examples of the
now-extinct pig, called the flat-headed peccary. It's the largest
early peccary find in North America.
   Sunday is the last day of the annual expedition into the cave to
root bones out of the sloppy cave floor. Mud has to be carefully
troweled from numbered, 20-inch squares, then washed over a screen
to separate out fragments of bone.
   The remains of other animals also have been found in the
primordial slime of the cave.
   ``It's probably the best single time line for Ice Age life in
Indiana,'' said Ron Richards, the museum's curator of paleobiology.
   ``It gives us sort of a history of life in southern Indiana over
the last 30,000 years,'' he said. ``Every 10 centimeters we dig in
one cave room takes us back into time as much as 900 years.''
   Richards didn't relish his week in the cave, however.
   ``For the most part, it's cold and damp,'' he said. Even when
the temperature outside nears 100 degrees, the temperature inside
seldom climbs above the upper 50s.
   They work by the light of kerosene lamps. A half-dozen people
can crowd into the largest room. A smaller one holds two or three.
   ``Everything you have on is permeated with moisture. We're
standing in a couple of inches of water with steam pouring off our
bodies,'' Richards said.
   The diggers have found the jaw of a dire wolf, now extinct, and
a piece of shell from an ancient tortoise. They've also found
evidence of arctic shrews, plains pocket gophers, and rodents
called yellow-cheeked vole.
   ``That shows that it was once a fair amount cooler here,'' he
said. ``And it shows that at different times there would have been
grasslands in Indiana, and prairie.''
   It will take the museum about a year to identify, preserve and
catalog what was found during the week in the cave. Some of them
will be displayed at the Indianapolis museum in February, Richards
said.
   The diggers believe the dire wolf jawbone found in this year's
painstaking work matches another piece of jawbone and a skull found
last year.
   ``You dig and dig until all of a sudden you hit bone, and you
start pecking around it little by little so you don't damage it,
but you don't know what you have,'' said Chip Bickley.
   ``Finally when you come through to the bone, it's all worth
it,'' said Bickley, who spends the rest of the year working on
state historic buildings.

<HEAD>Playwright Criticizes Government Art Guidelines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New government guidelines on art submitted for
funding through the National Endowment for the Arts are
preposterous and dangerous, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Edward Albee said Saturday.
   ``We are turning into a passive society that wishes to be
entertained, to be taken out of itself, to be fed easy truths,'' he
said. ``Simply because you are putting money into the arts doesn't
mean that you have the right to diminish the arts.''
   Bills to continue the NEA are pending in both the House and
Senate, and a fight is expected over several proposals to apply
provisions restricting federal subsidies from going to art that is
deemed obscene, sacrilegious or otherwise offensive.
   Albee, winner of several Pulitzer Prizes and author of ``Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' spoke to about 200 people at Carnegie
Mellon University's College of Fine Arts after accepting the
Carnegie Mellon Commitment to Playwriting Award.
   Albee said the atmosphere of the 1960s and the Kennedy
administration fostered creative expression.
   ``The government began pouring millions and hundreds of millions
of dollars into the arts through the National Endowment,'' he said.
``Artists were willing to live dangerously and go out on a limb.
   ``What is happening today is something we should worry about
more. Any art that is safe is dead. And any society that will not
participate in the danger of the arts is a society in great danger
of going down the drain.''

   Half of Americans think that federal regulators
are unfairly focusing on the involvement of the president's son in
the Silverado Savings and Loan case, according to a magazine poll.
   Newsweek also reports in its July 23 issue that 42 percent of
those asked don't think it's unfair for investigators to look into
Neil Bush's business dealings.
   The telephone poll, conducted by The Gallup Organization,
indicated that 70 percent of Americans think Neil Bush's
involvement is damaging his father, President Bush.
   Despite that, 72 percent of those surveyed said the president's
son should be able to engage in any business, including those that
receive federal loan guarantees or deal with the government.
   A large majority, 81 percent, think that the S&amp;L scandal should
be an important issue in the next presidential election, although
neither political party was clearly blamed for the scandal,
Newsweek said.
   Republicans were blamed for the scandal by 35 percent and 19
percent blamed the Democrats while 16 percent said both political
parties were to blame.
   Other findings in the poll were:
   _ 59 percent think the S&amp;L scandal is very serious.
   _ 72 percent oppose a special income tax surcharge to pay for
the S&amp;L bailout.
   Gallup polled 756 adults between on Thursday and Friday. The
margin of error is 4 percentage points.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government forces trying to protect
this besieged capital battled rebels Saturday with rocket-propelled
grenades, witnesses reported.
   The grenades fired by both sides flattened houses in
Paynesville, a suburb eight miles northeast of Monrovia, according
to reports from travelers to the area.
   Rebels began some of Saturday's fighting, but most clashes were
started by troops loyal to President Samuel Doe, the witnesses
said. He is trying to stall a drive against the capital by the
insurgent National Patriotic Front of Liberia.
   Diplomats said there had been no major gains by either side and
the military situation appeared to be static. The rebels encircled
the city after beginning their offensive from the far northeast
corner of this West African nation six months earlier.
   Diplomatic sources said there were persistent reports of
fighting between rival groups of rebels. The diplomats, speaking on
condition of anonymity, suggested this might have been one reason
for the delay in the assault on Monrovia.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor acknowledged a split as long ago as
May, saying one of the senior rebel leaders, Prince Johnson, had
summarily executed rebel commanders without trial.
   This besieged Atlantic coast capital, virtually cut off from the
outside world by land, sea and air, was again without power and
piped water supplies Saturday. A municipal generator that had been
shut down for a week restored electrical power from Friday evening
to Saturday morning and then shut down again.
   There was no explanation for the renewed outage, but the
generator was powered by diesel fuel, which is in short supply.
   Several aid groups, including the International Committee of the
Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and Catholic Relief Services,
have begun distributing rice to residents who have been eating
roots and leaves because of food shortages.
   The rice had been stored since June in warehouses where it was
deposited by the United Nations. U.N. staff members were pulled out
of Liberia after refugees housed in their compound were attacked by
some of Doe's troops.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said about eight masked
soldiers killed a guard and abducted about 30 people.
   One of the U.N. warehouses was looted by Doe's soldiers, but a
second was opened to the relief agencies. They distributed its
contents to the needy while the government provided protection.
   Checkpoints, created throughout the city as the government
defensive position has deteriorated, were more relaxed on Saturday.
Soldiers waved some travelers through without inspection.
   The guerrillas accuse Doe's government of corruption, tribalism
and suppressing the opposition. They have said they will lay down
their arms only after Doe leaves office.
   Negotiations in neighboring Sierra Leone have failed to end the
conflict.
   Doe took power in a 1980 coup that ousted elitist descendants of
American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.

   Showers and thunderstorms that generated at least one tornado
were scattered over the eastern half of the nation Saturday, and
locally heavy rain caused flooding in the Southwest.
   Temperatures plunged to record lows from Michigan to Texas.
   Many showers and thunderstorms had developed by early afternoon
from New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, western
Pennsylvania and western New York state southward across Georgia
and Florida.
   A tornado touched down around noon at Preston, Md., and a storm
that might have been a tornado caused damage during the morning at
New Port Richey, Fla., the National Weather Service said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.76 inches at Tampa, Fla.; 1.06 inches at Knoxville, Tenn.; and
1.06 inches at Mansfield, Ohio.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over central
Alabama, southern Mississippi, southern Arkansas, northern
Illinois, northeastern Iowa, western Lower Michigan and eastern
Wisconsin.
   Rain also was scattered from southern Nevada and western Arizona
across New Mexico, southwestern Texas and Colorado into the
Nebraska Panhandle.
   Locally heavy rain during the early morning along the arid lower
Colorado River Valley caused street flooding at Bullhead City,
Ariz., and near Needles, Calif., the weather service said, and left
an inch or two of water standing on roads between Lake Havasu and
Parker, Ariz.
   Heavy rain Friday over the headwaters of the Puerco River in New
Mexico caused high water along the river paralleling Interstate 40
in Arizona during the night.
   Record lows reported were 57 at Abilene, Texas; 51 at Amarillo,
Texas; 61 at Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; 63 at College Station,
Texas; 50 at Concordia, Kan.; 62 at Dallas-Fort Worth; 66 at Del

   The record lows at Amarillo, Houston, and Waco tied their
records for the whole month of July.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 42 at Kearney and
Ord, Neb.
   Hot air settled in California's southern San Joaquin Valley.
Bakersfield had already heated to 101 by 9:30 a.m.
   On Friday, the heat hit the San Francisco area, with highs of
106 at Morgan Hill and 103 at Livermore, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. experienced the highest demand for power in northern and

   A Baptist church founded in the
mountain wilderness 215 years ago will celebrate its anniversary
Sunday with a ``bear feast'' to honor the animal that helped keep
its founders alive.
   ``It wasn't easy for the settlers to bring cows, sheep and other
domestic animals across the Allegheny Mountains,'' said the Rev.
Joseph Gluck, pastor emeritus and historian of the Forks-of-Cheat
Baptist Church.
   ``That's why the black bear became one of the great sources of
meat for the people who founded our church,'' Gluck said. ``It was
a staple. We eat some every year as a sort of memorial. Besides,
it's a lot of fun.''
   The church, located on a hilltop overlooking the Cheat and
Monongahela rivers, has been serving bear meat at its annual picnic
off and on since the late 1700s, and each year over the last three
decades, Gluck said.
   The picnics mark the anniversary of the church's founding on
Nov. 5, 1775. The celebration is held in July because ``we like to
celebrate while the weather is nice,'' said Gluck, 75.
   ``Bear-eating is not a Johnny-come-lately thing at the Forks,''
said the Rev. Chuck Yoke, the church's pastor. ``The church
founders used native bear meat to stay alive in the winter.''
   Visitors and others eating bear for the first time are eligible
to become members of the World Bear Eaters' Association, said
Gluck, who has the title of ``Bear Master'' at the church.
   ``I say some magic special Indian words, tap them on the head
three times with the magic tooth taken from a West Virginia black
bear and give them a certificate so they can prove to people
they've actually eaten bear,'' Gluck said.
   ``Mostly, they just grin and eat it,'' said Gluck.
   The association's membership is approaching 1,500 members, with
representatives from at least 24 states and several foreign
countries, said Gluck.
   Hunters from the eastern counties of West Virginia provide the
hind quarters cooked for the feast. Gluck said meat from 2-year-old
bears is best, because ``Yearlings are too scrawny and meat from
older bears is tough.''
   Lena Nicholson, 90, has been cooking bear meat for the feast for
decades, and she said it's a daylong task. She cuts the bear
quarters into roasts, trims the meat and then boils it in water
three times.
   ``That bear meat is awful strong and greasy,'' said Nicholson.
``You have to cook it that much to get down to the good meat.''
   The meat is then put into a long pan ``with celery, apple and
onion all over it'' and put into the oven for several hours,
Nicholson said.
   ``I have to open all the windows and the door, the smell gets
pretty strong, said Nicholson. ``When it comes out, it has a little
bit of a beef taste, kind of like a cross between beef and pork.
   ``People seem to like it real well,'' said Nicholson. ``There's
never any left and I've never had anyone complain yet.''
   Gluck said he warns those eating bear for the first time that
they may notice themselves growling afterward.

<HEAD>DNA Expert: No Semen Links To Defendants</HEAD>

   The case against three teen-agers charged with
raping a jogger in Central Park has been greatly weakened by the
government's failure to link the suspects through DNA samples, a
defense lawyer said.
   An FBI expert testified Friday that semen samples taken from the
body and clothes of the victim, an investment banker, did not match
up in DNA testing with samples provided by the three defendants.
   The only sample that was linked to any of 15 people who
submitted to the DNA testing came from the jogger's shorts and
belonged to her boyfriend, said Special Agent Dwight Adams of the
FBI's DNA Analysis Unit in Dallas.
   The 15 who submitted sambles included the defendants, the
boyfriend and potential witnesses at the trial in criminal court.
   Semen samples taken from the jogger's cervix and her sock
matched each other, but did not match the samples of the
defendants, Adams testified. Other samples found at the scene were
too small to match, he said.
   ``It weakens the prosecution's case tremendously. It permits us
to argue our clients had nothing to do with the rape of the Central
Park jogger,'' said Peter Rivera, attorney for defendant Raymond
Santana.
   Prosecutors have said that to get a rape conviction, they don't
have to prove the defendants had sex with the jogger, only that
they helped other defendants rape her.
   DNA testing, done through bodily fluids, illuminates a genetic
fingerprint unique to each person.
   When the DNA tests in this case were first made public during
pretrial hearings, defense lawyers for the three teen-agers said
the results indicated an unidentified person had had sex with the
jogger.
   Prosecutors say the woman was gang-raped and beaten almost to
death, then left in a ravine near a popular park jogging route.
   Santana, 16, Antron McCray, 15, and Yusef Salaam, 16, are on
trial for attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault, robbery
and riot in the attack on the woman and two male joggers.
   The woman, now 30, survived and returned to work, but suffered
brain damage and has no memory of the attack.
   McCray, Santana and Salaam are on trial in an adult court, but
if convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders, to up to
10 years in prison.
   Three other youths are to stand trial on the same charges later
this year.

   Each year, 76-year-old Gudrun Hertsgaard does
what she can to reduce the national debt.
   This year, she wrote out a check for $300, leaving the balance
at roughly $3,000,000,000,000, give or take a few dozen billion.
   Hertsgaard sent her money to the U.S. Treasury through Citizens
for a Debt-Free America, a network of people who chip away at the
national debt a few dollars at a time.
   Just the interest on the debt this year will approach $200
billion, about 15 percent of the federal budget. Friends tell
Hertsgaard her annual gestures are futile, but she is undismayed.
   ``I tend to think small anyway,'' she said. ``I look at the
pennies. I try not to think of the millions and billions and
trillions.''
   Nationwide, 2,345 people contributed more than $4.2 million in
the past five years toward retiring the debt, including 29
Minnesotans who gave $26,301.
   Hertsgaard started sending money to the federal Bureau of the
Public Debt in 1986. ``I started with about $50, increasing every
year,'' she said. ``I would like to give more. It's more important
than anything.''
   After her first donation, she received a letter of thanks from
the government. ``Your donation and interest in the financial
affairs of our country is appreciated,'' states the letter signed
by Jo Ann M. Kidwell, section chief, Document Control and
Distribution Section, Accounting Control Branch, Bureau of the
Public Debt.
   ``Isn't that just like the government?'' Hertsgaard said.
   She encourages friends to help reduce the debt, but few do.
   ``I don't know if it's because they don't give much to charity
in the first place or they just don't believe in this.
   ``But the deficit is so serious,'' she said. ``It puts us at
such a disadvantage against other countries. We aren't top drawer
anymore.''
   She blames the deficits on a national lack of will.
   ``The defense stuff went way out of balance,'' she said. ``What
burns me the most is that they don't ever do much about waste. And
then when they do identify something that could be cut, somebody
sends up a howl and it doesn't get done.''
   Prompted by individual contributions, Congress established the
Public Debt Retirement Fund in 1961. Citizens for a Debt-Free
America, founded in 1983, is based in New Berlin, Wis.

<HEAD>Haiti's President Orders Arrest Of Returned Exile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
ordered the arrest of a former paramilitary leader whose return
from exile has worried pro-democracy forces. However, the leader
remained free Saturday.
   The provisional president also brushed aside calls for her
resignation for her handling of the issue. She indicated she would
not step down until elections set for Nov. 4.
   ``All of us Haitians must unite in order to hold elections that
will establish a definite government,'' Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said
in an address televised nationwide Friday night.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot is under pressure to arrest two former
officials who returned from self-imposed exile last week. The two
are believed to be in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
   Roger Lafontant, who headed the brutal paramilitary police known
as the Tonton Macoutes during the deposed Duvalier regime, returned
Saturday from the Dominican Republic. Lafontant was also a minister
of defense and interior.
   The other ex-official, William Regala, is a retired major
general who was in charge of security during the November 1987
elections. They were aborted after thugs supported by army soldiers
killed 34 voters at the polls.
   He returned from the United States on Tuesday.
   Their return has given rise to fears it would be impossible to
hold free and fair elections and widened a rift between the
president and the Council of State. The 19-member Council shares
power with the president and has veto power over her decisions.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a former Supreme Court judge, was
appointed provisional president in March after military ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril fled to the United States amid violent
demonstrations.
   A group of political leaders, including many Council members,
has given Mrs. Trouillot's government until Monday noon to arrest
the two officers. They have vowed to call for strikes and protests
to push for her ouster if the arrests are not made.
   ``We want her out. We don't trust her,'' said Max Bourjolly,
leader of the Communist Party. His party and seven others are
pressuring for her ouster.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot also is accused of appointing former
Duvalier government officials to the Cabinet without the approval
of the Council.
   On Saturday, the U.S. Embassy said a $10 million loan has been
approved for Haiti to buy essential imports, mainly petroleum.
   President Bush's administration has linked aid, which was cut
after the November 1987 election massacre, to free elections this
year.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said she had ordered police to arrest
Lafontant, but there was confusion Saturday as to whether the
warrant was legal. By late Saturday, there were no reports of his
arrest.
   A new warrant for Regala had not been issued.
   ``My conclusion is that police don't want to arrest Lafontant,''
said Bayard Vincent, the government prosecutor who issued the new
warrant for Lafontant. Two other warrants were issued last week but
were not served.
   Military men have ruled Haiti since Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier fled in 1986 to exile in France. He took power in 1971
upon the death of his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who
ruled Haiti since 1957.

   The Associated Press and its technical employees
reached a tentative agreement Saturday on a new three-year
contract, both sides announced.
   The package is now subject to ratification by the 310 members of
the Communications Workers of America.
   In the agreement the AP dropped its proposal for a deductible on
hospital bills. However, the new contract contains a ``managed
care'' system for the health plan that the AP had sought.
   Under the tentative accord, the weekly salaries of top-scale
technical workers would increase $23.50 the first year, $24 the
second and $24.50 in the third year to $636.50.
   ``We believe this is a good contract for both sides,'' said
Byron Yake, AP's director of Human Resources. ``Adding a third year
to the agreement provides everyone with more stability.''
   ``The negotiating committee is recommending acceptance of the
agreement,'' Ed Cotter, a member of the CWA bargaining committee,
said on a telephone hotline set up to inform members about the
talks.
   Last week the union announced that its membership had voted down
an earlier two-year contract offer.
   The new agreement includes increases in pension benefits and
geographic differentials in the third year.
   The new agreement would be retroactive to May 19 and expire May
18, 1993. The technical employees have been working under contract
extensions.

   A flash fire eight levels
below the deck of the USS Saratoga aircraft carrier injured three
civilian welders and a sailor Saturday, the Navy said.
   The men were replacing a pipe at about 2:30 p.m. when the fire
started, said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Hondo, a spokesman for the Naval
Air Force at the Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   ``One of the injured civilians and the Navy man suffered
second-degree flash burns and were flown by helicopter to area
hospitals. The other victims were taken by ambulance,'' Hondo said.
None of the injuries was life-threatening, he said.
   Damage to the ship docked at Mayport Naval Station was minimal
and the fire burned itself out almost immediately, said Capt. Barry
Dysart, executive officer of the Saratoga.
   ``There was no structural damage to the ship. It will have no
impact on our operations at all,'' Dysart said.
   Both the Navy and Atlantic Marine Inc., the welders'
Jacksonville employer, said they would investigate to determine the
cause of the fire.
   The Saratoga is based at Mayport and carries a crew of about
5,000 when fully staffed. It has been undergoing minor repairs
since returning in June from training operations along the Eastern
seaboard.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany arrived
Saturday for talks aimed at soothing the Kremlin's concerns about
German unification and winning approval for united German
membership in NATO.
   Earlier in the day, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and NATO
chief Manfred Woerner skirted the issue of the military allegiance
of a united Germany during talks, but Woerner expressed confidence
a solution could be found.
   Woerner, the Western alliance's highest-ranking official and
first NATO chief to visit the Kremlin, said Gorbachev accepted an
invitation to address the group at its Brussels headquarters. A
date has not been fixed.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said that at a meeting
between Woerner and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
both sides had agreed that the NATO chief's visit ``was a symbol
... that the Cold War has ended, and Europe is entering a new
period.''
   Shevardnadze later met Kohl at a Moscow airport, Tass said. Kohl
will hold talks with Gorbachev on Sunday in Stavropol, the Soviet
leader's home region.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters on
Friday that the visit was ``in support of progressing the
`two-plus-four' talks on the way to achieving a united Germany in
the Western alliance.''
   The questions of Germany's military and political obligations
are being worked out within the framework of ``two-plus-four''
talks among the two Germanys, the United States, France, Great
Britain and the Soviet Union.
   Woerner's visit to Moscow follows the July 5-6 summit by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in London, where alliance
leaders agreed on a new strategy and proposed a non-aggression
declaration to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``There is a clear coincidence in the approach set out by the
alliance in London and the views of the Soviet leadership,''
Woerner said. ``The hand of friendship has been extended on both
sides, and there is agreement on building a new relationship.''
   Woerner said he told Gorbachev and Shevardnadze that NATO sought
cooperation with the Soviet Union and that ``our alliance does not
look upon you as an adversary but as a future partner.''
   But Woerner, West German defense minister from 1982 until his
appointment to the top NATO job in 1988, said the issue of German
unity was not discussed.
   ``Since my Soviet partners didn't raise the issue, I didn't
raise it. But I would not draw any conclusion from that at this
very moment. The one which I have drawn is that I am confident we
will find a solution,'' he said.
   Woerner said he could understand Soviet fears about a united
Germany, given the horrifying experience of World War II.
   But he added, ``A membership of a united Germany in our alliance
would increase stability and would not be a threat of any kind to
the Soviet Union.'' Moscow will lose East Germany, a cornerstone of
the Warsaw Pact, once the German states merge. It has opposed a
united Germany's membership in NATO.
   Kohl has said he would like the ``two-plus-four'' talks to be
wrapped up in time for all-German elections in December.
   Other hurdles remain, however, including the size of the future
German army.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Saturday the Soviet Union would receive a ``binding'' promise on
the ceiling for the size of a united German armed forces.
   Genscher, addressing a meeting of his Free Democratic Party in
Zerbst, East Germany, did not specify any figure.
   The combined armed forces of the two Germanys now number about
600,000, with West Germany alone having 480,000 troops.
   Genscher made his remarks shortly before he left for Moscow to
accompany Kohl.
   West German officials have said that Kohl will not offer Moscow
any more money beyond the already promised $3 billion in
government-guaranteed bank loans announced last month to help the
Soviet economy shift to a free-market system.
   At last week's summit in Houston, leaders of the seven major
industrial democracies failed to establish a unified approach on
the Soviet aid issue. They instead agreed to establish a joint task
force which would make non-binding recommendations by the end of
the year.
   West Germany has led the way in offering economic assistance to
the Soviets, apparently in an effort to gain Moscow's acceptace of
rapid German unification.

   Nelson Mandela said Saturday that he and
South African President F.W. de Klerk agree a settlement is
urgently needed to end white minority rule in their nation.
   The 71-year-old deputy president of the African National
Congress made the comments at a news conference at the end of a
three-day visit to Kenya.
   ``There is an understanding that the longer we delay with a
settlement, the more damage will be done to the country,'' Mandela
said.
   Mandela, who arrived Wednesday accompanied by his wife, Winnie,
spoke before leaving for Mozambique, the last stop on a six-week of
tour of Africa, Europe and North America.
   Thousands of people welcomed Mandela at the airport in Maputo,
the Mozambican capital, where he was greeted by President Joaquim
Chissano.
   Children gave him flower garlands during the welcoming ceremony
before the Mandelas left by motorcade for the city center.
   Mandela is due to return to Johannesburg on Tuesday, one day
before his 72nd birthday.
   At his Nairobi news conference, Mandela said the ANC and
government would resume negotiations immediately after his return.
The ANC is the leading group fighting white rule.
   ``Both parties involved are keen on a settlement,'' Mandela said.
   He said the ANC was prepared to deal with threats by white
right-wing groups opposed to the abolition of the apartheid policy
of racial discrimination.
   ``But it is not for us here to discuss what we propose doing
about that threat,'' Mandela said. ``But naturally it is a matter
that involves priority in our thinking, in our strategy.''
   Mandela described ``as genuine, but unfounded'' the fear by some
white South Africans that they would be dominated by blacks when
majority rule came to the country.
   ``Our policy makes it clear that we will not tolerate any form
of racialism no matter who practices it,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela refused to discuss the Kenya government's recent attack
on supporters of multiparty politics.
   Six prominent Kenyans have been detained without charge in the
crackdown, and at least 28 people were killed in four days of riots
that began after police used gunfire and tear gas to break up a
pro-democracy rally.
   Armed riot troops patrolled the city Saturday, apparently
bracing for a possible repeat of last week's violence.
   Mandela also refused comment on an open letter from the wives of
seven prominent Kenyan supporters of multiparty politics who either
have been detained, are in hiding or have fled the country to avoid
arrest.
   ``We are not keen to be involved in the internal affairs of
Kenya,'' Mandela said. ``It is up to the people of Kenya to decide
their own affairs.''
   The wives had asked Mandela to intervene with Moi on their
behalf and secure their husbands' freedom.
   Mandela looked well after reportedly suffering a slight case of
pneumonia and cutting short the Ethiopian leg of his trip Wednesday
to seek rest and treatment in Kenya.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of current and former mental asylum
patients from across the nation marched and sang Saturday in a
protest against discrimination and inhumane treatment of the
mentally ill.
   ``The consumer rights movement for mental health is the last
civil rights movement,'' said Susan Buchsbaum, 31, of Stamford,
Conn. ``This movement is about bringing us into the community and
giving us a choice about how we want to live and what treatment we
want.''
   The march marked the end of a five-day convention on psychiatric
treatment attended by about 1,000 current and former mental
patients and their advocates, whose goals include erasing a
perceived stigma associated with psychiatric treatment and
advancing a nationwide civil rights movement for mental patients.
   ``We're declaring that we will not take abuse any longer _
forced drugging, shock treatments that rob you of your power,''
said Caroline Hailer, 25, of Charleston, W.Va. ``We're just as good
as anybody else.''
   Convention organizers said Saturday was declared National Mental
Patients' Rights Day because it fell on Bastille Day, the day the
French jail was stormed in 1789 and its inmates _ including a few
mental patients _ were freed.
   Convention delegates, some on leave from hospitals, paraded
nearly a mile through downtown chanting, ``Tear down the walls''
and waving signs with slogans like, ``Label Jars, Not People.''
   Ms. Buchsbaum, an X-ray technician, said she began fighting for
the rights of mental patients after undergoing hospital treatment
for depression and a panic disorder as a graduate student.
   ``I was tied down for three days at a time, injected against my
will,'' she said. ``They wouldn't let me talk to my parents.''
   Ms. Buchsbaum said she recovered but still battles stereotypes
and ``the stigma of having a psychiatric label.''
   ``People think we're a bunch of raving maniacs ready to shoot 10
people from the top of a building. That's just not true,'' Ms.
Buchsbaum said. ``Most mental patients are outstanding members of
society.''
   ``We are an oppressed people,'' Gilberto Romero, a Santa Fe,
N.m., mental-health advocate told a rally. ``We suffer from
discrimination, from prejudice, from disenfranchisement and from
stigma.''

   Syrian President Hafez Assad arrived
Saturday for his first visit in more than 13 years, making another
step in his rapprochement with Egypt.
   The three-day visit was Assad's fourth summit this year with
President Hosni Mubarak. Their two countries resumed diplomatic
ties in December.
   Saturday's visit came amid indications of intensified efforts by
Mubarak to patch up Syrian rifts with Iraq and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The two quarrels and Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war are the
most burning issues in inter-Arab relations. Syrian troops,
originally sent as Arab peacekeepers, now control most of Lebanon.
   Mubarak and Assad embraced and kissed after the Syrian leader's
plane landed at el-Nuzha Airport on the southern outskirts of
Alexandria, Egypt's second largest city.
   Assad and Mubarak conferred for three hours immediately after
they drove from the airport to Ras el-Tin Palace, where the Syrian
leader is staying.
   Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told reporters
that the two leaders discussed Arab problems and Egyptian-Syrian
relations. He gave no details.
   The two leaders held a second round of talks in the evening.
   Then Mubarak hosted a state dinner for Assad and his delegation.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, meanwhile, phoned the two
presidents from Tripoli to wish them success, the state-run Middle
East News Agency said. It gave no further details.
   Syria severed ties with Egypt in December 1977, weeks after
Egypt's then-President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem in a peace
drive that led to the signing of a treaty with Israel in 1979.
   Syria was the last of 16 Arab states to restore diplomatic ties
with Egypt after more than a decade of ostracism.

   About 250 supporters of the logging
industry rallied and marched Saturday in opposition to a November
ballot initiative that would limit the California timber harvest.
   The group, called Mothers' Watch, gathered at a local baseball
park and marched half a mile to the Northcoast Environmental
Center, a meeting place for organizers of the ``Redwood Summer'' _
a series of anti-logging protests.
   About a hundred counter-demonstrators, many of them members of
the Earth First! environmental group, appeared at the rallies,
which were peaceful.
   Mothers' Watch leader Candice Boak said her group was ``sick and
tired of distorted and false publicity produced by unqualified
obstructionists which makes it seem as if we want to cut down the
last old-growth redwood up here.''
   Boak's organization includes relatives of loggers, truckers and
wood processers, she said.
   Boak called for a boycott of 70 businesses she said support
Earth First! and urged voters to reject Proposition 130, a measure
to provide $742 million for the state to acquire and protect
old-growth forests and limit logging.

<HEAD>Two Killed, 10 Hurt in South African Hotel Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Explosions Saturday shook two
hotels in the Johannesburg area, killing two people and injuring
10, police said. They were investigating whether the blasts were
acts of terrorism.
   One explosion late Saturday at a hotel in Roodeport, northwest
of Johannesburg, killed one person and injured 10, police said.
   They said witnesses reported seeing someone role an object that
looked like a hand grenade into the hotel bar just before the
explosion. There were no further details available immediately.
   Before dawn Saturday, a hotel frequented mostly by whites was
bombed in Florida, another Johannesburg suburb. A black waiter was
killed.
   Commercial explosives, which have been associated with
right-wing white extremists, were used in that bombing. Damage was
minor.
   No one claimed responsibility for either bombing, but police
said they were investigating the attacks as terrorism acts.
   Right-wing whites issuing statements from hiding have claimed
responsibility for a recent spate of bombings aimed at blacks and
whites who oppose apartheid.
   But the explosion at the Will Smith Hotel in Florida did not
appear to fit the pattern.
   Florida is a middle-class and working-class area. Most whites
there tend to be relatively conservative.
   At the time of that blast, there were about 130 patrons at the
bar, all of them white, said Rod Rodrigues, one of the hotel owners.
   In another development, police said there was an explosion
Saturday morning at the suburban Johannesburg home of a right-wing
white, Hans Binneman. No one was injured, police added.
   The independent South African Press Association said Binneman
was a member of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement. It
quoted police as saying he was recently was detained for
questioning about earlier bombings in Johannesburg.
   Police say they suspect right-wing whites in the recent attacks,
and nine have been detained for questioning. No one has been
charged.
   Right-wing whites have vowed to resist President F.W. de Klerk's
plans to dismantle apartheid and share power with the 30-million
black majority.
   The African National Congress, the leading black opposition
group, supports a guerrilla campaign against the government. But it
has ended major attacks in the past year.

   France showed off the nation's military strength in
a Bastille Day parade Saturday, and President Francois Mitterrand
pledged to keep the nation's nuclear force independent and strong.
   Later in the day, flamboyant showman Jean-Michel Jarre lit up
western Paris before more than 2 million people in a spectacular
music and light show.
   Earlier, 7,000 servicemen trooped down the Champs-Elysee to
celebrate the start of the French Revolution.
   In his remarks, Mitterrand told television journalists,
``Defense is part of the imperial obligations of the nation.''
   ``I absolutely don't want to reduce it,'' he said, ``even more
so because there hasn't been a real reduction in the nuclear
potential of the United States or the Soviet Union.''
   France refuses to endorse the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's recent change of doctrine making nuclear weapons a
``last resort'' in any conflict with the Warsaw Pact. French
officials have said flexibility is a key to nuclear deterrence.
   ``The international situation has changed, tensions have
diminished. The duty of vigilance by the army, however, hasn't
diminished,'' Mitterrand said.
   July 14 marks the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789. The event
sparked the French revolution that toppled Louis XVI and gave
France its first republican government.
   The daylong festivities were capped by Jarre's extravaganza.
   During his show, the year-old Grande Arche and adjacent
skyscrapers in the financial district of La Defense were bathed in
dazzling, swirling colors. They changed in rhythm to Jarre's
symphonic rock music, while searchlights and fireworks formed a
canopy overhead.
   People packed the banks of the Seine on the capital's western
edge and a two-mile stretch of avenue to the Arc de Triomphe.
   The crowd was estimated at 1.5 million before the concert began,
but hundreds of thousands more people, from toddlers to nuns, kept
filling distant streets as it started. Many were unable to get a
direct view, but video screens were set up as well.
   The Culture Ministry underwrote the show with $8.18 million to
allow Jarre to put it on for free.
   ``I want a celebration for the people _ open and free to
everybody,'' said Jarre.
   The morning parade featured 7,000 soldiers, sailors,
firefighters and police officers marching from the Arc de Triomphe
to the Place de la Concorde to salute Mitterrand.
   A trio of aerobatic jets led off the parade, laying down blue,
white and red contrails over the route to match the colors of the
huge tricolor fluttering under the Arc de Triomphe.
   About 600 tanks and other armored vehicles lined the avenue or
paraded noisily along the three-quarter mile route. The vehicles
represent about 15 percent of France's armored forces.
   The loudest applause was reserved for the bearded companies of
Foreign Legionnaires, dressed in desert khakis and their trademark
white kepis.
   The Napoleonic-uniformed Republican Guards, who provide
ceremonial security at the presidential palace, also drew cheers as
they trotted down the Champs-Elysees on cavalry horses, flashing
their gleaming chrome sabers.
   Also featured were state-of-the-art Mistral ground-to-air
missiles, capable of reaching speeds of 1,864 mph to knock down
enemy aircraft.
   A platoon of World War II-era tanks, similar to those that
liberated Paris from the Nazi occupation 50 years ago, also were on
display. One bore the name De Gaulle, in tribute to wartime leader
Gen. Charles de Gaulle. France is celebrating the 100th anniversary
of his birth this year.

   Workers erected metal scaffolding Saturday to
shore up a subway tunnel that partially caved in during a blazing
hot fire and was threatening the collapse of a stretch of downtown
freeway.
   The 1{-mile stretch of the Hollywood Freeway was closed for a
second day because of fears it would collapse under the vibrations
of cars and trucks.
   A 100-foot section of a Metro Rail Red Line subway tunnel
adjacent to the freeway collapsed Friday when fire raced through
construction materials inside it.
   The subway line is part of a 150-mile rail grid planned for Los
Angeles. Mayor Tom Bradley on Saturday inaugurated the first
stretch of the system, a 22-mile electric commuter train line
beteeen downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach.
   The tunnel blaze broke out shortly before 2 a.m. Friday and
portions still smoldered Saturday afternoon.
   The cause remained unknown, but deputy Fire Chief Ray Rojo said
there were no indications of arson. Six workers in a nearby tunnel
smelled smoke when the fire broke out and escaped unharmed. Damage
was put at $5 million.
   About 250 feet of the tunnel runs under the freeway, which is
part of U.S. Highway 101. The portion under the freeway is
surrounded by an 8-foot-thick band of chemically treated concrete
or grout; the failed portion was not. Officials said that made all
the difference: the cave-in stopped just 10 feet from the freeway.
   ``The chemical grout prevented a cave-in,'' said Dave Roper,
deputy district operations director with the California Department
of Transportation. ``The one area that wasn't chemically grouted
collapsed. That tells us something.''
   Traffic chaos reigned on Friday, and authorities hoped to have
the freeway open for the Monday commute. About 250,000 vehicles use
the route daily.
   The contractor did not use grout on the section that collapsed
because it was topped by vacant land, Roper said. In the collapsed
portions, the blaze ate away wood supports and about 16 feet of
earth and metal framing tumbled down.
   Timbers that were part of the tunnel support system continued to
smolder Saturday as firefighters let embers burn themselves out.
The tunnel's metal ribs stayed intact but some twisted from the
intense heat of the blaze, which hit 1,500 degrees.
   Despite the fire, the $1.3 billion, 4-mile Metro Rail system,
which is 18 months behind schedule, will open as planned in
September 1993, said Al Perdon, assistant general manager for
Southern California Rapid Transit District.
   The damaged tunnel is only a spur, not the main tube that will
transport passengers in trains, official said. Even if the damaged
tunnel isn't fixed in time, a parallel tunnel can be used
temporarily in its place, Perdon said.

<HEAD>Zulu Party Lets in Whites to Rival Mandela's Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ULUNDI, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Zulu political organization
Inkatha opened its doors to whites Saturday as it pressed its
campaign to rival Nelson Mandela's group as a leader in the fight
against white rule.
   The announcement came at the party's congress in the capital of
the KwaZulu homeland, Ulundi. Some whites joined the blacks at the
event.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of both Inkatha and the Zulu
homeland, announced that Inkatha would participate as a multiracial
party in elections he hopes will take place before a new
constitution is negotiated to end apartheid.
   President F.W. de Klerk is negotiating to give the country's
black majority a say in the political system.
   Inkatha's chief rival is the African National Congress, whose
leaders include Mandela. There are some whites in the ANC
leadership, most notably Joe Slovo, the head of the South African
Communist Party.
   Supporters of the ANC and Inkatha have been fighting for power
in KwaZulu and Natal province since 1985, leaving more than 4,000
people dead.
   Both Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid but differ over plans
for a future South Africa. Inkatha is relatively conservative and
contends the ANC is unjustly trying to claim the role of principla
negotiator for the black majority.
   Buthelezi referred to the rivalry with the ANC in his speech to
the party congress.
   ``We will just not allow the ANC and its South African Communist
Party partner to crush all opposition to it and emerge as the only
viable political party,'' Buthelezi said.
   ``Nothing that the ANC can do will shake Inkatha's resolve to
come out as a new Inkatha and a political party to claim its
rightful place at the negotiating table,'' he said.
   The party congress adopted a platform calling for multiparty
democracy, peace and reconciliation, education for all South
Africans, equality before the law, respect for cultural heritage,
and wealth creation to help the underprivileged.
   Inkatha was formed in 1975 to organize Zulus against attempts by
the South African government to turn the KwaZulu homeland into an
independent state.
   Buthelezi and his organization successfully resisted the policy,
which would have stripped Zulus of their South African citizenship.
Inkatha became the dominant political party in the Zulu areas and
runs the homeland's semi-autonomous government.
   The organization claims 1.5 million members. Buthelezi has
described it in the past as a cultural liberation movement, but it
began admitting non-Zulus in 1979.

   A Japanese company will likely face a $43
million penalty for keeping double books to avoid paying union
wages to the Filipino crew of a logging ship, a federal judge said.
   An award that size would be the largest wage judgment in
maritime history, said Richard Dodson, a lawyer from Louisiana who
represented the 21 crew members in U.S. District Court.
   A defense lawyer said Saturday the shipping company would appeal
the judge's expected decision in favor of the plaintiffs.
   Delica Shipping company officials said the company kept two sets
of books on all 10 of the company's ships for the past eight years.
Pine Forest, the company ship involved in the lawsuit, was seized
in Tacoma in January and released only after the owner posted a $19
million bond.
   ``They admitted they cheated,'' Dodson said Friday.
   Both sides agreed that crew members were required to sign two
sets of monthly wage receipts, one indicating payment according to
levels specified in agreements with the International Transport
Workers Federation and another showing the actual pay rate.
   Forest Pine crew members said they were paid one-fifth the
contractual rate after being hired in March 1989. When 13 of the
crew asked to leave the ship to pursue wage claims, they were
blacklisted from future work, testimony indicated.
   Company lawyers argued unsuccessfully that Judge Jack Tanner
lacked jurisdiction because no cargo was unloaded in western
Washington state.
   Under U.S. law, the courts have jurisdiction over wage cases
involving foreign ships and crews when their voyages end in U.S.
waters.
   Defense attorney Joseph Stacey said Saturday that Delica would
appeal Tanner's expected decision against the company.
   Stacey said the crewmen were paid about 70 percent of union
scale wages, not the 20 percent alleged. He said the case covered
about 15 different pay grades and that he could not state actual
wage amounts.
   Stacey earlier said the crew members knowingly and voluntarily
agreed to less pay than required under the union agreement and that
what they did receive was still a highly desirable rate for the
Philippines.
   ``The flag-of-convenience vessels have never paid these ITF
wages,'' he said. ``In our case, even the ITF never expected
anybody to receive ITF wages.''
   In a hearing Friday, Dodson asked Tanner to award $150,000 in
back pay, $16 million in compensatory and penalty wages and $27
million in punitive damages from Delica.
   ``I might as well tell you, you're looking at a judgment near or
around that figure,'' Tanner told company lawyers. ``This case
cries out for punitive damages in a substantial amount of money,
both to punish your client and to deter others from such
outrageous, malicious and intentional conduct.''
   The judge's decision was expected later this summer.
   The Pine Forest is registered to Delica, a Panamanian
corporation. It flies the flag of Vanuatu, a small Pacific island
nation, and is operated by Inui Steamship Co. of Japan, a
subsidiary of Mitsui Inc.
   The ship is chartered by yet another Japanese company to bring
logs from the Weyerhaeuser Co. through Tacoma and Longview.
   Dodson said the double bookkeeping system boosted profits by
$400,000 a year.
   He said he had filed a $100 million civil suit against Delica on
behalf of 2,000 other crew members. Another Delica ship, the Fir
Grove, also is the subject of a civil case after being seized in
Coos Bay, Ore.
   The Pine Forest case was hailed Friday by Paul Chapman, director
of the Center for Seafarers' Rights at the Seamen's Church
Institute in New York.
   ``This case represents a systemic problem that is rampant
throughout the shipping industry around the world,'' Chapman said.
``Each year thousands of seafarers are cheated out of their earned
wages and are virtually blackmailed into signing false wage
receipts and unfair contracts.''

   Connie Chung got a little miffed Saturday
while being barraged with questions about the glitz factor of her
newly redone interview show on CBS.
   ``You people are so insulting,'' she told a roomful of
television critics at the Century Plaza hotel.
   The reporters were grilling her about the news value of ``Face
to Face with Connie Chung,'' formerly ``Saturday Night with Connie
Chung,'' which moves with its new name to Mondays at 10 p.m. on
July 23.
   Chung, who also anchors the Sunday CBS evening news, insisted
that celebrity interviews were not the driving force of her
hourlong program, despite recent network promotions that accentuate
her starside chats.
   The television critics insisted otherwise.
   ``Look, it's a magazine program,'' Chung said, her voice rising.
``We're going to have all kinds of stories.''
   Chung's press conference was part of the annual CBS summer media
tour for TV critics.
   Chung's infamous interview last winter with an uncooperative
Marlon Brando was ``an excruciating experience for me,'' she said.
``He toyed with me. He played with me. I think he wanted to direct
me.''
   The move from Saturday nights to Mondays allows Chung to follow
``Murphy Brown'' and ``Designing Women,'' two of the top-rated
programs on CBS.
   Chung said she hoped the switch would boost her ratings, which
never pushed into the high numbers on Saturday, an unpopular night
for most television networks.
   Chung also said she has never been approached to co-anchor the
weekly evening news with Dan Rather, despite persistent rumors the
network is considering such a move to revive Rather's sagging
Nielsen figures.

   The government Saturday said it was
helping about 190,000 refugees return to the south, where they had
fled famine and civil war.
   However, it denied a U.S. newspaper report that the refugees
were being forced to return to their villages in southwestern Bahr
el-Ghazal province.
   In its report Friday, the New York Times quoted village chiefs
and U.N. relief workers who said the government was making the
refugees go home and further straining food supplies in the region.
   The article quoted a report by the U.N. Children's Fund, which
said the refugees were taken by train and truck for part of the
route. It said they then had to walk as many as four days to their
villages.
   Brig. Gen. Pio Yukwan Deng, a member of the ruling military
council, dismissed the Times report as ``sheer, unfounded
allegations.''
   During the 7-year-old civil war in the south, about 2 million
refugees have fled the fighting and famine, settling in shantytowns
around the capital, Khartoum.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled to other Sudanese
cities as well as to neighboring Ethiopia and Uganda.
   Peter Orat, the minister for relief and displaced persons,
denied that any southerners were being coerced into leaving the
capital.
   ``Our declared policy is to help the displaced return to the
south, not by force but by their own free will,'' Orat said.
   He said those who wished to remain in the north would not be
allowed to stay in their shantytowns but would be moved to nearby
``production areas to help boost production.'' He did not
elaborate, but apparently was referring to agricultural areas.
   The refugees live in about 27 shantytowns around the capital and
in the nearby central region. About 10,000 inhabitants of one camp
in a suburban industrial area near Khartoum have already been moved
to another suburb because the camp's water was polluted.
   Mohamed el-Hassan Awad el-Karim, the commissioner for displaced
people, said that about 190,000 refugees had asked to return to
their homes in Bahr el-Ghazal.
   ``We are currently contacting concerned bodies, local and
international, to help us in transporting them,'' el-Karim said. He
said it was not possible for the government to transport all the
refugees.
   ``We are providing food for three months in addition to tents,
blankets, drugs and agricultural tools to anyone wishing to return
home.''
   The arrival of large numbers of war refugees in Khartoum and
other Sudanese cities has created tensions with local residents who
resent having to share their already meager food resources and job
opportunities.
   There are also tribal and religious differences.
   The southerners are mostly Christians or animists of African
origin. The northerners are predominantly Moslem of Arab descent.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms against
the government in 1983, demanding more autonomy and a greater share
in the country's economic wealth.
   Government troops killed 160 rebels in fighting this week around
the towns of Yei and Maridi in the southern Equatoria region, Brig.
Gen. Dominique Kassiano, a member of the ruling military council,
said Saturday. He did not mention government casualties.
   Western relief agencies say that in 1988 alone, more than
500,000 southerners were killed in the fighting or starved to death.
   For the past two years, the government had prevented the
southern refugees from returning home, fearing that they would
provide new recruits for the rebel army, the Times reported.
   The Times article said some relief workers believed that by
sending the refugees back, the military government was trying to
strain food supplies and disrupt life in rebel-held areas in the
south.
   The military government is led by Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, who took power in a June 30, 1989 coup that overthrew
the civilian Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi.

   It's back to the future for smoggy,
traffic-choked Los Angeles, where electric trolleys rolled again
Saturday for the first time in 30 years.
   ``Thirty years after the last Red Car served this community,
today we launch the beginning of the new Blue Line,'' declared
Mayor Tom Bradley in a ceremony at the light-rail mass transit
line's downtown Pico Station.
   The 22-mile, $877 million Metro Blue Line runs along an old
Pacific Electric Red Car route from downtown to Long Beach. It is
the first operating segment of a 150-mile, $10 billion rail grid
planned for completion in the next century.
   President Bush sent a message saying the construction
``demonstrated civic co-operation ... and the kind of local
commitment necessary.''
   Less than a mile away from the inauguration site, workers
erected metal scaffolding to shore up a subway tunnel that
partially caved in during a fire that began Friday and was
threatening the collapse of a stretch of the busy Hollywood Freeway.
   The tunnel is part of the 4-mile Metro Rail subway system, a
section of the rail grid scheduled to open in 1993.
   The Blue Line, completed in five years, is an overhead-powered
trolley system financed by a half-cent county sales tax voters
approved in 1980.
   The old Red Car system was built 90 years ago and dismantled in
1961 in favor of cars, buses and freeways. That decision also
produced some of the worst air pollution in the nation and chronic
traffic congestion.
   ``When 12,000 passengers (per day) ride this Blue Line next
year, it will reduce smog problems,'' said Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy.
   Cheers went up as the politicians clanged a silver bell and one
of the red, white and blue $1 million trolleys rounded a bend
sounding its horn.
   ``I was 8 years old when the Red Car stopped running,'' said
Corey Smith, a security guard waiting to take a trolley to work at
the Long Beach Transit Plaza. ``I have good memories. My
grandfather worked as a motorman.''
   Smith, who collects Red Car memorabilia, believes the Blue Line
will be a success.
   ``I'm going to take it on a regular basis,'' he said. ``It will
take a while for some people to get used to it, but once used to it
they will probably leave their cars.''
   After the civic leaders and reporters headed south down the line
for ceremonies at some of the other 21 stations, the Blue Line
began offering free rides for the weekend. A $1.10 fare goes into
effect Monday.
   Eric Jacobson, 35, waited in the 90-degree heat to be among the
first to ride. His father had taken him on the last Red Line
commute in 1961.
   ``It was the end of meaningful mass transit,'' he said. ``Now
we've come to our senses a little bit. Hopefully this is the start
of a viable mass transit system in the L.A. area.''
   As the Blue Line began operating, the Hollywood Freeway remained
closed for a second day near downtown because of the tunnel fire.
   The morning rush-hour traffic jam Friday illustrated the freeway
system's vulnerability to a single incident and the lack of mass
transit alternatives.
   A dozen Guardian Angels, the self-styled community crime
fighters, stood by in their red berets for the Blue Line's debut. A
familiar sight on transit lines in the East, they came from San
Francisco and San Jose to ride the Los Angeles trolleys.
   ``The general game plan is to ride from 5 p.m. until it shuts
down. That's when most crimes are committed. We'll be a visual
deterrent,'' said Trey Scharlin, who is organizing Angels for the
Blue Line, which will run until 8 p.m.
   Concerns have been voiced about the safety of the line, which
travels through territory that is home to an estimated 15,000 gang
members.
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has been contracted
to provide 118 deputies as security for the Blue Line and its
riders.

   The first Top Dog World Championship Prairie
Dog Shoot competition got under way Saturday with more than 100
shooters, despite the efforts of about two dozen animal rights
activists.
   Two protesters were issued citations for trespassing,
authorities said.
   When plans for the shooting contest became known three months
ago, outraged animal rights activists successfully lobbied Gov. Roy
Romer and U.S. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell to come out against it.
But local citizens rallied round the organizers, and all but three
of 318 people who attended a town meeting on the subject voted in
favor of the contest.
   One of the people at the meeting suggested a ``yuppie shoot''
might be in order, and after the vote, Mayor John Vanderpool
invited Romer and Campbell to ``buzz off.''
   More than $7,000 in prizes was at stake for hunters in the
two-day competition, billed as a way of reducing the population of
the foot-tall, grayish brown rodents, relatives of the squirrel.
   By the end of the hunt's first day, organizers said 1,162
prairie dogs had been killed, way over the maximum 500 predicted.
Hunt organizer Roger Culver attributed the high rate to
availability of dogs, good weather and marksmen's skill, but added
that no shooter had hit the 50 dogs allowed.
   Prairie dogs have multiplied geometrically in recent years
because of the drought, landowner Paul Carkhuff said.
   ``There used to be oats in that field that'd reach three feet,''
he said. ``Nobody can grow anything on land that the prairie dogs
have gotten to like this.''
   Six-inch-tall mounds around prairie dog burrows, spaced only a
few feet apart, harming plants and creating a hazard for livestock.
   Animal rights activists, however, believe shooting the animals
at all, much less for sport, is immoral.
   ``It's a contest of cruelty,'' said Shari Janger of Denver, a
member of the Rocky Mountain Humane Society and Prairie Dog Rescue.
``We just want them to stop this. They think it's their world down
here. It isn't. It's the state of Colorado.''
   About 25 protesters appeared at the 6 a.m. pancake breakfast at
the Moose Lodge, waving signs and shouting slogans. There were no
confrontations or incidents, other than a lot of yelling between
the protesters and local residents who turned out to watch the
demonstration.
   Police worked to keep hotheads on both sides apart, said
Montrose County Sheriff Tom Gilmore.
   Many of the locals said they enjoyed the news media activity as
much as the demonstrations, and took as many photographs of
reporters and television crews as they did of the protesters.
   ``We've just never had anything like this kind of attention
before,'' said Linda Norton, a local merchant and president of the
area's Chamber of Commerce, who estimated the combined population
of Nucla and nearby Naturita in southwestern Colorado at 1,500.
   Nucla merchants also were pleased. The only two motels in the
region were booked solid for the first time in several years,
restaurants and bars were full and souvenior hawkers reported brisk
sales.
   One activist who allegedly crossed onto private property was
issued a citation on the spot and a second demonstrator was removed
by deputies, taken to the local sheriff's office, issued a summons
and released, Undersheriff Mike Wiggins said.
   ``We gave him the summons, took him back out on the street and
turned him around five times and let him go,'' Wiggins said.
   The hunters, carrying everything from big-game rifles to
expensive target guns, were sent out in two-man teams to separate
ranches for six hours of shooting.
   Instead of letting the hunters just blaze away and counting up
the carcasses later, organizers established a point system.
Successful shots longer than 200 yards counted for two points,
those under that distance one point. Hunters were penalized one
point for every miss at more than 200 yards and two points at less
than 200 yards.
   Two teams sent to one ranch said they got off 18 shots in the
first hour, 14 of them hits. One man complained he and his partner
went three hours without taking a shot.
   Gilmore, who combined forces with neighboring San Miguel County
and state and federal land agencies to gather 25 officers, said he
would send a bill for the extra law enforcement to the shoot
sponsor, the Ten Ring Gun Club.
   ``We know it won't get paid, but they'll know how much this
cost,'' he said.

<HEAD>Church Convention Ends With Change of Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the world conference of the
Seventh-day Adventist Church ended their meeting Saturday after
making an exception to a hotly debated decision barring the
ordination of women.
   The ruling body of the church voted Wednesday against allowing
the ordination of women, after hours of discussion and splits along
geographical lines among the 1,500 delegates to the 55th world
conference.
   On Friday, delegates extended to women members some ministerial
duties denied in the earlier vote. The change allows local
congregations to grant women the right to perform marriages, a duty
formerly reserved for ordained ministers.
   Church spokesman Herbert Ford said the rule change ``does, in
effect, allow women to be a little closer to ordination.''
   In the earlier decision, delegates had voted along geographical
lines, 1,173 to 377, to accept a commission's report that ordaining
women would be disruptive to the world church and should not be
allowed.
   European and North American delegates offered the greatest
support for ordination, while leaders from Africa, Asia and South
American overwhelmingly opposed letting women preach the gospel.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church is separated into 11 geographical
divisions encompassing 190 countries and 6.2 million members.
   Robert S. Folkenberg, the church's world leader, capped the
10-day conference in downtown Indianapolis on Saturday, with an
overture for tolerance.
   ``This unity is not uniformity,'' Folkenberg said in addressing
the conference during worship service. ``If God wanted a church of
uniformity, he would not have made flowers of different colors...
   ``We are not a family of God unless we are building bridges to
all people of all nations.''
   Ford said women designated ``local elders'' by their
congregation will be allowed to perform marriages with the approval
of regional church officials. To become local elders, women must
have an undergraduate theology degree and an Adventist seminary
graduate degree and gain the approval of their congregation's
leaders.
   The earlier vote was influenced by a report from the church's
Role of Women Commission. The report said church unity would be
threatened if women were allowed to preach.

   Rebels stopped three buses and gunned
down at least 35 Moslem passengers in eastern Sri Lanka, Defense
Ministry officials said Saturday.
   Also Saturday, a Tamil politician claimed Sri Lankan soldiers
massacred nearly 1,000 Tamil civilians during the past month of
fighting with the rebels.
   At least 2,400 combatants and an undetermined number of
civilians have died since ethnic Tamils, who are mainly Hindu,
violated a cease-fire in June. They renewed their fighting against
government troops, who are mostly Buddhist Sinhalese.
   A top Sri Lankan army commander said Saturday that the military
could not win the civil war against the Tamil separatists.
   ``A political solution is the only way out,'' said Major General
G.H. de Silva, who commands the government forces in the eastern
region of this island nation.
   He said the rebels are starting hit-and-run operations,
effectively using crude but powerful land mines and guerrilla
strikes against the army.
   ``It is becoming difficult to control territory,'' said De
Silva, interviewed with several of his officers in the town of
Trincomalee.
   ``When you hit, he hides. When you move out, he comes back,'' he
said, referring to the rebels.
   Defense Ministry officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the rebels stopped three buses near the eastern town of
Kalmunai on Friday and shot and killed at least 35 passengers.
   All the victims were Moslems, they said. Moslem politicians put
the number of dead at 150.
   Moslems, who make up about 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, are often caught in the middle of the 7-year-old war
between Tamil rebels and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   According to residents of Kalmunai, Friday's killings were
intended as a warning to Moslems not to help soldiers hunt for
rebel hideouts.
   In another development, a Tamil politician accused the army of
intentionally killing at least 1,000 civilians in the latest bout
of fighting, which started last month after the rebels repudiated
the 13-month-long cease-fire.
   ``Since the fighting began on June 11, we fear nearly 1,000
Tamil civilians, men, women and children have been deliberately
massacred by the army in the east,'' said Kandian Premachandran.
   ``We concede civilians die when caught in the cross fire. But
what is happening in the east is they are being deliberately
massacred,'' he said.
   There was no immediate government reaction to Premachandran's
allegations.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunge denied news
reports that soldiers were killing Tamil civilians after clearing
towns and villages of rebels.
   Premachandran is an opposition member of Parliament and a leader
of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, a former
guerrilla group that gave up arms before entering politics. The
party opposes the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the rebel group
militia fighting for an independent Tamil homeland.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the population. They claim they are
discriminated against by Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population and control the government and armed forces.
   Tamil militants launched their movement for an independent
homeland in 1983. At least 13,400 people have died in the
insurrection.

   A jury on Saturday sentenced to death a
man who confessed to torturing and fatally strangling one boy and
stabbing to death two young brothers he found riding their bikes in
a park.
   A Clark County Superior Court jury deliberated for three days
before announcing the sentence against Westley Allan Dodd, 29, of
Vancouver.
   Dodd pleaded guilty June 11 to three counts of aggravated
first-degree murder for the murders of Cole Neer, 11, and William
Neer, 10, both of Vancouver, and Lee Iseli, 4, of Portland, Ore.
   The brothers were stabbed to death on Labor Day in Vancouver's
David Douglas Park, where they had gone to ride their bikes.
   Dodd said he abducted Iseli from a school playground in Portland
on Oct. 29 and took him across the Columbia River to Dodd's
Vancouver apartment. He repeatedly molested and tortured the boy
and finally killed him the next morning. Then Dodd hung the body in
a closet for a time before dumping it in a lake.
   Dodd was arrested about two weeks later when he tried to kidnap
a 6-year-old boy from a bathroom at a movie theater in Camas, Wash.
   The prosecution case included excerpts from Dodd's diary in
which he described in pornographic detail how he hoped to sexually
torture and kill children.
   Dodd's scrapbook included photographs he took of Lee Iseli
before and after his death. Beneath the photos were graphic and
detailed captions.
   ``He fantasized on it,'' said prosecutor Art Curtis. ``He killed
children for sexual pleasure. For fun. For the thrill of the hunt.''
   Defense attorney Lee Dane had argued Dodd might be insane. After
the sentence, Dane said he was not surprised.
   ``They evaluated very seriously,'' he said. ``You can't ask for
more than that.''
   Dodd had been convicted in 1984 of molestation charges in Idaho,
and again in 1987 in the Seattle area. Both charges involved young
boys. Dodd served 118 days in jail on the Seattle charges.
   ``It's real scary. He had a normal childhood ... He blossomed
into a mass murderer,'' said prosecutor Roger Bennett.
   Bob Iseli, father of Lee Iseli, said he was happy with
Saturday's verdict and didn't feel sorry for Dodd.
   ``I personally don't feel good about the death penalty,'' Iseli
said. ``But if we're going to shed a tear for anybody we're going
to shed a tear for my boy and the Neer boys.''
   ``Finally they got that piece of garbage off the street,'' said
Clair Neer, the father of the brothers.
   The defense called no witnesses and presented no evidence during
the trial, nor did his attorneys engage in any real
cross-examination of the state's witnesses.
   Dodd became the 10th person on Washington's death row under a
1981 state law that sanctions execution by hanging or lethal
injection _ depending on the wishes of the inmate. All nine of the
previous sentences are being appealed. Dodd's sentence also will be
automatically appealed.

   Connecticut Democrats endorsed U.S. Rep.
Bruce A. Morrison for governor Saturday, but gave enough backing to
underdog William J. Cibes Jr. to allow a Sept. 11 primary to decide
the nomination.
   Saturday's balloting by 1,449 delegates to the Democratic state
convention gave Morrison 69 percent to Cibes' 31 percent. A
candidate needed 20 percent to force the holding of a primary.
There has not been a Democratic gubernatorial primary since 1978.
   ``We want a candidate who is on the side of the working- and
middle-class families in the state,'' said Morrison, a four-term
congressman. ``That is the Democratic Party's legacy, that is what
people have been worried about and that's what I have to offer.''
   Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill decided in March not to seek
a third full term after 10 years in office. Challenged by Morrison
for the nomination, O'Neill said he feared a nasty campaign and
decided to pull out.
   He remained publicly neutral, but some of his loyalists worked
for Cibes.
   The primary winner will face Independent Lowell P. Weicker Jr.,
a former three-term Republican U.S. senator who has a commanding
lead in the polls, and Republican John G. Rowland, a three-term
congressman expected to be nominated at next weekend's GOP State
Conventin.
   For the first time in decades, the Democrats are not favored to
win the governor's race.
   U.S. Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly called Cibes' decision to force a
primary ``a foolish move'' when the Democrats face an uphill battle
in November.
   ``We will go on in September and in November to address the
specific fears of Connecticut voters and to be a problem solver to
build our future,'' said Cibes, a six-term state representative who
has focused on the need for a state personal income tax and
reductions in other taxes.
   Morrison promised to wage a positive campaign against Cibes.
   The convention also endorsed Morrison's choice for lieutenant
governor, former South Windsor Mayor Sandra Bender, who was
nominated by acclamation.
   Like O'Neill, Lt. Gov. Joseph J. Fauliso is retiring.
   Secretary of the State Julia H. Tashjian and Treasurer Francisco
L. Borges also were nominated, by acclamation, for re-election.
   Meanwhile, state Sen. Richard Blumenthal won the attorney
general endorsement, but state Rep. Jay B. Levin qualified for a
primary. And former state Sen. William E. Curry Jr. handily won the
comptroller endorsement, but four-term incumbent J. Edward Caldwell
also qualified for a primary.
   Levin and Caldwell said they had not decided whether or not to
conceed.

   The White House is getting ready to appoint a
panel of experts to review NASA operations in the wake of
embarrassing problems with two leaky shuttles and a flawed space
telescope, according to a report.
   CBS-TV reported on its ``Weekend News'' Saturday that the panel
probably will be named next week.
   ``I think the White House is disappointed with the priorities
coming out of the agency,'' George Washington University professor
John M. Logsdon told the network. ``I think there is a crisis of
confidence in NASA as an organization, in its management and its
leadership.''
   ``I don't have any comments on the CBS report,'' said White
House spokesman Sean Walsh.
   Although the space agency has named committees of its own to
look into recent problems, a White House oversight panel could be
seen as a response to congressional calls for an outside review of
NASA procedures.
   For example, Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., head of the Senate Commerce
space subcommittee, has said that the ``new (NASA) management team,
ironically, has been looking at this but the agency hasn't gotten
attention from the president and that's what's needed now.''
   A White House review of NASA probably would be coordinated by
the National Space Council, which is headed by Vice President Dan
Quayle and meets next week.
   CBS said Quayle ``reportedly got an earful of complaints against
NASA last week and is expected to take the lead in strategy
meetings beginning Monday.''
   The network said the White House concern is not so much with
NASA's recent string of technical problems, but the agency
bureaucracy's failure to deal with them adequately. Despite the
concern, the report said NASA Administrator Richard Truly, recently
appointed by President Bush, still has the White House's confidence.

   American governors meet with their Canadian
counterparts this week to strengthen their ties during this period
of uncertainty in Canada.
   Governors from 12 western states, along with the governor of
American Samoa, begin their three-day conference on Sunday.
   The highlight will be a meeting Monday of Premiers Gary Filmon
of Manitoba and Grant Devine of Saskatchewan. Representatives from
Alberta also will attend.
   Premier Bill Vander Zalm of British Columbia was invited but
said he was too busy to attend.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, this year's chairman of the
Western Governors' Association, said the western United States has
much in common with western Canada, and together they can make the
West strong.
   ``We need them, and they need us. We need each other,'' Sinner
said.
   The failure of the Meech Lake accord to win legislative approval
last month has left Canadians in confusion and political limbo,
Sinner said. The accord, a package of constitutional amendments,
would have conferred a special constitutional status on Quebec.
Canadians are concerned that its failure might spur a Quebec push
for independence.
   ``There werelots of forces at work to tie the western states to
the western provinces, but all those forces have been sharpened now
with the uncertainty that prevails in Canada,'' Sinner said.
   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson, who will succeed Sinner as
WGA chairman next year, said he hoped discussion of such
cross-border issues as trade, tourism, the environment and energy
would lead to stronger ties between the countries.
   ``We do a lot of work (with Canadians) already,'' Sinner said.
``We have border commissions to resolve problems. We have the free
trade agreement, which God knows has its imperfections. Hopefully,
we can build on that.''
   The WGA has proposed an office in Canada. A report to be
presented at this week's conference recommends locating the office
in Ottawa, the Canadian capital.
   Sinner, who favors locating the office in western Canada, said
he was uncertain whether the governors would decide on the location
this week.
   One conference session will feature a discussion involving the
governors and five authors and thinkers on the western region. The
authors have prepared a book of essays for the group called
``Beyond the Mythic West.''
   ``This book is meant to give the flavor of the evolving West, a
taste of its visions and thinking,'' Sinner said.
   The governors also will discuss new policy directions in water
and drought management, waste disposal, state and regional efforts
to develop international trade and relations with Indians.
   Govs. George Deukmejian of California, Rose Mofford of Arizona,
Kay Orr of Nebraska, Mike Hayden of Kansas and John Waihee of
Hawaii are unable to attend the conference.
   In addition to Sinner and Mickelson, governors expected to
attend are Roy Romer of Colorado, Cecil Andrus of Idaho, Rudy
Perpich of Minnesota, Stan Stephens of Montana, Bob Miller of
Nevada, Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico, Neil Goldschmidt of
Oregon, Norman Bangerter of Utah, Booth Gardner of Washington,
Michael Sullivan of Wyoming and Peter Colman of American Samoa.

   The spiritual leader of 250 million Orthodox
Christians said Saturday the third millennium of Christianity
should be a time for healing the ruptures that marked church
history in the last thousand years.
   ``Divisions and schisms cannot be justified in the life of the
churches,'' Patriarch Dimitrios declared during a special service
sponsored by the National Council of Churches at Columbia
University.
   Dimitrios, the first Orthodox patriarch to visit the United
States, arrived here from Washington Friday on the second leg of a
month-long tour.
   Saturday evening, Gov. Mario Cuomo hosted a dinner honoring
Dimitrios at the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World
Trade Center.
   At the morning service, Dimitrios was welcomed by the Very Rev.
Leonid Kishkovsky, an Orthodox archpriest and current president of
the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.
   Kishkovsky said the variety of religion in the United States
``almost exceeds the imagination'' and that many American
Christians were ``seeking an overarching and basic Christian
identity and unity that ... may be found in the early Christian
tradition.''
   Dimitrios responded that this century has seen the rise of an
ecumenical spirit in the world's religious communities.
   But the patriarch, whose own church came into being as a result
of a great schism with Rome in 1054, said that ``unhappily, the
second Christian millennium became a period of successive divisions.
   ``The ardent wish of all of us is that the impending third
millennium will be a time of healing from those wounds,'' he said,
speaking in Greek through a translator.
   ``The return to the undivided church of the first thousand years
is not so difficult so long as it is based on common historical and
theological sources and is purged of historical prejudices.''
   Two hundred people attended the service at the Chapel of
Interfaith Center, including Cardinal John J. O'Connor, Roman
Catholic archbishop of New York, who welcomed Dimitrios as ``a man
who can bridge the gap between East and West.''
   Most of the Eastern church's 250 million adherents live in
Eastern Europe, but there are 6 million in the United States,
including 1 million in the New York area, according to the Greek
Orthodox Archdiocese.
   The 75-year-old religious leader was in Washington for a week to
attend the 30th Greek Orthodox Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress. He
also will visit Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Chicago, Buffalo and
Boston.
   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I, installed in 1972, holds the
title Archbishop of Constantinople. Based in that city, now
Istanbul, he presides over the Albanian, Bulgarian,
Czechoslovakian, Georgian, Greek, Polish, Romanian, Russian and
Ukrainian Orthodox churches.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Kills One in Medellin; Police Seize Two Tons of Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded late Saturday in
front of police headquarters in the cocaine-trafficking center of
Medellin, killing one civilian and wounding 14, police said.
   Meanwhile, police reported seizing more than two tons of
cocaine, packaged and ready to be sent to the United States. They
said it was hidden in an underground storage locker on a farm in
northern Colombia.
   In the northwestern city of Medellin, the car bomb with more
than 80 pounds of dynamite exploded near the police headquarters
downtown, causing damage to nearby shops and a school, said the
city's police chief, Col. Jorge Ferrero.
   In a live radio interview, Ferrero said a bystander died at a
local hospital after being wounded in the bombing. Three of those
wounded were in critical condition at the hospital, he said.
   He said there were no police casualties.
   Police were searching for a suspect who activated the bomb and
fled, he said.
   The bombing was the fifth this year in Medellin. On Friday,
police deactivated a car bomb packed with about 450 pounds of
dynamite in the city.
   Since Friday, police reported seizing more than 3,000 pounds of
dynamite that the Medellin drug cartel was reportedly planning to
use for car bombings.
   Authorities blame the Medellin cocaine cartel for car bombings
and other terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of people in
the last eleven months. The violence followed a U.S.-backed
government crackdown on the cocaine trade.
   A police statement, read by the RCN radio network, said the
4,228 pounds of cocaine was seized Friday in a raid on a farm near
the town of Caucasia, about 250 miles north of Bogota.
   Also found on the farm were an electric generator and equipment
for processing cocaine, the statement said.
   Already this year, Colombian authorities have found and
destroyed more than 63,000 pounds of cocaine in an unprecedented
crackdown on the country's drug cartels.
   The latest seizure occurred as about 2,000 police officers and
army soldiers continued to search in the central Magdalena River
region for Pablo Escobar, the reputed leader of the Medellin cartel.
   Police say Escobar, accompanied by several bodyguards, is
fleeing their pursuit in the region, where the terrain alternates
between steep mountains and dense jungle.
   Four suspected drug terrorists were captured in Bogota and
another in Medellin, the national police chief, Gen. Miguel Gomez,
said at a press conference late Friday.
   Gomez added that police in the city of Pereira had captured
another suspected cartel member on Friday. The suspect, Otoniel
Gonzalez, is the seventh most important member of the cartel, Gomez
said.
   Gunmen allegedly working for the cartel continued their attacks
against police in Medellin, killing two more policemen late Friday.
Three of the assailants were killed when police returned fire, a
police communique said.
   Gunmen have shot and killed 142 police officers in the city this
year. Most of the attacks have been blamed on the Medellin cartel,
which is said to be offering a bounty of over $4,000 for each
policeman killed.

   More than 600
scuba divers and schools of colorful fish were treated to a
three-hour concert in the scenic coral reefs of the Florida Keys on
Saturday.
   The selections for the 6th Annual Underwater Music Festival,
broadcast from five speakers into the underwater preserve, ranged
from reggae to Tchaikovsky. They included the theme from the motion
picture ``Jaws.''
   ``I just wanted to give them something to think about,'' laughed
disc jockey Barry Scot of WWUS radio, which sponsored the festival
to educate divers about reef protecton and conservation.
   Each of the speakers was connected to above-water receivers that
picked up radio signals from the nearby station on Big Pine Key.
   ``It was like listening to music in three dimension,'' said
Kelly LaComb of Key West. ``The sound was so clear. It seemed like
it was going through your body.''

<HEAD>Former Boy Scout Spared Death in Fatal Beating of Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge overruled a jury's death
penalty recommendation for a former Boy Scout convicted of fatally
beating a security guard with a wrought-iron pink flamingo.
   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Walter N. Colbath Jr. told a
rapt courtroom Friday that he felt anguish deciding the fate of
23-year-old Charles Young.
   Police testified that Young bludgeoned security guard Leslie
Skomp with the decorative flamingo when confronted during a late
night break-in at a produce market here. After Young's conviction
in April, the jury voted 9-3 to send him to the electric chair.
   But Colbath concluded Young ``is the product of one of the most
dysfunctional families, spanning three generations, ever presented
to this court.''
   Young's grandparents were alcoholics; he was physically abused
by his stepfather, as was his mother, and he was left mentally
disturbed, the judge said.
   ``None of the above excuses the defendant's cruel and atrocious
conduct on the night of Dec. 1, 1987,'' Colbath said. ``It does,
however, explain why the defendant, who had lived his life as a
fantasy, suddenly snapped and lost control when faced with the
reality of being caught red-handed in a burglary by the victim.''
   Young faces at least 25 years in prison without parole. Related
robbery, theft and burglary convictions could keep him in prison
another 28 years.
   ``You are a likeable young man. I think with the proper
treatment, you would have a lot to offer,'' the judge said as Young
was led away. ``Good luck, Charlie.''

   Illinois's Sara Helena Martin was named
America's Young Woman of the Year Saturday night and took home a
$30,000 college scholarship she said she would spend to become a
linguist.
   ``I'm just numb,'' the 19-year-old Miss Martin of Schaumburg
said, receiving hugs from the 49 other contestants who competed for
shares of a total $75,000 in scholarships. ``The way I got here was
being true to myself, believing in my own values.''
   Runners-up were Seema Sueko Ahmed, 17, of Honolulu, and
Mississippi's Rosalie Landicho Reyes, 17, of Waynesboro. Miss Ahmed
received a $15,000 scholarship and Miss Reyes was awarded a $10,000
scholarship.
   The 50 participants displayed their talents _ in everything from
opera singing to an impersonation of Michael Jackson _ in a stage
production Saturday night at the Mobile Civic Center before some
2,000 cheering family members and friends.
   The rest of the prizes were parceled out in individual
categories on Thursday, Friday and earlier Saturday.
   The judging focused on six categories: scholastic achievement;
spirit; fitness; presence and composure; creative and performing
arts, and on the basis of a personal interview with the judges. Six
awards of $500 were given in each category, for a total of $18,000.
   Coca-Cola Co. gave an additional $2,000 in the Coca-Cola Spirit
Award to Montana's Alycia Nathe of Plentywood, Mont.
   The program, which began in 1958, was known as America's Junior
Miss until the name was changed last year.

   The wrecked Coast Guard cutter
Mesquite was scuttled into a watery grave in Lake Superior on
Saturday to become a tourist attraction for sports divers.
   ``She is on the bottom,'' said Capt. Jimmie Hobaugh, who
commands the Coast Guard station at Sault Ste. Marie.
   The 180-foot cutter ran aground Dec. 4 off Keweenaw Point, and
was battered against rocks for several days, leaving the hull in
pieces.
   The sinking had to wait until bulkhead cracks were welded shut
so the Mesquite could be towed to her resting place, said Petty
Officer Frank Jennings, a Coast Guard spokesman at regional
headquarters in Cleveland.
   Salvagers removed excess air from the tanks before sealing them,
to make sure the ship sank, he said.
   A 250-foot barge was brought in to tow the Mesquite two miles
south to Keystone Bay, to become part of the proposed Keweenaw
Underwater Preserve.
   Before scuttling, commercial salvagers removed anything of
value. Hobaugh said what remained ``is just a piece of junk.''
   ``It's like when a person dies,'' he said. ``The soul goes away
and you've got a sack of oats left. That's what a minister told me
once to help me deal with picking up bodies. It's the same thing.''
   The Mesquite's captain, Lt. Cmdr. John Lynch, faces court
martial on negligence charges. He was criticized for assigning too
few crew members to check the ship's position.
   Two other ship's officers were reprimanded in the grounding.
   Officials say it would cost $35 million to replace the
48-year-old cutter.

<TEXT>
   Armed Mohawk Indians embroiled in a land
dispute with authorities agreed Saturday to lift a bridge blockade
near Montreal after a provincial official promised to reduce the
police contingent in this town.
   The agreement was announced after Quebec Native Affairs Minister
John Ciaccia met for more than six hours with Indian
representatives in an effort to end the dispute that has left one
police officer dead.
   The meeting came as Indians manned barricades at a reservation
near Oka and blockaded the Mercier Bridge linking Montreal with its
populous suburbs onthe south shore of the St. Lawrence River.
   Ciaccia said the bridge blockade could be lifted as early as
Sunday, but he refused to elaborate on the terms of the agreement.
   But Mohawk representative Ellen Gabriel said the Indians had
agreed to reopen the bridge in return for a ``significant
reduction'' of the police presence in Oka.
   Highways leading to the bridge were blockaded Wednesday by
Mohawks of the Kahnawake reserve following an armed clash between
provincial police and Mohawks manning barricades on the reservation
near Oka.
   Since the clash, Mohawks and police have been locked in a tense
standoff in Oka. The Indians have refused to take down their
barricades.
   Ciaccia said the talks Saturday resulted in the ``beginnings of
proposals'' to end the Oka confrontation.
   ``You should all be very happy that we are announcing a solution
for one very serious problem and the beginnings of a solution for
the entire problem,'' he told reporters.
   Ciaccia refused to elaborate on the proposals, saying he must
first consult with the provincial government. He said he would
return to Oka on Sunday to continue the talks.
   Gabriel also refused to discuss details of the negotiations, but
said she is optimistic a solution can be found to the Oka dispute.
   The confrontation has left one police officer dead after
Wednesday's shootout with Mohawks manning barricades in Oka, 20
miles west of Montreal. It is unclear if the officer was shot by
Mohawks or fellow police.
   The Mohawks from the Kanehsatake Indian community set up
barricades at Oka to stop the municipality from expanding a golf
course onto what the Indians claim is ancestral territory.
   Mohawk activists from the Kahnawake reserve had threatened to
destroy the Mercier Bridge if police moved to dismantle their
blockade.
   One banner strung across a trailer near the bridge said ``Stop
Canadian Apartheid and Amerindian genocide.''
   The blockade of the bridge has sparked widespread anger among
local white residents. The highway to the bridge passes through the
Indian reservation.
   The Quebec provincial police riot squad was called out Saturday
for the second straight night as angry white residents milled
around the edge of the reserve, at times trying to storm police
barricades around the area.
   The Quebec police were backed up by a force of about 100 Royal
Canadian Mounted Police.
   About 2,000 people chanted ``We want the army!'' and jeered at
police officers who protected people whom the demonstrators
suspected of being Indians.
   Witnesses said the crowd attempted to rush the barricades but
police pushed them back.
   The local residents said they wanted to prevent the Mohawks from
leaving the reservation since the Indians were hindering them from
getting to Montreal.
   Both Mohawks and other local residents have complained that food
is running out in the area, which has been sealed off by police.
   Quebec provincial police spokesman Pierre Rochefort said reports
that people are being prevented from carrying food past police
barricades are ``rumors.'' He described the police action as
``traffic control.''
   Police blocked non-residents and the media from the Oka area.
   The Canadian military confirmed Friday that 40 members of the
2nd Combat Engineers have been stationed in Cornwall, Ontario, near
the Akwesasne Mohawk reserve. It straddles the borders of Quebec,
Ontario and New York state.
   The move is believed to have been made because of fears that
Mohawk Indians from the Akwesasne reserve may try to occupy the
international bridge linking Ontario and New York state.

   A lawyer accused of spanking a client
pleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor assault charges and agreed to
surrender his law license for five years.
   Smyrna attorney John Kersey was charged with assault after a
client accused him of spanking her May 25 at his office during a
consultation for a divorce.
   The 27-year-old woman told police that Kersey locked her in his
office, quizzed her on multiplication tables and threatened to hit
her if she missed a figure. She said he then ordered her to read a
magazine, spanked her and made demeaning remarks.
   During the hearing before Circuit Court Judge James Clayton,
Kersey also agreed to seek counseling and serve an 11-month, 29-day
probation.
   Since his June arrest, 11 other women had come forward to accuse
Kersey of similar actions.
   No other charges will be pursued against him because the
accusations are more than a year old and have passed the statute of
limitations, District Attorney Guy Dotson said.
   Kersey attempted suicide July 3 by shooting himself in the chest
and had been hospitalized. Dotson said Kersey would leave
immediately for counseling.

   The agency that ran nuclear weapons production
in the 1940s rejected secret advice to study cancer risks for its
workers, even though it knew some were exposed to large doses of
radiation, documents show.
   Records of the Atomic Energy Commission also show that airborne
emissions of radiation continued at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation
in Washington state from the plant's start-up in 1944 until at
least the mid-1950s.
   The AEC was a predecessor to the Energy Department, which owns
all the government's nuclear arms factories. The government first
acknowledged the Hanford problems publicly in 1986, although much
information about radiation releases there is still classified as
secret.
   On Thursday, a panel of health experts disclosed that one in 20
residents living near Hanford, on the Columbia River near Richland,
Wash., between late 1944 and December 1947 absorbed a level of
radiation equal to 1,200 times what the Energy Department now
considers a safe limit.

   The Republican Party is urging its local leaders
to rally behind President Bush as he considers tax increases that
many in the GOP wish he would go back to opposing.
   The president's abrupt switch on taxes late last month caught
most Republicans off guard, and left many questioning why Bush
would abandon his campaign pledge with crucial 1990 elections just
four months away.
   After initially lying low in the tax debate, party leaders came
out swinging Friday, painting Bush's turnabout as a tough but bold
move to help erase the federal deficit.
   Republican Illinois Gov. James Thompson said Bush ``had the
courage to summon up the political will to do what was right for

   While the government is redesigning currency
to thwart counterfeiters, it ought to make the bills more
attractive, says a man who used to run the Treasury's
money-producing agency.
   ``The principles and history of a country are recounted in the
art of bank notes,'' Robert J. Leuver told the Senate Banking
Committee on Friday. ``We seem to have lost the art, majesty and
history provided in our national bank notes of 1896, silver
certificates of 1896 and the beautiful $2 bill of 1976.''
   ``The `Tin Lizzy' (vintage car) on the back of the $10 bill
harkens to a different time and does not afford the counterfeit
detection we need,'' said Leuver, a former chief of the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing who now directs the American Numismatic
Association.
   Leuver said most of the anti-counterfeiting deterrents built
into currency are less effective than they could be because of the
50-year-old design of the bills.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using ammunition provided by the Federal
Reserve, the stock market hit a lofty target this past week.
   Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial
average crossed the 3,000 level for the first time, reaching that
landmark faster than even many bullish analysts thought possible
just a few weeks ago.
   Analysts gave Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, credit for making it happen when it did.
   Greenspan surprised Wall Street's legion of Fed-watchers in a
congressional appearance Thursday with what appeared to be a clear
signal that the Fed was making a significant shift in credit policy.
   He told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank was
ready to ease monetary conditions, fostering lower interest rates,
in response to rising evidence of a squeeze on bank credit.
   In so doing, he hinted strongly that the Fed had moved closer to
mollifying critics in the Bush administration and on Wall Street
who had been urging the central bank to take steps to avert a
potential recession.
   The response in the financial markets was immediate, as visions
of more plentiful money and a stimulus to the sluggish economy sent
traders scrambling to buy both stocks and bonds.
   In addition, many analysts said, Greenspan's comments were taken
as reassurance for investors who have been worrying that a
stringent new approach among bank lending officers and regulators
might put a choke-hold on the economy.
   ``I think the most important thing he said is to acknowledge
that he is as concerned about current lending practices in banking
as we are,'' said Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in Albany,
N.Y. ``We hadn't received that kind of acknowledgment before.''
   On Friday, activities by the Fed in the money markets appeared
to confirm the message that it was seeking to encourage short-term
interest rates to decline.
   But with all those promising developments, observers said the
markets still faced obstacles.
   In the past, they noted, expressions of willingness from the Fed
to try to avert recessions have not always meant immediate success
on that score.
   Furthermore, they added, any commitment by the central bank to
easier credit could waver should the news on inflation start to
turn uglier at any point.
   The price of gold, widely regarded as an sensitive measure of
inflationary expectations, sounded a faintly ominous note by
rallying along with stocks and bonds on the prospect of stimulus by
the Fed.
   Still, stock-market investors made their endorsement of
Greenspan's move easy to read. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed Friday at 2,980.20, up 75.25 from the week
before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 4.55 to
200.33; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 7.90 to 468.44, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 5.12 at 363.99.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 171.27 million shares a day, up
from 125.07 million the week before.
   Anticipation of a Fed move toward easier credit increased on
Wall Street with a recent push in the White House and Congress
toward a plan for reducing the federal budget deficit.
   Any moves to cut government spending or raise taxes would
represent a tightening of fiscal policy, which would stand to slow
the economy further.
   So many commentators began looking for the Fed to adopt a
counterbalancing approach by relaxing its monetary policy.
   Those hopes seem to have been fulfilled. Now stock and bond
traders can set up watch to see whether the Fed can get results to
realize its new stated intentions.

<HEAD>Takeovers Back in the News, But Nowhere Near the Rage of Late
1980s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a while it looked like the good old days,
with takeovers, defensive alliances and stock rumors coming one
after another: two phone giants merging, a French hotelier buying
an American budget motel chain, two technology companies forming a
strategic joint venture.
   There even was wild speculation that Mitsubishi Group, the
Japanese industrial conglomerate that made the planes used to
dive-bomb Pearl Harbor, would buy a big piece of an old World War
II aviation adversary, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   But that rumor was denied, and a closer look at the deals done
this past week showed they bore little in common with a typical
wild week of takeover news in the last half of the 1980s.
   For one thing, there was an absence of junk bonds, the risky
IOUs used to bankroll many of the high-profile transactions of the
past decade.
   The corporate buyers of 1990 must carry less speculative tools,
like cash, stock or secured bank loans, partly because attempts to
peddle junk-bond debt to raise takeover money are largely futile
now. The rising number of junk-bond defaults has scared most buyers
away.
   Another difference in the deals of this past week was that none
of the buyers were unfriendly outside investors motivated by the
greedy quick money mentality that colored many other high-profile
takeovers of the past decade. On the contrary, all had a direct
business interest in what they were buying.
   The most obvious example also was the biggest, not only of the
week but the year. Contel Corp., the nation's No. 3 independent
telephone company, accepted a takeover offer from GTE Corp, the No.
1 independent, in a stock swap valued at $6 billion.
   The merger will create a leading operator of cellular phone
systems, one of the fastest-growing segments of the
telecommunications industry. Both partners called their marriage
``a perfect combination.''
   The week's other prominent deal was the French lodging company
Accor SA's $1.3 billion agreement to buy Motel 6, one of the
best-known purveyors of budget roadside lodging in the United
States. Accor thus will become the biggest operator of low-priced
hotel rooms in the world.
   The deal also was notable because of the identity of the seller:
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The New York investment group made
leveraged buyout a household term last decade and holds the record
for the biggest LBO in history, the $25 billion debt-financed
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. early last year.
   The ultimate wisdom of Kohlberg's RJR deal remains unclear. But
its purchase of Motel 6 five years ago appears to have been a sound
choice. Investors who participated in that debt-financed
transaction will make a 21.5 percent rate of return on their money
when Accor completes its purchase.
   The third notable corporate transaction of the week was a
strategic alliance by International Business Machines Corp. and
Diebold Inc. to manufacture and market automated bank teller
machines worldwide.
   The combined ATM operation will be the nation's largest and will
enable each company to benefit from the other's strengths without a
costly investment, a major motivation for many companies that have
sought joint ventures recently.
   The developments of the past week reflect the underlying themes
of a long-term strategy that has shaped a growing number of other
recent takeovers.
   Philip Morris Cos., for example, is buying a Swiss candymaker
for $3.8 billion. ConAgra Inc. is purchasing Beatrice Co. for $1.34
billion. In both instances, the buyer's existing businesses will be
strengthened.
   In what may be an ironic twist, the increased takeover action
has coincided with a reluctance by many corporations to take
advantage of tough anti-takeover laws that many legislatures have
enacted to protect state businesses.
   Earlier this month, for example, H.J. Heinz Co. said it
voluntarily would relinquish the anti-takeover protections offered
by its home state, Pennsylvania, which enacted the nation's
toughest anti-takeover law last spring.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The nation's top banker surprised the markets by acknowledging
the possibility of a credit crunch and his willingness to ease
interest rates. The remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan energized Wall Street, pushed stocks to a record and
briefly vaulted the Dow Jones average over 3,000.
   _Readings of the economy's health suggested reduced chances of
recession. The government said retail sales rose sharply in June,
the first big gain in five months, while inflation remained
moderate. Major automakers said sales strengthened in mid-July,
extending a sales gain in the troubled industry that began in June.
   _The savings &amp; loan scandal grew in severity. The former head of
a big Texas thrift was indicted on 17 counts of fraud and other
crimes, President Bush felt compelled to publicly defend son Neil
for his alleged role in the collapse of a Colorado thrift, and the
Senate passed a crime bill that would punish high-level S&amp;L
executives convicted of fraud with life imprisonment.
   _The first jury trial against a Wall Street professional
incriminated by notorious inside trader Ivan Boesky ended with a
conviction on four counts and a mistrial on 26 others. Defendant
John A. Mulheren Jr., a stock speculator and former Boesky
confidante, said he will appeal the guilty verdict.

   A federal judge in Washington state ruled Friday
in favor of 21 Filipino seamen who claimed a Japanese steamship
company failed to pay them 80 percent of their salaries on eight
wood-shipping trips to Washington state.
   The seamen could collect up to $40 million, which would be the
largest wage judgment entered in maritime history, said attorneys
and supporters of the plaintiffs.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner did not set a dollar figure in
ruling for the Filipinos, said the court clerk's office in Tacoma,
Wash. The 21 were suing the Innui Steamship Co., Ltd., a subsidiary
of Japan's second largest shipping firm, Mitsui.
   The seamen charged the company used ``double bookkeeping'' to
defraud them, and forced them to sign bogus contracts and wage
receipts for wages never paid.
   ``This scam has been going on for years and not just on this
ship,'' said Richard J. Dotson, attorney for the plaintiffs. ``This
victory sends a clear message to all offending ship owners: if
you're going to cheat and mistreat your crew, don't sail into an
American port.''
   According to the suit, the M-V Pine Forest carried timber on
eight trips between Washington state and Japan. Trial testimony
showed the workers received less than 20 percent of the wages due
them.
   The underpayment was discovered when a ship chaplain visited an
injured crew member at an Anchorage, Alaska, hospital. He called in
the Center for Seafarers' Rights, which provided an attorney.
   The announcement of the ruling was made in New York at the
Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey, which is home
to the Center for Seafarers' Rights.
   The institute is a 157-year-old non-profit agency that deals
with the maritime industry and merchant seafarers around the world.

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Co. Projects Fiscal Results</HEAD>

   Campbell Soup Co. said Friday the company
would achieve nearly break-even net earnings this year due to a
major restructuring announced last month.
   Campbell's chief executive officer, David W. Johnson, made the
announcement to analysts at a meeting in New York City.
   He said earnings for the period ending July 31 will be flat as a
result of after-tax charges of $247 million against net income in
the fourth quarter.
   In June, Campbell announced it would put up for sale its U.S.
and Canadian fresh foods and fresh produce businesses, with
combined net sales of more than $300 million, and close or sell a
score of plants. The company said it planned to concentrate on its
more profitable units.
   The company has been ``diligently working to prune those parts
of the business that have been dragging down our earnings,''
Campbell told the analysts.
   Campbell posted a profit of $13.1 million, or 10 cents a share,
in fiscal 1989 on revenues of $5.67 billion, a sharp drop from
profits of $274.1 million, or $2.12 per share, on revenues of $4.87
billion the year before. The decline was due to previous
restructuring costs.
   Campbell's recent sluggish performance and depressed stock price
have made it the target of frequent takeover rumors. Some members
of the founding Dorrance family, which owns a major stake, have
urged a sale of the entire company.
   Over the next few years, Johnson said Campbell's plans to boost
its earnings per share by 20 percent annually. He said the company
also plans to achieve at least a 20 percent return on equity and a
20 percent cash return on assets.
