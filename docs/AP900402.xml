   The investigation of the deadly Southeastern mail
bombings continues ``like mad,'' a civil rights leader says, but
with a much lower profile since the day agents searched a septic
tank as TV cameras rolled.
   The FBI won't say whether there have been any developments in
the probe of the bombings that killed a federal judge and a civil
rights attorney, and there have been few signs of progress in the
case, now more than 100 days old.
   ``There's nothing new here,'' FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez
said recently in Washington. ``The investigation is ongoing, but as
far as any specifics, no one can get into that.''
   Hundreds of federal agents have participated in the
investigation. Three men were subjected to extensive searches and
media scrutiny, but no one has been identified as a suspect.
   NAACP Southeast Regional Director Earl Shinhoster, who has
received regular briefings on the case, said he doesn't feel it's
near being solved.
   ``My own view is they're as close as they were in December,''
said Shinhoster. But he said he's satisfied the government hasn't
decreased its investigative effort.
   ``They are on this case like mad,'' he said.
   The Dec. 16-19 bombings killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance at his Mountain Brook, Ala., home and
Savannah, Ga., Alderman Robert Robinson, who had done legal work
for the National Advancement of Colored People.
   Bombs were intercepted at the 11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta
and the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Follow-up letters indicated the motivation for the attacks was
racism, and threatened further violence.
   Shinhoster said the search for the typewriter used to write the
letters continues to be a main focus of the investigation.
   ``I think the person who finds that typewriter will be given $5
million,'' he joked.
   FBI agents, with reporters close behind, swarmed over
Enterprise, Ala., on Jan. 22 and searched property of the probe's
first apparent target, junk shop owner Robert Wayne O'Ferrell. They
apparently came up empty.
   There still are some FBI agents in the small town, said FBI
spokesman Doug Marshall.
   O'Ferrell, who wrote letters criticizing the appeals court after
losing a workers compensation case, is one of the three who have
come under the most scrutiny.
   The others are Brian Joseph Fleming, an Enterprise print shop
owner previously indicted on gun-running charges with business ties
to O'Ferrell, and Walter Leroy Moody Jr., a self-employed literary
consultant from Rex, Ga., who was convicted in a 1972 bomb case.
   O'Ferrell said that since testifying before a grand jury in
Birmingham, Ala., on March 6, he has had only one contact with
authorities.
   ``They returned some of my merchandise and paperwork they
carried off,'' he said. ``Tax papers _ stuff like that.''
   ``I just kind of assume they'll keep a low profile until they
arrest someone, and then they'll leave me alone,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Voters in this college town on Monday
approved a token $5 fine on abortion, should the procedure be
banned, and a fivefold increase in the city's $5 marijuana penalty.
   With all 63 precincts counted, the abortion proposal declaring
Ann Arbor a ``zone of reproductive freedom'' passed 15,698 to
8,578, said Deputy Clerk Yvonne Carl.
   The proposal to raise the fine for possessing marijuana from $5
to $25 was approved 12,901 to 11,419, Carl said.
   Local and statewide elections were scheduled for Tuesday in
three other states.
   Despite media attention surrounding the proposals, Carl said
most residents were concerned about a $28 million bond proposal to
fund landfills and launch a major recycling program in the city,
Carl said.
   ``That's the one that will affect our daily way of living,'' she
said. The proposal passed 18,866 to 5,601.
   About twice as many voters as usual turned out for municipal
elections to cast ballots on 13 City Council candidates for five
seats and six proposals, including the abortion rights and
marijuana fine questions, officials said.
   The estimated 33 percent turnout was considerably higher than
the city's normal election turnout of 15 percent to 18 percent,
said City Clerk Winifred Northcross.
   The abortion measure, known as Proposal C, amends the city's
charter by imposing a fine similar to a parking ticket should
federal or state law ever restrict abortion. Who would pay the fine
would depend on how the penalty was stated in the federal or state
law.
   The marijuana measure, or Proposal B, was put on the ballot by
the council. The $5 fine for possession and sale of marijuana was
adopted in 1972 and reinstated in 1974 after Republicans repealed
it.
   Opponents of the small fine said the minor penalty has created a
perception of the city as being a haven for drugs.
   Carl said earlier it was difficult to predict how many of the
25,000 students at the University of Michigan would vote, but
backers of the abortion provision counted on student support.
   ``A good turnout means to us that we'll win and it's up all over
town,'' said Sabra Briere, coordinator of the effort to place the
abortion measure on the ballot.
   Right to Life of Michigan has not opposed the provision,
concentrating on its statewide drive to gather signatures
initiating a measure requiring that girls 17 and younger obtain a
parent's consent for abortion.
   Republican members of the Ann Arbor City Council opposed the
charter provision, maintaining it will clutter up the charter and
was designed to draw Democratic voters to the polls to help elect
Democratic candidates.
   ``The Supreme Court has already relegated this issue back to the
states and that's where it belongs, not on a local community
level,'' said Ingrid Sheldon, a Republican council member who
describes herself as pro-choice but against the provision.
   In Tuesday's races:
   _ In Missouri, St. Louis County _ which does not include the
city of St. Louis _ votes on a proposed increase in hotel and motel
taxes; Kansas City, Mo., voters consider a $1.89 monthly fee for
curbside trash recycling;
   _ Wisconsin voters choose a judge for a 10-year term on the
Supreme Court, consider a constitutional limit on the governor's
partial veto power and decide the fate of a state lawmaker recalled
in an Indian spearfishing rights dispute;
   _ In Oklahoma, Tulsa voters elect a mayor and nine councilman as
the city switches from the city commission to city council form of
government, a move approved by voters last year. Incumbent Mayor
Rodger Randle, a Democrat, is opposed by state Rep. Frank Pitezel,
a Republican, for mayor.

<TEXT>
   In the quiet of the morning, when the sun
peeks over the rolling farm fields, the trek to the golden dome
begins. One by one, businessmen arrive, ready to start their day _
by sitting in silence.
   There are oil brokers and engineers. A toymaker, too. All are
successful entrepreneurs. And all are meditators.
   Thousands of souls have flocked to this meditation mecca, home
of Maharishi International University, to study, share a lifestyle
and build their own businesses _ a trend that has spawned
prosperity and growth in an isolated patch of America's heartland.
   ``It is a remarkable community,'' says Daniel Dittemore, head of
the Iowa Product Development Corporation, a state-sponsored seed
capital investment program. ``They have an uncommon appetite and
knack for entrepreneurship.''
   In the last several years, scores of transcendental meditators
have moved their companies to Fairfield or begun new ones here.
There's an ice cream maker who markets to stores in New York,
Chicago and other cities, a chimney sweep supplier with thousands
of customers, a studio that photographs many of the country's top
marathons, and a toymaker who produces the Zube Tube, a hot-selling
cylinder touted as the ``ultimate cosmic sound machine.''
   Othrs are engineers, attorneys, insurance agents or computer
experts. By one estimate, there are about 20 computer companies,
thus the nickname ``Silicorn Valley.''
   ``There's a remarkable population of technologically oriented
companies out of all proportion of what you'd expect to find in a
community that size,'' said Dittemore.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has dubbed Fairfield, a town of 11,000,
one of the state's economic ``superstars.''
   The local business chamber doesn't track the number of companies
run or owned by meditators, but some in the community claim such
firms employ about 1,000 people and more than 50 do business
nationally or overseas.
   ``We've put a lot of energy into this town, a lot of money, a
lot of talent and a lot of job opportunities,'' said John Narducci,
president of Chappell Studio-Marathon Foto, which photographs
marathons and nearly a quarter-million graduates annually.
   ``Any small town in the Midwest would like to have 2,500
people,'' said Jerry Leahy, a meditator who is board chairman of
Overland Outfitters, a family-owned outerwear firm with 11 stores
nationwide. ``It just isn't often you have them come in and bring
their own jobs and bring their own payroll.''
   Though meditators contribute to Fairfield's success, they're not
the prime movers, said Mike Brouwer, executive vice president of
the Chamber of Commerce, which has about 400 members.
   ``I'm not willing to slight 22 major manufacturers in this
community _ some have been here over 100 years,'' he said.
   But he credits the meditators with creating innovative ways to
support themselves.
   Some come because of the university, others because ``the
benefits seem to grow when you're meditating with other people,''
said Patty Schneider, public affairs chief at the college, founded
by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Indian guru who once dazzled the
Beatles and other celebrities.
   Transcendental meditators believe if they gather in large
numbers, they create the ``Maharishi Effect'' _ a positive
influence on events ranging from global conflicts to the rate of
traffic deaths. More than 7,000 meditators gathered here in 1983
for the ``Taste of Utopia.''
   Each morning and afternoon, meditators practice their technique
in the Golden Domes of Pure Knowledge _ one for ladies, one for
gents, to avoid distractions.
   Estimates of meditators range from 2,000 to 3,000; many attend
or work at the university, which moved from California in 1974 into
the campus of defunct Parsons College and has a full-time
enrollment of 799. Meditators also run their own school for
elementary and high school students.
   Male MIU students often wear ties and jackets, and jeans are
discouraged.
   The strait-laced appearance fits in well with mid-America, and
meditators work side-by-side with non-meditators in businesses and
the City Council.
   But ``there's still the dividing line between those people and
some people in the community,'' said Royse Huff, president of the
Fairfield Economic Development Association.
   Some things remain destined to stay separate, such as the yogic
flying competitions, which prompted one enterprising company years
ago to sell cushions to soften levitation landings.
   Yogic flying, according to Vedic tradition, has three stages:
hopping (usually cross-legged on a padded course), hovering and
flying. ``We have been in the first stage quite a number of
years,'' Mrs. Schneider says.
   Such happenings trigger jokes and the nickname ``the flying
university.''
   Brouwer doesn't mind. ``I have such a thick skin over it over
the years that it doesn't bother me because there are so many good
things that come out of the relationship between MIU and
Fairfield,'' he said.
   Mayor Bob Rasmussen sees envy behind the tongue-in-cheek teasing.
   ``We don't have a lot of empty buildings, valuation of houses
has increased substantially,'' he said. ``They can make all the fun
they want. We're doing just fine, and thank you.''
   The town, he added, is not about to lose its identity. ``I'm a
strong believer we have enough of a solid base ... it's not going
to be a matter of them taking over the city,'' he said.
   But the mayor also noted attitudes have changed since the early
days when some townsfolk wondered if the meditators were a cult or
a religion.
   ``There's certainly a stronger acceptance ... (and) less
divisiveness,'' he said. ``They've integrated much better ... We
respect each other and get along.''
   ``Iowans have a work ethic and a sense of clean living that we
fit very well with as a group,'' said Rob Glazier, a meditator
whose engineering firm has grown from four employees to 75 in three
years.
   Some say acceptance just took time.
   ``People in a town like this have been here three or four
generations,'' said Bob Daniels, a meditator with a chimney sweep
supply company. ``They may want to take 10 years checking you out.
That's not bad.''
   Glazier said old-line business leaders also realize ``we're a
larger economic force,'' attracting outside capital.
   Indeed, Huff praises the meditators for demonstrating ``how
business can be done internationally.'' Others say they've added a
cosmopolitan flavor to Fairfield.
   But problems remain. While meditators are terrific promoters,
Brouwer said there's a credibility gap. ``They traditionally say
things before they do things,'' he said, and ``market before the
fact.'' Huff also said there has been a ``tremendous turnover'' of
meditator businesses.
   There have been legal troubles, too. The state sued a
self-proclaimed ``millionaire maker'' after he failed to make
refunds to 10,000 consumers who bought his no-down-payment real
estate courses advertised on TV. A $3.5 million judgment was
entered against him, but he has filed for bankruptcy.
   The meditators remain committed to their goal of creating heaven
on earth.
   ``We're not quite as utopian,'' the mayor responds. ``When they
say this is heaven, I like Fairfield, but I like Naples, Fla.,
too.''

   From the newly initiated quest to send people to
Mars to the decades-old search for a cure for cancer, the
government's science programs are a source of technological
breakthroughs and national pride. Federal spending on science is
far from the largest or fastest-growing part of the budget, but it
is a favorite target for budget-cutters. This is the first in a
series of articles this year that will track the progress of one
portion of the federal budget _ science spending.

   When the White House's chief science adviser
visited the Senate Budget Committee recently, he spent much of his
time responding to a single, recurring complaint.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. James Sasser of Tennessee, said
costly projects such as the space station, $30 billion over several
years, short-change other researchers and science students in favor
of ``a high-visibility, high-media type operation.''
   The adviser, D. Allan Bromley, countered that the expensive
projects will benefit thousands of scientists and ``make possible
scientific understanding of the world, of our universe.''
   The dispute was left unresolved. But it sums up a growing
concern in today's era of relentless federal deficits: that a
burgeoning array of big-ticket science programs threatens to crowd
out a much larger number of less expensive but valuable efforts.
   As part of his proposed $1.2 trillion budget for next year,
President Bush wants to spend $68 billion on research and
development, or R&amp;D _ the studies and experimentation that are at
the core of science.
   Billions more, spread throughout the budget and not totaled,
would be spent for scientific work that has progressed beyond the
R&amp;D stage, such as the space shuttle.
   More than $4 billion would be devoted to five science projects
alone: the space station, a study of climatic change, missions to
the moon and Mars, a giant atom smasher called the superconducting
super collider, and a study of human genes.
   ``Investment in research and development is a top priority for
an administration that believes in investing in the future,''
Bush's budget request said.
   But with congressional work on the fiscal 1991 budget just
beginning, Sasser and many of his colleagues are questioning
whether the government can afford long-term costly initiatives that
threaten to become more expensive each year.
   ``Exploring and uncovering the mysteries of the universe stirs
us all,'' Sasser said. ``But I am afraid we are looking at the
stars right now from a rather deep fiscal hole.''
   Federal spending on science is not large relative to the rest of
the budget. For example, the military will take close to $300
billion this year.
   Nor are federal science expenditures growing at an alarming
rate, compared to other accounts. Adjusted for inflation, they are
barely larger than in the late 1960s. Medicaid spending, meanwhile,
is expected to grow by 15 percent, to $40 billion, this year alone.
   But the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law is forcing Congress
and the White House to find new sources of savings every year,
making science vulnerable.
   Large parts of the budget such as Social Security are too
politically sensitive to be cut dramatically. Nor can the $176
billion in this year's interest payments on the national debt be
cut without causing the government to default.
   Despite pressure to reduce deficits, many people argue that the
United States can't afford to eliminate large-scale science
programs.
   Supporters make the same arguments that were heard in 1957 after
the Soviets launched their Sputnik satellite: The United States
must remain at the forefront of technology, and not just for
economic reasons.
   ``This country had a goal and a dream when we went to the moon.
What this country is looking for now is goals and dreams,'' said
Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee.
   ``One thing this country still has is an advantage in its
science and technology base,'' says Frank Press, president of the
National Academy of Sciences. ``From that point of view, the total
investment in science is justifiable.''
   But others worry about the trade-offs.
   ``Science is an unmet need, but it's competing against housing,
education, the human side of the ledger,'' says House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Still others complain that too many science spending decisions
are made by politicians interested primarily in jobs and other
economic rewards for their home districts.
   ``It's like everything else; people are getting re-elected by
delivering the bacon,'' says former Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
who until 1989 chaired the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that
oversees NASA spending.
   Congressional support for science is widespread, and rarely
breaks down along party lines. But to generalize, it has stronger
backing from conservatives than from liberals, who from time to
time try to shift some science spending into social programs.
   As with many areas of the budget, support for specific projects
tends to be strongest from those whose congressional committees
oversee the programs or whose districts will benefit from them.
Hence, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of Congress' most fervent
advocates of spending cuts, strongly supports the costly super
collider because it is to be built in his state.
   Many who question federal support for expensive science programs
say they soak up money that would be better spent for small
projects that involve basic science. That work, often conducted by
individual researchers, involves a search for basic knowledge
regardless of its potential application.
   For example, they note that this year, for the first time in a
decade, the number of research awards by the National Institutes of
Health will fall below 5,000.
   Money also is scarce because of the way the government spends
its research and development money. Of the 1990 $64 billion total,
only $24 billion will be for civilian projects. Nearly two-thirds _
$40 billion _ will go to military work, largely weapons testing
with little or no application to the rest of the economy.
   Adding pressure are the peculiarities of the federal budget
process, which pits programs against each other.
   The budget committees will make recommendations for spending
levels that are politically influential but not legally binding.
The appropriations committees make the final decisions.
   Their subcommittees have jurisdiction over seemingly random
groupings of programs. It is at that level that dollars are
distributed among competing demands.
   Rep. Robert Traxler, D-Mich., chairs the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees NASA, the National Science Foundation,
housing, veterans and environmental programs.
   ``What am I supposed to do for science?'' he asked. ``Take money
from the homeless?''

   Jockeying for federal science dollars is
intensifying as demands increase, but the money available remains
roughly constant.
   When inflation is considered, the government spends barely more
for research and development today than it did at the height of the
Apollo moon program in the late 1960s.
   Adding to the competition is the sheer number of participants
involved in distribution and pursuit of science funding: dozens of
congressional committees and federal agencies, thousands of private
companies and institutions, and an estimated 5.3 million American
scientists and engineers.
   When World War II ended, the government was spending less than
$1 billion annually on research and development, most of it for
atomic weapons work. Spending grew slowly until the Soviets orbited
the Sputnik satellite in 1957, provoking concern about the
competitiveness of American science and sparking the growth of the
U.S. space program.
   As a result, government science spending grew well into the
1960s, leveling off during the Vietnam War. Dollar amounts
increased with the energy crisis of the late 1970s and President
Reagan's defense buildup of the 1980s, but spending adjusted for
inflation changed little.
   President Bush is proposing $68 billion in science spending for
the next fiscal year, up about $4 billion from this year.
   Translated into 1982 dollars to even out the effects of
inflation, the government will spend the equivalent of $48.2
billion this year for research and development _ barely more than
the $46 billion it spent in 1967.
   But nearly two-thirds of the spending goes for military
research, mainly on weapons, making the competition for civilian
research and development money even more intense.
   Again using 1982 dollars, the government will spend $18.1
billion on civilian research and development in 1990 _ less than
the $22.4 billion spent in 1966.
   Today, 26 House and Senate committees are involved in science
policy and spending. Ninety-six federal agencies and agency
subdivisions play a role in research and development, according to
the National Science Foundation.
   But just five agencies spend 95 percent of the money: the
Pentagon, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Energy
Department, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the National Science Foundation, which distributes grants and keeps
track of federal science efforts.
   In 1988, 15 agencies accounted for more than 99 percent of
federal academic support for science. They distributed money to
2,769 universities and colleges, 46 offices of academic systems
such as state university headquarters, and 717 non-profit,
independent institutions such as hospitals.
   To conduct its own scientific work, ranging from the study of
AIDS to development of high-speed trains, the government employs
218,000 scientists and engineers, according to the science
foundation.
   Some work at the more than 700 national laboratories the
government either operates directly or pays other institutions to
run. On the large end of the scale are the 8,400 employees at the
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and Livermore,
Calif. At the other extreme are the 16 workers at the Kodiak
National Laboratory in Kodiak, Alaska, where shellfish are studied.
   In his proposed 1991 budget, President Bush is pressing for
annual installments for a number of major scientific initiatives
that will take years to complete.
   Six of the biggest, and their projected overall costs, are:
   _A $3 billion effort to map human genes in an effort to treat
genetic diseases and advance agriculture, medicine and other fields.
   _The $8 billion super collider, a circular atom-smasher that
will measure 54 miles around, about to be built in Texas. It will
be the world's most expensive scientific instrument.
   _The so-called mission to planet Earth, involving NASA and other
agencies, to study global change at a cost of at least $20 billion
over 20 years.
   _The $30 billion space station, scheduled for construction in
the mid-1990s.
   _A return by astronauts to the moon in the 1990s and a manned
mission to Mars early in the next century, which NASA says could
cost $541 billion.
   _The aerospace plane, considered part of the moon-Mars effort
but which could be developed independently. It would take off and
land like a conventional airplane yet reach speeds above 4,000 mph.
If approved, construction of two aircraft would begin in 1993, take
four to five years and cost more than $5 billion.

<HEAD>Happy Land Disaster Reveals the Darker Side of NYC Realty</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Distant from Manhattan's shining skyscrapers
lies the darker side of New York City real estate, a place where
buildings crumble from neglect, where drugs are dealt, where
unlicensed bars sometimes turn into infernos.
   The Happy Land social club in the Bronx, where 87 revelers were
killed March 25 in New York City's deadliest fire in 79 years, was
a firetrap like hundreds of other illegal clubs in poorer
neighborhoods. And the city knew it.
   But these bars are as profitable as they are dangerous, experts
say, and that is why they flourish in the shadows _ poorly
regulated, operated on the cheap, tolerated by landlords seeking
what cash they can find.
   ``You own a building. You can't rent it. All of a sudden a guy
comes along and offers you $2,000 a month for it,'' said Barry
Levites, a real estate manager and former president of the Bronx
borough's Board of Realtors. ``Ninety percent of the time, nobody
even asks what he wants it for.''
   That passes for a business ethic on the unglamorous side of the
block.
   ``There is a tendency to find things that you don't expect''
from tenants, said Morris Sopher, a Bronx owner listed as having
two illegal social clubs in his buildings. ``They may open a
grocery store up front. But then they make a partition 40 feet back
and they start having gatherings.''
   ``Say I rent to a guy and he starts doing illegal things,'' said
James J. Houlihan, another real estate owner with some holdings in
poorer areas. ``How am I supposed to be responsible for it?''
   But some landlords may share the blame. While some clubs are
concealed, many illegal nightspots operate openly, with a sign out
front and music blaring. Some are centers of drug traffic.
Prostitutes frequent others.
   ``A lot of landlords will rent to unsavory characters without
getting directly involved, without wanting to know what's going on,
making a lot of money and opening their eyes only when the police
come along,'' said Douglas Kellner, a veteran tenant rights lawyer.
``Then they self-righteously take steps to clean it up.''
   He said landlords in poor neighborhoods include slumlords who
collect what rental cash they can while allowing buildings to
deteriorate, small-time owners unschooled in building management,
and real estate companies that provide minimum service while
seeking the maximum profit.
   Perhaps the biggest owner is the city, which takes over
buildings for unpaid taxes. Police records say social clubs operate
even in some city-owned buildings _ by one estimate, more than 50.
   In some cases where private owners remain, ``the rents are
extortionate,'' said Jane Benedict, a leader of the Metropolitan
Council on Housing, a tenant rights group. ``But there's no place
else for the people to go.'' The city does not regulate commercial
rents.
   The Happy Land rented for $1,950 a month, easy money to recover
in a club charging a $5 entrance fee and $3 per drink. To maximize
profit, many clubs pour cheap booze from refilled bottles.
   ``Anybody who thinks that because a bottle says Dewar's he's
getting Dewar's ought to go to the hospital for a mental
examination,'' said Inspector Frank Biehler, commander of the
Police Department's Social Club Task Force.
   The Happy Land lacked a fire exit and first-floor sprinkler
system; once flames blocked the front door, there was no way out.
The city ordered the club closed in November 1988 for fire code
violations, and it apparently closed for a time, but then reopened.
   The city said it sent its vacate order to the building's owner,
Alex DiLorenzo III, and that a firefighter discussed the issue with
Morris Jaffe, a real estate manager who leased a block of buildings
including the Happy Land from DiLorenzo. Lawyers for DiLorenzo and
Jaffe did not return calls.
   DiLorenzo is part heir to one of the city's largest real estate
fortunes.
   Levites, the real estate manager, called it unusual for someone
of DiLorenzo's prominence to own property in impoverished areas.
``They can play the big game in Manhattan,'' he said. ``Why bother
with something like this?''
   More common are owners such as Sopher, who said he owns nearly
60 Bronx commercial buildings, and others who own just one or
several properties.
   Sopher said he never was notified by the city that it had found
illegal clubs in two of his buildings, and that he learned of it
only last week when reporters called. He said he would move to
evict them, but complained that court protections for tenants can
delay evictions a year or more.
   ``My responsibility is to come around, which I do, bother them,
harass them. I don't have any police powers. I can go to court, but
the courts are totally consumer and tenant oriented,'' he said.
``It's almost impossible to get out a bad tenant.''
   Sopher and his colleague also laid some of the blame for illegal
clubs on the city, which they said failed to enforce the vacate
orders that help rid them of unwanted tenants. Inspectors rarely
return, they said; police and firefighters never check up.
   Happy Land had a sign in front, complete with a smiling ``happy
face'' symbol. ``You're going to tell me the cops in the area
didn't know this was going on?'' Levites said. ``The Fire
Department didn't know what was going on? They didn't notice?
   ``Who's supposed to police these people? Well, the blame can go
all over.''

   They are an unlikely group of backroom
politicians: the rabbi of Belz, the rabbi of Gur and the venerable
Litvak, 93-year-old Rabbi Eliezer Menachem Schach.
   Israel's political system is tangled and these three leaders of
the Haredim _ ultra-Orthodox Jews _ have the power to decide who
will lead the next government.
   Although Israel is a Jewish state, rabbis seldom emerge as
political kingmakers. Outrage has been the most common reaction
among Israelis, who are overwhelmingly secular.
   Thousands of Israelis tuned in to a televised speech last week
by Rabbi Schach, a leader in two ultra-Orthodox parties.
   His factions and Agudat Israel, the third ultra-religious party,
hold a pivotal 13 seats in the 120-member Parliament. They can
determine whether Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, is able to
form a new coalition.
   Religious party leaders said for a week that Schach's speech
would be a political bombshell and break the parliamentary tie
between Labor and the right-wing Likud bloc of Yitzhak Shamir,
acting prime minister of a caretaker government.
   It was a political dud, however _ more of a sermon in which the
white-bearded rabbi, wearing the black hat of religious Jews,
literally wagged his finger and lectured Israel for ignoring Jewish
traditions.
   Many were angered by his criticism of the kibbutzim, or
collective farms, which led in the settlement of Israel and in
fighting its wars.
   Schach accused the kibbutzim of raising non-kosher pigs and
rabbits and of forgetting traditions that have kept Jews together
for 2,000 years. ``If there is a war, with what will they fight?''
he asked.
   Much of the resentment stemmed from the fact that many
ultra-Orthodox are non-Zionist and do not accept the state of
Israel. Their children often avoid army service, studying religion
into their late 20s or early 30s in yeshivas.
   ``I propose to whomever wants to look at the rabbits in the
kibbutzim that they also look at the cemeteries and count there how
many kibbutzniks were killed in the wars,'' said Raphael Eitan, a
former army chief of staff and right-wing politician.
   Yossi Sarid, head of the left-wing Citizens' Rights Movement,
said: ``I ask if there is somebody among us who in the next war
will do without the boys from the kibbutz and instead send the
yeshiva students?''
   Schach criticized the center-left Labor Party for its
``detachment'' from Jewish tradition and included Likud, its
conservative rival, in ``all the others ... that have no link to
Judaism.''
   The lack of a clear endorsement meant politicians on both sides
continued wooing the ultra-Orthodox parties, offering political
jobs and funds for yeshivas as enticements, and feeding the anger
of many Israelis.
   Parliament member Yigal Bibi of the National Religious Party,
which is not ultra-Orthodox, described the events as ``a sad moment
in the life of Israel.''
   ``The people have had enough,'' he said. ``It's as if we've
returned to the 18th century. ... The war of the Lithuanians and
the Hassidim has gone beyond any limit.''
   Bibi referred to the dispute between the Hassidim, Hebrew for
``pietists,'' who arose in Poland, and the Mitnaggedim, or
``opponents,'' who originated in Lithuania.
   Agudat Israel is a base for the Hassidim, who stress the
emotional side of Judaism. Rabbi Simha Alter, who lives in Israel
but has the title rabbi of Gur, in the Ukraine, is one of its
leaders.
   Rabbi Schach is a Litvak, or native of Lithuania. He is of the
Mitnaggedim sect, which was formed in reaction to the Hassidim and
emphasizes Talmudic scholarship.
   In his battle with Agudat, the rabbi helped create Shas and
Degel Hatorah, the two political groups he represents. His chief
ally in Degel Hatorah, or Torah Flag, is Rabbi Dov Rokeach, who has
the title rabbi of Belz, in the Ukraine.
   At the moment, the ancient and modern disputes of the
ultra-Orthodox keep Peres from lining up the 61 Parliament votes he
needs to form a government.
   Because Peres has a tentative promise of Agudat's five votes, he
is unlikely to get the support of the eight members who represent
Shas and Degel Hatorah.
   The irony of it is that Schach would seem Labor's natural ally.
   In his televised speech, the rabbi expressed willingness to give
up the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for
peace with the Palestinians who live there, a view Labor shares and
Likud rejects.
   One of Schach's allies, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, brought down
Shamir's government March 15. Yosef withdrew his backing from
Shamir when the prime minister refused compromises aimed at
starting peace talks with Palestinians.

   High-definition television, widely held to be the
``next wave'' in video technology, is coming. It won't be cheap and
it won't be here soon, but people at the nation's big broadcasting
convention want to catch the HDTV wave.
   ``HDTV is real, it's coming, and it's important for broadcasters
to focus on,'' Gary Shapiro of the Electronics Industry Association
told a roomful of broadcasters at National Association of
Broadcasters convention.
   Manufacturers' prototypes showed conventioneers the sharp-focus,
wide-screen format of the movie theater and the compact
disc-quality sound. But bringing that technological wizardry home
isn't going to be easy.
   The Federal Communications Commission must decide by 1993 which
of several competing technical proposals will best transmit HDTV,
and whether the nation should settle for a cheaper, ``sort-of''
high-definition TV.
   TV and video producers also have to crank out HDTV programs, and
TV networks, local stations, pay-TV services and cable companies
must decide how quickly they can upgrade their equipment to carry
HDTV signals.
   And viewers must decide whether they can afford it. Right now,
Sony's 28-inch HDTV color monitor costs about $30,000. Experts
think the initial price for the first consumer models will be about
$3,000.
   ``That $3,000 price point seems high, but of course, it will
come down,'' Shapiro said. ``It's time for broadcasters not to
break into hives when we talk about it.''
   As AM radio was eclipsed by FM stereo, he said, ``the failure to
get involved in HDTV could turn over-the-air broadcast into what AM
radio is now.''
   The cost of converting an entire TV station, or a network,
scares some industry observers, who label HDTV ``Huge Debt TV.''
One study estimates that it could cost a major-market TV station
$38 million to make the switch.
   Converting a network of studios and equipment could cost half a
billion dollars, said Michael J. Sherlock, president of operations
and technical services for NBC.
   HDTV signals cannot simply be sent in place of the current
standard. To ensure that TV sets don't turn obsolete overnight, the
FCC has determined that current TV transmission must continue.
   HDTV broadcasters will have to ``simulcast'' a separate,
high-definition signal on a second TV channel, which HDTV viewers
will turn to instead.
   The simulcast system means every TV station showing HDTV will
need a new antenna, and some may need new towers at a time when
many urban areas don't want any more of them.
   It all means a lot of money _ maybe too much, according to
Sherlock. ``We think it's real important to be able to have
something that's cost-effective for the consumer, and the
broadcaster, too,'' he said.
   In addition to five simulcast HDTV proposals, the FCC is
weighing three proposals for ``enhanced'' systems sometimes dubbed
``extended definition'' or EDTV.
   These systems are designed to improve current TV transmission by
30 percent or more, with more than 400 lines of resolution,
compared to the old system, which peaks in the 300s. The signal
could be received by conventional TVs, and wouldn't require a
second transmission channel.
   HDTV puts more than 1,000 lines of resolution on the TV screen.
   But the Advanced Television Research Consortium, which matches
NBC with the U.S. arms of France's Thomson S.A. and the Dutch N.V.
Philips, is pushing hard for its extended definition system, dubbed
Advanced Compatible Television.
   It would not require the second simulcast system, and thus would
cost broadcasters and consumers much less and could be up and
running a lot faster.
   Thomson's RCA prototype EDTV set also was on display, showing
Super Bowl highlights taped in extended definition.
   The FCC announced that it has no intention of adopting a midway
standard now and an HDTV standard later. It could still,
conceivably, approve one of each.

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Genghis Khan's Mongol warriors
swept south in the 13th century, even China's Great Wall could not
keep them out.
   Again, China is on guard against Mongolia, but the new forces of
democracy and nationalism bursting forth may prove just as hard to
keep out.
   ``There are grounds for China to worry; democracy is
infectious,'' said Lamjar, a pro-democracy activist. Like most
Mongolians, he uses just one name.
   Lamjar is a leader of the Social Democratic Movement, one of
several new opposition groups that have forced the ruling
Communists to initiate political reforms like their Soviet allies.
Recently, the party promised free elections.
   Chinese leaders, who used tanks and guns to put down their own
democracy movement in June 1989, already worry about the weakening
of the Soviet party and the collapse of those in Eastern Europe.
   Mongolia has brought the trend to China's border, and the 3.5
million ethnic Mongols in Chinese Inner Mongolia are a potentially
receptive audience. They already are exposed to a potent mix of
democratic ideas and Mongol pride via newspapers, radio broadcasts
and even pop music from Mongolia.
   One of Mongolia's biggest hits is a nationalist paean to the
``great emperor, Lord Genghis, our ancestor,'' which mourns, ``We
have become pitiable. Forgive us.''
   What impact all this will have on Mongols in China, whose
schooling stresses unity with the majority Han Chinese, is a
subject of great debate in Ulan Bator.
   Mongolians who travel frequently to Inner Mongolia said Beijing
clearly is worried. They said China has severely restricted travel
to Mongolia and has increased surveillance of its Mongol minority.
   At stake is the stability of Inner Mongolia and other border
regions populated by traditionally more restive minorities, the
Tibetans and Uygurs.
   ``Unrest is impossible,'' said a man with relatives in Inner
Mongolia, noting that Chinese now outnumber Mongols there.
   He and other cross-border travelers said, however, that China's
Mongols are far from assimilated, although many dress like Chinese
and speak Chinese.
   ``They always look to Outer Mongolia,'' an intellectual said.
``A Mongol is always a Mongol.''
   Reuniting the two Mongolias is not part of the public program of
the new opposition groups in Ulan Bator, despite the new
nationalist climate.
   ``In every Mongolian exists such a dream,'' an activist said,
``but to talk about it openly is dangerous.''
   For centuries, the only relationship between Mongolians and
Chinese was that of ruler and ruled.
   Genghis Khan's successors ruled China for a century. China later
invaded Mongolia, but the nomadic Mongols were always more
resistant to China's Confucian influence than other East Asian
peoples.
   They turned to the Soviet Union for help in gaining independence
under a Communist government in 1921. Inner Mongolia, with a
heavier Chinese presence, remained under Beijing's control.
   After China became Communist in 1949, the two countries briefly
were friends, but the Soviet Union split with China in the early
1960s and Mongolia did too.
   As late as 1983, Mongolia ordered 2,000 ethnic Chinese living in
Ulan Bator to work on state farms or return to their homeland. Most
left, and China protested the expulsions.
   In the past two years, Mongolia has followed the Soviet example
of improving relations with China. Border trade resumed in 1989 and
Chinese defense officials will visit Ulan Bator soon, said
Buyanbadrakh, head of the Foreign Ministry's China desk. A summit
meeting is planned in May.
   ``Every problem in relations with China is solved,''
Buyanbadrakh said.
   If Chinese leaders are concerned about Mongolia's turn toward
democracy, they have said nothing officially, he said, nor have
they halted previously scheduled official delegations.
   ``We have no policy to spread democracy across the border,'' the
official said. ``It will be best for China if it understands the
real situation in Mongolia.''
   Even so, China might find it uncomfortable to have a
non-Communist Mongolia on its northern border if free elections
remove the discredited ruling party.
   When Western governments criticized China's crackdown on student
pro-democracy demonstrators last June, Mongolia's Communist leaders
said it was an internal Chinese matter.
   If the Social Democrats had been in power, said Ulankhu, one of
the movement's leaders, ``we would have done the same as the United
States did.''

   Frustrated by widespread shortages and
crippling inflation, radical politicians in Iran want to make
``economic crimes'' such as hoarding and trading on the black
market capital offenses.
   But some observers believe the real goal of the campaign is to
scuttle the economic and political policies of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani, the leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, wants
improved relations with the West to secure badly needed investment
and advanced technology to revitalize Iran's battered economy.
   Mehdi Karrubi, Iran's radical parliament speaker, added his
voice to the debate with a speech in Tehran on Sunday.
   ``Those who are sucking the nation's blood should be decisively
dealt with,'' Karrubi told tens of thousands of Iranians in the
city's Imam Hussein Square, according to the Islamic Republic News
Agency.
   ``Unfortunately there has been no determined confrontation by
the government against economic terrorists,'' Tehran Radio quoted
him as saying.
   The reports, monitored in Nicosia, said Karrubi's address on one
of Tehran's main squares marked the 11th anniversary of a
referendum in which the nation voted overwhelmingly for an Islamic
government.
   Karrubi said the country still faces ``many difficulties''
following the August 1988 cease-fire that stopped Iran's eight-year
war with Iraq.
   While ``the people are sacrificing for the goals and values of
the revolution, some are hoarding foodstuffs and other essential
needs of the people,'' he declared.
   Karrubi joined a growing chorus of Iranian leaders and
newspapers demanding a crackdown on hoarders, black marketeers and
corrupt officials, fueling popular resentment over continued
hardship.
   Despite the end of the war, Iran has an annual inflation rate
officially pegged at 25 percent but unofficially believed to be
four times that.
   There are widespread shortages.
   Prices have far outstripped wages, factories are running at
about 40 percent of capacity, although that is believed to be
improving.
   The radicals' demands are widely seen as part of a campaign of
opposition to Rafsanjani. The anti-Western extremists consider his
political and economic policies a betrayal of the teachings of the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died of cancer in June.
   They has been sniping at Rafsanjani's strategy for months,
adding to the pressure on the president who is seeking to revive
the economy to ease the hardships of Iran's 55 million people over
the past decade of turmoil.
   Former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who was dropped
from the Cabinet by Rafsanjani in August, was elected to parliament
in December and has been organizing opposition to Rafsanjani in the
House.
   Karrubi declared that the ``economic terrorists'' should face
the death penalty on conviction by Islamic courts and said
parliament ``is prepared for any cooperation with the judiciary in
confronting economic terrorists.''
   He likened them to ``theomachists,'' or ``those who fight
against God.''
   The republic's 1979 constitution says theomachists should be
punished by hanging, crucifixion, exile, or cutting off the right
hand and left leg.
   The leader of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, said
on Feb. 19 that it will ``deal with greater force against those who
disrupt the economic affairs of the country, even if they're in
government establishements.''
   He demanded capital punishment for corruption and urged the
270-seat Majlis, or parliament, to approve legislation to that
effect.
   Karrubi said the Majlis had been preoccupied with debating
Rafsanjani's budget and five-year development plan in February.
   But he said: ``Let them bring whatever article they want to the
Majlis ... I'm certain the Majlis would vote with near-unaninmity
to open the way for the judiciary to ... give (the hoarders) their
just deserts.''
   Hoarders ``should know that they will be punished for exploiting
the people who are making great sacrifices,'' he said.

   Shining Path guerrillas stormed a village
intent on killing local political leaders but the townspeople
fought back with knives and guns, and 19 people died in the ensuing
battle, officials say.
   Police said about 100 of the Maoist-inspired guerrillas tried to

southeast of Lima, on Saturday.
   They said 12 peasants and seven guerrillas were killed in an
hour of fighting before the rebels fled.
   In another development in the decade-old insurgency that has
claimed more than 17,000 lives, two engineers with the state-owned
Agrarian Bank were killed Saturday by Shining Path guerrillas.
   The engineers, forced to leave their car, were shot to death
near Huaraz, 190 miles north of Lima.
   Peruvians go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president,
and the Shining Path has mounted a bombing and assassination
campaign to try to thwart the balloting.

   CLUJ-NAPOCA, Romania (AP) _ This Transylvanian city has four
names, which trace its ethnic and political history.
   To the Hungarians who ruled for centuries, it is Kolozsvar.
Germans, who built neat villages all around, called it Klausenburg.
To the Romanians who run it now, it is Cluj.
   The fourth name, Cluj-Napoca, incorporates the city's supposed
Latin name. It is the only one found on signposts and on maps of
the western region.
   Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator overthrown and
executed in December, imposed the hyphenated hybrid in 1966 as part
of his attempt to prove Romania had the strongest claim to
Transylvania. Hardly anyone uses it in everyday speech.
   Ceausescu's policies of destroying tradition and fanning
Romanian nationalism left a complex legacy in a region where, for
centuries, three nationalities have farmed, built and battled, made
peace and fought again.
   After a brief period of shared elation when he was deposed, the
approximately 5 million Romanians and 2 million Hungarians in
Transylvania remain deeply divided.
   For ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania, which borders Hungary,
the new freedom means trying to regain such fundamental rights as
education in their own language. Hungarian-language schools existed
for 400 years in Kolozsvar. Ceausescu closed the last two in 1984.
   In nearby Tirgu Mures, the medical school was predominantly
Hungarian for centuries. A strike last month by ethnic Hungarian
students, who demanded lectures in their own language, provoked a
violent Romanian reaction.
   At least six people were reported killed and 300 injured in
ethnic rioting that pitted ethnic Romanians in the city against
ethnic Hungarians.
   Eva Gimesyi is one of several intellectuals who say they are
trying to explain their education goals to Romanians, who suspect
ethnic Hungarians of seeking autonomy. She is a philology professor
at Cluj University.
   Gimesyi, fellow ethnic Hungarian Lajos Kantor and others publish
a journal called Bridge to disseminate their views.
   They concede it is an uphill task. Memories are long in the
Balkans.
   Romanians have not forgotten the excesses of Hungarian rule in
the 18th and 19th centuries, or the brief return to Transylvania of
Hungarian fascists during World War II.
   Traditions of tolerance that accompanied the ancient enmity have
all but disappeared in an urban landscape of drab houses and dirty
factories. Villages preserved for centuries as badges of national
pride have fallen into neglect.
   ``There is a very thin layer'' of Romanian intellectuals ``with
whom we have common aims to re-enter Europe,'' Gimesyi said in an
interview.
   She said most ethnic Romanians are ``ignorant of Hungarian
language and culture, discontent and ... lacking in political
culture.''
   She and Kantor believe the bulk of Romanians, for that reason,
could be susceptible to the nationalism of such groups as Vatra
Romaneasca (Romanian Hearth), which ethnic Romanians founded Feb. 8
in Tirgu Mures.
   Gimesyi and Kantor, mindful of the old intellectual dreams of
Transylvania as a melting pot that could be a model to Europe,
believe they and Romanians who share their views must try by win
converts by patient argument.
   Many Romanians instinctively distrust the ethnic Hungarians,
whose case is weakened by nationalist sentiment inside Hungary
itself.
   In Hungary, people remember the loss of Transylvania and other
territories as punishment for being the losing side in World War I.
   The emotional attachment to ``Erdely'' _ Hungarian for
Transylvania _ and Ceausescu's harassment of ethnic Hungarians
prompted Hungary, before the revolution, to lead international
condemnation of a Warsaw Pact ally.
   In 1988, Hungary took the unprecedented step of opening its
borders to refugees from Romania.
   Open nostalgia in Budapest for the beautiful mountains and
rolling meadows of Transylvania feeds Romanian suspicions about the
language debate.
   ``The claims of the Magyar minority are based on their
conception that Transylvania is separate from Greater Romania,''
said Iuliu Boila of the Cluj branch of the National Peasant Party,
a pre-World War II political group revived since the revolution.
``This is not true. We are one nation.''
   Long suppression of ethnic identity and Ceausescu's policy of
resettling Romanians from other parts of the country in
Transylvania reinforce Boila's argument.
   Communists ``didn't allow diversity to exist,'' Gimesyi said.
``They didn't give individuals the right to make themselves
distinct from others.''
   Kantor said: ``The 45 years of Communism had an irreversible,
bad influence.''
   Gimesyi's own heritage _ one grandmother ethnic German and the
other ethnic Romanian _ illustrates the delicate web of integration
spun in old Transylvania.
   One major change wrought on the region was the emigration of the
German minority that, for centuries, acted as a kind of buffer
between the Hungarians and Romanians.
   In the 1930s, about 600,000 Germans lived in Transylvania. There
were 380,000 in 1966, and now the number is just over 200,000.
   Emigration of ethnic Germans averaged about 12,000 a year under
Ceausescu, who made West Germany pay hard currency for each one.
   The bright, painted houses the Germans leave behind either fall
into ruin or are taken by a fast-growing Gypsy population that adds
a new element to Transylvania's ethnic mix.

<HEAD>New York Fire Revives Debate Over Mariel Boatlift</HEAD>

   The World War II-vintage barracks are
hollow and silent, but a 12-foot fence with razor-sharp wire still
surrounds the buildings where thousands of Cuban refugees began
their stay in the United States a decade ago.
   When Cuban President Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel _
and his prisons _ in 1980, about 14,000 of the 125,000 refugees who
came to the United States were sent to this southwestern Wisconsin
Army base for processing.
   One was Julio Gonzalez, the 36-year-old drifter charged last
week with torching an illegal New York City social club and killing
87 people.
   His arrest has revived the debate over the cost to the nation of
accepting the refugees who arrived on the shores of Florida in
boats and rafts in what was called the Freedom Flotilla.
   Duke Austin, an Immigration and Naturalization Service
spokesman, said about 2,600 Mariel Cubans are being held by the
INS; 4,000 others are serving prison time for for felonies
committed in the United States.
   ``I would say there is probably in excess of at least 12,000
that have been involved in criminal activity,'' he said.
   But Barbara Biebel, director of refugee, migration and Hispanic
services for the Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, said the criminal
involvement of the refugees has been exaggerated.
   ``Probably for every horror story like the New York firebombing,
there are so many success stories of people starting a family or a
business,'' she said.
   Darrell Neitzel, a civilian Fort McCoy employee who was in
charge of plumbing for the two-story barracks where the Cubans were
herded, remembered the refugees' fears.
   ``They were afraid about everything. They didn't know what was
going to happen to them next. They didn't know if there was going
to be a firing squad that was going to shoot them the next morning
or what,'' Neitzel said.
   Little is known about Gonzalez's activities at Fort McCoy,
including how long he was there.
   ``He never tried to become a citizen,'' Austin said. ``We had
never had any problems with him in the 10 years he has been here.''
   About 80,000 of the 125,000 Mariel refugees have become U.S.
citizens, Austin said.
   Most of the Cubans processed through Fort McCoy and detention
centers elsewhere in the nation eventually left for cities with
larger Hispanic communities such as Miami and New York.
   Jesus Labrador, 48, stayed, moving just 35 miles away from the
Army installation to La Crosse.
   Labrador, who spent two months at Fort McCoy, went to a trade
school, learned English and carpentry and said he did fine until he
stumbled in 1986 when he was convicted of selling cocaine and spent
two years in prison.
   Today, Labrador works a $4-an-hour job with a small company that
makes furniture.
   ``I have my house, my woman. ... I like it here. I love this
city,'' he said.
   Other refugees have not fared as well. Since 1985, the United
States has returned 375 refugees to Cuba, including 40 who never
were released during their time in the United States, Austin said.
   Even a decade after the boatlift, refugees involved in criminal
cases still command sensational news media coverage.
   Andres P. Montelier, 27, was arrested in January and charged
with murder in the stabbing and beating death of an elderly
Milwaukee woman, whose body was found with a large ``M'' engraved
in the flesh. Montelier is awaiting trial.
   Lene Cespedes-Torres was convicted of murder shortly after his
acceptance in the United States. One month after a background check
at Fort McCoy, he was released into the custody of a family in
nearby Tomah. A month later, he was arrested for strangling the
woman who agreed to sponsor him in the United States.
Cespedes-Torres is serving a life term in prison.
   Immigration officials estimate the total cost to U.S. taxpayers
for INS services and justice for the Mariel refugees easily exceeds
$1 billion.
   ``I don't know how you weigh the advantages and disadvantages,''
Austin said. ``Certainly, there were a lot of good people.
Certainly, there has been an over-characterization of the boat
people as a bunch of criminals and misfits.
   ``But there was an element in there that was extremely expensive
to the American public.''

   Whoopi Goldberg doesn't see moving from the
stage and screen to a situation comedy as a step down.
   ``As a girl from the projects, I'm not at all disappointed in
the way things are going. This is what I've always dreamed about.
And I'm still here, which is the phenomenal thing,'' the comedian
said in the April 9 issue of People magazine.
   Goldberg, who went from an acclaimed one-woman Broadway show to
the lead in Steven Spielberg's movie ``The Color Purple,'' stars
with Jean Stapleton in ``Bagdad Cafe'' on CBS.
   ``One thing I'm not is a flash in the pan,'' Goldberg said. ``I
have not done anything I'm ashamed of. Things haven't always turned
out the way I wanted, but I did the best job I could. They (the
critics) built Whoopi's image. I didn't.''

   Singer Jackson Browne says his relationship with
girlfriend Daryl Hannah is intact despite reports linking her to
John F. Kennedy Jr.
   ``The stories just aren't true. We haven't broken up. Daryl and
I are still together,'' People magazine quoted Browne as saying in
its April 9 issue.
   Browne broke his silence about his relationship with the
actress, who appeared in ``Wall Street'' and ``Splash,'' at a
benefit party in West Hollywood for Central American refugees.
   ``I've never spoken about it publicly,'' he said, ``which is why
I have no recourse when something is written about her.''

<HEAD>Angola Dispute Lingering Vestige of the Cold War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A highly paid army of lobbyists and lawyers is
fighting one of the last battles of the Cold War, an intense
struggle to influence U.S. policy in the obscure African country of
Angola.
   It is one of the last skirmishes left for the United States and
Soviet Union. Neither is willing to abandon its allies in Angola,
but neither is either side willing to let the civil war there hold
up overall improvements in their relationship.
   While the Bush administration's approach is low key,
conservatives in Washington have adopted a highly visible stance.
   ``A key test of whether the Soviets have in fact changed their
imperial ambitions is Soviet behavior'' in Angola, according to a
half-page ad in The New York Times that was paid for by the
International Security Council, a conservative think tank.
   With the Marxist Sandinistas removed from power in Nicaragua and
the Soviets gone from Afghanistan, conservatives are fast running
out of opponents. ``It's almost their last cause,'' said Dimitri
Simes, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
   To counter the conservatives' lobby, the Soviet-backed
government of Angola recently hired the legal firm of Washington,
Perito and Dubuc for $800,000 a year to lobby. Two other firms also
represent its interests at an annual cost of $350,000.
   Angola wants the United States to grant it diplomatic
recognition, to stop arming the rebels and to bring them to peace
talks. U.S. efforts to arrange peace talks have stalled since last
summer and fighting has intensified in recent weeks.
   But while Angola has made some recent advances against the
rebels in the battlefield, in Washington its enemy remains
formidable.
   The Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the
guerrilla organization led by Jonas Savimbi, has been fighting the
government for almost 15 years.
   According to public records, the cost of maintaining UNITA's
office in Washington comes to $800,000 a year. In addition, UNITA
retains the services of one of the city's most powerful lobbying
firms _ Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelley _ at a cost of $900,000
annually.
   Black Manafort is closely knit to the Bush administration
through its partners' political affiliation, and UNITA hired
another lobbyist recently _ Robert Keefe _ primarily for his
contacts in the Democratic Party.
   There is little question that UNITA has been far more effective
than the Angolan government at Washington lobbying. UNITA has
maintained its influence despite losing one of its rallying cries _
the presence of Cuban troops that supported the government. Under
an agreement signed in 1988 with Soviet and U.S. support, Cuba is
pulling its 50,000 soldiers out according to schedule. The pullout
ends next year.
   But the Soviets are still giving Angola $800 million annually in
weapons, and support for UNITA on Capitol Hill remains solid among
conservatives and moderate Democrats.
   Savimbi, the rebel leader, has made numerous trips to
Washington. Supporters of the charismatic leader say he favors
democracy in Angola, while President Jose Eduardo dos Santos wants
a one-party state.
   Liberals in Congress, led by Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., accuse
Savimbi of being an opportunist and tyrant. They point to economic
reforms adopted by dos Santos, to his call for elections and to his
overwhelming acceptance by the international community _ the United
States and South Africa are the only countries that do not
recognize Angola's government.
   But their voices frequently are drowned out.
   Despite U.S. differences with the Angolan government, the United
States is Angola's biggest trading partner. U.S. companies pump oil
in Angola's northwestern Cabinda province, and New York businessman
Maurice Tempelsman has a contract to export $20 million worth of
Angolan diamonds a year.
   But U.S. businesses have kept a low profile, partly out of
safety concerns in the war-torn country and partly out of
reluctance to tangle with the powerful pro-UNITA lobby in
Washington.
   When the business community clashed with UNITA several years
ago, Congress adopted a bill banning American companies from
writing off taxes they pay the Angolan government.

   Soviet defector Alexander Ushakov outwitted
two carloads of KGB gumshoes to make a daring escape to the West
six years ago. Now he's plotting another humiliation for the Soviet
secret police.
   Ushakov says he's suing the KGB.
   The former Soviet navy commander plans to haul his former
tormenters into court _ possibly before an international tribunal
in London _ to recover books, manuscripts and other documents
seized by KGB agents during a raid on his wife's apartment in
Odessa in 1984.
   Ushakov is seeking not only the return of his anti-communist
writings, but monetary damages for the emotional suffering he and
his wife, Irina, endured.
   ``I'm talking about millions,'' he said, sipping black Turkish
coffee in his suburban Arlington, Va., apartment. ``In hard
currency, of course. I don't need their rubles.''
   Ushakov, 43, now a Russian language instructor, recalled how he
became the target of a two-year KGB manhunt after he published
underground criticism of the Marxist-Leninist system while teaching
at the Soviet naval academy at Odessa on the Black Sea.
   Tipped of his imminent arrest on charges that carry an automatic
sentence of 12 years in the gulag, Ushakov said goodbye to his
bride, who gave him cash and jewelry and told him, ``Better you are
alive in the West than dead in Siberia.''
   At midnight on April Fool's Day, 1984, he eluded nearly a dozen
KGB agents surrounding his apartment and began a 40-day flight to
freedom by taxi, bus, train and a treacherous climb over the
snow-swept Caucasus Mountains into Turkey under the machine guns of
circling Soviet helicopters.
   Meanwhile, he said, his wife was ``exposed to deadly risk'' for
nearly four years. Finally, after an 11-day hunger strike and an
appeal to Nancy Reagan for help, Irina was given a passport and
visa on Christmas Eve 1987 and flew to Washington the next day. She
was the first wife of a ``border crosser'' to be reunited with her
husband.
   Ushakov described his dramatic escape in a book titled ``In the
Gunsight of the KGB,'' published last year by Alfred A. Knopf. Now
he has the KGB in his own gunsight.
   According to experts in international law, Ushakov would be the
first person ever to sue the KGB. Ushakov is confident he'll win,
but the experts say the odds are overwhelmingly against him.
   Already, Ushakov is learning that it won't be easy. When he
served his legal papers at the Soviet Embassy last September, he
said, ``They were shocked. They didn't know what to do.''
   After six weeks of silence, the embassy responded with a
procedural complaint: Ushakov had failed to sign the $25 money
order required for processing his civil petition.
   ``They were stalling for time,'' he said. ``They were playing
games with us.''
   Finally, the embassy responded in a Feb. 22 letter stating that
the confiscated literature was being held as evidence in the
``criminal action'' against Ushakov.
   Ushakov was heartened. ``That letter was a good sign,'' he said.
``It's a two-way road now. It's progress. Before Gorbachev, such
letters from a lawyer simply wouldn't be answered. They would have
disappeared in a black hole.''
   Ushakov immediately began preparing for a court battle against
the KGB sometime next year.
   He claims to have found an international arbitration panel in
London to hear his case, although legal authorities say there isn't
a court in the world with jurisdiction over such a dispute _ even
if the Soviets agree to join the litigation.
   ``He's hallucinating if he thinks he can find a tribunal to
handle his claim,'' said Bruce Fein, a Washington expert on
international law. ``This is utterly fantastical.''
   Dr. Adda Bozeman, an expert on Soviet affairs and international
law at Sarah Lawrence College in New York, said Ushakov's lawsuit
doesn't stand a chance in court.
   ``No one in Soviet government circles, including the KGB, is
subject to the law, and the Soviet Union does not recognize
property rights of its citizens,'' she said.
   Ushakov's lawyer, Myron Mintz, said he is reviewing all possible
legal avenues for Ushakov but added, ``I don't think one can sue
the KGB.''
   Ushakov is undeterred.
   ``Nobody has dared do this because everyone was afraid of the
vengeance of the KGB,'' he said. ``If such a trial is held, I am
going to win. I will open the door for hundreds of writers who were
jailed and whose rights were violated.''

<HEAD>Organizers Using Earth Day to Raise Consciousness About
Environment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A worldwide celebration of the environment
will envelop this battered and polluted planet this month, and by
all accounts Earth Day '90 will dwarf its namesake of two decades
ago.
   Even corporate America wants to get involved.
   Planning for the environmental extravaganza has been in the
works for more than a year. President Bush has proclaimed April 22
Earth Day, and governors and mayors across the country are issuing
similar proclamations.
   That spring Sunday comes exactly 20 year after Earth Day '70
ushered in the modern environmental movement.
   Denis Hayes, a California lawyer who was instrumental in the
first Earth Day activities and is chairman of Earth Day 1990, says
he wants this year's event to be more than a birthday party.
   The goal is ``to galvanize a new outpouring of public support
for environmental values'' and grab the attention of ``a new
generation of activists in the environmental struggle'' of the
coming decade and the next century, he says.
   Earth Day 1990, the corporate entity that is coordinating Earth
Day activities, has refused sponsorship from most corporations. And
the Environmental Protection Agency, reacting to complaints from
environmentalists, scrapped plans for an industry-financed $1
million ``Earthfest'' on the National Mall to publicize corporate
environmental initiatives.
   ``There's a legitimate argument going on,'' says Tina Hobson,
executive director of Renew America, a group that has both business
and environmental ties. ``Who has the right to participate in Earth
Day? Only those who are clean environmentally ... or anyone? I take
the side that everyone is entitled to participate.''
   Christina Desser, executive director of Earth Day 1990,
responds: ``We made a decision early on that Earth Day was a day
for people, not a day for corporate publicity or corporate
rehabilitation.'' She says many companies may promote
environmentally sound programs on the one hand, but at the same
time fight to defeat environmental legislation or continue to be a
major polluter.
   Jeremy Rifkin, who for years has been among the most militant of
environmentalists, is more critical. ``The corporations are
attempting to steamroll and take over Earth Day to sell products
and to cash in,'' he maintains.
   Organizers say there will be events in 130 countries, ranging
from simple nature walks and teach-ins to massive outdoor rallies.
   His group, working with a budget of $3 million, has amassed a
130-page calendar of events planned for Earth Day.
   Among them:
   _Elementary school students in Arizona will plant hundreds of
trees.
   _Many communities will close streets to motorized traffic and
open them to bicyclists.
   _Operators of chemical plants will hold open houses.
   _The elephants at the National Zoo in Washington will crush
aluminum cans to promote recycling.
   A rival group _ called Earth Day '20 _ has organized
representatives of the United States, Soviet Union and China for a
climb up Mount Everest to dramatize the need for international
cooperation in dealing with today's global environmental problems.
   Gaylord Nelson, a former senator who founded the first Earth
Day, said this year's celebration will likely be ``the largest
grassroots demonstration in history.''
   Nelson, a longtime conservationist who now is counselor to the
Wilderness Society, says the goal of Earth Day '90 should be to
create such a stir that it ``shakes the political leadership of the
world out of its lethargy'' and forces it to deal with the globe's
environmental problems.
   Ruth Caplan, who as a mother of two young children participated
in the 1970 Earth Day celebration, said the momentum created by the
first Earth Day has slowed.
   ``We must have activism in the 1990s if we are to prevent
disaster in the next century,'' says Ms. Caplan, now executive
director of the Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington-based
environmental group.
   Many Fortune 500 companies are planning events, often in
conjunction with their employees or local community leaders, to
mark April 22 as a day for the environment, and many trade groups
have been advising their members how to play up environmental
issues on both the federal and local level.
   The enthusiasm has not grabbed everyone.
   ``What Earth Day is going to be is an anti-technology,
anti-business, anti-Western civilization orgy by people who have no
serious concern about environmental objectives,'' complains Fred
Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court to Consider California Death Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Robert Alton Harris waited in a special
death row cell for word from the U.S. Supreme Court today on
whether it would let California's first execution in 23 years go
forward on Tuesday.
   The court was to consider the case today after defense lawyers
filed papers Sunday asking the justices to review whether Harris
had adequate psychiatric assistance at his 1978 trial for abducting
and murdering two teen-agers.
   Harris, 37, had been scheduled to go to the gas chamber early
Tuesday, but a federal appeals judge issued a stay of execution
Friday. He said the psychiatric questions raised by the defense
were worthy of review.
   Prosecutors then went to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to lift
the stay.
   Opponents of the death penalty continued their vigil outside San
Quentin prison Sunday, and a small crowd held a morning prayer
service at the foot of the huge cross in San Francisco, where a
full-size cardboard model of the gas chamber was erected.
   California's last execution was in 1967, when Aaron Mitchell was
put to death for the murder of a Sacramento policeman.
   Opponents of capital punishment say Harris' execution could open
the floodgates on the death penalty.
   In their attempt to save Harris' life, lawyers argued that
Harris did not receive adequate psychiatric evaluation and that new
evidence, including exposure to alcohol before birth, suggested he
may have mental disorders.
   On Friday, Judge John Noonan of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals granted a stay, saying more study of Harris' mental
condition may be needed.
   But prosecutors argued that Noonan had misread a 1985 high court
ruling saying defendants have the right to competent psychiatric
counsel.
   If Noonan's ruling is allowed to stand, prosecutors fear the
criminal appeals system would grind to a halt as defense lawyers
``go shopping'' for psychiatrists willing to disagree with earlier
diagnoses.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: New Majority Leader Goes to the Mat With Byrd _
And Wins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has
passed a test no other majority leader ever had to take: He squared
off against his predecessor and won.
   The Maine Democrat, in his second year as majority leader, had
proven himself a strong partisan warrior. Most notable last year
was his success in defeating President Bush's proposed capital
gains tax cut, which Democrats said would mostly benefit the
wealthy.
   But until last week, there was still a nagging doubt about
Mitchell's command of the Senate's institutional powers. That doubt
was personified by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.
   Byrd preceded Mitchell as Democratic leader. He is the only
senator ever to relinquish the majority leader's job and stay in
the Senate. He's now Senate president pro tempore, third in line to
the presidency, and chairman of the almighty Senate Appropriations
Committee.
   When Byrd ran for re-election in 1988, he said he was giving up
the majority leader's job so he could concentrate on doing more for
West Virginia.
   That promise eventually put him on a collision course with
Mitchell as the new leader worked to wrap up the first major
revision of the nation's air pollution laws in 15 years.
   Byrd for years worked against clean air legislation because it
would cost thousands of coal miners their jobs. He was convinced to
support the newest version _ an intricately compromised solution _
but he still wanted an amendment to provide a $500 million package
of special unemployment and retraining benefits for coal miners who
would be thrown out of work.
   Labor groups and clean air activists endorsed the Byrd
amendment, but the White House threatened a veto of the bill if
Byrd won. Mitchell was thrown into the position of going against
Byrd to save the bill.
   For two weeks the tension in the Capitol increased as the
personal stakes mounted. In a dramatic climax, Mitchell prevailed
Thursday on a 50-49 vote.
   ``This was his first real test ... to show he could knock heads
together and make things happen,'' said Norman Ornstein, a
congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
   ``It was an important vote for him as majority leader to be able
to put together a majority even though it was razor thin,'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
   Mitchell can expect a far more comfortable margin this week when
the Senate plans its final vote on the clean air bill.
   For Byrd and the miners, it was a sour defeat. But while the
vote may go far to boost Mitchell's power rating, it probably won't
do much to tarnish Byrd's image and power.
   Tough last-minute lobbying from President Bush and help from
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., were needed for Mitchell
to defeat Byrd.
   More than two-thirds of the Senate's 55 Democrats sided with the
former leader over the current one and more than that thought Byrd
was right on the merits.
   ``If this were not a deal buster, if it would not kill the bill,
I would vote with (Byrd),'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who was
swayed to side with Mitchell by a last-minute telephone call from
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   After the vote, Byrd avoided criticizing Mitchell and gave
credit to the White House for swinging votes. ``I have no regrets,
no recriminations,'' said Byrd, who can try to help the miners
later with other legislation.
   Byrd said three of his colleagues said they would vote with him,
but did not when it came down to the crunch. He'll remember who
they are. And as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he'll
have plenty of chance for revenge, if he so desires, when those
senators seek money for projects in their states.
   As for Mitchell, he still can expect Byrd's help in the future.
Byrd knows that a majority leader must sometimes take stands and
stick by them even when many in his own party think he's wrong.
   ``Byrd's not going to go away. He's got his own power and you
can't ignore it,'' said a top Senate aide after the vote. Mitchell
and Byrd ``need each other,'' the aide said.

   After a two-year delay, construction is about

   The privately financed wood and glass building is expected to be

   ``I have staked it out and we are ready to go,'' said Plummer, a
semiretired Chambersburg, Pa., building contractor.
   He said earth moving would start this week.
   Plummer, immediate past president of the National Lay Leaders
Association of the United Methodist Church, first announced plans
for the chapel early in 1988.
   At that time, he said the board hoped to start construction in a
few months and have the building ready before former President
Reagan left office in January 1989.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, took part in ground breaking
ceremonies for the chapel on July 2, 1988. At that time, the White
House said it was scheduled for completion early in 1989.
   Plummer said the main reason for the delay was that funds have
not come in as rapidly as he anticipated.
   Now, however, he said that between $850,000 and $900,000 of the
$1 million goal has been raised or pledged. He said this enabled
the board to give the Navy, which runs Camp David, the surety bond
it required before construction could begin.
   ``I agree with that,'' he said. ``We didn't want to get the
building half up and then stop on it. Now there is no question we
are going to be building it this summer.''
   Plummer said fundraising accelerated after the original
five-member board, dominated by Protestant church officials, was
expanded. The present 15-member board includes leaders of Jewish,
Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox faiths.
   Sean Walsh, a staff assistant in the White House press office,
said President Bush now attends religious services in an auditorium
at Hickory Lodge, one of the camp buildings, when he is at Camp
David on Sundays.
   Other presidents also have either joined Navy personnel at
services at the camp or visited nearby churches when they used the
presidential retreat.
   Nancy Reagan, who gave one of the first contributions to the
chapel fund, a check for $1,000, wrote in her book, ``My Turn,''
that it ``will be nice for the men stationed there, and for the
president, whoever he is.''
   Mrs. Reagan said that after her husband was wounded in an
assassination attempt in 1981 ``the increased security measures
made it virtually impossible for us to go to church without causing
an enormous disruption.'' The Reagans have resumed attendance at
Bel Air Presbyterian Church since returning to Los Angeles.
   Plummer said he first visited the camp as a Boy Scout and a
Scout leader before it was taken over as a presidential retreat by
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942. He later did construction work there
during several administrations.

<HEAD>House Armed Services Chairman Trying More Combative Style</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Les Aspin, whose credentials as a Democrat at
times are suspect among his colleagues, is keeping peace in his
House Armed Services Committee with a new, more combative style.
   ``Politically he's keeping the administration in check, the
Democrats in check and the budget committee in check,'' observes
Republican Rep. John Rowland of Connecticut, a member of the Armed
Services panel.
   Aspin fired the first shot at the White House earlier this year
when he rejected the Bush administration's attempt to shift
Pentagon funds to military personnel accounts to avoid massive
layoffs.
   President Bush had a chance to exempt the personnel accounts
from the budget-cutting law last August, but decided against it.
Pentagon officials said they did not propose the exemption because
they assumed Congress would grant them the authority to transfer
the funds.
   ``Budget brinkmanship,'' Aspin said of the administration's
action in a letter earlier this week.
   The Wisconsin Democrat also has been highly critical of Bush's
$307 billion fiscal 1991 defense budget _ a military blueprint that
cuts some conventional programs but calls for increasing funds for
strategic weapons.
   Aspin believes the budget fails to reflect the rapid changes in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   All this comes from a Democrat whose hold on the chairmanship
appeared tenuous just one year ago.
   Aspin angered his colleagues then by urging them to accept
Cheney's fiscal 1990 defense budget _ but when the House approved a
bill that cut Bush's strategic programs, he referred to the
legislation as a ``Michael Dukakis'' budget.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior committee member,
says the chairman has ``got a better pulse on it this time.''
   Aspin points to a series of events that he says made 1989 the
transition year for defense, including the increase in warning time
for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe and the intelligence
community's confirmation that the Soviet Union is reducing its
troops consistent with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's December
1988 announcement.
   In addition, there were Moscow's concessions in U.S.-Soviet
talks to reduce conventional arms and the collapse of the Warsaw
Pact as a military alliance.
   Having adopted those arguments for cutting Bush's budget, Aspin
then chose witnesses for his hearings who would make the same
points.
   First was CIA Director William Webster, who said the changes in
the Soviet Union will be difficult to reverse _ a contradiction of
statements by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Cheney bristled at Webster's comments, saying the testimony
``was not helpful'' to Bush's policies.
   Aspin also discussed a classified report and said the Joint
Chiefs had concluded that the United States and its allies could
fight and hold off the Soviet Union in Europe without resorting to
nuclear weapons.
   Aspin said Thursday that he plans to hold hearings on the
disintegration of the Soviet army, saying he was ``building toward
making a case to cut the Cheney budget.''
   Issues irking members of Congress include Cheney's candidates
for base closings, which drew charges of partisanship, the
Pentagon's request for authority to shift funds, deferral of funds
for pet congressional projects, and proposals for funding the aid
package for Nicaragua.
   The Nicaragua aid package would be partially funded by closing
some of the military construction projects at bases on Cheney's
list of proposed base closures.
   A senior member of the panel, Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., said
Aspin has a ``responsibility to fill the policy void this year.''
   ``If he doesn't move and we don't move, we're wasting a valuable
opportunity,'' McCurdy said.

<HEAD>Census Questions: Why They Ask All That Stuff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Why do they want to know all that stuff,
anyway?
   That's the question on millions of lips now that most Americans
have sent in their Census forms. But government officials say
there's a reason for the questions they're asking.
   The Census has grown from its original intention of counting the
population so seats in the House of Representatives can be
distributed among the states.
   Knowing that the nation was going to be counted every 10 years,
officials couldn't resist the urge to ask some questions. And once
the questions were being asked, officials started using the answers
to design social programs and distribute money.
   ``In many respects the Census is an index to our quality of
life,'' said John G. Keane, dean of the business school at Notre
Dame University and former head of the Census Bureau. ``The Census
shows us anew where our nation hurts and needs help. ... Recite the
national agenda and we realize how its resolution is directly or
indirectly rooted in Census data.''
   Nonetheless, each Census finds opposition to answering the
detailed questions, evidenced this year by resistance from the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Libertarian Party.
   ``They already know too much about the citizens,'' complained
Leslie Williams of the Vermont ACLU, who objected to questions
about household relationships, whether a home has complete plumbing
and whether anyone in a home is disabled.
   The Libertarian Party urges that answering the Census be made
voluntary. It is encouraging people to send in cards with their
Census forms stating either that they refuse to cooperate, are
doing so under threat or law or will only answer some questions.
   Census officials point out that the law requires people to
answer the Census, although prosecutions rarely occur.
   The more detailed questions on the long form _ sent to one
family in six _ are necessary, the bureau said.
   In fiscal 1988 there were 82 federal programs that allocated
$38.7 billion in money and other assistance based on Census
information. The programs are based not just on the number of
people, but who they are, their ages and incomes, jobs and
relationships to one another.
   The Transportation Department topped the list at $16.6 billion,
the vast majority of it highway planning and construction money
distributed according to Census results. The Education Department
hands out $7 billion based on Census figures.
   The $5.5 billion from the Department of Health and Human
Services helps illustrate changes in social trends.
   The agency used Census population information to distribute $26
million to aid runaway and homeless youths, $269 million for
services for the aging, $345 million for nutrition programs for the
elderly and $239 million for child welfare programs.
   Census population data provides statistical proof when city
officials apply for money to establish day care centers.
   Racial and ethnic information can be used to determine if
communities comply with voting rights laws. For example, minority
residents of a city could use Census data in a suit seeking to
redistrict local city council seats to provide more balanced
representation.
   During a severe summer heat wave, officials in St. Louis, Mo.,
used census data to locate areas with large numbers of elderly
residents. City workers then went door to door, telling the elderly
about cooling centers where they could go for relief.
   Outside the government, Big Brothers of America has used census
information on the characteristics of city populations to estimate
where it might best find volunteers for its programs to help youths.
   In Newport News, Va., a church official used age data in
planning a new church building. A high proportion of elderly in the
area resulted in a decision to build a one-story structure instead
of two.
   Many businesses have become avid users of census information,
using it to design products and services to specific audiences,
locate stores and plan for future growth.

<HEAD>Saudi Recipe for Grain Self-Sufficiency: Spend Big Bucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No wish list of American farmers comes even
close to the incredible saga of how Saudi Arabia turned from a
wheat importer to an exporter in a single decade.
   All it took was a decision, big oil revenues and some
fantastically high farm subsidies, says Agriculture Department
economist John Parker.
   In 1980, Saudi Arabia decided to become self-sufficient in wheat
by offering domestic producers $1,032 per metric ton, or about $28
per bushel. At that time, Parker said, U.S. wheat was selling on
the world market for $175 per ton, or $4.78 per bushel.
   The result was startling, he said. Saudi wheat production
doubled in 1982 and nearly doubled again in 1983. By 1984, Saudi
Arabia was self-sufficient in wheat.
   ``Surprised at the rapid gains, Saudi officials reduced the
price by half in 1984,'' Parker said. ``But $530 per ton was still
a very rewarding figure, and production continued to climb.''
   Then planners in Riyadh, the capital, tried to encourage farmers
to shift from wheat to less-profitable barley. Those efforts
fizzled last year when Saudi farmers harvested a record wheat crop
of 3.1 million tons.
   Exports, meanwhile, rose to 2.4 million tons in 1987-88, more
than double the level of the previous year. But Parker said USDA is
forecasting some decline in those exports for 1989-90.
   Last year, he said, wheat accounted for about $310 million of
Saudi Arabia's $400 million in agricultural exports.
   As a key member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia
ships about 200,000 tons of wheat to other council members: Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman. Parker said the
Saudis lose about $300 per ton on those shipments.
   Other Mideast countries get Saudi wheat, including Jordan and
Turkey, which received 200,000 tons last year. Previously, Turkey
was the Mideast wheat leader but has suffered from drought.
   Parker, writing in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said Saudi wheat also goes to Indonesia, China, the
Soviet Union, Portugal, Norway, the United Kingdom and Colombia.
   Despite the government's price cuts, domestic wheat prices and
production subsidies are still high enough to allow Saudi farmers
and investors to afford the best imported U.S. seed, farm tractors,
combines and irrigation systems, he said.
   ``Alarm at the depletion of underground water reserves,
especially near Riyadh, has not yet stopped the wheat production
boom,'' Parker said. ``Some farms still have land area to develop,
although new licenses were prohibited 18 months ago.''
   The concern about water reserves helped prompt the government's
reduced wheat price guarantees and curtailing some of the other
subsidies.
   ``But removing the seed subsidy and cutting the price still left
a hefty profit margin,'' Parker said. ``Many Saudi farmers earn a
profit of $600 per acre, compared with $60 to $80 earned by U.S.
farmers.''
   Parker noted that despite the program's cost of more than $1
billion annually, the Saudis' main objective _ self-sufficiency _
has been achieved. Overall, the country's dependency on net food
imports has been reduced to about 50 percent from 87 percent in
1980.
   During the oil embargo of 1973-73, when Saudi Arabia and other
petroleum exporters sent prices soaring, there was some talk in
international trade policy circles of linking the price of oil to
the price of wheat.
   ``Now, this is very unlikely to happen because Saudi Arabia is
no longer a wheat importer,'' Parker said.

   Another record for exports of wood products
was set last year, with Japan accounting for nearly half of the
total 1989 value, according to an annual report by the Agriculture
Department.
   In all, slightly more than $6 billion worth of solid wood
products were exported last year, a 14 percent increase from 1988,
said the report by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Hardwood sales rose 23 percent to more than $1.2 billion, and
the value of softwood products increased 9 percent to $4.1 billion.
Other products made up the remainder.
   Japan, the biggest customer of U.S. solid wood products, boosted
its imports 27 percent to $2.8 billion. Other major buyers included
Canada, $645 million; South Korea, $354 million; United Kingdom,
$233 million; and Mexico, $224 million.
   Softwood logs were the largest seller at more than $2.1 billion,
with Japan accounting for $1.6 billion of the total. Softwood
lumber was next at $1.39 billion.

   There are more than 1 billion head of cattle
and buffalo in the major livestock countries, according to
Agriculture Department statisticians.
   The most current estimates published by the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service show the U.S. cattle herd at 99.3 million
head. Brazil's is slightly larger at 100.3 million, and China's is
101.4 million. The Soviet Union was shown at 118.3 million.
   All are dwarfed by India's cattle and buffalo inventory,
estimated in 1990 at 273.5 million head. Most of the buffalo are
the domestic buffalo used as work animals in much of the world,
particularly in Asia.
   But when it comes to putting beef on the table the Soviet Union
is expected to slaughter 41.5 million head of cattle this year,
followed by the United States at 36.6 million.
   Brazil's 1990 cattle slaughter was shown at 12.2 million, and
China's at 10 million head. India's cattle slaughter was estimated
at 6.5 million head.

<HEAD>East Germans Rattled by Reunification Price Tag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rainer Korkow leaned back on a park bench in
a grassy square called Marx-Engels Forum and pointed to the stark,
gray apartment building across the street.
   ``One hundred and nine marks a month it costs for my four
rooms,'' said the 32-year-old window washer as he lounged in the
sun with his wife and two children on a beautiful Sunday in East
Berlin.
   ``How much will it cost after reunification? Six hundred marks?
Seven hundred? And how much will I make? Half as much!''
   The 109 marks that Korkow pays monthly for a three-room
apartment is officially about 36 West German marks ($21).
   The same modest apartment in West Berlin, one of the world's
most expensive cities, could go for 1,000 marks ($600), perhaps
1,500 marks ($900).
   East Germans who can barely follow the labyrinthine political
wrangling that is a prelude to merging two economically disparate
countries, got a serious dose of price sticker shock during the
weekend.
   The Bundesbank, the government institution that controls the
West German money supply, said it was proposing East German marks
be valued at a 2-1 rate against West German marks in a planned
monetary union.
   That would appear to be a good deal, since East Germany itself
has only an official 3-1 rate. In truth, the currency is
non-convertible and virtually worthless in Western markets.
   But for many East Germans, some of whom fear a Western-style
cost of living as much as they hope for Western-style wages, the
news was disturbing.
   ``I think it's terrible. I work for 600 marks (monthly) now. I
cannot live on 300 marks,'' said Miriam Jonas, 20, an employee at
the government travel bureau in East Berlin. ``All prices, for rent
and groceries, will go up. But our savings and salaries will go
down.''
   ``We were very optimistic. Now, I don't know if we can live with
such conditions,'' she said.
   The idealism that brought down Communism last year has been
quickly replaced by shock over the cost of capitalism.
   Some blame West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for promising them
Western prosperity while campaigning for his political surrogate in
East Germany, Christian Democrat leader Lothar de Maiziere.
   De Maiziere's conservative coalition easily won East Germany's
first free elections on March 18. Now, he is trying to negotiate an
even larger alliance with the left-leaning Social Democrats so he
can have two-thirds control of Parliament and push through Kohl's
plan for swift unification.
   Kohl said Sunday that he never promised a 1-1 money conversion
rate, but he also did not say whether he supported the 2-1 formula
proposed by Bundesbank Chairman Karl Otto Poehl.
   Kohl's sidestep triggered a deluge of criticism in East Germany,
and even de Maiziere responded by saying he was against a 2-1
conversion.
   Lame-duck Communist Premier Hans Modrow told the West German
Bild newspaper Sunday that East Germans are ``increasingly upset''
they will be short-changed by the monetary merger, which West
German leaders have been seeking to realize this summer.
   He said Kohl would bear responisibility for any strikes or
demonstrations.
   The head of East Germany's Labor Union Federation, Helga Mausch,
told the official news agency ADN the organization was telling its
8.6 million members ``to fight for their rights and demonstrate
next week,'' against the proposed exchange rate.
   Kohl, facing his own elections in December, is trying to walk a
thin line between living up to election promises to East German
voters without placing too great an economic burden on the West
German electorate.
   West German financial experts say it will cost of billions of
dollars annually to improve obsolete industries and repair roads
and communications in East Germany over the next five to 10 years.
   Much of the burden is expected to hurt the wealthy West German
economy in the short-term, resulting in a rise in inflation, a
decline in the value of the powerful West mark and even new taxes.
   But some officials have predicted that anything less than a 1-1
conversion could cause a new exodus of East Germans to the West.
   East Germany's collapsing economy and the nearly 500,000 East
Germans who emigrated West since January 1989 were main factors in
the revolt that ousted the hard-line Communist regime.
   Many say a straight 1-1 conversion is necessary to allow East
German workers and elderly people living off savings accounts to
maintain adequate living standards in a unified Germany.
   East Germans currently depend on heavy government subsidies for
housing, food and employment. The subsidies would be phased out in
the new free-market economy under unification.
   Because of its outmoded factories, unemployment would also rise
quickly.
   On Sunday in downtown East Berlin, thousands walked through the
historic heart of the old city.
   A 55-year-old man in a wheelchair said he misses the old regime.
He receives a disability allowance, cheap housing, and buys beer
for the equivalent of about 16 cents.
   ``In the first World War, all was lost. In the second World War,
all was lost. Now, even without a war, all is lost,'' said the man,
who would not identify himself.
   Others are angry that East Germans may be consigned to
second-class status in a unified Germany.
   ``Some people think that the East Germans are stupid. But we're
not,'' said Sabina Plesser, 20. ``A lot of people will be
unemployed, but it will only last a little while. We will learn and
things will get better.''

<HEAD>Doctors Try to Save Bus Driver's Arm, Police Look for Sniper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Incensed by a sniper attack that could
cost a bus driver his arm, Greyhound says it won't bargain with its
striking employees until a week has passed without violence against
the company.
   ``No American worth his salt negotiates with terrorists,''
Greyhound chairman and chief executive Fred G. Currey said at a
Greyhound terminal Sunday on a visit from Dallas to see the wounded
Southeastern Trailways driver.
   David E. Bryant, 58, of Cincinnati, was critically wounded by a
shot fired through the front window of his bus Saturday night from
a pickup truck that pulled alongside, police said. None of the 46
passengers on the Louisville-bound bus was injured.
   Southeastern Trailways is carrying passengers on some Greyhound
routes under a pooling arrangement that existed before the strike,
said a company official.
   ``It's an open-and-shut case of terrorism,'' Currey said at a
news conference.
   Striking drivers said they don't believe any of their members
would shoot another driver.
   Doctors at Vanderbilt University Medical Center operated for six
hours trying to save Bryant's left arm but won't know for several
days whether they succeeded, said Wayne Wood.
   ``If everything goes perfectly, his arm will not need to be
amputated,'' Wood said.
   Currey was not able to visit Bryant, who was recovering from
surgery when the executive arrived.
   About 6,300 Greyhound drivers went on strike March 2 over wages
and job security. The company has reported 29 shootings of buses,
70 bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents since then.
   The company had said it would meet with the union today, but on
Friday canceled the session, citing continued violence.
   No arrests were made in the shooting.
   ``Let the facts speak for themselves. Whatever comes out of it,
if it ends up being strike-related it is; if it isn't, it isn't,''
said Bill Holt, spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.
   Joe Semmes, a local union executive, blamed ``demented people.''
   ``They hear Mr. Currey won't negotiate while this violence
continues and they say, `Here's a good chance I can stir up a lot
of trouble,''' he said.
   ``I can't say with absolute certainty that it wasn't one of our
drivers, but I don't believe it was'' because Southeastern
Trailways drivers are honoring Greyhound picket lines, said local
union spokesman J.R. Green.
   ``By that, I mean not crossing them. They pull the bus over on
the street and a supervisor has to drive it into the terminal and
bring it out again,'' Green said.
   Holt called the idea of police escorting buses ``premature.''

   Cmdr. William Lewis Herndon left the deck of
his foundering SS Central America and went below to don his dress
uniform. With that last act of decorum 133 years ago, Herndon went
down with his ship.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard B. Kellam hears opening
arguments in the dispute between treasure hunters and insurance
companies over the millions in gold that sank with the sidewheel
steamer on Sept. 12, 1857.
   On one side are more than 100 investors in the Columbus America
Discovery Group that used space age technology to locate and
recover the treasure. They claim the gold was abandoned and belongs
to them by the rights of salvage.
   On the other side are 45 insurance firms that have filed suit
contending they have ties to the 19th-century companies which paid
more than $1.2 million in claims after the ship sank.
   Lost in the legal wranglings over the fortune is the story of
the SS Central America and the valor of its sailors and passengers.
   The ship left from what is now Colon, Panama, after picking up
passengers and mail from California. Among its cargo were gold bars
and freshly minted ``double eagle'' gold coins from the San
Francisco mint.
   Four days later, the ship ran into a hurricane and sank in 8,000
feet of water 200 miles off South Carolina. Reports at the time put
the number of dead at between 362 and 423 of the 578 people aboard
and the value of the gold at $1.6 million.
   Not all the ship's gold was recovered in salvage expeditions
last year, and its exact value has yet to be determined. The ship
was carrying about three tons of gold, which would be worth about
$450 million at today's prices.
   In addition, many passengers were carrying fortunes they had
made in California, so the total treasure could be worth up to $1
billion, experts have said.
   Herndon had rallied his crew to keep the vessel afloat through
the two days the ship tried to ride out the storm. He kept order on
the deck as the women and children were loaded into the four
lifeboats.
   A nearby ship took on survivors. When a lifeboat returned to the
sinking ship, a witness said that Herndon ordered the boat to keep
off, fearing it would be swamped by the Central America. It was his
final order.
   Among the passengers were Capt. Thomas Badger and his bride,
Jennie. Badger and his brother John had left Virginia years earlier
to find their fortunes in California, said Curtis Badger, a
great-great-grandnephew.
   ``Apparently, he was returning with about $20,000 in gold. The
story goes that when the women were put in lifeboats, Jennie
wrapped the gold in towels and packed it in a carpetbag. She threw
the carpetbag into the captain's cabin and left the ship,''
Badger's descendant said.
   Jennie Badger survived and was taken to New York City. Her
husband later was pulled from the sea, having clung to a piece of
wood for many hours.
   History may hold a lesson for the current gold seekers, Curtis
Badger said.
   Thomas and John Badger found their fortunes in the gold fields
and both lost them in their lifetimes, Curtis Badger said.
   ``After the war, (John) returned to the family farm and lived
out his life as a farmer and fisherman along the barrier islands.
Thomas lost it all and died without much,'' he said. ``Perhaps it
was John who found the only true fortune.''

<HEAD>US Regains Spot As Leading Exporter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund says the
United States regained its position as the world's leading exporter
last year, three years after losing it to West Germany.
   U.S. foreign sales were worth $364 billion for 1989, compared
with $341.4 billion for West Germany, the IMF said Sunday. Japan
was third with $273.9 billion.
   West Germany had toppled the United States from the No. 1 trade
spot in 1986.
   Both West Germany and Japan had trade surpluses last year, while
the United States had a deficit of $128.9 billion, down from $137.1
billion, according to the IMF's trade calculations.
   The deficit is due to the fact that the United States also is
the world's greatest importer and its imports grew rapidly, to
$492.9 billion from $459.5 billion.
   The fund reported that the West German surplus, now the world's
largest, amounted to $71.4 billion. Japan's was 63.9 billion.
   The Commerce Department, using different means of calculating
the trade imbalance, has put the 1989 merchandise trade deficit at
$109 billion.
   Of six major countries, the United States had the largest
increase in foreign sales, 12.5 percent, the IMF said. West German
exports also rose, by 5.6 percent to $341 billion. Since East
Germany also is an important trader, a reunified Germany may take
over the world's first place as exporter once again.
   As a group, the 22 countries the fund classifies as industrial
increased their buying faster than their sales last year, with many
of the imports apparently from the Third World.
   Led by the United States, they imported $2.2 trillion worth of
goods in 1989, up 8.7 percent. Their exports also rose, to $2.1
trillion , but that was an increase of only 6.5 percent _ a
widening of their overall trade deficit.
   But the West Germans imported only $270 billion dollars worth.
   Japan imported $210 billion worth in 1989, up from $187 billion
the year before, under heavy pressure from the United States and
other trading partners to buy more of their industrial goods.
   For the other 130 countries reported by the fund, which does not
include the Soviet Union, figures for the year were not complete.
The fund's monthly IMF Memorandum said their overall trade surplus
in the first three quarters of 1989 rose to $11.7 billion compared
with $8.8 billion in the same period of 1988.
   Latin American countries were an exception in the Third World.
Struggling to find cash to meet the interest on their debts, they
increased their surplus to $13.1 billion from $10.8 billion for the
nine-month period in 1988.
   The fund noted that Latin America was reporting record
inflation: a price increase of more than 365 percent in the
July-September period over the same period in 1988. The largest
rate was Nicaragua's 4,267 percent: that is, prices more than 42
times the previous year's rate.
   Nicaragua's rate affects a population of fewer than 4 million,
however. Brazil's 144 million people suffered from 1,287 percent
annual inflation. Brazil accounts for a third of Latin America's
economy.
   In Asia, many countries are under pressure to buy from the West.
As a group, Asian Third World countries increased their excess of
imports to $9.9 billion from $2.6 billion for the first nine months
of 1989.
   South Korea still had a $1 billion surplus of exports in 1989,
down from nearly $9 billion in 1988. Others, including China,
contributed to the increasing deficit of the group by selling less
than they bought.
   Asian countries as a whole nevertheless continued to show the
fastest growth in both imports and exports, the fund said.

<HEAD>Senate Will Reject Environmental Bill, EPA Head Predicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental Protection Agency chief William
K. Reilly predicts that a threatened veto by President Bush will
stir the Senate to reject a House-passed effort to establish a
politically independent bureau for collecting and analyzing
environmental data.
   ``We do not want an independent agency that we have no control
over'' as part of a proposed Cabinet-level Department of the
Environment replacing the EPA, Reilly said Sunday. ``We are
confident the Senate will not have a provision of that sort.''
   President Bush in January endorsed a congressional effort to
elevate the EPA to Cabinet status. But the House in approving the
bill last week said it wanted an independent Bureau of
Environmental Statistics in the new department headed by a civil
servant who could be dismissed only for malfeasance.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater immediately raised the
threat of a veto, saying the House bill ``gives a degree of
independence to this unit of the agency which we feel is
unconstitutional.''
   Reilly, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' program, called
the proposal for an independent data agency a ``slight'' to the EPA.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who as chairman of the House
Committee on Government Operations is the chief sponsor of the
independent data agency provision, said it would put a halt to
``conflicts of interest'' that had raised questions in the past
about EPA analyses.

<HEAD>Three Senators Urge US Crackdown on Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should crack down on Iraq
for allegedly trying to dodge American restrictions on nuclear
technology shipments and for using chemical weapons, three senators
say.
   ``I think ... there should be sound and fury and all we're
hearing now is the sounds of silence'' from the Bush
administration, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, the ranking Republican
on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC-TV's
``This Week With David Brinkley'' program.
   ``I don't think we've done enough,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., agreed, saying on the ABC program,
``I think we need to get tough, not just with those Middle Eastern
countries, but also with those that are supplying them.''
   McCain said the Iraqis must be forewarned that the United States
``will exercise all options, including that of military, if
necessary, to prevent this enormous threat from continuing if they
acquire the nuclear weapons we think they are maybe three to four
years away from.''
   Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, must be stopped on his
``messianic mission'' to become a dominant force in the Middle
East, McCain said.
   U.S. and British intelligence forces broke up an alleged Iraqi
smuggling ring in London last week. Officials claimed the Iraqis
were trying to obtain U.S.-made nuclear triggers for atomic weapons.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat,
denied his country was trying to build a nuclear bomb.

<HEAD>Government Requires Proof of No Fungicides in Wines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is requiring some French
and Italian vineyards to certify that wines imported by this
country do not contain traces of a fungicide not approved in the
United States, a spokesman says.
   ``We have found a little bit of Italian sparkling wine and some
French wine that contains traces of a fungicide not approved in the
United States,'' Food and Drug Administration spokesman Bill Grigg
said Sunday.
   There is no ban on the wines, he said, but the vineyards
involved must retain independent testing labs to certify the wines
are fungicide-free before shipping them to the United States.
   The FDA will conduct spot tests on the wines to reaffirm the
certifications, said Grigg.
   The fungicide, procymidone, is made in Japan and is applied to
grapes while they are growing rather than to the wines themselves,
said Grigg.
   Grigg said only a tiny percentage of total exports from the two
countries to the United States was affected.
   He said there is no indication the fungicide _ approved for use
in Europe _ constitutes a health risk, but it has not undergone
U.S. clearance procedures.

<HEAD>Hondurans Hunt Suspects In Attack On U.S. Servicemen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This country's top military officer
has vowed to capture the gunmen who wounded eight U.S. airmen in an
ambush, and a nationwide manhunt for suspected leftist rebels was
under way.
   ``We already have concrete leads on the identities of the
authors of these crimes,'' Gen. Arnulfo Cantero Lopez, the Honduran
armed forces chief, said Sunday in San Pedro Sula, Honduras'
second-largest city. ``We will capture them and apply to them the
full force of the law.''
   Hours after the three gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying 28
U.S. airmen an anonymous caller to a radio network claimed
responsibility on behalf of the leftist Morazano National
Liberation Front.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terrence Kneebone said the Honduran
military was assuming the front, which has claimed responsibility
for previous attacks on U.S. soldiers, was behind Saturday's attack.
   All U.S. military personnel in Honduras were confined to
barracks, and Kneebone said the U.S. Embassy advised U.S. citizens
to keep a low profile and avoid public places where they could be
targeted for attack.
   The wounded servicemen, in this Central American nation on a
mission to build roads and airstrips, had been returning from a
trip to the beach when they were attacked outside Tegucigalpa, the
capital, U.S. officials said.
   Two of them were in critical but stable condition at the Medical
School Hospital in Tegucigalpa, said a news release from the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama, headquarters of U.S. troops in Latin
America.
   It identified them as Airman 1st Class Jerry D. Mallard, who
suffered gunshot wounds to the stomach and back; and Senior Airman
Dean A. Dark, who was wounded in the head.
   Airman 1st Class Brian W. Miller was in stable condition at the
Southern Command's Gorgas Hospital with chest wounds, the release
said.
   Airman 1st Class Todd M. Groeschel and Senior Airman Brian R.
Domsch were treated for minor wounds at a U.S. military clinic in
Soto Cano air force base in Honduras.
   The news release said the five airmen were from the 820th Red
Horse Civil Engineering Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.
   Also being treated at Gorgas Hospital in Panama for leg wounds
were Airman 1st Class Patrick J. Kelly, Sgt. Todd H. Fewell and
Sgt. Kevin A. Flint, the release said.
   Kelly is from the 33rd Combat Communications Squadron at Tinker
Air Force Base in Oklahoma. Fewell is from the 4th Security Police
Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in South Carolina. Flint
is from the 833rd Security Police Squadron at Holloman Air Force
Base in New Mexico.
   The news release said the eight wounded soldiers had been on
temporary duty at Jamastran, a town in southern Honduras.
   All U.S. military personnel in Honduras have been confined to
barracks and ``all trips are canceled'' under further notice. The
embassy has advised U.S. citizens in Honduras to keep a low profile
and avoid public places where they could be targeted for attack,
Kneebone said.
   The United States keeps an average of 1,200 troops in Honduras
on a year-round basis and additional soldiers are sometimes brought
in for joint exercises with the Honduran military.

<TEXT>
   Planners of Peoria's tricentennial
celebration are going shopping across the river for a little
history.
   The group, the Peoria 1691 Foundation, has proposed buying four
old houses in Missouri and moving them to Illinois to reconstruct a
French colony of the banks of the Illinois River just like the
settlement that evolved into Peoria.
   The original village in what is now downtown Peoria was
destroyed by fire in 1812, so civic leaders have set their sights
on the French colonial houses built in the late 18th and early 19th
centuries in Ste. Genevieve, Mo.
   But what might play in Peoria doesn't play well in Ste.
Genevieve.
   ``This is just like the rape of antiquities in the colonial
days,'' said Melburn Thurman, a Ste. Genevieve anthropologist.
``This is a totally unethical and reprehensible action by the city
of Peoria. They are trying to steal our great prize, our historic
jewel.''
   But Dorothy Sinclair, administrative director of the Peoria
Historical Society, views the action as one of historic
preservation.
   ``We came along and expressed an interest in them after learning
they were being sold and threatened with possible destruction,''
Mrs. Sinclair said.
   ``We did not go down there in the night and carry them away. We
think it's better they be saved and preserved in Peoria than being
torn down in Ste. Genevieve.''
   Ste. Genevieve, a town of 5,000 situated 75 miles south of St.
Louis, was once part of France's Louisiana Territory, bought by the
United States in 1803.
   The historical society estimates it would cost $500,000 to buy
and relocate the houses. The non-profit group would raise the money
through donations and doesn't need Peoria officials' approval.
   Ste. Genevieve city commissioners could block the plan since the
houses are on the National Registry of Historic Places, but they
have taken no action so far. The Peoria group has yet to sign an
agreement to buy the houses.
   Royce and Margaret Wilhauk, who own three of the houses, said
they contacted the state of Missouri after officials in Peoria made
an offer last fall.
   ``We have given the state an option on the houses and they've
asked for an extension,'' Mrs. Wilhauk said. ``We'd like the houses
to stay here. But if we can't work something out, we will consider
the Peoria offer.''
   Frank Myers of Ste. Genevieve's Foundation for Preservation says
the houses should stay. ``We'd like to share our knowledge with
Peoria, but we don't necessarily want to share our buildings with
Peoria,'' he said.

   Jose Ambrosio Alvarez left for
the United States three years ago with cooking skills learned in a
hospital kitchen and an immigrant's dream of a better life.
   On Sunday, his body was returned in a plain wooden box along
with the bodies of 47 other Hondurans killed with him in a blaze at
an illegal New York social club.
   ``You leave here with such high hopes of better things,'' said
his 32-year-old brother, Gerardo Alvarez. ``This has been a
terrible blow to us.''
   At least 79 of the 87 people killed in the March 25 fire at the
Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx were Hondurans. Authorities
have said a Cuban immigrant set the blaze after being spurned by
his girlfriend, a club employee. The Happy Land club was a
home-away-from-home for Honduran immigrants, who went there to
dance, chat and drink.
   The coffins on Sunday arrived in the northern industrial city of
San Pedro Sula aboard a DC-8 transport plane chartered by the Red
Cross.
   The victims, mostly young people in their late teens and early
20s, were largely poor immigrants from San Pedro Sula and towns
dotting Honduras' Atlantic coast such as Puerto Cortes, Tela, La
Ceiba, Trujillo.
   The story of 27-year-old Jose Alvarez is familiar in these parts
of high unemployment, low wages and wide poverty.
   Clothing and furniture factories and food packing plants are San
Pedro Sula's backbone. But the jobs they provide are far fewer than
the numbers of poor from outlying areas who flock to the city
looking for work.
   At the airport early Sunday, family members clung to each other
for support as an orange forklift unloaded the coffins four at a
time. The coffins were laid in rows on the airport tarmac before
the grief-stricken families.
   Wreaths were laid atop each box and the Roman Catholic bishop of
San Pedro Sula, Monsignor Jaime Brufeau, said a brief Mass.
   ``Most of them went to the United States with high hopes, and
they come back dead. We are very sad,'' said President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas, who came to San Pedro Sula to be with dozens of
mourning relatives.
   Army helicopters were to fly some bodies to the victims' home
towns. Others were simply carried away by their families.
   Many relatives, who stood at the airport under a hot tropical
sun for more than two hours, collapsed and were carried away by
Honduran Red Cross volunteers.
   One man's grief broke into fury toward the suspected arsonist.
   ``Damned Cuban, I'll kill you!'' shouted Juan Alberto Pena, 19,
clenching his fist. Pena, of Progreso, was at the airport awaiting
the body of his brother, Jeremias.
   On Friday, Cuban immigrant Julio Gonzalez, 36, was indicted by a
New York state grand jury on 178 counts of murder, arson and other
charges. Authorities say he set the fire at the Happy Land club
with gasoline from a nearby gas station.
   Some relatives said they were preparing to file lawsuits.
   ``We have made our decision,'' a grim-faced Gregorio Hernandez
said. His nephew, 24-year-old Jose Manuel Marquez Hernandez, was a
victim.
   ``We're going to sue the city (of New York), the gas station and
the owners of the building,'' Hernandez said.
   Wakes and funerals were scheduled for today and Tuesday in
surrounding towns.

   Investigators worked to sort auto parts
and lawn equipment from a pieces of a small plane that crashed and
exploded in a neighborhood, demolishing a home and garages and
killing at least one person.
   The twin-engine plane flew out of control from the foothills at
up to 150 mph Sunday afternoon, plowing into one of the most
densely populated sections of this city of about 100,000 situated
30 miles from Denver, authorities said.
   ``The plane hit a good-size tree and disintegrated,'' city
spokesmsan David Grimm.
   ``I heard the sound of trees snapping and the most incredible
sound I had ever heard ... and I realized that no one could have
survived that crash,'' said John Mink, who lives across from the
crash site. ``The whole center of the block was on fire.''
   One body, burned beyond recognition, was pulled from the
wreckage, and authorities were working to determine whether the
victim was Bill Layne, listed on the flight plan as the pilot,
Grimm said. The flight plan indicated there may have been a
passenger, but investigators saw no immediate signs of another body.
   The crash destroyed a vacant home up for sale, six parked cars
and at least four garages, authorities said.
   One person on the ground was injured. Harold Parks, 54, had been
working in his garage and was thrown some 40 feet by the explosion,
authorities said. He was listed in good condition with a broken hip
at Boulder Community Hospital.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Verlin B.
Tranter said said it was ``pure luck'' there weren't more deaths
and injuries.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   Grimm said the plane was experiencing some sort of engine
trouble before the crash.
   Tranter said it will be difficult to make sense of the wreckage.
   ``The aircraft struck a garage and spread the equipment and junk
from the garages around so it's mixed in with the aircraft parts,''
he said. ``I've been doing these investigations for 12 years as a
civilian and six years in the military before that and I've never
seen such a mess. We've got a real sorting job ahead of us.''
   Tranter said the flight plan indicated the Cessna 421-C aircraft
took off from the Denver area to take a passenger to Granby, west
of the Continental Divide in the Colorado Rockies, then return to
Denver.
   Tranter said he didn't know whether the plane had made it to
Granby or how many people were on board the plane when it crashed.
The plane, which seats six or seven, was owned by Skyways
Associates of Raton, N.M., he said.
   Mink said he watched from his balcony as the plane came in over
a rock outcropping, banked with its wings almost vertical. ``He
leveled out, but was losing altitude rapidly,'' Mink said. ``I saw
him go down across the street.''
   Witnesses aid flames climbed 20 to 30 feet high.
   Utility crews worked restore telephone and electricity to two
blocks that were left without service when the plane clipped
overhead lines.

   Thunderstorms produced hail and high winds in the South, and
skies were dry most everywhere west of the Rockies.
   Storms were severe Sunday in portions of Texas, Mississippi,
Alabama and North Carolina, the National Weather Service said.
   Hail the size of golf balls fell in Andrews, Texas; Highland
Home, Ala.; Wheeling, W.Va., and De Kalb, Miss. High winds downed
trees and power lines in Alabama.
   Winds gusted to 58 mph in Montgomery and a trailer home was
overturned near Ansley in Alabama. Charlotte, N.C., was whipped by
gusts of 78 mph.
   The weather service said thunderstorms spawned a tornado near
Winters, Texas.
   Virginia and Louisiana also received thunderstorms.
   Light rain and drizzle fell over New York state and Vermont.
Light rain ahead of a cold front extended from Illinois to upper
Michigan.
   Showers were scattered over Arizona and Aouthern California. Dry
weather prevailed elsewhere in the West, with fair skies over much
of the Central Plains.
   The high Sunday in the Lower 48 states was 89 degrees in Miami.

   Palm Springs and its mayor, singer Sonny
Bono, don't want the spring break crowd anymore. But neighboring
Orange County is working hard to lure young sun-seekers to shores
freshly scrubbed after a big oil spill.
   ``We're ready for them! We're excited to have our beaches ready
for Easter vacation. I know the merchants are gearing up for them
and we expect a good crowd,'' said Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays.
   The 400,000-gallon spill by a tanker Feb. 7 is now just an
unpleasant memory, the crude gone and the shoreline between
Huntington Beach and Newport Beach cleaner than ever, Mays said.
   ``Come witness one of the finest surfing schools on the West
Coast. You don't have to hang 10 or shoot the curl to have a good
time,'' reads a $73,000 full-page color ad in today's USA Today.
There is no mention of the spill.
   But 100 miles inland, the sunbaked Palm Springs oasis notorious
for spring break madness has bluntly declared it doesn't want the
teen-age exercise in excess.
   Libidinous high school and college students, bent on celebrating
booze, sun and each other, traditionally descend on the desert
resort with one motive in mind _ to party down.
   But now, said Palm Springs spokesman Frank Cullen, ``We don't
see any value in having all these kids here.''
   ``This has been a growing sentiment ever since it started
getting out of control in the 1980s and after the riot of 1986,''
Cullen said.
   Some of the estimated 15,000 students in Palm Springs that year
went on a rampage, harassing motorists, pulling clothing off women
and hurling bottles and rocks at police. Since then, law
enforcement has been bolstered during spring break.
   The 81-member police force, supplemented by Highway Patrol
officers and sheriff's deputies, begins a week of 12-hour shifts on
Friday.
   ``We mean business when it comes to enforcing the laws,'' Cullen
said. ``Mayor Bono feels very strongly about this.''
   It appears that Bono himself may intervene in enforcing local
laws. Just last weekend, while riding his motorcycle, his honor
chased down a speeding biker.
   The mayor, who became famous singing ``I Got You Babe'' with
ex-wife Cher, said he told the biker, ``You'd better learn to read
real fast unless you want to spend the night in jail.''
   That's when the young rider noticed ``Mayor Sonny Bono'' printed
on the T-shirt.
   It costs the city about $350,000 to beef up the police force to
keep order during Easter week, a time when the city's population
swells from about 40,000 to more than 100,000. ``It's just a real
drain on our resources,'' said Cullen.

   Tiananmen Square reopened today with armed police
maintaining a conspicuous presence among sparse rainy day crowds.
   The vast square was closed to the general public on Sunday, a
day overseas dissidents had asked students and others to ``stroll''
through it in a silent protest over the military suppression last
June of the pro-democracy movement.
   On Sunday, the city instead brought in some 5,000 schoolchildren
who banged cymbals and beat drums as part of ceremonies to
encourage civic enthusiasm for the Asian Games to be held in
Beijing in September.
   Chinese offices and factories told people to stay away from the
square on Sunday and warned they should not go to Tiananmen on
other anniversaries of events highlighting the April-June democracy
campaign.
   The 100-acre square, China's symbolic political center, was open
as usual today, but with a heavy police presence. About a dozen
police vans and jeeps were parked on the square, and at least 10
pairs of police armed with pistols and walkie-talkies were seen
patrolling the plaza.
   People were not allowed to walk around the base of the monument
to revolutionary martyrs in the center of the square. The monument,
normally open, was guarded by about 15 police, up from the usual
four sentries.
   Fire trucks with water cannons were parked on the east side of
the square next to the history museum and outside the Great Hall of
the People to the west. A dozen plainclothes police were seen
gathered next to the Great Hall.
   Small groups of Chinese and foreign tourists wandered around the
square and long lines formed as usual to see the body of Mao
Tse-tung in Mao's mausoleum on its south end. Crowds were thin,
however, because of the wet weather.
   Heavy police surveillance is likely to continue through April 5,
the annual Qingming festival when Chinese honor their dead.
   Dissidents have also called for a ``protest stroll'' through the
square on that day to honor the hundreds of people killed June 3-4
when the military stormed the city to wrest control of the square
from pro-democracy students.
   The capital's beefed-up security forces will also be on alert on
April 15, the first anniversary of the death of former Communist
Party chief Hu Yaobang, the event that touched off the biggest show
of resistance to China's political system in the party's 40-year
rule.

   For a while, it looked like the joke was
going to be on the pranksters at the 11th Annual St. Stupid's Day
Parade, which got off to a late start because half the participants
forgot to set their clocks ahead.
   But once the gang gathered nearly an hour after the official
starting time, the ritual celebration of April Fools' Day was under
way.
   One participant wore a wedding dress and carried a drum. Patrick
Campbell wore a blanket and a Donald Duck safari hat.
   Founder ``Bishop Joey,'' a fat, balding man in red leotards,
arrived to a drum roll and handed out kazoos.
   ``I am Bishop Joey, head of the Church of the Last Laugh, the
world's fastest growing snack religion!'' yelled the bishop, who is
also known as actor Ed Holmes of the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
   ``Wise up! It's later than we think!'' he said, leading the
crowd down Columbus Avenue.

   George slept here, but he's not in now.
   Dozens of people received telephone messages Sunday with a
number and instructions to call George back. Upon dialing the
number, they learned the George they were looking for had left _
quite some time ago.
   That's because ``George'' is George Washington. And the messages
to call him were left by practical jokesters up to a traditional
April Fools' Day ruse.
   The phone number belongs to Washington's Headquarters State
Historic Site in Newburgh, north of New York City. George and
Martha Washington lived at the site for 16{ months as the
Revolutionary War drew to a close.
   ``When people call for George they don't know it's George
Washington they're asking for,'' said site manager Tom Hughes. ``We
try to gently clue them in that George is George Washington and
that he hasn't been here for a long, long time.''
   Hughes said the calls have been pouring in every April Fools'
Day for 20 years. He said some callers are slow to accept they have
fallen victim to a practical joke.
   ``There are many people that are convinced that there must be a
George here and want to speak with him,'' Hughes said.

<HEAD>Ann Arbor Votes on $5 Abortion Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WISNIEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in this college town today
weighed a proposal by abortion-rights activists to make abortion
punishable by a $5 ticket.
   Advocates said the largely symbolic act could give local
authorities an alternative to criminal prosecution should state or
federal laws change to outlaw abortion.
   ``What it says to police is don't go looking for abortion
criminals, go look for murderers and rapists,'' said Sabra Briere,
a student services coordinator at the University of Michigan who
led the drive to put the measure on the ballot.
   The president of Right to Life of Michigan said abortion foes in
Ann Arbor, rather than fighting the $5 plan, have been
concentrating on a statewide petition drive to require parental
consent for anyone under 18 to have an abortion.
   ``We're putting our energies where they're more needed and more
effective,'' said Barbara Listing.
   ``Ann Arbor is a rather unique community,'' she added. ``Even if
it does pass, it's really not going to have any effect. Abortion is
still legal.''
   Voters in this city of 108,000 also were to decide today whether
to increase the penalty from $5 to $25 for selling and possessing
marijuana.
   The $5 fine has been on the books since 1974, when the
student-backed Human Rights Party petitioned to place it on a
ballot and voters passed it.
   Opponents of the fine said this has created a perception of the
city as a haven for drugs, a perception reinforced with the annual
April 1 ``Hash Bash'' _ a big marijuana party _ on the University
of Michigan campus.
   Sunday's Hash Bash, billed as a rally to retain the $5 fine,
took place only after the American Civil Liberties Union went to
court to force university officials to honor a permit issued
earlier but then withdrawn. More than 3,000 people attended.
   About 15 percent of the voters today were expected to be
students.

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces clashed with
artillery and tanks in east Beirut and mountains to the northeast
today, setting fuel tanks ablaze in an inferno that threatened a
liquor factory's alcohol stocks.
   The fighting in the city's Christian sector and fog-shrouded
Kesrouan highlands broke out around midnight, shredding a
cease-fire brokered by Vatican-backed mediators only a few hours
earlier.
   One person was wounded by sniper fire in the fighting between
rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's 19,000 troops and the Lebanese Forces
militia led by Samir Geagea, a police report said.
   At least 839 people have been killed and 2,290 wounded since
Jan.30, when Aoun attacked the militia in a bid to crush the main
challenge to his authority in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Police said both sides pounded each other's positions with 155mm
howitzers, tanks and multi-barreled rocket launchers in the latest
flare-up.
   The shelling set fire to fuel tanks in the Aoun-controlled area
of Jal el-Dib in east Beirut before dawn, turning the night sky red
as flames shot up over the Christian enclave.
   The fire threatened to engulf a nearby factory that makes Arak,
a licorice-flavored Pernod-like liquor that is Lebanon's national
drink.
   Associated Press photographer Eddy Tamerian said firefighters
were battling to keep the blaze from reaching the factory, ``but
the fire is so big it could continue to rage for days.''
   Witnesses said a dozen other fires burned in the Christian
enclave.
   The short-lived cease-fire negotiated by a three-man committee
of neutral Christians on Sunday was the 15th such truce since Jan.
30.
   So far, neither side has been able to score a decisive victory.
But Geagea's forces control two-thirds of the Christian sector,
including the ports in Beirut, Jounieh and Byblos and all airfields.
   Aoun must secure at least one port to open a seaborne supply
route. Hostile Syrian troops and their Moslem militia allies ring
the Christian sector on its landward sides.
   Sunday's truce halted two days of fighting in which Aoun tried
in vain to break through the Lebanese Forces' defenses in Kesrouan
and Geagea's east Beirut strongholds in the Ashrafiyeh and
Karantina districts.
   Beirut's leftist as-Safir daily quoted a source close to Aoun as
saying of the cease-fire: ``The committee has failed ... There will
be no more mediations.''
   Police estimated that up to one-third of the 1 million
Christians living in the enclave have fled to safer areas since
Jan. 30. Those who remain in the battle zone seek to retain some
semblance of normality.
   Salim Abu-Samra and Rita Zgheib took advantage of Sunday's lull
to get married in the Aoun-controlled Zalka area. But they took no
chances. Both wore flak jackets over their wedding outfits.
   Aoun has refused to recognize Hrawi, who was elected in November
to implement an Arab League-brokered peace plan, and rejects the
plan because it does not provide cast-iron guarantees of a Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon.
   He considers the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in Lebanon under
a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate an army of occupation.
   But there have been signs that Aoun, his forces isolated, is
softening his anti-Syrian stand. He confirmed a report in Kuwait's
Al-Qabas newspaper Friday that he told Arab leaders he was ready to
accept an amended peace accord.
   He did not say how he wanted the treaty changed, but he has said
before his main concern remains getting the Syrians out of Lebanon.
Previous mediation efforts have foundered.
   Hrawi, 64, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun and Geagea, dismissed
Aoun as interim prime minister and army commander in November. But
Aoun refuses to step down.

   Former refusenik Natan Sharansky told an
estimated 120,000 protesters outside the United Nations not to ease
pressure on the Kremlin despite increased Jewish emigration from
the Soviet Union.
   ``When you hear that there are wonderful leaders in the Soviet
Union, don't believe this,'' said Sharansky, who left the Soviet
Union in 1986. ``It is you who made all these changes possible,
it's your struggle to change our future.''
   The ``Solidarity Sunday Rally Of Response'' came six days after
Hungary's airline, Malev, halted flights to Tel Aviv because of
Arab terrorist threats. The airline resumed limited flights from
Budapest to Tel Aviv on Sunday.
   ``To stand resolute against these terrorist threats is to defeat
their cowardly perpetrators,'' President Bush said in a statement
read at the rally. ``Soviet Jews must be allowed free and unimpeded
transit as well as direct flights to Israel.''
   In recent years, Soviet authorities have let thousands of Jews
leave the country. In 1986, only 914 were allowed out.
   Thousands of Jews are trying to leave the Soviet Union for
Israel. But there are no direct flights between the Soviet Union
and Israel, so emigres must travel via third countries, such as
Hungary or Czechoslovakia.
   Arab nations have asked the Soviet Union to slow the tide. Arab
nations fear that Israel will settle Soviet emigres in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where thousands of Palestinians are
protesting against Israeli rule.
   Speakers at Sunday's rally expressed alarm over reports that
anti-Semitism is growing in the Soviet Union.
   ``Jews are terrified over threats to their life and limb,'' said
Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, chairman of the Greater New York Coalition
for Soviet Jewry, the rally's sponsor.
   ``We say to Mikhail Gorbachev: We have nothing against you or
the Soviet Union. But we demand that you crush the anti-Semitic
savages in your country.''
   Police estimated the crowd at 120,000 people.

   Prosecutors today dropped charges against an
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer accused of violating the
nation's most restrictive abortion law by encouraging others to
seek abortions.
   The charges against Janet Benshoof were dropped by territorial
Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson. She said she acted in
part because of a lawsuit that she considers bigger test of the new
abortion law than Benshoof's case.
   Benshoof, director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project,
was arrested March 21, two days after the law was signed, on
charges of solicitation to commit abortion.
   Benshoof, who came here from New York in hopes of persuading
Gov. Joseph Ada to veto the measure, had publicly encouraged women
seeking abortions to have them performed in Hawaii.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother.
   The law has not been enforced since a restraining order was
issued March 23. The order is to remain in place until a lawsuit
challenging the law is heard in federal court May 8.
   The lawsuit was filed by ``Marie Doe,'' a pregnant woman who
wanted an abortion, the Guam Society of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an Episcopal priest and
three doctors.

<HEAD>U.S. To Guerrillas: Stay Out of Drug Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has told Afghan
guerrillas to stay out of the drug business or risk losing support
in the fight against their country's government, a senior American
official said today.
   ``What we have made very clear to the mujahedeen commanders is
that they must stay out of drugs and that they must discourage
production of drugs,'' said Melvyn Levitsky, an asssistant
secretary of state for international narcotics matters.
   ``We cannot accept a situation where we are giving assistance to
the mujahedeen and they on the other hand are encouraging drug
production and drug trafficking,'' he said at the end of a
three-day visit to Pakistan.
   The major mujahedeen groups, which are based in Pakistan, have
acknowledged that some of their local commanders are involved in
poppy cultivation. But the groups' leaders deny they condone it.
   Levitsky is touring Thailand, India, Pakistan and Turkey as part
of President Bush's efforts to involve more countries in the fight
against drugs.
   Afghanistan produced an estimated 750 tons of opium in 1988,
making it the world's second biggest supplier after Burma.
   The decade-old war between the Soviet-backed government in Kabul
and the Moslem guerrillas has destroyed much of Afghanistan's
agrarian economy.
   But the fighting has turned the small centuries-old tradition of
poppy cultivation into a multimillion dollar industry and spawned
what many Pakistanis call ``the heroin and Kalashnikov culture,''
referring to the preferred automatic weapon of the region's drug
lords.
   The poppies yield a sticky substance that is refined into heroin
powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged frontier and then
spirited through Pakistan to markets in Europe and the United
States.
   The United States provides an estimated $300 million in annual
assistance to the mujahedeen, or holy warriors, who are fighting to
replace the Communist-style government in Kabul.
   Levitsky said Washington would not support any government in
Afghanistan that tolerated or encouraged drug production and
trafficking.
   ``The point we have made to the mujahedeen is that if there is
considerable evidence that there is ... support for drug production
and drug trafficking we would not be able to assistant that
government,'' he said.
   Opium production and to some extent export have existed for
centuries in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Poppy cultivation has declined steadily in Pakistan, but it has
risen sharply in Afghanistan, where tribal areas along the
mountainous frontier have become a haven for drug lords.
   The United States has only recently started working with
guerrilla leaders to discourage poppy cultivation and launched a
program to promote drug awareness among the insurgents, offering
incentives to substitute poppy with other crops. But most are
unattractive to poppy growers accustomed to huge profits.
   According to U.S. officials, about 80 percent of the heroin sold
in Europe and 25 percent sold in the United States comes from
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran _ the so-called ``Golden Crescent.''
The rest comes from Mexico and the ``Golden Triangle'' of Thailand,
Laos and Burma.
   ``We are now beginning to look very seriously at a
counter-heroin strategy,'' Levitsky told a news conference.
   ``Many experts believe that the crack-cocaine epidemic may not
last so long based on the history of epidemics centered on
stimulants like cocaine being rather short-lived and often being
followed by an epidemic based on depressants like heroin,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Society of Professional Journalists has
awarded its 1989 Sigma Delta Chi Award for deadline reporting to
the San Francisco Examiner staff for their coverage of the Oct. 17
earthquake that rocked the California city.
   The award was one of 26 for print and broadcast journalism
announced Sunday by the Chicago-based society, which has issued

<HEAD>Mugabe Takes Election But Result Indicates Dissatisfaction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe said his party's
sweeping victory in elections gave him a mandate to push ahead with
one-party rule, but many said the poor voter turnout indicated
dissatisfaction with the government.
   Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union won all but three of
Parliament's 150 seats in three days of elections that ended Friday.
   ``It is a mandate for all our policies, including a one-party
state,'' Mugabe said at a news conference Sunday.
   But the three seats lost to the opposition were two more than
after the last elections in 1985.
   Mugabe had urged voters in this nation of 9.2 million to send no
opposition legislators to Parliament and permit his party to amend
the constitution to institute one-party rule. That would require a
unanimous vote.
   Also, election officials said only about 54 percent of the 4.8
million voters cast ballots. In the last elections, turnout was
more than 80 percent.
   Most observers said this year's poor turnout raised the question
of whether Mugabe, 66, received the strong mandate he was seeking.
   They said voter apathy was a result of feelings that none of the
parties could bring down the nation's record unemployment and
soaring inflation, and deal with transportation problems.
   Mugabe indicated his party would not immediately outlaw
opposition parties or bar the three opposition legislators from
taking their seats.
   ``As we get to a stage when we feel the moment has come for us
to establish a one-party state, we will do so. They can continue to
operate until that moment comes,'' he said.
   Two of the opposition victories were in eastern Zimbabwe, the
traditional stronghold of Edgar Tekere's main opposition party, the
Zimbabwe Unity Movement. Tekere, 52, declined to comment on the
outcome of the elections.
   The third went to a member of the Ndonga party, which represents
the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, who founded Mugabe's party but now
lives in exile in the United States. Mugabe accuses Sithole of
plotting to overthrow him.
   Mugabe led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence
a decade ago after a seven-year guerrilla war.

   A man struck by lightning while
police sought him for questioning in the stabbing of his wife was
in serious but stable condition today, a hospital official said.
   Kevin Callahan, 32, was found Saturday, lying semiconscious on a
fishing catwalk of the Gandy Bridge, the causeway between Tampa and
St. Petersburg. He was barefoot and had suffered injuries to his
right hand and left foot, said Marianne Pasha, a spokeswoman for
the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department.
   He managed to tell his rescuers that he was wanted by the
police. At Bayfront Medical Center, physicians determined that
lightning had hit Callahan's hand and exited through the foot, Ms.
Pasha said.
   His wife, Janet, 28, also was listed in serious condition at
Bayfront Medical Center. On Thursday, a neighbor found her in the
Callahans' home here, stabbed in the throat and back with a butcher
knife, police said.
   Saturday afternoon, as he lay in a hospital bed, Callahan was
charged with aggravated battery.
   Deputies don't know what Callahan was doing on the bridge's
fishing catwalk during a thunderstorm early Saturday. Investigators
said he apparently drove there in his mother's car, which was found
on the causeway.

   A bomb wrecked two vehicles early today
and a gunman killed one man at a political rally in pre-election
violence on the southern Aegean island of Crete, officials said.
   Despite the presence of extra police units flown to Crete to
prevent further violence between conservatives and socialists, the
atmosphere remained tense as the country headed for crucial general
elections next Sunday.
   The bomb was planted in a private garage near the home of
Vangelis Kefaloyannis, whose brother Manolis is a ranking member of
the conservative New Democracy party, a police spokesman said. No
injuries were reported in the blast.
   None of the cars destroyed in the blast belonged to the
Kefaloyannis family, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Shots were fired from a moving car Sunday, killing a supporter
of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and wounding four
others. PASOK supporters had set up barricades to prevent
conservatives from attending a political rally in which New
Democracy party leader Constantine Mitsotakis was scheduled to
speak.
   Police said no arrests have been made.
   In Athens, a firebomb slightly damaged the suburban political
headquarters of George Birdimiris, a socialist candidate for
Parliament.
   Birdimiris, contacted by telephone, said vandals also smashed
the window of a PASOK election center in the same suburb of Haidari.
   A branch of the Ionian bank in another Athens suburb was
slightly damaged by a firebomb but the police spokesman said they
were investigating to see whether it was connected with the
elections.
   President Christos Sartzetakis dissolved Parliament on March 12
and set elections for April 8 after two inconclusive elections
since last June.

   Federal police today smashed a
computer-hacking ring and arrested three young men following
complaints from the FBI about illegal intrusions into university
computer systems in the United States.
   The three were charged in Melbourne Court with damaging data in
government computers, which is punishable with a maximum of 10
years in jail. Their identities were not made available but police
said they ranged in age from 18 to 21.
   A police spokesman said the suspects were arrested following
raids earlier in the day in which computers were put out of action
to prevent the destruction of software.
   The arrests followed a six-month investigation conducted jointly
by Australian federal police, the FBI and police in the state of
Victoria.
   Federal police alleged the three hackers _ using the codenames
Phoenix, Electron and Nom _ hacked into universities and
laboratories in Australia and overseas.
   Police said it was the biggest Australian-based computer hacking
operation uncovered so far.
   U.S. investigators first discovered an Australian-based hacker
was at work in 1988 when it was found the Citibank system had been
illegally entered. Further reports of extensive illegal entry to
U.S. computers followed throughout last year.
   A Federal Police spokesman said their investigation began in
earnest only six months ago after the Commonwealth Crimes Act was
approved last July covering offenses on illegal computer use.

   New York City's government has been branded the
largest single landlord of illegal social clubs.
   At least 52 social clubs listed by the city as ``nuisance''
establishments are on city-owned property, according to reports
published in weekend newspapers.
   A police crackdown on the clubs started after 87 people, mostly
Hondurans, died March 25 in an arson fire at the illegal Happy Land
Social Club in the Tremont section of the Bronx.
   The bodies of 48 of the victims arrived Sunday in Honduras for
burial.
   ``Most of them went to the United States with high hopes, and
they came back dead. We are very sad,'' said President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas, who joined dozens of mourning relatives at the
airport at San Pedro Sula.
   Wakes and funerals were scheduled in 11 towns in northern
Honduras.
   The New York Times said Sunday that police documents list at
least 52 clubs as ``nuisance'' establishments in properties owned
by the city, including two in city housing projects. That would
make the city the largest single landlord of such clubs.
   In late editions Saturday, the Daily News reported that as many
as 46 illegal clubs are located in city-owned residential
buildings. It based its report on a review of Buildings Department
and real estate records as well as inspections by city agencies.
   Lee Jones, a spokesman for Mayor David Dinkins, said the city
inherited the clubs along with vast numbers of tenants and
abandoned buildings.
   ``Is it embarrassing?'' Jones said. ``It's something we're going
to have to deal with.''

   Doctors working for six hours in a
sandbagged bunker outside a hospital removed an unexploded grenade
imbedded in the right arm of a teen-age guerrilla for three days,
officials said today.
   A U.S.-made M-79 rifle grenade the size of a large egg
accidentally entered the right arm of Jayee Khoen, 15, when
guerrillas fired the weapon during a training exercise near the
Thai border Wednesday, a police officer said.
   The Bangkok Post newspaper, quoting unnamed border patrol
policemen, identified Jayee as a guerrilla working with Khun Sa,
the Burmese opium warlord indicted last month by a U.S. court for
heroin trafficking.
   The police officer said Jayee was rushed to Maharak Nakorn
hospital in Chiang Mai Saturday after doctors at two other
hospitals refused to operate for fear of detonating the grenade, a
hospital spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who could not be identified, said a police
surgeon aided by three bomb disposal men removed the grenade Sunday
in an operation in a sandbagged bunker on the lawn outside the

   Lithuania sent a delegation to Moscow today in
hopes of beginning talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and President
Vytautas Landsbergis said he hoped for a peaceful settlement
despite a Kremlin demand he back down.
   About 1,000 pro-independence demonstrators rallied outside the
Lithuanian prosecutor's office in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius
against the occupation of the building Friday night by Soviet
soldiers, sources said.
   Both a prosecutor appointed by Lithuania's breakaway government
and one sent from Moscow were working in the building today, and
employees reported no direct conflicts between the two.
   Spokesmen for the Lithuanian Supreme Council said legislator
Egidius Bickaukas went to Moscow in hopes of starting talks with
Soviet leaders, and that three other people including Deputy
Premier Romualdas Ozolas were following.
   Bickauskas has spent much of the past two weeks in Moscow trying
without success to begin talks with the Kremlin on Lithuania's
March 11 declaration of independence.
   Official Radio Moscow quoted Landsbergis as saying Lithuania
``will do everything ... to regulate relations with the Soviet
Union.''
   Landsbergis ``does not view the present situation as hopeless,''
it said.
   The republic's Presidium of the Supreme Council legislature met
Sunday night, and Landsbergis was expected to address the full
legislature during a session this afternoon to discuss a statement
late Saturday from Gorbachev.
   The Soviet president urged Lithuanians to renounce their
declaration of independence and then enter into talks with the
Kremlin on the basis of the Soviet Constitution. He warned that a
refusal may result in ``grave consequences for all of us.''
   Gorbachev has promised Lithuania and other independence-minded
Soviet republics to establish a constitutional mechanism on
secession, but the measure presently before the Soviet legislature
gives the Kremlin final authority in such issues.
   Landsbergis rejected Gorbachev's appeal, saying the Soviet
leader was demanding ``impossible things.''
   ``It cannot be now demanded that we annul everything that we
bore in our hearts,'' he said in comments carried Sunday by the
official Soviet news agency Tass.
   At the republican prosecutor's office, secretary Henrika Pocei
said by telephone that the chief prosecutor approved by the
Lithuanian government, Arturis Paulauskas, and a team sent from
Moscow both had appeared for work today.
   Soldiers occupied the building Friday night after a failed
attempt by the Moscow team to make employees obey their orders, but
the workers returned Monday, she said.
   ``Absolutely everyone is at his workplace,'' she said.
   About 1,000 pro-independence demonstrators rallied outside the
prosecutor's office in support of Paulauskas, sources said by
telephone from Vilnius, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The last Western correspondents were forced to leave Lithuania
on Sunday night on orders of the Soviet government.
   Last week, Gorbachev said he would use force only if lives were
threatened. But Soviet troops subsequently rounded up several dozen
Lithuanians who had deserted the Red Army, and seized several
buildings, on Friday taking over the Lithuanian prosecutor's office
and the main newspaper printing plant.
   ``I fear they are going to start shooting,'' one middle-aged
Lithuanian woman said Sunday.
   Western reporters counted nearly 30 armored vehicles being
unloaded from trains that arrived near the Vilnius airport on
Sunday. Others drove through the city, their treads slicing into
the asphalt, apparently on their way to a nearby base.
   On Friday, neighboring Estonia pledged to join Lithuania in its
drive to regain independence lost in 1940 when the Soviet Union
forcibly annexed them along with the third Baltic republic, Latvia.
   Latvia is expected to pursue independence next month and
possibly move with the caution exhibited by the Estonians, who
opted to defer declaring a formal break from Moscow until after an
unspecified ``transition period.''
   Algimantas Cekuolis, a Lithuanian newspaper editor who has
become a de facto spokesman for his republic's government, compared
the Kremlin's strong-arm tactics with those of Soviet leaders of
the authoritarian past.
   ``It's the same Brezhnev doctrine at work as in
Czechoslovakia,'' only this time, Gorbachev is moving ``with a
smile, slowly and easily,'' he said, referring to the premise used
by the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev to justify the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Despite the pressure, Lithuanian officials said they are
confident Moscow will become less hostile as Gorbachev presses on
with his transformation of the Soviet Union into a more democratic
state.
   ``Our tactics are to hold on a couple of months,'' Cekuolis said.

   The Japanese make better cars, the chairman of
Ford Motor Co. says.
   ``If you look at the Japanese, I think we're equal to some and
not as good as the best,'' Harold Poling told The Detroit News in a
story published Sunday. ``Our objective is to get there.''
   Poling said operational costs, not technology, put the Big Three
automakers at a disadvantage.
   ``Can we get plants in the United States to produce vehicles as
inexpensively as the Japanese do? You bet,'' he said. ``But that
requires shutting down your plants and starting from scratch. We
can't do that.
   ``We have a work force, we have retirees, we're committed to
pensions and we're committed to health care. And that gives us a
serious noncompetitive disadvantage going in. We have to deal with
that somehow.''
   Poling's comments contradict Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca, who has appeared in television commercials and vigorously
attacked claims that Japanese cars are better than American-made
cars.

   Soldiers today captured an armed Jordanian
soldier who infiltrated into the occupied West Bank, then
approached an Israeli collective farm and hid near a Palestinian
village, the army said.
   A resident of Kibbutz Naaron, a collective farm about five miles
from the Jordan frontier, said the farm was alerted by the army and
residents stayed awake all night to guard against attack. The
resident spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An army communique said soldiers found evidence of an
infiltration Sunday night and followed the Jordanian's trail as he
approached Kibbutz Naaron, then went to the Arab village of Auja,
about two miles south of the kibbutz.
   It was unclear how near the infiltrator came to the collective
farm. He was captured in a banana grove outside Auja, about five
miles north of Jericho.
   The infiltrator was armed with a U.S.-made M-16 assault rifle,
an ammunition belt and extra cartridges, but he surrendered without
firing any shots, an army spokesman said. He said the infiltrator
was being questioned.
   An army colonel, who was not identified by name, said on Army
radio: ``He had a bullet in the chamber of his gun and tried to
escape, but he had no time to shoot because he was surrounded
immediately.''
   It was the fifth incident along the Jordanian border reported by
the army this year and the second involving a Jordanian soldier.

   Helicopters today began bombing the French

vaccine, aimed at wiping out the disease among red foxes.
   Two choppers began the seven-month operation in southeastern
France near the Swiss border. Others may be added later this month
as the campaign shifts to the Paris region and the north.
   Hundreds of groundworkers will join the $2.6 million campaign,
the nation's largest ever, to stamp out a disease that still
strikes thousands of French citizens a year. Officials say no
European has died from rabies in 10 years.
   French attempts to exterminate foxes with guns, traps and poison
gas were criticized by animal rights groups. Officials undertook
more humanitarian methods four years ago by sowing vaccine around
infected areas.
   The frozen packets are composed of a rabies-vaccine capsule
planted in a ball of fish powder. After they thaw, the packets give
off an odor that even the craftiest fox finds hard to resist.

<HEAD>Pilots, Airlines, Community Groups Agree on Airport Noise
Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots, airlines and community groups have agreed
on a drastic noise reduction plan for Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   Irene Jones, a community leader participating in the talks, said
the accord could cut noise at the airport, known as ``Sea-Tac,'' in
half by 2001.
   ``This is the most comprehensive noise-control program of any
major airport in the country,'' said Paul Dunholter, a noise
consultant with Mestre Greve &amp; Associates of Newport Beach, Calif.
The agreement was reached late Saturday after 17 months of
information-gathering and negotiation.
   Dunholter's firm provided technical assistance to the Sea-Tac
Airport Noise Mediation Committee, a panel of representatives from
airlines, community groups, the Port of Seattle and other
organizations.
   The plan will be submitted to Port of Seattle commissioners on
Thursday. The port owns the airport.
   It would establish a steadily shrinking noise ``budget'' for
airlines, narrow flight corridors over heavily populated areas and
restrict noise during plane maintenance.
   The agreement is unusual because it was designed by
representatives of all groups working together, instead of
piecemeal by lawsuits, said Jerry Cormick, a mediator in the talks.
   ``I'm sure that if any airport tried to to impose the various
things these groups did they'd end up in court in a moment,'' said
Cormick, who is northwest director for The Mediation Institute.
   Cormick, who helped referee the talks, predicted the plan would
serve as a model for airports around the country. He said the
plan's strength lies in its direct, detailed changes to reduce
noise.
   ``It isn't just a set of fuzzy recommendations,'' he said.
   The plan calls for an allowable noise budget for each airline
serving Sea-Tac. The budget shrinks over successive years, as
airlines would be encouraged to acquire newer, quieter planes.
   To reduce ground noise, the agreement calls for less revving of
plane engines at night and bans the use of engines to power a plane
as it backs out of a gate area.
   A noise-abatement committee would be established. It would
include local residents who would help monitor and enforce noise
restrictions.
   One issue the committee could not agree on was an overall flight
plan for the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has
proposed a plan, but Cormick said the committee did not endorse it.
   Cormick said port commissioners were likely to approve the
overall plan. The Port of Seattle spent more than $800,000 on
committee activities and technical assistance.

<HEAD>Second Major Politician Quits Amid Allegations of Stasi Links</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The charismatic head of East Germany's Social
Democratic Party quit his post amid allegations he had links to the
hated Stasi secret police, his party announced today.
   Ibrahim Boehme, who denies the allegations, said he was
resigning because it will take ``lengthy investigations'' to clear
up the accusations, said August Kamilli, a high-ranking Social
Democrat.
   East Germany has been thrown into a political crisis by charges
that many of its politicians had links to the Stasi secret police,
which the former hard-line Communist leaders used to control East
Germany.
   The accusations have seriously overshadowed efforts by the
conservative alliance that won East Germany's March 18 elections to
put together a coalition government with the Social Democrats.
   Boehme became the second top political leader to give up his
post because of allegations of Stasi links.
   Just before the elections, Wolfgang Schnur admitted former ties
to the Communists' secret police and resigned as head of Democratic
Awakening, one of three parties in the Alliance for Germany which
won the elections.
   Boehme announced his resignation in a letter dated Sunday,
Kamilli said.
   He went to the former secret police headquarters in East Berlin
on Friday to look at former classified documents, aiming to clear
his name.
   But according to Kamilli, after viewing the records Boehme
decided a ``speedy clarification'' was impossible and he wanted to
avoid ``burdening the young (East German) democracy and the work of
the party.''
   Boehme's attorney, Friedrich-Wilhelm von Sell, said his client
found no incriminating documents. The news came as a surprise,
because Boehme had said after looking at the records that he would
resume his party post today.
   However, von Sell said ``more documents need to be searched for
and examined.'' He did not elaborate.
   Kamilli said a special party congress will convene to name
Boehme's successor, but did not say when that would occur. Markus
Merkel, the part's deputy chairman, took over in Boehme's absence.
   Lothar de Maiziere, leader of the alliance and the East German
Christian Democrats, has also been accused of having worked with
the secret police, which he denies.
   Manfred Stople, top administrator of East Berlin's Lutheran
Church, last week examined secret police files kept on de Maiziere
and later reported he saw nothing that incriminates the top
Christian Democrat.
   De Maiziere has been trying to forge a coalition with the
left-leaning Social Democrats to ensure a majority in the new
Parliament in order to clear the way for adopting a plan for swift
unification with West Germany.
   The Alliance for Germany finished with the most votes in the
March 18 elections, the Social Democrats came in a distant second,
and the Communists third.

<HEAD>Fleet Returns From Antarctic After Catching 330 Whales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's whaling fleet returned from the Antarctic
Ocean after catching 330 small whales in the third season of a
controversial research program aimed at counting the whale
population, officials said today.
   ``We believe we were able to achieve good scientific results
from the research,'' said Nobuyuki Yagi, a Fishery Agency official,
after the expedition ended Saturday.
   The Japanese government hopes the International Whaling
Commission, which imposed a worldwide moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1986, will decide there are sufficient numbers of some
species to partially lift the ban.
   Japanese whaling officials say the mammals must be killed to
accurately determine their age, sex, diet and health. But
anti-whaling groups call the research a veiled form of commercial
whaling and say skin sampling and other non-lethal research methods
are available.
   Good weather and frequent sightings allowed Japan's four-ship
whaling fleet to catch 30 more non-endangered minke whales than its
original 300-whale quota during the four-month expedition, Yagi
said.
   The research whaling plan allows a 10 percent leeway in the
catch, he said.
   Yagi said Japan will present its findings on numbers, sex and
age to the International Whaling Commission, which currently
estimates there are about 730,000 minkes.
   The commission's moratorium on whaling was passed to allow
scientists to study whale stocks without the disruptions caused by
regular whaling activities.
   The commission's scientific commission is to meet in June to
recommend whether to extend the moratorium, followed by a decision
by the full commission at a meeting scheduled in July.
   ``Even if the scientific committee agrees after studying the
scientific findings that commercial whaling should be resumed,
there is a large possibility that the full commission will reject
it because of opposition within it to whaling,'' Yagi said.
   Many of the 38 nations in the commission do not conduct whaling,
and several are strong whaling opponents. Under the commission's
charter, members are allowed to conduct research whaling whenever
they wish, despite the commercial whaling ban.
   Environmental groups have charged that Japan's research program
is actually commercial whaling in disguise.
   The same boats and facilities are used as in commercial whaling,
and the meat obtained by the research program is sold for food, as
permitted under the commission's regulations.
   Japan halted commercial whaling in the Antarctic at the end of
the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales. It then began a
program of research whaling, which it says is aimed at assessing
whale stocks.
   Japanese whalers killed 273 minke whales in the first year of
the program and 241 last year.
   Japanese whaling officials have said at least 825 whales must be
caught each year to make the research program scientifically
accurate. The quota for the program's first year was initially 875,
but strong opposition from environmental groups and from other
commission members led Japan to reduce the quota to 300.
   In the early 1960s, when Japanese whaling was at its peak,
whales provided about 23 percent of all meat consumed in the
country. Since then, declining whale supplies have turned it into a
delicacy.

   The Duchess of York's sister, Jane Makim, today
accepted substantial undisclosed damages and a public apology from

   The adultery allegations appeared in three stories published in

   The Daily Mirror also ran a story that alleged Mrs. Makim tried
to trick her husband, Alexander Makim, into signing visa papers so
she could take their two children to England. The Makims are
separated and live in Australia.
   Announcing settlement of Mrs. Makim's libel action, her lawyer,
Andrew Caldecott, told Judge Michael Davies at the High Court in
London that the allegations were untrue.
   Mrs. Makim had not been unfaithful to her husband, nor had she
ever plotted to deceive her husband into releasing the children to
her, Caldecott said.
   The articles caused Mrs. Makim considerable distress and
embarrassment, he said.
   Caldecott said the Daily Mirror published a page 5 apology
withdrawing all the allegations and acknowledging that Mrs. Makim's
behavior ``had been entirely proper.''
   Bronwen Fitzpatrick, the lawyer for the Daily Mirror, said the
newspaper accepted that the allegations were untrue and should
never have been published. She said the newspaper was happy to
repeat its ``sincere apology'' for the distress and embarrassment
caused.
   The newspaper will also pay Mrs. Makim's legal costs, Ms.
Fitzpatrick said.
   The Duchess of York, married to Queen Elizabeth II's son, Prince
Andrew, left the hospital Friday after the birth of their second
daughter, Princess Eugenie.

<TEXT>
   Construction spending rose 2.6 percent in
February, the government said today, as unusually warm weather
continued across much of the nation.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $436.5 billion.
   That compared with a revised 2.5 percent gain the previous
month, the warmest January on record. January spending was first
reported last month to have rise 1.8 percent.
   Spending in December, the fourth coldest since the government
began keeping records 96 years ago, had slipped 0.3 percent.
   All three major areas of spending advanced, with residential
construction up 1.7 percent to $198.5 billion after gaining 2.9
percent in January.
   Single-family spending rose 3.9 percent to $123.0 billion after
a 2.8 percent increase the previous month. Apartment construction
advanced 3.4 percent to $21.0 billion after falling 0.5 percent in
January.
   Non-residential spending rose 5.5 percent to $106.4 billion
after a 6.1 percent jump in January. Industrial, office and other
commercial building led the advance.
   The volatile government sector advanced 2.1 percent to $93.8
billion after falling 2.0 percent a month earlier. Schools and
other public buildings as well as highways and streets were the
biggest gainers.
   The total construction spending figure was up 4.8 percent from
the level of building a year ago.

<HEAD>Tenants Finds Dynamite Buried in Backyard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two women unearthed more than 60 sticks of
old dynamite in their back yard and police evacuated a two-block
area for several hours until the bomb squad could remove the highly
unstable explosive.
   The dynamite, discovered by Melinda Costello about 1:30 p.m.
Sunday, was in a rusted metal chest and had no identifying marks.
Police said it was not immediately apparent how long it had been
buried.
   Costello, who has lived in the house for more than five years,
said the dynamite was in a plastic bag and was wet on top. She said
she unwrapped one of the sticks and found the crystallized
substance inside.
   ``My friend and I were digging it up,'' Costello said. ``She was
smoking. We were banging around. I guess we were lucky.''
   Several hundred residents in a two-block radius around the house
in the Bernal Heights neighborhood were evacuated while the bomb
squad removed the explosive, said police Sgt. John Sterling.
   The aged explosive was so unstable it could be triggered by an
electrical charge as small as that emitted from a camera flashbulb,
he said.
   While police searched the backyard with metal detectors, bomb
squad experts soaked the dynamite in diesel fuel to neutralize the
nitroglycerine, Sterling said.
   Costello's roommate, Isabel Saques, said she discovered the box
three or four days ago as she was turning over the soil in her yard
for a garden and struck something hard about a foot down.
   She said she found the metal box under a cement slab but ``left
it because I was tired,'' she said.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Airbag Rulings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand rulings that
protect automobile manufacturers from design-defect lawsuits for
not installing airbags.
   The justices, without comment, refused to revive three such
suits against General Motors, one against Honda and one against
Nissan.
   Three federal appeals courts and a California state court ruled
in favor of the car makers.
   The lower courts relied on federal safety laws that until 1986
did not require any type of passive restraints and now give
manufacturers the option of installing airbags or automatic
seatbelts.
   The issue in each of the four appeals was whether the federal
safety laws pre-empt product-liability suits when the alleged
design defect _ the lack of an airbag _ does not violate federal
standards.
   The justices in 1987 refused to order the government to adopt
tougher standards for installing airbags or automatic seatbelts in
new cars.
   Then-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole adopted a so-called
passive restraint rule in 1984 that phased in the use of airbags or
seatbelts that automatically wrap around front-seat occupants.
   Car makers were required to equip 10 percent of their 1987
models with such devices. The percentage was gradually increased,
and all 1990 model cars are required to have dashboard airbags, at
least on the driver's side, or automatic seatbelts.
   In the cases acted on today, the justices were told that
thousands of design-defect suits are pending against car makers,
``over a hundred of which involve claims concerning passive
restraints.''
   ``The pre-emption issue has been raised or is lurking in every
one of them,'' the court was told.
   Massachusetts resident Patricia Wood sued GM after being left a
quadraplegic from a May 19, 1981, accident. The 1976 GM Blazer in
which she was a passenger struck a tree. She was not wearing a
seatbelt.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out her suit last
December.
   The family of Willard F. Kitts sued GM under New Mexico law
after he was killed in a July 17, 1982, crash. He was wearing the
seatbelt-shoulder harness system in his 1982 Pontiac.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the Kitts
family's suit last May.
   Florida suits were filed against GM and American Honda Motor
Corp., respectively, after Charles Taylor and Paula Evans were
killed in separate two-car collisions. Taylor was driving a 1980
Chevrolet, and Mrs. Evans a 1977 Honda Accord. Legal documents
submitted to the justices did not specify the dates of either
accident.
   Combining their cases, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
threw out both suits last June.
   James R. Meier's family sued Nissan Motor Corp. in California
four years ago after he was killed in a crash of his 1982 Nissan
Stanza.
   A state appeals court dismissed the suit last May.
   Asked by the justices for its views in the Massachusetts case,
the Bush administration said Ms. Wood's appeal should be rejected.
   Justice Department lawyers said the government's policy of
letting car makers ``offer the public a choice of either automatic
seatbelts or airbag passive protection systems ... is likely to be
frustrated if manufacturers are held liable for not installing
airbags.''
   The cases are Wood vs. GM, 89-46; Kitts vs. GM, 89-279; Taylor
vs. GM, 89-852; and Meier vs. Nissan, 89-940.

<HEAD>U.S.-Born Anti-Arab Rabbi Charged With Sedition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane went on trial today
on charges of sedition for calling Arabs a ``cancer spreading in
our midst'' at a rally protesting a bloody attack on Israelis last
year.
   Defense lawyers called the trial a test case for free
expression, and Kahane has won unexpected support from civil
libertarians who argue the sedition law is too broad and vague.
   Kahane, head of the anti-Arab Kach movement and former member of
Parliament, said he didn't regret his July 7 speech.
   ``I admit to the words, and I would say them again at another
rally,'' the 57-year-old Brooklyn-born leader said in an interview
outside the courtroom in Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   Only about 20 Kahane followers and journalists attended the
trial at Jerusalem District Court. Kahane, wearing a black suit and
black skull cap, sat quietly during the four-hour hearing,
occasionally shaking hands with supporters and browsing through his
appointment calendar.
   Defense attorney Zvi Hadar and prosecutor Uzi Hasson did not
address the charges. They instead debated a defense motion that the
trial be dropped because the prosecution forgot to sign the
indictment within six months of the alleged offense, as required by
law.
   Judge Ruth Or reserved her decision and did not set a date for
the next hearing. Kahane is free on his own recognizance.
   At issue is a Kahane rally in Jerusalem on July 7, a day after a
Palestinian from the occupied Gaza Strip grabbed the wheel of an
Israeli bus, plunging it into a steep ravine on the Tel
Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Sixteen people were killed in the attack.
   ``Kill those who come to kill you,'' Kahane told a crowd of
about 1,000 people on July 7. His supporters chanted ``Death to the
Arabs!'' and waved signs demanding that all Arabs be expelled from
Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Kahane is the first Israeli to be prosecuted under the sedition
law in civil court, said defense attorney Aharon Levy. In military
court, the charge was brought three times in the 1950s.
   The law, which stems from the time of the British Mandate,
defines sedition as including speech that promotes ``feelings of
ill-will and enmity among different sectors of the population.''
   The sedition law has been criticized by civil rights advocates,
including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.
   ``The use of the sedition law which really has no bounds and no
safeguards is potentially dangerous to freedom of speech,'' the
association's legal director, Joshua Schoffman, said today. He
declined to comment directly on the Kahane case.
   Kahane served as a member of Israel's Parliament for four years
but was barred from running for re-election in 1988 after
legislators passed a law banning parties that have a racist
platform.
   Kahane founded the militant Jewish Defense League in the United
States in 1968. He renounced his American citizenship to run for
Israel's Parliament.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Delta Air Lines Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
airlines say could make it more difficult for them to merge.
   The court, without comment, refused to shield Delta Air Lines
from binding arbitration that could lead to a monetary-damages
award for a flight attendants union.
   The case stems from Delta's acquisition of Western Airlines in
1986.
   Western agreed in 1984 that, should it merge, the Association of
Flight Attendants would continue to represent Western employees in
any newly formed company.
   Delta's flight attendants were not unionized, and Delta did not
honor Western's union contract after the merger. The union then
sought arbitration to retain its status as bargaining agent or to
win a damage award.
   A federal judge threw out the union's complaint. But the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here reinstated it last July, and ordered
the dispute submitted to arbitration.
   The appeals court rejected Delta's argument that arbitration is
barred by the federal Railway Labor Act governing labor relations
for airlines and railroads.
   The law gives the National Mediation Board power to certify
unions as bargaining agents for airline and railroad workers.
   Delta said the board's authority over union representation
precludes arbitration in this case.
   But the appeals court said, ``Due respect for privately
bargained outcomes cautions against'' freeing airlines from union
contracts signed by the companies they acquire.
   ``The most that can be said in support of Delta's position'' is
that it might prompt an airline to ``forego entering into an
otherwise desirable merger,'' the appeals court said.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject Delta's
appeal.
   Review is not warranted merely because the airlines fear mergers
will be inhibited, Justice Department lawyers said. ``Such concerns
are speculative and, in any event, are not rooted in policies
deriving from the Railway Labor Act.''
   Airline industry groups said the appeals court decision
``creates uncertainty and unpredictability'' for the future of
mergers.
   The case is Delta vs. Association of Flight Attendants, 89-459.

   An intense, predawn fire rolled through a
first-floor apartment today, killing a woman and her three young
children, authorities said.
   The fire in the 2{-story wood-frame tenement in a poor
neighborhood on the Northwest Side was reported about 4:30 a.m.,
said fire department spokesman Tom Sheppard. Firefighters evacuated
a family from the second floor.
   The fire apparently started in the living room, and may have
been caused by an electrical fault, said Deputy District Fire Chief
Robert Datz. The blaze spread rapidly and its intense heat melted a
doorknob, he said.
   The mother's body was found in a doorway leading to a rear
porch, where she apparently was overcome while trying to escape,
and the children were found in bedrooms, Datz said.
   One victim, a 5-year-old girl, died of smoke inhalation at
Children's Memorial Hospital, said nursing supervisor Kathy Canick.
The others were pronounced dead at other hospitals, officials said.

<HEAD>Court Allows Maryland Officials to Revoke License of Day-Care
Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed Maryland
officials to revoke the license of a day-care center where young
children allegedly were abused physically and sexually.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the center's
operator, who said her rights were violated because a psychologist
she hired was not allowed to interview the children.
   The Maryland Department of Human Resources in 1988 revoked the
license of the Bo Peep Day Nursery in Bel Air. State officials said
there was extensive evidence that some of the 80 children attending
the center had been abused.
   The officials relied, in part, on testimony by the children's
parents and by experts who questioned the children and analyzed
their behavior. The children themselves did not testify at a state
agncy hearing conducted before the center's license was revoked.
   Deborah Cassilly, the center's operator, said her right to due
process was violated because the psychologist she hired was not
permitted to talk to the children.
   She also said the center was open at all times to parents, and
that the children were supervised closely. Any abuse of the
children did not occur at the nursery, she testified.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
last year that Mrs. Cassilly's rights were not violated.
   The state court noted that Mrs. Cassilly's lawyers were
permitted to cross-examine all adults who testified about alleged
abuse or who might have influenced any children to describe falsely
what happened at the center.
   The state court also said revoking the center's license did not
involve criminal charges, and therefore Ms. Cassilly was not
entitled to the same procedural protections guaranteed by a court
of law.
   Hearsay evidence _ what the children told psychologists who
examined them _ is admissible in an administrative proceeding, the
state court said.
   The Supreme Court said last January it will decide whether
people prosecuted for alleged child abuse have the right to at
least one face-to-face confrontation with their accusers. The court
will use cases from Maryland and Idaho to define the rights in
criminal cases of those accused of child abuse.
   The case acted on today is Cassilly vs. Maryland Department of
Human Resources, 89-1294.

<HEAD>EC Submits Detailed Plan to Protect Intellectual Property</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community today submitted a detailed
proposal to trade negotiators for new international rules to
protect rights to intellectual property such as patents, copyright
and trademarks.
   The proposal is the most comprehensive presented to date in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and aims to combat
increasing counterfeiting and piracy.
   The EC's draft, to be discussed by negotiators at GATT's
headquarters in Geneva, would protect patents for 20 years to
prevent third parties from making, using or selling a product
without the patent owner's consent.
   Copyrighting, including the rights of authors, performers and
broadcast organizations, is protected for 25 to 50 years and the
initial registration of a trademark would be valid for 10 years
under the proposal.
   New accords on intellectual property rights and 14 other sectors
of world trade are due to be signed by GATT's 96 members in
December at the end of a four-year round of negotiations.
   While the so-called Uruguay Round talks on areas such as
agriculture and textiles are designed to liberalize global
commerce, any agreement on intellectual property is likely to
increase protection.
   The United States, the 12-nation European bloc and Japan have
pressed for more stringent GATT rules. The United States is
expected to submit a similarly detailed proposal on intellectual
property in the next few weeks.
   By contrast, some developing countries led by India have argued
that ready access to knowhow is essential to their development and
that it should not be controlled through GATT.
   Peter Carl Mogens, an EC negotiator, said even though
conventions already existed in these areas, basic rights were not
observed.
   He said the plans for new rules on trademarks were meant to
prevent the sale of counterfeit goods which not only harmed
producers of the genuine product but but often posed a health risk,
as in the case of counterfeit medicines.
   A few internationally agreed rules protect patents, Mogens said,
but some countries, notably India, refused to respect patents for
medicines.
   The EC draft also sets out protective measures for geographical
indications, or appelations of origin, where the quality and
reputation of a product is linked with a country or region.
   Mogens said many countries did not respect an existing
international treaty, citing the example of a Third World country
that imposed an import ban on French champagne while continuing to
sell a home-produced version bearing the same name. He did not name
the country.
   Other areas covered in the EC's proposal are the design of
semiconductors, trade secrets and industrial designs.

   The most popular U.S.-made assault-style
weapon _ the Colt AR15 rifle _ may soon be back on the civilian
market, and some gun control advocates are dismayed at the prospect.
   ``They're putting profits over public safety,'' said Susan
Whitmore of Handgun Control Inc. ``We don't want to see one more
assault weapon on the streets, and this is just going to add to
it.''
   The Colt AR15 was the most popular U.S.-made semiautomatic
assault-style weapon _ rifle or pistol _ when Colt Industries Inc
voluntarily shut down production for the civilian market in March
1989.
   The company took that action a day after the government
temporarily suspended imports of similar foreign-made rifles, and
it never resumed them, according to Mike Dunn, spokesman for Colt
Industries.
   But Colt Firearms Division of the company was sold March 22 to a
group of investors, C.F. Holding, leading to the possible change in
policy.
   Ron Stilwell, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of what is now called Colt's Manufacturing Company, Inc.,
said the company is evaluating whether to start producing AR15s for
the civilian market again.
   ``We are evaluating that,'' Stilwell said in an interview. ``We
will have some formal statements on it in the future.
   ``We firmly believe it is a legitimate sporting system and in
fact the only system that can be used for certain national target
matches,'' he said.
   National Rifle Association lobbyist David Conover said, ``Good
for them,'' when told today about the possible resumption of AR15
production.
   ``I think that there are a lot of law-abiding gun owners out
there who enjoy owning AR15s and certainly use them in competitive
target shooting and recreational target shooting,'' Conover said.
   In 1988, the last full year of production of AR15s for civilian
sale, Colt made 17,368 of the rifles, according to a Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms list.
   Other U.S. manufacturers made 9,411 copies of the Colt AR15 that
year, according to the list. ATF spokesman Jack Killorin said he
did not know if those manufacturers boosted production last year to
fill the market for AR15s.
   In all, the list showed that domestic manufacturers produced
about 80,000 assault-style weapons in 1988, about half of which
were rifles with the same characteristics as foreign weapons banned
from import last year.
   ``Why on earth would any civilized society allow the manufacture
and over-the-counter sales of any rifle or pistol designed to
accept silencers or bayonets?'' asked Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., a
gun control advocate who sought the information from ATF. He
released the list on Sunday.
   ``What's a bayonet for ... charging deer?'' asked Stark.
   The list included 38,108 rifles and an unknown number of Quality
Parts Bushmaster rifles and Ruger Mini 14s. It also lists 40,093
pistols, although the ban on imports did not include pistols.
   First on the list in total production was the Colt AR15,
followed by Intratec Tec 9 pistol at 13,770 and the SWD MAC-11
pistol at 12,273.
   The 26 types of weapons had at least one of the following
assault-type characteristics: threaded barrels to accommodate a
silencer, flash suppressors that could hide the shooter's position
at night and prevent a loss of night vision, provisions for
mounting a bayonet or folding or collapsible stocks.
   The ATF listed such characteristics when it defined 43 types of
foreign-made guns as ``semiautomatic assault rifles'' that it
banned from import last July.
   ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins, in announcing the ban, said a
study had found that the models were ``not being used for sporting
uses,'' a requirement for imports.
   Two weeks ago, the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime
approved a bill that would outlaw domestic assault-style weapons.
The bill introduced by Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., outlaws
domestic and foreign-made assault-style rifles as well as domestic
and imported assault-style pistols which can accept a silencer or a
bayonet. The measure, passed 5-3, awaits action in the House
Judiciary Committee.
   National Rifle Association lobbyist Dave Conover said the 80,000
figure from the ATF ``would tell me they're being fairly narrow in
their interpretation of what would be a prohibited firearm.''
   The NRA estimates there are a total of 3.5 million to 4 million
military-style semiautomatic firearms in U.S. circulation.
   To Whitmore of Handgun Control, however, the total ``points up
so clearly that Congress has to act quickly. These things are
flooding the market.''

   A car veered across a dividing line on a
two-lane highway, slid and broadsided another car, killing six
people, authorities said.
   ``I was just down the road assisting some folks with their van
when I heard someone let out a scream and I looked to see what it
was,'' said Sgt. Lloyd Gabbert of the California Highway Patrol.
   Gabbert said he saw the two cars collide on the shoulder of the
highway in western Stanislaus County, east of San Francisco, and
jump about 8 feet into the air. The accident occurred at about 4
p.m. Sunday.
   Officers said they did not know why the eastbound car crossed
into the westbound lane of Highway 132 near Modesto.
   A Hayward family died in the eastbound car, and two men from
Modesto were killed in the other car.

   A 30-mile fuel slick drifting down the
Allegheny River today threatened the drinking water supply for
about 1 million people, and some schools were closed to conserve
water.
   One town of 15,000 people already had to have water trucked in.
Other communities drew water from tributaries to the Allegheny,
rather than the river itself, to build up reserves.
   The slick resulted from a landslide that broke a pipeline Friday
and released 85,000 to 98,000 gallons of gasoline, kerosene and
other fuels near Freeport.
   Pittsburgh joined with other communities in calling for
voluntary conservation of water as it prepared to close its
treatment plant. Other treatment centers upstream were already
closed.
   ``We know we're next and we're just waiting for it to get to
us,'' said Pittsburgh Water Department spokeswoman Donna
Sagmeister. The city's system serves 500,000 people.
   Classes for about 18,600 students in six Pittsburgh area school
districts were cancelled today to conserve water.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey declared a state of emergency Sunday in the
area of the spill.
   ``We believe we have in place a process and procedure to assure
a continued water supply to all affected areas,'' Casey said.
   Officials flew over the area to search for the leading edge of
the slick today but could not immediately determine how far it was
from the city, said Pittsburgh Public Safety spokeswoman Margaret
Philbin.
   ``There's a definite sheen farther up the Allegheny River, and a
slight sheen was spotted closer to us this morning, but we're not
sure if it's from the spill or from another source,'' she said.
   Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff said her city had more than
three days worth of pure water in its reservoir. Conservation could
stretch that by two days, she said.
   The spill threatened the water supply for about 1 million
residents of communities along the Allegheny and Ohio rivers. The
Allegheny and the Monongahela join at Pittsburgh to form the Ohio
River.
   Normal water service was shut off to the 15,000 residents of
Harrison Township, and water was sent in Sunday by truck, said Nat
Mastro, deputy county fire marshal.
   Preparations were also made in Beaver County, which is on the
Ohio River northwest of Pittsburgh.
   Beaver County Emergency Services Director Russell Chiodo said he
was advising eight water authorities serving about 40,000 people to
begin saving water.
   ``We want them to be conservative as all heck right now,'' he
said. ``We don't know what's going to happen.''
   Buckeye Pipeline Co. estimated it lost up to 98,000 gallons of
fuel from its 10-inch pipeline, which extends from Linden, N.J., to
the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The company said cleanup
workers using floating booms and absorbent pads recovered about 20
percent of the fuel.
   Dennis Vrotny, emergency management director for Brackenridge
upstream, said his community and others were drawing water from
tributaries to the Allegheny to add to their reservoirs. Fire
departments were pumping as much water out of creeks as possible,
he said, but cooperation from residents was essential.
   Vrotny said the water system in Brackenridge, a community of
about 4,000, serves 30,000 people. ``I don't think it's going to
hold if people don't conserve now,'' Vrotny said. ``As it is, we're
losing ground fast.''

   Donald Trump today opened the
Boardwalk's newest casino, and several hundred would-be high
rollers flocked inside to slap down play money on the gaming tables
and feed real coins to the slot machines.
   The Taj Mahal Casino Hotel Resort, named for India's sacred 16th
century mausoleum, opened in a steady drizzle and a deluge of
publicity.
   ``Turnout is great, considering the weather,'' Trump said,
flanked by three bodyguards as he walked the 120,000-square foot
casino floor and greeted employees.
   About 50 state gaming investigators would be checking that
dealers know their games and that proper internal controls,
surveillance and accounting procedures are in place, said Anthony
Parrillo, director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement.
   The slot machines accepted real coins but gamblers at the tables
_ craps, roulette, baccarat _ had to forego gambling with real
money until the state inspectors determine that casino workers are
following proper procedures.
   Two state Casino Control Commissioners assigned to supervise the
opening will evaluate each department's performance today and
decide whether the casino needs another ``play day.''
   Parrillo said the average for the 12 casinos that have opened in
the city has been two days of ``play money'' followed by two days
of permitting small wagers.
   The state already has tested the casino in items ranging from
the arcane _ security's response to a hostage situation _ to the
mundane _ whether the fire alarms work. Employees used Friday and
Saturday nights to test their fellow workers at the tables.
   Parrillo said the Trump Organization has experience in opening
Atlantic City casinos, but the sheer size of the Taj Mahal _ a
third larger than its biggest competitor here _ leaves room for
more mistakes.
   The Trump Castle Casino By The Bay opened June 17, 1985, and
accepted limited cash bets the next day, but the Trump Plaza Hotel
and Casino had a rockier road when it opened May 14, 1984.
   Trump Plaza also went to limited cash betting the next day, but
went nearly two weeks at 50 percent capacity before the gambling
hall voluntarily shut to retrain gaming table employees.

<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts church lost a Supreme Court
appeal today over its claim that religious freedom will be violated
if state approval is required for its school's curriculum.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the New
Life Baptist Church Academy in East Longmeadow, Mass., must submit
for approval the non-religious education its students receive.
   New Life Baptist, a fundamentalist church founded in 1977, began
operating a school in 1981 to provide a religiously based education
for the children of its members.
   State law requires all private schools to offer _ in addition to
any religious training _ a secular, or non-religious, education
comparable to that provided in public schools.
   Under state law, the church was required to seek the approval of
a local school committee for the school's academic program.
   New Life Baptist's leaders believe it is a sin to seek such
state approval for the school.
   The church does not object to all state regulation, such as
assuring that the school meets health and safety requirements. But
lawyers for the church argued that subjecting the school's
educational mission to state regulation was too intrusive on
religious principles. said state officials should devise some less intrusive
way,
such as standardized testing, to assure that New Life Baptist
Academy students are receiving a proper education in non-religious
subjects.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Wolf's ruling
last September.
   The appeals court said Wolf's suggested alternatives would not
be any less intrusive, and that the local school committee's
proposed method of gathering information for its approval decision
does not threaten religious freedom.
   In the appeal acted on today, New Life Baptist lawyers urged the
justices to strike ``a balanced protection for the church as well
as the state.''
   The appeal argued that in this case ``the government ... has
leaped the wall of separation and it is the church crying out for
protection.''
   The case is New Life Baptist Church Academy vs. East Longmeadow,
89-1118.

   Republican Party chief Lee Atwater was
admitted to a New York hospital today for additional treatment
designed to ``minimize the potential aggressiveness'' of a
non-malignant tumor on the right side of his brain.
   Atwater's top deputy at the Republican National Committee, Mary
Matalin, said in a statement that Atwater entered New York's
Montefiore Medical Center for a procedure know as a interstitial
radiation implantation.
   The procedure involves inserting a radioactive isotope into the
tumor, for which Atwater twice has been hospitalized for treatment
in the past month. The statement said the procedure involves local
anesthesia and that the isotope would be implanted for five days.
   ``Consultations with the top brain tumor specialists in the
country resulted in a consensus diagnosis that Lee has a small,
treatable (tumor) located in the right frontal lobe,'' Ms. Matalin
said in the statement. ``After in-depth examination and evaluation,
doctors determined that the tumor has the potential to behave
aggressively.''
   The statement said Atwater, after hearing the diagnosis, opted
to have the treatment, described in the statement as the ``state-of
the art method of radiation treatment.''
   It said results of the procedure would not be known for eight to
12 weeks.
   But one of the doctors involved in the treatment was optimistic.
   ``Mr. Atwater's age and excellent physical condition, together
with the early diagnosis of the tumor, its size and location, offer
favorable circumstances for successful results,'' said Dr. Paul L.
Kornblith, a neurosurgeon.
   Atwater, 39, has been receiving radiation treatments virtually
daily since the tumor was diagnosed March 6 after he collapsed
while giving a speech at a political event.
   He returned to work just days after the first episode but was
hospitalized again 10 days ago, for two days, after complaining of
queasiness. A Republican National Committee statement said doctors
attributed Atwater's queasiness to a medication imbalance.
   After the first episode, Atwater said he was told he would have
to undergo daily radiation treatments. His doctors had ruled out
surgery for the tumor.
   Atwater's doctors have not explained that decision but other
physicians have said surgery often is ruled out because of the
location of tumors.
   The source said Atwater was ``very upbeat'' Sunday in talking
about plans to undergo the treatment.
   Atwater was named RNC chairman after managing the successful
Bush presidential campaign. He also had worked on both Reagan-Bush
campaigns.
   In an interview after being released from the hospital the first
time, Atwater said, ``I fooled myself into thinking I was
indestructible. I realize now I'm down here on someone else's
turf.''

<HEAD>Court to Decide Issue of Huge Punitive Damage Awards in Alabama
Case</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether huge punitive damage awards in lawsuits may violate
constitutional guarantees of fundamental fairness.
   The court said it will consider overturning a $1 million award
and three smaller awards to Alabama residents who successfully sued
an insurance company for fraud.
   The case, of enormous importance to American business, is likely
to be decided in 1991.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Let stand rulings that protect automobile manufacturers from
design-defect lawsuits for not installing airbags.
   The justices, without comment, refused to revive three such
suits against General Motors, one against Honda and one against
Nissan. Three federal appeals courts and a California state court
ruled in favor of the car makers.
   _ Left intact a ruling airlines say could make it more difficult
for them to merge.
   The court, without comment, refused to shield Delta Air Lines
from binding arbitration that could lead to a monetary-damages
award for a flight attendants union.
   _ Turned away an appeal by a Massachusetts church that says its
religious freedom will be violated if state approval is required
for its school's curriculum.
   The justices, without commewnt, let stand a ruling that the New
Life Baptist Church Academy in East Longmeadow, Mass., must submit
for approval the non-religious education its students receive.
   _ Allowed Maryland officials to revoke the license of a day-care
center where young children allegedly were abused physically and
sexually.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the center's
operator, who said her rights were violated because a psychologist
she hired was not allowed to interview the children.
   The justices ruled last year that huge awards in civil suits,
often millions of dollars, do not violate the Constitution's ban on
excessive fines. But the court left open the possibility that such
awards, intended to punish wrongdoers, may be so disproportionate
to the actual harm that they violate due-process rights.
   The Constitution says states may not deprive anyone of property
without due process of law. Those wishing to limit damage awards
say due process prohibits unlimited discretion by judges and juries.
   In the case acted on today, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.
was found by a jury to have participated in fraud by one of its
agents, Lemmie Ruffin.
   Employees of Roosevelt City, Ala., paid health insurance
premiums to Ruffin which he pocketed, according to court records.
   Cleopatra Haslip, a city worker who had been paying premiums,
incurred $2,500 in hospital and medical bills in 1982 and then
learned her insurance had been cancelled by Pacific Mutual.
   The hospital demanded $600 before agreeing to discharge her and
her doctor eventually turned her case over to a collection agency.
Her credit also suffered from her inability to pay the bills.
   Mrs. Haslip and other members of the insurance plan sued Pacific
Mutual and Ruffin, and a jury in 1987 awarded her $1,040,000. Three
others were awarded $10,288, $12,400 and $15,290.
   It is not clear from records filed with the Supreme Court how
much of the money was intended to compensate the workers for actual
losses and how much was designed to punish the insurance company.
   The Alabama Supreme Court upheld the awards last year. The state
court said, ``Jury verdicts are presumed correct and that
presumption is strengthened when the presiding judge refuses to
grant a new trial.''
   Pacific Mutual said its constitutional rights were violated
because the jury was allowed to award damages ``as a matter of
moral discretion without adequate standards as to the amount
necessary to punish and deter.''
   The company also said it is the victim of unfair discrimination
because Alabama law limits punitive damages in some cases,
including usury and some areas of consumer fraud.
   The case is Pacific Mutual vs. Haslip, 89-1279.

   President Saddam Hussein today admitted
that Iraq has sophisticated binary chemical weapons and warned that
if Israel attacked it Iraq will retaliate and destroy half of the
Jewish state.
   In a speech broadcast by the state-run radio, Saddam denied Iraq
had nuclear weapons and that sophisticated devices bought from the
United States were meant for nuclear weapons development.
   In a statement issued after Saddam's speech, the Iraqi foreign
ministry denied that Iraq was trying to develop nuclear weapons and
said such charges were intended to prevent it from obtaining
``scientific and technical know-how.''
   Saddam lashed out at Western criticism of what U.S. and British
authorities said were clandestine efforts by Baghdad to smuggle
parts for nuclear weapons and over the March 15 execution of
British-based reporter Farzad Bazoft on spying charges.
   Saddam said Bazoft, a reporter for the London Observer weekly,
was a spy and that ``Iraq will chop the heads off spies.''
   Israel condemned Saddam's comments on chemical weapons.
   ``It is high time for the civilized world to act in unity and
see to it that Mr. Saddam Hussein will not have the possibility to
pursue his irresponsible and criminal designs,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud in Jerusalem.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Israel had ``no aggressive intention against anyone, including
Iraq.''
   Asked about the possibility of a preemptive strike against Iraq
to neutralize the chemical threat, he said: ``We don't even want to
talk about that kind of thing.''
   Israeli aircraft attacked and damaged a French-built Iraqi
nuclear reactor near Baghdad in June 1981. Israel claimed Iraq was
using it to develop nuclear weapons. Baghdad denied the charge.
   British authorities arrested several Iraqis in London last week
as they allegedly tried to smuggle krytrons, or electronic devices
used to trigger nuclear weapons, from the United States.
   In his first public comment on the arrests, Saddam denied claims
that Iraq intended to use the devices for atomic weapons.
   He said the devices were ``only condensors which we bought for
$10,500 and it's not logical that these could be used in atomic
bombs.''
   But he defended Iraq's right to build unconventional weapons.
   ``I categorically deny that we have any atomic bombs, but let
them (Iraq's critics) hear here and now that we do possess binary
chemical weapons, which only the United States and the Soviet Union
also have,'' he declared.
   These weapons contain two relatively safe compounds which are
mixed shortly before release to create lethal toxic gases.
   It was believed to be the first time the Iraqi leader has
admitted that his country possesses binary weapons, although
Western intelligence agencies have long said the Iraqis were
developing such weapons at top-secret installations.
   In a clear reference to Israel, believed to be the Middle East's
only nuclear power, Saddam said: ``Those who are threatening us
with nuclear bombs, we warn them that we will hit them with these
binary chemical weapons.''
   ``I also say that if Israel dares to hit even one piece of steel
on any industrial site, we will make the fire eat half of Israel,''
he said.
   Saddam claimed that criticism of his country was intended to
intimidate Iraq and ``to pave the way for Israel to attack us.''
   Iraqi officials admitted they used some types of chemical
weapons during the 1980-88 war with Iran, but claimed they used
them in self-defense.
   They deny widespread allegations by governments and human rights
groups that they used chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925
Geneva protocol, against their Kurdish minoity in areas held by
Kurdish separatist guerrillas.
   Almost 100,000 Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey in August 1988
claiming that Iraqi warplanes were dropping chemical weapons on
their villages.
   Iraq has warned Israel several times in the past two years
against launching pre-emptive strikes against its burgeoning arms
industry that Baghdad now says is capable of producing long-range
missiles and rockets capable of putting satellites into orbit.
   In December, Iraq announced it had tested two long-range
missiles with ranges of up to 1,200 miles, enough to reach either
Tehran or Tel Aviv.
   Israeli officials said a pre-emptive strike is unlikely despite
Iraq's development of missile technology.
   Saddam's fierce rhetoric comes amid growing Arab frustrations
with Israel's refusal to enter peace talks with the Palestinians
and an expected flood of tens of thousands of Soviet Jewish
emigrants to Israel following Moscow's easing of travel
restrictions.
   Saddam claimed that during the war, ``Iraq was offered enriched
uranium and even a complete atomic bomb by people who were either
American, British or Zionist agents. But Iraq turned down these
offers.''
   He gave no details.

   Manuel Noriega's defense attorneys showed
television footage of the U.S. invasion of Panama today, and called
a former U.S. attorney general to the stand as they argued that his
drug case should be dropped.
   The video footage showed scenes of buildings in flames,
shootouts and wounded and dead bodies. Defense attorney Frank
Rubino said the scenes depicted ``outrageous conduct on the part of
the U.S. government.''
   Rubino said the video was put together by his staff from reports
on the invasion by the U.S. television networks and a Panama City
station.
   Government attorneys objected to much of Rubino's presentation,
calling it out of place. But Rubino said it shows Noriega was
brought to this country in a ``shocking'' way, a legal standard he
says mandates that the 1988 drug case against Noriega be dismissed
by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   Earlier, when both sides were complaining about delays in
exchanging discovery information, Hoeveler told the attorneys he
wouldn't allow such issues to postpone Noriega's trial. It is set
to begin Jan. 28, 1991.
   Ramsey Clark, former U.S. attorney general, testified about
reports of mass graves and seeing body bags, some with more than
one body in them, during an independent inquiry he made in Panama.
   In pre-hearing papers filed with the court, the defense cites
``conduct by the United States government shocking to the
conscience and in violation of the laws and norms of humanity.''
   Clark claims civilian deaths following the Dec. 20 military
action numbered in the thousands, rather than in the hundreds, as
the Defense Department has stated. It also includes reports that
civilians, and in some cases the press, were deliberately targeted
by U.S. soldiers.
   Key to the defense arguments is a 1974 case called United States
vs. Toscanino, in which a federal appeals court ruled that shocking
behavior in the arrest of a defendant, even outside the United
States, could be grounds for freeing him.
   Noriega attorney John May said that U.S. abuses during the
invasion were sufficiently shocking to require a dismissal.
   ``Nothing General Noriega is accused of could ever justify such
a deliberate taking of human life,'' the dismissal motion said.
``If ever there were a case where our courts must act to deter such
conduct from occurring again, such a case is this.''
   The U.S. Attorney's office here defends the invasion.
   It calls the civilian deaths ``an unfortunate, unavoidable
byproduct'' of any military action in an urban area. The
prosecutors also question the findings and integrity of the
investigatory commission.
   ``We believe that the report of that organization is
extraordinarily biased and inaccurate in many respects,'' says the
response filed by prosecutors Michael Sullivan and Myles Malman.
   But there is no need to debate the invasion, the prosecutors
say, because the U.S. Supreme Court has never accepted the
Toscanino rule.
   In fact, they say, the high court recently ruled in United
States vs. Verdugo-Urquidez that the Fourth Amendment protection
against illegal search and seizure does not apply to non-citizens
outside the country, the prosecutors say.
   The defense had subpoenaed Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to testify today, but U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler quashed the subpoena.
   The subpoena had asked Powell to produce civilian and military
casualty predictions made prior to the invasion, reports on
civilian deaths, lists of weapons used and any information on
``management of the press.''
   Noriega faces 145 years in prison if convicted of a variety of
drug counts in a 1988 indictment that accused him of accepting
bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a
way station for U.S.-bound cocaine.

   John E. List stopped the mail and the
papers, wrapped up his affairs, then ``systematically executed''
his family of five 18 years ago and disappeared, a prosecutor said
in opening List's murder trial today.
   List, a former Sunday school teacher, devised a plan that
``turned into a day of horror'' at the family's 18-room mansion in
Westfield, said Brian Gillet, an assistant Union County prosecutor.
   ``This defendant systematically executed his wife Helen, his
wife of almost 20 years; his 84-year-old mother Alma, his daughter
Patricia; his son Frederick; his son John. All his own flesh and
blood,'' Gillet said.
   In reviewing evidence the jury would hear, Gillet said List left
notes at the children's school and employer, saying the family had
to go to North Carolina. He also stopped mail delivery and canceled
newspaper subscriptions.
   Like the accountant he was, List ``closed the books, balanced
out the accounts before he fled and took on a new life,'' assuming
another identity almost immediately, Gillet said.
   ``John E. List was buried long before Alma, Helen, Patricia,
Frederick and John were laid to rest,'' the prosecutor said.
   Until today, defense attorney Elijah L. Miller Jr. said little
publicly about how he plans defend List on five counts of first
degree murder.
   His opening statements said the killings had to be viewed as the
product of a ``fragmented'' man unable to deal with changing times.
   List, a war veteran, began to see ``failure at every turn'' in
an age of rebellion and changing morals.
   He saw his family disintegrating and falling from their
religion, but he had to do something under church teachings that he
was charged with their salvation, Miller said.
   ``He committed these acts with love in his heart,'' said Miller.
``For the salvation of his family, he had to act as he did.''
Miller said that he would trace List's past to show ``these
killings are something other than murders.''
   Miller said List still suffers from a mental disease. He argued
that List's ``diminished capacity'' could let the jury return a
conviction on a lesser charge.
   On Dec. 7, 1971, police found the bodies of List's 45-year-old
wife; his mother; and the children, Patricia, 16, John Jr., 15, and
Frederick, 13. Police said the family was killed Nov. 9, 1971.
   For 18 years investigators pursued the case, but it was a
segment about the killings on the TV show ``America's Most Wanted''
that got List back to New Jersey.
   Investigators said shortly after List fled New Jersey he assumed
the identity of Robert P. Clark and lived in the Denver area,
gradually assuming his old life, working as an accountant and
joining local Lutheran churches.
   He moved to the Richmond, Va., suburb of Midlothian in 1987 with
the woman he married in 1985.
   A former Virginia neighbor saw the TV segment and had her
son-in-law call the program. List was arrested June 1 in Richmond.

<TEXT>
   The United States is contributing $100 million
to a $400 million bridge loan for Venezuela, the Treasury
Department announced today.
   ``United States participation in this arrangement reflects
continuing support for Venezuela's strong comprehensive economic
reform package which is being implemented with the support of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,'' the Treasury said
in a statement.
   ``This support comes at a time when Venezuela and the commercial
banks have recently reached agreement in principle on a medium-term
finance and debt-reduction package,'' it continued.
   ``We welcome this agreement, which should provide new money as
well as the potential for significant debt and debt service
reduction in support of Venezuela's strong economic program.''
   The Treasury said the loan would be repaid with future
disbursements from the IMF and the World Bank.

   President Bush today made a pitch for Atlanta to
host the 1996 Summer Olympics and promised not to let politics
intrude ``no matter what's happening.''
   Bush, after addressing a broadcasters convention, visited a
scale-model exhibit of new and existing sport facilities that the
Atlanta Organizing Committee has promised in its bid to win the
Games.
   Bush greeted several members of the International Olympic
Committee who were here checking out what Atlanta had to offer.
   ``I don't want to put the hard sell on anybody, but I feel very
strongly about it, and I also believe it is very good for the
Olympics to ... come to the United States right often,'' Bush said.
   The United States boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow to
protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union in
turn stayed away from the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
   ``We've got to keep politics out of the Olympic Games and we
will try very hard to do it. ...,'' Bush said.
   ``No matter what's happening out there, I'd like to see us keep
it out of the Olympic Games,'' said the president, an avid
sportsman himself.
   Billy Payne, head of the Atlantic Olympic committee, said a
decision is due Sept. 18 and he views Athens, Greece; Melbourne,
Australia and Toronto, as Atlanta's main competition.

   A car bomb exploded outside the
National Police Academy while cadets were doing their morning
exercise today, killing six people and wounding 27, the armed
forces said.
   One police officer, four cadets and a civilian died in the 6:30
a.m. blast, the armed forces press office said in a statement.
Twenty-four cadets and three civilians were wounded.
   The armed forces blamed the attack on urban commandos of the
leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has been
at war with a series of U.S.-backed governments for a decade.
   The attack occurred outside the National Police Academy, eight
miles from the capital in the town of Santa Tecla.

<HEAD>Taxpayers Paid $2.3 Million to Defend Operators Of Rocky Flats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has paid about $2.3 million
since 1979 for legal fees of Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
operators, who were sued on behalf of workers allegedly killed or
injured by radiation, a newspaper reported today.
   Yet total damages sought by seven widows and one living worker
whose cases have come to trial is only about $1 million, The Denver
Post said.
   The Post quoted federal records which show the government's
share of that potential liability is less than $400,000. The rest
of the claims would have been paid out of a state fund created by
Colorado employers.
   To date, two widows have won workers' compensation lawsuits,
collecting a total of about $60,000. A third case has been settled
out of court for an estimated $10,000.
   In each case, the government has argued that the workers' deaths
and cancers were caused by something other than exposure to
on-the-job radiation.
   The inspector general of the Department of Energy, which owns
the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, will conduct an informal
review to determine if the legal fees are justified, said Rob
Jacques, an assistant to the inspector general.
   The legal fee records, obtained by The Denver Post through the
Freedom of Information Act, show that the money was paid by the
plant's two previous operators _ Dow Chemical and Rockwell
International Corp. _ to the Denver law firm of Martinez &amp; Allman.
The Department of Energy then reimbursed the plant operators.
   Attorneys Robert Allman and Larry Martinez said the key legal
decisions in each case were made by their clients _ the plant
operators and the Energy Department.
   Federal records show the two lawyers billed an average of nearly
$30,000 a month from June 1984 through January 1990, even though
most of the official legal appearances, hearings and appeals were
concluded before June 1984.
   During 1986 and 1987, state records show almost no formal legal
proceedings took place on any of the cases. Yet the lawyers charged
the government $341,000 and $273,000 for each year, respectively.
   Between 1979 and June 1984, the government spent roughly
$425,000 defending its operators, the records show. Since then, the
government has paid almost $1.9 million on legal fees.
   According to Bruce DeBoskey, the Denver lawyer who has
represented each of the widows and workers filing cases against
Rocky Flats, Martinez and Allman routinely turned down offers to
settle cases for less than what was being claimed and only settled
one case in which a living Rocky Flats worker was the claimant.
   ``This appears to be the last vestige of an official government
policy to defeat the claims of the widows of Rocky Flats workers
regardless of the cost or the consequences to the taxpayers or to
the workers' compensation system,'' DeBoskey said.
   DeBoskey was the first lawyer in the nation to successfully
prove in court that exposure to permissible levels of radiation at
a nuclear weapons plant contributed to the cancer death of an
employee.

<TEXT>
   County legislators slapped together a
financial package to rescue Buffalo's transit system early today,
but the transit authority did not approve the plan. About 120,000
bus and subway riders were forced to find other means of
transportation.
   The city's 6-year-old, 6-mile subway and its 1,115-mile bus
network serving Buffalo and Niagara Falls made their last runs
early Sunday, hours after the transit agency ran out of money and
became the first federally subsidized mass transit system in the
United States to fail.
   An agreement to finance the agency was announced around dawn by
Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski.
   But the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority commissioners
failed to vote on the package after meeting for more than an hour
this morning. Five of the seven commissioners present spoke out
against the plan, which called for a 10-cent fare increase to
$1.10, suspension of weekend service and the layoffs of 125 of 600
bus drivers.
   The commissioners recessed their meeting indefinitely after
Gorski announced that an aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo indicated some
state aid might be available to get the transit system running.
Commissioners said they wanted to know more about that possibility.
   In Albany, Cuomo spokeswoman Anne Crowley said she knew nothing
about the possibility of the state stepping in.
   Teachers threatened a court fight on behalf of high school
students who use the mass transit system.
   ``The shutdown of the system deprives 11,000 Buffalo high school
students of transportation,'' said Philip Rumore, president of the
Buffalo Teachers Federation.
   The union said Sunday it would try to force the transit
authority back into business by going to federal court and claiming
the shutdown cripples a court-ordered school desegregation program
begun in 1976.
   Public and private schools in New York's second-largest city
were open today, and Buffalo's 25,000 elementary students rode
privately contracted buses as usual.
   Rumore said attendance in Buffalo high schools was 50 percent of
normal.
   Motorists didn't face big-city style gridlock. Buffalo, with a
population of about 324,000, ``doesn't have that type of traffic.
But people can expect at least a half-hour delay coming into the
city,'' Parking Board director Thomas Gallagher said.
   The evening commute could be worse, with road work closing or
restricting lanes on three major roads out of downtown.
   Gallagher said about 65 percent of the 55,000 to 58,000 people
who work downtown commute by car and there are about 24,000 parking
spaces downtown.
   If most of the people who use public transportation don't stay
home, ``We couldn't handle everybody coming in,'' Gallagher said.
   One woman, Tennizee High, said she walked an hour and a half to
get to her downtown job. ``Everybody was walking together with
sneakers on,'' she said. ``Can you believe it?''
   Cathy Wlodarczyk, manager of a Burger King, said all her
employees got to work this morning. ``We had it planned ahead of
time who was supposed to pick up whom. Most of them walked,'' she
said.
   Gorski offered on Saturday night to release $2 million in
emergency funds, but the transit authority refused to consider the
offer because it didn't address long-range funding for the system.
   The county legislature last week voted against a utility tax
that would have provided $9 million annually toward operating the
system.
   The system cost $55 million a year to run, and the costs weren't
covered by a combination of farebox revenues and grants from the
county, state and federal governments.
   Cuomo said Sunday that until a long-term source is found, there
is nothing the state can do to help. The governor said the Erie
County legislature had reneged on its pledge to find the long-term
funds.
   A promise to obtain such a source was one reason the federal
government agreed to pay about $500 million to build the subway.
   ``They've had over two years and they haven't acted on it,''
said bus driver Ziggy Kucewicz, who handed out buttons that played
on the acronym for the transit authority: ``NFTA _ No Funding
Today? Adios.''
   ``If the system shuts down, I think it's on their shoulders,''
he said.

   Scores of rioting prison inmates
surrendered to authorities today and guards retook half of a
Victorian prison devastated by an uprising that one politician
called the worst this century.
   Forty-nine guards and prisoners were injured in the rioting
Sunday at the medium-security Strangeways prison, one of Europe's
most crowded. Today, the prison looked like the scene of a bombing,
said Ivor Serle, a chapter chairman of the Prison Officers'
Association.
   ``The prison is wrecked inside and will have to be virtually
rebuilt,'' he said. ``It is like a building that has been blitzed.''
   Firefighters working under police protection brought under
control fires set in the chapel and a gymnasium, but smoke still
billowed from one corner of the building.
   About a dozen inmates were huddled on the shattered roof of a
100-foot-high prison building in the rain this morning,
occasionally shouting abuse and hurling roof tiles into the yard
below.
   Some wore prison officers shirts, and several were wrapped in
green prison blankets. A helicopter clattered overhead continually
in this northern industrial city.
   Earlier, eyewitnesses said one prisoner climbed up on the roof
dangling a police officer's riot shield as a trophy.
   The Home Office said all but 119 of the prison's 1,648 inmates
had surrendered by late morning. Guards seized half of the facility
without a fight, but inmates still controlled five of the prison's
10 wings, Serle said.
   Serle said reports that 12 sex offenders were killed by other
prisoners could not be confirmed. He said no bodies had been found.
All guards were accounted for and no hostages were taken.
   Prisoners on the roof raised a flag late this afternoon saying
``No Dead,'' but Home Secretary David Waddington told the House of
Commons that the possibility of deaths ``cannot be ruled out.''
   Nine surrendering prisoners claimed to have been forcibly
injected with drugs by other inmates, Waddington said.
   The Home Office said 1,458 inmates had been transferred to
prisons throughout the country and 69 were awaiting transportation
to other facilities.
   ``The riot is the worst prison disturbance this century,'' said
a Labor Party spokesman, Barry Sheerman. ``Strangeways is a ghastly
place and conditions there are very difficult for the inmates and
the staff.''
   Strangeways, an imposing red-brick and sandstone facility, was
built in 1868 for 970 men, and three inmates are often crammed into
a cell meant for one.
   There was no clear indication of what caused the rioting, which
began during Sunday morning service in the prison chapel when
inmates grabbed keys from guards and used them to gain access to
large areas of the facility.
   The Rev. Noel Proctor, an Anglican minister who conducted the
service, said one inmate grabbed the microphone.
   ``He started shouting at some of the lads and they started
acting on and shouting back. He was shouting obscenities and things
like, `This is our opportunity.'''
   Initially, police managed only to reach the chapel, evacuating
the injured using plastic shields to protect them from roof tiles
hurled by prisoners.
   John Bartell, president of the Prison Officers' Association,
accused the government of ``criminal negligence.'' He said it was
known from Saturday that disturbances would break out, but that
only five officers were on duty in the prision chapel when the
rioting broke out.
   David Evans, also of the association, described the prison as a
``war zone,'' He said injured guards taken from the prison said
some prisoners were killed.
   ``I do not know how many but there have been people lying
prostrate and not moving for hours,'' he said.
   Twelve staff and 37 inmates were treated for injuries at
hospitals, Home Office spokesman Charles Keseru said.
   Evans said prison guards were injured trying to defend inmates
from fellow prisoners. He said guards had complained for years
about squalor and overcrowding at Strangeways and other 19th
century jails.
   George Elliot, a spokesman for the guards' association, said 110
officers were on duty at the prison over the weekend, compared with
350 on an average weekday.
   Judge Stephen Tumim, chief inspector of prisons, said one shower
a week was the norm for inmates at Strangeways and the most
dangerous inmates were locked up 22 hours a day.
   ``They rarely left their cells save for slopping out, weekly
showers, collecting meals and one hour's exercise in a dirty
yard,'' Tumim said in a report last week. ``They could not use the
main library or gymnasium. Library books sent to them were limited
and in poor shape.''
   ``Slopping out'' is the morning emptying of chamber pots by
inmates, whose cells do not have flush toilets.
   The best-known riot in British penal history this century was at
Dartmoor, the grim jail built in 1809 on the moors of Devon. There,
a 1932 riot over poor food and conditions left 70 inmates and six
guards injured.

   Tropical summer storms battering
Bangladesh for the past nine days have killed 166 people and
injured at least 1,600, police and newspaper reports said Monday.
   A Bengali language daily, Ittefaq, said the latest deaths
occurred Sunday when 13 people were killed and at least 200 injured
in a storm that ripped through the coastal districts in the south
and the central province of Manikganj.
   At least five people were killed and 200 injured in house
collapses on the island of Urirchar off the southeastern coast, the
newspaper said. Another four people were killed in the coastal
district of Noakhali, and four others died in Manikganj, Ittefaq
said.
   At least 100 fishermen drowned Thursday in a sudden storm in the
Bay of Bengal, police officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The fishermen were listed as missing, but the officials,
contacted by telephone, said Monday there was no hope of finding
survivors.
   Thursday's storm also killed 15 people in the Noakhali district,
75 miles southeast of Dhaka. Many of the bodies were found buried
under collapsed huts. At least 500 people were injured.
   At least 38 people died in storms that struck the low-lying
nation earlier in the week.
   Summer floods, cyclones and storms kill hundreds of people every
year in Bangladesh.

   Dozens of angry people pounded on the doors
of the Prado Museum early Monday in a futile attempt to get into a
wildly popular exhibition of Diego Velazquez paintings, which just
ended its two-month run.
   More than 500,000 people flocked to the exhibition after it
opened Jan. 24, lining up several hours to see 80 paintings by the
17th-century Spanish master. It was billed as the most complete
Velazquez retrospective ever held.
   Museum officials said they were forced to reopen the exhibition
to latecomers twice Sunday night. This followed a public pledge by
the museum's director that the show would not close until the last
visitor had gone away.
   But about 40 people were turned away shortly after midnight,
despite banging on the door and chanting ``We want in!''
   The exhibition featured such works as ``Las Meninas,'' ``The
Forge of Vulcan,'' ``The Spinners,'' ``The Rokeby Venus,'' and
``The Portrait of Juan de Pareja.''

   Aldo Fabrizi, a character actor who gained
international fame for his role of a priest defying the Fascists in
``Open City,'' died Monday at 84, his family reported.
   Fabrizi was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago. ``He
basically died of old age,'' said his son, Massimo Fabrizi.
   The actor started out as a music hall comedian and began playing
character roles in films in the 1940s. He appeared in several dozen
movies, many of them comic roles with Fabrizi speaking in Roman
dialect.
   He was best known for his portrayal of the courageous Roman
Catholic priest, Don Pietro, in Roberto Rossellini's 1945
neo-realist classic ``Open City.''
   The corpulent actor also wrote several cook books and recited
his favorite recipes in verse, in the dialect of his native Rome.

   Police said Monday they seized more than
110 pounds of cocaine and arrested three people in one of Spain's
biggest drug hauls this year.
   Agents found the cocaine Thursday after searching the trunk of a
car in central Madrid, said police spokesman Manuel Gimenez. They
found two suitcases full of cocaine, he said.
   Police said they believed the cocaine had been smuggled from
Colombia.
   They arrested Maria Tamburu of Italy; her husband Alfredo Ramon
Vega de Dios, a Spanish citizen born in Argentina; and Francisco
Parra Tejon of Spain.
   So far this year, narcotics agents have seized 1,540 pounds of
cocaine in Spain, which authorities say is a major gateway to
Europe for Colombian cocaine traffickers.

   Although Paris boasts 100,000 seats in theaters both large and

   The cause of death was not released. Newspaper reports said
Jones had suffered a stroke while covering the rowing race on the

   He was taken to St George's Hospital in south London after the
race but did not regain consciousness, a hospital spokesman said.
   Jones was a featured correspondent on Sports Report, the BBC
sports roundup show. His recent work included commentary on the
Heysel Stadium riots in 1985, in which 35 people died, and the
disaster at Hillsborough Stadium last April, in which 95 soccer
fans were crushed to death.
   ``Only a loving heart and his experience could have brought to
us the horrors of Heysel and Hillsborough in two of the most awful

David Hatch, managing director of BBC network radio.
   Jone is survived by his wife and their two sons.

   Three city councilors resigned Monday to
protest the mayor's decision to receive the leader of the
extreme-right National Front at the city hall in Nice.
   The three, all members of the center-right coalition that
controls the council, said Mayor Jacques Medecin has been too
conciliatory with the National Front.
   In particular, the three objected to Medecin's decision to meet
with the National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, last Friday
before the anti-immigration party opened its three-day national
congress in Nice.
   Medecin said that by quitting, the councilors risked opening the
way for the National Front to win the vacated seats.
   The mayor is a member of the center-right Rally for the Republic
party. He noted that the National Front gained 20 percent of the
votes in a municipal election last year.

   Aldo Fabrizi, a character actor who gained
international fame for his role as a priest defying the fascists in
``Open City,'' died Monday, his family reported. He was 84.
   Fabrizi was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago. ``He
basically died of old age,'' said his son, Massimo Fabrizi.
   The actor started out as a music hall comedian and began playing
character roles in films in the 1940s. He appeared in several dozen
movies, many of them comic roles.
   He was best known for his portrayal of the courageous Roman
Catholic priest Don Pietro in Roberto Rossellini's 1945 neo-realist
classic ``Open City.''
   The actor also wrote several cook books.

   Dozens of people arrested in one of London's worst
riots were brought into court today, while government and
opposition leaders condemned the weekend violence that erupted
during a peaceful anti-tax rally.
   Home Secretary David Waddington, in charge of law enforcement,
told Parliament he was outraged over ``acts of criminal violence
and viciousness'' in Saturday's riot around central Trafalgar
Square that injured more than 400 people.
   On Sunday, a local property tax was replaced by a per-capita tax
that opponents say favors the rich.
   Waddington said a team of 100 officers will conduct a major
criminal investigation. He said there was ``plenty of evidence ...
in photographs and film to enable those responsible to be
identified.'' At least 341 people were arrested.
   Roy Hattersley, the opposition Labor Party's deputy leader,
condemned the rioting and said it was ``literally intolerable.''
   Police said 68 of 341 people arrested in clashes in Whitehall
and around Trafalgar Square were being brought to five magistrates'
courts today. The others were released pending trial.
   Police said the 68 were charged with public order offenses,
burglary, theft and assault. Some were released on bail today.
   Among those appearing in court today were three men and a woman
arrested Sunday when Waddington, touring Whitehall, was met with
protests. His car was damaged by protesters, who attacked him
shouting: ``No poll tax!''
   On Saturday, youths smashed windows, set cars ablaze and battled
police in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square for six hours after a
protest by 40,000 people against a new tax denounced by opponents
as favoring the rich.
   Authorities said 331 police and 86 civilians were hurt.
   The rioting left the heart of London looking like a war zone.
Clean-up crews cleared rubble and burned-out cars from the streets
and strollers wandered past boarded-up restaurants, pubs and shops
whose windows had been smashed.
   On Sunday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and opposition
politicians agreed that a small group of extremists were to blame
for turning what had been a peaceful protest against the new tax
violent.
   The demonstration organizers, the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax
Federation, blamed small groups of troublemakers without
specifically identifying them. They also accused police of losing
control.
   The tax, which took effect Sunday in England and Wales, replaces
a property tax with a levy on each adult. Critics say it is unfair
because Britain's richest man pays the same amount as his gardener.
   The new tax is part of Mrs. Thatcher's crusade to bury British
socialism by hitting at its last bastion _ local government. The
levy, which went into effect in Scotland a year ago, has been
greeted with frequent demonstrations, some violent.
   Critics have dubbed it the poll tax after a per-capita tax that
set off a peasants' revolt in 1381.

<HEAD>Congressmen Warn Broadcasters to Stop Glorifying Beer and Wine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress may ban broadcast advertising of beer
and wine if the broadcast industry doesn't stop glorifying alcohol
on its own, six congressmen warned at the industry's annual
convention.
   ``We're not after you all on this alcohol thing. We're just
putting you on notice,'' said Rep. Michael Synar, D-Okla., one of
six lawmakers who participated in a panel discussion at the
National Association of Broadcasters convention Sunday.
   The others were Reps. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio; Rodney D.
Chandler, R-Wash.; Jim Bates, D-Calif.; Joe L. Barton, R-Texas; and
Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.
   The lawmakers stressed that alcohol is a drug, and warned that
alcohol advertisements are not protected by the First Amendment.
   In addition, they said, some of the public service announcements
aimed at stopping drunken driving give the wrong message.
   ``The whole purpose of drinking is to get a buzz on so you don't
know when to say `when,''' said Luken. He was referring to Anheuser
Busch's ``Know When to Say When'' commercial.
   ``The implied message is that it's OK to get drunk out of your
damn mind, just don't drive,'' Chandler said, referring to a
commercial in which a would-be drunken driver is given a ride home.
   The congressmen said they didn't expect any laws regulating beer
and wine advertising to pass this session. But they urged the
broadcast and advertising industries to do their own policing.
   Congress banned broadcast advertising of cigarettes in 1970. The
beverage industry has voluntarily agreed for many years not to
advertise hard liquor on radio or television.

   A Chinese man who hijacked a jet to Japan to seek
political asylum has sent a letter to President Bush from prison,
his lawyer said Monday.
   The contents of the letter sent by Zhang Zhenhei were not
dislosed. Prosecutors told of its existence during a hearing in
Tokyo on whether Zhang should be extradited to China, said defense
attorney Kazuo Ito.
   Ito said Zhang confirmed he sent the letter, but prosecutors
said it did not reach Bush because it was sent to the wrong address.
   ``I don't know why he has sent such a letter,'' Ito said. ``But
he probably tried to appeal that he is working for the people and
that he is entitled to status as a political activist.''
   Zhang hijacked a Chinese jetliner carrying 233 people in
December. He was arrested after the plane landed in southwestern
Japan. He said he fled China to seek political asylum after taking
part in last spring's pro-democracy movement.
   The court must decide by April 22 whether to agree to China's
request for extradition.

   Mohawk Indians today offered to let state
police onto their land to investigate the shooting of a National
Guard helicopter. It was the first sign of a break in their
3-day-old standoff.
   State police negotiators were weighing the offer and considering
their response, officials said.
   A doctor on a medical mission was wounded in the shooting
Friday, and hundreds of state troopers with shotguns have blockaded
the traditionalist Indian community known as Ganienkeh since then.
   Armed Indians, some with AK-47 assault rifles, were spotted
inside the isolated woodland community of an estimated 40 families
about 150 miles north of Albany. The Indians have promised to
defend their land's sovereignty with their lives.
   The Mohawks offered to let an independent investigative team
onto the land if the investigators are escorted by Mohawks and
their findings are delivered immediately to both sides, Mohawk
spokesman Daryl Martin said Sunday.
   Martin said the proposal came after troopers granted an Indian
request to allow clan mothers from other Mohawk communities to pass
through the roadblocks for a meeting Sunday.
   ``A clan mother is a highly regarded individual in our society,
somebody who always has the interest of the land and her children
at heart,'' Martin said.
   ``This is a very serious matter and it's important that all of
the communities meet,'' Martin said. ``They may have fresh ideas on
how to solve this.''
   The Indians have insisted that a 1794 treaty gives them the
exclusive right to investigate crimes on their land. They said they
are willing to die over the issue.
   Busloads of people normally travel on weekends to the territory
to play high-stakes bingo, but the buses were turned back at the
roadblocks throughout the weekend.
   On Friday, gunfire forced down a low-flying Vermont National
Guard helicopter on a medical emergency flight. Dr. James Van Kirk,
27, was wounded but was not seriously hurt. He was discharged today
from Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, Vt., where he works.
   The National Guard flew the damaged helicopter off the Indian
land on Sunday. The Mohawks had let a crew on the territory to
repair the craft.
   State Police determined the shots were fired by a gunman
standing near a building on the territory, said Maj. Robert Leu.
   Martin insisted the shots did not come from the encampment.
   The crew chief of the helicopter, Sgt. Kris Samples, saw a man
fire a rifle at the chopper, Leu said. Another witness, a man who
had been driving a pickup truck and heard the shots, corroborated
Samples' account, Leu said.
   The settlement has its roots in a centuries-old claim by the
Mohawks, who say the land is among 9 million acres in New York and
Vermont wrongfully taken from them in the 18th century.
   In 1974, a man and a 9-year-old girl were shot and wounded while
riding in cars near a Mohawk encampment at Moss Lake, and the
Indians also refused to cooperate.
   Troopers maintained a vigil outside the encampment for nearly
three years, eventually building a guard house, but no arrests were
made, and negotiations ended with the Mohawks moving to the site of
Friday's incident.
   The state has sued the Indians to try to close a bingo hall that
opened in 1988.

<TEXT>
   The American Heart Association, under pressure
from the federal government, has decided to discontinue a food
labeling program designed to help consumers quickly identify
products considered best for the prevention of heart disease, a
spokesman said today.
   The HeartGuide program, an attempt by the heart association to
identify and label low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-sodium foods, came
under attack by the federal Food and Drug Administration, which
opposes endorsements by non-government groups.
   ``The FDA has made it clear it is against third-party
endorsements,'' Howard Lewis, director of health and science news
for the heart association, said Monday. ``The government's only
concern was that they did not like third party organizations
entering into an area where they had legal responsibility.''
   Lewis emphasized that only the labeling program will end.
Nutrition education and other aspects of the program will continue.
   The program was launched in January.
   HeartGuide was proposed in 1987 as an attempt to uniformly
identify foods with certain levels of cholesterol, fat and sodium.
   The foods were to be identified with a HeartGuide seal of
approval _ a heart with a checkmark _ on the package.
   Consumer groups, such as the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, expressed concern that consumers would be lulled by the
label into believing that HeartGuide-approved foods were actually
health foods. Those groups also complained about the fairness of
the ratings.
   The heart association planned to charge between $15,000 and
$600,000 a year to companies participating in the program. The fees
were to be used for a toll-free hotline and nutrition awareness
programs, the association said.
   Lewis said independent labs performed the food analyses after
companies submitted applications to have foods considered.
   He said the heart association was encouraged that the FDA plans
to overhaul the government's labeling program.
   ``The FDA has stated a commitment now to completely change the
way food labeling is done in the country and to challenge and get
rid of and set standards for such claims as low cholesterol, high
fiber, `lite,' things like that,'' Lewis said. ``We're very happy
that after 17 years, the government will move ahead _ 17 years
after promises to do something about food labeling.''

<HEAD>Jury Gets Poindexter Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New thruout with jury sent to deliberate</NOTE>

<HEAD></HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ssociated Press Writer&plus;WASHINGTON (AP) _ The jury in John M.
Poindexter's trial began deliberating today whether the former
national security adviser was guilty of withholding details of the
Iran-Contra affair from Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene instructed the jury of eight
women and four men to ignore the merits of President Reagan's
policies of helping the Nicaraguan rebels or selling arms to Iran
in an attempt to free American hostages.
   ``It's not for you to decide who was right in political disputes
between Congress and the president, between Democrats and
Republicans or between liberals and conservatives,'' Greene told
the jury.
   ``You are not called on to decide if the president's policy
toward Iran and the American hostages was a wise or unwise
policy,'' the judge said. He told them instead to focus on any
evidence of ``particular crimes ... as distinct from broad policy.''
   Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser from late
1985 to November 1986, is accused of conspiring with former White
House aide Oliver L. North and others to obstruct congressional
inquiries about covert assistance given the Contras and U.S.-Iran
arms sales.
   He also faces charges of obstructing Congress and making false
statements to lawmakers.
   In final arguments on Friday, defense lawyer Richard Beckler
told jurors that Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral, was not
part of ``some grimy little conspiracy that the prosecution would
have you believe.''
   He tried to suggest that North went behind Poindexter's back,
saying: ``There was absolutely many things that Admiral Poindexter
didn't know Oliver North was doing.''
   Beckler told jurors that Iran-Contra prosecutors produced as a
witness only one of Poindexter's alleged co-conspirators, Fawn
Hall, and that the former White House secretary testified she only
had a nodding acquaintance with the retired Navy rear admiral.
   But Greene told jurors it was not necessary for prosecutors to
prove that all the conspirators knew each other or that Poindexter
knew everything that other members of the alleged conspiracy were
doing.
   Prosecutors must show that ``the defendant knew or had reason to
know'' a conspiracy existed and actions were being taken to further
its goals, the judge said.
   According to testimony by North and Hall, who was his secretary,
the two destroyed numerous Iran-Contra documents as the diversion
of U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Contras was uncovered by
investigators.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb said Poindexter contributed to this
``rampage of destruction'' by deleting 5,000 electronic messages in
his office computer that contained a wealth of information about
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Investigators recovered the documents from a computer backup
system.
   Poindexter met with North after he discovered that Justice
Department investigators were coming over to the White House to
look for documents during the weekend of Nov. 21-23, 1986,
according to testimony.
   The prosecution contends that Ms. Hall, who was given immunity,
was part of the conspiracy because she helped North destroy or
remove secret documents.
   Other alleged co-conspirators who did not testify included
Poindexter's predecessor as national security advisor, Robert
McFarlane, and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord. Both
have pleaded guilty to Iran-Contra charges and are cooperating with
Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   Beckler chided the prosecution for pinning the blame on
Poindexter for the efforts of ``the missing Bud McFarlane'' to
mislead Congress in 1985 about covert efforts to assist the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding
information from Congress, while North was convicted last year of
aiding and abetting an obstruction of a congressional inquiry.
   Secord pleaded guilty to making a false statement to Congress.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley launched his
bid for a third term today and turned aside talk that he might be a
Democratic candidate for president in 1992.
   Speaking to a crowd of about 150 people at Montclair State
College, Bradley, 46, said he planned to serve the entire six-year
term in the Senate. ``I love my job because I can help people who
have no where else to turn,'' he said.
   Bradley called for improvements in education, including firing
poor teachers and bureaucrats. He also said he supported heavy
fines against ocean polluters, capital punishment for drug kingpins
and an elimination of subsidies for tobacco advertising.
   The former professional basketball player won convincingly in
his first two Senate campaigns, and now is deflecting speculation
about a possible presidential run in 1992.
   ``My answer is the same as it's always been, which is, look, I
want to be the best senator I can be for New Jersey,'' he said in
an interview last week. ``That's where I want to make my
contribution.''
   Possible Republican candidates include Christine Todd Whitman,
the former president of the state Board of Public Utilities, and
John Scott, chairman of the Conservative Caucus of New Jersey.

<HEAD>Soviet Immigrants: Fulfilling a Dream Amid Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GWEN ACKERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yosef Mendelevitch held up a piece of matzo
symbolizing Jewish freedom from slavery in ancient Egypt and
recited a blessing in Hebrew.
   About 100 new Soviet immigrants in the room watched, some with
bewildered looks. Then they too broke off and ate, for the first
time in their lives, a piece of Passover matzo.
   Mendelevitch was teaching the Passover traditions to the new
arrivals in Russian, telling them about the unleavened matzo. It
commemorates the haste with which the Israelites fled from the
pharaoh's army, with no time to wait for their bread to rise.
   ``They did not even recognize the story of Moses in the
bulrushes, a story even non-Jews know,'' said Mendelevitch, who
spent 11 years in a Soviet prison for trying to get to Israel.
   Passover begins this year at sundown April 9. The very presence
of the Soviet Jews is viewed by Israelis as a fulfillment of the
prayer at the end of the Passover story, to meet ``Next year in
Jerusalem.''
   But there is also an element of controversy, because the Soviet
Jews are living in Gilo, a Jerusalem suburb built on land captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   President Bush recently criticized the settling of Soviet
immigrants on war-won land, including east Jerusalem, saying it was
an obstacle to making peace with the Arabs.
   Leon Shansviteh, who arrived two months ago from Baku, in Soviet
Azerbaijan, said, ``We have the right to live in Gilo. I don't
understand President Bush. This area was empty until Jews built
here. Jerusalem is a Jewish city.''
   Reading from the Haggada, which recounts the Exodus from Egypt,
Mendelevitch said there are similarities between the flight from
the pharaoh's oppression and today's flight of tens of thousands of
Jews from the Soviet Union.
   ``In the Passover story, the Pharaoh kept saying the Jews could
leave, but whenever they tried he stopped them,'' Mendelevitch
said. ``Then God sent him 10 plagues to convince him to let the
Jewish people go.''
   ``The same thing happened with Soviet leaders in the Kremlin,''
Mendelevitch said. ``Finally, after world economic and medical
sanctions, they had no choice but to let us go.''
   Spurred by reports of anti-Semitism in the Soviet republics,
about 16,000 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel in the past year.
According to the American Jewish Committee, the rate has reached
more than 5,000 per month.
   Mendelevitch was convicted and jailed in 1970 for attempting to
hijack a plane and fly to Israel after being denied an exit permit.
He was freed and came to Israel in 1981.
   A group of religious women arranged for Mendelevitch to teach
the traditions of the Seder, or Passover dinner, in an attempt to
make entry into Jewish culture easier for the immigrants.
   White tableclothes, long candlesticks and all the traditional
dishes were on display: hard-boiled eggs, horseradish, lettuce,
parsley, wine, salt water, and ``choroset,'' a sweet pate of
apples, nuts and wine.
   Asa Luzman, who arrived a year ago from Kiev with her husband,
daughter and son-in-law, said: ``I never knew anything about the
holiday before I came to Israel. It's such a shame.''
   A few, like the Shansviteh family, only two months in Israel,
were at home with the ceremonies even if they didn't join in the
recitation of Hebrew prayers.
   Shansviteh's grandfather, an observant Jew, had led his family's
Passover Seder from memory every year in Baku.
   ``In the Soviet Union, it is very dangerous to hold a Seder,''
Shansviteh said in halting Hebrew.
   An Israel radio call-in show matched 18,000 newcomers with
Israeli hosts for the Passover holiday.
   ``Many Israelis celebrating the Seder will speak of another
miracle taking place,'' said Gad Ben Ari, spokesman for the
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which raises funds and helps
settle immigrants.
   ``In the Passover story, the sea opened up to let the Israelites
cross and flee their oppressors. Two years ago, the chance that the
Soviet government would let the Jews out was just as unlikely.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Decide if Soaring Damage Awards Constitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether skyrocketing punitive-damage awards in personal-injury and
other cases can go so high they become unconstitutional.
   In a case of enormous importance to American business and
consumers, the court agreed to hear arguments in an Alabama
insurance-fraud case that yielded a jury award of over $1 million.
   The court must decide whether punitive damages aimed at
punishing wrongdoers and deterring similar misconduct may be so
large in some cases that they are fundamentally unfair. A ruling is
expected sometime in 1991.
   In other action, the court:
   _Refused to expose car manufacturers to product-liability
lawsuits for not installing air bags. Suits against General Motors,
Honda and Nissan Motor Corp. were thrown out by lower courts and
the justices declined to review them.
   _Left intact a ruling that airlines say could impede mergers.
The justices, in a case stemming from Delta Air Lines' acquisition
of Western Airlines in 1986, refused to shield Delta from binding
arbitration in a dispute with the union that had represented
Western's flight attendants.
   _Turned down an appeal by a Massachusetts church that said its
religious freedom will be violated if state approval is required
for the curriculum of a school it runs.
   The court last year ruled that huge awards in civil lawsuits,
often millions of dollars, do not violate the Constitution's ban on
excessive fines. But the justices left open the possibility that
such awards may be so disproportionate to the actual harm suffered
that they violate due-process rights.
   The Constitution says states may not deprive anyone of property
without due process of law. Those seeking to limit awards say due
process prohibits unlimited discretion by judges and juries.
   Business leaders for years have clashed with lawyers and
consumer groups over the legitimacy of huge judgments in civil
cases.
   Those who oppose the big-money awards say they squelch American
competitiveness and development of new products, particularly new
forms of medical treatment, by discouraging risk-taking.
   They say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy to help those
who have suffered serious injuries, particularly if the wrongdoer
is a giant corporation.
   On the other side, consumer activists and trial lawyers say
punitive damages are a powerful deterrent to corporate greed that
can threaten public safety and well-being. They say smaller
compensatory awards may be viewed by larger corporations as an
acceptable cost of doing business.
   Recent studies show the size of punitive damages has climbed
dramatically in recent years.
   Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates,
have put caps on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury
cases. Those laws are not at issue directly in the case acted on
Monday.
   The justices will hear an appeal by Pacific Mutual Life
Insurance Co., found by a jury to have been responsible for fraud
by one of its agents, Lemmie Ruffin. The company denied it had
sanctioned Ruffin's conduct.
   Lower court records said employees of Roosevelt City, Ala., paid
health insurance premiums to Ruffin, which he pocketed.
   Cleopatra Haslip, a city worker who had been paying premiums,
learned her insurance had lapsed after she incurred $2,500 in
hospital and medical bills in 1982.
   The hospital demanded $600 before agreeing to discharge her, and
her doctor eventually turned her case over to a collection agency.
Her credit also suffered from her inability to pay the bills.
   Mrs. Haslip and other members of the insurance plan sued Pacific
Mutual and Ruffin. A jury in 1987 awarded her $1,040,000. Three
other Roosevelt City employees were awarded a total of $38,000.
   It is not clear from records filed with the Supreme Court how
much of the money was intended to compensate the workers for actual
losses and how much was designed to punish the insurance company.
   The Alabama Supreme Court upheld the awards last year, saying,
``Jury verdicts are presumed correct, and that presumption is
strengthened when the presiding judge refuses to grant a new
trial.''
   Pacific Mutual said its constitutional rights were violated
because the jury was allowed to award damages ``as a matter of
moral discretion without adequate standards as to the amount
necessary to punish and deter.''
   The company also contended it is the victim of unfair
discrimination because Alabama law imposes a cap on punitive
damages in some cases.

   Defense lawyers delayed jury selection this
morning in the case of a black teen-ager slain by a mob of whites.
   The lawyers questioned an assistant Brooklyn district attorney
and a police detective about lineups involving the suspects accused
in the slaying.
   Prosecutors had said they were ready to open the trials of
alleged triggerman Joseph Fama and Keith Mondello, accused of being
the ringleader of the young men charged in the Aug. 23 slaying of
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   Hawkins was shot after he went with three friends into the
largely Italian Bensonhurst neighborhood in Brooklyn to look at a
used car.
   Fama and Mondello are charged with murder and face 25 years to
life in prison if convicted. Five others have been charged with
murder and a sixth with assault. They will stand trial later in
groups.
   Last week, Assistant District Attorney Bruce McIntyre, who had
been slated to present opening arguments, suddenly quit, saying he
resented being a ``token'' black at the prosecution table.
   Prosecutors suffered a major blow earlier in the month when a
key witness and alleged participant in the attack reneged on a deal
to cooperate. John Vento, 21, decided to face murder charges rather
than testify against his friends.
   Vento's unexpected defection had forced a one-month delay in the
start of the trials.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes says he's
``baffled'' by McIntyre's resignation and regrets Vento's change of
heart but insists he's confident he has a case he can win.
   Judge Thaddeus Owens ruled that Fama, 19, and Mondello, 20,
would be the first to stand trial. The judge planned to speed the
proceedings by impaneling two juries that would sit side by side,
one deciding Fama's fate and the other Mondello's.
   The slaying caused a furor across the city. It was seen as the
most serious racial incident in the city since a 1986 attack in
which a black man, chased by a gang of whites in the Howard Beach
neighborhood, ran onto a highway and was killed by a car.
   The Bensonhurst slaying was apparently ignited by a dispute
between Mondello and a former girlfriend, Gina Feliciano. As word
raced through the neighborhood that Miss Feliciano had invited
black and Hispanic friends to her 18th birthday party, Mondello
allegedly recruited some friends to take on what they saw as
intruders on their turf.
   A gang of some 30 whites, many armed with baseball bats, mistook
Hawkins and his three teen-age pals, all black, as the expected
outsiders and set upon them.
   As the gang surrounded the blacks, Fama allegedly stepped in
with his gun and fired four shots, three of which struck Hawkins
and killed him.

   A man accused of fatally poisoning his son
in a scheme to collect damages from an infant formula maker goes on
trial later this month in a case that languished until a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling cleared the way.
   Ricky Irby, 28, is charged with murdering his son Quinten in
1986.
   Irby says he was away when the poisoning occurred and contends
the baby's mother, Sheila Smith, fed him sulfuric acid-laced
formula.
   Smith, 27, whose murder trial begins in May, says she had
nothing to do with her son's death and has indicated the Irby may
have been involved.
   The case might never have come to trial because of the
disappearance of an opened can of formula and a bottle tainted with
acid. But the high court in 1988 ruled that evidence lost by
accident does not preclude prosecution.
   Jury selection in Irby's case was scheduled to begin today, but
was delayed until April 30 at the prosecution's request. Assistant
Lake County State's Attorney Matthew Chancey said he needed extra
time to get information about additional witnesses defense
attorneys plan to call to the stand. He said he learned of the
witnesses over the weekend.
   The parents are being tried separately because of their
antagonistic defenses. Prosecutors said they will seek the death
penalty.
   Smith and Irby are being held on $1 million bail each.
   Three-month-old Quinten Irby was poisoned in 1984 and lingered
in a hospital for more than two years before dying at 2{.
   He suffered severe burns that scarred his mouth and trachea, had
one lung removed and remained on a respirator _ apparently comatose
_ until his death.
   Prosecutors allege the parents forced the boy to drink sulfuric
acid in a murder-for-profit scheme in which a product-liability
lawsuit was filed against the maker of Quinten's baby formula. Irby
filed the lawsuit in 1987 against Abbott Laboratories _ which
denied the allegations _ but withdrew it a year later.
   Smith, 27, was not a party to the lawsuit, said her lawyer,
Laureen Cahill Casey.
   The bottle and can of formula were tested by toxicologist Joerg
Pirl at a state crime laboratory but disappeared with Pirl's file
in 1984.
   Pirl underwent hypnosis in an effort to find the evidence, but
the hypnotist later died, and Pirl could not recall what he had
told the man, Ms. Casey said.
   Investigators later determined the evidence had been destroyed
accidentally by a lab clerical worker, and with no evidence the
case essentially was closed. But after the Supreme Court ruling,
Smith and Irby were indicted in 1989.

<HEAD>Earthquake Shakes Large Swathe of England and Wales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An earthquake shook a broad swathe of England and
Wales today, emptying buildings and sending hundreds of frightened
people into the streets. There were no immediate reports of
injuries or serious damage.
   The quake, believed to be centered west of Nottingham in central
England, was felt from the outskirts of London to south Wales, and
north through Birmingham, Coventry and Manchester to the Scottish
border, police stations around the country reported.
   The British Geological Survey in Edinburgh said it registered
5.2 on the Richter scale of ground motion. The Armenian earthquake
in December 1988, which killed 25,000 people, measured 6.9.
   Leeds University scientists reported a reading of 4.
   Police switchboards were besieged by frightened callers
following the temblor, which struck between 2:45 p.m. and 2:50 p.m.
   Buildings shook, there were reports of cracks in walls, and
ornaments fell off shelves.
   Margaret Hyde, press officer of the Greater Manchester Ambulance
Service, said her office building in the city center was evacuated.
   ``I felt the floor was moving underneath me. It was like
standing on a platform in a station and feeling a heavy train go
past,'' she said.
   Betty Hill, from a village near Rugby in central England, said:
``I was sitting on a chair in the kitchen and saw the walls shake
around me. The chair itself shook, bottles moved toward the edge of
shelves, everything rattled and a kitchen draw slid open.
   ``Then about three seconds after the first tremor finished, just
when I thought it was all over I felt another tremor. The whole
thing was very frightening.''
   Two Shrewsbury streets were closed, one because of a gas leak
and the other because of falling masonry, authorities said.
   ``I was really shocked. Things started to tumble off the shelves
and smash. The furniture started to move and I thought the house
was about to collapse,'' said Barbara Jordan of Shrewsbury. ``Lots
of women with their babies ran into the street to see what was
going on.''
   BBC studios in Cardiff, Wales, were evacuated, and there were
reports of elevators stopping in high-rise buildings as the tremor
activated their automatic brakes.
   Two trials were suspended as the Crown Court was evacuated in
Mold, Wales.
   In the past 10 years, England and Wales have been hit by more
than 60 earthquakes which have registered more than 2.5 on the
Richter scale, strong enough to be felt by people.
   The strongest, which registered 5.4, shook North Wales in July
1984.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 5.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 4.5.

   Police opened fire Monday on protesters
demanding legalization of political parties in Nepal, killing at
least five people and injuring 17, hospital sources and witnesses
said.
   Witnesses said officers charged and hurled tear gas, then began
shooting after a crowd of about 4,000 refused to disperse. They
said the shooting occurred near Tribhuvan University in Katmandu's
southeastern outskirts.
   The crowd had marched from neighboring Kirtipur and was
proceeding toward Katmandu, the capital of this Himalayan kingdom,
the witnesses said.
   Under standing regulations, city police do not give information
to reporters. Officials were not immediately available for comment.
   ``It was a peaceful demonstration and people were going to
Katmandu to tell the world how authorities are harassing us,'' said
one man who took part in the procession. He refused to give his
name.
   He said the demonstration was spontaneous and not called by
either the Nepali Congress Party or a left-wing coalition. The two
groups are leading the movement for restoration of a multiparty
system in Nepal.
   Police also fired on demonstrators in downtown Katmandu and in a
residential neighborhood in the capital's northeast, other
witnesses said, also speaking on condition they not be identified.
   According to casualty figures from two city hospitals, five
people were killed and 17 injured in the three incidents. It was
not immediately clear where the deaths occurred, but earlier
reports said three people died in the university incident.
   The government says at least 15 people have died since Sunday in
clashes inspired by the democracy movement, which started with a
public rally Feb. 18. Activists say the number of victims is double
that.
   The government rejects the demand for a multiparty democracy,
saying its proponents are trying to foist their system on a nation
that already has a working democracy.
   Nepal attempted a Western-style democracy in 1959 when the
Nepali Congress Party was overwhelmingly voted to power and formed
the country's first parliamentary government.
   The experiment ended when King Mahendra, the present monarch
Birendra's father, dismissed the government in 1961. He accused it
of corruption and banned political parties.

<HEAD>Christian Forces Renew Fighting After Short Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled Monday
with artillery and rockets in Beirut and the snow-swept mountains
northeast of the city in their fight for dominance of Lebanon's
Christian enclave.
   The fighting broke out around midnight, shattering a cease-fire
brokered by Vatican-backed mediators only a few hours earlier.
   Snow blocked mountain roads and prevented Gen. Michel Aoun's
army troops and Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia from
launching ground offensives.
   At least a dozen fires blazed in the Christian enclave. In
Beirut, several fuel storage tanks burned out of control. Fires
spread near stocks at a large liquor factory which manufactures
arak, Lebanon's licorice-flavored national drink.
   Police said one person was wounded by sniper fire in east
Beirut's Christian district of Nabaa.
   The battle for the 310-square-mile Christian enclave has left
839 people dead and 2,290 wounded since it began Jan. 30, police
said.
   Thick smoke formed mushroom clouds over the snow-covered
mountains of Kesrouan province east of Beirut as the two sides
traded fire with rockets, howitzers and tanks.
   ``The cold weather, snows and thick fog have prevented the
warring factions from launching any ground attacks,'' said a police
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Visibility is
almost nil in the Kesrouan mountains,'' he said.
   Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir continued talks with
neutral Christian leaders on ways of halting the confrontation.
   Aoun and Geagea are members of the Maronite sect, which has
dominated Lebanese politics since the nation's independence from
France in 1943.
   Parliamentary Deputy Pierre Helou, talking to reporters after
meeting with Sfeir, urged the government of Syrian-backed President
Elias Hrawi to ``spread state authority throughout Lebanon.''
   As Helou left the two-story hilltop stone monastery that houses
Sfeir's seat, the thuds of exploding shells could be heard in the
background.
   The Christian enclave was home to about one million people
before the power struggle between Aoun and Geagea broke out.
   Police said at least 250,000 people have fled the enclave to
safer areas in the predominantly Moslem sectors of Lebanon, or to
neighboring Syria or Cyprus.
   A Christian security source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he saw no solution to the fighting.
   ``No one is willing to settle for anything less than a total
victory, which cannot be achieved,'' he said.
   The prestigious an-Nahar newspaper said Geagea, in an effort to
form an alliance against Aoun, offered to hand over the east Beirut
district of Ashrafiyeh to Hrawi's government. It did not disclose
further details.
   The report came two days after Geagea's fighters opened a
crossing gateway linking Beirut's Moslem sector with Ashrafiyeh.
   Unlike Geagea, Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi's authority. He
opposes a peace accord that led to Hrawi's election in November,
because it did not include a timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian
troops from Lebanon.
   Also Monday, a fighter of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia was killed and two others were wounded when a roadside bomb
exploded near their armored personnel carrier in south Lebanon.
   A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attack was reported near the village of Beit Yahoun, within
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone.''
   Israel created the 6-to-10-mile wide strip in 1985 when it
withdrew the bulk of its invading army from Lebanon.
   The zone is patrolled by the South Lebanon Army militia and
Israeli troops and was designed to halt cross-border guerrilla
attacks on northern Israel.

   Up to 11,000 Kaiser Permanente employees
went on strike today at seven hospitals and more than 40 medical
offices in Southern California after weekend talks failed to
produce a contract.
   ``We have launched our strike and we are picketing at this
moment at all of the facilities,'' said Doris Boyd Snyder, first
vice president of the Service Employees International Union Local
399. ``We'll hold off until we get a better offer.''
   The union earlier rejected a three-year offer from
Pasadena-based Kaiser Permanente, the nation's oldest and largest
health maintenance organization. Kaiser has more than 2 million
subscribers in Southern California.
   The union includes licensed vocational nurses, clerks,
housekeepers and radiology technicians at seven of the Kaiser
Permanente Medical Centers and more than 40 satellite medical
offices in Los Angeles and Orange counties.
   At Kaiser's Anaheim hospital, more than 100 workers quietly
walked the picket lines this morning, carrying black-and-white ``On
Strike'' signs.
   ``Most of us here have ourselves and families to support. It's
hard on both sides,'' said Joyce Johnston, a licensed vocational
nurse.
   Kaiser will borrow workers from facilities unaffected by the
strike, said Janice Seib, a spokeswoman for the HMO. She said many
patients had already been transferred out of Kaiser hospitals and
non-emergency surgery had been postponed.
   A six-hour negotiating session with a federal mediator ended
Saturday without an agreement, Seib said.
   On Friday, some 5,000 workers rejected a contract offer by more
than 2-to-1, said Tom Ramsay, a union spokesman.
   The company had offered a 5 percent to 6 percent raise in the
first year and a 3 percent to 5 percent raise during the second and
third year.
   The union has not said how big a raise it wants.
   Kaiser employees accepted a wage freeze three years ago and have
stood by the company during nine years of financial difficulty,
Ramsay said.
   ``Now that Kaiser is back on their feet and prospering,
employees expected some recognition and didn't get that, and they
were very angry,'' he said.
   The hospitals affected are in Los Angeles, West Los Angeles,
Panorama City, Woodland Hills, Harbor City, Bellflower and Anaheim.

<HEAD>Study Finds Almost 1 in 6 of Childbearing-Age Women Sterilized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one in every six American women in the
normal childbearing age group has been surgically sterilized as a
method of birth control, a government report shows.
   The results of the National Center for Health Statistics study
indicate that nearly as many women 15 to 44 opt for sterilization
as choose to use the birth control pill. Figures on abortion were
not included.
   The study, which provides the most recent contraceptive data
available, found that 16.6 percent of those women interviewed had
been sterilized, while 18.5 percent used the pill.
   In 1982, about 13 percent of women in that age range had been
surgically sterilized.
   The number of men who chose to be sterilized rose only slightly
_ from 6.1 percent in 1982 to 7 percent in 1988.
   The center's Dr. William D. Mosher said Monday that the increase
in sterilization largely involves women 30 and older who want no
more children.
   ``We know from other research ... that by age 30 or so that
about three-quarters of women who have been married have had all
the births they want,'' Mosher said in a telephone interview.
   ``They have 10 to 15 years left when it is physically possible
to conceive, but they don't want to. That's a long time at risk of
pregnancy but wanting no more births.''
   However, Mosher said the continuing increase in sterilization
``keeps surprising me.''
   The highest rate of surgical sterilization, 32.5 percent, was
among women 35 to 44, the report said. By comparison, just 1.6
percent of those 15 to 24 had undergone sterilization. The rate is
16.6 percent in the 26 to 34 age group.
   Most of those women have used the pill in the past and want a
form of contraception that is as effective, he said. That limits
them to resuming use of the birth control pill or sterilization for
themselves or their partner.
   Use of the pill is discouraged for women who smoke, are over 35
or have health problems.
   ``Female sterilization is getting easier and safer ... so for a
lot of couples it probably seems the only sensible choice,'' Mosher
said.
   Nearly one-fourth of all currently married women, 23.4 percent,
had been sterilized surgically, the study found. That was an
increase from 18.7 percent in 1982.
   Among widowed, divorced and separated women the rate was even
higher, 29.2 percent in 1988, up from 21.8 percent six years
earlier. Only 2.7 percent of single women had been sterilized, but
that was up from 1.3 percent in 1982.
   More single women, the study found, are requiring their partners
to use condoms. Condom use has been stressed in recent years as a
method to avoid sexually transmitted disease.
   Use of condoms by never-married women doubled from 4.1 percent
in 1982 to 8.2 percent in 1988; for married women it rose from 9.4
percent to 10.6 percent in the same period.
   ``I think the other thing that surprised me was that there
wasn't more condom use among never-married women,'' Mosher said.
   Birth control pills remained the leading method used by single
women, 24.7 percent in 1988 compared with 18.7 percent in 1982.
Female sterilization was the most common method of birth control
for widows and formerly married women, Mosher said.
   The study's figures on sterilization were for women who chose
sterilization as a method of birth control. In addition, 4.7
percent of women in the 15 to 44 age group were sterile as a result
of surgery performed for other reasons.
   The report by the center, a division of the Department of Health
and Human Services, was based on 1988 interviews with 8,450 women
across the country. The margin of error varies, but all results
were considered statistically reliable at a 95 percent confidence
level.
   Here is a rundown of the major methods of contraception and the
percentage of women 15 to 44 using them in 1988 and 1982. The total
does not add to 100 because many women do not use contraception.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday it's
getting very serious about energy conservation and environmental
issues it suggested were given short shrift under President Reagan.
   Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins made the assessment as he
released an interim report on an energy strategy his department
plans to submit to President Bush in December.
   The 230-page report summarized views expressed in 12,000 pages
of testimony taken at 15 public hearings that began in August.
   ``The hardest choices lie ahead,'' Watkins said. ``If we can
finish a product that will make everybody equally unhappy, we will
have done our job.''
   The report draws no conclusions, but presents an array of
possibilities and lists potential obstacles, including objections
of industry groups.
   ``The loudest single message was to increase energy efficiency
in every sector of energy use,'' Watkins said. ``Energy efficiency
was seen as a way to reduce pollution, reduce dependence on oil
imports and reduce the cost of energy.''
   In response to a question, Watkins said environmental concerns
would be a significant factor in shaping the final report.
   `I don't think the department has been that forthcoming in those
areas in the past and we are getting very serious about it at the
direction of the president,'' he said.
   The report calls for examination of strict conservation
requirements and government-financed development of renewable
alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric dams and
geothermal power.
   Reagan stoutly opposed such measures, arguing that energy issues
should be left to the marketplace. He even advocated doing away
with the Energy Department.
   Bush, in asking for the energy strategy said, ``A keystone of
this strategy is going to be the continuation of the successful
policy of market reliance.''
   The report nevertheless lists scores of ideas calling for a more
active government role, including industry regulation.
   Among them:
   _New or heightened government efforts to find new energy
sources, including solar, nuclear fusion, safer and cheaper nuclear
fission, and alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas,
methanol and ethanol for automobiles.
   _More demanding government fuel efficiency standards for
automobiles, requiring the manufacture of more compact vehicles.
   _Higher efficiency standards for appliances and other electrical
devices, including home and office lights.
   _A return to energy-oriented tax breaks, ranging from special
allowances for domestic oil explorers to new incentives for
homeowners to install better insulation and solar heating systems.
   The interim report said reliance on foreign oil continues to
soar despite remarkable strides in efficency since the oil crises
of the 1970s.
   Watkins said the best estimate is that U.S. energy efficiency
could be increased by 10 percent to 12 percent by early in the next
century if present policies are followed. He said the department
believes that can be doubled by following some of the steps
outlined in the report.

   Nelson Mandela toured a
violence-wracked black township in Natal province today and
appealed for an end to factional battles that have kept blacks from
uniting to fight white minority rule.
   President F.W. de Klerk today announced heavier security in the
southeastern province, including more troops, searches, roadblocks
and possibly more detentions.
   Officials say fighting in Natal between supporters of Mandela's
African National Congress and Inkatha, a Zulu organization, left at
least 53 people dead and hundreds injured since last Tuesday.
   ``We are not fighting Inkatha. We are fighting apartheid and the
forces of oppression,'' Mandela told 2,000 people crammed into a
church hall in Edendale. At least 13,000 people fled their homes
around Edendale after rival factions burned hundreds of houses,
police said. Refugees were sheltered at churches, schools and
community centers.
   Police Maj. Piet Kitching said the situation was ``very tense''
and serious fighting could erupt at any time. Rival factions
battled Sunday with automatic weapons and police patrols were
ambushed, officials said.
   Mandela, ANC deputy president, also said today he will meet
President F.W. de Klerk on Thursday to discuss ways to end the
violence.
   Mandela, who has acknowledged differences with other ANC
leaders, decided to meet de Klerk despite the ANC decision to pull
out of talks April 11.
   The ANC canceled the meeting because police shot and killed at
least nine demonstrators last week in the black township of
Sebokeng near Johannesburg. The organization said it would
reconsider entering talks once the government curbs the police.
   De Klerk, addressing Parliament in Cape Town today, also said he
and Mandela will meet this week. He criticized the ANC for pulling
out of the April 11 meeting and for its continued commitment to a
guerrilla campaign.
   ``It is difficult to understand why an organization saying it is
interested in peace, refuses to come and talk about that very
issue,'' de Klerk said.
   De Klerk said security forces will play a more visible role,
setting up roadblocks and patrolling troubled areas by road and
helicopter. He said security forces will play a more visible role,
setting up roadblocks and patrolling troubled areas by road and
helicopter.
   ``Everyone must understand that these decisions could lead to a
rise in the number of people being detained,'' de Klerk said.
   More than 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths
of time under a state of emergency in effect since June 1986.
However, no more than a few dozen people presently are in detention.
   In his address, de Klerk also said the government will propose
legislation that would free more prisoners convicted of politically
motivated acts.
   No details were released, but such legislation would presumably
free hundreds of imprisoned activists and allow exiled members of
Mandela's African National Congress to return without fear of
prosecution.
   Rival Zulu tribe factions of the ANC-allied United Democratic
Front and the conservative Inkatha movement have been fighting for
control of rural areas of Natal. Hundreds of people have been
killed in the fighting.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi met today with church
leaders including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and said they
were biased in favor of the ANC and its ally, the United Democratic
Front.
   ``Quite honestly you are wasting your time here,'' Buthelezi
told the church leaders. ``Go to those peole who have ...
re-committed the ANC to intensifying the armed struggle.''
   Buthelezi accused the ANC of ``cowardice'' for backing out of
talks with the government and re-affirmed his readiness to
negotiate.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other black opposition groups in
February to try and the clear the way for ending apartheid and
building a new political structure.

   The Chokecherry Jam-boree Pit Spitting
Contest is months away, but the defending champions are already
boasting.
   ``We challenge everyone who thinks they have enough pucker-power
to beat us to try,'' said Janie Weverka, women's division champ
from last year's first annual contest. ``But everyone who tries had
better be prepared because we're tough.''
   ``My mother told me that young ladies don't spit,'' Weverka
said. ``But she is on the sidelines encouraging me now. If I would
have listened to her, I'd never ended up as a world champion!''
   This year's contest is planned for the Custer County community's
Chokecherry Jam-boree July 21-22.
   ``We're proud of our title,'' said Jerry Davenport, men's
division champion. ``It takes a certain amount of finesse and lots
of determination to get that tiny chokecherry pit airborne.''
   ``Anybody can get a cherry pit to travel several feet, but it
takes special know-how to get any distance with a chokecherry
pit,'' he said.
   Davenport took the title last year with a spit of 33 feet, 5
inches. His closest competitor hit 31 feet.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see it bettered this year because
last year we were spitting into the wind,'' Davenport said.

   A Pennsylvania amusement park is going to
great lengths _ and heights _ to prove it has the tallest wooden
roller coaster in the country. And it matters whether you measure
up or down.
   Dorney Park has filed suit in federal court to stop Six Flags
Over Texas from claiming that honor.
   ``They wouldn't do it voluntarily,'' Dorney Park attorney
Richard Stevens said Monday.
   Six Flags advertisements claim the Texas Giant coaster is
highest, 143 feet compared with 95 feet for Dorney's Hercules
coaster.
   But Dorney Park insists Hercules is 157 feet, and the Texas
Giant 137 feet.
   ``I can't believe these guys,'' said Bob Bennett, president and
general manager of Six Flags. ``It's ridiculous. If you talk to
anybody in this business they measure a ride from the ground to the
top of the lift.''
   Wrong, Stevens said. You measure the length of the drop after
you get to the top.
   ``It doesn't make any difference how long it takes to go up, it
matters how long it is coming down,'' Stevens said. ``We built our
roller coaster over a cliff.''
   The $6 million Hercules opened in May 1989. The $5.5 million
Texas Giant opened last month in Arlington.
   Stevens said he's not surprised at the Texans' claim: ``After
all, they used to think they were the biggest state, too.''

<TEXT>
   The owners of a retirement home for aging
political activists overwhelmingly rejected selling the building to
a developer who had offered $1.2 million.
   Members of the non-profit corporation that runs Sunset Hall
voted 139-7 on Sunday against the sale, the latest move to preserve
home. Residents say it's one of the only places where elderly
freethinkers can intellectually thrive.
   The home's directors last fall had agreed to close the 36-bed
Sunset Hall and relocate the residents. The directors had said the
home was losing money and financial reserves were nearly exhausted.
   A group of residents and other members of the non-profit
corporation won a court battle March 6 when a judge issued a
temporary order barring the sale.
   The 10 directors and administrator resigned and were replaced by
opponents of the sale.
   The developer, meanwhile, is suing the organization, contending
it reneged on the deal.

<HEAD>Hashemi's Lebanon Visit not Hostage-Related, Shiite Leader Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem leader denied Monday that
a recent visit by the brother of Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani was related to the 18 Western hostages held by
underground Shiite factions.
   Mahmoud Hashemi's visit late last month to Lebanon was for
``humanitarian purposes and not linked to the hostages,'' said a
statement by Hussein Mousawi, one of the Shiite Lebanese leaders
who met Rafsanjani's brother.
   The conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar, based in Christian east
Beirut, had reported that Hashemi met in the eastern Bekaa Valley
last week with Mousawi and leaders of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
   Hezbollah is an umbrella for Shiite groups holding the Western
hostages.
   Rafsanjani has in the past assigned his brother to sensitive
missions. Ad-Diyar suggested that his visit to the Syrian-policed
Bekaa Valley was related to the issue of the Western hostages.
   The statement by Mousawi, who heads the Islamic Amal, or Islamic
Hope movement, described Ad-Diyar's report as ``fantasy.'' Islamic
Amal is closely associated with Hezbollah but is not known to hold
hostages.
   The Iranian Embassy has withheld comment on Hashemi's visit to
Lebanon, the latest in a series since President Rafsanjani took
office Aug. 3.
   Rafsanjani heads a pragmatic faction in Iran which seeks better
relations with the West. He has said the foreign captives held by
pro-Iranian radical Shiite factions should be released.
   Rafsanjani is opposed by anti-Western Iranian hard-liners headed
by Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   A statement by 170 members of Iran's 270-seat Parliament last
week said the Iranian Foreign Ministry should distance itself from
efforts to free the hostages.
   The parliamentarians said the hostages' fate should be decided
by the ``people of Lebanon'' who want release of Palestinians and
Lebanese held by Israel and Western countries.
   The Western hostages, held mainly by Hezbollah-affiliated
factions, include eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans,
two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985. Most of the other hostages have been held at least three
years.

   A state judge says convicted murderer Jean
Harris may keep the $35,000 she earned from a magazine excerpt of
her book because it deals with her life in prison, not her crime.
   The judge ruled that the state Crime Victims Board erred in
applying the state's ``Son of Sam Law.''
   The law, named after a 1970s serial killer, was aimed at
preventing criminals from profiting from their crimes by writing
books, television or film scripts. It requires the criminal to turn
over to the victims board any proceeds earned.
   Ms. Harris, a former headmistress at the Madeira School, was
convicted in 1981 of killing diet doctor Herman Tarnower, her lover
for 10 years. She is serving 15 years to life at a prison in
Bedford Hills.
   She contracted with Macmillan Inc. in 1985 to write an
autobiography, ``Stranger in Two Worlds.'' Good Housekeeping
magazine paid $35,000 for exclusive serial rights in 1986.
   In a decision issued Friday, Justice Leonard N. Cohen noted that
the 5,000-word excerpt contained only one paragraph that mentioned
her crime.
   ``The core of the article is solely about her life and
experiences in prison after her conviction,'' he said.
   The judge ordered the board to turn the $35,000 over to Harris.
She intends to donate it to a non-profit organization run by her
son for the children of women in the Bedford Hills prison.

   The Duchess of York's sister, Jane Makim, accepted
substantial undisclosed damages and a public apology from the Daily
Mirror newspaper over stories suggesting she had an adulterous
affair.
   The allegations appeared in three stories published in October
1988. Two were on the front page.
   The tabloid also ran a story that alleged Mrs. Makim tried to
trick her husband, Alexander Makim, into signing visa papers so she
could take their two children to England. The Makims are separated
and live in Australia.
   Mrs. Makim's lawyer, Andrew Caldecott, announced the settlement
of the libel action Monday, telling High Court Judge Michael Davies
that Mrs. Makim had not been unfaithful to her husband. He also
said she never plotted to deceive her husband into releasing the
children to her.
   The articles caused Mrs. Makim considerable distress and
embarrassment, Caldecott said. The newspaper published an apology
that withdrew the allegations. It also said it will pay Mrs.
Makim's legal costs.
   The Duchess of York, who is married to Queen Elizabeth II's son,
Prince Andrew, left the hospital Friday after the birth of their

   Mayor David Dinkins has occasionally thrown his
hat into the ring, but that doesn't mean he wants to set foot

   The mayor was promoting Wednesday night's bout at Madison Square

Garden's main arena in four years.
   The fighters presented Dinkins with a referee's shirt and bow

   President Bush today appealed to broadcasters to
``stand for freedom'' and support efforts to beam television
broadcasts into Cuba, even though they could suffer retaliation.
   Bush, in a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters
convention, signalled his strong support for the fledgling
broadcast efforts of TV Marti, which Castro began jamming as soon
as it first went on the air March 27.
   Castro has threatened to retaliate by interfering with American
broadcast signals of stations in Florida.
   ``I do understand the concerns some of you have about this. But
I also understand that you represent the very principle TV Marti
exists to serve: the free flow of ideas,'' said the president.
   ``I ask you to stand by your traditions, the best traditions of
America. I ask you, once again, to stand for TV Marti, to stand for
freedom,'' said Bush.
   By asking broadcasters for support, Bush was talking to those
who would be most affected by any Cuban retaliation to TV Marti.
   On March 23, as U.S. authorities were gearing up to begin TV
Marti broadcasts, Cuba broadcast a radio speech by Castro to the
United States. AM stations along the Florida coast and as far away
as Nashville were disrupted.
   Broadcasters, however, were skeptical of the president's appeal.
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said, ``It's Castro's threat of jamming AM stations
that worries us.''
   He said that while U.S. AM radio stations are limited to 50,000
watts, ``Castro has the ability to go to 1 million wats.'' He said
the Cubans could theoretically jam radio stations literally across
the nation.
   He also said that the TV Marti transmitter itself, stationed on
a balloon in south Florida, was causing television interference to
Florida stations from Miami to Jacksonville.
   Later, Bush flew to Cincinnati and toured the GE Aircraft
Engines plant in Evendale, Ohio, where the engines for the new Air
Force One jumbo jet were made. The plant also recently signed a
deal to sell engines to the Soviet airline Aeroflot. Bush said that
shows ``the world's come a long way.'' He will also make stops in
Indianapolis and Detroit on Tuesday.
   Bush, embarking on a two-day, four-state trip mixing political
fund-raising with public appearances stressing competitiveness and
conservation, applauded the role television and radio broadcasts
played in inspiring the democratic revolutions that shook the
communist world over the past year.
   ``Television, which began as the American forum, has become the
world forum,'' said Bush.
   ``And so when a lone brave man stood up to a column of tanks in
Tiananmen Square, the world stood with him. When the people of
Prague sang the first Christmas carols in over 40 years, the world
sang with them. And when the first German took the first hammer to
that wall of shame in Berlin, the world shared in that historic act
of courage,'' said Bush.
   He said TV Marti was the latest addition to the arsenal of
American efforts to broadcast ``the truth'' to communist countries.
   ``The voice of freedom will not be stilled as long as there is
an America to tell the truth,'' said Bush, who also praised other
U.S. government broadcast outlets, including Radio Marti, Radio
Liberty, Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America.
   Echoing recent praise of Voice of America by Czechoslovakia's
new president, Vaclav Havel, Bush said, ``I am convinced that the
people of Cuba will thank us when they, too, win the liberty they
yearn for.''
   Bush said he could ``envision a time when the purpose of Radio
Free Europe and Radio Liberty could be utterly fulfilled. But for
now, these networks, along with USIA's Worldnet and VOA, must
continue in Eastern Europe until change is complete.''
   He said he has ordered an interagency review of the U.S.
government international broadcasts.
   He delivered the speech in the World Congress Center, home of
the 1988 Democratic Convention and next-door neighbor to the
headquarters of the Cable News Network.
   His main event in Cincinnati will be a fund-raiser for George
Voinovich, the former Cleveland mayor who is seeking to become
Ohio's first Republican governor since 1978.
   On Tuesday Bush flies to Indianapolis to plant a tree at an
Arbor Day ceremony and campaign for Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., trying
to win election to the seat he was appointed to last year when Dan
Quayle became vice president.
   Bush then heads for Detroit to attend an evening fund-raiser for
the Michigan GOP before returning to the White House on Tuesday
night.
   The largely political trek launches two months of heavy
presidential travel by Bush, who is seeking to emerge from the
November elections with a House and Senate friendlier to Republican
causes.
   As in recent campaign stops in California, Bush planned to
stress the importance of capturing or retaining governorships to
prevent Democratic gerrymandering in the redistricting that will
follow Sunday's national census.

<HEAD>Trial Begins for Inmate Accused of Killing Ex-Wife During Prison
Furlough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing his ex-wife
while he was on an eight-hour prison leave went on trial Monday in
a case that forced the governor to overhaul the prison furlough
program.
   Jury selection began for Alan Lehman Matheney, 39, who was
serving an eight-year sentence for assaulting his former wife, Lisa
Marie Bianco, on the day he allegedly chased her from her home and
clubbed her to death.
   Although a gag order prevents comments by the prosecution and
defense, Matheney's lead attorney, Scott L. King, has suggested he
will argue that his client was insane.
   Prosecutors say Ms. Bianco, 29, fled her home in terror on March
4, 1989, pursued by a man with a .410-gauge shotgun to a neighbor's
closed front door.
   There, her assailant clubbed her to the ground and, holding the
shotgun barrel in both hands, he struck her at least 15 more times,
shattering the wooden stock, authorities said. She died of a broken
skull.
   Ms. Bianco's daughters, then ages 6 and 10, were at home when
the attack occurred and may be called to testify.
   Matheney surrendered to police later that afternoon, around the
time his furlough from a central Indiana prison was to expire.
   Ms. Bianco, who had served as a counselor to battered women, was
mourned at her furneral by the women she had counseled. They said
she had emerged from a broken and violent relationship with new
courage and compassion _ and still lost.
   Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat mindful of national Republicans' use
of prison furloughs as a presidential political issue, immediately
suspended the state's furlough program and ordered an investigation.
   Bayh, who urged the prosecution to seek the death penalty, later
tightened restrictions in the Indiana prison furlough system to
block the release of prisoners under similar circumstances.
   Attorneys at Matheney's 1987 sentencing described the marriage
as an obsessive relationship of love and hate. Ms. Bianco yearned
to be free of him.
   ``If only I could get him put away for a year, I could put my
life back together again,'' she said at one point.
   Only days before her death, though, she admitted to friends
that, although she could never again live with Matheney, she still
loved him.
   Matheney allegedly made threatening telephone calls even from
prison. She asked authorities to inform her upon his release,
fearing his freedom would eventually cost her her life.
   Matheney and Bianco divorced in 1985, ending their seven-year
marriage but not their hostilities. In May 1987, Matheney was
convicted of criminal confinement after he disappeared for six
weeks with their daughters, Brooke and Nicole.
   The judge accused Matheney of using the children, then 6 and 2,
as pawns in an unsuccessful custody battle. He was sentenced to two
years in prison.
   Three months later, Matheney pleaded guilty to assaulting Ms.
Bianco at his home. Rape and confinement charges were dropped in
exchange for the guilty plea, but Matheney blamed her for the
unexpectedly stiff eight-year sentence.
   Guards at his minimum- to medium-security prison near Pendleton
called Matheney a well-behaved inmate, but during the six weeks
before Ms. Bianco's death, he was refused a furlough six times.
   Finally, on March 4, he was released into the custody of his
mother, Martha Matheney, and told not to leave central Indiana. Ms.
Bianco was not told of his release.
   Despite the travel order, the Matheneys drove north to the home
of a friend, authorities said. There, Matheney got the shotgun and
headed for Ms. Bianco's home to retrieve audiotapes he believed she
had recorded of their phone conversations, authorities said.
   Matheney said he couldn't explain why he carried the shotgun and
refused to answer when asked whether he had killed Ms. Bianco. He
would only say that her death resulted from an argument that got
out of hand.
   The trial is expected to last at least two weeks.

   Ryan White, the young AIDS patient whose
rejection by hometown classmates brought him sympathy and support
all over the world, was reported near death today, a state official
said.
   White, 18, was in critical condition this afternoon at Riley
Hospital for Children and was not expected to survive internal
bleeding that has left him unconscious, said Carrie Van Dyke,
director of health promotion for the State Board of Health.
   ``This is it. He's not expected to come out of it,'' Van Dyke
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``He's not
responding.
   ``I don't think it's the AIDS as much as he's a hemophiliac, and
he's bleeding internally, and that's the problem,'' Van Dyke said.
   White was diagnosed as having AIDS in December 1984 when he was
13. He contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome through a
blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia.
   The following year, he was barred from Western Middle School
near Kokomo after school officials and parents there rejected
health authorities' reassurances that AIDS cannot be spread through
casual contact.
   After months of school board battles and court hearings, White
won the right to attend school.
   However, pressures on his family later drove the Whites to the
town of Cicero, where he was enrolled at Hamilton Heights High
School. In Cicero, townspeople and fellow students rallied around
him and befriended him.
   He has become a national spokesman for children with AIDS,
appearing at congressional hearings and fund-raisers, and the story
of his life was told in a 1989 television movie. White had a small
role in the film.
   White was befriended by such celebrities as Michael Jackson.
   White was admitted to Riley Hospital on Thursday, said hospital
spokeswoman Mary Maxwell.
   Van Dyke said the hemophilia, a disorder that impairs blood's
ability to clot, prevented doctors from taking extraordinary
measures that would prolong White's life.
   He celebrated his birthday in December in ill health, with a low
blood platelet count and staph infections in his eyes and legs.
   But he continued his efforts to help fellow AIDS patients.
   Last week, he appeared with former President Reagan and his
wife, Nancy, at a Los Angeles event sponsored by Athletes and
Entertainers for Kids, which established the Ryan White National
Program for AIDS education in his honor.
   Van Dyke said she had became close to White while they prepared
public-service announcements for World AIDS Day in December.

   Singer Gloria Estefan will be allowed to go home
this week to continue her rehabilitation from two fractured
vertebrae, a hospital spokeswoman said Monday.
   Estefan has been at the Orthopedic Institute Hospital for Joint
Diseases, where doctors on March 22 implanted two steel rods in her
back.
   She will be released Wednesday, said hospital spokeswoman Mary
Costello.
   The operation came one day after she was injured when her tour
bus was struck by a tractor-trailer in northeast Pennsylvania.
Doctors said after surgery that it would take the Cuban-born
performer up to six months to fully recover.
   Estefan, 32, was nominated for a Grammy Award this year for
``Don't Wanna Lose You,'' a song from her solo album.

Currency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to
placate angry East Germans on Monday after the head of Bonn's
central bank suggested swapping East German marks 2-to-1 for West
German marks.
   Postal workers in the East German city of Suhl held a warning
strike Monday to press for a 1-to-1 exchange rate. East Germany's
Labor Union Federation urged a nationwide demonstration Thursday.
   East Germans were expecting to get a powerful West German mark
for each of their East German marks under a common currency
expected to be worked out sometime this summer.
   Karl Otto Poehl, the influential head of West Germany's central
bank _ the Bundesbank _ suggested the 2-to-1 conversion rate.
   The suggestion raised allegations Kohl was breaking campaign
promises made before the March 18 East German elections. An
alliance favoring quick reunification won the vote, in part because
of campaigning by Kohl.
   Both German states have agreed to set up a common currency as a
crucial step toward unification, with West Germany eventually
taking over East Germany's economic policies. Bonn would like the
currency union in place by July 1.
   Kohl said Monday his government will ``carefully examine the
Bundesbank's recommendation'' and insisted no decision had been
made on what exchange rate to use.
   The chancellor said he recognizes his ``responsibility to the
people'' of East Germany, saying, ``I have repeatedly underlined
this commitment to solidarity during the East German election
campaign, and I stand by it.''
   During the campaign, Kohl promised that East German private
savings would not be decimated by monetary union. He said East
Germans would be protected from economic shocks when the currency
union takes effect.
   But the Bundesbank repeated its demand that East German marks be
exchanged 2-to-1, with the exception of a 1-to-1 conversion for
personal savings of up to 2,000 Eastern marks.
   ``A conversion rate of 1-to-1 would expose the East German
economy to an indebtedness and a cost level with which most
companies couldn't cope in international competition,'' the
Bundesbank said in a statement.
   Financial experts have previously cautioned that many East
German factories and shops would not be able to afford wages and
pensions if East German marks were traded for Western marks at
parity. There have been forecasts up to 2 million East Germans
could lose their jobs.
   The Bundesbank controls the West German money supply. It has
demanded full control of East German monetary policy when currency
union occurs.
   The Bundesbank also wants limits on new borrowings by the East
German public sector.
   There were clear signs of tension between Kohl's government and
the Bundesbank over the issue of conversion rates.
   Helmut Haussmann, West Germany's economics minister, said a
decision on conversion rates will be made by the government and not
by the bank.
   ``The Bundesbank has made a recommendation. The decision will be
made by politics,'' he told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the Bundesbank's
recommendations do not mark ``the last word'' on a conversion rate.
   Genscher said that for East German pensions especially, a more
favorable rate must be considered than 2-to-1.
   ``That is not acceptable. How could anyone be expected to live
with such a pension?'' Genscher said in an interview with
Deutschlandfunk radio.
   Lothar de Maiziere, East Germany's premier-designate, warned the
East German exodus to West Germany could swell again if his
countrymen sense monetary union could do them more harm than good.
   ``In that case, we would be able to keep the people here only
with great difficulties,'' said de Maiziere.

<HEAD>De Klerk to Toughen Security in Troubled Province</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk said
Monday he would send police and military reinforcements to a
troubled province where hundreds of blacks have died in a virtual
civil war between rival factions.
   De Klerk also said he would meet African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela on Thursday, and he proposed an amnesty for
politically motivated criminal acts.
   He criticized the ANC for pulling out of talks with the
white-led government and for its continued commitment to a
guerrilla campaign.
   ``It is difficult to understand why an organization saying it is
interested in peace refuses to come and talk about that very
issue,'' de Klerk told Parliament in Cape Town.
   The ANC announced Saturday it was postponing talks in protest of
a March 26 police shooting of black demonstrators in Sebokeng, a
township south of Johannesburg. At least nine people were killed
and 400 were injured.
   De Klerk said police and military units were being strengthened
in the southeastern province of Natal, the scene of fierce fighting
between rival groups of blacks in recent weeks.
   The security forces will play a more visible role, setting up
roadblocks and patrolling troubled areas by road and helicopter, de
Klerk said.
   ``Everyone must understand that these decisions could lead to a
rise in the number of people being detained,'' he added.
   More than 30,000 people have been detained without trial for
varying lengths of time under a state of emergency in effect since
June 1986. However, no more than a few dozen people presently are
in detention.
   De Klerk warned black radicals and extremist whites that ``we
are deadly serious about building the new South Africa without
brutality and without unrest.''
   De Klerk said the violence is jeopardizing plans to arrange
black-white negotiations on a new constitution.
   ``The maintenance of law and order can never be compared to
anarchistic violence,'' he said. ``Therefore, purposeful and strong
action will be taken to maintain good order.''
   Mandela renewed his appeal for peace during a visit to Edendale,
a Natal township that has been the site of some of the worst
fighting.
   ``We are not fighting Inkatha (a rival black group),'' Mandela
told 2,000 people crammed into a church hall. ``We are fighting
apartheid and the forces of oppression.''
   Police in Natal said vicious battles between ANC supporters and
Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization, had left at
least 53 people dead and hundreds injured since last Tuesday. Local
reporters said the death toll could range up to 100.
   The two organizations have been fighting for supremacy in Natal
since 1986, resulting in some 4,000 deaths. In Natal, both the ANC
supporters and Inkatha members are Zulus. Neutral observers blame
both groups for the violence.
   In his speech to Parliament, de Klerk said the government will
propose legislation allowing authorities to grant amnesty for
politically motivated criminal acts.
   The full details were not released. But it appeared such
legislation, if enacted, would allow the government to free
hundreds of imprisoned activists and permit exiled ANC members to
return to South Africa without fear of prosecution. The release of
imprisoned activists is a leading demand of the ANC and other
organizations.
   De Klerk said cases would be considered individually and
``blanket indemnity is not being considered.''
   But he added: ``With these steps the government proves it is not
blind to the problems of the moment. The groundwork for the
creation of a climate conducive to negotiation ... must continue.''
   The government released seven ANC prisoners Monday from Robben
Island Prison off Cape Town. More than 50 activists have been freed
in the past two months.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other black opposition groups in
February to try to clear the way for negotiations on a new
constitution that will include the country's 28-million black
majority.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy on Monday denied
allegations it tried to kidnap from jail an Air Force sergeant
convicted of killing his wife.
   U.S. military efforts to gain custody of the man have angered
Dutch officials.
   The controversy stems from an incident Friday night, when eight
U.S. enlisted men and officers came to the Utrecht jail where Staff
Sgt. Charles D. Short is housed. The Dutch High Court was to rule
on his extradition the same day.
   The court later ruled against the U.S. extradition request
because Short, 34, of Highwood, Ill., could face the death penalty
in the United States for the 1988 slaying.
   The Americans were spotted by prison guards who called the
police, reports said. They were then told to leave.
   The episode made front-page news in several major Dutch
newspapers. The nation's most reputable newspaper, NRC Handelsblad,
described it as a ``kidnapping'' attempt in its headline.
   ``The Americans are way off the mark here. They should keep
their paws off Short, or else there'll be a serious diplomatic
incident,'' said an unidentified Justice Ministry spokesman on
Dutch television.
   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in The Hague said the eight unarmed
servicemen, including Short's commander, a legal officer, three
military policemen and three drivers had been waiting for him at
the jail.
   The statement said the men had orders to take Short into custody
only if extradition were approved.
   ``There was never any intent on the part of USAF officials to
apprehend Staff Sgt. Short without the full authorization and
consent of the Netherlands authorities,'' the statement said.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Victor Holtus said negotiations with
U.S. officials were still going on in the case, but he would not
disclose details.
   A Dutch court sentenced Short to six years' imprisonment Oct.
11, 1988, on homicide charges. He was convicted of killing his
Turkish-born wife, Esin Hasturk, cutting her body into pieces, and
dumping the remains in plastic bags.
   An appeals court in Amsterdam ruled later that the Dutch legal
system has no jurisdiction over Short. That could lead to his
release.
   Dutch law, which has no capital punishment, bans extradition
when a suspect might be executed.

<HEAD>International Group Says Soviets Still Abuse Psychiatry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of political prisoners in Soviet mental
institutions may have declined sharply, but the abuse of
psychiatric practices remains widespread, an international group
said Monday.
   ``The abuses continue and the abusers are still in place,'' the
International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry said
in a statement.
   Robert Van Voren, the general secretary of the Netherlands
group, said the situation in the Soviet Union remains a ``cause of
concern.''
   Van Voren, who recently visited the Soviet Union, said
affiliated groups in that nation have files on 40 political
prisoners kept in psychiatric hospitals. That compares with about
1,000 five years ago.
   He said it was not possible to estimate the total number of
political prisoners under psychiatric care because many patients
were being shifted to remote areas.
   ``It is clear that authorities are still trying to cover up
abuses,'' he said.
   Van Voren said the Soviet Interior Ministry still maintains
control over what he estimated to be more than 1,000 psychiatric
hospitals throughout the country.
   ``There are still watchtowers with machine guns, still guards
with dogs, still barbed wire, and doctors are still holding
military ranks'' at those hospitals, he said.
   Van Voren said the situation in most of the hospitals has not
improved since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985. Recently
instituted legal changes ``give only theoretical rights to
patients,'' Van Voren said.
   He hailed the formation of independent psychiatric associations
in Moscow, Leningrad and Estonia and said there were ``very strong
attempts'' by lawyers and activists to reform Soviet psychiatry.
   Van Voren said the Soviet media have been writing openly about
current abuses, including a case in which a declared candidate in a
local election was taken to a psychiatric hospital on orders from
the opposing Communist Party candidate.
   But he said the leadership of the official Soviet All-Union
Society for Psychiatry has remained in power despite promises from
the organization for changes when it was readmitted to the World
Psychiatric Association in October.
   Van Voren's group opposed that readmission and said Monday ``it
would be a good thing to reconsider that membership.''

   In the days before he was gunned down on a
Memphis motel balcony, Martin Luther King Jr. was a pressured,
worried man who found himself the leader of a slowing movement.
   According to aides, King was on a roller coaster of optimism and
doubt. He was still getting criticism for a 1967 speech against the
war in Vietnam, and was troubled because he had been unable to keep
a Memphis, Tenn., march from turning into a riot. He worried about
young blacks' new appetite for violence.
   Nearly 22 years after a sniper's bullet killed King on April 4,
1968, his last days have generated renewed interest, in part
because of his closest aide's contention that King spent time with
two women on the night before he died.
   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy's account of April 3, 1968, has
been condemned as false by other black leaders and a woman who says
she served dinner to King at her home that night. Abernathy, who
spent the entire civil rights movement with King, stood by his
version as true.
   Abernathy said he decided to reveal King's alleged activities
because he wanted to portray his friend's human side.
   But that human side, according to friends and biographers,
already was evident by late March 1968.
   King felt other black leaders no longer trusted his judgment.
They had rained criticism on him for his April 4, 1967, speech
against the Vietnam War.
   ``He was concerned and troubled by people who were supposed to
be close to him and had been his colleagues but didn't share his
position on the war in Vietnam,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a
former student activist who worked with King through the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.
   But Lewis said he saw King frequently in the spring of 1968, and
``I never saw him in a state of depression. He was looking forward
to organizing and mobilizing.''
   King aide Hosea Williams, a former Atlanta city councilman, said
other black leaders placed ``all the pressure in the world'' on
King for his anti-war position.
   ``He was having some real problems. He suffered severely,''
Williams said.
   Abernathy said King was depressed before his death. When a
protest he led in Memphis in late March 1968 turned into a riot,
King worried that people no longer would adhere to non-violence as
a tool for social change.
   He wondered if he should step aside and ``let violence run its
course,'' Abernathy wrote in his 1989 autobiography, ``And the
Walls Came Tumbling Down.''
   King returned to Memphis on April 3, 1968, ``to prove you could
still have a non-violent, peaceful march,'' planned for April 5 on
behalf of striking Memphis trash collectors.
   The night he arrived, King delivered his ``mountaintop'' speech.
   ``He was at the height of his powers,'' Abernathy wrote. ``I
never saw him better.''
   Afterward, according to Abernathy, King went to dinner at the
home of a female friend, and went into a bedroom with her for about
two hours. Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu of Memphis, known then as Tarlease
Mathews, agrees that King and Abernathy came to her home. But she
says it was Abernathy who went into the bedroom _ and passed out
from having too much to drink.
   She has filed a $10 million libel suit against Abernathy and his
publisher, Harper &amp; Row.
   Abernathy said King later spent part of the night with another
woman and then got into a pushing match with a third.
   Biographer Stephen B. Oates wrote in his 1982 book, ``Let the
Trumpet Sound,'' that King went back to the Lorraine Motel after
his speech and was ``relaxed and happy'' while he worked on sermons.
   According to biographer David Garrow, King went to dinner at the
home of NAACP leader Benjamin Hooks, then returned to the hotel,
where he ``chatted and joked'' with his brother, A.D., until nearly
dawn.
   On his last day, former aides say, King was cheerful, optimistic
and playful. According to Garrow's book, ``Bearing the Cross,''
King pummeled Andrew Young in an impromptu pillow fight hours
before his assassination.
   ``Occasionally he would get in those kinds of hilarious moods,''
recalled Young, the former Atlanta mayor.

   Donald Trump put a zillion simoleons
in play money on the line Monday, opening his $1 billion Taj Mahal
Casino Resort for a dry run where the only real action fed the slot
machines.
   Outside on the Boardwalk, the crowd gathered until security
guards stepped aside at 10 a.m. and let visitors onto the
120,000-square-foot casino floor for the first time.
   ``I'm amazed to see how many people are here at this time of the
morning,'' Trump said, shaking employees' hands and autographing
mock $10 bills patrons must use until state gaming regulators give
the go-ahead for real money.
   Slot machines, needing no break-in period, were open for cold
cash.
   Gamblers said they came from all over the country attracted by
the chance to see Trump's third casino, a 17-acre site with $14
million in chandeliers alone, 1,250 rooms and more than 3,000 slot
machines.
   ``I figured this would be pretty remarkable so I took the day
off,'' said Brent Blanchard, 27, of Palmyra.
   Trump, accompanied by three bodyguards, arrived five minutes
after the opening and led about 30 reporters and dozens more
curiosity seekers on a 20-minute tour.
   About 50 state Division of Gaming Enforcement investigators went
into action, checking whether dealers knew their games and that
proper internal controls, surveillance and accounting procedures
were in place.
   The division reports its findings to the Casino Control
Commission after the casino closes, and the commission decides
whether to allow limited table betting with real money on Tuesday
or extend the test period.
   New Jersey regulations require new casinos to use play money at
table games such as craps, blackjack and baccarat during test
periods.
   Patrons can buy $10 worth of play money for $1 in real money.
The gamblers get to win more play money and the casino's take goes
to seven local charities.
   Patrons seemed more interested in spotting Trump than in trying
their luck in the casino named after a 16th century Indian
mausoleum. One woman shrieked, ``I touched him,'' in the middle of
his zig-zag tour of the casino floor.
   Patrons issued a mixed verdict on the impact of Atlantic City's
largest casino _ a third larger than the 90,000-square-foot
TropWorld Entertainment and Casino Resort.
   Some said they only came for a first peek at a casino that has
been under construction for eight years and must win at least $1
million a day to service the debt on $675 million in bonds.
   One minor controversy marred an otherwise perfect media event:
The Riviera Casino in Las Vegas disputed Trump's claim that his new
casino's 120,000-square-foot gaming floor is the world's largest.
   Riviera officials say their 125,000 square feet gives them the
world's largest casino, despite statements in all the literature
given to reporters by Taj Mahal officials that the Taj Mahal is the
biggest.
   ``I've always heard we're the largest,'' Trump said. ``It's
acknowledged to be the largest casino in the world.''
   The billionaire developer then cited the Taj Mahal's
``grandeur'' and scope, minimizing the flap over size. ``You
understand that's the least important part,'' he said. ``At some
point, perhaps this will be topped.''

<HEAD>Defense: Bloody Invasion Should End Noriega Prosecution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Antonio Noriega's defense put a former U.S.
attorney general on the witness stand Monday and claimed the
invasion of Panama was bloodier and more destructive than the
government has admitted.
   The testimony, which included videotapes of invasion violence
and the arrest of the deposed Panamanian leader, was aimed at
convincing U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler that Noriega should
be freed to demonstrate that the government's executive branch is
subject to the rule of law.
   ``Nothing General Noriega is accused of is equivalent to what
happened, to the force that was used to bring him to the United
States,'' defense attorney Jon May said. ``We have to recognize
that the methods we use sometimes make us worse than the people we
are trying to arrest.''
   The prosecution avoided discussions of United States conduct
during the Dec. 20 invasion, with Deputy Solicitor General William
Bryson calling the issue ``legally irrelevant.'' He said there was
ample legal precedent showing the court could maintain jurisdiction
over Noriega whether or not the government violated his rights.
   For the defense, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who
served under presidents Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960s, was put
on the stand as a representative of an ad hoc group called the
Independent Commission of Inquiry on the U.S. Invasion of Panama.
   Clark, who toured Panama in January, is one of the most
prominent members of the private group, which also includes author
Graham Greene.
   Clark was questioned about the number of civilian deaths in
Panama, which the Defense Department has put at between 200 and 300.
   ``I heard of estimates ranging as high as 7,000,'' Clark told
the judge. ``I still believe it will be at least a thousand, and
probably several thousand _ you never will know the absolute
number.''
   But he refused to condemn the use of what the defense said were
inhumane weapons used in attacks on civilians, including cluster
bombs and artillery.
   On cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael
Sullivan, Clark acknowledged his stay in Panama was brief and that
much of his information was second-hand.
   Before Clark's testimony, defense attorney Frank Rubino
presented videotape of invasion coverage from the major networks
and Panamanian television, much of it aimed at showing the
widespread destruction and homelessness caused by the invasion.
   Throughout the tape Noriega sat impassively in his general's
uniform at the defense table, except for a twitch once when the
film showed him in captivity aboard a U.S.-bound military transport
plane.
   Key to the arguments is a 1974 case called United States vs.
Toscanino, in which a federal appellate court ruled that behavior
``shocking to the conscience'' during the arrest of a defendant,
even outside the United States, could be grounds for freeing him.
   The U.S. attorney's office defended the invasion, calling
civilian deaths ``an unfortunate, unavoidable byproduct'' of any
military action in an urban area. Prosecutors also question the
findings and integrity of the private investigatory commission.
   Prosecutors also point out that the U.S. Supreme Court has never
accepted the Toscanino rule. In fact, they say, the high court
recently ruled in United States vs. Verdugo-Urquidez that the
Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search and seizure does
not apply to non-citizens outside the country.
   Noriega faces 145 years in prison if convicted of a variety of
drug counts in a February 1988 indictment that accused him of
accepting bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn
Panama into a way station for U.S.-bound cocaine. The judge on
Monday again insisted that the trial will go ahead as scheduled on
Jan. 28, 1991.

   President Bush, saying ``the voice of freedom
will not be stilled,'' told broadcasters Monday that the
government's TV Marti will keep transmitting into Cuba despite
concerns that Fidel Castro may widen his jamming of U.S. radio
stations.
   He also told a National Association of Broadcasters convention
that Voice of America signals will still be beamed into Eastern
Europe ``until change is complete.''
   There, ``free stations and newspapers are still struggling to
take root. ... We need to be there now more than ever before _ to
describe and explain our own two centuries of experience in
building a democracy,'' Bush said.
   He addressed the broadcasting organization's annual meeting as
he began a two-day trip that will also take him to Cincinnati,
Indianapolis and Detroit _ mostly to help raise funds for
Republican candidates.
   Bush waded into a sensitive area with broadcasters, particularly
in the Southeast, who are concerned about Cuban retaliation against
TV Marti,
   After testing of the television station began last Tuesday,
Castro jammed the signals of AM radio stations in the region.
Within Cuba, Castro jammed TV Marti's signal with varying success.
   ``Look, I do understand the practical concerns some of you have
about this. But I also understand that you represent the very
principle TV Marti exists to serve _ the free flow of ideas,'' Bush
said.
   ``So I have come here to ask something of you,'' Bush implored
the broadcasters. ``I ask you, once again, to stand for TV Marti,
to stand for freedom.''
   ``The voice of freedom will not be stilled as long as there is
an America to tell the truth,'' Bush told the audience to subdued
applause.
   Broadcasters, however, were skeptical of the president's appeal.
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the broadcasters' organization,
said, ``It's Castro's threat of jamming AM stations that worries

   He said that while U.S. AM radio stations are limited to 50,000
watts, ``Castro has the ability to go to 1 million watts.'' With
such high-powered transmitters, he said, the Cubans could
theoretically jam radio stations nationwide.
   He also said that the TV Marti signal, emanating from a balloon
off South Florida, was causing television interference to Florida
stations from Miami to Jacksonville
   The president also praised broadcasters for bringing to the
world the ``sounds and images of the Revolution of '89.''
   ``So when a lone brave man stood up to a column of tanks in
Tiananmen Square, the world stood with him. When the people of
Prague sang the first Christmas carols in over 40 years, the world
sang with them. And when the first German took the first hammer to
that wall of shame in Berlin, the world shared in a historic act of
courage,'' he said.
   While in Atlanta, Bush made a pitch for the city's bid to host
the 1996 Summer Olympics, meeting with several members of the
International Olympic Committee who were checking out what the city
has to offer.
   Bush flew from Atlanta to Cincinnati, where he toured a General
Electric jet engine plant. Noting that GE recently signed a
contract to build engines for Aeroflot, the Soviet national
airline, the president commented, ``The world has come a long way.''

   Later, at a $1,000-a-plate fundraising dinner for Republican
gubernatorial candidate George Voinovich, Bush said the GE plant
demonstrated ``the kind of high-tech, precision manufacturing'' of
which U.S. workers are capable.
   But he added that ``if American industry is going to keep its
competitive edge in the future, America's schools have got to be
first-class. Education is the key.''

   On Tuesday, the president plans to attend a tree-planting
ceremony in Indianapolis and a fundraising luncheon for Republican
Sen. Dan Coats' November re-election effort. He was to wrap up the
trip in Detroit with another fundraiser, this one for Michigan GOP
candidates.
   In his speech to the broadcasters here, the president said that
television, ``which began as an American forum, has become the
world forum.'' He spoke in Atlanta's Georgia World Congress Center.
   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters aboard Air Force One that Bush would meet on Wednesday
with two high-level emissaries from Japan sent by Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu to discuss trade disputes.
   Kaifu called Bush early Monday, Fitzwater said. He said Kaifu
expressed a ``personal commitment to solving problems.''

   The State Department denounced on Monday as
``inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous'' a threat by
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to use chemical weapons against
Israel.
   ``In a region already volatile enough, nobody should be
trumpeting chemical weapons,'' spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
said. ``They should be trumpeting their destruction.''
   However, the State Department has not officially determined the
accuracy of the statement and is condemning it if reports of
Saddam's warning are true. Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The Iraqi president, in a speech broadcast by the state radio,
was quoted as categorically denying that his country had any atomic
bombs. ``But let them hear here and now that we do posses binary
chemical weapons, which only the United States and the Soviet Union
also have,'' he said.
   Saddam reportedly threatened to use them in retaliation, if
Israel attacked, and to destroy half the Jewish state.
   ``We have seen these reports, and if they are true, what we have
seen is inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said, reading from a prepared statement that she described as
`'very strong.''
   A few minutes later, the State Department lashed out at Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for an aide's announcement on Sunday
indicating work would begin on five new Jewish settlements on the
West Bank.
   ``The creation of additional settlements are not conducive to
the peace process, and in fact we see them as an obstacle to
peace,'' Ms. Tutwiler said, again reading from a prepared
settlement.
   ``It's disturbing that an Israeli leadership which was unable to
move forward on peace seems ready to move forward on new
settlements,'' the U.S. official said.
   The criticism was aimed directly at Shamir whose Likud coalition
withheld approval of a formula by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III for talks between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   The Labor party had urged acceptance of the proposal. The
dispute tore apart the Israeli government and Baker's initiative is
stalled.
   Two years ago, the Likud-Labor partnership approved eight new
settlements. Construction was begun on three, while the five others
were held up.
   On Sunday, Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Shamir, said ``there
were artificial delays until now, and) they will be removed.''
   But on Monday, Avi Pazner, an adviser to the prime minister,
denied there had been a ``new decision'' to go ahead with the five
settlements. He said Shamir's caretaker government, which is
temporarily in charge, ``only continues the policy of the
government of national unity and there are no plans to establish
any new settlements.''
   On another development, meanwhile, the State Department
responded cautiously to reports that the Palestine Liberation
Organization had rebuilt its armed forces in Lebanon to exceed the
level in 1982 when Israeli troops invaded the country and forced
their departure.
   ``We are aware that the number of armed groups, including
Palestinians, has increased in Lebanon,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Again, careful not to single out the PLO, she said the presence
of all these groups complicates Lebanon's problems and that all
foreign forces should be withdrawn.
   Asked about a report that Al Fatah, the mainstream PLO group,
was conducting exercises to prepare for raids against Israel, Ms.
Tutwiler said: ``I do not have a reaction to it.'' She said she
would check on the report.
   In criticizing Iraq, the State Department again condemned the
proliferation of chemical weapons.
   Last week, in a related action, Undersecretary of State Richard
McCormack registered concern with Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed
al-Mashat that the Arab country is trying to circumvent U.S.
restrictions on nuclear technology shipments.
   ``We do not foresee a near-time Iraqi nuclear capability,''
spokesman Richard Boucher said on Friday. ``However, we remain
concerned about the danger...''
   McCormack also reiterated U.S. opposition to the spread of
missile technology in the Middle East, said a U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iraq in December launched a long-range three-stage rocket that
is believed capable of reaching Israel.
   Last Wednesday, British customs officials of a shipment of
U.S.-made nuclear trigger components destined for Iraq. The FBI
cooperated in the case.

   Lithuania's president Monday invited Kremlin
officials to Lithuania to discuss the republic's secession drive
and struck a conciliatory note by saying Lithuania wants gradual,
not immediate, full independence.
   While government officials sought a compromise solution to the
dispute, 1,000 pro-independence demonstrators rallied at the
Lithuanian prosecutor's office to protest its occupation by Soviet
soldiers.
   Washington deplored Moscow for ordering all 100 foreign
journalists in the republic to leave by Monday.
   There was no immediate response from Moscow to the invitation
from President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania.
   Landsbergis told Lithuanian legislators that officials face
``political difficulties'' in dealing with Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence.
   ``Therefore it is essential to look for a way of helping them
and ourselves,'' he said in comments carried on Lithuanian Radio
and monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   Gorbachev faces independence movements in several of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics. Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, Estonia
and Latvia, were annexed after the Soviets took control of them
under the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1940.
   The Lithuanian declaration of independence ``may seem to some
people ... a demand that power be handed over the very next day,''
Landsbergis said. ``We did not expect this and did not count upon
it.''
   Instead, Landsbergis told legislators the republic had stated
``how by means of agreements and a gradual takeover of certain
functions, we would consolidate our independence.''
   Gorbachev has said talks on independence can take place only if
Lithuania renounces its declaration of March 11. He has pressured
the republic to do so by sending Red Army soldiers to take over
public buildings in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.
   Refusal to take back the declaration of independence may result
in ``grave consequences for all of us,'' Gorbachev said in a
statement to Lithuanians on Saturday.
   In a telegram sent to Gorbachev on Monday morning, Landsbergis
indicated that legislators would debate a full response, and he
invited a Kremlin representative to take part in the discussion to
explain Moscow's stand.
   Landsbergis also sent a delegation to Moscow in the hopes of
starting negotiations in the Soviet capital.
   Spokesmen for the Lithuanian Supreme Council said legislator
Egidius Bickauskas had gone to Moscow in hopes of meeting with
Soviet leaders, and that three other people including Deputy
Premier Romualdas Ozolas were following.
   Bickauskas has spent much of the past two weeks in Moscow trying
without success to begin talks.
   About 1,000 pro-independence demonstrators rallied outside the
Lithuanian prosecutor's office against the occupation of the
building Friday night by Soviet soldiers.
   Both a prosecutor appointed by Lithuania's breakaway government
and one sent from Moscow were working in the building Monday,
employees said. They reported a tense atmosphere but no direct
conflicts between the two.
   Carla Gruodis, a legislative spokeswoman, also said a member of
the minority Communist Party that remained loyal to Moscow had told
editors of pro-independence newspapers they could not have their
newspapers published at the country's main printing plant.
   A handful of soldiers occupied that building early Saturday.
   Ms. Gruodis said Juozas Kuolelis, former head of state radio and
television in Lithuania, called a meeting at the printing
headquarters and told workers he had a decree from the national
Communist Party Central Committee and the Soviet Council of
Ministers. He said the decree gave the loyalist Communist Party the
exclusive right to use the building.
   Ms. Gruodis said the plant manager and workers told Kuolelis
they were determined to continue printing pro-independence
newspapers despite the order.
   Papers owned by the Lithuanian government that support the
independence drive, and publications of the pro-independence
Sajudis political movement, are printed at the plant.
   The State Department criticized Moscow's decision to expel
Western journalists from Lithuania and called on Moscow not to use
intimidation, coercion or military force to crush the Baltic
nation's independence movement.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will raise the Lithuanian subject during his meetings in
Washington later this week with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.

   The State Department on Monday deplored the
Soviet Union's decision to expel Western journalists from Lithuania
and called on Moscow not to use intimidation, coercion or military
force to crush the Baltic nation's independence movement.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will raise the Lithuanian
crisis during his meetings here later this week with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``We have consistently advocated peaceful change,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said as she repeated U.S. support for ``Lithuania's desire to
achieve peaceful self-determination'' through negotiations with
Moscow.
   ``It is not our place to prescribe the precise solution to the
conflict,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She expressed the hope that ``every peaceful means'' will be
explored to resolve the situation, urging that nothing be done by
either side to preclude a dialogue on Lithuania's future.
   The Soviets have seized Lithuanian government and Communist
Party offices, rolled armored vehicles through the streets of
Vilnius in a show of force and ordered all Western journalists to
leave the country by midnight Sunday.
   ``We regret the action that was taken yesterday,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said, referring to the Soviet expulsion of reporters. ``You all
know how strongly we support freedom of the press.''
   But she declined to characterize or define what Soviet actions
would represent coercion, intimidation or the use of force.
   ``We have been on the record as saying that the use of force
would be counterproductive and have an adverse impact on our
relations,'' she said.
   ``It is important that the United States continue to call for
the resolution of this issue through dialogue, through negotiations
in a peaceful manner so that ultimately the people of Lithuania can
indeed enjoy genuine independence.
   ``As we've expressed in the past, we are deeply concerned and we
continue to be so,'' she said.

<HEAD>Woman Leaves Estate to `Mr. Pig' and Dog</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 81-year-old woman left nearly her
entire $600,000 estate to make sure a pet pig and her dog are taken
care of for the rest of their lives.
   Neighbors said Margo Lamp loved animals and was especially fond
of her German shepherd named Calamity Jane _ Cammy for short _ and
a runt hog called Mr. Pig. The pig followed her around the yard, on
the porch and sometimes in the house.
   ``There was certainly no question about the pig being a pet,''
said George Goebel, attorney for Ms. Lamp's estate. ``He would come
up and rub against your pant leg, and she fed him cat food.''
   About 100 less social pigs on the farm have been sold since her
death six weeks ago.
   Ms. Lamp left bequests of $1,000 each to friends in Colorado and
Germany but left the rest to her animals.
   Ms. Lamp said in her will that the pets should be taken care of
with the profits from her farm near Davenport in eastern Iowa and
other assets. The estate goes to the Scott County Humane Society
after the needs of the pets are met.
   Neighbors said Ms. Lamp lived a solitary life but kept abreast
of world events by subscribing to four newspapers and traveling to
New York once a year to visit art museums.
   ``She used to say she believed in solitude and that there was a
difference between solitude and loneliness,'' said a neighbor, Jack
Armstrong.
   The farm was first run by Ms. Lamp's father, Hugo Lamp. It was
one of the first in the area to have a combine.
   Ms. Lamp, who never married, lived alone on the 320-acre farm.
She lost interest in the place when a hired man died in 1975 and
allowed the buildings to become run down.
   Louis Nielsen, president of the Scott County Humane Society,
said the society will collect rent on the farm while Mr. Pig and
Cammy are alive. After that, the society may do as it wishes with
the farm.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Reach One-Year Agreement on Drift-Net Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese negotiators reached
agreement on a one-year pact to triple the number of observers on
Japanese drift-net boats and equip all the vessels with monitoring
transmitters, the State Department said Monday.
   Critics, however, said the pact would provide observers for only
10 percent of Japan's drift-net vessels and allow the Japanese to
continue to fish the cold, salmon-rich waters south of the Aleutian
Islands.
   ``We still fall short of our goal of eliminating high-seas drift
nets, but this is quite an improvement over last year's
agreement,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   A spokesman for the State Department's Office of Oceans,
Environment and Science, Tom Snead, said department negotiator Ed
Wolfe had reached the agreement over the weekend in Japan.
   The pact calls for 98 vessels from Japan's squid and large-mesh
drift-net fleets to be monitored in the 1990 fishing season by 47
U.S., 41 Japanese and 10 Canadian observers. Last year, 32 Japanese
drift-net vessels were covered by observers.
   ``Now we don't have to play hide-and-seek with the Japanese,''
Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., said.
   ``The U.S. has made a step in the right direction, but it's not
the final answer. Massive drift-netting efforts need to be
eliminated. Drift nets take too many fish and kill too many marine
mammals and sea birds,'' he said.
   The monitoring transmitters will send signals to satellites,
enabling the government to tell when the vessels enter waters where
drift-netting is illegal. Critics of drift-netting say the
miles-long nets illegally capture North America-spawned salmon and
kill thousands of marine birds and mammals.

   The man once considered the likely premier of
East Germany's first democracy stepped down as leader of the Social
Democrats on Monday amid allegations he had ties to the hated
secret police.
   Ibrahim Boehme became the second major political figure in East
Germany to quit because of reputed involvement with the security
apparatus of the former Stalinist regime.
   Thousands of people demonstrated in Dresden and Magdeburg on
Monday to protest the purported connections between new lawmakers
and the former secret police and to demand a full investigation of
Parliament, the government news service ADN reported.
   Fifteen prominent East German social leaders and intellectuals,
including writer Christa Wolf, issued a statement also demanding a
probe.
   Boehme, who twice lost jobs because he spoke out against the
former Communist government, on Friday inspected the files kept on
him by the feared network known as the Stasi. He fainted and was
hospitalized after seeing the files, the party said.
   Boehme decided to resign after realizing that clearing his name
will require ``lengthy investigations'' and make it more difficult
to form East Germany's first democratic government, said August
Kamilli, a high-ranking Social Democrat.
   Boehme, 46, also cited health problems, including heart troubles
and an inner ear infection, said Markus Meckel, the party's deputy
chairman and Boehme's likely successor.
   Kamilli said Boehme wrote a letter Sunday telling of his plan to
quit.
   The party denied a television report that Boehme tried to kill
himself after reading the Stasi files. He was released from the
hospital after an examination and was reported staying with
friends. He has not been seen in public since he waved to reporters
after leaving Stasi headquarters Friday.
   East Germany has been thrown into a political crisis by charges
that many of the newly elected members of the 400-seat Parliament
had links to the Stasi.
   Lothar de Maiziere, leader of the Christian Democrat-led
coalition that won the most Parliament seats March 18, has been
accused of being a Stasi informant. He denied the allegations.
   The charges have overshadowed efforts by de Maiziere's group to
forge a governing coalition with the Social Democrats and clear the
way for reunification with West Germany.
   Meckel said the Stasi network was so vast that ``only with
international help can the country be free of the Stasi's
influence.'' He said a situation had developed where virtually
everyone had come under suspicion.
   Last week, Boehme examined the voluminous dossiers of the Stasi,
which are under control of a government-appointed group working to
disband the network.
   Boehme's attorney, Friedrich-Wilhelm von Sell, said no
incriminating documents were found, but that ``more documents need
to be searched for and examined.'' He did not elaborate.
   Just before the March 18 election, politician Wolfgang Schnur
admitted former ties to the secret police and resigned as head of
Democratic Awakening, part of the alliance that won the balloting.
   The new Parliament is to convene for the first time Thursday,
but it is unlikely a governing coalition will be formed before
then. De Maiziere is trying to build a voting bloc that would give
him two-thirds control in Parliament.
   De Maiziere is likely to be East Germany's new premier and is a
close ally of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Manfred Stolpe, administrator of East Berlin's Lutheran Church,
last week examined secret police files kept on de Maiziere and
reported he saw nothing incriminating.
   Richard Schroeder, head of the Social Democrats' parliamentary
delegation, recommended that every new lawmaker be required to fill
out a questionnaire detailing their contact with the Stasi.
   The vast network of agents, informants and people who simply
gave information under intense pressure gave force to the regime of
Erich Honecker, who was ousted last year in East Germany's peaceful
pro-democracy revolt.
   Any activity deemed suspicious often resulted in the creation of
a secret file with detailed documentation of even an individual's
most innocuous activities. The system created a sense of paranoia
among the populace that still exists to a large extent.
   As recently as a few months ago, the Boehme-led Social Democrats
were considered heavy favorites to win the East German elections,
and Boehme the likely premier.
   But the Christian Democrats, promising fast reunification as a
quick path to Western prosperity, surged to a lopsided win.
   The Social Democrats favor a more gradual approach to
unification and emphasize environmental and social concerns.
   Boehme was a Communist Party member for 17 years but had
numerous disagreements with the government in the 1960s and 1970s,
and was forced to resign from jobs as a school teacher and head of
a local cultural society.
   He quit the party in 1976 and became an active member of an
illegal Social Democrat discussion group.

   The United States on Monday urged the African
National Congress to ``reaffirm its commitment to peace and
negotiations'' and reschedule talks with South Africa's white
minority government.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, noting that the
ANC canceled talks set for April 11 as a protest against police
shootings of black demonstrators, said some encouragement can be
drawn from the fact that black leader Nelson Mandela will meet this
week with South African President F.W. De Klerk.
   But she also expressed disappointment that the peace rally
Mandela had planned with followers of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha
Buthelezi in violence-plagued Natal province also has been
postponed at the urging of ANC activists.
   ``Mr. Mandela will visit the area of the fighting in Natal today
and tomorrow, and we have heard there is a possibility that he
might meet privately with Chief Buthelezi during that time,'' she
said.
   ``The April 11 meeting would have been an important next step on
the road to negotiations,'' she said. ``The joint rally would have
allowed the two chief elements of the opposition in Natal to begin
working together to end the violence there.
   ``We encourage the ANC to reaffirm its commitment to peace and
negotiations, and the best way to end the violence is through
dialogue.''

<HEAD>Cigarette Use in U.S. Takes Biggest Drop In Six Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette use in the United States dropped 5
percent last year, the largest decline in six years, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Overall, American smokers consumed about 533 billion cigarettes
in 1989, the department's Economic Research Service said in a
report. Exports, however, jumped 20 percent to 142 billion
cigarettes.
   Annual use by the U.S. adult population dropped 7 percent to
2,888 cigarettes, the report said. Economist Verner Grise said that
was the lowest average since 1942 when the average was 2,585
cigarettes per adult.
   The peak was 4,345 cigarettes in 1963, before beginning its
long-time decline.
   The average is for all Americans 18 years and older, smokers and
non-smokers alike. It is a statistical comparsison only and does
not indicate the actual smoking habits of the population.
   ``Domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fall
this year because of higher prices, increased restrictions on where
people can smoke, antismoking activity and declining social
acceptance of smoking,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The brother of Romania's late dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu went on trial Monday accused of killing seven
people during last December's bloody revolution that ended more
than 40 years of Communist rule.
   Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, 66, a former deputy interior minister
and police general, is charged with ``aggravated murder,''
instigation to commit genocide, and attempted murder, for his part
in efforts to suppress the popular revolt that ended his brother's
24-year hold on power.
   Under Romanian law ``aggravated murder'' is the slaying of more
than one person.
   According to the indictment, the defendant ordered some 1,000
police cadets under his command to fire on thousands of
demonstrators in the streets of Bucharest on Dec. 21-22. When they
refused, he allegedly shot seven protesters.
   Ceausescu has denied the accusations but has admitted the lesser
charge of illegal possession of firearms, the indictment said.
   The trial, which was expected to last through the week, took
place in a converted theater hall ringed with policemen and
soldiers in full combat gear. Two armored personnel carriers
blocked the entrance.
   The defendant sat flanked by two helmeted policemen and gazed
impassively at a three-man panel of military judges headed by Col.
Igon Dima. Ceausescu bears an eerie physical resemblance to his
late brother.
   He occasionally turned to glance at the courtroom, where access
was restricted to journalists and members of the victims' families.
   The 15-page indictment accused Ceausescu of ``issuing orders to
his men to open fire on demonstrators.'' It said he personally
``distributed ammunition to the cadets.''
   The document quoted witnesses among the security forces who
testified that ``he was shouting like a beast and shot his gun'' at
the crowds.
   ``He acted to suppress the revolution and fired his gun, killing
seven persons,'' the indictment said.
   At one point during the trial, the parents of one of the alleged
victims, tears streaming from their eyes, accused defense attorney
Vasile Soroceanu of ``protecting this hyena.''
   But Ceausescu told the court he did nt initiate orders to fire
on the deomnstrators. ``I did not give any orders on my own
initiative to repress the demonstrators, but I passed on through my
aides the orders I received from the minister of interior.''
   Soroceanu told the court the prosecution ``arbitrarily chose
seven victims from the hundreds who died without any proof that
(Andruta) Ceausescu had killed them.''
   Hundreds of people were killed in the popular uprising that
started in mid-December.
   Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled Dec. 22 and executed three days
later with his wife, Elena, after a summary trial before a military
tribunal.
   Following their execution, the death sentence was abolished by
the provisional leadership that took power in the chaos of the
revolution.
   If found guilty, the maximum penalty Ceausescu can face is life
imprisonment.
   Four of the former president's closest aides were sentenced to
life imprisonment by a military tribunal last month. His two sons
and daughter are also in custody awaiting trial, likely to open in
late April or early May, Romanian reporters said.

<HEAD>Revolutionaries: We Attacked U.S. Troops to Fight `Imperialism'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist group Monday said it was
fighting ``imperialism in Central America'' when it ambushed a bus
carrying 28 U.S. servicemen and wounded eight of them.
   The Honduran military chief, Gen. Arnulfo Cantero Lopez, has
said a nationwide manhunt is under way for the snipers who opened
fire Saturday with machine guns on a bus carrying 28 U.S. airmen
back from a trip to the beach. Two of the eight were in critical
condition with head and body wounds.
   The Morazano National Liberation Front has claimed
responsibility for the daylight attack outside Tegucigalpa, and the
U.S. Embassy said that claim is given credence.
   In the Front's statement published Monday in the daily newspaper
El Tiempo, it declared, ``We condemn with all our revolutionary
force the Central American occupation by the Yankee empire, which
has shed the blood of our people from Panama to Guatemala.
   ``With this action, taken by patriotic Morazan commandos against
the occupying troops, we remind our people and the people of the
world that we continue to fight against everyone who despoils our
fatherland.
   ``The fight against imperialism in Central America has more
validity today than in the past.''
   The Front is thought to be an arm of the Communist Party founded
in 1979, but U.S. officials say little else is known about the
group.
   ``It's a small radical group that has shown itself prone to
carry out terrorist atacks on U.S. military in Honduras,'' Embassy
spokesman Terrence Kneebone said.
   The United States keeps about 1,200 troops in Honduras on a
year-round basis, mostly at Soto Cano Air Base in central Honduras.
Additional soldiers are frequently brought in for joint exercises
with the Honduran military.
   A witness to Saturday's attack near Tegucigalpa said there were
three snipers on a ridge about 50 feet up, Kneebone said. A handful
of .45 caliber slugs found at the scene indicates the snipers used
a Thompson submachine gun and a World War II-era M-3 grease gun,
both U.S.-made weapons, he said.
   The Front also claimed responsibility for the last major attack
on U.S. forces in Honduras, on July 13. That bombing injured seven
U.S. military policemen in La Ceiba, 200 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
   The Front has claimed several other attacks in past years.

<HEAD>Aspin Says Money Must Come from Big-Ticket Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may shift funds to military
personnel accounts only if the money comes from Star Wars, the B-2
bomber and other programs, the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said Monday.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who had blocked Bush's attempts to
transfer the money to avoid massive layoffs, said he was not
opposed to ``some relief for our men and women in uniform.''
   However, he added conditions for providing that relief,
including ``explicit assurances'' from the Bush administration that
the incident will not happen again and the requirement that the
source of the money will be several big-ticket weapons systems.
   ``It must be clearly established that military people are a
higher priority than hardware,'' Aspin said in a three-page letter
to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   He said the money must come from four of the ``favored weapons
programs,'' _ the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as
Star Wars; the B-2 bomber; SSN-21 attack submarine; and the Army's
light helicopter program.
   Aspin and several other members of Congress are scheduled to
meet Tuesday with Cheney on the issue.
   The controversy centers on the administration's request to
Congress earlier this year for the authority to transfer the funds
from several Pentagon accounts to military personnel.
   Bush had the option in August to exclude personnel from the
budget-cutting law, but decided against it. Pentagon officials
testified recently that they did not ask for the exemption on the
assumption that Congress would later give them the authority to
transfer the money.
   But four congressional committees are required to approve such a
shift in defense funds, and Aspin declined to bring the issue up in
his committee.
   ``I objected to your fiscal year 1990 reprogramming requests for
personnel because they represented an attempt to ease the pain of
Gramm-Rudman ... on the Pentagon, but nowhere else,'' Aspin said in
the letter. ``That was and is unacceptable.''
   Since Aspin's action, money from the Pentagon accounts that
would have served as the source for the transfer have been
earmarked for an aid package for Nicaragua and Panama.
   But Cheney is still pressing for the funds to avoid laying off
thousands of military men and women. Aspin proposes that the major
strategic weapons the administration has favored serve as the
source.
   ``Cuts from these programs would restore the Gramm-Rudman bite
just where the administration's budget strategy sought to avoid
it,'' Aspin said. ``Taking money out of these four programs will
hurt, but that was the point ... in the first place.''
   Aspin also said the assurances that such an action will not
happen again must be made by both Cheney and White House budget
chief Richard Darman in public testimony before the House Armed
Services Committee.

<HEAD>Frenzel Won't Keep Campaign Treasury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., is retiring in
time to legally pocket the $360,000 in his campaign treasury, but
he said Monday that he'll give much of the money to other
candidates.
   House members elected before 1980 are allowed to convert
campaign funds to personal use on retirement if they leave Congress
before Jan. 1, 1993.
   ``I've all along said that I didn't think that was a good way to
use funds,'' Frenzel said. ``I don't object to members taking some
modest amounts, but ... that isn't why those moneys were
solicited.''
   Critics say the perk has allowed House members with safe seats
to amass huge, unneeded campaign money they could put to personal
use when they retired.
   Frenzel, who had $358,347 in the bank Jan. 1, is one of 186
House members eligible to keep their campaign funds and one of 69
holding at least $250,000, according to a survey by Roll Call, a
semi-weekly Capitol Hill newspaper.
   Frenzel, who announced his retirement Friday, said he'll return
all the contributions he received for this year's election,
including the $53,366 he reported collecting in 1989 and everything
he has received this year.
   Much of the remaining money will be given to other candidates,
he said. Last year, his campaign gave $1,000 each to six House or
Senate candidates.
   Frenzel's campaign committee will decide how to dispose of the
rest of the money, he said.
   ``If they want to buy me a goodbye dinner I'm not going to
complain about that,'' Frenzel said. ``I'm not running for Mexico
with a big wad of my campaign money.''

<TEXT>
   A man who donated one of his kidneys to save his
mother's life seven years ago died hours before she could repay him
with a bone marrow transplant to help him overcome leukemia,
authorities said Monday.
   ``I'm really heartbroken,'' Ernestine Mitchell said. ``If only
he could have lasted eight more hours.''
   Her 37-year-old son, Hilliary, had been unable to work as a
truck driver since contracting leukemia, and was to receive the
bone marrow transplant during a day-long operation beginning at
7:30 a.m. He died of an infection shortly before midnight Sunday,
said John Easton, spokesman for the University of Chicago Hospitals.
   Mitchell died from ``an overwhelming infection related to the
leukemia and the loss of his immune system,'' Easton said. ``High
doses of chemotherapy needed to combat the disease and prepare the
patient for the transplant can leave the patient without a
functioning immune system.''
   Mrs. Mitchell said she and other family members were at her
son's bedside Sunday and had expected him to hang on for the
potentially life-saving procedure.
   ``It's a hurting thing, but I have to remain strong because he
was strong at the end,'' Mrs. Mitchell said. ``He talked to us and
was kissing us all and we thought he was getting better. We were
waiting for 7:30 to come.''
   Mrs. Mitchell said she was convinced her bone marrow would have
helped.
   ``I carried him for nine months, his body was a part of my body.
Then he gave me his kidney,'' she said. ``I know that if he had
gotten the marrow everything would have been OK. Being a mother, I
think it would have.''
   Mitchell himself knew that his odds were not good because his
disease was already at an advanced stage and he had been
hospitalized before because of other infections, Easton said.
   Leukemia is a form of cancer in which abnormal cells can spread
in the bone marrow, preventing it from making normal blood cells.
This leaves the patient highly susceptible to serious infections,
anemia and bleeding. A transplant replaces the patient's defective
marrow with healthy marrow.
   Easton said the mother's bone marrow removal operation had been
scheduled for this morning, with the transplant to be done in the
afternoon. The operation was filled with risks, and the odds of
Mitchell's recovery were 25 percent to 40 percent, he said.
   Mitchell had been mentally prepared, said Dr. Robert Geller, who
was to have performed the transplant. ``When you've got no options,
you go with what you've got,'' Geller said.
   Mitchell already had won one battle in getting the money for the
$150,000 transplant from the state Medicaid program after Gov.
James R. Thompson stepped in and reversed a decision denying funds
for the operation.
   ``Getting the money was the hard part,'' Mitchell said as he
entered the hospital March 23. ``I'm a survivor. I've walked in
here and I'm going to walk out again, well.''
   Geller, a bone cancer specialist, said Mitchell had been under
intensive chemotherapy for the past 10 days. Those drugs and the
anti-rejection drugs Mitchell would have received are highly toxic,
``and the kidney is the most important organ in handling that
toxicity.''
   He said Mitchell's leukemia was in an aggressive phase and that
his mother was not an ideal donor. Perfect bone marrow tissue comes
from a brother or sister with an identical tissue match, Geller
said.
   But Geller said tissue match between mother and son had been
good enough in the kidney operation. Mrs. Mitchell had been dying
of polycystic kidney disease.
   Her son's act in donating his kidney ``is more dear to me now
than ever,'' Mrs. Mitchell said. ``I have an everlasting part of
him, my perpetual Mother's Day gift.''

<HEAD>HUD Gives Low-Income Tenants Waivers to Permit Census Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-income residents of federally subsidized
housing may accept temporary jobs as 1990 census takers without
facing possible rent increases because of the additional income,
the government said Monday.
   Jack Kemp, secretary of the department of Housing and Urban
Development, said he signed the waiver because it ``will help
residents of rent subsidized housing earn extra income and will
also help the Census Bureau secure a more accurate account of the
number of low-income, rent-subsidized Americans.''
   The Census Bureau hires the temporary workers to canvass homes
in which residents did not return the 1990 census form received in
the mail. The temporary jobs pay up to $8 an hour.
   HUD and Census Bureau officials said hiring residents of
subsidized housing complexes to canvass their neighbors should help
provide a more accurate count. The formulas for several HUD grant
programs are based on census information.
   Low-income residents who receive rent subsidies generally pay a
percentage of their income for rent. The waiver signed by Kemp
would exempt any income from the Census Bureau temporary jobs from
the rent calculation.

   The trial, which has been in recess since the jury was sworn in

<HEAD>Bulgarian Communist Party Reported About to Change Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party will change its name
on Tuesday and that of its newspaper, informed sources said. The
change will coincide with the beginning of a more realistic dollar
exchange rate.
   The state news agency BTA said Bulgarians traveling abroad will
have to pay up to four times as much for U.S. dollars or other
convertible currencies, but no other details were given.
   Vladimir Vladimirov, director general of the National Bank,
announced that the new rate for one dollar will be 9.60 leva for
those seeking to buy dollars. Those wishing to sell dollars to the
government can do so at a rate of 9.69.
   But BTA later said the new rate would be a floating exchange
rate governed by supply and demand.
   The agency also reported that while final results of a
membership referendum were not available, most favor the Communist
Party being renamed the Bulgarian Socialist Party.
   Sources, speaking to The AP on condition of anonymity, said a
decision to that effect is to be announced after a session Tuesday
of the party's Supreme Council, successor to the longtime
policy-setting Central Committee. The sources also said the party
newspaper would be renamed but did not elaborate.
   Last week, however, a small, independent party challenged the
forthcoming decision, saying it already had the same name _ the
Socialist Party.
   A crane meanwhile lifted the huge Rabotnichekso Delo (Workers'
Affairs) sign off the roof of the Communist Party newspaper
building in Sofia on Monday.
   The newspaper, with a daily circulation of 800,000, from now on
will be published under the name Duma (Word), BTA said.
   BTA said the National Bank on Monday cut by more than half the
amount of freely convertible currency that can be purchased by
Bulgarians traveling abroad. They are now entitled to buy $30 worth
instead of $65.
   The previous dollar exchange rate was about 2.50, long
considered unrealistic. Informants said the new rate was designed
to curb a growing black market.
   The measure will make it even harder for Bulgarians to visit
Western countries, however.

<HEAD>100 British Policemen Mobilized to Hunt Suspects After Tax Riot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities on Monday mobilized 100 policemen to
track down suspects in a weekend anti-tax rally that erupted into a
riot and one of the worst outbreaks of violence in modern-day
London.
   The courts took a hard line with some of the 339 people already
arrested. At least 12 taken into custody during Saturday's six-hour
melee at Trafalgar Square were refused bail at five London courts.
   Most of the 68 people in court Monday were in their teens or 20s
and gave addresses in London ``squats'' _ illegal residences in
abandoned houses or apartments. The charges ranged from arson to
criminal damage and theft to threatening behavior.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said the riot over the
imposition of a new tax by the Thatcher government on every adult
caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage and injured 374
of the 2,198 police officers involved. Police said 86 civilians
were injured.
   Charges of blame for the violence meanwhile flew back and forth.
Authorities accused anarchists, who in turn blamed police. The
government partly blamed the opposition Labor Party, and a Labor
member accused the government of playing politics.
   Home Secretary David Waddington said 100 policemen were taking
part in a large-scale search for suspects headed by chief Det. Roy
Ramm.
   The detective appealed to the news media and public to provide
film and photographs of the riot to help police identify
troublemakers.
   Magistrates set bail for some suspects charged with public order
offenses. However, as a condition of bail, some were forbidden to
attend any more anti-tax demonstrations, while others were barred
from coming within one mile of Trafalgar Square.
   The violence broke out after a peaceful demonstration by about
40,000 people. Police were attacked, automobiles burned and
overturned, shop windows smashed and shops looted.
   The demonstrators were protesting a new tax called the community
charge, which is levied on every adult to finance local government
services across the country. The old tax was levied on property
owners.
   Many households will be paying up to one-third more, while
millions of people will be paying the tax for the first time.
   Demonstrations against the tax have broken out across Britain,
and the levy has been blamed for contributing to drop in popularity
for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.
   The Yard said anarchists in a group called Class War were
prominent in starting trouble.
   However, Andy Murphy, a leader of the group, said: ``The police
were attacked and quite rightly so.'' In comments to BBC radio, she
called the rioters who battled police ``working-class heroes.''
   The demonstration organizers, the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax
Federation, blamed a small group of troublemakers but also accused
police of losing control.
   In a noisy House of Commons debate, Waddington denied the
demonstration had not been sufficiently policed.
   ``What happened on this occasion was that it was not just a few,
but 3,000 or so members of our society behaved in a most
disgraceful, criminal and uncivilized fashion,'' said Waddington,
the Cabinet minister for law and order.
   The police showed courage and restraint in dealing with ``some
of the most ferocious violence we have ever seen on the streets of
London,'' he said.
   Both opposition and Conservative government politicians
condemned the violence. However, Waddington said part of the blame
had to be shouldered by the opposition Labor Party, because 30 of
its members had urged citizens not to pay the poll tax.
   ``Do they really expect the people they seek to influence to
stop just trying to break the tax _ and not in fact encourage them
to break policemen's heads?'' Waddington said.
   Labor Party lawmaker Peter Mandelson called Waddington's attack
``mindless mudslinging.'' He said the minister was trying to score
political points.

   ``We need leaders who serve for the public good, not personal
gratification,'' Turner said. ``We need leaders who surround

   Turner, a policeman for 32 years and chief for the last eight,
said that improving the school system and fighting drugs and crime
would be the top priorities of his administration.
   He offered few specific proposals but promised to listen to the
complaints and suggestions of citizens.
   Turner, 54, switched to the Republican Party last July, fueling
speculation that he intended to run for mayor. He is the only
Republican in the race and is making his first run for public
office.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans about nine to one in the
nation's capital.
   The former chief and Mayor Marion Barry clashed publicly over
police staffing levels during Turner's final months in office.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebels, Ethiopians Meet in Yemen for Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN'A, North Yemen (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopian officials met with four of
the five major Eritrean rebel groups on Monday for peace talks
aimed at ending Africa's longest civil war.
   While the main guerrilla faction did not attend the meeting in
this North Yemenese capital, officials hope the talks will develop
into an overall peace conference involving all factions.
   At the opening meeting Sunday night at the North Yemen Foreign
Ministry in San'a, both sides stressed their desire to end the
guerrilla war with a lasting political settlement. They then went
into closed session.
   Shewandani Yalta, a member of the Politburo of Ethiopia's ruling
Labor Party, led a 14-member delegation to the talks sponsored by
North Yemen, a country facing Ethiopian on the other side of the
Red Sea.
   In attendance were rebel leaders from the Eritrean Liberation
Front, the ELF-Revolutionary Council, the ELF-National Council and
the ELF-Unified Organization.
   The Moslem-dominated groups claim to represent half the
disparate rebel forces fighting for autonomy for Ethiopia's
northern province since 1962.
   Former President Jimmy Carter arranged talks between the leading
Eritrean Popular Liberation Front and Ethiopian authorities in
Atlanta last year and then this year in Nairobi, Kenya.
   The Front, which was not attending the talks in North Yemen,
launched a new offensive in February and recently captured the port
of Mussawa.
   No one at the new talks has pointed to any basis for an
agreement, although there is a U.N. resolution calling for Eritrean
self-rule.
   An Eritrean source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``The main thing is to decide whether to continue negotiations or
not, and then possible solutions will be laid out.''
   The San'a meeting is the second between the four smaller
Eritrean groups and the Ethiopians. The first, mediated by the East
African neighbor Sudan, was held in Khartoum in March and April
1989.

   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater entered
a New York hospital Monday for intense radiation treatment of a
type of brain tumor that experts say is persistent and dangerous.
   Mary Matalin, chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee, said in a statement that doctors had determined Atwater
has an astrocytoma, a type of tumor that has ``the potential to
behave aggressively.''
   The tumor was diagnosed last month after Atwater collapsed
during a speech.
   Dr. Stuart Grossman, director of neurological onocology at the
Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore, said astrocytomas ``are
tough tumors to cure. They do have a tendency to come back.''
   Astrocytomas are graded I through IV, although grade IV is
usually called by another name. The announcement did not identify
the grade of Atwater's tumor.
   ``All of these types of tumors are potentially curable and
potentially fatal,'' said Dr. R. William Harter, an associate
professor of radiation onocology at Georgetown Unversity Hospital.
   He said for a grade I astrocytoma the five-year survival rate is
about 50 percent when treated aggressively. For grade II, he said,
the five-year survival rate is 25 percent, and for grade III it is
10 percent to 20 percent.
   Grade IV, more commonly called glioblastoma multiforme or
anaplastic astrocytoma, are always fatal, Harter said.
   Grossman cautioned that ``a five year survival does not equal
cure.''
   ``These types of tumors usually come back,'' he said.
   Another physician, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
patients with astrocytomas ``run a substantial risk of dying from
this disease at some point.''
   One source familiar with the case said doctors found cells
within the tumor that had the potential for sudden growth. The
source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said there had
been no growth in the tumor diagnosed March 6.
   Atwater, 39, checked into New York City's Montefiore Medical
Center, where doctors planned to insert radioactive isotopes into
the tumor on the right side of his brain. After the procedure, done
under local anesthesia, the isotopes remain implanted for five days.
   The treatment is under the direction of Dr. Paul L. Kornblith,
chairman of neurological surgery at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine.
   ``Mr. Atwater's age and excellent physical condition, together
with the early diagnosis of the tumor, its size and location, offer
favorable circumstances for successful results,'' Kornblith said.
   ``The treatment provides a higher dose of radiation targeted on
the tumor over a shorter time period,'' Matalin said.
   The RNC announcement said Atwater's tumor is in the frontal
lobe. Both Harter and Grossman said the frontal lobe is more easily
treated without the risk of loss of function than are most other
areas of the brain.
   Harter said patients receiving radioactive isotope treatment
directly on brain tumors seldom suffer acute side effects and most
are able to work while the treatment is under way.
   Every two to three months after receiving such therapy, patients
are re-examined, with X-ray or magnetic images taken to determine
if the tumor is growing.
   ``You can have a problem on down the line in that the area
exposed to the radiation may shrivel up,'' Grossman said. ``The
brain doesn't handle such dead tissue very well, so you have to go
in and clear it (of dead cells.)''
   In Cincinnati, President Bush said he wished Atwater his best.
   ``Right now, there's nothing more important for Lee to do than
get well, and I know that's exactly what he intends to do given
that fighting spirit,'' Bush said while campaigning for George
Voinovich, the GOP gubernatorial candidate in Ohio.
   After Atwater was first hospitalized, doctors said the tumor was
non-malignant and would be treated with daily radiation therapy
over a five-week period.
   ``The doctors are sticking by the original thing, that it's
small and it's very treatable,'' said Charles Black, a political
consultant who is a close friend and former business partner of
Atwater.
   ``What he did was seek out the most aggressive kind of radiation
treatment you can get,'' Black said. ``What these guys are going to
do is in a week give him more radiation than he would get over the
whole five weeks with the program he was on.''

   Soggy commuters walked, bicycled and joined
in carpools to get to work Monday and half of Buffalo's high school
students were absent from classes because of the city's bus and
subway system shutdown.
   ``I just don't understand this at all,'' said Sheila Addison,
who walked three miles through drizzle and fog to her job at a
downtown bank.
   A chance at reviving some transit service in time for Monday
evening's rush hour fell through when commissioners of the Niagara
Frontier Transportation Authority balked at a financial rescue plan
that would have eliminated all weekend service and 125 of the
system's 600 bus drivers.
   The commissioners agreed to delay taking a formal vote on the
plan after Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski told them aides to
Gov. Mario Cuomo were willing to consider contributing additional
state money.
   A Cuomo spokeswoman later said she knew nothing about that
possibility, and the commissioners went home after deciding no
immediate help would be forthcoming from the state.
   Bus and subway service for 120,000 daily riders ended early
Sunday when the transit agency ran out of cash. The shutdown of a
six-mile subway line and 1,015 miles of bus routes came three days
after the County Legislature rejected a proposed tax on utilities
to raise $9 million for transit.
   The system costs $55 million a year to run and depends on a
combination of farebox revenues and grants from the county, state
and federal governments. It barely avoided a deficit in the fiscal
year that ended Friday and faced a $15.6 million gap in the new
fiscal year budget.
   The shutdown left 11,000 public high school students without a
ride to school. Attendance was as low as 40 percent at some high
schools, said school spokeswoman Kathy Shriver. She said no
decision had been made about whether to penalize students for their
absences.
   Buffalo Teachers Federation president Philip Rumore said the
union would wait for the transit agency to vote on the bailout plan
before asking a federal judge to order service to be restored. The
union says the shutdown has illegally disrupted the city's
desegregation plan.
   Public and private schools in New York's second-largest city
remained open and Buffalo's 25,000 elementary students rode
privately contracted buses as usual.
   Commuters fared better than the students, but nearly everyone
had a story to tell.
   ``My sister-in-law has this old junky piece of car and said we
could use it if we could find out what's wrong with it,'' said
Tequita Craig, a nurse's aide. ``We dished out $70 for a new
battery.''
   Police Capt. John O'Keefe said traffic density was near normal,
but a lot of motorists appeared to have joined carpools.
   ``Where you'd usually have one guy in a car or two guys, today
there were six guys,'' O'Keefe said.
   Others braved the chilly, damp weather to get to their jobs.
   ``Everybody was walking together with sneakers on. Can you
believe it?'' said a woman named Tennizee High, who walked 1{ hours
to her downtown job.
   County and transit officials met all night to devise a new
fiscal plan for the transit system.
   County officials agreed to raise real estate transfer taxes and,
starting next year, to allocate a portion of sales tax revenue to
transit. The transit agency agreed to raise fares from $1 to $1.10,
raise transfers from 5 cents to 20 cents and make $2.5 million in
budget cuts.
   The deal collapsed when transit officials, rechecking their
figures, discovered they had been using the wrong fiscal year in
their calculations and that $3.7 million in budget cuts would be
necessary.

   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to let
California carry out its first execution in 23 years, letting stand
an order that blocks a murderer's Tuesday trip to the state gas
chamber.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court rejected an emergency request from
state authorities who wanted to execute Robert Alton Harris on
schedule.
   A federal appeals court judge Friday had ordered the execution
postponed, ruling that more study of Harris' mental condition may
be needed.
   Judge John Noonan of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said Harris should be kept alive until a
three-judge appeals court panel studies whether his lawyers or the
psychatrists they hired were incompetent in failing to have him
tested for brain damage and other serious mental disorders.
   Harris was convicted of killing two San Diego boys in 1978. The
nation's highest court had ruled against him four times previously.
   California Attorney General John Van De Kamp sought to have
Noonan's order set aside, and his emergency request was submitted
to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. She referred it to the full Supreme
Court.
   The court voted to deny the state's request.
   Its brief order read: ``The application of the attorney general
of California to vacate the (appeals court) order, dated March 30,
1990, staying the execution of sentence of death, presented to
Justice O'Connor and by her referred to the court is denied.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to set aside the stay of execution and
let Harris die.

   Nelson Mandela stood on a muddy
hilltop Monday in Natal province's ``Valley of Death'' and pleaded
for peace, while members of warring Zulu factions glared at each
other from opposite ridges.
   ``This violence must end,'' said Mandela, vice president of the
anti-apartheid African National Congress. He was speaking to about
200 ANC supporters in Imbali, a township where rival blacks have
battled since 1983.
   The main combatants are ANC supporters and backers of the
Inkatha party, which is headed by Zulu homeland leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   Since heavy fighting began in 1986, more than 4,000 blacks have
died in southeastern Natal Province. The battles have intensified
the past week, with at least 53 injured, hundreds injured and
thousands made homeless.
   When the sun sets after soaking autumn rains on the grassy hills
of Edendale Valley, the night brings the sound of gunshots, screams
and the explosion of gasoline bombs.
   The sun rises through the morning mists to reveal bodies lying
in the streets and fields, houses aflame, and women and children
hurrying along the roads carrying their hastily wrapped belongings.
   Mandela went to the heart of what has been dubbed the ``Valley
of Death'' with two messages: that he and other ANC leaders cared
what was happening, and that the enemy is not fellow Zulus.
   ``We are not fighting Inkatha. We are fighting apartheid and the
forces of oppression,'' he told a crowd of 2,000 earlier in the day
in Edendale. They shoved into a church hall to hear him, then
stampeded out to chase and cheer his car along the wet dirt road.
   Later, he repeated the message in nearby Imbali, where local
residents said four men died the night before in fighting.
   Hundreds of ANC supporters lined the ridges of the hills around
the township to glimpse Mandela's motorcade on the opposite hill.
   They said they were afraid to pass through the section of town
controlled by the rival Inkatha group to hear Mandela's speech. As
he talked to the few hundred who tramped across muddy fields to see
him, the crowd stirred, mumbled and pointed to Inkatha men on an
opposite hill.
   Mandela repeated his desire to meet with Buthelezi, an old
friend despite their political differences. He had suggested
holding a joint peace rally Monday with the Inkatha leader, but
Natal ANC leaders and other anti-apartheid figures persuaded him to
cancel Friday.
   Their view seemed to predominate in the non-Inkatha sections of
Imbali, where young men in the streets said a Mandela-Buthelezi
meeting would change nothing, and a joint peace rally would be
dangerous.
   ``I think he thought it would stop the war,'' 20-year-old
Sibusiso Peters said of Mandela's desire for a peace meeting. ``But
I think we know better.''

   A Vietnamese refugee hacked to death a
countryman in a camp for boat people Monday night, police said.
   It was the latest report of violence in the overcrowded, squalid
camps of this British colony. Many fights have broken out in past
months, but with few casualties.
   Details on the death Monday were sketchy, and police said only
that the victim was 33 years old. They said no arrests were made.
   The deaths occurred in an open camp, where refugees are allowed
to come and go.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese boat people are languishing in camps
throughout the territory. Those in detention camps, without freedom
of movement, are being screened to determine if they qualify for
resettlement. Otherwise, Hong Kong has vowed to send them back to
Vietnam.

   A court sentenced a Yugoslav immigrant to three
years in jail Monday for supplying classified information to the
PLO, Israel radio said.
   It said Victoria David, 34, pleaded guilty in exchange for
dropping more serious charges of spying. She was also given a
three-year suspended sentence.
   Ms. David came to Israel about two years ago after converting to
Judaism in Yugoslavia. She was given new immigrant status under the
Law of Return, which automatically grants citizenship to any Jew
who wants to live here.
   Israel radio said she tried to kill herself in prison and told
Haifa District court in northern Israel before being sentenced that
she regretted the entire incident.
   Ms. David was arrested on Jan. 7 with another Yugoslav woman,
Patricia Kansevitz, 26, on suspicion of photographing military
installations and sending the pictures to an activist of the
Palestine Liberation Organization in Yugoslavia.
   Ms. Kansevitz, a Christian who came on a tourist visa, was
deported in March.
   Also Monday, Jerusalem police and the General Security Service
said they broke a Palestinian guerrilla cell that operated in the
Jerusalem area the past two years.
   Eight Palestinians were held on suspicion of attacking Israelis
and Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel, police
spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   He said the group was suspected of killing Palestinian Ibrahim
Sawan as a collaborator in March and of bomb attacks in Jerusalem
and Jewish settlements.
   At least one Israeli was seriously injured in one bombing,
Sandori said.
   Israel television said police found a cache of weapons and
explosives.

<HEAD>Greek Party Leader Accuses Papandreou of Backing Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative leader Monday accused
former Premier Andreas Papandreou of backing organized violence in
the campaign for April 8 elections.
   Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the New Democracy party, made
the accusation the day after shots from a passing car killed a
Socialist supporter and injured four people in Iraklion on the
island of Crete. Mitsotakis' party says one of the injured was a
New Democracy backer.
   ``Andreas Papandreou and his supporters are trying with all
legitimate and illegitimate means _ even violence _ to block the
rise of New Democracy to power,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   ``Yesterday's violence on Crete was part of a carefully worked
out plan,'' said Mitsotakis.
   Papandreou, leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement,
described Mitsotakis' statements as `inflammatory'' and ``morally
unacceptable'' in televized remarks from his home.
   Sunday's violence broke out after Socialist supporters set up
barricades to stop conservatives from approaching Iraklion's
center, where Mitsotakis was scheduled to address a campaign rally.
   Papandreou said the dead man and one of the four wounded were
party members.
   New Democracy said Crete journalist Costas Papageorgiou, 40,
shot in the chest and listed in serious condition, is a party
cadre. Papageorgiou works for the newspaper Kastrina Nea of
Iraklion.
   Mitsotakis said that, at his request, Premier Xenophon Zolotas
had earlier asked Papandreou to order his supporters to dismantle
the roadblocks, but the Socialist leader refused.
   ``Papandreou did nothing because he wanted acrimony, and he
wanted to provoke the incidents,'' Mitsotakis said.
   ``This is not the first time New Democracy is the victim of
terrorist acts. They are trying to intimidate us, terrorize us and
even murder us,'' he said.
   Mitsotakis' son-in-law, conservative member of parliament Pavlos
Bakoyannis, was shot to death by the November 17 urban terrorist
group in September.
   Mitsotakis himself was the target of an attack before national
elections in November. A Greek Air Force warrant officer was killed
as he attempted to plant a time bomb in a theater on the island of
Lesbos, where Mitsotakis was due to speak later the same day.
   Greeks have already voted in two inconclusive elections since
June.

<HEAD>US To Drop Export Licenses For Computer Disk-Drives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department moved on Monday to
free exports of hard-disk drives for personal computers.
   Last year U.S. sales to other countries were worth about $500
million, the department said, despite licensing requirements
imposed to keep them out of the Soviet Union and its allies.
Dropping the curbs is expected to lead to a large increase in sales.
   On Wednesday the licensing restrictions will be removed for
sales of disks with a capacity of 45 megabytes to almost all
countries outside the Soviet Union and its allies. One megabyte
holds roughly a million characters.
   ``The net result of this decontrol will be to focus and maintain
export restrictions on those items that are truly strategic and can
be controlled effectively,'' said Dennis E. Kloske, undersecretary
of commerce for export control, in a statement.
   The department has decided the hard-disk drives can be bought
freely from other countries, so there is no reason to prevent
American companies from competing for the business.
   For sales to the Soviets and its East European allies, the
Commerce Department is submitting a proposal to the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) in Paris. This
group includes the member countries of NATO, except for Iceland,
plus Japan and Australia.
   Until COCOM rules, the Commerce Department will continue to
require export licenses for shipments to eastern Europe countries,
it said.
   If COCOM agrees, as it is expected to do within a few months,
U.S. disk drives will be available for sale anywhere in the world,
except to Libya, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, Cambodia and the
police and armed forces of South Africa.
   Last Friday the Defense Department announced that it had decided
to drop out of export licensing for what it called ``minimal
security risk'' items and leave decisions on those to the Commerce
Department.
   These items included some computers, medical equipment and
industrial items including machine tools and telecommunications
equipment. Pentagon officials will continue to look at requests to
export super-computers.
   Business people have complained for years that review by the two
departments cause export delays and complications.

   Pittsburgh braced for a long-term water crisis
Monday as a slow-moving fuel spill snaked down the Allegheny River,
threatening supplies to as many as 1 million people.
   ``I think it's very possible the worst of this is yet to come,''
said the city's public safety director, Glenn Cannon. ``There's no
end to it.''
   A hospital served meals on paper plates, supermarkets sold out
of bottled water, schools closed and a steel plant trucked in water
to flush its toilets.
   A landslide late Friday severed an underground 10-inch-wide
pipeline near Freeport, 35 miles north of Pittsburgh. The pipe
spilled between 75,000 and 300,000 gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel
and kerosene into the river.
   Like tumbling dominoes, water companies along the Allegheny were
forced to close the intakes of their water treatment plants one by
one as the 20-mile-long spill oozed toward Pittsburgh, reaching the
city early Monday evening. Some were able to reopen Monday as the
spill became more diluted and the water could be treated with
filters.
   The Pittsburgh Water Department, which serves 450,000 people,
still was drawing water from the river and boosting its reservoirs
Monday afternoon but was preparing to close its intakes at any
moment.
   If the spill ``should move suddenly, we'll have to shut the
plant,'' said Mayor Sophie Masloff.
   Pittsburgh gets only part of its water from the Allegheny, and
had enough reserves to last three to five days, said Cannon. ``The
long-term impact could be devastating,'' he said.
   Up to 20,000 residents served by the Harrison Township Water
Authority have been without water since Saturday and depended on
National Guard portable water tanks set up to provide drinking and
cooking water.
   Orders to conserve water were issued to at least 400,000 other
people served by various other water authorities northeast of
Pittsburgh.
   At least nine school districts closed Monday, idling more than
21,000 students, and many businesses were affected by the spill.
   State emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a
45,000-gallon reservoir at Allegheny Valley Hospital, which draws
its water from the river. The hospital used paper plates and cups
to serve meals to its 225 patients, closed its laundry and was
sending dirty linens to another hospital.
   Drinking water was trucked in for the 2,600 employees of the
Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. specialty steel plant in nearby
Brackenridge, and some was used to flush toilets, said company
spokesman Bert Delano.
   At Marshall's Amoco station in Natrona Heights about 30 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, the taps and the car wash went dry Sunday
afternoon, said attendant Laurie Maycock.
   ``Nothing happens when you turn the tap on,'' she said. ``But
it's not so bad. It's raining, so no one wants to wash their car
anyway.''
   Like many supermarkets in the area, the Shop'N Save in Natrona
Heights quickly sold out of 150 cases of bottled water Monday
morning.
   ``That's the thing about water,'' said manager Bill Rossey.
``You don't miss it until it's gone.''
   The thick, gel-like spill, estimated to be 5 to 21 feet deep,
moved almost imperceptibly at times. At its fastest, it moved half
a mile an hour.
   ``It's almost as if it stops and takes a rest somewhere,'' said
John Kaus of the Allegheny County Emergency Management Agency.
   Booms stretched across the river were having little effect, and
recovered less than 10,000 gallons because most of the fuel was
well below the surface, Kaus said.
   About 100 workers from Buckeye Pipeline Co. and two contractors
worked Monday to clean up the leak, said Roy Haase Jr. of Buckeye
Pipeline. Below the source of the leak, crews built a dam on Knapp
Run Creek to collect fuel flowing from the oil-soaked soil.
   The landslide prevented workers from reaching the broken
pipeline, but the danger of an explosion has been minimized by rain
and wind, Haase said.
   Officials said some fish and other aquatic life were killed, but
said it was too early to determine the extent of environmental
damage.

   Bombs rocked two ministries and the

   A police spokesman said the 2:20 a.m. explosions ripped through

Unions.
   The officer said an anonymous caller to a newspaper claimed the
Popular Armed Struggle urban guerrilla group had planted the bombs.
The group has called for voters to boycott Sunday's national
elections.
   The group has been involved in bombing targets of a mainly
economic nature since 1974 but none of its attacks have ever caused

Front, or FMLN, will be Cmdr. Shafik Handal, general commander;
Salvador Samayoa and commanders Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Roberto
Canas of the political diplomatic commission.
   U.N. officials said the secretary-general will hold separate
meetings and a joint meeting Wednesday. How long the meetings would
go on was not uncertain, and the agenda was not disclosed.
   Alvara de Sota, the secretary-general's personal representative
for the Central American peace process, will take part and could
continue the talks after Perez de Cuellar leaves Thursday for
Athens, officials said.
   The conservative government of President Alfredo Cristiani and
leftist rebels already have met to discuss ending the insurgency.
Both sides accepted U.N. mediation, but this will be the first time
the secretary-general has met with both sides.
   The rebels have been fighting since 1979 to overthrow
U.S.-backed conservative governments.
   This marks the secretary-general's latest effort to bring
together two sides in a regional conflict. His other efforts
included Afghanistan, bringing Afghanistan and Pakistan together;
the Iran-Iraq war and Cyprus.
   U.N. officials said the Central American peace agreement, the
recent free elections in Nicaragua, and plans to disband Nicaraguan
rebels have created a positive atmosphere for resolving the El
Salvador conflict.
   Negotiations between government and rebels broke off last
November after a union headquarters was bombed and the guerrillas
launched an offensive in San Salvador, the capital. More than 1,000
people died in the fighting.

   A reputed Mafia assassin wanted for nine
years has been arrested in what authorities described Monday as one
of the biggest blows to the Sicilian underworld in years.
   Giuseppe Lucchese, 29, who was considered one of Italy's most
dangerous fugitives, was arrested Sunday as he left an apartment
building outside Palermo, authorities reported.
   Inside, police said they found a .38-caliber revolver, $16,000
in cash, a ski mask, fake identity papers and other documents.
   ``It's the most important police operation of the last few
years,'' said Giovanni Falcone, Italy's top anti-Mafia prosecutor.
   Police said Lucchese has been implicated in dozens of gang
murders, including the 1982 assassination of Gen. Carlo Alberto
Dalla Chiesa, who led the state's fight against the Mafia.
   One Mafioso-turned-state's witness, Marino Mannoia, has accused
Lucchese of involvement in 37 slayings.
   Lucchese has already been convicted in absentia and sentenced to
life imprisonment in a mass trial of Mafia figures.
   Investigators tracked him down by following his girlfriend,
Claudia Chines. She was also arrested and charged with aiding a
fugitive.

   President Bush needs a strategy to help new
democracies around the world before expecting Congress to approve
the $800 million he seeks for Panama and Nicaragua, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell said Monday.
   ``The administration is asking Congress to put together a jigsaw
puzzle without any overall picture and without all the pieces,''
Mitchell, D-Maine, said in a statement that called the White House
approach ``piecemeal.''
   The majority leader's comments appeared to place a further
complication in the way of quick passage of the aid money, which
Bush contends is necessary to bolster the new democratic
governments in the two Central American countries.
   House passage of the aid measure, which has ballooned to $2.4
billion with the addition by lawmakers of an array of domestic
spending, was expected to come on Tuesday with a minimum of
controversy.
   But no action had been scheduled in the Senate on the money
bill, which Bush had said he wanted to be enacted before Congress
leaves town Thursday for a 12-day Easter recess.
   Mitchell said he hoped to begin work in the Senate Wednesday on
a companion bill setting up aid programs for the two countries. But
that bill contains no money to fund the programs.
   ``By approaching foreign aid on a country-by-country basis and
in one-shot increments, the administration has provided no overall
or long-term view of how all the pieces can and should fit
together,'' Mitchell said.
   ``They have provided no rationale as to how this request relates
to other parts of the budget _ to other foreign aid spending, to
defense or domestic spending, to the deficit,'' he said.
   Mitchell contended that the administration has provided no plan
for future aid to the two Central American countries, or how their
priority for aid compares to that of emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
   Administration officials testifying before Congress have said
the money is needed as a speedy response to conditions that could
not have been foreseen when the White House wrote its budget for
this year. It has proposed to pay for the aid through commensurate
cuts in the Pentagon budget.
   Mitchell said he would not delay in meeting ``the genuine
emergency needs for Panama and Nicaragua.'' But he added: ``I do
not believe we should appropriate the full amount requested until
the administration submits a meaningful long-term foreign aid
plan.''
   In the first spurt of U.S. aid to emerging democracies, it was
Mitchell and Senate Democrats who led the way last year in
providing millions for Poland and Hungary. Mitchell called Bush
``timid'' for not doing more for emerging democracies.
   Mitchell's statement on Monday said ``it makes little sense for
the Congress to lurch from country to country on piecemeal
emergency foreign aid requests for different parts of the world
without some kind of an overall long-term plan'' that relates aid
to the rest of the budget.
   In a brief interview, Mitchell said the statement was not
inconsistent with last year's action, but was a response to ``the
sheer number of these one-shot requests. When they accumulate in
number, the need for an overall plan becomes apparent.''
   Mitchell further spelled out his request in a letter to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, saying the spending plan
should cover plans for the next three to five years for foreign
aid, defense spending, domestic spending and the deficit.
   The administration has not explained ``the relationship between
this request and our overall national security objectives,''
Mitchell told Baker.
   ``I believe it is essential that the Senate have such a plan
before it appropriates the emergency aid requested by the
administration for Panama and Nicaragua.''

<HEAD>Unapproved Fungicide Traces Found In Imported Wines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traces of a fungicide not approved in the
United States have been found in 11 samples of imported wines, the
Food and Drug Administration said Monday.
   There is no ban on the wines, and none is being recalled, said
FDA spokesman Bill Grigg. But the FDA is requiring the makers of
these wines to certify that they do not contain the fungicide
procymidone before they are shipped to this country.
   Grigg said the vineyards involved must retain independent
testing labs to certify that the wines are fungicide-free before
shipping them to the United States. He said the FDA will conduct
spot tests on the wines to confirm the certifications.
   The maker of procymidone, Sumitomo Chemical Co. of Osaka, Japan,
has begun providing the Environmental Protection Agency with data
on the fungicide, which is approved in Europe, the FDA said.
   This could lead to the setting of a residue tolerance by EPA.
Currently, the EPA has no tolerance levels for procymidone, which
means that no amount of it can appear in any products sold here,
Grigg said.
   He also said there is no indication the fungicide, which is
applied to grapes while they are growing, constitutes a health risk.
   The FDA initiated a 200-sample survey after traces of
procymidone were found in an Italian sparkling wine, Tosti Asti
Spumante.
   Of the 116 wine samples tested so far, seven French and three
Italian wines were found to contain traces of the fungicide.
   No traces were found in samples of wines from Australia, Brazil,
Chile, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Spain and Portugal, the FDA said.
   The agency, so far, is requiring testing of Tosti Asti Spumante,
as well as two other wines in which traces of the fungicide were
found _ Gionelli Asti Spumante and B&amp;G Saint-Louis Beaujolais.
   Residues of the fungicide also were found in the following wines:
   _Asti Spumante, Collinetta
   _Asti Spumante, Martini &amp; Rossi
   _Beaujolais, Le Chamville
   _Red, Louis Jadot
   _Vouvray, B&amp;G
   _Chablis, B&amp;G

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Has Nerve Gas, Threatens Israel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to CLARIFY that Geneva protocol bans
initial use of chemical weapons. Picks up 3rd, `Iraq is..'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said for the
first time Monday that his country has deadly binary nerve gas
weapons, and he threatened to use them on Israel if the Jewish
state attacks Iraq.
   Binary weapons, usually artillery shells or missile warheads,
contain two relatively safe compounds that combine to produce toxic
nerve gases. The first use of chemical weapons was outlawed under
the 1925 Geneva Protocol.
   Iraq is already seen as a front-runner in a Middle East drive to
develop arsenals of long-range and surface-to-surface missiles. Its
development of chemical weapons, and possibly nuclear arms, has
raised fears of an arms race in the volatile region.
   In Israel, government officials warned Monday that Israel would
retaliate if Hussein used chemical weapons against it.
   The U.S. State Department denounced Hussein's chemical weapons
threat as ``inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous.''
   Hussein, in a speech broadcast by Baghdad Radio, denied Iraq has
nuclear weapons. Concerns about this were raised last week by the
interception in London of 40 Iraqi-bound trigger devices that
officials said were designed for nuclear bombs.
   ``I categorically deny that we have any atomic bombs,'' the
president said at a ceremony in Baghdad, where he awarded medals to
senior military officers.
   Hussein claimed during the 1980-88 war with Iran, ``Iraq was
offered enriched uranium and even a complete atomic bomb by people
who were either American, British or Zionist agents. But Iraq
turned down these offers.''
   He did not elaborate. Such an offer would not be in accord with
Western efforts to block nuclear military technology to developing
nations.
   Hussein warned the Israelis if they try to repeat their June
1981 air strike on a French-built nuclear reactor near Baghdad, he
will retaliate with chemical weapons.
   ``I say that if Israel dares to hit even one piece of steel on
any industrial site, we will make the fire eat half of Israel,'' he
declared.
   ``Let them hear, here and now, that we do possess binary
chemical weapons which only the United States and Soviet Union
have.''
   In a clear reference to Israel, believed to be the only Mideast
power with nuclear weapons, Hussein said: ``Those who are
threatening us with nuclear bombs: we warn them that we will hit
them with this binary chemical weapon.''
   A statement issued in Jerusalem by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
of Israel said Hussein's remarks ``reveal once again the basic
threat at the root of the situation in the Middle East, which is .
.. the continued aspiration to destroy Israel. ... Let there be no
doubt, Israel will also know how to defend itself in the future and
defeat the evil designs of its enemies.''
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said, ``We have no aggressive
intention against anyone, including Iraq.''
   Asked about a possible preemptive strike, Pazner said: ``We
don't even want to talk about that kind of thing.''
   Western intelligence officials have long said Iraq is developing
chemical weapons at top-secret research installations.
   Only the United States and Soviet Union have officially admitted
having binary weapons, although other countries were believed to
possess them.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Nizar Hamdoon said Iraq developed the weapons during
the Iraq-Iran war but did not use them.
   Hussein said Britain and the United States should recognize
``the rights of nations and peoples to defend themselves.''
   The Iraqis have told Israel several times the last two years not
to launch preemptive strikes against its burgeoning arms industry.
Baghdad says it now is capable of producing long-range missiles and
rockets capable of putting satellites into space orbit.
   In December, Iraq announced it had tested two missiles with a
range of up to 1,200 miles, enough to reach Iran's capital and
Israeli cities.
   Hussein also made his first public comment on U.S. and British
allegations that Iraq tried to smuggle in 40 U.S.-made krytrons, or
electronic detonators for nuclear bomb detonators.
   ``These are only condensors which we bought ... and it's not
logical that these could be used in atomic bombs,'' he said.
   The Foreign Ministry released photocopies of documents it said
proved Iraq's innocence and showed that a person it identified as
an FBI agent attempted to lure Iraq into ordering the triggers.
   It said ``attempts by British and American authorities to
portray Iraq as a nuclear power are aimed at blackmailing and
pressuring Iraq to prevent Iraq from acquiring scientific and
technical know-how.''
   The ministry said the devices seized at London's Heathrow
Airport could be used for nuclear bombs but that Iraq wanted them
for use in a university laser system.
   Hussein, who has ruled Iraq as undisputed strongman since 1979,
said recent criticism against Baghdad over its human rights record
and its military ambitions was designed ``to threaten and
intimidate Iraq'' as well as ``pave the way for Israel to attack
us.''
   Israel's air force bombed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981
while Iraq was at war with Iran. Israel claimed the plant was
developing a nuclear bomb. Iraq denied it.

   Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest
health maintenance organization, was hit by a strike Monday by
11,000 nurses, technicians and maintenance workers, cutting
services at hospitals and closing some clinics.
   Workers defied the recommendation of a union negotiating team
and rejected a $44 million contract offer Friday by a
3,067-to-1,474 vote.
   A six-hour negotiating session with a federal mediator ended
Saturday without an agreement between Pasadena-based Kaiser
Permanente and Service Employees International Union Local 399.
   The company's offer includes a 5 percent to 6 percent pay raise
in the first year and a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in the
second and third years. It also guarantees that employees' wages
are 3 percent higher than the average wage at 12 Los Angeles-area
hospitals used as a yardstick.
   The union said 314 job classifications were affected. It
declined to outline its contract demands.
   ``Management knows what it will take to settle the strike,''
said union Vice President Dave Stilwell, who said the top-wage
guarantee was simply no match for the work demands placed on Kaiser
employees.
   Kaiser employees accepted a wage freeze three years ago and have
stood by the company during nine years of financial difficulty,
said union spokesman Tom Ramsay.
   ``Now that Kaiser is back on their feet and prospering,
employees expected some recognition and didn't get that, and they
were very angry,'' Ramsay said. ``Workload has gone up two- and
threefold, and employees are still being asked to sacrifice.''
   The union includes licensed vocational nurses, clerks,
housekeepers and radiology technicians at seven of the Kaiser
Permanente Medical Centers and more than 40 satellite medical
offices in Los Angeles and Orange counties.
   The hospitals affected are in Los Angeles, West Los Angeles,
Panorama City, Woodland Hills, Harbor City, Bellflower and Anaheim.
   Kaiser, a nonprofit medical institute, has more than 2.2 million
subscribers in Southern California who pay a fee for comprehensive
health care rather than the traditional pay-per-visit system.
   At Kaiser's Anaheim hospital, more than 100 workers walked the
picket lines. ``Most of us here have ourselves and families to
support. It's hard on both sides,'' said Joyce Johnston, a licensed
vocational nurse.
   Kaiser said medical care will continue to be provided to
employees not affected by the strike.
   By Monday afternoon, about 150 Kaiser patients had been
transferred to community hospitals, said company spokeswoman Janice
Seib. She said Kaiser was trying to reduce occupied beds at
affected hospitals to about 40 percent, down from a usual 75
percent.
   She said some Kaiser clinics used for annual physicals,
check-ups and outpatient treatment were closed, but could not say
how many.
   Kaiser borrowed workers from facilities unaffected by the strike
and postponed non-emergency surgery at affected hospitals, Seib
said.
   Management said union leaders did a poor job of presenting the
rejected package to members. The union agreed that members were
left confused, but said the complex contract offer was handed to
them at the last moment and was too difficult to decipher in time
for the vote.
   ``We did the best we could, and the members still didn't
understand and voted not to give management a blank check,''
Stilwell said.
   ``The feeling generally is that they misrepresented it or
presented it in an extremely negative way,'' said Seib.
   Several pickets said they might have been better informed, but
said they would still have voted to strike.

   John E. List killed his wife, three
children and mother in 1971 ``with love in his heart'' to save
their souls, his attorney argued Monday at the start of the former
Sunday school teacher's murder trial.
   List, a strictly raised Lutheran, was a ``fragmented'' product
of 19th century ethics who despaired while his family loosened
church ties and felt himself failing as a provider, said defense
lawyer Elijah L. Miller Jr.
   ``He was simply not equipped to cope, to deal with the pressure
of our times,'' said Miller.
   Arrested in Virginia in June, List is charged with first-degree
murder in the deaths of his wife, mother, daughter and two sons at
his Westfield mansion Nov. 9, 1971.
   ``On that fateful day, he slipped from despair into oblivion.
... He entered hell with his eyes open,'' said Miller.
   ``He committed these acts with love in his heart for his mother,
wife and children. For the salvation of his family he had to act as
he did.''
   The defense contends List was mentally diseased at the time, a
``diminished capacity'' argument that would let jurors return a
guilty verdict to a lesser charge. ``He is still fragmented with a
mental disease,'' Miller said.
   Assistant Union County prosecutor Brian Gillet offered a
different picture, saying List ``systematically executed ... his
own flesh and blood.''
   List's 84-year-old mother, Alma; wife, Helen, 45; daughter
Patricia, 16; and sons John, 15, and Frederick, 13, were
``unsuspecting and undeserving victims of this defendant's cruel,
evil and calculating mind,'' said Gillet.
   The prosecutor opened his brief statement by reading a five-page
letter that List had written his pastor to describe the events and
explain that he acted out of economic distress and fear for his
family's souls.
   List slumped in his chair without apparent emotion.
   Gillet told the jury how List stopped the mail and milk
deliveries, wrote notes to his children's employers and schools
saying the family was going out of town, and settled his financial
affairs. Like the accountant he was, List ``closed the books,
balanced out the accounts before he fled and took on a new life,''
said the prosecutor.
   His careful plan ``turned into a day of horror'' at the 18-room
mansion and become his family's ``worst possible nightmare.''
   After opening statements, witnesses reconstructed the family's
final day. Their testimony spoke of an idyllic suburban life, where
a car pool took the kids to school, the milkman put the milk in the
refrigerator and bank tellers knew their customers by name.
   Gene Syfert, who is married to the sister of Helen List,
testified that he talked with List about a collection of crime
books at the house during his last visit there in 1968.
   ``He indicated that he was rather obsessed with the unsolved
mystery,'' Syfert said.
   Barbara A. Baeder, who with List ran a carpool for their
children to and from school, told how she brought John Jr. home.
Police say he arrived early, and was the only victim shot more than
once. List, in his letter released last week, said John struggled.
   ``In order to snuff the life out of that young man, the
defendant needed more than 10 shots to kill him, his namesake,''
Gillet said in his opening statement.
   Mrs. Baeder's son, Richard, 13 at the time, remembered taking a
telephone message from List the evening of Nov. 9. List said Mrs.
Baeder didn't need to pick up the children because they were going
to visit their sick grandmother in North Carolina.
   Herbert L. Argast, the milkman, told how he saw a note on the
refrigerator saying, ``no more milk until further notice.'' It was
written by List on a ``nice piece of lined paper'' rather than the
usual scrap left by Mrs. List, he said.
   Bank employees told how List cashed checks totaling $285, and
$2,000 in savings bonds. The town truant officer said she went by
the home several times when the children did not come to school for
several weeks.

   Ryan White, whose battle with AIDS brought
him scorn in his hometown but support from across the world, was
hospitalized with internal bleeding Monday and was not expected to
live, authorities said.
   Doctors said Monday afternoon that White, 18, probably would not
survive the day, said Carrie Van Dyke, director of health promotion
for the State Board of Health.
   It was later disclosed, however, that White was on a
life-support system, a ventilator, that could prolong his life.
   White's chief physician, Dr. Martin B. Kleiman, declined to
speculate on White's prognosis.
   White put a youthful face on the AIDS plight. He increased
public awareness of the deadly disease and helped reinforce the
message that AIDS cannot be spread through casual contact. His
struggle was the subject of numerous accounts, including a People
magazine cover story and a televison movie.
   ``He is presently in the intensive care unit and he is in
critical condition,'' Kleiman told an afternoon news conference.
``He is heavily sedated and we feel that he is experiencing no
discomfort.''
   Van Dyke said his mother, Jeanne, and his sister, Andrea, were
among the relatives at his bedside at Riley Hospital for Children.
Jeanne and Ryan White's father, Wayne, are divorced.
   White's hemophilia, the disorder that initially exposed him to
the deadly AIDS virus, prevented doctors from operating, said Van
Dyke. She said she was told about White's condition by his mother
at lunchtime.
   ``This is it. He's not expected to come out of it,'' Van Dyke
said. ``He's not responding.''
   Van Dyke voiced a small hope White would recover, saying, ``He's
surprised us before.''
   Kleiman, White's physician since he was diagnosed as having AIDS
in 1984, said White was admitted to the hospital Thursday suffering
from a respiratory infection, which occurred as a complication of
AIDS.
   Kleiman said White's family had asked that no additional details
of his condition be released.
   White's battle with acquired immune deficiency syndrome sent him
to Washington to testify before Congress and to California for
star-studded fund-raisers. He had gained the support and close
friendship of entertainers such as Michael Jackson and Elton John.
   Last week, he appeared with former President Reagan and his
wife, Nancy, at a pre-Oscar party in Los Angeles for sick and
disadvantaged youths sponsored by Athletes and Entertainers for
Kids. The organization has established the Ryan White National
Education Program for Youth, an AIDS education forum.
   News of White's condition Monday prompted a statement of concern
from the Reagans. ``We are praying for him and his family as we are
praying for all people with AIDS and their families,'' the
statement said.
   Elton John also called White's family to express concern, Van
Dyke said.
   White's mingling with celebrities and entertainers was a cruel
contrast to the days when AIDS hysteria made it impossible for him
to mix even with his classmates. When White's case first made
headlines, misinformation combined with a lack of knowledge of the
incurable disease made White a pariah.
   But he went on to become a national spokesman for children with
AIDS after winning a court battle to attend school near his
hometown of Kokomo. However, he and his family felt ostracized
there, and moved to a new home about 20 miles away in Cicero, where
they were welcomed by the local community and school system.
   ``Personally, I would rather have given it up a long time ago,''
Mrs. White said during the court battle. ``It would have been a lot
easier on me and a lot easier on the rest of the family.
   ``But, believe it or not, Ryan has always really loved school.
Andrea (his sister) says, `Boy, I wish it would be me that could
stay home.' But this is what Ryan wants to do, and I want what he
wants.''
   His life story was told in a television movie last year and an
education program called ``I have AIDS _ A Teen-ager's Story: A
3-2-1 Contact Extra,'' which White helped develop. It was nominated
for an Emmy and won a George Peabody Award and an Ollie Award.
   White enjoyed collecting comic books, swimming and customizing
his red Mustang. He also owned two dogs, Wally and Gizmo, although
his doctors advised the family against having pets.
   Mrs. White said she allowed her son to have the dogs because she
was unable to tell him another thing he wanted was out of reach
because he had AIDS.
   ``Ryan said, `It's my life and I want a pup.' He said, `I want a
pup that likes no one but me,''' she said.
   White was diagnosed as having AIDS in 1984, when he was 13. He
contracted the disease through blood products he received to treat
his hemophilia, a disorder that impairs the blood's ability to clot
and stop bleeding.
   ``I don't think it's the AIDS as much as he's a hemophiliac and
he's bleeding internally, and that's the problem,'' Van Dyke said.
   She said White was in poor health before Thanksgiving, when they
prepared several public service announcements for World AIDS Day on

   White dropped out of classes at Hamilton Heights High School
before Christmas, she said. Officials there could not be reached
for comment Monday because the school was on spring break.
   White turned 18 on Dec. 16 in continued ill health, with a low
blood platelet count and staph infections in his eyes and legs.
   The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta says it has
recorded 2,055 cases of AIDS among children since June 1981 as of
January, accounting for 2 percent of the total number of AIDS
patients.
   There are 1,207 hemophilia patients with AIDS, or 1 percent, the
CDC said in its latest statistics released in March. Transfusion or
blood related cases account for 3 percent of the total number of
AIDS cases, or 72,153 cases, it said.

<HEAD>Bradley Wants to Be Senator Six More Years</HEAD>

   Sen. Bill Bradley announced Monday that
he will seek a third term on Capitol Hill, quashing speculation
about a 1992 presidential bid by saying he planned to represent New
Jersey for the full term.
   ``I'll say the same thing in 1990 that I said in 1984 ... that I
will serve my six-year term,'' the Democrat told about 150 people
gathered at Montclair State College. ``I can't conceive of anything
that would change it.''
   A poll of Democratic state chairmen from throughout the nation
recently put Bradley, 46, at the top of their list for the
presidential nomination in 1992. Bradley, however, said he wants to
make his contribution representing New Jersey.
   Bradley, a Rhodes scholar from Denville who played basketball
for Princeton University and the New York Knicks, is seen as one
Northeasterner who would be acceptable in more conservative regions.
   His wife, Ernestine Schlant Bradley, a professor of German and
comparative literature at Montclair State, introduced her husband.
Speaking beneath an arch of red, white and blue balloons inside the
college's student center, he talked of children, the environment
and education.
   ``I want to make sure the kids of New Jersey get their share,''
he said.
   Bradley planned a second campaign stop at a water treatment
plant outside Camden, N.J., later in the day.
   The senator is running what is expected to be a $10 million
campaign to keep his seat. Aides say most of the money will pay for
television advertising in the expensive New York and Philadelphia
media markets and fend off possible negative campaigning by the GOP.
   Republican Christine Todd Whitman, 44, of Far Hills, N.J., said
she will run a positive race strictly on the issues, including tax
and spending. Bradley declined her challenge to cap his campaign
spending at $3 million.
   He reaffirmed, however, his support Monday for public financing
of campaigns, spending limits, limits on contributions by political
action committees and reduced television costs for candidates.
   Mrs. Whitman, former president of the state Board of Public
Utilities and a former Somerset County official, anticipates
running a $1.5 million race.
   A possible GOP primary candidate is John Scott, chairman of the
Conservative Caucus of New Jersey. Candidates have until April 12
to file for a place on the June 5 primary ballot. As of Friday, no
other Democrat had filed.
   Bradley built a national record through 1986 tax reform and his
positions on Third World debt and trade relationships with Canada,
Mexico and Japan.
   In his 1978 race against Republican Jeffrey Bell, Bradley
captured 56 percent of the vote. In 1984, he defeated Mary Mochary
with 64 percent of the ballots cast.

   Inmates at Long Lartin Prison
attempted a mass breakout Monday night and about 30 convicts
barricaded themselves on a prison landing after guards foiled the
escape bid, the Home Office reported.
   At a second prison in central England, Strangeways Prison at
Manchester, nearly 100 inmates ran loose Monday but guards regained
control of much of the riot-damaged facility and officials were in
contact with the remaining inmates still inside, authorities said.
   The Home Office, which is responsible for prisons, said in a
statement that guards at low-security Long Lartin grabbed a group
of prisoners as they tried to scale the 15-foot wire mesh perimeter
fence. The guards led them back into the building without violence,
it said.
   The statement did not say how many inmates tried to break out,
but said other inmates immediately began demonstrating, forcing
guards to retreat.
   The Home Office said about 30 prisoners barricaded themselves on
one of the landings of a prison wing and kept guards at bay early
Tuesday.
   At Strangeways, prisoners hung up a flag saying ``No Dead,'' but
the government said deaths could not be ruled out in one of
Britain's worst prison riots.
   Authorities said 37 inmates and 12 prison guards had been
injured since riots began Sunday at Strangeways, one of the most
crowded jails in Britain. News media reported unconfirmed accounts
of up to 12 deaths.
   Prison staff regained control of four cell blocks and the
kitchen Monday after scores of inmates surrendered. Rioters still
held five blocks, said the Home Office.
   The Home Office said 99 prisoners were still loose, but Ivor
Serle, chairman of the Strangeways Prison Officers' Association,
put the number at 80 to 90 after more men surrendered in the
evening.
   Serle said he was in three wings of the prison and saw no bodies.
   About a dozen masked inmates remained on the steep roofs in the
night cold, waving and shouting.
   ``I think it will go on until tomorrow. ... They've got plenty
of food, plenty of drugs and plenty of fresh air,'' Serle said,
referring to looting of hospital storerooms.
   Home Secretary David Waddington said some surrendering prisoners
claimed a number of inmates were dead, but no bodies were found.
   ``But the possibility that fatalities have occurred cannot be
ruled out,'' he added.
   He said nine surrendering prisoners claimed to have been
forcibly injected with drugs by other inmates.
   The riot highlighted Britain's much-criticized prison system.
With a prison population of 47,000, Britain has the highest number
of inmates per capita in Western Europe.
   Red-brick Strangeways prison, built in 1868 to hold 970 men,
contained 1,648 prisoners Sunday. It is a local jail and contains
inmates of all categories, from extremely dangerous to low risk,
the Home Office said.
   Roy Hattersley, the opposition Labor Party's deputy leader, said
82 one-man cells were crammed with three prisoners, and 96 single
cells housed two inmates each. The inmates were confined to these
cells for all but 11 hours a week and were allowed one shower and
one change of clothing each week.
   ``If you treat men like animals, we ought not to be surprised if
they behave like animals,'' Hattersley said.
   Dr. Philip Randall of North Manchester General Hospital said
most of the more serious injuries were caused by prisoners
assaulting other prisoners.
   By late afternoon, 1,458 inmates had been transferred to prisons
and 74 were awaiting transport, the Home Office said.
   ``The (prison) governor has been in touch with the prisoners all
day long,'' said Home Office spokesman Roy Payne. ``There has been
no confrontation, no demands and no threat.''
   Police with riot gear were on stand-by along with squads of
armed officers.
   No clear indication emerged as to what caused the rioting. It
began during Sunday morning service in the prison chapel, when
inmates grabbed keys from guards and used them to gain access to
large areas of the facility.
   The inmates started fires. At one point it was feared the
19th-century Victorian prison would burn down.
   ``If you imagine a bomb dropped in World War II in a built-up
area, that's what it looks like,'' John Bartell, national chairman
of the Prison Officers' Association, said Monday. ``They've ripped
off landing rails, wire netting and doors. Anything has can be
damaged has been damaged. ... They have burned down a number of
buildings.''
   He said the prison management was warned that ``there would be a
serious disturbance this weekend,'' and he accused the Home Office
of ``criminal negligence'' for leaving only five guards to
supervise 300 men in the chapel.
   Home Office minister David Mellor, who first called the
allegation ``ridiculous,'' later said in a Sky News interview: ``I
gather there was some information given to the governor that he
regarded as very much the same kind of information he'd received on
several previous occasions when nothing had happened.''

   Lava from Kilauea Volcano on Monday
flowed toward a subdivision of 83 homes in this coastal town, and
authorities ordered most of the residents to evacuate by nightfall.
   The slow-moving flow was half a mile from Kalapana Gardens
Subdivision in the morning. A lava flow in 1986 destroyed dozens of
homes in the same area.
   Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim ordered
residents in 50 of the houses to evacuate and placed the town on
alert, meaning residents in about 150 homes could be ordered to
evacuate within 72 hours.
   Earlier, authorities evacuated four outlying homes as the flow
crossed Kalapana Bypass Highway, which lies between the town and a
lava vent six miles upslope.
   Lava came within 300 yards of the houses, then turned eastward
toward the subdivision, said Civil Defense spokesman Lanny Nakano.
   The flow posed a serious threat because the only route to the
ocean is through a populated area, said Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory spokesman Reggie Okamura.
   ``It's just a matter of time if it keeps going,'' Okamura said.
   Authorities also were monitoring a finger of lava to the east,
which was following the course of the 1986 flow. That flow was
three-quarters of a mile upslope from the highway.
   Since its latest and longest eruption began in January 1983, the
volcano has destroyed 76 homes and a national park visitor center,
causing $20 million in damage.

   Nineteen people, including eight
civilians, were killed in two clashes with Communist rebels in
widely separated areas of the Philippines, the military reported
Tuesday.
   A military report said six New People's Army guerrillas and four
soldiers died Saturday during an eight-hour firefight near Pasuquin
in Ilocos Norte province, 260 miles north of Manila.
   In another report, the military said eight civilians and one
government militiamen were slain when rebels attacked a village in
the central province of Antique during memorial services Monday for
a militiaman killed in a previous incident.
   Two civilians and one militiaman were also wounded in the raid,
staged by about 40 rebels in Valderama, about 260 miles southeast
of the capital.
   The New People's Army, the military wing of the Communist Party
of the Philippines, has been waging a 21-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.

   The young man accused of leading a white mob
charged in the slaying of a black teen-ager went on trial Monday
along with the man accused of pulling the trigger.
   Defense lawyers failed to block testimony by witnesses who
identified the pair from photographs and lineups.
   Six other young white men from Bensonhurst have been charged in
the Aug. 23 slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, a black 16-year-old who was
shot after he went with three friends into the largely Italian
section of Brooklyn to look at a used car.
   Joseph Fama, 19, who is accused of being the triggerman, and
20-year-old Keith Mondello, who authorities say was the ringleader,
are the first to stand trial. Both are charged with two counts of
second-degree murder, riot, assault, menacing and other crimes.
Each faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
   Five of the others have been charged with second-degree murder
and other crimes, and the sixth with assault.
   In a heated session Monday, attorneys for Fama, Mondello and
another defendant, Joseph Serrano, argued that the reliability of
witnesses who picked their clients out of lineups or from photo
spreads was questionable because of the publicity surrounding the
slaying.
   Fama's attorney, David DePetris, said photographs of his client
were released by the police and publicized widely, makinge it
impossible for witnesses to view a lineup objectively. Fama fled
after the attack.
   Judge Thaddeus Owens rejected the arguments and ordered the
trial to proceed.
   The judge plans to speed the proceedings by impaneling two
juries. The panels will sit side by side in the courtroom, with one
deciding the fate of Fama and the other considering Mondello's case.
   The judge also set a June 11 trial date for Serrano and Pasquale
Raucci, both 20-year-olds charged with second-degree murder.
   There may be as many as six trials, defense lawyers and
prosecutors say.
   Assistant District Attorney Edward Boyar, a lead prosecutor in
the case, came to the seventh-floor courtroom carrying a summons
ordering him to jury service Monday.
   ``I went to the clerk's office and had it delayed,'' he said,
laughing.

   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
of Honduras said Monday the top military commander of the Contra
rebels has agreed to disband his forces.
   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, a Contra spokesman said all rebel
forces remaining in that country will surrender their weapons to
U.N. monitors on April 18.
   In an accord March 23, a lower-ranking Contra commander agreed
to demobilize. But deep divisions remain in the rebel ranks, with
many rank-and-file fighters saying they won't lay down their arms
by the time the new Nicaraguan government takes office on April 25.
   Callejas made his announcement when he arrived in Nicaragua for
a two-day summit with four other Central American presidents in
Montelimar, a new beach resort 40 miles from the capital, Managua.
   The top item on the agenda was demobilizing the U.S.-backed
Contras, who have waged a 10-year war against Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   Callejas said top rebel commander Israel Galeano, also known as
Commander Franklyn, had assured him the Contras would disband by
the time President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is sworn in.
   The Honduran president spoke with reporters after meetings with
Mrs. Chamorro and Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo in
Managua. The cardinal witnessed the March accord in Honduras
between Contras representatives and those of Mrs. Chamorro.
   There have been doubts about the viability of the accord because
Galeano did not sign it and thousands of Contras have since
returned to Nicaragua with their guns.
   The accord said the rebels in Honduran base camps would
demobilize by April 20, but it did not set a deadline for those on
Nicaraguan territory. In addition, many of the rebels who were in
Honduras have reportedly slipped back into Nicaragua.
   But Callejas said Monday that Galeano has assured him his forces
will disband by April 25.
   In Tegucigalpa, Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo announced
that all Contras in Honduras will surrender their arms to a U.N.
peacekeeping force a week earlier _ April 18.
   Other rebels inside Nicaragua will gather inside security zones
to surrender their arms, as specified in the March accord, Acevedo
said in an interview. He said the decision was made by Galeano and
the rebel high command.
   He said the formal surrender of weapons by forces in Honduras
will take place at Yamales, a small town near the Nicaraguan border.
   Acevedo said their weapons consist mainly of Soviet-designed
AK-47 assault rifles, cannons, rocket-propelled grenades,
surface-to-air missiles, machine guns and mortars. He refused to
specify quantities.
   President Oscar Arias of Costra Rica spoke enthusiastically of
peace prospects when he arrived in Managua on Monday.
   He said Callejas ``has brought me the good news that the Contras
and Commander Franklyn are in total agreement on complete
demobilization.''
   Arias said that ``never before in the last 3{ years have we felt
as optimistic as now.''
   Arias won the Nobel Peace prize in 1987 for working out the
first of a series of Central American peace accords aimed at ending
civil wars in the region.
   He said he was certain the region's presidents would reach an
agreement that would encourage the Contras to hand over their guns
to a U.N. demobilization force.
   As for the civil war in El Salvador, Arias said he expected
``substantive'' agreements on a dialogue between the U.S.-backed
rightist government and the leftist guerrillas.
   Also attending the summit are Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani, Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo and outgoing
Sandinista President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to
allow California to carry out its first execution in 23 years,
letting stand an order blocking Robert Alton Harris' trip to the
state gas chamber.
   Harris, 37, who in 1978 kidnapped and murdered two San Diego
teen-agers to use their car in a $3,000 bank robbery, had been
scheduled to die in the gas chamber at 3 a.m. Tuesday.
   However, a federal appeals court judge imposed the stay Friday,
and the nation's highest court voted 6-3 Monday to reject an
emergency request from prosecutors who wanted to execute Harris on
schedule.
   Because of the Supreme Court's action, one of California's most
notorious criminal cases could drag on for months. The case, which
focuses on Harris' mental condition, will return to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, prosecutors said.
   ``There is no legal or moral reason why the execution ... should
not proceed as scheduled,'' state Attorney General John Van de Kamp
said in papers filed with the Supreme Court. ``There has never been
a question Robert Alton Harris killed the two helpless victims in
cold blood.''
   The request went to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who referred it
to the full court. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to set aside the stay
of execution and let Harris die. Voting in the majority were
Justices O'Connor, Thurgood Marshall, William Brennan, John Paul
Stevens, Byron White and Harry Blackmun.
   ``My own reaction, in a sense is one of disappointment,'' said
Van de Kamp, who personally opposes capital punishment.
   Relatives of Harris' two 16-year-old victims were angered and
saddened by the justices' decision.
   ``This is unbelievable. It's unfair. They've heard all these
arguments before,'' said William Stalder, of Carlsbad, uncle of
victim John Mayeski. ``There's nothing new. I'm finished with it,''
   Linda Herring of Escondido, sister of victim Michael Baker, said
she expected the decision.
   ``What are they going to do _ let him sit in jail and rot?'' she
said. ``Everybody protects the criminals, but what about us? I just
hope this doesn't happen to too many people, but it will, and
they'll just get the same that we did _ no justice.''
   In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian said he was disappointed
and frustrated by the Supreme Court's decision.
   Deukmejian's voice rose steadily as he listed three appeals of
the Harris case to the California Supreme Court, five appeals to
the federal court and five appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court since
the original death sentence 11 years ago.
   ``And still no resolution, still no justice. Just delay, delay
and more delay,'' Deukmejian said at a news conference.
   But death penalty opponents lauded the high court's decision to
let the stay remain, and planned to turn their vigil at the San
Quentin gates into a celebration.
   ``We are tremendously relieved that California will not become a
killer tonight,'' said Martha Kegel, spokeswoman for Death Penalty
Focus of California.
   Harris would be the nation's 122nd convicted killer put to death
since the Supreme Court's 1976 decision that allowed executions to
resume. Since January 1977, 13 states _ mostly in the South _ have
executed prisoners. Trend-setting California would be the most
populous state to carry out a death sentence.
   California voters overwhelmingly favored executing Harris,
reflecting the public's longstanding support for capital
punishment, a statewide poll found.
   According to the Los Angeles Times Poll released Monday, 60
percent said they favored Harris' execution, 16 percent were
opposed, 5 percent were undecided and 19 percent hadn't heard
enough to respond.
   During the six-day telephone survey, 1,667 registered voters
were asked if they favored the execution of Harris, noting he would
be the first to die in the California gas chamber since 1967. The
margin of error is 3 percent.
   Death penalty opponents held a prayer vigil a few miles from San
Quentin.
   ``This execution will of course make many feel that justice has
been done. Many will feel avenged. But many of us will feel sad
because we know the cycle of violence and death will continue,''
said Roman Catholic Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco.
   ``We know that Robert Harris' death will not stop the hatred,
the crime and the violence which rages in our cities and towns,''
Quinn told about 75 people who attended the service in the chapel
of the 172-year-old Mission San Rafael before a march to the prison.
   Prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to intervene after a
conservative federal appeals judge in San Francisco issued the
stay, saying further studies of Harris' mental condition may be
necessary.
   The decision by Judge John Noonan of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals came after identical defense arguments that Harris had
inadequate psychiatric help at the time of his trial and may have
mental disorders were rejected by the state Supreme Court and a
federal judge in San Diego.

<TEXT>
   Conoco Inc. said Monday it has proposed
a $23 million settlement that would involve buying nearly 400
houses where residents say the groundwater was tainted with
hydrocarbons.
   Conoco lawyer Mark Zehler said he believed the agreement is one
of the largest relocation settlements ever in the country.
   ``Conoco agreed to the settlement because it is the right thing
to do _ for these residents, for Ponca City and for Conoco,'' said
the oil refinery's manager, Dennis Parker.
   Two comparable cases involved government money: the evacuation
of homes built atop tons of chemical waste at Love Canal in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., and the virtual abandonment of Times Beach, Mo., which
was tainted by dioxin. The Love Canal buyout involved about $19
million to purchase 232 homes. In Times Beach, about $33 million
was spent to buy 393 properties.
   The Conoco proposal, which must be approved by a federal judge
in Oklahoma City, calls for the company to buy almost 400 houses
and residential lots and to establish a $5 million settlement fund.
Conoco said the property acquisition could cost $18 million.
   Anthony Roisman, a lawyer for the residents, says anyone
involved in the lawsuit will be entitled to share in the fund.
Conoco does not have the number of plaintiffs involved in the
class-action suit, said Lynn Hohensee, a company spokesman.
   Conoco said the settlement would resolve the lawsuit without
either party admitting liability or responsibility for any claims,
injuries or damages.
   Homeowners in the Circle Drive residential area in southwest
Ponca City had complained since 1987 that groundwater laced with
hydrocarbons seeped into their basements and threatened their
health. Some residents camped out at the state Capitol in Oklahoma
City for weeks in 1988 to get the state to buy their houses.
   ``To Conoco and du Pont we say `thank you' in coming forth with
this settlement,'' said resident Anna Sue Rafferty. ``I'd just like
to say none of us is happy to be leaving our home. No one intended
to get rich.''
   Conoco is a subsidiary of du Pont Inc.
   Conoco had noted that other oil refinery operations have been
based in the area over the years.
   ``There has been steady progress on the technical aspects of a
groundwater remediation effort,'' Parker said. ``There has not been
corresponding resolution of the many difficulties experienced by
the people, and those considerations also deserve our attention.''
   If approved, the settlement would allow owners and renters of
property within a certain area of the northern Oklahoma city to
receive financial payments and relocate. Residents of a larger area
of the neighborhood could receive payments because of their
proximity to the groundwater problems and the activities needed to
fix it.
   A hearing on the proposal is scheduled June 5 in Oklahoma City.
   Conoco would pay residents who participate the appraised value
of their homes, an above market-value premium, a moving and
household disruption bonus and various other bonuses and incentives.
   Zehler said residents would have six months from when the
settlement is approved to seek an appraisal.

<HEAD>Newspapers Should Explore Videotex Before Phone Companies: Exec</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper industry's reluctance to
embrace videotex threatens to create a vacuum that telephone
companies and others eventually will fill, a top newspaper
executive said March 26.
   ``We ought to be asking ourselves if we are not in the local
information business'' instead of the newspaper business, said
Phillip J. Meek, president of the publishing division of Capital
Cities-ABC Inc., and former publisher of the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.
   Speaking at the annual meeting of the Texas Daily Newspaper
Association, Meek chided the industry for failing to pursue
videotex _ computer-delivered information.
   He said the failure could leave the market open for telephone
companies and other competitors.
   The newspaper industry has fought efforts by American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. and some regional phone companies to provide
information over existing lines, but Meek said he is ``frustrated
and alarmed that nothing is happening'' within the industry to fill
the void.
   Although currently restricted, ``sooner or later, if newspapers
don't do something, the phone companies ought to come in,'' Meek
said.
   Some large newspaper chains have offered videotex services with
little success, and some experts doubt videotex will develop a
following among the general public.
   Meek said those past failures have scared off other newspaper
ventures.
   ``It's a narrow audience, but it's a decent business,'' said
Meek, who oversaw the creation of StarText, a videotex service of
the Fort Worth newspaper.
   Meek said StarText, begun in 1982, now has about 4,200
subscribers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, more than Prodigy, a
similar venture of IBM and Sears Roebuck and Co.
   Newspapers must also be aware of attempts to slice up their
traditional markets, he said, pointing to the proliferation of free
publications that advertise homes, jobs, cars and other items that
normally make up a newspaper's classified ad section.
   Suggesting the industry provide some of those publications, he
said, ``If it makes sense, it's going to happen.''
   Meek also called on the executives to fight proposed changes in
U.S. Postal Service regulations that would reduce the mailing costs
of ``saturation'' publications while raising fees for newspapers by
$20 per thousand.
   ``It's an unfair break to one segment of direct mail that just
puts pressures on newspapers,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Suburban Kansas City Afternoon Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban Kansas City publisher said
March 29 he plans to launch an afternoon tabloid newspaper designed
to appeal to ``news addicts'' in the wake of the shutdown of the
afternoon Kansas City Star.
   Stephen F. Rose, president and co-publisher of Sun Publications
Inc., said The Evening News will be published Monday through Friday
beginning May 14.
   The paper will cost 50 cents and focus on national and
international news provided by The Associated Press, business news
and national and local sports.
   It will be sold at newsstands, convenience stores and newspaper
racks throughout the metropolitan area but won't be distributed to
homes, which Rose said would boost expenses and require earlier
news deadlines.
   ``We expect it to appeal to busy people who want more
information, people who don't want to wait 24 hours to find out
what happened today,'' Rose said.
   On March 1, The Kansas City Star Co. stopped publishing the
afternoon Star, merged it with the morning Times and began
publishing a seven-day, morning newspaper called The Kansas City
Star.
   ``We certainly felt it left a vacuum,'' Rose said.
   Joe McGuff, editor of the Star, said he didn't know enough
details to comment.
   ``We'll just have to wait and see if a paper of that type will
work in the afternoon,'' McGuff said.
   Rose said he would begin publishing 25,000 copies a day.
   ``We don't think that's an unreasonable hope, but we don't have
to sell 25,000 papers for this to be viable, depending on the
advertising,'' he said.
   Rose, 42, the sole investor, declined to provide financial
details but said he's saving some money by using Sun Publications'
printing press, other equipment and some employees.
   Sun Publications, owned by Rose's family, currently publishes 18
twice-weekly papers in suburban Kansas City, plus two weeklies.

   Media and entertainment giant Time Warner Inc.
said March 27 it has agreed to buy Lane Publishing Co. and certain
related assets for $225 million in cash and stock.
   The family-owned Lane of Menlo Park, Calif., publishes Sunset,
The Magazine of Western Living and owns Sunset Books and Sunset

   The purchase would be the first major acquisition for Time
Warner since Time Inc. completed its $14 billion acquisition of
Warner Communications Inc. in January.
   Under an agreement in principle, Time Warner said it would pay
$80 million in cash and $145 million in preferred stock for Lane.
   The purchase would give Time Warner a second major regional

<HEAD>Publisher, Restaurant Group Launch Magazine With a Menu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diners at more than 60 New York restaurants are
getting more than a menu when they stop in for a meal.
   A new venture owned by a specialty publishing concern and a
company that owns restaurants is stapling the menus inside a new
general interest magazine called Knife &amp; Fork.
   The magazine, given to all customers, is being billed as a means
of reaching young affluent consumers who spend little time watching
television. If it is successful in New York, its owners say they
may expand it nationally.
   Knife &amp; Fork is a creation of a 50-50 joint venture by the
publishing company Performance Network Inc. of Lindenhurst, N.Y.,
and The Riese Organization, a privately held company that owns more
than 300 restaurants in the New York area and has investment stakes
in more than 100 others nationwide.

<HEAD>Anti-Roman Catholic Editorial Prompts Closing of College Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAVER FALLS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geneva College closed its student
newspaper March 26 for the rest of the semester after it published
an editorial critical of Roman Catholics.
   Geneva is affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church,
though Catholics comprise the largest religious group on campus.
   The decision came as the result of ``a firestorm of complaints''
about Editor Eric Dugan's editorial, said college spokesman William
Gibbs.
   The editorial in The Cabinet, titled ``Theology of the Pointy
Hats,'' says senior clerics in the Catholic Church _ who were
referred to as ``pointy hats'' _ have become authoritarian and
their councils and traditions ``supersede Scripture.''
   The editorial says Protestants use the Bible to assess the
validity of their leaders' statements.
   ``The Catholic, however, finds most of his faith and practice
moored in the sayings of popes and councils, which frequently
contradict each other,'' the editorial says. ``And just what if one
pope isn't exactly holy? His words are still law.''
   The editorial closes, ``He who holds to teachings which
contradict the Bible finds a final resting place with the serpent.''
   Gibbs said the decision to close the paper wasn't censorship but
was an apology to Geneva's students, particularly Catholics, who
account for about one-fifth of the 1,200 students.
   Dugan said the board acted out of fear the college would lose
students and tuition.
   ``The college has responded in the way it has, in my opinion,
not because of its theological persuasion, but because of the
wealth of their pocketbooks,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper-Solid Waste Connection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers must fight the public
perception they are causing the avalanche of solid waste that
threatens to overwhelm the nation's landfills, industry executives
said March 26.
   ``There is a national misperception that newspapers are creating
the problem,'' Sandra Hardy, vice president of Calkins Newspapers,
told members of the Texas Daily Newspapers Association.
   Newspapers account for only about 6 to 8 percent of solid waste,
said Ms. Hardy.
   Some city and state governments have begun requiring citizens to
separate waste paper, and two states already have laws requiring
newspapers to use recycled paper, said Tonda Rush, director of
industry affairs for the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
Eighteen more states are considering similar measures, she said.
   But the supply of recycled paper is limited, she said. Printing
of an ANPA publication entitled ``Read Then Recycle'' had to be
limited because of the scarcity of the recycled paper used to
publish it.

<HEAD>New Paper Targets Capital Insiders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not hearing enough about the federal
government? Roger Kranz hopes so and he's prepared to fill the gap
with gossip, news and opinion pieces about the capital's major
industry.
   Kranz is launching the Washington Reporter, a new daily
newspaper to be distributed free to 30,000 lawyers, lobbyists,
journalists, members of Congress and other ``insiders.''
   ``They must read many, many publications to really find out
what's going on in Washington,'' said Kranz, who quit his job as
group vice president of the National Journal to publish the new
paper.
   The 16-page Washington Report is scheduled for launch Oct. 1.
Jim Glassman, editor of Roll Call, a twice-weekly newspaper about
Congress, is not optimistic.
   ``People are overwhelmed with paper. And this, if it ever gets
published, is going to overwhelm them even more,'' Glassman said.
``We brought up the idea (of going daily) with our readers, and
were told, `God, no, I've got enough stuff on my desk.'''
   Kranz said he is still trying to raise the $12.45 million needed
for the newspaper's first year.
   The front page of a prototype edition features articles about
the Federal Election Commission, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, a sensitive high-tech telephone deal with the
Soviet Union, the House since Jim Wright's departure and President
Bush's capital gains tax cut proposal.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Denies Ad Cut Linked to Labor Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nordstrom Inc. says its decision to cut
advertising in Seattle's two daily newspapers was not linked to
coverage of the apparel retailer's labor problems.
   Cindy Demme, Nordstrom vice president for sales promotion, said
on March 27 the upscale clothing retailer had been trying different
mixes of advertising media in other markets and wanted to do the
same in Seattle.
   The company cut its ads in The Seattle Times and the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer from three full-page and three smaller ads on
March 22 to one full page a week later.
   The newspapers share joint business and advertising functions
but have separate editorial operations under a joint operating
agreement.
   Times ad director Marji Ruiz said Nordstrom is one of the
afternoon paper's top 10 advertisers.
   Nordstrom's stormy labor relations and declining profits and
stock prices have received extensive media coverage, including a
front-page article in The Wall Street Journal detailing complaints
of past and present employees. Reporter Susan C. Faludi said she
interviewed more than 30 people for the story.
   Company co-chairman Jim Nordstrom called the Times coverage
``horrible ... worse than The Wall Street Journal because that girl
didn't know us. She just regurgitated what the union said.''
   Michael Fancher, Times executive editor, said he felt no
pressure to alter coverage.
   ``I think it's important for readers to understand that when
advertisers purchase an ad, they are buying exposure to our
readers. Nothing more and nothing less. ... We're a neutral
reporting voice, and that's our role.''

<HEAD>Two Post Reporters Kept From Trump News Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle of the Trumps and the city's tabloid
war joined March 26 when two New York Post reporters were barred
from a news conference held by Ivana Trump's attorney.
   Jerry Nachman, editor of the Post, said his newspaper was not
told by any of the parties involved about the news conference held
by Michael Kennedy to announce the filing of court papers.
   ``Other people told us,'' he said.
   When the reporters and a photographer arrived, they were blocked
by two men from entering the conference room where the news
conference was under way.
   ``From what I understand, this was because Mr. Kennedy doesn't
like our coverage,'' Nachman said. ``He can't exclude an element of
the press and then claim he doesn't like the coverage he gets from
that element of the press.''
   Gossip columnist Liz Smith of the Daily News broke the story of
the breakup and has been accused of favoring Mrs. Trump in the
ensuing media frenzy, a charge she has denied.
   Trump gave his side of the story to Post columnist Cindy Adams.

<HEAD>Sportswriter Arrested in Drug Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tampa Tribune sportswriter was arrested
March 30 in what police said was a five-month investigation into a
crack cocaine ring.
   Cary Lewis Waldman, 31, was charged with racketeering,
possession of crack cocaine and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine,
which carries a minimum mandatory three-year prison sentence.
   Waldman, who has worked in the Tribune sports department for
seven years, was suspended indefinitely without pay, said Managing
Editor Lawrence McConnell.
   Prosecutors gave Waldman a reduced bail of $10,000 because they
don't consider him likely to flee, said police Detective Mike
Fendle.
   Waldman, recently assigned to the soccer beat, refused to
comment, The Tribune reported.
   Tribune Sports Editor Tom McEwen said Waldman was a good
reporter.
   ``He has been willing and ambitious. He seemed on top of the
world, devoted to his work and his family. And he is innocent until
proven guilty,'' McEwen said.
   Detectives said the ring operated for several years, making
wholesale and retail dope deals. Waldman was not a leader in the
organization but had been making regular crack deals with others in
the ring, said Detective Jerry Weiss.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Tribune set an April 2 launch for a
fax-delivered daily news sheet designed to bring closing Wall
Street prices and word of top-level corporate personnel changes to
busy executives.
   The one-page Tribfax is to be compiled by Tribune editors and
transmitted by 4:30 p.m. CDT each business day via US Sprint
facilities in Overland Park, Kan.
   A yearly subscription costs $400.
   ``It will be primarily business and financial news, but we'll do
other news _ and sports if there's something breaking,'' Tribune
spokesman Jeffrey D. Bierig said.
   He said the paper had lined up three charter advertisers. One
banner ad will run across the bottom of the page each day.

<HEAD>Unions: Not Much Optimism in Daily News Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Further talks between the Daily News and its
unions were scheduled after the newspaper's contract expired March
30.
   The News ran advertisements in its April 1 editions seeking, in
case of a strike, replacements for reporters, drivers and pressmen,
as well as workers in advertising, finance, promotion and
circulation.
   At the same time, the ``bug,'' or logo, normally on Page 2
indicating union work, failed to appear. A management source who
spoke on condition of anonymity had earlier said the bug would be
removed.
   The approximately 800 reporters and office workers belonging to
Local 3 of the Newspaper Guild were to receive a letter from
Publisher James Hoge and a copy of the paper's latest proposal.
   The bargaining unit has until April 9 to accept the entire
package or at least be negotiating a counterproposal before the
offer disappears.
   ``The way things are going, it is almost impossible to reach a
solution with management,'' said George McDonald, president of the
Allied Printing Trades Council.
   Both sides say the negotiations are the most critical ever to
the News' survival. The paper says it needs to invest $500 million
in new plants to stay competitive.
   The News says it needs concessions to cut $50 million to $70
million annually in costs to make the paper profitable.

<HEAD>Journalists Are Lazy, Say Bernstein and Deaver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOREST GROVE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Bernstein and former top Reagan
aide Michael Deaver agreed on one point at a college forum March
29: Many journalists are lazy, and it shows.
   Bernstein, who helped break the story of the Watergate scandal,
and Deaver, who managed public relations for President Reagan, were
the featured speakers at the Tom McCall Forum at Pacific University.
   Deaver said it was too easy to manipulate reporters, and
Bernstein said too many of his colleagues skim the surface of an
issue.
   ``It's hard work and we're lazy in journalism today,'' said
Bernstein, a former Washington Post reporter and ABC bureau chief
who is now an author and correspondent for Time Magazine.
   ``The media I've had a lot to do with is lazy,'' agreed Deaver.
``Yes, we fed them and they ate it every day.''
   Deaver was Reagan's deputy chief of staff and conceived the
practice of having the president appear in front of visually
appealing backdrops to make his point.

<HEAD>Police To Check Report Missing Carrier Sighted in Mexico</HEAD>

   Police say it's a long shot, but they're
sending two officers to a Mexican resort to check a possible
sighting of a Des Moines newspaper carrier missing for six years.
   A relative reported seeing a young man who resembled Eugene
Martin while she was at the airport in Cancun on March 17, but did
not approach him.
   ``They were coming through Cancun, they were transferring planes
there, and she ran across this young man that looked like Gene and
looked so much like me when I was 18 years old that it was really
frightening to her,'' Donald Martin, the youngster's father, said
March 27. ``She wanted to say something to the boy but ... she was
afraid she would get in trouble with the law if she approached the
boy or anything.''
   Eugene, 13 at the time, disappeared early in the morning of Aug.
12, 1984, while delivering The Des Moines Sunday Register in a
residential area.
   Another Des Moines news carrier, Johnny Gosch, has been missing
since Sept. 5, 1982, when he was 12.

<HEAD>Debut of Renamed, Redesigned Saint Paul Pioneer Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The renamed and redesigned Saint Paul
Pioneer Press debuted March 26 with changes intended to make the
newspaper more attractive and accessible to readers.
   The newspaper, which had been known as the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch since 1986, dropped ``Dispatch'' to shorten the
name, Publisher John Henry said in a column published March 25.
   The word ``Saint'' is spelled out in the new name ``to reinforce
and leave no doubt about thng
guidelines to be applied uniformly in federal courts.
   But judges must use discretion in deciding which convicts will
pay for their prison stay. Only those who can afford the monthly
payment of $1,210.05, plus $91.66 a month during probation, can be
ordered to pay.
   Those fees, calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, cannot be
imposed if they would leave the defendant's family destitute or on
welfare, said Paul Martin, a commission spokesman.
   ``It was kind of a very simple thought _ select those folks who
have the ability to pay for their cost of incarceration or
supervision,'' Martin said. ``It's mainly earmarked, of course, for
the `white collar' defendant, someone who has some financial
resource.''
   Of the 45,000 cases that reach federal court every year, few
criminals appear to fit the bill.
   ``Most people who are put away in the federal court system are
indigent. They don't have a dime. I've had clients who didn't have
enough money to buy a six-pack of beer,'' said Ron Wheeler, an
attorney in Des Moines.
   Last year, Wheeler represented a University of Iowa student
charged with possessing LSD with the intent to sell. The student,
Matthew Follett of Kenilworth, Ill., pleaded guilty.
   In August, U.S. District Judge Charles Wolle sentenced Follett
to seven years in prison plus four years of probation.
   Noting that Follett had a substantial trust fund, Wolle also
fined Follett $20,000 and ordered him to pay for his prison stay,
plus the monthly fee during probation.
   ``I don't have any problem with that at all,'' Wheeler said.
``If they're convicted and can pay the cost of being kept in
prison, I think they should.''
   ``It looks nice on paper, but in actuality, there aren't a lot
of these kinds of defendants.''
   In February, in another drug-related case, U.S. District Judge
Francis J. Boyle of Providence, R.I., ordered three men accused of
supplying 75 percent of the city's heroin to pay the costs of their
confinement.
   ``It's the just thing to do,'' Boyle said at the time. ``To the
extent that a defendant is able to pay for it, the defendant should
be required to.''
   Wilkins and others who support the program say requiring inmates
to pay for imprisonment isn't meant as a deterrent.
   ``The deterrent effect comes through the imposition of a prison
term,'' the judge said.
   One critic of the program is Alvin J. Bronstein, director of the
National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, who
noted that the federal prison system is running at 170 percent of
capacity ``and getting worse every month.''
   ``It is clear to me that federal prisons today are basically
unconstitutional because of the conditions of overcrowding,
inadequate medical care and all the problems created by that mass
of overcrowding,'' he said.
   ``It seems unseemly and highly inappropriate _ if not illegal _
to be requiring defendants to pay for room and board, or the cost
of being incarcerated, in an unconstitutional facility,'' Bronstein
said.

<HEAD>Foreign Journalists Forced From Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western journalists covering Lithuania's standoff
with Moscow from the Baltic republic's capital were ordered to
leave the country and most, if not all, were out by April 1.
   More than 100 journalists based in Moscow and other European
capitals followed events from Vilnius before they were ordered to
leave.
   Despite the greater freedom of movement permitted under
glasnost, Soviet authorities have routinely closed areas stricken
by ethnic violence to foreign journalists. Some regions regarded as
strategically or politically sensitive are closed at all times,
others only temporarily.
   The order restricting journalists' access to Lithuania came as
the Kremlin increased pressure on the rebellious republic and as
Lithuanian leaders sought to use the Western media to protect them
from a use of force to crush their effort to establish an
independent state.
   Moscow-based foreign journalists must give the Soviet Foreign
Ministry advance notice of any plans to travel outside the Soviet
capital, including the dates and means of their travel and where
they will stay outside Moscow.
   The Soviet government may refuse to permit the trip, temporarily
closing areas to foreigners. The Foreign Ministry on March 23
stopped permitting most Moscow-based reporters from traveling to
Lithuania and ordered a number of diplomats out of the republic.

That country could activate transmitters capable of blocking U.S.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. said March 29
it had agreed to sell Star magazine for $400 million in cash and
stock to the publisher of its saucy rival, The National Enquirer.
   G.P. Group Inc. said it plans to ``maintain the Star's editorial
independence'' and would continue to publish it from the magazine's
current location in the New York suburb of Tarrytown.
   The agreement comes almost a year after G.P. Group itself was
acquired by a partnership led by the romance magazine publisher
Macfadden Holdings Inc. for $412.5 million.
   G.P. Group also publishes a third sensationalist tabloid, Weekly
World News.
   The Star has an average weekly circulation of 3.6 million,
according to News Corp. executives. The National Enquirer's average
weekly circulation is 4.1 million and Weekly World News is at
950,000, according to G.P. Group.
   Under terms of the agreement involving the Star, News Corp.
would be paid about $200 million in cash and would get the balance
in preferred stock of the company that would publish the Enquirer,
the Star and Weekly World News.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Against Glamour Magazine Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on March 27 dismissed the lawsuit of
a Minneapolis woman who alleged that Glamour magazine went too far
in identifying her in a story about sexual exploitation by
therapists.
   The woman agreed to provide the magazine details of the sexual
abuse she suffered during psychiatric therapy in 1979 and 1980. But
she had asked not to be identified or ``identifiable'' in the story
and sued The Conde Nast Publishing Inc. and writer Claudia Dreifus
for breach of contract.
   Even though the September 1988 article gave the woman a
fictitious last name, it went on to describe her as a Minneapolis
attorney and gave specifics about her activism on issues involving
sexual abuse of patients by therapists.
   U.S. District Judge Harry H. MacLaughlin said the agreement
between Dreifus and the woman was ``too ambiguous to be enforced.''
   Dreifus had testified that the woman ``wanted some kind of
masking,'' but ``was very casual about it,'' according to court
records. The judge said Dreifus honored the woman's only specific
``masking'' request by not describing problems she had at one of
her previous jobs.
   The woman knows only two people who identified her from the
article and they had been therapists for her, the judge said. The
article portrayed the woman as ``someone who successfully recovered
from an exploitative situation,'' MacLaughlin wrote.
   To enforce reporter-source agreements in litigation, plaintiffs
``at a minimum'' must prove ``specific, unambiguous terms and to
provide clear and convincing proof that the agreement was
breached,'' the judge wrote.
   ``The court has no doubt that in balancing the rights of the
free press with common contractual rights, the free press rights
under the First Amendment must be given preference,'' the decision
said.
   Elliot Rothenberg of Minneapolis, the woman's attorney, said he
is discussing with his client the possibility of an appeal.
   If an appeal is filed, Rothenberg said he would almost certainly
again invoke the case of Dan Cohen, a Twin Cities public relations
agent who received a $700,000 jury award in a breach of contract
lawsuit against the Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch.

<HEAD>Indiana Court Protects Reporters Who Question Grand Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A divided Indiana Supreme Court, in a case
watched closely by media groups across the nation, ruled March 27
that two newspaper reporters can't be held in contempt of court for
questioning former members of a grand jury.
   In a 3-2 decision, the court threw out earlier state Court of
Appeals decisions that said reporter Mark Kiesling of The Times of
Hammond and William Heltzel, formerly a reporter at the paper,
could be held in contempt because they violated the secrecy of the
grand jury system.
   The contempt citations were sought by former Lake County
Prosecutor Jack F. Crawford after The Times published stories in
1987 detailing why a grand jury impaneled in 1984 didn't return
indictments in an investigation of a township trustee's office in
that county.
   A Lake County court had thrown out the contempt request before
the Court of Appeals, in two 1989 decisions, ruled that the secrecy
of the grand jury was ``of paramount importance'' and the reporters
could be punished for inducing jurors to violate hat secrecy.
   The three-justice majority of the Supreme Court held that while
the reporters' actions weren't protected by the freedom of the
press guarantee in the First Amendment, they didn't rise to the
level of contempt because the questioning of the jurors occurred
long after the jury had been dismissed.
   The court said the need to protect the secrecy of the grand jury
is at its ``peak while the grand jury is in the process of hearing
testimony, deliberating and voting. Once the proceedings are over
and the grand jurors have been discharged, however, the need to
protect these policies falls off dramatically.''
   The court took note of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision
striking down a Florida law permanently barring grand jury
witnesses from talking about their testimony. However, the Indiana
justices said that because their decision was focused narrowly on
the issue of contempt, they didn't have to address the larger issue
of permanent bans on disclosure of grand jury information.
   ``We're absolutely delighted,'' said Jan M. Carroll, who filed a
friend-of-the court brief on behalf of a group of media
organizations including the American Society of Newspaper Editors
and the Society of Professional Journalists.
   ``This case had far-reaching effects, not only for reporters but
for any citizen who had the temerity to ask questions about a grand
jury,'' said Carroll.

<HEAD>Houston Chronicle Wins Libel Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A county jury ruled March 26 that the
Houston Chronicle did not libel a court reporter in a 1982 news
story.
   The jury said that seven out of eight contested sentences in the
article were true or substantially true. One time frame in the
story was found to be incorrect but not libelous.
   Court reporter Norma Stewart sued eight years ago for more than
$2 million, alleging that the article libeled her and damaged her
reputation.
   The article detailed the delay in setting an execution date for
Roger Leroy DeGarmo, convicted of the kidnap-slaying of a Houston
medical technician.
   DeGarmo has not been executed.
   The article also discussed the delay in completing the trial
transcript for automatic review by the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals.
   Wayne Strickler, the victim's father, had called Ms. Stewart's
handling of the DeGarmo transcript an ``obstruction of justice.''

   The Journal of the American Medical Association

   JAMA said March 29 the main reasons for its publishing earlier

more time at week's end to develop spinoff stories. The change
begins the week of April 2.

President Bush about broccoli at the annual Gridiron Club dinner
March 31.
   Following the 105-year-old club's tradition, the journalists

<HEAD>CBS Sports Drops Brent Musburger After 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brent Musburger, the smooth-talking announcer who
was the voice and face of CBS Sports in the '80s, was let go by the
network April 1 after he and CBS failed to agree on a new contract.
   ``I was surprised, but it was a great run and I have a million
memories, and I leave behind a lot of good friends,'' Musburger
said in a statement. ``At this time, I'm going to take an extended
vacation, and I'll be working again someday, somewhere.''
   The move stunned Musburger's colleagues, some of whom thought it
was an April Fool's joke.
   ``I'm shocked,'' sportscaster Greg Gumbel said. ``I think most
everyone assumed that Brent was going to continue to be the primary
voice of CBS Sports.''
   Neal Pilson, president of CBS Sports, said it was a difficult
decision to let Musburger go after 15 years.
   ``We simply felt we wanted to give more opportunities to some of
the younger people who currently work for us,'' Pilson said. ``We
were asked by Brent's representative to make a decision, and that's
what we did.''
   Musburger's 5{-year contract with CBS, which reportedly paid him
about $2 million per year, expires in July. Pilson said money
wasn't a major factor in the negotiations, but he wouldn't name the
key issues in the dispute.

<HEAD>Preferential Awards of Licenses Backed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorities say they've gotten a small toehold
in broadcasting thanks to 18-year-old rules that give them
preference in seeking radio and television station licenses.
   The Federal Communications Commission's minority and female
preference rules have allowed ``missing voices'' to be heard,
backers of the rules told the Supreme Court on March 28.
   Opponents, however, said the rules discriminate against white
males. They contended the rules should be dropped and the
marketplace should determine the bidding.
   Minority ownership of the country's stations has increased from
1 percent a few years ago to 3 percent.
   Two cases in Florida and Connecticut involve challenges to
broadcast minority preferences.
   ``It's clear that the court is very troubled by what the FCC is
doing,'' Andrew Schwartzman of the Media Access Project, a
supporter of the rules, said following the oral arguments. ``It's
always dangerous to guess (what the court will decide) but I'm not
too optimistic.''
   The Supreme Court upheld a federal public works set-aside
program in 1980, saying Congress had special authority under the
Constitution to enact such programs.
   But last year the court, with a newly conservative majority,
struck down a similar set-aside program for minority contractors
run by the city of Richmond, Va.

<HEAD>Tighter Regulation in Store for Cable Sector, Broadcasters Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer complaints and runaway rates will bring
the ``pay TV'' industry under increased government regulation, the
nation's broadcasters were told March 31.
   ``We began the 1980s with cable an infant industry, crying for
special privilege just to survive,'' Edward O. Fritts, president of
the National Association of Broadcasters, said in his ``state of
the industry'' address at the NAB's convention.
   ``Cable is multiplying faster than radio formats,'' Fritts said,
calling for Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to
``restore enough balance to the competitive forces to let consumers
decide how much programming they want for free.''
   Legislative efforts are under way to allow price controls in
areas where cable companies have monopolies, and to enable
communities to better ride herd on the service the companies
provide.
   Congress should not regulate cable TV programming, but cracking
down on service and prices is another matter, said Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   Congress is likely to restore the ``must-carry'' provision,
requiring cable companies to carry local TV broadcasting, Hollings
predicted.

   A camera mounted near the nest was switched back on March 26

kind of wait to see the bird move or the eggs or whatever. It's

   Running cable to the building and mounting the camera behind
reflective glass cost about $10,000, Lambert said.
   ``We often joke around the office that we spend tens and
hundreds of thousands of dollars on new customer service features
or new programming services and almost as a second thought we

<HEAD>Society of Professional Journalists Announces 1989 Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Society of Professional Journalists has
awarded its 1989 Sigma Delta Chi Award for deadline reporting to
the San Francisco Examiner staff for coverage of the Oct. 17
earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay area.
   The award was one of 26 for print and broadcast journalism
announced April 1 by the Chicago-based society, which has issued
awards annually since 1940. This year's winners will receive
plaques and bronze medallions at a banquet May 5 in Tulsa, Okla.
   The society's judges said the Examiner's coverage was the best
of several entries from newspapers that reported on the earthquake.
   ``The lead was exceptional, telling and thorough, as were the
pages and pages of articles in the special 16-page all-news issue
the day after the earthquake,'' the judges said in a statement.
   They noted that the special edition was put together without
electricity and with only five telephone lines operating.
   Two San Francisco radio stations and a television station also
received awards for their earthquake coverage.
   KCBS won the award for radio spot news for its 84 hours of
continuous commercial-free news and information after the Oct. 17
earthquake, while the television spot news reporting award went to
the staff of KGO-TV.
   The award for public service in radio journalism went to KGO for
a retrospective on the Oct. 17 earthquake.

   Brent Musburger, the smooth-talking announcer who
was the voice and face of CBS Sports in the '80s, becomes a free
agent tonight.
   Musburger was let go by the network Sunday after they failed to
agree on a new contract. His farewell broadcast will be tonight's
NCAA basketball championship game between Duke and the University
of Nevada at Las Vegas.
   ``I was surprised, but it was a great run and I have a million
memories, and I leave behind a lot of good friends,'' Musburger
said in a statement. ``At this time, I'm going to take an extended
vacation, and I'll be working again someday, somewhere.''
   The move stunned Musburger's colleagues, some of whom thought it
was an April Fool's joke.

   A man who donated one of his kidneys seven years
ago to save his mother's life died hours before she could pay him
back today with a bone marrow transplant.
   Hilliary Mitchell, 37, who had been unable to work as a truck
driver since contracting leukemia, was scheduled to receive the
bone marrow from his mother, Ernestine, 56.
   But Mitchell was unable to hang on for the potentially
life-saving procedure. He died at 11:25 p.m. Sunday, said nursing
coordinator Ann Jagliella of the University of Chicago Hospitals.
   Mitchell had already won one battle in getting the money for the
$150,000 transplant from the state Medicaid program after Gov.
James R. Thompson stepped in and reversed a decision denying funds
for the operation.

   A worldwide celebration of the environment
will envelop this battered and polluted planet this month, and by

   Even corporate America wants to get involved.
   Planning for the environmental extravaganza has been in the
works for more than a year. President Bush has proclaimed April 22
Earth Day, and governors and mayors across the country are issuing
similar proclamations.
   That spring Sunday comes exactly 20 year after Earth Day '70

   Soviet defector Alexander Ushakov outwitted
two carloads of KGB gumshoes to make a daring escape to the West
six years ago. Now he's plotting another humiliation for the Soviet
secret police.
   Ushakov says he's suing the KGB.
   The former Soviet navy commander plans to haul his former
tormenters into court _ possibly before an international tribunal
in London _ to recover books, manuscripts and other documents
seized by KGB agents during a raid on his wife's apartment in
Odessa in 1984.
   Ushakov is seeking not only the return of his anti-communist
writings, but monetary damages for the emotional suffering he and
his wife, Irina, endured.

   A highly paid army of lobbyists and lawyers is
fighting one of the last battles of the Cold War, an intense
struggle to influence U.S. policy in the obscure African country of
Angola.
   It is one of the last skirmishes left for the United States and
Soviet Union. Neither is willing to abandon its allies in Angola,
but neither is either side willing to let the civil war there hold
up overall improvements in their relationship.
   While the Bush administration's approach is low key,
conservatives in Washington have adopted a highly visible stance.
   ``A key test of whether the Soviets have in fact changed their
imperial ambitions is Soviet behavior'' in Angola, according to a
half-page ad in The New York Times that was paid for by the
International Security Council, a conservative think tank.

   Ilona Nagy is all for democracy, but it
doesn't solve the problem of how to pay a $74 electricity bill and
still keep a family of six going on the rest of $300 a month.
   The monthly budget would be much smaller if she did not have a
second job. Her husband, Daniel, has left a secure government
position to form a private partnership, so his income is uncertain.
   ``You have to work out a strategy to survive,'' said Mrs. Nagy,
a 45-year-old folklore specialist at the Academy of Sciences who is
fluent in English and German. ``I work about 70 to 80 hours a
week.''
   Her monthly net salary of about $135, after 20 years at the
academy, illustrates how the former communist regime treated most
intellectuals who were not party members.
   A few intellectuals got into the bureaucracy, but most faced a
combination of punishment for dissent and pay lower than that of
blue-collar workers.
   Mrs. Nagy works as a part-time editor of folklore literature to
supplement the family income, and three of her four children take
odd jobs for pocket money. Two boys study at Budapest universities.
   More liberty has been a mixed blessing to the Nagys.
   With democracy has come greater inflation, now approaching a
yearly rate of 20 percent. Also, Mrs. Nagy often has visiting
mouths to feed because her husband is a Hungarian from
Transylvania, in neighboring Romania, and the revolution there has
given his relatives freedom to travel.
   ``In this situation, I can't care too much about politics, but
one has to think that things will be getting better after all,''
Mrs. Nagy told an interviewer in her Budapest apartment.
   ``I see the political changes as terribly interesting, but in
our everyday life the situation has not changed. You realize that,
with every month, the economic situation worsens.''
   Relatives arrive from Transylvania, in western Romania, in
groups of three or four, and stay for varying periods.
   ``Umpteen times it's been like this: The door bell rings and
outside are our Romanian relatives,'' Mrs. Nagy said. ``My first
thought always is: The fridge is empty, so is the purse, but I've
got to look after them.''
   Vacations have been only a dream to the Nagys for years, but now
even normal life is squeezed by price increases. The two-month
electricity bill just went up from to 4,600 florints, about $74,
from less than 3,000.
   Daniel Nagy earned the equivalent of $177 a month as a chemical
engineer for a state enterprise, but his wife said ``it's not clear
what his income will be'' from the new partnership.
   ``For a long time, I haven't bought a new dress,'' she said.
``Most everything we wear has been bought at a secondhand shop.
   ``To find something suitable there is fun, of a kind. It is also
interesting, because ... people who do their purchasing there are
very poor, those who have to eke out a living with very little
money.''
   Worsening economic conditions have impoverished one-fifth of
Hungary's 10.7 million people. Hungarians generally seem to feel
economic problems will be with them for a long time, whatever a new
democratic government does.
   Average monthly pay is the equivalent of $129, rent averages $16
a month and a pair of women's shoes costs $48. Milk is 32 cents a
liter (just over a quart), a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of butter is
$2.60 and a kilo of pork costs $4.
   Most price increases stemmed from the reduction or elimination
of subsidies and other cuts in public spending needed to qualify
for International Monetary Fund credits. Price hikes in January and
early February led to public protests and Budapest's first public
transport strike.

<HEAD>At the Tower of London, Armorers Preserve an Ancient Craft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Much lies behind the Tower of London's mustached
Beefeaters, cobblestone lanes and ravens, including Ted Smith and
son, armorers, who preserve an ancient craft from extinction.
   The two Royal Armory craftsmen and five assistants restore and
conserve the 40,000 pieces of armor in the Tower collection.
   Smith, 62, will retire in 1992 and is passing on his knowledge
of making and repairing armor to his 26-year-old son, Christopher.
   Behind a bright red door, away from the crown jewels and the 2
million tourists who flock to the 900-year-old Tower each year, the
Smiths work together on a replica of a knight's fighting helmet
made in northern Italy in 1460.
   Their one concession to modernity is a propane torch. All other
materials and methods are authentic to the time.
   Medieval armorers used cumbersome coal forges. A propane torch
makes it easier to work on those awkward lance-rests and chanfrons.
   ``We had a small forge for awhile, but it blew up a couple of
times and, with a gallery directly above us, it wouldn't have been
practical,'' Ted Smith explained.
   For the rounded helmet, which juts out at the back to protect
the neck, Ted Smith wields the torch while his son strikes on the
fire's bright orange stain with a large chisel. Their unprotected
faces redden as they lean over the hot metal.
   Chris Smith is logging their work and plans to publish an
illustrated guide to armor-making.
   Medieval armorers were too busy preparing knights for battle to
leave manuals for future generations. ``Armor died out and the
trade was never carried on,'' Ted Smith said.
   Because conservation work for the Royal Armory collection
intervenes, the Smiths need several months to finish a helmet, an
unacceptably long time by medieval standards.
   ``They would have been quicker because they were more skilled at
it,'' Ted Smith said. ``They made helmets all of the time, whereas
we can go five to 10 years without making a helmet.''
   The finished replicas get a hands-on and on-heads going over by
school children at educational demonstrations, Tower of London
spokeswoman Cathy Butler said.
   Chris Smith has long, curly hair; his father is balding and
wears glasses. Both have a mild affability and look, in their white
coats, more suited to a family drugstore than a medieval armor shop.
   Ted Smith went to work at the armory in 1949, after a time at
the Wilkinson sword company, and Chris joined him immediately after
graduating from school.
   They are proud of their heritage. Woodcuts of medieval armorers
hang on the workshop walls.
   An armorer was considered a top craftsman, Ted Smith said. ``He
would have worked for the king in the king's armory, or for a
nobleman,'' he said. ``The more you see, the more you appreciate
what they did, those old people.''
   ``They were damned good,'' said his son. ``We could never get
the skill here unless we did it for 40 years.''
   Besides the helmet, Chris Smith is assembling a 16th-century
Flemish suit of armor used for jousting. The lower left arm plate
came from the Philadelphia Museum of Art in exchange for a
chanfron, the armor that protects the horse's head.
   Exhibits in the Tower collection date from the arrival of
William the Conqueror in 1066. They include armor worn by several
English kings, among them Charles I, Charles II and James II.
   Also on show is the only surviving suit of armor for an
elephant, a trophy of Robert Clive when he defeated the French in
India in 1757.
   Constant restoration is needed because of air and dust corrosion
to items in the collection.
   The royal armorers spend a small portion of their time restoring
privately owned suits of armor sent in from ancestral homes.
   Fees are determined by the amount of work necessary.
   ``We stick to that rule, since I once told someone 100 pounds on
the phone and itrequired much more work,'' Chris Smith said.

<HEAD>Gridiron Dinner: Washington's Annual Bid at Deflating
Self-Importance</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a capital that takes itself very, very
seriously, there is a yearly ritual that cuts pomposity down a
notch. It happens in the speeches and the entertainment at a series
of formal dinners, none so formal and so venerable as the dinner of
the Gridiron Club.
   President Bush was there Saturday night, watching satirical
skits about his administration and the rest of the political
establishment, and recalling the observation of television
commentator David Brinkley that ``this city is nowhere near as
important as it thinks it is.''
   Bush joined in the jokes about the government he leads, and
about himself. He imitated the comics who mimic his sometimes
choppy semi-sentences: ``Lots of comedians up there _ doing
impersonations _ okay with me.
   ``Natural disasters _ out of bounds. California earthquake _ not
my fault. San Andreas fault.''
   The 105th of the white-tie Gridiron dinners featured such acts
as:
   _A walking stalk of broccoli seven feet tall, led on stage and
announced as room service for Bush.
   _ `The Alphabet Song,'' rewritten to lampoon Vice President Dan
Quayle:
   ``A, I', a-lectable,
   ``B, I'm bice president,
   ``C, Cocomo thinks I am swell...''
   _A song explaining why Senators Bill Bradley and Albert Gore,
and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo don't seem interested in running for
president in 1992:
   ``Now George Bush is kinder and he's gentle,
   ``Next to Ronald Reagan, almost mental,
   ``So our calculation's elemental,
   ``We cannot win it,
   ``So why get in it?''
   The Gridiron Club is an organization with 60 active members,
Washington-based reporters and editors for newspapers and wire
services. It has no noticeable purpose other than its fancy spring
dinner and satirical show. While irreverence is its mission, the
club itself is not immune from the pomposity it seeks each year to
puncture, warranting some self-satire.
   ``We know that gathered tonight are dozens of the most famous,
most influential, and most admired men and women in the nation,''
David S. Broder of the Washington Post, the club president, said
Saturday night. ``To say nothing of those who are here as our
guests.''
   Then he turned to Bush and praised the way the administration
ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. ``You lure him into this
place he thinks is safe ... cut him off from the outside world ...
you move in your people and block all the exits...
   ``And then, glory be, you bombard him for hours on end with
loud, bad music,'' Broder recounted. ``Hell, Mr. President, that's
a perfect description of the Gridiron dinner.''
   Bush knows the circuit, of course. At the black-tie dinner of
the Alfalfa Club in January, the president lamented, ``The evening
lasted so long I was about ready to call the papal nuncio to spring
me.'' The Alfalfa Club is an organization of 200 political and
business leaders who invite 300 guests to an annual stag dinner, at
which politicians make fun of themselves and each other.
   At this year's 77th dinner, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said Bush
had told him that dealing with Congress was like his fishing
expeditions _ ``hours of matching wits with tiny-brained creatures
with nothing to show for it.''
   Boren also said he was pessimistic about closing the trade gap
with Japan. ``It seems the only commodity the Japanese are
interested in buying is Ronald Reagan.''
   The former president's $2 million honorarium prompted a Gridiron
song, ``Easy Street,'' that began with a Reagan explanation:
   ``It was only a speech for Fujkisankei,
   ``A mere two million, a modest fee...''
   At the formal dinner of the Radio and Television Correspondents
Association last week, Bush joked about the phony telephone call he
took from a man claiming to be Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   ``Today I got him back,'' Bush said. ``Called him up and asked
if he had Prince Abdul in a can. But then I forgot to say `Let him
out' in Farsi.''
   At Saturday's affair, Bush needled his press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, about his weight, saying he had gone shopping. ``Marlin
said, `I'd like to see a bathing suit in my size,' and the clerk
said, `So would I.'''
   He also had a crack about the tough-guy reputation of his chief
of staff, John Sununu, saying that on a Latin American trip they
had to restrain him: ``Remember John, bite the taco, shake the
hand.''
   It all goes to the same point, and Bush made it, saying that the
lesson should not be about influence ``as much as deflating
self-importance.''

<HEAD>There's No Vast Wasteland in a Bahrain TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You get bombarded by commercials. You see steamy
scenes of amour. You're deluged by film-hawking celebrities. You've
got cable channels galore. But is ``L.A. Law'' ever interrupted by
a call to prayer?
   No. But this is American TV. And it can be bemusing to an
American returning home after years abroad, the last three in
Bahrain, that small island nation in the Persian Gulf just off the
coast of Saudi Arabia.
   Bahrain has oil wells, Rolls-Royces with gold-plated brightwork,
about half a million people _ and lots of desert. But compared to
what's on the tube in the U.S., television in that vast wasteland
is not a vast wasteland.
   Being in the center of the Islamic world, its TV programs are
regularly interrupted by the Moslem call to prayer. But prayer
never hurt a viewer.
   All the commercials and other-show promotions here can drive you
nuts. They can average 10.5 minutes of each prime time hour, and up
to 16 minutes of a daytime hour. You'd find instant relief in
Bahrain.
   The authorities there keep them to a merciful fraction of what
Americans regularly face.A good thing, too. The commercials on
television in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are even more boring than
those on U.S. networks.
   But the desert kind are shown only once or twice an evening,
three or four at a time during breaks between programs. And even
the most aggressive rug merchants do not advertise weekend
warehouse sales.
   For the returning expatriate, the biggest change in American
television is cable _ the explosion of channels devoted to sports,
movies, documentaries on everything from the Valdez oil spill to
the sex life of the newt.
   And, of course, there's news, 24 hours a day on the Cable News
Network.
   So how else has American television changed? Well, the hair of
J.R. Ewing has turned gray. Program credits flash by so fast that
even a speed-reader can't tell who did what. There's a greater
preoccupation with ``celebrities,'' no matter how dubious their
claims to fame.
   In prime time, there remains the old violence, the bang-bang.
But now there's a big difference in the dialogue: the shows have
real swear words in them.
   The sex stuff continues, although it's much racier now. And all
the hugging, necking and general messing around by the couples on
TV here is initially strange to see.
   It requires a bit of adjustment just to watch men and women
embracing and kissing each other. In the Middle East, Islamic
custom does not permit public displays of affection between the
sexes.
   Such scenes are excised from programs before they are shown.
Thus, a man may be about to plant a long, passionate kiss on his
beloved when ... poof!, he's suddenly shooting a cannon or jumping
up and down on a bad guy.
   But finer fare is available. Bahrain and Saudi stations choose
from some of the best TV available from around the world. Viewers
are able to see quality documentaries produced by the Public
Broadcasting System and a steady flow of BBC programs on
archaeology, Shakespeare and the arts.
   What does the returnee from Bahrain miss most, watching American
TV?
   Maybe the pomp and ritual of Arab kings, emirs and sheiks
welcoming or saying goodbye to each other at airports and palaces,
shots that begin every newscast in the Persian Gulf.
   Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather may start their
programs with graphics, music and earth-shaking news. But none of
it has the unique charm of Saudi TV's announcement that ``the
custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz, today
met with groups of citizens who came to greet him.''

   What is the greatest contribution government can
make to entrepreneurship?
   ``Keep out of the way and don't impede the work,'' says William
Dunkelberg.
   His response might seem flip, but it isn't. It is the considered
judgment of an economist, professor and business school dean who
has spent many hours analyzing the needs of small-business people.
   Dunkelberg, head of Temple University's School of Business and
Management, also advises the National Federation of Independent
Business, and in that role listens to hundreds of small-business
opinions each month.
   What he sees and hears is that small-business people have all
they can do just to remain solvent, not just because of competition
but because of government. To them, government has become
oppressive.
   To Dunkelberg, one of the amazing things about these amazing
people is that, left to do their jobs, they benefit everyone. They
provide jobs, fill marketplace needs and pay taxes. Their efforts
help support government.
   In some respects, government recognizes their efforts and
strives to help them. More often, in Dunkelberg's view, it imposes
burdens on them in the form of social programs and tax collectors,
jobs they aren't trained to do.
   ``Firms, especially small ones, are not efficient administrators
of social programs or tax collectors,'' he says. ``Firms are best
at producing goods and services.''
   When their time is diverted to paperwork, managing health care
programs, running child-care operations, providing health insurance
and the like, ``the less well they do at producing low-cost goods
and services.''
   Moreover, the added expenses might lower profits, and the
incomes of those who work at the entrepreneurial enterprise.
   That's almost everyone. Dunkelberg's figures indicate 90 percent
of all employers in the United States have 20 or fewer employees,
making them fit almost any definition of ``small business.''
   He explains: ``They do not have large pools of capital that they
have no use for. They are too small to efficiently deal with the
high fixed costs entailed when interfacing with government
regulations and programs.''
   Operating in very competitive environments, ``they must pass on
all of the costs of the programs to their customers or shrink their
operations.''
   Dunkelberg's comments were provoked by what he sees as a
legislative state of mind arising from the tightness of federal,
state and local budgets, and which seeks to slough off on business
what government can't afford itself.
   It's no answer, he says. Conceivably, it could even worsen
matters by overburdening the small business.
   From surveys Dunkelberg has conducted, come these findings:
   _When asked to compare the reality with expectations in starting
a company, half said they underestimated how difficult government
regulations and red tape would be.
   _Only 25 percent underestimated the problems associated with
developing sales, managing workers or financing operations.
   _A mere 10 percent or so said they underestimated the problems
presented by the competition.
   Based on his findings, Dunkelberg has this message for state
governments: ``Each law and regulation must be carefully examined
for its tax consequences for entrepreneurship.''
   Pressed by government requirements, he says, small businesses
can seek greater efficiency, raise prices, cheapen the product, cut
the payroll or go out of business. In all, not a pleasant array of
choices.
   He points out that more positively, government is in an
excellent position to effectively develop:
   _A better infrastructure to lower commuting and transportation
costs, for example.
   _Better workforce quality through education and training.
   _Information and networking capabilities that make it easier for
new firms to overcome the hurdles they face.
   Too often, however, businesses are viewed by government as a
mechanism for new social programs or greater revenues, Dunkelberg
says, and with such a mindset it threatens the possibilities of
both.
   He concludes:
   ``We can seriously damage the incentives faced by individuals
who have the creative power not only to improve their own economic
situation, but also that of millions of others for whom these
entrepreneurs create jobs and wealth.''

<BYLINE>Veterans, Statesmen To Gather at Gallipoli for 75th Anniverary
^By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At dawn on April 25, 1915, Allied soldiers
waded onto the Gallipoli Peninsula in an invasion that would cost
hundreds of thousands of lives and end in failure.
   Seventy-five years later, veterans of the campaign, government
oficials and tourists will come from as far as Australia and New
Zealand for a commemoration some Turks liken to a second invasion.
   All hotels and boarding houses have been fully booked for
months, said Muzaffer Ecemis, governor of Canakkale province, which
includes the Dardanelles Strait and the peninsula north of it.
   Visiting dignitaries will be housed on a cruise ship. They
include Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the prime
minister and defense minister of Australia, New Zealand's governor
general and delegations from France and West Germany.
   Two Australian warships and a submarine set out from Sydney.
France and Britain also are sending two warships each, with
military bands and honor guards.
   In World War I, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was allied with
Germany and Austria against Britain, its dominions, France and
Russia.
   About 70 veterans of Gallipoli, aged 91 to 103, will be the most
honored guests.
   Australian newspaper reports said one veteran, John McCleery of
Perth, planned to celebrate his 103rd birthday at ``ANZAC Cove,''
the place where Australian and New Zealand soldiers landed on his
28th birthday.
   The object of the Gallipoli campaign, which military historians
call the first combined naval and land operation of modern warfare,
was to open the Turkish straits to Russia; capture Istanbul, then
known as Constantinople in the West; and take the Ottoman Empire
out of the war.
   An Allied naval effort to break through the Dardanelles, the
ancient Hellespont, had been halted after the loss of three
battleships.
   Turks held their own victory celebrations March 18 to mark the
end of that battle, when they stopped the British navy from
reaching the Marmara Sea.
   Gallipoli then became a battleground for nine months, until the
invading forces were evacuated in December 1915 and January 1916.
   Half a million soldiers from Britain, France, Australia, New
Zealand and India fought on the peninsula and more than half became
casualties, including 55,000 killed in battle, 10,000 listed as
missing and 21,000 who died of disease, mainly dysentary.
   An equal number of Turks were sent into battle. Estimates are
that half were killed.
   Historians still debate the mistakes made and opportunities
missed by both sides.
   Some say an Allied victory would have shortened the long, costly
war by two or three years and prevented or delayed the Bolshevik
revolution in Russia.
   It was the only victory for the Turks in World War I and
provided the self-confidence they needed to salvage a nation from
the dismembered empire.
   The battle also gave them a modern hero, Kemal Ataturk, who made
his name as a military genius in Gallipoli. He later established
Turkey, a predominantly Moslem country, as a secular republic with
Western-style laws.
   Australians celebrate each April 25 as a national holiday.
Gallipoli was their first appearance on the global scene, and
historians say it gave them a sense of pride and nationhood.
   Britain and France now are allied with Turkey in NATO, and
Australia is a valued trading partner. Thousands of Turks have
emigrated to Australia.
   Huseyin Goseler, a Turk, and Jane Urwin, an Australian, will
join the celebrations by getting married April 25 at an old
fortress that overlooks the Dardanelles from the hills of
Gallipoli, they said in a telephone interview.
   Just in time to serve the visitors, they and another Australian
have opened Bob's Burger Pub, named for Bob Hawke, prime minister
of Australia.

   When the U.S. Supreme Court was established 200
years ago, its powers under the Constitution were only loosely
defined. So perhaps it was inevitable that the court would reflect
the nation's politics, the social trends of the times. Here's a
look at how that came about.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Of all the institutions that have shaped
America over the two centuries since its birth, shaped its
political, social and even its cultural face, perhaps the most
influential sculptor has been the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Now the court goes into its third century pondering issues never
dreamed of by the framers of the Constitution, ruling on such
matters as burning the flag, abortion and affirmative action.
   They are legal issues, to be sure, but they are also political
and social issues.
   The court, in the words of one scholar, has become ``a barometer
of political and social change.'' And in the words of historian
Samuel Eliot Morison, ``the keystone in the federal arch.''
   It was perhaps unavoidable that the nation's highest tribunal
would reflect national politics.
   In one of the first cases to be argued before the court,
Attorney General Edmund Randolph said, ``With this discussion,
though purely legal, it will be impossible to prevent the world
from blending political considerations.''
   Randolph spoke his words on Aug. 11, 1792, in the court's third
year, as the justices considered whether a state could be sued by
an individual who lived in another state.
   At that time the court had five justices who held court in the
Philadelphia City Hall. Now the court, which observed the 200th
anniversary of its first sitting on Feb. 1, has nine justices. It
meets in a three-story marble building on Capitol Hill.
   Without question it has a mystique about it.
   ``Most people have a sort of a reverent eye about the Supreme
Court,'' says civil rights attorney William M. Kunstler, a harsh
critic of the institution. ``They go into that building with the
carpets and the columns and the awe-inspiring aspect of it, and
they say, `Oh, my God! It's the fount of all knowledge!'''
   Hollywood has mirrored this view. In the 1942 comedy, ``The Talk
of the Town,'' Ronald Colman plays a small-town lawyer who is named
to a seat on the high court. Every time the subject comes up,
massed violins strike up a soaring melody.
   Richard Nixon, running against Democrat Hubert Humphrey in 1968,
campaigned against the mystique as he promised to nominate
law-and-order justices if elected president.
   ``Whenever I begin to discuss the Supreme Court, Mr. Humphrey
acts like we're in church,'' Nixon complained.
   More recently, President Reagan charged liberals with
politicizing the court in their successful battle against his
nomination of conservative Robert H. Bork to its bench in 1987.
   Many jurists, scholars and lawyers, however, say that whatever
the issue, whatever the setting, the court cannot get away from
political currents.
   ``The Supreme Court has never been above politics,'' says
historian Frank Freidel, professor emeritus at Harvard and the
University of Washington.
   ``I think the court inevitably reflects the social and political
trends of the age we live in,'' says A.E. Howard, professor of law
at the University of Virginia and a Supreme Court authority. ``Much
of what the court does is a barometer of political and social
change.''
   ``It is totally political,'' says Kunstler. ``To pretend it is
not is to delude the American people.''
   The turn-of-the century humorist Finley Peter Dunne, speaking
through his Irish immigrant character Mr. Dooley, put the sentiment
into dialect, saying ``th' supreme coort follows th' iliction
returns.''
   Even Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in a 1986 speech at
Suffolk University School of Law, said, ``Judges, so long as they
are relatively normal human beings, can no more escape being
influenced by public opinion in the long run than can people
working at other jobs.''
   The Constitution merely says, ``The judicial power of the United
States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior
courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.''
   The Constitution says little about the Supreme Court's powers,
only that it will hear appeals and will have original jurisdiction
over some limited categories of cases. It does not say how many
justices there should be. Congress set the number at six, then
changed it to five, six again, seven, nine, seven again and then
nine again.
   In its early days, the court was by no means the prestigious
institution it later became. George Washington, recruiting
potential nominees for the new tribunal, got several turndowns.
John Jay, the first chief justice, resigned to run for governor of
New York. Others also left to take other jobs.
   After the appointment of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1801,
the court loomed larger. It is the bust of the third chief justice,
not Jay's, that is on the bicentennial postage stamp. It is also
his name that is associated with the court's first great milestone.
   The power of the Supreme Court to strike down laws by ruling
they are unconstitutional is so much a part of American life that
it is easy to forget it was not always taken for granted. The
Constitution says nothing about it. George Washington believed the
president would exercise this power, through his veto. But as it
turned out, presidents used the veto as an instrument of policy
instead.
   Then, President John Adams tried to make one William Marbury a
``midnight judge'' by giving him a justice of the peace appointment
just before leaving office.
   In 1803, Marshall, writing for a unanimous court, struck down
the law under which Marbury sued to force the new Jefferson
administration to honor the appointment. There would be no reason
to have the powers of Congress limited in the Constitution ``if
these limits may, at any time, be passed,'' the chief justice said.
He said it was up to the courts ``to say what the law is.'' Marbury
never got to be a justice of the peace.
   The court did not again rule a law unconstitutional for more
than half a century, but when it did it added fuel to the
smoldering controversy that would blaze into Civil War.
   Dred Scott was the black slave of an Army surgeon's widow in St.
Louis, and Missouri was a slave state. Before the surgeon died,
however, he had taken Scott with him to Army posts in Illinois and
what is now Minnesota. Scott sued for his freedom on grounds he had
lived for years in a free state and territory. He lost in Missouri
courts and in a federal circuit court. Then the case went to the
Supreme Court, which had a southern majority and was headed by
pro-slavery Chief Justice Roger B. Taney.

   In 1857, the court ruled that Congress had exceeded its
constitutional powers in adopting the Missouri Compromise
prohibiting slavery in some territories. Scott was freed by his
owner anyway, but died of consumption a year later.
   The court was so vilified in the North that a later chief
justice, Charles Evans Hughes, described the ruling as a
``self-inflicted wound.''
   Abraham Lincoln, taking office as president in 1861,
acknowledged that the rulings of the court were ``entitled to very
high respect and consideration'' but added that ``if the policy of
the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is
to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the
instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties to
personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own
rulers.''
   Despite Lincoln's words, the court continued to decide ordinary
litigation between parties and in the process set national policy.
   ``Most presidents at one time or another have made some
statement like that,'' Howard says. ``Whenever the executive branch
has been threatened by the court, they immediately invoke
democracy.''
   Take Andrew Jackson.
   The Marshall court ruled in 1832 that two missionaries had been
wrongly convicted and imprisoned by the state of Georgia for living
among the Cherokee Indians.
   ``John Marshall has made his decision: now let him enforce it!''
said President Jackson.
   Marshall could do no such thing, and the missionaries languished
in prison for years.
   In ``The Federalist Papers,'' Alexander Hamilton wrote that the
judiciary ``has no influence over either the sword or the purse ..
. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely
judgment.''
   Merely judgment.
   _A judgment in 1896 that separate railroad cars for blacks were
not discriminatory as long as the facilities were equal,
establishing a standard for treatment of the races that stood for
more than half a century.
   _A judgment in 1905 that laws limiting the work week for men
were ``mere meddlesome interferences with the rights of the
individual,'' a standard that would give way as the court later
approved wage-and-hour laws.
   _A judgment in 1952 that President Truman exceeded his authority
in seizing struck steel mills.
   _A judgment in 1954 outlawing school segregation, ruling that
the separate-but-equal doctrine had no place in public education.
   _A judgment in 1973 striking down restrictive abortion laws in
46 states.
   _A judgment in 1974 that President Nixon must surrender
Watergate tapes sought by a special prosecutor.
   _A judgment in 1989 striking down a law against desecrating the
American flag.
   ``We have seen a shift from structural questions like federalism
to social issues like abortion,'' Howard says. ``I think the court
has registered another significant political change and that is the
vast sweep of government. The more government does the more
opportunities there are for people to complain.''
   In the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt, frustrated by a
string of decisions striking down New Deal programs, sought
legislation enabling him to pack the Supreme Court by appointing a
new judge for every one who reached age 70. It was his most
stunning defeat.
   ``It made him look like a dictator,'' says Freidel, author of a
new one-volume biography, ``Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Rendezvous
with Destiny,'' and an earlier four-volume study of Roosevelt.
``That was a terrible thing to look like in 1937, with Hitler and
Mussolini rampant in Europe.''
   As it turned out, the court-packing plan was unnecessary.
Between 1937 and 1940, resignations created five vacancies, and FDR
had a ``Roosevelt Court'' that upheld New Deal legislation.
   President Eisenhower's appointment of Earl Warren as chief
justice in 1953 ushered in an era of judicial activism, including
the school desegregation decisions, the 1963 ruling against
mandatory prayer in public schools, a ruling the same year that all
criminal defendants must have counsel, and the ``one man, one
vote'' rule on congressional reapportionment in 1964.
   ``All governments, including Supreme Courts, are influenced
directly by what's happening in the streets of the country,'' says
civil libertarian Kunstler. ``During the Warren era you had the
pressures that came from the streets of Birmingham and other
places, Martin Luther King and so on, that forced the court to do
right.''
   President Nixon's appointment of Warren Burger as chief justice
in 1969 and his subsequent naming of three associate justices
ushered in a more conservative era that has continued under
Rehnquist.
   In decisions this year, the court has ruled that prison
officials may force mentally ill inmates to take anti-psychotic
drugs, has broadened the power of police to conduct searches after
making arrests in private homes and has upheld a type of death
penalty law in effect in 14 states.
   ``I regard the Supreme Court as an enemy, not a friend, and I
think it has to be treated as an enemy now,'' says Kunstler, who
has argued the flag burning case among others in the high court.
``It should be picketed. It should be attacked in every way
possible because it is not a harbinger of good will and human
rights and equal rights and liberties for all.''
   Howard, however, thinks the panel does a pretty good job of
living up to the motto over its front door: ``Equal Justice Under
Law.''
   ``I think by and large it does,'' he said in an interview. ``I
suspect it is a more evenhanded court than it might have been in an
earlier age.''
   Of the present members of the court, William J. Brennan was
appointed by Eisenhower, Byron White by John F. Kennedy, Thurgood
Marshall by Lyndon Johnson, Rehnquist and Harry Blackmun by Nixon,
John Paul Stevens by Gerald Ford, and Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia and Anthony Kennedy by Reagan. Reagan elevated Rehnquist to
chief justice.
   Eight of the last 29 justices had political careers before going
on the bench, but the trend in recent years has been to nominate
people with judicial experience. Seven of the present nine
justices, all but Rehnquist and White, were judges on lower
appellate courts when appointed.
   Howard said he found this ``troublesome.''
   ``I think when Hugo Black came from the Senate and William O.
Douglas from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Earl Warren
from California politics, they brought a dimension that an
appellate judge simply does not,'' the Virginia law professor said.
``I would like some of the nine to have been judges, but not all
nine.
   ``I think it should be political in the broad sense. It is a
place where policy is made, for better or worse, and therefore it
should be tested by how people feel about it. But it ought not to
be political in immediate or partisan terms. I think it is proper
that once a justice is on the court he is frequently an ingrate to
the president who put him there.''

   Hugo L. Black had the rare privilege of
speaking for the Supreme Court on March 18, 1963, when it
unanimously reversed itself and decided he had been right all along.
   Twenty-one years earlier, Black had led a band of three
dissenters as the court ruled the Constitution did not require
states to provide counsel for criminal defendants who were too poor
to hire their own lawyers.
   Now the court was considering the case of Clarence Earl Gideon,
convicted in a Florida court of breaking into a poolroom. He was
sentenced to five years in prison.
   Gideon told the judge he was entitled to a lawyer. The judge and
the Florida Supreme Court both turned him down.
   The situation, said Black, was ``strikingly like'' the 1942
case, in which an unemployed Maryland farmhand, denied a lawyer,
was convicted of robbery.
   In that case, the high court ruled the appointment of counsel
was not ``a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial.''
   Now, with all of his colleagues on his side, Black's decision
ruled that Gideon was indeed entitled to a lawyer.
   ``The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be
deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries,
but it is in ours,'' he said.
   Black's triumph was a dramatic demonstration of the power of
dissent _ a power that often has seen the minority opinion become
the majority opinion as time passes.
   One of the most famous dissents in the court's history was that
of John Marshall Harlan in a Louisiana railroad case in 1896 that
established the rule of ``separate but equal'' facilities for the
races.
   ``Our Constitution is colorblind, and neither knows nor
tolerates classes among citizens,'' Harlan said. ``In respect of
civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law.''
   He was the lone dissenter.
   In 1954, however, the court unanimously ruled the ``separate but
equal'' doctrine was unconstitutional discrimination against black
children because ``separate education facilities are inherently
unequal.''
   Often, more than one justice files a dissenting opinion. In the
court's 1986 term, for example, there were 156 dissents, exactly
the number of cases the court decided on the merits, although 41 of
the court's decisions were unanimous.
   Most of the dissents attract little attention. In some of the
more famous ones:
   _Justice Louis D. Brandeis pioneered the theory, now widely
accepted, of a constitutional right to privacy.
   _Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. warned against ``attempts to
check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be
fraught with death.''
   _Justice William O. Douglas inveighed against loyalty-security
hearings in which ``faceless people are allowed to present their
whispered rumors and yet escape the test and torture of
cross-examination.''
   Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes summed up the case for the
dissenters this way:
   ``A dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the
brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day,
when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the
dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed.''

   As it moves toward a plebiscite on statehood
next year, Puerto Rico has an image problem. Many feel that
prejudices against Puerto Ricans might dampen any enthusiasm in the
U.S. Congress for the island to become the 51st state. Here then is
a look at the gentler side of Puerto Rico, a centuries-old culture
rich in art, music and tradition.

   One image of Puerto Ricans emerges
from the graffiti-sprayed tenements of Brooklyn and the Bronx,
where poverty breeds street gangs, drug dealers and welfare
dependence.
   But 1,600 miles away, on the Caribbean island that generations
of poor, uneducated Puerto Ricans have fled, you can find the Other
Puerto Rico.
   The Other Puerto Rico is:
   _Old San Juan, a walled city founded by the explorer Juan Ponce
de Leon in the 1500s, with narrow, cobbled streets and
pastel-painted colonial mansions.
   _The Casals Festival, an annual series of classical music
concerts started by the legendary Spanish cellist Pablo Casals.
   _And the Ponce Museum of Art, which boasts one of the most
extensive collections of Italian baroque paintings in the Americas.
   The Other Puerto Rico is the novels of Manuel Zeno-Gandia and
Luis Rafael Sanchez, the plays of Rene Marques, the paintings of
Rafael Tufino and Lorenzo Homar and the all-Puerto Rican movie ``Lo
Que Le Paso a Santiago (Santiago: What Happened to His New Life),''
nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign-language film of
1989.
   It is the tropical beat of salsa and merengue, the minstrel folk
tales of the ``jibaro'' mountain farmer, religious wood carvings of
saints known as ``santos,'' four-stringed ``cuatro'' guitars and
papier-mache carnival masks with multiple devil horns.
   It is a Saturday night concert by the Puerto Rico Symphony
Orchestra in the 3,000-seat Performing Arts Center and a Sunday
afternoon guitar recital in La Casa del Libro (The Book House), a
little-known museum of ancient manuscripts in Old San Juan.
   It is what artist Katherine Harman Harding, who does abstract
watercolors and collages, found soon after arriving a year ago from
Indianapolis.
   ``I moved here from the Midwest, and I see more art, more
progressive art, done here than there, including Chicago,'' she
says.
   ``I'm finding it to be an amazing place.''
   Ricardo Alegria, director of the Center for Advanced Studies of
Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, which is housed in a beautifully
restored 16th century convent in Old San Juan, regards
Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico, at least in cultural terms, as a
separate and older country than the United States.
   ``Puerto Rico was already a country with Greco-Roman roots two
centuries before the United States,'' he says.
   Still, the Other Puerto Rico exists alongside the Caribbean
island's helter-skelter commercial development, widespread poverty
and high levels of drug-related crime and AIDS among 3.3 million
people crowded onto an area only 100 miles long by 35 miles wide.
   Moreover, the island's image is blurred by ``West Side Story''
stereotypes of the 2.5 million Puerto Ricans living in the
crumbling urban barrios of the United States.
   ```West Side Story' was a beautiful musical but a very bad thing
for Puerto Rico because it gave the wrong impression of Puerto
Rico,'' says former Gov. Luis Ferre, the 86-year-old father of
Puerto Rico's statehood movement and multimillionaire benefactor of
the impressive Ponce Museum of Art in the southern coastal city of
Ponce, his birthplace.
   With the island planning a plebiscite in 1991 on whether to
remain a U.S. commonwealth, form an independent nation or become
the 51st state, some feel prejudices against Puerto Ricans could
dampen any enthusiasm for statehood in the U.S. Congress.
   ``Sure, it's a problem for us,'' says former Gov. Carlos Romero
Barcelo, leader of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. ``It's
a problem for Mississippi, the image the nation has of
Mississippi.''
   He says polls have shown two-thirds of Americans would be
willing to accept Puerto Rico as a state if the island favored it.
But if Puerto Ricans wanted independence, 80 percent say they would
accept that.
   ``There's an underlying prejudice somewhere there,'' he says.
   Puerto Ricans, of course, have distinguished themselves in many
fields in the United States _ singer Jose Feliciano, film stars
Raul Julia and Rita Moreno, baseball's late Roberto Clemente and
surgeon general-designate Antonia Novello, to name a few.

   Christopher Columbus discovered
Puerto Rico on Nov. 14, 1493. At the time, the Caribbean island was
inhabited by aboriginal Taino Indians, who called their land
Borinquen.
   Columbus' companion, Juan Ponce de Leon, seeker of the mythical
Fountain of Perpetual Youth, established the first Spanish
settlement near San Juan Harbor in 1508.
   Spain imported African slaves to work sugar plantations and used
Puerto Rico as a way station for gold-laden ships from Mexico to
stock up on provisions before continuing their voyage to Spain.
   In 1898, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, along with Guam and the
Philippines, to the United States at the end of the
Spanish-American War, which was fought to liberate Cuba from
Spanish rule.
   Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens in 1917 and elected a
governor for the first time in 1948.
   The island became a U.S. commonwealth in 1952. The status,
ratified by referendum in 1967, gives Puerto Ricans most rights and
benefits of citizenship. But they pay no federal taxes and cannot
vote for U.S. president. Puerto Rico is represented in Congress by
one non-voting delegate.
   Congress is now considering the island's proposal for a
plebiscite in June 1991 on whether to remain a commonwealth with
increased autonomy, form an independent nation or become the 51st
state.
   Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States has been
marred by occasional pro-independence violence.

   As dinosaurs go, they were the biggest of the
big. They lived in a region that is now the Rocky Mountains, no
dwarfs themselves when it comes to hills. And it's in those
mountains that their bones are interred, offering today's
scientists valuable clues to the history of life.

   For more than a century, scientists have been
digging into a vast dinosaur graveyard in the Rocky Mountains,
unraveling the mysteries of the largest creatures ever to roam the
planet.
   Here lie the fossilized bones of dinosaurs that lived 140
million years ago when the Front Range was a great semi-arid
lowland with periods of rain and drought. Colorado was a flat
landscape with large meandering streams, vegetation and open spaces.
   Man was still 138 million years away.
   Called the Morrison Formation for a small town southwest of
Denver where the first dinosaur skeleton was found here in 1877,
the graveyard lies on either side of the Rocky Mountains from Idaho
south to New Mexico.
   Paleontologists call it ``the capital of dinosaur research.''
   In January, a Colorado expedition found a jaw and vertebrae
fragments west of Fort Collins that belonged to the rare,
meat-gulping hunter epanterias.
   Robert Bakker, a University of Colorado paleontologist who led
that team, says people weren't interested in dinosaurs before the
1877 discovery because they didn't know much about them. He said
that before the Colorado find there were ``miserable fragments'' of
fossils from Europe.
   ``The Morrison finds really put American science on the map and
continues to surprise us every field season,'' says Bakker, who has
been working on the formation since 1974.
   A group of preservation-minded people in Colorado has organized
``Friends of Dinosaur Ridge'' and is working with local and state
officials on a project to protect a famous Morrison Formation
outcropping southwest of Denver.
   The group has proposed a park a mile long and 200 feet wide. It
would lie on the first ridge _ a ``hogback'' _ west of Lakewood,
Colo., a Denver suburb. If the proposal is approved, Colorado
Highway 26 would be closed from Rooney Road to Colorado 93.
   Joe Tempel, environmental manager for the state highway
department, described the proposed Dinosaur Ridge Park as an
outdoor education laboratory, a ``hands-on science, ecology,
natural history park.''
   The most extensive collection of Morrison dinosaur fossils are
housed in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   ``The Morrison gives us the best picture of the really big
dinosaurs that lived in the age of dinosaurs,'' says David Burman,
curator of vertebrae fossils at the Carnegie. ``Because of the
nature of the environment it represented it has preserved more and
better specimens of any formation in any period.''
   Scientists credit the Rocky Mountains with allowing them to
study the dinosaur fossils. As the earth's crust rose and
contorted, erosion exposed layers of sandstone, limestone and
shale. The layers display the fossilized bones, footprints and
environment of the Jurassic Period.
   The Jurassic, a time from 205 million years to 130 million years
ago, is considered the second geological period in the age of
dinosaurs. The Morrison Formation appeared in the Upper Jurassic
period, 140 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were at their
largest.
   The Morrison Formation is ``part of one of the most complete
records of the history of life you can find,'' says Dr. Richard
Stucky, paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Natural History.
``There are episodes missing in the Rocky Mountains, but we do have
a fairly complete record.''
   In 1877, the dinosaur graveyard was discovered by visiting
scientists who found an apatosaurus and a stegosaurus near
Morrison. That find was quickly followed by the discovery of an
allosaurus and a camarasaurus north of Canon City, and dozens of
dinosaurs north of Laramie, Wyo. Those discoveries kicked off a
kind of ``fossil gold rush'' that continues today.
   There are dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era. Among them
are movements of the Earth, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes
in the climate, meteorites and even extraterrestrial hunters.
   Bakker believes dinosaurs became extinct because of worldwide
diseases that turned into an ``eptimological nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he says.
   Big animals travel and are very vulnerable to disease, Bakker
says. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the animals
would move, spreading all the hundreds of diseases throughout all
the herds on all continents _ eventually killing the lot.
   Most of the Carnegie collection of fossils came from what is now
Dinosaur National Monument, on the northwestern Colorado-Utah
border in Moffat County, Colo. Scientists took 750,000 pounds of
crated dinosaurs from the quarries.
   The expedition brought ``the best apatosaurus, a top-notch
diplodocus, a teen-age camarasaurus and the most complete
sauropod,'' Burman says.
   The first dinosaur at the museum was the diplodocus, found at
Sheep Creek, Wyo., which Burman says is one of the most famous in
the world. Plaster casts have been made and shipped to Germany,
France, Argentina, Spain and Portugal.
   ``One of the first plaster casts was shipped to the British
Museum at a time when these big fossils were relatively new, so
they created quite a stir in Europe,'' Burman says. ``Newspapers
carried headlines that read `Dippy Comes to England.'''
   The original diplodocus is still in the Carnegie Museum. But
Pittsburgh is not the only place to see such giants.
   ``In terms of seeing big dinosaurs before your eyes, you won't
see anything like the Morrison Formation in the world,'' Burman
says. ``It gives people a look at how the dinosaurs occur in the
rock.''

   Fossils of some of the dinosaurs that have been
found in the Morrison Formation include:
   _Apatosaurus: Popularly known as the brontosaurus, one of the
best-known dinosaurs. The 70-foot-long creature had a heavy body
and legs and a long neck and tail.
   _Diplodocus: Ninety feet long with most of the length from the
long, thin neck and long, whip-like tail. Its name, which means
``double beam,'' describes a special feature of the backbone, a
piece of small bone that pointed forward as well as the normal
piece that pointed back.
   _Stegosaurus: Had a tiny, tubular skull with a brain the size of
a walnut. It had small, flat plates on its neck and bigger
diamond-shaped plates on its back and the first part of its tail.
It grew up to 30 feet long.
   _Allosaurus: The largest carnivore in North America in the late
Jurassic Period. It may have fed on other well-known dinosaurs. It
was different from other meat-eating dinosaurs in the shape of its
skull, which had a ridge along the top that ran from between the
eyes to the tip of the snout. It was 35 feet long.
   _Camarasaurus: A heavily built suaropod with a shorter tail and
neck than the apatosaurus or diplodocus. Its head was short with a
blunt snout, and its nostrils were on the top of its head. Those
features have led scientists to believe it could have lived in
water. It generally grew to 60 feet long.

   The tombstones tell the story, a litany of all
of America's wars and the men who fought in them. It's not so large
as Arlington National Cemetery, but the small burial ground at the
West Point Military Academy is unmatched in its historical scope.

<TEXT>
   A small cemetery overlooking the Hudson
River is hallowed ground for America's fighting men.
   The modest U.S. Military Academy's Post Cemetery is probably the
only burial ground that holds the graves of soldiers who fought in
every war from the Revolution to Vietnam.
   There are soldiers buried here who were killed by arrows, musket
balls, Viet Cong ambush and space capsule fires. Fifteen are Medal
of Honor winners.
   The 420-acre, 60,000-grave Arlington National Cemetery may be
more expansive and the battlefield cemetery at Gettysburg may
reflect the terrible toll of a single battle.
   But there is unmatched history and glory preserved in the
14-acre West Point cemetery, where American soldiers were being
buried 82 years before the first soldier was interred at Arlington.
   James M. Gavin, a famed and much-decorated World War II general,
was the most recent war hero to be buried here.
   Gavin, who led American paratroopers in the D-Day invasion of
Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and aerial attacks on Nazi-held
Holland, was buried in late February with full military honors,
including an honor guard from his old outfit, the 82nd Airborne
Division.
   Gavin lies alongside such American soldiers as George Armstrong
Custer, the legendary Indian fighter killed on June 25, 1876, along
with 200 soldiers of the 7th Cavalry in the Battle of the Little
Big Horn; Gen. Winfield Scott, hero from the War of 1812 and the
commander of Union forces at the opening of the Civil War; Robert
Anderson, who defended Fort Sumter in the opening battle of the
Civil War; and astronaut Edward White, the first American to walk
in space, who died during a flash fire aboard the Apollo I space
capsule.
   ``Certainly it's got to be the most varied and comprehensive
military cemetery in the nation,'' says Stephen Grove, the academy
historian. ``With unknown soldiers from the Revolution, and people
like Gavin and Custer, it has tremendous variety and diversity.
   ``Outside of Arlington it has the most distinguished collection
of military people in the United States in one spot. It has
tremendous solemnness. Walking through the cemetery is like going
through pages of history. You come across name after name of people
you've read about.''
   The oldest grave at the cemetery belongs to Dominick Trant, a
Revolutionary War soldier who died at the fort in 1782.
   During the Revolutionary War, West Point was a crucial outpost
because it controlled traffic on the Hudson River north of New York
City. George Washington warned that the British could split the
Colonies and win the war quickly if they captured West Point. It
was West Point that Benedict Arnold plotted to turn over to the
British when he betrayed the American cause.
   With all its history and tradition, being buried at West Point
is a high honor for officers who graduated from the Military
Academy. Gavin, who called West Point his ``spartan mother,'' chose
the post cemetery over Arlington as his burial place.
   ``I think most of the family would have preferred that he be
buried at Arlington, but it was always his desire to be buried at
West Point,'' says Gavin's nephew, Col. Barrie E. Zais, who also
graduated from the Military Academy. ``He was very close to West
Point.''
   Burial is limited to West Point graduates, soldiers serving at
the academy post at the time of their death, and their immediate
family members.

   Among the war heroes buried at West Point are:
   _Daniel Butterfield, the Civil War general credited with
composing the traditional ``Taps'' bugle call in July 1862 to honor
his fallen soldiers in the Seven Days Battle.
   _David Marcus, a 1924 West Point graduate, who was one of the
founders of the modern Israeli army. Marcus served as the supreme
commander of the Jewish Force-Jerusalem area after World War II and
is buried beneath a pink granite tombstone imported from Israel.
   _Maj. Gen. George Sykes and Maj. Gen. John Buford Jr., who both
commanded Union troops at the Battle of Gettysburg.
   _Lucius Clay, the Army general who directed the Berlin airlift
in the early 1960s and later served as President Kennedy's
ambassador to West Germany.
   _Dennis Mahan Michie, class of 1892, Army's first football coach
and captain of the team, who was killed in Cuba during the
Spanish-American War.
   _Martin Mayer, the technical sergeant who taught physical
education at the military academy for a half-century and became the
subject of the movie classic ``The Long Gray Line.''
   _Paul Bunker, class of 1903, who was the only Army football
player to be proclaimed All America at two different positions.
Bunker rose to the rank of colonel and died in a Japanese POW camp
during World War II.
   _Maj. Gen. Robert L. Howze, who won a Medal of Honor for his
heroics fighting Sioux Indians in 1891.
   _Margaret ``Captain Molly'' Corbin, who took over a cannon after
her husband was mortally wounded during Battle of Fort Washington
in the Revolutionary War.
   The epitaphs provide fascinating and powerful historical
footnotes.
   The story of Thomas Selfridge, the nation's first military pilot
to die in a plane crash, is told on one tombstone. Selfridge ``gave
up his life in the service of his country at Fort Myer, Va., Sept.
17, 1908 in falling with the first government aeroplane.''
   Selfridge, a 26-year-old first lieutenant, was experimenting
with Orville Wright at the time. Selfridge Air Force Base in
Michigan is named after him.
   Walter Schulze's tragic story is told on his tombstone. Schulze,
the 138th ``aero squadron'' captain was killed on June 28, 1919, in
a plane crash in Germany as he was returning from delivering word
to the American troops east of the Rhine River that World War I had
officially ended.
   One tombstone with Chinese characters stands over the grave of
Ying-hsing Wen, a 1909 West Point graduate who went on to be a
lieutenant general in the Chinese Army.
   One of the most poignant tombstones stands over the grave shared
by 1st Lt. John A. Fera, class of 1966, who was killed two years
later in Vietnam, and his father, Maj. Milo A. Fera, who served in
World War II and Korea.
   The cost of the Vietnam War is eloquently told in row after row
of white marble tombstones in the newest section of the cemetery.
   The first of 274 West Point graduates to die in Vietnam, William
Frew Train III, is buried at the cemetery. According to the
epitaph, Train was killed in an ambush on June 16, 1962.
   A few paces away, tombstone after tombstone tells the toll of
Vietnam on a generation:
   Donald Francis VanCook Jr., graduated 1968, killed in action
1969. William F. Little III, graduated 1968, killed in action 1969.
James A. Gaiser, graduated 1968, killed in action 1969. Robert F.
Serio Jr., graduated 1964, killed in action 1968. Harry L. Thain,
graduated 1969, killed in action 1972. Raymond J. Enners, graduated
1967, killed in action 1968. Frank G. Oliver II graduated 1969,
killed in action 1972. Charles Hemingway, graduated 1965, killed in
action 1967.

   By day, this is a quiet little town

eat barbecued brisket and laze around sipping cool drinks.
   After dark is when the place comes alive, and you have to think
old Henry Gruene would approve.
   After dark, local regulars and the curious from the big city
crowd into a century-old saloon, Gruene Hall, sipping beer from
longneck bottles and beating the boards to the sounds of the
Fabulous Thunderbirds, Jerry Jeff Walker, Bo Diddley and other
big-names familiar to country music fans.
   ``A lot of great, sweaty nights happen here,'' says
singer-songwriter Hal Ketchum, leaning back in an old chair near
the hall's bar. ``There's nothing like a good 105-degree day in
here with your band.''
   By day, Gruene Hall is a meeting spot for Girl Scouts and
debutantes. But when the sun goes down it has become one of Texas'
hippest honky-tonks. It's pictured on album covers and serves as
folksy stage set for videos and television specials.
   Like the music shrines of Nashville, Gruene Hall attracts
thousands of music fans to this little village, a historic district
that has remained a community unto itself despite being
incorporated into New Braunfels, a town of 22,000 people a few
miles up the road from San Antonio.
   Henry Gruene (pronounced green), for whom the town was named,
built the hall in the 1870s as a social center. Local farmers came
to the hall to weigh their cotton before delivering it to the gin
next door, and on Saturday nights brought their families there to
dance, bedding down their children next to the walls on the
original hardwood floor.
   The old wood-burning stove remains, as do decorative signs
dating to the 1920s.
   The hall and several other Gruene buildings are owned by Jane
Nalley of New Braunfels and Pat Molak of San Antonio. Molak bought
the hall and reopened it 15 years ago after it had been in disuse
for several decades.
   It long has been a favorite haunt of country-and-western, blues,
rock and folk musicians, and in the last few years gained some
national renown.
   Country music connoisseurs will recognize the names George
Strait and June Carter Cash. Strait played here about once a month
for six years before he became a star. He returned in January to
tape commercials promoting a tour.
   June Carter Cash _ Johnny Cash's wife _ arrived in January with
her three sisters to film a documentary about their musician
mother, Maybelle Carter.
   Despite Gruene Hall's newfound glory, owners Molak and Nalley
keep it a laid-back place _ no advance ticket sales, no dressing
rooms for the musicians no matter how big they've become.
   Truth is, Gruene Hall is a beer joint. Or, as Molak calls it, a
dive, and a good-sized dive at that. About 500 people crowd inside
to dance and listen to a live perforsmance.
   ``They have good concerts, I know that. For a town this small,
it's amazing how they attract big-name people in here,'' says John
Graves, a 23-year-old student at Southwest Texas State University
in nearby San Marcos who likes to hang out at Gruene Hall to shoot
pool.
   Country singer and recent Grammy winner Rodney Crowell heard
about Gruene Hall and called one time wanting to play here, Ms.
Nalley says.
   Another Grammy winner, Lyle Lovett, also played the hall, as
have Michael Murphy, Delbert McClinton, Gary P. Nunn and dozens of
others whose pictures dot the walls near the bar.
   Hal Ketchum, 37, hopes to one day count himself among the famous
who got their start in Gruene Hall, where he was given his first
chance to play one of his own songs in public. Now he and a
five-piece dance band play there about six times a year.
   Gruene Hall, he says, was his music school, a place where he was
able to hear some of the greats.
   ``There's a lot of old notes hanging in the air here,'' he says.

   It's no secret that railroads have been dying
like elms for a generation. What's so alarming, then, when one more
faces bankruptcy? It happens that the one on its deathbed today was
the nation's first railroad, and what would end with it is a
romantic chapter of American folklore.

   As a boy back in the 1920s, Dick Williams
spent his happiest hours down at the railroad yard with his father,
a dispatcher.
   In those days railroads were in their heyday, already a legend
of American expansion and industry. In young Williams' view no
occupation could be more romantic or more necessary than
railroading.
   Or more permanent. Because the railroad where his father worked,
and which he later served for 40 years, was the Delaware &amp; Hudson
Railroad Co., the venerable D&amp;H, the nation's oldest railroad. It
made its first run in 1829.
   It might make its last run any day now.
   If no one buys the D&amp;H in the next few weeks, men will unhook
its cars and sell them off one by one. Dick Williams always felt he
would be long dead before such a historical ignominy would ever
come to pass.
   ``It's hard to see this happening to a railroad you worked on
your entire life,'' says Williams. Williams, who is 61, took early
retirement six years ago because he couldn't bear to stick around
and listen to the death rattle.
   If no buyer comes forward, more than 400 workers who make sure
the D&amp;H keeps its schedule on runs between Montreal and Washington
and between Albany and Buffalo would lose their jobs. America would
lose a chapter of its folklore.
   The Delaware &amp; Hudson didn't start out as a railroad.
   In 1823, brothers William and Maurice Wurtz, merchants from
Philadelphia, carved out a canal from northern Pennsylvania to
Kingston, N.Y., to haul coal.
   Six years later the brothers began using a new technology called
a ``gravity line.'' Stationary steam engines hauled cable cars up
the hills, gravity took them down, and horses pulled them in
between.
   D&amp;H began using steam locomotives in 1860 and gradually expanded
into the Northeast and Canada.
   During the Civil War the D&amp;H hauled coal to northern arsenals.
In 1885, a D&amp;H train carried the body of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant for
a final viewing before the former president was buried in New York.
In the next century American soldiers made part of their journey
south aboard the D&amp;H to fight the Mexican bandit Pancho Villa.
   Before the start of World War II, Winston Churchill rode the D&amp;H
into Canada after a stop in Washington to ask Congress for money to
fight Hitler's Germany.
   In those days more than 250,000 miles of railroad track
criss-crossed America and Dick Williams, as a telegraph operator
and train dispatcher as his father before him, watched it all and
marveled.
   Today his Albany home is a museum of D&amp;H memorabilia, including
an old telegraph ``bug'' his father gave him when he was 12 years
old. He can still tap out words, still remembers Morse Code 30
years after the D&amp;H stopped using telegraphs.
   Williams moved on from telegraph operator to dispatcher and then
fireman and eventually worked his way up to general manager in 1980.
   ``Railroad men were a breed all by themselves.'' he said,
reflecting on those glory days of railroading. ``They'd do anything
for one another. It was like a family. You felt good accomplishing
what you were supposed to do. You took pride in your work.''
   Railroad business began declining in the 1950s with the growth
of the interstate highway system and the trucking industry.
   ``Trucks had a highway system that was free to them. Railroads
had to own the property they ran over and in most cases had to pay
taxes on that property,'' William says.
   By the 1970s, mergers and acquisitions were commonplace as
railroads struggled to stay alive. The federal government got
involved and the result was Conrail, an amalgamation of the Penn
Central, New Jersey Central, Reading, Erie Lackawanna and several
smaller railroads that were either bankrupt or about to be.
   Conrail was supposed to provide D&amp;H with friendly connections
cut off by the mergers of several railway companies surrounding
D&amp;H, federal officials said. They said it also would allow D&amp;H to
extend into Buffalo and as far south as Washington and remain
competitive with the federally subsidized Conrail.
   While Williams agrees some federal action was necessary to save
the railroad industry in the Northeast, he says what was done did
little to help D&amp;H. D&amp;H had to use Conrail track to haul freight to
its new destinations, at a price set by Conrail. That price wasn't
competitive, Williams says.
   ``We had an opportunity to provide some competition and we
attempted to have a profitable operation. But it didn't work,'' he
says. ``But you had to try or you were dead. Conrail was a blood
transfusion for D&amp;H, that's all.''
   D&amp;H struggled to remain solvent, propped up by state and federal
money. From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, D&amp;H received almost
$40 million in federal aid.
   By the 1980s, D&amp;H was one of the Northeast's last major
privately owned railroads. But it was losing money _ $14 million in
1982.
   Hope of continued survival came in 1984 in the form of Guilford
Transportation Industries of Billerica, Mass. Guilford owner
Timothy Mellon, a financier and descendant of the Pittsburgh
banking family, bought D&amp;H to complete a Northeast rail network
made up of the Guilford-owned Maine Central and Boston &amp; Maine
railroads.
   The buyout created a system stretching from New England to
Buffalo with legs north to Montreal and south to Baltimore and
Washington. It was an attempt to compete with Conrail in the
Northeast.
   However, negotiations with D&amp;H employees to change labor
contracts faltered. Four years after it purchased D&amp;H, Guilford put
it into bankruptcy.
   Guilford officials blame the railroad's demise on D&amp;H's archaic
union work rules. D&amp;H employees, Williams says, blamed Guilford's
inexperience in running a railroad.
   The fate of the D&amp;H now rests with a Washington lawyer, Francis
Dicello, appointed trustee in 1988 by a federal bankruptcy court.
   Dicello says he will try to find a buyer for the line within the
next few weeks. If that fails, he may ask the court's permission to
liquidate.
   D&amp;H President Carl Belke insists the railroad will survive.
   ``We intend to be here one way or another,'' he says.

   Christopher Reeve says his latest television
movie, ``The Rose and the Jackal,'' relies on imagination to fill
in blank pages in one episode of the Civil War.
   The movie, which premieres Monday on Turner Network Television,
pits two historical figures against each other in a story of love
and honor.
   ``We take two historical figures in Washington, on opposite
sides in the war, and imagine what their relationship might have
been,'' Reeve says.
   Reeve stars as Allan Pinkerton, the private detective who
founded the Secret Service and had the duty of stopping the flow of
military secrets to the South.
   Madolyn Smith Osborne is Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a beautiful and
aristocratic Southerner who operated a Confederate spy ring out of
her Georgetown mansion. She was known as ``the Merry Widow of
Washington,'' and one senator said she had ``incomparable seductive
powers.'' It was rumored she had an affair with President James
Buchanan.
   ``Pinkerton had her under surveillance and then under house
arrest and finally sent her to the Old Capitol Prison,'' Reeve
says. ``What the movie imagines is that he developed an obsession
with her. The story deals with his attempts to break her and make
her sign a loyalty oath to the Union _ and her standing firm in her
beliefs.
   ``These are two passionate individuals fighting for what they
believe in.''
   This production began as a historical footnote that writer Eric
Edson spotted in Margaret Leech's ``Reveille in Washington.'' It
mentioned the names of Pinkerton and Greenhow and inspired Edson's
screenplay. He wrote it originally as a theatrical film, but even
with a well-known actress set for the role of Greenhow no studio
would make it. Six years later, it was accepted by TNT.
   The role is a real change of pace for Reeve, who is best known
as the Man of Steel in ``Superman.'' In this historical drama he
wears a beard, has a Scottish accent and is an obsessive and
self-righteous man.
   The story focuses on the class distinctions between Pinkerton
and Greenhow, Reeve says.
   ``Pinkerton was a working class Scottish immigrant,'' he says.
``Rose Greenhow was a Southern aristocrat. Pinkerton was a private
detective, a gumshoe.
   ``She was the Southern rose. He was the jackal who pursued her
until he finally devoured her.
   ``One event our film covers is that she was tipped off on when
Union troops would move on Bull Run and she got word to General
Beauregard. The Union lost the first battle of Bull Run. It was a
very high priority in Washington to neutralize her.''
   Pinkerton was very protective of Abraham Lincoln and foiled a
plot in Baltimore to kill him prior to his first inauguration.
Pinkerton was out of his element, however, as a military analyst.
He underestimated Confederate strength at Antietam and helped cause
another defeat. By 1863 he had retreated to Chicago and gone back
into private practice.
   Jack Gold directed ``The Rose and the Jackal,'' which was filmed
on location in Georgia _ Savannah, Macon, Atlanta and Stone
Mountain.
   ``We used the same Civil War re-enacters who were in `Glory,'''
Reeve says. ``They know all the battles and all the details.''
   Reeve moves between roles in movies, television and the theater.
Besides the four ``Superman'' movies, he was in ``Switching
Channels,'' ``Street Smart,'' ``Deathtrap,'' ``Somewhere in Time''
and ``The Bostonians.'' He starred in ``Anna Karenina'' and ``The
Great Escape II: The Untold Story'' for television.
   Reeve is not sure there will be any more ``Superman'' movies.
   ``If there is another, it's time to recast,'' he says. ``I'm
getting too old to play him again. `Superman' is perennially 30
years old. You can't have an aging `Superman.' But it has less to
do with age than the fact that I was pretty disappointed in the
last picture.''
   Reeve lives on a 40-acre farm near Williamstown, Mass., where he
frequently appears at the Williamstown Theater Festival. The
Massachusetts home base allows him to indulge in his passion for
skiing and sailing.
   Last year he had built a 46-foot sloop called The Sea Angel.
   ``These interests are as satisfying to me as acting,'' he says.

   ``Well, I was bowled over. Right then and there I fell in love
with Charles MacArthur, the most beautiful, most amusing, most
amazing and dazzling man I had ever met.''
   ``Charlie never lived that remark down,'' Miss Hayes says in an
interview. ``On our 25th wedding anniversary we went to `21' _
Charlie loved that restaurant, it was his hangout _ and on our
table they had a bowl of salted peanuts, dyed green.
   ``Everyone kept reminding me that Charlie still had a wife,
though they had been separated for years, and that I was a
Catholic. Marrying Charlie meant excommunication so to me it is
still astonishing that I never hesitated, that from the start I was
prepared to rebel against mother and Mother Church and anyone else
who tried to come between us,'' she writes.
   Charlie, she writes, could not bear to take a wife better known
than he, a constant thorn as Miss Hayes remained better known.
   When ``The Front Page,'' opened, Charlie and his co-author, Ben
Hecht, fled to the fire escape shortly after the curtain went up.
   ``A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in. Percy
Hammond, the Tribune critic, was chuckling and pounding his
companion on the back. Charlie Chaplin's eyes were rolling. The
audience was breaking up with laughter.
   ``I ran to the fire escape and shouted, `It's a hit!' Whereupon
Charlie opened his arms and asked, `Will you marry me, Helen?'
   ``It was a marriage planned by God,'' she says, despite its
rocky times, mostly caused by MacArthur's love of the bottle.
``Until Mary died, the drinking was only sporadic. But then Charlie
set about killing himself. It took seven years, and it was
harrowing to watch,'' she writes.
   Miss Hayes does not care for any of the movies she made. After
the TV movie ``Murder with Mirrors,'' the producer called to tell
her 20 million people had watched it.
   ``I found that I felt depressed,'' she writes. ``Twenty million
people! The total audience I had reached in 80 years in the theater
_ all those plays, all those beautiful lines, all that shared
intimacy with live patrons _ amounted to a tiny fraction of the
number of people who had watched me the night before in a mediocre
TV show.''
   Miss Hayes writes hilariously about her encounters with royalty.
Her mother had lectured her never to speak to celebrities unless
they spoke to you.
   She tells of her meeting the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia, who
had a job promoting Machiavelli's perfume at Bergdorf's.
   ``When Marie came into my dressing room, she sat down on the
sofa and gave me a bottle of perfume,'' Miss Hayes writes. ``Before
I could stop myself, my first utterance was, `Is Your Serene
Highness still working at Machiavelli's perfume counter?'''
   Then there was an afternoon ferry boat ride with Beatrice Lillie
to Blackwell's Island in the East River, home to a hospital for the
mentally ill. After strolling around, lunching on hot dogs, ice
cream and lemonade, they decided to leave. Bea Lillie, in private
life was Lady Peel, married to a member of the British peerage and
capable of pulling that rank when needed.
   At the ferry, a guard asked for their passes.
   ```My dear sir,' Bea replied in her toniest Lady Peel voice, `I
am Beatrice Lillie, and this is Helen Hayes. We both have
performances to give tonight, and we have to get to our theaters.'
''
   ``The guard was unmoved. Then she added, in her best British
accent, `I am Lady Peel; Miss Hayes is the first lady of the
American theater, and this gentleman is the distinguished
playwright, Mr. Charles MacArthur.'
   ``The guard sighed wearily. `Listen, lady, we're already got
some Lillies here, and several first ladies and maybe a couple of
MacArthurs, too. So show me a pass or get back to the hospital and
take tea with Greta Garbo and Lady Astor. There are a few of them,
too, roaming around.'''

   Americans crossing the Atlantic this year can get
a real feeling of what it was like in southern England when Britain
stood alone against the Luftwaffe 50 years ago.
   It was World War II leader Sir Winston Churchill who named the
struggle the Battle of Britain even before it began.
   As it was being fought in the summer of 1940, he said of the few
hundred Royal Air Force pilots from 19 nations who clashed head-on
with hordes of German bombers and their protecting screens of
fighters: ``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed
by so many to so few.''
   From April to October this year, exhibitions and air displays
will recall that summer when the Hurricanes and Spitfires met the
enemy air fleets pouring in from airfields in newly conquered
northeast France.
   The biggest ground effort marking the 50th anniversary of the
four months' combat in the sky is the ``Battle of Britain
Experience'' at the Royal Air Force Museum, April 11-Oct. 31.
   The museum at historic Hendon airfield in north London can be
reached from Colindale Underground station (Northern line) or Mill
Hill train station. Buses will shuttle from the two stations to the
museum throughout the summer.
   Sound recordings made in 1940 of air raid sirens, the whine of
aircraft and the distant crackle of machine guns usher visitors to
the museum into a labyrinth of relics, photographs, an entire
operations control room as it was at the height of the battle, and
the aircraft that took part.
   ``Besides a Hurricane and a Spitfire, we have the best
collection of German aircraft in the world,'' said spokesman
Michael Tagg.
   ``Visitors can see the Messerschmitt 109 and 110 fighters, the
Heinkel 111 and Junkers 87 and 88 bombers and even an Italian Fiat
C.R. 42, which made a forced landing during the only raid by the
Italian air force.''
   The biggest anniversary in the air is Sept. 15, when Queen
Elizabeth II will be on the Buckingham Palace balcony as a 12-mile
column of 163 veteran and modern aircraft flies above. Survivors of
``The Few'' will line up in front of the palace.
   Here are some other places to go:
   At London's Imperial War Museum is Spitfire R6915, which shot
down two German aircraft in the battle; plans of the German
invasion that never took place, the story of radar, flying
equipment and medals and, in the bookshop, a dossier of reproduced
documents selling for about $14.
   Visitors giving notice the day before can browse in the library
among scores of books about the battle and British and German
records of it.
   Don't miss Paul Nash's painting of a typical scene in the battle
_ contrails over the English countryside.
   At Duxford, a battle airfield near Cambridge and 56 miles
northwest of London, is the Imperial War Museum's huge collection
of aircraft of both world wars, including Spitfires and Hurricanes.
   ``The whole place is an exhibit,'' said Tagg. ``We restored it
exactly as it was on Sept. 19, 1940, and visitors can see how its
squadrons were controlled.''
   Duxford will stage an airshow of fighter planes July 8.
   The Cabinet War Rooms in London, built underground for
protection from air raids close to the prime minister's official
residence in Downing Street, displays 21 historic rooms that served
as headquarters for Churchill, the war Cabinet and the chiefs of
staff, with desks, bunks, maps, telephones and files just as they
were at the war's end in 1945.
   Close by is Westminster Abbey with its Battle of Britain Chapel,
its wall still marked by German bomb shrapnel.
   At the port of Dover, the battle's front line, a complex of
tunnels in the chalk cliffs is being opened to show operations
rooms and where townspeople sheltered from raids.
   Less than 10 miles from Dover is Folkestone, and nearby is
Hawkinge airfield, an RAF base during the battle. It has a museum
of British and German aircraft relics, mementoes of such aces as
Robert Stanford Tuck and Al Deere, all the weapons used in the
battle by both sides, and equipment and uniforms donated by British
and German pilots.
   Visitors interested in buying relics can attend two auctions: on
Sept. 13 at Bentley Priory in Stanmore, northwest London,
headquarters of the British commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh
Dowding (the only time the building will open the public) and on
Sept. 15 at the RAF Museum in Hendon.
   Dowding's statue is in London outside St. Clement Danes, the RAF
headquarters church.
   Americans can make a pilgrimage to aptly named Gravesend, 25
miles east of London, to see the grave of Detroit-born Hugh
Reilley, shot down in his Spitfire by German ace Werner Moelders.
   Reilley was one of a handful of Americans to get into the battle
when the United States was still neutral.
   All the airmen in the battle are commemorated in a memorial at
Runnymede, 21 miles west of London, where memorials to Magna Carta
and U.S. President John F. Kennedy are also located.
   The Battle of Britain resulted from Hitler's determination to
force the country to surrender. Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering
told him he could force Britain to its knees: his fighters would
shoot the Royal Air Force out of the sky while his bombers would
destroy RAF airfields, aircraft production factories, and docks.
   But although the RAF was outnumbered 4 to 1 in aircraft, it was
fighting close to its bases, it could rescue more pilots and
salvage more planes than the Germans, the German codes had been
broken and the radar early warning system pinpointed the location
of the approaching enemy air fleets.
   The RAF came close to defeat, but the Germans did not know that,
and German losses in aircraft and men in the daylight battles were
so unexpected that the Luftwaffe turned to night bomber raids on
British cities.
   According to the comprehensive account in the book, ``The Battle
of Britain Then and Now,'' the Luftwaffe lost 2,662 airmen killed
and 1,887 aircraft, while the RAF lost 537 airmen killed and 1,023
aircraft.
   There are many books on the battle. Recommended are ``Fighter''

<DATELINE>TAXCO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesus Hernandez, 14, probably will grow up
to be the mayor of this town. He already is one of the best public
relations men of this Mexican colonial jewel.
   ``We are honest people, we do not do things we are not supposed
to,'' he explained to a visitor concerned about parking a car
nearby.
   But in addition to honest people, Jesus' hometown of Taxco,
little more than two hours away from Mexico City, offers a capsule
of Mexico's rich history from pre-Hispanic days through the era of
colonial legends to the present.
   At night, seen from the roof of a church of a neighoring town
across a valley, Taxco rests sparkling on the side of a dark
mountain made hollow by hundreds of years of gold and silver mining
by Indians, Spaniards and Mexicans.
   By day, the city of nearly 130,000 people is a small tableau of
white-washed homes and narrow, winding streets dominated by the two
towers of The Santa Prisca Church, built in 1748.
   In Aztec days Taxco Indians paid tribute in blocks of gold and
silver, according to legend. Now, tourists flock to Taxco to buy
the silver handicrafts produced by scores of families who have made
a living of the art for generations.
   There still are several silver mines in operation now run by the
government, but the silver used in town by the artisans comes from
the Central Bank in Mexico City.
   A visitor can buy wholesale silver-plated bracelets for a few
dollars, pay $90 for a ceramic and silver dinner plate, or spend as
much as $5,000 for a flower vase with silver and conch shell
designs.
   At the Los Castillo shop, the vistors can watch artisans at
their trade.
   Nearby at the Elena Ballesteros shop, visitors are shown
masterpieces combining coral and silver that won awards at the
annual national competition.
   ``The Europeans and the Japanese buy the expensive pieces,''
said a shop attendant. ``The Americans want to buy souvenirs.''
   Tourists walk the narrow streets, climbing to the small plaza in
front of the Santa Prisca Church. They wander in and out of shops
where, in addition to silver works, they can find colorful baskets,
paintings and antiques like an 1887 edition of Don Quixote.
   ``I came here to study architecture,'' said Hugo Fernando Lopez,
standing in front of his store made out of a large hole carved on
the side of the mountain. ``I started working with silver, and then
I opened this shop. And now I spend a lot of time going around
looking for antiques. I'll never leave.''
   Young Jesus has no plans to leave, either. At 14, he already has
taken several courses in the local tourism school run by the
government and speaks with the authority of an expert as he shows
tourists the church and its surrounding areas while going on about
Taxco's history.
   ``Santa Prisca was a young Roman virgin who was thrown to the
lions by a Roman emperor, but the lions would not touch her because
she was a saint, so the emperor ordered her beheaded,'' Jesus tells
visitors to the church in an almost devout manner showing them a
painting in one of the church naves.
   He guides the visitors around to a side entrance ``because we
must respect those who are praying,'' to show them an altar with a
copy of a monstrance, or receptacle for the Holy Host. The original
weighed about 31 pounds in gold and is now at Notre Dame Cathedral
in Paris.
   The church is a colonial jewel, with two large towers made of
pink stone that are among the best examples of the 18th century
churrigueresque style (after the Spanish architect Jose
Churriguera), often described as an exuberant baroque.
   It was built by Don Jose de la Borda, who came to Taxco as a
young man of 16 and made _ and lost _ fortunes mining silver.
   ``God gives to La Borda and La Borda gives to God,'' reads his
family's motto, explaining his generosity to the Church.
   European artisans were brought in to build the church. An 18th
century German organ is still played, and the church's elaborate,
carved-wood altars are gold-plated.
   Taxco is a short ride down from the Mexico City Valley south
toward Cuernavaca and then through the mountains on the highway to
the Pacific resort of Acapulco.
   Its hotels can accomodate 895. They range from small hotels
without television in the downtown area to the five-star Monte
Taxco hotel atop the mountain.
   Nearly 8,000 foreign tourists visit Taxco every month. Mexicans
like it, too, and about 9,000 of them also visit the town every
month.
   ``Have you ever seen a sunset where the sky turns gold all
around over the mountains?'' said longtime resident Armando
Rodriguez. ``You can see it here.''

   The glut of hotel rooms of a few years ago that
enabled picky tourists to choose from an array of bargains has
ended. In fact, things are so bad that two airlines plan to issue
sleeping bags to stranded passengers.
   Room occupancy has been averaging more than 90 percent in recent
months. So Singapore International Airlines and the Australian
carrier Qantas hope that sleeping bags will make unexpected
layovers or flight delays at Changi Airport more bearable when no
rooms are available.
   Sleeping bags will be used only as a last resort, according to
an SIA spokesman. But stranded passengers zipped into sleeping bags
in designated areas ``is certainly far better than letting them lie
around the transit halls,'' he says.
   This city-state of 2.6 million people expects 5 million visitors
this year. It has 68 hotels and 24,142 rooms now, with 72 hotels
and 26,185 rooms expected to be available by the end of 1992.
   By then the Raffles Hotel, a 104-year-old landmark, is expected
to reopen after a $52-million facelift.
   Room rates, heavily discounted as recently as two years ago, are
expected to increase as much as 40 percent in the next two years.
   One stopgap under study is to offer apartments in government
housing projects for visitors on a bed-and-breakfast basis.
   Singapore became a regional tourist stopover mainly because
visitors could pick up some bargains on their way to the beaches of
Bali or the temples in Thailand. But there are few bargains these
days. Only freespenders from Japan and Taiwan might find it
relatively inexpensive, because the local dollar has depreciated
along with its U.S. counterpart.
   With few natural and manmade attractions, the Tourist Promotion
Board plugged the island successfully in the 1970s as ``Instant
Asia,'' a clean and crime-free metropolis where most people spoke
English and the water was safe to drink.
   In one promotion, visitors could book breakfast at the
Zoological Gardens with an orangutan named Ah Meng. The ape with
impeccable table manners proved a popular attraction.
   Spurred by the euphoria of surging tourism in the mid and late
1970s and optimistic forecasts that the boom would continue,
developers built more hotels than tourists could fill. Some 8,000
rooms were added in 1982-86, a 57 percent increase.
   When overall occupancy plummeted, hoteliers cut staff and closed
entire floors to save on energy and maintenance. At least six new
hostelries delayed opening. Several went into receivership.
   Bargain room rates eventually helped bring foreigners back. The
government still markets Singapore as the ``Exotic East,'' despite
complaints that urban renewal wiped out most of Chinatown and other
colorful old sites. It also seeks to maintain its standing as one
of the top convention cities in Asia.
   The Brussels-based International Union of Associations ranks
Singapore ninth in the world for international meetings.
   Sleeping bags or not, the stakes are high. By 1987 the tourist
sector generated the equivalent of $1.24 billion, or 6 percent of
the country's gross domestic product.

<TEXT>
   The Third District of Budapest, lying
on the Buda side, is likely to be overlooked by the average visitor
to the city, although it adjoins the major tourist areas of the
Fishermen's Bastion and Margaret Island with its hot springs and
luxury hotels.
   It deserves a closer look. It is a place where antiquity, the
nearer past and the present all come together.
   If you take the boat upstream to the medieval town and
present-day artistic center of Szentendre, you'll be going past the
Third District much of the way. The handy electric train known by
its initials HEV and costing about 10 cents goes right through the
Third District on the way to Szentendre.
   Consider names of two of the train stations: Aquincum and Roman
Furdo (bath).
   Yes, the Romans were here. They conquered the Pannonians, of
Illyrian stock, in 9 A.D. and formed the province of Pannonia,
later divided into Upper and Lower Pannonia.
   Aquincum was the capital of Lower Pannonia, and the layout of
the town is still apparent, showing outlines of the amphitheaters
of the Roman military town and the Roman civil town, including a
pillared hall and the sites of some town houses. The museum at the
site contains statuary, coins, jewelry, a water-organ, a Jupiter
column and other artifacts of Aquincum's Roman days. Aquincum has
hours like any other museum complex; a check with your hotel or
Ibusz, the Hungarian Tourist Office, is advised, though much of it
can be seen from the train and surrounding streets.
   Aquincum eventually formed the nucleus of Obuda (Old Buda),
which joined with Buda and Pest in the early 1870s to become
Budapest. Obuda, according to tradition, was the residence of
Attila the Hun, who in the fifth century won big concessions from
the Romans. Later, in the ninth century, Arpad and the Magyars took
over the region and established the first dynasty of Hungarian
kings. The town flourished in the Middle Ages, and the remains of a
palace for Hungarian queens are still in evidence. Then came the
Turks, and the town fell into decay. German-speaking settlers put
it back on its feet in the 17th century.
   Much of Budapest once was farmland, and this is evident in the
area between Aquincum and the city line. In Bekamsmegyer, high-rise
white box apartment blocks face streets of stuccoed old peasant
houses, with tile roofs and chimneys originally built to vent the
big tile stoves that were a traditional source of heat in such
houses. Here are orchards, vegetable plots, and enough crows for a
midwestern corn field. Services still are held in the old church,
and the neighborhood restaurant operates in one of the old
buildings, with gypsy music to go with its tasty fare.
   But then turn around and confront the present, walking among the
apartment houses with lobbies of unadorned concrete, lit by raw
lightbulbs. Upstairs, the apartments are likely to be attractive
and modern, with traditional Hungarian embroidered pillows on the
couches and sofa beds that Budapest's housing shortage mandates in
every living room. Traditional plates painted with flowers may hang
on the walls, sometimes clashing with those hung by the younger
set, decorated with distorted faces and the word ``Punk.''
   During the most recent Christmas season, many families sat up
until midnight beside their lighted trees, listening to the
television news of the government upset in Romania. Many of the
older generation came from or have relatives in Transylvania, where
Romania's Hungarian minority lives.
   On a typical day, shoppers go early in the morning to the
supermarket in Bekasmegyer to get fresh rolls for breakfast and buy
their day's supply of coffee beans, which they grind on the spot.
In the evening, high-rise dwellers walk their dogs.
   This is a blue collar district, where young people go off to
work with computers, in the government, as accountants, or even as
rock musicians. Many older people work too, even if it's only
selling their embroidery.
   Roman antiquities seem far away. But they're just down the road.
The jam-packed HEV train taking commuters to work at 6 a.m. will
pass between one of the Aquincum amphitheaters and the remains of a
Roman wall.

   The beaches and mountains still attract millions of America's
vacationing families, but the high seas are luring a growing share
of the nation's travelers.
   According to travel industry observers, the number of families
among the more than 3.5 million Americans who take cruises annually
has increased dramatically.
   The most important reason is the price, says Bob Dickinson,
senior vice-president of sales and marketing for Carnival Cruise
Lines.
   ``Special rates for children has made cruising one of the most
affordable and relaxing ways for families to take a vacation,'' he
notes, adding that for families with infants his company's ships
are equipped with cribs and high chairs, and baby-sitting is
available at a nominal charge.
   According to Dickinson, several cruise lines have developed a
special on-board schedule of activities especially for children.
   On Carnival cruises, for example, events geared toward ages 4-12
might include a scavenger hunt, a ship-drawing contest and a soft
drink party with the captain.
   ``A teen schedule might feature a `Name That Tune' contest or
teen trivia contest, pingpong tournament and disco party,''
Dickinson says. ``All onboard facilities, including discos, video
game rooms and swimming pools, are available to younger passengers,
as well as a playroom which serves as their own gathering place.''
   Youngsters especially enjoy kite flying, bingo, and movie time,
he adds, explaining:
   ``We find that many of them like participating in our programs
more than any other aspect of the cruise, and quite often, prefer
to stay on board rather than go ashore at the various ports of
call.''
   Programs for children, ages 6-12, are offered by the Norwegian
Cruise Line on board its fleet of six ships. On some of the ships,
programs are offered year-round, with shipboard youth coordinators
to plan and supervise activities.
   Highlights include a circus at sea, where children learn circus
routines like juggling and clowning, a tour of the bridge, treasure
hunts, games, and a cookout. Many cruises offer special shore
excursions exclusively for the kids.
   Among the companies offering programs tailored for families is
New York-based Regency Cruises, which has one for single parents or
grandparents at discounted rates.
   In addition to the usual children's activities, such as pool
parties, talent shows and ``Coketail'' parties, a specially
designated clubhouse is equipped just for kids.
   Regency also encourages families to have shipboard reunions, and
any group of at least eight related adults traveling together gets
a champagne bon voyage party, souvenir photos and a ``Happy
Reunion'' cake at the captain's welcome dinner.
   Particularly appealing to adults and youngsters alike are river
cruises aboard the Mississippi Queen, billed as the largest
steamboat the world has ever known, and the Delta Queen, recently
designated a National Historic Landmark.
   The two boats are operated by the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. of
New Orleans, which this year is celebrating its 100th anniversary.
Vacation cruises range from three to ll nights.
   A somewhat different luxury river cruise, new from French Cruise
Lines this year, takes the traveler to the rivers Rhone and Saone
in the French provinces, following the route of the Visigoths and
Romans, crusaders and popes, kings and queens.
   The company also will sail the just-launched, 100-passenger M.S.
Arlene on a series of one-week discovery cruises in the heart of
Burgundy, with its vineyards, and Avignon, with its Palace of the
Popes.
   Other offbeat cruise programs for 1990 include:
   _ An 18-day ``China Dynasty'' package between Hong Kong and
Beijing, offered by Pearl Cruises of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``The
people who need us most, the young people, are eager to again speak
to the foreign visitor, to gain knowledge of other countries, their
lifestyles, their thoughts,'' says Robert Eversen, company
president.
   _ A journey aboard the 88-passenger Americana down the East
Coast of the U.S. and South America from New York to Buenos Aires.
This combination passenger-freighter ship, operated by Ivaran
Lines, offers luxury accommodations, even while carrying such cargo
as automobile parts, coffee, leather goods, vegetable oils and
school books.
   _ A gametrackers ``flying boat'' safari down the Great Rift of
Africa, which uses a converted Catalina seaplane to reach often
remote and unspoiled areas of Africa almost impossible to visit by
surface transportation. Among the experiences included are gorilla
trekking in Zaire after the aircraft lands on mysterious Lake Kivu.

   Democracy was born in Athens, Greece, 2,500 years
ago _ a fact that Dallas is recognizing through the yearlong
``Dallas World Salute to Greece and Her Legacy.''
   Dallas civic leader Virginia Nick, herself of Greek heritage,
organized the event, which is being billed as the largest
celebration outside of Greece.
   ``Dallas is about the only city which is celebrating this
(anniversary of democracy),'' Mrs. Nick says. ``I feel the children
of today do not know a lot about democracy.
   ``There is so much that Greece gave to the world, and it seems
to be a forgotten thing these days.''
   With the upheaval in Eastern Europe, the celebration of
democracy is particularly fitting, she adds.
   The Greek Ministry of Culture will showcase an extensive series
of exhibits in Dallas, according to joint organizer Spyros
Mercouris, who is the brother of former Culture Minister Melina
Mercouri, the actress.
   Among the exhibits planned are:
   _ ``Athens, Birthplace of Democracy,'' about architecture and
town planning, which opened March 30 for a month-long run at Dallas
City Hall.
   _ Contemporary Greek art is being showcased at the Meadows
Museum at Southern Methodist University, featuring 14 notable Greek
contemporary artists. ``They show what we are doing now in
Greece,'' Mercouris said.
   _ ``Gold From Three Continents,'' will be on display at the
Dallas Museum of Art beginning April 8, featuring jewelry and
ritual objects from Greece, Africa and the ancient Americas.
   _ ``Mind and Body,'' an exhibit of the history of the Olympic
Games, will be on display at The Science Place in the spring of
1991.
   _ A collection of rare books from the Costa Staikos collection,
``The Editorial Activity of Greek Scholars during the Italian
Renaissance,'' will be on display at SMU.
   _ University of Texas-Southwestern will host an international
symposium on ancient Greek medicine April 5, opening an exhibit of
30 pharmaceutical herbs used by Hippocrates. The rare collection is
being donated to the university by Niki Goulandris of the
Goulandris Natural History Museum in Kifissia, Greece.
   ``Through the exchange of culture and ideas, a better
understanding is created among people,'' Mercouris said.

plants traditional in 16th century gardens will be a feature of the
Tudor garden being exhibited by Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, the British
toiletries firm. The garden has been designed by Jane
Fearnley-Whittingstall, whose ``Sudeley Castle Rose Garden'' won a
gold medal at last year's show, and will feature apple, raspberry
and strawberry blossoms mixed with damask roses, lilacs and
philadelphus. Rosemary, sage, sweet cecily and camomile sward will
divide the beds into a knot pattern of roses and germander, with
lavender, clove pink and viburnum added for even more fragrance.
C&amp;E says that after the show it will donate the garden to the
London Lighthouse, an AIDS hospice. _
   The Meeting of the Worlds Festival, Joensuu, Finland, June
19-23. Scheduled during Finland's ``white midsummer nights,'' this
international music, dance, theater, art and film festival will
wind up in Sortavala, across the border on the Soviet side. The
Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Kronos Quartet headline
the music program, and the film competition will be devoted to
documentaries about peace. Co-organizers are PAND International
(Performers and Artists for Nuclear Disarmament) and the annual
Joensuu Song Festival organization, who will donate proceeds to
UNICEF. For more information call the Finnish Tourist Board in New
York at (212) 949-2333. _
   Carnival, St. George's, Grenada, W.I., Aug. 11-14. This is
Grenada's largest celebration, which wakes up with a 5 a.m. cannon
firing at Ft. George and continues with costumed revellers with
``Ole Mas'' placards, Calypso music in Queen's Park, and the Parade
of Bands leading the traditional ``jump up'' through the streets of
the city. _

   Places to go, things to do and see:
   _ Benjamin Franklin 1990 Celebration in Philadelphia. If Ben
Franklin had put his ingenuity to work to think up a tourism
campaign theme, he couldn't have done better than to reincarnate
himself in time for the opening of the Franklin Institute's $65
million Futures Center, the only museum in the world dedicated to
science and technology in the 21st century, and the 250th
anniversary celebration of the University of Pennsylvania, which he
founded. Philadelphia has mounted a yearlong celebration of
Franklin's genius with ``electrifying'' exhibits, themed weekends,
and tours of Franklin Court at Independence National Historical
Park, the site of Franklin's home, print shop and post office.
Naturally, a white-haired gentleman wearing a lace jabot and
spectacles appears at many of these doings. For more information,
call the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau at (215) 636-1666.
   _ Pets and People Exhibit. The relationship between humans and
animals from their evolution as competitors for food to companions
for life is explored at this exhibition which runs through Sept. 3
at the Academy of Natural Sciences Museum in Philadelphia. There
are live animal demonstrations, a Pick-a-Pet interactive display
that matches pet to prospective owner, displays on animal ancestry,
working animals and the Pet Hall of Fame. The information number is
(215) 299-1000.
   _ Outdoor Wisconsin. Paddle, portage and kayak races, cow chip
tossing, burling and other competitions spice up the outdoor life
in this state. Bike tours are another possibility; the Elroy-Sparta
State Trail is a 33-mile roll through wooded valleys, small towns,
and hill tunnels, following the route of a disused rail line. Then
there are the state's uncounted and spectacular waterfalls to see
and sometimes splash in, like the Big Manitou Falls on the Black
River in Pattison State Park. How about birding, canoeing or
exploring Ice Age remains? Wisconsin Tourism Development has
information about them all. Call (1-800) 372-2737.
   _ Sea World. New this season at Sea World in San Diego is the
``Forbidden Reef,'' with an underwater cavern filled with moray
eels and a shallows area where visitors can touch and feed bat
rays. Juvenile leopard sharks, round stingrays, spiny lobsters and
shovelnose guitarfish also will be accommodated in the new exhibit.
Sea Worlds also are located in Orlando, Fla., Aurora, Ohio, and San
Antonio, Texas, and are part of Busch Entertainment Corporation,
which runs nine theme parks around the country.

   An estimated 150,000 Americans will visit
China this year, though more than twice that many were projected
for 1990 before last year's disturbances in Beijing.
   To offset the drop, China's national tourism office is working
to lure more visitors with new itineraries, according to Peter
Cheung, vice president and general manager of C&amp;C China Express, a
tour wholesaling company based in San Francisco.
   The Hulunbir Grasslands itinerary will let travelers visit
Mongolia, while others into northeast China offer visits to the ice
and snow festivals at cities like Harbin. The restored Old Summer
Palace, located in the mountains near Beijing, a new art and
antique bazaar in the capital city, and a theatrical museum in
Tianjin also are in place in time for this year's travelers.
   Domestic airline fare hikes will spur a rise of about 20 percent
in tour prices, says Cheung. He estimates that a typical two-week
tour of the country will cost about $1,900-$2,000, including
airfare, hotel, meals, sightseeing, transfers and baggage handling.
   He advises prospective visitors to study travel material before
making firm plans. Besides guidebooks, travelers can get maps,
brochures and planning materials from the China National Tourist
Office, 60 E 42nd St., Suite 3126, New York, N.Y. 10165.

   With summer comes the annual influx of tourists to the Napa
Valley, California's renowned wine-growing region.
   The 10th annual Napa Valley Wine Auction, which provides bidders
and guests with an opportunity to sample more than 100 Napa Valley
wines, is set for June 7-9 at the Meadowood Resort Hotel in St.
Helena, Calif. Proceeds benefit local health care facilities.
   This year's auction takes place in conjunction with the barrel
tasting at Inglenook.
   The Napa Valley Wine Train, which began passenger service in
September, 1989, offers daily brunch, lunch and dinner excursions
on a three-hour, 36-mile round-trip between Napa and St. Helena.

   Even adventure comes packaged these days.
   There are packages for traveling in relatively uncharted
territory in South Africa, including one 17-day tour that crosses
the world's oldest desert for sightings of rare desert elephants or
5,000-year-old rock engravings before moving into Bushmanland to
make contact with some of the remaining ``little people.'' Travel
is by all-terrain vehicles carrying supplies and camping equipment,
according to the South African Tourism Board. Other trips include a
photo tour of little-visited areas in the northern area of Kruger
National Park, known for its elephant herds, or ranger-led trail
walks in the park lasting three or four days.
   Tanzania and Kenya expeditions are offered by the Los
Angeles-based Tusker Trail &amp; Safari Co. Travel is by
four-wheel-drive vehicles and most accommodation is under tent
canvas, though the Kenya safari, climbing through the foothills of
Mount Kenya, stops at the Mount Kenya Safari Club. The Tanzania
trip includes exploration of the Serengeti wildlife reserve and the
Tarangire National Park.
   Rafting the Katun River in Siberia for two weeks and camping out
in a wilderness encompassing glacial valleys, steep gorges and
forested canyons is possible through a tour organized by Prescott
Mallory Howe of Huntington, N.Y. Participants, who must be in good
physical shape and able to swim, will learn rafting skills and meet
the people of some remote Siberian villages, some of whom have
never seen Americans before. The trips are arranged under a
Soviet-American exchange program called Project RAFT.
   An outfit called Idaho Afloat takes the rough edge off river
journeys and camping along the Snake River. ``Many people were put
off by the idea of camping trips, as they were viewed as
experiences on which one has to rough it,'' says Scott Fasken,
owner-operator of the tour service. His 22-foot cargo raft comes
equipped with kitchen and gear for deluxe camping along the way,
including tables, chairs and large guest tents. Fasken adds that
his guides take special care to teach children about the wildlife
and history of Hell's Canyon and lead them on hikes to explore
archaeological remains, Indian burial sites and abandoned
homesteads. Meanwhile, parents can divert themselves with hiking,
swimming, photography or whatever else they choose. Idaho Afloat is
based in Grangeville, Idaho.

   Weight Watchers magazine, which devotes its July issue to
travel, provides some advice for keeping the fat out of your
vacation while leaving the fun in.
   _ Plan ahead. Request special meals while buying plane tickets,
for example.
   _ With regular airplane food, scrape the sauce off the entree,
have one or two bites, and eat the bread. Don't pour dressing on
the salad, but dip the fork into the dressing, then eat some salad.
   For long flights, take snacks from home, like fresh fruit or
vegetables sealed in plastic bags. And stay out of the airport
snack shops if your flight is delayed.
   _ Choose one realistic goal for the trip, like splitting
desserts.
   _ For car travel, pack a small cooler with diet sodas, iced tea,
bottled water, individual cereal boxes, yogurt, fruits and
vegetables. For crunchier snacks, bring popcorn.
   _ In restaurants, order sauce on the side to control the amount
you eat. Ask for fresh fruit with whipped topping for dessert, or
split a dessert with someone else. If you're having pizza, have it
plain and skip the sausage, pepperoni and other greasy toppings.
   _ If you do eat heavily one day, go light the next with a little
bit of protein and some carbohydrates. Include fruits and
vegetables, and drink plenty of water.

<DATELINE>CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Here's a word of advice about taking
your pet with you on your vacation:
   Don't.
   ``Vacations aren't for pets,'' says Dr. Ken Clever, professor of
veterinary medical technology at Wilson College. ``They, and you,
will be happier if you place them in a good boarding facility or
with a trusted friend or family member.''
   Motion sickness and heat exhaustion are the most likely problems
your pet will encounter, according to Clever. And other, odder,
dangers can come up. He recalls treating a dog that had been
dragged a half-mile on an interstate highway because the owner had
tied it to the bumper of his car during a rest stop and then forgot
about it.
   If you insist on taking your pet, then plan for accommodating
the animal on the road.
   Take your pet on a test ride or two before the trip to determine
if it will get motion sickness. ``This problem is very common with
dogs and cats. Your veterinarian can prescribe a medication to
prevent vomiting.'' He adds that it's not a good idea to medicate
an animal on a just-in-case basis.
   ``You may also find that cats sometimes get a little excited on
trips,'' he says. The veterinarian can advise you about sedatives
for overly active pets.
   Plan adequate room for the animal to move around. ``You
shouldn't stuff a pet into an already crowded car, nor should you
keep the animal in the front seat, where the animal could distract
the driver,'' he says. The back seat is the safest spot, since
there's no way to secure a pet with a seat belt.
   If you must leave your pet in the car, roll the windows down a
bit. This may seem like obvious advice, Clever says, but many
owners forget, and their pets suffer heat exhaustion.
   Another problem is accommodation. Since many places won't take
pets, you will have to map out the trip more closely than usual to
assure a place to stay. Clever suggests campgrounds, since more of
them welcome pets.
   Before you go, be sure your pet's vaccinations are up to date.
This protects the animal from diseases in new places, and it
protects you legally when you travel to a state with different
regulations. The doctor recommends taking your pet's health
certification records along. ``As a minimum, you'll need proof of
rabies vaccination if your pet bites someone during the trip.''
International regulations are usually much more stringent, so check
them before you leave.

   The ms Westerdam was relaunched in March after a $65 million
makeover transforming her into the largest cruise ship ever in
Holland America's fleet.
   The ship, formerly the Homeric, is namesake of one of the
best-known passenger ships of the post-World War II era.
   Capacity has been increased from 1,000 to 1,494 passengers with
the insertion of a 130-foot section at mid-ship. The company says
the expansion, carried out at the Meyer Werft shipyard in
Papenburg, West Germany, is the largest ever for a passenger ship.
   The ship's interior has been re-done, including the addition of
an 800-seat two-deck show lounge, expanded restaurant and meeting
facilities, and a new sports and sunbathing area on the topmost
deck. A collection of 17th and 18th century art evoking Dutch world
exploration, valued at more than $1 million, is part of the ship's
decor.
   First cruises were scheduled for Bermuda and the Caribbean. A
Panama cruise, featuring a daylight passage through the Canal, will
depart from New York in May and call at Ft. Lauderdale, St.Thomas,
V.I.; Castries, St. Lucia; Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela; Willemstad,
Curacao; Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico; Los
Angeles; San Francisco; and Vancouver. From Vancouver, the ship
will offer summer cruises to Alaska's Inside Passage.
   As the Homeric, the ship was acquired by Holland America in
l988. She was re-christened after the four-month transformation
which began last fall. The first Westerdam had an eventful history,
being sunk in Scheidam Harbor three times during World War II,
first during an Allied attack on the Nazi-held city in l940 and
twice in l944 by Dutch Resistance fighters to thwart her wartime
use by the enemy occupiers. The original Westerdam was raised after
the war and made her maiden transatlantic crossing to New York in
1946. She was retired and scrapped in l964. _
   The choice of air travel to Grenada will be wider for U.S.
travelers with the inauguration of American Airlines' daily service
to St. George's via its San Juan hub, beginning in late June.
Traffic will be handled through a new terminal being completed this
spring at Point Salines International Airport. _
   BWIA-International, the only other carrier with flights from the
U.S. to Grenada, also has added new schedules to Aruba, Curacao and
Martinique. The Caribbean-based airline operates 51 weekly flights
to the area from New York, Baltimore-Washington, Miami and Toronto.
_
   British Rail isn't part of the Eurailpass system, but for
travelers who want to visit both England and France, it has
introduced the BritFrance Railpass. This single pass is good for
travel on the entire British and French rail network, available for
any five days out of 15 or 10 days of a month. Prices start at
$199. The railroad also has inaugurated its InterCity 225 with a
link between London and the Midlands city of Leeds. It travels at
speeds of up to 140 mph and is the fastest train in Britain. _
   You don't have to sacrifice a tour guide's help while driving
yourself around the British Isles. The Silver Service package from
Kenning Car Rental includes a cassette which can be inserted into
the rental car's tape deck to point out the sights as you drive.
Tapes cover tours of London and the South; Manchester, the Midlands
and the North; and Scotland. The company also supplies road maps
and a directory of Tourist Information Centres around the country,
where the motorist can get local tourist information or
accommodation booking help. _

   Las Vegas goes back to the days of King Arthur and his knights
for the theme of its newest hotel and casino, the Excalibur, which
is scheduled for completion in June.
   Its owners, Circus Circus Enterprises, describe it as the
largest resort-hotel in the world, with 4,032 guest rooms in four
28-story towers. In keeping with the theme, Excalibur has a
drawbridge, a moat, spires, stone turrets and battlements. _
   Hyatt joined the Chicago all-suite market in April with the
opening of the 347-suite Hyatt Regency Suites on Michigan Avenue.
   Earlier this year, Hyatt acquired the Hyatt Regency Suites-Palm
Springs and is building another all-suite hotel in Charlotte, N.C.
   Hyatt Regency is busy in Hawaii, opening the 600-room Hyatt
Regency Kauai at the Poipu Beach resort in October and the Grand
Hyatt Wailea in November, with $6 million worth of water features,
including a 2,000-foot-long river pool with a ``water elevator.'' _
   Marriott is luring travelers to its Residence Inns with a weekly
barbecue on the patio. General managers and other staff members
grill outdoor meals for guests every Wednesday. _
   Afternoon tea. Scones. Watercress finger sandwiches. It looks
and tastes like England, but the venue is the Mayfair Regent
Chicago on East Lake Shore Drive, one of the latest hotels to add
teatime to its schedule.
   Formerly the Lake Shore Drive Hotel, it was bought by the
Heitman Group in 1979 when it underwent a $12 million renovation. _
   Guest Quarters Suite Hotel is set to open in mid-July on
Chicago's ``Magnificent Mile.'' _
   Inter-Continental Hotels added a companion 341-room Hotel
Inter-Continental next to its Forum Hotel in Chicago. _
   Walt Disney World opened the 758-room Swan hotel earlier this
year at its Lake Buena Vista site in central Florida and plans to
open the companion Walt Disney World Dolphin in July. The
1,509-room Dolphin is to be operated by the Sheraton Corp. _
   The 521-room Hawaii Prince hotel opens this spring on the
waterfront at the gateway to Waikiki, on the site of the demolished
Kaiser Medical Center. (The demolition was featured in an episode
of TV's ``Magnum P.I.'')
   Each of the twin 32-story towers of rose-colored glass and stone
contains 28 floors of guest rooms. The hotel fronts on the Ala Wai
yacht harbor. _
   Have a chocolate weekend. That's the theme of Manhattan East
Suite Hotels for April 27-29 in a promotion with Chocolatier
magazine. A two-night package at the Dumont Plaza in Manhattan will
include a champagne and chocolate reception, chocolate
demonstrations, a chocolate tasting, a late-night dessert buffet at
the Windows on the World restaurant and a chocolate brunch on
Sunday. _

   A continuing trend toward the shorter vacation, including
weekend breaks, continues to influence the travel and resort
business, according to those in the industry.
   One inn owner is offering spa ``breakations,'' short
one-to-five-day vacation packages including special fitness
programs.
   ``We've witnessed a tremendous change in recent years,'' says
Edward Safdie, owner of the Norwich, Conn., Inn and Spa. ``Guests
no longer book one- or two-week stays at the spa. Most of them just
don't have the time.''
   Safdie says the inn now offers shorter-stay programs and, for
weekend travelers, inn accommodations and use of the spa on an ``a
la carte'' basis.
   Many hotels, in cities from New York to Los Angeles, are
offering special package deals for weekend guests.
   Stouffer Hotels and Resorts, for example, promotes one- or
two-night weekends at its properties in Hawaii, the Virgin Islands,
California, Georgia, Florida and Arizona, with longer weekend
packages available at its Stanford Court in San Francisco and the
Mayflower in Washington, D.C.

   ``J'ai bien peur que l'heure du dner ne soit passe.'' (``I'm

breakfast.'')
   ``Rveillez-moi quand il arrivera.'' (``Wake me when it

   Suppose you want to use a smart lip in a foreign language. Now
you have help from a pair of phrasebooks from Workman Publishing _
``Wicked French for the Traveler,'' and ``Wicked Italian for the
Traveler,'' both by Howard Tomb.
   The pocket-sized books have aggressively clever remarks for all
travel occasions _ booking hotels, ordering food or wine, or hiring
a taxi. The author says travelers shouldn't be intimidated by rude
people in the host country.
   Another example, for overcoming your terror of taxis in Italy:
``Signore, se veramente vuole morire, la accontento.'' (``Sir, if
you truly have a death wish, I'll be happy to oblige you.'') _
   Food is a major attraction of France, and gourmets and gourmands
alike will find ``The Food Lover's Guide to Paris'' and ``A Food
Lover's Guide to France'' by Patricia Welles (Workman Publishing)
helpful in locating restaurants, pastry, cheese, chocolate and wine
shops, bakeries and specialty shops all over France. The book also
includes recipes from recommended food sources, as well as tips
about tips, credit cards, and booking.
   Also from Workman is ``Made in Italy,'' by Annie Brody and
Patricia Schultz, to tell you all about where and what to shop for
in Florence, Milan, Rome and Venice. _
   ``New York on $1,000 a Day (Before Lunch)'' by Ferne Kadish and
Shelley Clark (Passport Books) is a high-end compendium on the best
New York City has to offer in shopping, food, galleries, hotels and
transportation. _
   From a Japanese publisher comes a comprehensive guide, ``Gateway
to Japan,'' (Kodansha International) by June Kinoshita and Nicholas
Palevsky.
   Entries about Japanese culture, language, religion, history,
architecture, art, theater, and social mores are interspersed with
travel information. The authors have packed an immense amount of
detail in the 542-page paperback, including maps and transit
diagrams; phones, addresses, price ranges and hours of restaurants,
hotels and sites; practical information about coping with most
situations a traveler might encounter; and a one-hour Japanese
lesson.
   The authors, fluent in both English and Japanese, personally
visited nearly every site listed in the book. _
   Hikers who appreciate the heights can get helpful hints from
Sierra Club soft-cover books, ``Trekking in Pakistan and India''
and ``Trekking in Nepal, West Tibet, and Bhutan.'' The guides are
written by Hugh Swift and include information on pre-trip
preparation as well as tips on physical conditioning and route
planning. _
   The travel guide series, Berlitz Blueprint, launched in 1989,
this year adds Blueprint Greece and Blueprint Spain. The slick
paperback books feature excellent color photographs along with
basic sightseeing information by region, city maps, and other
practical information.
   Berlitz describes the books as ``designed for today's more
independent traveler.''
   One of the new Berlitz pocket country guides is ``Algeria.''
   Another new Berlitz guide is ``Handbook to Skiing the Alps,''
with information on 100 resorts in France, Germany, Austria, Italy
and Switzerland. _
   City travel kits, by Carole and William Halden, are selective
96-page guides to London, Paris, and Venice. Along with information
on tours and sites, each guidebook contains a color map of the
city, with street names, and is packaged in a plastic carrying
case. _
   Pocket-sized ``quick and easy'' guides from Bantam include 1990
versions of ``Miami'' and ``Hawaii.''
   The ``Ambience Vacation Guide: Hawaii,'' published by Robert
Erdmann, details hotels, condominiums and restaurants with ``an
emphasis on the important but usually ignored subject of
ambience.'' _
   For that modern breed, the frequent flyer, a new book aimed at
sorting out the field is available from Pegasus Books (and
co-published by Bonus Books): ``Official Frequent Flyer Guide
1990.'' Author Randy Peterson has compiled an updated sourcebook
tracking current programs and offers advice about maximizing
mileage points and minimizing travel costs. The guide comes in a
comprehensive desktop edition and an abridged pocket version. _
   Arthur Frommer, who has been producing travel guidebooks for 30
years, has a 1990 edition of ``New World of Travel,'' in which he
says he seeks ``to turn a spotlight on a host of little-known
travel programs and organizations that surface each year, usually
to benefit only the smallest portion of our population.''
   Frommer says he hopes each new edition of the guide will
introduce those travel companies with ``novel travel ideas: new
themes of travel, new travel methods, new programs, new vacation
possibilities, new and better ways of visiting old destinations,
new destinations.'' _
   A revised edition of ``Great Vacations with Your Kids'' stresses
family fun, from adventure vacations like bicycle trips, to resort
vacations, camping, and city vacations. _
   Langenscheidt Publishers has added four new titles to its
``Self-Guided'' series of travel titles designed for the
experienced traveler who wants to tour a country independently, by
car and on foot. The new ones are ``Alaska'' (for an outdoors
experience), ``Israel,'' ``Egypt'' (stressing tours along the Nile
and ancient sites), and ``European Cities'' (50 cities, including
Eastern Europe). _
   Updated editions of the ``22 Days in...'' series from John Muir
Publications include Hawaii, by Arnold Schuchter, Australia by John
Gottberg, New England by Anne E. Wright, and France by Rick Steves
and Steve Smith. The books suggest a series of itineraries,

   Owners of nearly 1.5 million timeshare condominiums rent out
their units without profit, according to a survey commissioned by
the Resort Property Owners Association.
   ``We've known for years that consumer owners have been renting
their property for peanuts. What we didn't know until this survey
was that the majority of consumer owners are renting these luxury
condos or villas for as little as $40 to $110 per night,'' says
Clinton Burr, RPOA president.
   The survey shows that 60 percent of consumer owners rent out
their condos at between $250 and $750 per week, and 65 percent of
these vacation condos are priced below hotel room rates in their
communities. ``This means that condo rentals in the most expensive
resort communities like Hawaii, Vail and Palm Springs have average
rental rates less than $100 a night for a one- or two-bedroom condo
with a kitchen. Travel agents and vacationers should consider condo
rentals when planning a vacation,'' says Burr.
   Despite the low return, 38 percent of the owners said they were
``satisfied,'' and another 23 percent said they were ``very
satisfied'' with property ownership. _
   If your life seems to revolve around a computer, then being able
to rent one on the road will help keep you connected. ``There's
always a short-term need for computers and computer peripherals,
but a lot of people who have this need are unaware they can rent,''
says George Reitsma, president of PCR Personal Computer Rentals. He
estimates the current market for renting to corporations and
individuals at about $250 million, shared by around 400 firms. His
company has 55 franchises around the country. For information, call
(800) 444-9930. _
   Business Travel International is the name of the new cooperative
formed by several travel companies to widen their services for
international customers. BTI will service global travel
arrangements for member companies, which include IVI Travel of
Northbrook, Ill.; Hapag-Lloyd Travel of Bremen, West Germany; Hogg
Robinson Travel of London; and Holland International of The Hague.
The new venture is based in The Hague. _
   If you like the outdoor life, want to save on hotel bills, and
prefer not to unload and reload luggage constantly, look into
caravanning by recreational vehicle for your vacation. Commercial
caravan companies or RV owners' groups can take the hassle out of
planning a trip, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry
Association. Acting as travel agents, they can organize your trip,
planning the route, taking care of visas and special permits,
vehicle and personal insurance, campground reservations and fees,
airline, ferry or train reservations and fares, and will supply
route information, itinerary and road guides. Tour guides at some
destinations and translators in foreign countries may be provided.
For a list of RV companies and clubs as well as other RV
information, contact RVIA, Box 2999, Dept. RK, Reston, Va. 22090. _
   Copley Place in Boston is site of the new Traveldays Book Shop,
second in the chain of travel book shops being opened by Doubleday
Book Shops. About 6,000 titles are available, including hardcover
and paperback books on international and national travel, maps,
guides, diaries, foreign language tapes, and special interest
publications. According to Gary P. DelVecchio, Doubleday Book
Shops' president, the travel shops are decorated to evoke the
elegance of luxury cruise ships, with marble, mahogany and etched
glass. ``The cash register areas look like a ship's bar, down to
the brass footrails,'' he says. A prototype Traveldays opened last
year in Columbus, Ohio, and the company says more branches are
planned. _
   If you want to include that other member of the family in the
vacation fun, there are two guides: ``Pets on the Go,'' written by
pet specialist Mordecai Siegal and offered free from Alpo Petfoods,
and ``Touring with Towser,'' for $1.50 from the Quaker Pet Care
Center.
   ``Traveling with animals is not as difficult as it may seem,''
Siegal writes in this booklet, which includes practical trips about
pet health and accomodations on the road.
   The 68-page book from Quaker, which makes Gaines and Ken-L
Ration products, lists names, addresses and phone numbers of 2,000
independently owned hotels and motels and ten chains with more than
4,000 locations that welcome pets. There's also a listing of pet
accommodations in areas where hotels and motels don't allow pets.
   For ``Pets on the Go,'' write to the Alpo Pet Center at P.O. Box
4000, Allentown, Pa. 18001. ``Touring with Towser'' is available
with a check or money order for $1.50 payable to Quaker
Professional Services, 585 Hawthorne Court, Galesburg, Ill. 61401. _

<HEAD>Factors to Consider When Buying Medigap Insurance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Medigap Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some important factors to consider
when shopping for medigap insurance, as suggested by the Senate
Special Committee on Aging.
   _ Review Medicare's gaps in coverage to determine what is
important to you in a supplement. Consider policy features,
premiums, waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, and
maximum benefit clauses.
   _ Work with hometown agents and companies you know. A company
must meet certain qualifications to do business in your state.
   _ Talk with friends who have had good claims experiences.
   _ Investigate group insurance sold by legitimate organizations.
But remember, some senior citizen or retired person organizations
are legitimate and some are set up as fronts to get your business.
While some of these plans are good deals, others are not as good as
individual plans.
   _ Take into consideration any other coverage you have that
continues beyond age 65.
   _ Consider how much you can afford to pay for hospital or
medical bills and how much you can afford for supplemental health
insurance premiums.
   _ As a general rule, buy one good comprehensive Medicare
supplemental policy. There are some exceptions if you have an
employer group policy that is affordable, but limited in benefits.
   _ Check for special circumstances for which the insurance
company may eliminate coverage for a health condition you had
before you bought the policy. A policy may refer to this as a
pre-existing condition.
   _ Beware of replacing existing coverage. Be suspicious of a
suggestion that you give up any policy and buy a replacement. Often
new policies will impose a waiting period or will have exclusions
and waiting periods for pre-existing conditions. This means you may
have to wait for up to six months before you will be eligible to
collect anything on a new policy.
   _ Beware of maximum benefits. Most policies have a limit on
benefits that may be expressed in dollars available or the number
of days for which payments will be made.
   _ Check your right to renew. Beware of policies that let the
company refuse to renew your policy on an individual basis. A
policy that is guaranteed renewable is preferable.
   _ Remember, policies to supplement Medicare are neither sold nor
serviced by state or federal governments. Do not believe statements
that insurance to supplement Medicare is government-sponsored.
   _ Don't pay cash. Write a check or money order payable to the
company, not the agent.
   _ Keep the agents' and-or companies' names, addresses and
telephone numbers so that you can contact them easily in case of
problems.
   _ The medigap insurance market is highly competitve. Take your
time. Do not let a short-term enrollment period pressure you, and
remember that some states prohibit special enrollment periods.

<DATELINE>HYDRO, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people at Lucille's Service Station have
pumped gas on Route 66 long enough to see history buffs start
getting mileage out of it.
   Eula Mae Brown, 67, remembers when it was something to have the
traveler perched on the Nehi icebox at her father's Hydro station
turn out to be from the East Coast.
   ``I always found it just exciting,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``Some of
the people who talked a different dialect would amuse me so.''
   Now the people who pull up to the pumps under the station's
old-fashioned clapboard overhang talk with British accents,
Australian accents.
   They ask Lucille Hamons to autograph her photograph in a glossy
book on Route 66 that confirms her status as living history. Mrs.
Hamons has run the station since her husband took it over in 1941,
14 years after Mrs. Brown's father built it.
   Mrs. Hamons sells sandwiches and soft drinks from her gas
station, and since 1966 also has sold what she calls the coldest
beer in Oklahoma.
   ``You know who will be coming here next, don't you? It'll be the
Japanese,'' Mrs. Hamons says, anticipating the next wave of
tourists on the highway that ran from Chicago to the West Coast.
   Tulsa writer Michael Wallis said he already has seen Japanese
among the tourists and filmmakers at barbecue joints and cafes
along Route 66 this year. Four independent filmmakers are working
on documentaries about the highway, he said.
   St. Martin's Press is due to publish Wallis' own book about the
road this spring. Wallis plans to tool down 66 in a 1964 Corvette
to promote it.
   Route 66 crosses eight states and three time zones, starting out
at the shores of Lake Michigan in Illinois. It makes its winding,
wooded way south from the lake, and from Oklahoma City on makes a
pretty straight shot through the western Plains and desert, over
the Rocky Mountains, and through arid country again to the beach at
Santa Monica.
   It opens to four lanes in spots, but is mainly a two-lane
highway, with curbs and curves that used to send Packards and
Plymouths spinning off the road and into tree trunks.
   Legislation is under way to make all 2,400 miles a national
monument. This winter, Kansas became the eighth and final state to
establish a Route 66 association, devoted to the 12 miles that hook
through its territory, Wallis said.
   Oklahoma tourism is catching on. Promoters plan a Route 66 car
rally and a Mr. and Mrs. Route 66 contest this summer. Businesses
are capitalizing on the ``Route 66'' moniker to sell everything
from art to antiques.
   Oklahoma could capitalize on Route 66 retaining more of its old
feel than it does in some other states, Wallis said.
   Oklahoma also happens to be the only state that earned a
qualitative statement in a song listing the quantity of cities
lining Route 66 (``... Saint Louey Joplin Missouri, And Oklahoma
City is mighty pretty. ...'').
   Bobby Troup thought up the song as he drove out to California
when he got out of the service. Pop singer Michael Martin Murphy is
putting it through its 25th recording, Wallis said.
   It's a song about getting your nostalgia kicks on Route 66.
   ``But this is a case where nostalgia has really symbolized the
best of something,'' Wallis said. ``It's still a corridor of
America that's not generic.''
   ``It's an America that's before fax machines and fern bars,
before the malling of America,'' he said. ``I remember when it was
an adventure, starting when Dad used to back the Plymouth down the
highway.''
   For Lucille's in Hydro, there were 40 years when ``I can't even
think how you could have left New York City and go to the coastline
without coming by our little store,'' Mrs. Brown said.
   She saw the first pioneers to try out the notion of a road that
let one drive from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean without once
having to stop to ask directions.
   Mrs. Hamons saw the exodus of Okies, distinguishable from the
Arkies, she said, by the single rather than the double layer of
mattresses on top of their cars. She saw the post-World War II
migration in which singer Troup took part, and supplied Nehis and
rented cabins to the tourists who followed.
   Mrs. Hamons started selling beer to survive after road crews
plowed up a temporary ramp leading off newly built Interstate 40,
parallel to 66, she said.
   She has a case for claiming the title of longest continually
operating merchant on Route 66 in Oklahoma. Fern bar and shopping
mall development hasn't spoiled her stretch of Route 66 because
there was little development money after the interstate came.
   Today, Mrs. Hamons sells Route 66 T-shirts, coffee mugs and
refrigerator magnets along with beer. She is thinking of opening
one of the tourist cabins out back to accommodate an expected
increase in trade this summer.
   ``It's what you've seen, and who you've come to know,'' she
said. ``To me, that's 66. It's not so much a money-making deal.
It's just memories.''
   ``It's memories to Lucille,'' Wallis said. ``It's making a buck
to everyone else.''
   ``Route 66 ... is and was a commercial proposition,'' Wallis
said. ``People trying to make a living selling postcards, tanks of
gas, a room for the night, greasy cheeseburgers, a look at the
snake pit.''
   Now, merchants from ``Saint Louey'' to San Bernadino are hawking
memories. Americans, Wallis said, are buying ``a chance to
rediscover themselves on the ribbon of time.''

<HEAD>Board Chairman Says Company Will Review Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a giant lending company says he's
taking steps to guard against cases like the one in which his
company tried to seize the home of an elderly, impoverished widow.
   Other loan files from Transamerica Financial Services'
Scottsdale office will be reviewed, but any problems are likely to
be local, said Arthur Van Leuven, chief executive officer of
Transamerica Financial Group and executive vice president of its
parent, Transamerica Corp.
   Transcripts of court testimony by a former loan officer
persuaded Transamerica to drop its fight with 77-year-old Lennie
Williams, Van Leuven said in a recent telephone interview.
   ``It was really not a hard decision,'' he said. ``It was a
slam-dunk.''
   The battle began after Mrs. Williams allowed her small,
42-year-old home to be used as security for a loan her son-in-law
took out from Transamerica Financial Services Inc., the
corporation's Arizona operation.
   The son-in-law disappeared with the money, according to court
records, and Transamerica began foreclosure on the home after Mrs.
Williams, who supports herself on pensions of $438 a month, was
unable to keep up with monthly loan payments of $499 a month.
   Volunteer lawyers fought back. The loan officer who handled Mrs.
Williams' loan testified that he doubted whether she understood
what she was doing, and a doctor who was treating her at the time
testified that she wasn't capable of remembering which pill to
take, much less of understanding loan agreements.
   Even after a Maricopa County Superior Court judge in January
ordered a temporary halt to the foreclosure and said it was likely
Transamerica ``knew or should have known'' something was wrong when
it made the loan, the company's lawyers pursued the case and
demanded that Mrs. Williams post bond of $450 a month pending trial.
   Last month, an Associated Press story detailed Mrs. Williams'
plight. At about the same time, senior officials at Transamerica
Financial Group received a transcript of the loan officer's
testimony, according to Van Leuven.
   ``It became apparent from that transcript that two parties had
been victimized,'' he said. ``Lennie Williams is one of them, and
Transamerica is the other.''
   The company decided to drop all proceedings against Mrs.
Williams and proceed only against the son-in-law because it is
``far easier for us to stand the victimization than for Lennie
Williams,'' Van Leuven said.
   The company will return payments Mrs. Williams made to the court
and will review other loans by its Scottsdale office to ensure
there aren't any similar cases, he said.
   The review will be difficult, because there was nothing in Mrs.
Williams' file to indicate an unusual transaction until her lawyers
began complaining, he said.
   Mrs. Williams' attorney, Michael Curran, said a tentative
agreement had been reached in her case.
   ``She was just completely relieved when we finally were able to
get it through to her that she was never going to have to worry
about someone taking her house again,'' said another of her
lawyers, Douglas Erickson.

<HEAD>Research Shows Some People Are Born with Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people are born with the belief
that they are masters of their own lives. Others feel they are at
the mercy of fate.
   New research shows that some of those feelings are in the genes.
   Psychologists long have known that people confident in their
ability to control their destinies are more likely to adjust well
to growing old than others.
   Two researchers who questioned hundreds of Swedish twins report
that such confidence, or lack of it, is partly genetic and partly
drawn from experience.
   They also found that the belief in blind luck _ that coincidence
plays a big role in life _ is something learned and has nothing to
do with heredity.
   The research was conducted at the Karolinska Institute, which
annually awards the Nobel Prize for medicine, by Karolinska's Nancy
Pedersen and Margaret Gatz, a psychology professor at the
University of Southern California. Their results recently were
published in the United States in the Journal of Gerontology.
   The study of twins, who have identical or similar genes,
eliminates genetics as the explanation of differences, said Richard
J. Rose, professor of psychology and medical genetics at Indiana
University. Variances in twins must then be attributed to their
distinct environment and experiences.
   The result of the Gatz-Pedersen study ``is consistent with other
world literature on the subject,'' but has the added importance of
being based on a far larger and more representative sample than
previous research, Rose said.
   ``The belief in your ability to control your life direction, or
the belief in your own competence, is 30 percent something you are
born with,'' said Gatz, interviewed during a consultation visit to
Sweden.
   People who are confident of their ability to control their lives
have an ``internal locus of control,'' and a better chance of being
well adjusted in old age, said Pedersen.
   An ``external locus of control,'' believing that outside forces
determine the course of life, has been linked to depression in
later years, she said.
   ``This is one of the windows on the aging process,'' said
Pedersen, who has published a series of studies on the genetics of
personality traits based on interviews with twins. The study on
life-control involved 554 pairs of twins.
   ``We are trying to understand what makes people different. What
makes some people age gracefully and others have a more difficult
time?'' she said. ``Whether people feel independent is an important
standard for service institutions and how they treat the elderly.''
   The study showed that while people have an inborn predilection
toward independence and self-confidence, about 70 percent of this
personality trait is affected by a person's environment and
experiences.
   Pedersen's studies, with various collaborators, probe the aging
process by comparing sets of twins, identical and fraternal, many
of whom were separated at an early age.
   The subjects were drawn from a roster first compiled about 30
years ago registering all twins born in Sweden since 1886. The
complete list, which was extended in 1971, has 95,000 sets of twins.
   Rose said the registry, based on the whole population, is ``an
unusually powerful tool.'' U.S. researchers have nothing
comparable, and normally rely on twins who respond to
advertisements.
   Karolinska Professor Anders Ahlbom, who runs the registry, said
80 percent to 85 percent of twins typically respond to
questionnaires sent by researchers.
   Pedersen said that studies of twins who were reared separately
but have identical or nearly identical genes, compared with twins
reared together, can yield a unique measure of nature-vs.-nurture
in human development.
   Earlier research by Pedersen showed that a variety of other
characteristics are 30 percent to 40 percent determined by a
person's genetic makeup, including many of those traits comprising
what has become known as Type A behavior.
   The Type A person _ the hard-driving worker who brings home his
work from the office, eats too fast, keeps his foot on the clutch
at traffic lights and makes a point of being on time _ has been
found to have a higher risk of heart disease before age 65.

<HEAD>Bill Would Allow Older First Cousins to Marry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older first cousins who got married in New Mexico
are asking the Legislature to change Arizona law so their marriage
is legal here.
   A bill, which would apply to couples over 65, cleared the House
recently and was sent to the Senate on a 40-20 vote.
   Rep. Lela Steffey said she introduced the bill on behalf of Ruth
and Henry Hinkley, who were married last year and have been unable
to persuade the state Office of Veterans Affairs to recognize the
marriage, which could jeopardize their veterans' benefits, Mrs.
Steffey said.
   ``A lot more people support it than I had anticipated because
there's no harm to it,'' Mrs. Steffey said.
   Indeed, at least one other lawmaker said the bill might not go
far enough. Rep. Margaret Updike noted that some states allow first
cousins to marry without age restrictions.
   Mrs. Steffey said she chose 65 as a cutoff because she had heard
that the oldest woman to become pregnant was 58, and she wanted to
ensure there could be no offspring.
   State law prohibits marriage between parents and children,
siblings, uncles and nieces, aunts and nephews and first cousins.
It is intended to reduce the risk of children being born with
genetic problems.
   Although the bill was criticized as legislation intended to
benefit one couple, Mrs. Steffey said she has heard from several
cousins in similar situations.
   One New Jersey couple learned about Arizona's marriage
restriction during a recent visit and delayed plans to move here
pending passage of Mrs. Steffey's bill, she said.
   Mrs. Steffey said she believes that because 29 other states
allow first cousins to marry in some situations that there may be
many more cousins in Arizona who either have kept their marriage
secret or who don't realize such marriages are not recognized here.
   Mrs. Hinkley, who is 72, has hit roadblocks in trying to care
for her 89-year-old husband, who is blind, nearly deaf and has had
one leg amputated, Mrs. Steffey said.
   The state's failure to recognize the marriage also could keep
Mrs. Hinkley from receiving benefits should her husband die, Mrs.
Steffey said.
   Mrs. Steffey said she recommended the couple consider moving
back to New Mexico.
   ``She could move back, that probably wouldn't be any big
problem,'' Mrs. Steffey said. ``But he couldn't move. He's in
extremely poor shape. He's in a nursing home here.''

   Do you remember, as a kid, your mother saying, ``As soon as you
eat your brownies you can have your peas and carrots?'' No way.
   You had to push through some usually overcooked and
under-seasoned canned or frozen vegetables to get to dessert.
Sometimes salads stood in for the vegetable, but front and center
was meat and potatoes.
   Now for optimum health we are encouraged to eat richly and in
greater variety from the vegetable kingdom. How do we proceed? As
one friend of mind said over lunch, ``I know Fred and I should be
eating more vegetables, but how do you make them interesting?'' If
you head to your local bookstore or public library, vegetable
cookbooks are taking up not one shelf, but whole units of shelving
offering thousands of recipes from every culture, including our own.
   At our supermarkets more and more space is given over to fresh
produce, with exotic fruits and vegetables from around the world,
often tagged with a recipe on how to use them. When you stop to
think about it, almost all regional and international favorites
feature a preponderance of vegetables, grains, beans, even fruits.
Meat is a component that is excluded or included; the most
appearing on feast days.
   Whether it's couscous, curries, or cassoulet, the seasonings
define the dish. Two of my favorites are vegetable curry and black
bean chili. I also enjoy vegetables in different ways at each meal.
As entree and as salad (say a stir fry and a slaw), or as a
container (squash or peppers filled with grains, beans, vegetables
or meat). Fermented black bean sauce or pesto goes over fish,
chicken and pasta. Old-fashioned pickled beets and cucumbers, or
the new variety of fresh salsas as condiments. And as a year-round
entree, vegetable salad.
   Whenever possible, buy from green farms in your city or
farmstands. When you buy at the supermarket, experiment with a
fruit or vegetable that is new to you. For familiar vegetables, ask
the manager if they are dyed or waxed. Taking creative
responsibility for your health is essential.

<HEAD>Five Years Worth Investing for Good Asparagus Eating</HEAD>

   Asparagus has sublime flavor, beauty,
lineage _ in a word, class _ and a gardner who achieves a
well-established bed gets respect.
   A would-be asparagus grower needs patience and determination. It
takes a good five years to have harvests worth talking about.
   In a mobile society, this eliminates a lot of people. Who's
going to plant a vegetable for some future tenant to enjoy? But if
you've settled down, or retired, an asparagus bed is a gilt-edged
investment producing abundantly and requiring little effort to
maintain.
   Asparagus ranks as one of the oldest vegetables, little
different in its cultivated state from the wild spears of remote
ages. Menus recovered from the ruins of Pompeii show the Romans
enjoyed young asparagus as a spring delicacy.
   My own 21-year-old patch, a mere child in the annals of
asparagus longevity, yielded 702 fat, thin and medium-size spears
in 1989, 586 in 1988 and 607 in 1987. That's a lot of asparagus out
of a 15-by-10-foot bed, more than the needs of my wife and me, and
we gave much of it to our neighboring son.
   In terms of waiting, think of asparagus as an apple tree or
blueberry bush. Unlike most vegetables, which you plant anew every
year, asparagus is perennial. After you've first dug in the roots,
they bear year after year. European chronicles tell of 100-year-old
asparagus beds bestowed as dowries in marriage contracts.
   Asparagus thrives everywhere in the United States except areas
of the Deep South and West, where winters are too mild. In my
garden, 50 miles north of New York City, asparagus starts coming up
in late April and yields continuously until mid-June. Then I stop
cutting and let the spears grow to handsome ferns, as tall as eight
feet, which feed the roots for next year's crop.
   One of the joys of asparagus is its early arrival. You've hardly
started getting the rest of the garden ready for summer and here
you are harvesting a delicious vegetable. Another plus is that the
spears come up a few at a time. Thus you have prolonged harvests.
   Once out of the ground, a spear grows incredibly fast _ as much
as 10 inches in a day. Six to eight inches is a good cutting
height. After that, the spears get woody at the base.
   Asparagus may be grown from seed, but you save time by planting
roots acquired at nurseries or seed houses. Worldwide, about 35
varieties are cultivated. In the United States, the best known are
Mary and Martha Washington, introduced early this century. Recently
new, all-male cultivars with names like Jersey Giant have appeared
and are getting good reviews for larger yields and better disease
resistance.
   Because of the time involved in establishing a bed, however, it
wouldn't be practical for some of us to experiment with different
varieties. My Martha Washington keeps producing generously. I'll
leave new cultivars to new gardeners.
   The most work you'll probably ever do with asparagus comes at
the start _ in planting the roots. In early spring, in a
well-tilled, sunny spot, you dig trenches about a foot deep and a
foot wide in rows about three feet apart. Pack the bottom of the
trenches with well-rotted manure or compost, mounding this up, and
spread the roots over the mounds about two feet apart. Then you
bury the roots, leaving the crowns two to three inches below the
surface. Sixteen roots should be plenty for a family of three.
   In this first year, you'll get some thin spears. Leave these
alone, too. You can start cutting the third year, but it will be a
while after that before you have a really prolific bed.
   In the meantime, your biggest problem will be weeds. How do you
remove them without disturbing the asparagus roots? I solved this
by mulching the bed with a couple of inches of salt hay, obtainable
in bales from nurseries. The mulch stifles weeds, but allows spears
to come through. Then it decomposes into fine compost, helping the
fertility of the bed. I put on a bale a year.
   In the middle of June, when I stop cutting, I push the mulch
aside and spread some fertilizer around the spears. Then I push the
mulch back on. Except for a little dusting to deal with insects,
that's all I do. The ferns die back in the fall and I wait for the
cycle to begin again with that first great taste of newborn
asparagus next April.

<HEAD>Buying a Hearing Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report from the American Association of
Retired Persons has been published to help people who need a
hearing aid.
   ``Far too many people allow a hearing loss to limit their
lives,'' said AARP Executive Director Horace B. Deets. ``The
purchase of a hearing aid can make a tremendous difference.''
   The first step, the report says, is to visit a doctor. Hearing
loss can be a symptom of a treatable problem, such as diabetes, and
a hearing aid could mask that problem.
   Hearing aids are sold by physicians, audiologists and hearing
aid dealers. And there are three kinds of hearing aids:
behind-the-ear models, those that go in the ear, and those that fit
in the ear canal.
   Prices range from $500 to $2,000.
   The AARP report considers the anatomy of the ear and causes of
hearing loss, what to consider when seeing a specialist, questions
to ask about hearing aids, and other sources of information.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Young Adults Value Ties to Grandparents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young adults see their grandparents as a
stabilizing factor during times of family trouble, especially
grandchildren from single-parent households, according to a survey
of college students.
   ``Grandparenthood today is a very present aspect in family life,
not only for young children but for young adults as well,'' Gregory
E. Kennedy of Central Missouri State University reported.
   Kennedy surveyed 704 college students under age 23 in 1988 and
found that students tended to feel closer to their mothers' parents
than to their fathers' parents. They also tended to be closer to
grandmothers than to grandfathers.
   The results were reported in the February issue of The
Gerontologist, published by the Gerontological Society of America.
   Ten percent of those who felt closest to a grandmother
identified their relationship as ``intimately close,'' while 26
percent said ``very close'' and 28 percent said ``close.''
   Four percent of those who felt closest to a grandfather said
their relationship was ``intimately close,'' with 15 percent saying
they were ``very close'' and 21 percent saying they were ``close.''
   When family background was analyzed, the survey results
suggested ``single-parent and blended families experienced
grandparents as being more involved and influential in their family
than did students from intact families,'' the study said.

<HEAD>Rising Health-Care Costs a Financial Drain on Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's elderly are losing ground
financially as rising health care costs consume ever-larger shares
of their income, according to a study by the House Select Committee
on Aging.
   The report said any advantage that the elderly may have by
entering retirement with higher incomes than a decade ago will be
quickly lost as health and long-term care costs absorb larger
portions of their income.
   ``While virtually all lower- and middle-income Americans feel
some pressure from these costs, the problem is acute for people
whose incomes rise no faster than overall inflation,'' said
committee Chairman Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif.
   The report found that people retiring in any given year will see
health-care costs rise more than 1{ times faster than their income.
Out-of-pocket health care costs rose from 12.3 percent of elderly
income in 1977 to 18.2 percent in 1988, it said.
   ``All indications are that this trend of costs outpacing income
will continue into the foreseeable future and that health costs are
likely to reach 20 percent of elderly income by the early 1990s,''
the study said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government has issued guidelines to help
ensure that new drugs are adequately tested to determine their
effects on older people.
   ``There is widespread agreement that many drugs, even those
likely to be used in the elderly, have not always been extensively
studied in elderly patients,'' the Food and Drug Administration
said in a public notice. ``As a consequence, there has often been
little information available to guide therapy in such patients.''
   The agency issued ``Guideline for the Study of Drugs Likely to
be used in the Elderly.''
   The publicaton was welcomed by Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., who
said they were overdue given growing concerns about mismedication
and drug misuse among the elderly.
   ``The health and welfare of millions of older Americans depends
on a serious commitment by the FDA to ensure that available drug
therapy is safe and effective,'' Downey said.

<HEAD>Chairman Says Defense Backlog Will Protect Westinghouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A backlog of $5 billion in defense orders
ensures the nation's cuts in military spending will have a slow
impact on Westinghouse Electric Corp., the company's chief said.
   Prior to the recent talk of a peace dividend, Westinghouse has
had a goal of reducing its reliance on defense, Chairman John C.
Marous said.
   Management last year committed to spending $100 million
internally to develop 19 defense programs that have the potential
to grow into $1 billion businesses, Marous said. But Westinghouse
is counting on only three of those to reach that level.
   Even so, Marous warned Congress must ensure spending cuts don't
cripple development of technology.
   ``There's no question there's going to be some form of a peace
dividend,'' he told Pittsburgh financial analysts Friday. ``I think
the real key, though, is how they cut the defense budget because
there's two pieces.''
   People and bases are one piece, technology the other, Marous
said.
   ``The technology lead this country has today rests primarily in
the military and space program,'' he said. ``If we start cutting in
the technology area, which politically is the easy thing to do,
we're going to have problems.''
   Marous said he presented his arguments on technology with Vice
President Dan Quayle, who was in Pittsburgh recently.
   Westinghouse, the nation's 13th largest defense contractor,
won't be hurt by defense cuts because it has positioned itself in
programs that it believes will be spared the knife, the chairman
said.
   Three years ago, 22 percent of the business of Westinghouse's
defense systems group was non-defense. Marous set a goal of
increasing that share to 50 percent by 1995 and changed the
division's name to the electronic systems group to emphasize the
change.
   Westinghouse plans to apply its defense technology to
non-defense businesses in areas such as air-traffic control, Marous
said. In the past month, Westinghouse won the job to develop an air
traffic control system in Poland and it is bidding for the same job
in Czechoslovakia, he said.
   In other areas, Marous said industrial and environmental
services ``is probably the fastest growing business in
Westinghouse,'' expanding at a rate of 30 percent a year.

   Corporate raiders and junk bond traders aren't
the only ones to hit some rough bumps. Makers of stretch
limousines, a power symbol in the status-conscious 1980s, are
struggling as demand has shifted into low gear.
   Stretch limousine production has dropped off from the boom times
during the Reagan years, when production jumped from about 2,500
limousines a year in 1980 to a peak of about 7,000 in 1987.
   Some 57 coach-building companies, including two in the Chicago
area, now stretch only about 5,700 limousines a year, according to
Limousine and Chauffeur, the industry trade magazine.
   Stretch limousines were an ostentatious symbol of wealth in the
money decade of the 1980s.
   ``Some corporations were spending up to $20,000 a week on
round-the-clock limo service,'' said Wayne Smith, executive
director of the National Limousine Association in Washington, D.C.
   ``Executives were doing multibillion-dollar deals, and the limo
service played a role in beefing up the company's image,'' he said.
   But a slower economy, troubles in the junk-bond market, the
savings and loan fiasco and a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions
all have contributed to cuts in corporate limousine service. Some
budget-minded companies are trying to prune expensive frills.
   ``The ostentatious look just isn't good for the corporate image
anymore,'' said Joseph V. Scaletta, president of Moloney
Coachbuilders in Chicago.
   Sales are down about 25 percent at Moloney, which makes about
450 stretch limos a year. Scaletta attributes the drop to
``overbuilding.''
   But Scaletta believes it is still possible to find other markets.
   ``Executives aren't going for the super-stretches anymore,''
said Scaletta. ``But now that we are adding cellular phones, fax
machines and even small computers, they see the benefit of having a
traveling office.''
   Another Chicago-area manufacturer, Limousine Werks of
Schaumburg, says it has looked to the foreign market.
   Company president Matthew Baines says sales are up 28 percent
over last year, in part due to a recent contract to make stretch
Cadillac limousines for Japan. He estimates production at about
``one a day.''
   The first limousine was a Model G made in 1908 by Cadillac, said
Dave John, Cadillac fleet director in Detroit.
   In the 1960s, as buyers increasingly demanded custom flourishes,
the major auto makers stopped customizing limousines and
independent companies, known as coach builders, entered the scene.
   These companies buy Cadillacs, Lincoln Continentals or other
luxury cars as a ``coach builder package'' without a roof. Then
they cut the cars in half, stretch them by 8 inches to as much as
100-plus inches and fill them with whatever luxuries customers
want, from televisions and mini-bars to chandeliers and hot tubs.
   A Cadillac Brougham at Limousine Werks costs from $53,000 to
$62,000. Mercedes go for $135,000, and armored cars start at
$100,000.
   Changing times also have affected companies offering limousine
service. The airport trade is now their bread-and-butter, so they
are positioning themselves as an affordable alternative to a taxi.
   The airport trade accounts for 80 percent of the rides provided
by the American Limousine Corp. of suburban Burr Ridge, which has a
fleet of 150 cars, said owner George Jacobs, who is also president
of the National Limousine Association.
   But Jacobs believes the limousine will always stand for luxury
and romance.
   He recalls one young suitor who ordered two limousines when he
wanted to propose to his girlfriend.
   ``The first car took him to the lakefront, where he proposed.
The second car came to pick up the first driver so the couple could
be alone for a few hours,'' said Jacobs. ``We didn't ask any
questions.''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in nervous trading in Europe
late this morning as economic and political concerns pressured the
yen, sterling and the West German mark.
   Gold prices fell.
   A 6.8 percent decline on the Tokyo stock market earlier today
put the yen under renewed pressure and unsettled the world currency
and equity markets, traders said.
   Violent protests in London over the weekend against a new
per-capita tax sent sterling falling more than 2 cents against the
dollar.
   News that Germany plans a two-for-one exchange rate between the
East and West German mark undermined the West German currency.
   ``The dollar is largely benefiting from the weakness of the yen
and Europe's problems,'' one Milan trader said. ``The dollar isn't
being sold, but its not as though U.S. economic data is
particularly inspiring.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 2.30 yen to a closing 159.95 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a slightly lower rate of 159.93 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7030 West German marks, up from 1.6875; 1.5055
Swiss francs, up from 1.4935; 5.7240 French francs, up from 5.6765;
1.9160 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9008; 1,252.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,243.25; and 1.1701 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1700.
   In London, the pound was quoted at $1.6260, compared with
$1.6465 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $368.75 a troy ounce,
down from $369.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368, down from $368.75 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 2 cents to close at a bid
$371.16.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.96 a troy ounce from
Friday's $4.97.

<HEAD>Columbia Savings Insolvent, Reports Huge Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association, the once-high flying thrift that invested billions of
dollars in high-risk junk bonds, says it lost $379 million in the
fourth quarter and $200 million during the first two months of this
year and is now insolvent.
   The disclosure on Sunday increases the prospects for an
expensive federal bailout.
   Columbia had been one of the nation's most profitable S&amp;Ls due
to its large portfolio of high-yielding junk bonds, many of which
were bought from Michael Milken and his securities firm, the
now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
   In the mid-1980s Columbia's annual earnings approached $200
million.
   But the deterioration in the junk bond market over the past
several months has forced Columbia to write off much its holdings,
resulting in huge losses.
   Columbia said it lost $379 million, or $19.17 a share, in the
final quarter of 1989, compared to earnings of $16 million, or 37
cents a share, in 1988. Losses for the entire year came to $591
million, or $30.11 a share, vs. net income of $65 million, or $1.49
per share, the previous year.
   The losses reflect junk bond-related loss provisions and
write-downs of about $500 million in the fourth quarter.
   The company said that its shareholders' equity, or the firm's
value to its stockholders, fell to minus $121 million at Feb. 28,
1990, ``rendering (Columbia) insolvent under generally accepted
accounting principles.'' Just three months earlier Columbia had
equity of $77.6 million.
   In a statement, Columbia said it expected ``significant
additional loss reserves and other asset writedowns will occur in
March 1990.'' It said it had a loss of nearly $200 million in the
first two months of 1990 because of further problems in the junk
bond market.
   But Columbia is hoping to avoid federal receivership by
liquidating its junk bond holdings.
   ``We have initiated programs to reduce overhead significantly
and to improve our traditional thrift operations,'' Edward G.
Harshfield, the thrift's newly appointed chief exectuvie, said in a
statement Sunday.
   Between August and February, Columbia sold about $575 million in
junk bonds and other securities, according to the company.
   Federal regulators had imposed restrictions on Columbia in
November because of problems with its $3.8 billion junk-bond
portfolio had caused the thrift's capital to be ``substantially
inadequate.'' The Office of Thrift Supervision restricted, among
other things, Columbia's growth, dividend payment and loan funding.
Lending is now limited to residential loans not exceeding $500,000.
   Columbia's assets for 1989 totaled $9.3 billion, down from $12.7
billion in 1988. The thrift has 950 employees in 29 Southern
California offices.

   Stock prices fell today as the market absorbed
the jolt of another big selloff in Japan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 18.02 to
2,689.19 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 210 up,
1,143 down and 390 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.39 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Tokyo stock market took a 6.6 percent drop overnight,
suffering the steepest decline yet in an early-1990 slide that has
sent prices to an 18-month low.
   In recent weeks the decline has had few ripple effects in U.S.
markets. Analysts have ascribed it to predominantly local forces in
Japan, including rising interest rates and lofty price-earnings
ratios.
   Some observers, in fact, have argued that a bad showing in Tokyo
might actually serve to prop up the American market by luring money
to Wall Street looking for a safe haven.
   But lately a good many analysts in this country have confessed
to worries that continued erosion in Tokyo might sooner or later
start to undermine confidence in other financial centers as well.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped { to

   American General lost 2| to 36. Torchmark Corp. said it had
withdrawn an offer to acquire the company through an exchange of

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.44 to 185.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.66 at 359.09.

<TEXT>
   High-level trade talks between Japan and the
United States resumed today as Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu dispatched two personal emissaries to try to work out
solutions to the huge $49 billion trade imbalance between the two
nations.
   Kaifu called Bush to renew his pledge to seek solutions to the
trade disputes that have split the two nations. He told Bush that
he was sending the two emissaries to Washington ``to express the
prime minister's personal commitment to solving problems,'' the
White House announced.
   Bush, asked by reporters in Atlanta if the trade talks with
Japan were in trouble, said:
   ``I had a very fruitful conversation with the prime minister of
Japan this morning and we will see. But I must say I am encouraged
by recent progress, but we'll wait and see. More to follow soon on
that.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in
Atlanta that the two emissaries, former Japanese Ambassador Nobuo
Matsunaga and Deputy Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada, would meet
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Fitzwater said the emissaries would meet with Bush on Wednesday.
   The discussions were being held as other U.S. and Japanese
negotiators were resuming talks aimed at addressing broad-scale
barriers to trade in both nations.
   The Bush administration is pinning its hopes on making
significant reductions in the trade deficit with Japan _ which
accounted for almost half of America's total trade imbalance last
year _ on the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative, which
take place today and Tuesday.
   There were reports that the Japanese were bringing a new set of
concessions with them designed to open their markets to sales of
American products.
   Over the weekend, negotiators said both sides are close to
agreement on proposals to expand sales of American-made satellites
to Japanese government agencies. The agreement was similar to an
accord reached a week ago on the issue of supercomputer sales to
Japanese universities and other government agencies.
   And late on Friday, U.S. and Japanese negotiators announced
agreement on steps that would further open the Japanese market to
American-made telecommunications products. The new pact was reached
just before a Saturday deadline that could have triggered U.S.
retaliation.
   Today's phone call between Bush and Kaifu represented a
follow-up to a summit meeting held last month in California at
which the two leaders searched for ways to get the stalled trade
talks moving again.
   American negotiators expressed disappointment that three
previous rounds of discussions on structural barriers produced
little progress. Both sides must produce an interim report by
mid-April and a final report before the seven-nation economic
summit, to be held this year in Houston in July.
   The structural impediments discussions are just one of a set of
trade negotiations currently underway with Japan. The Japanese are
facing a June 16 deadline to open up markets in three specific
product areas _ satellites, supercomputers and lumber _ or risk
economic retaliation by the Bush administration.

   The key index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange took its
second-largest plunge ever today as the dollar surged to a
three-year high against the Japanese yen.
   Analysts said both markets were shaken by a report in Japan's
top financial newspaper that major life insurance companies planned
to shift funds out of the stock market.
   The drop in stock prices helped spark a decline on stock markets
in New York, London and several Far Eastern cities.
   In its lead front-page story, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper
said major insurance firms, including Dai-ichi Mutual Life
Insurance Co., Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Sumitomo Mutual Life
Insurance Co., planned to sell largeblocks of shares because the
ratio of their stock holdings to their total assets was approaching
the upper limit of 30 percent set by the Finance Ministry.
   The Finance Ministry and at least one insurer denied the report,
which nevertheless supported market expectations that major
investors would generally move out of the stock market and into
bonds, said Jason James, strategist at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues today shed
1,978.38 points, or 6.59 percent, to 28,002.07, its second largest
single-day decline ever.
   On Friday, it lost 1,045.71 points, or 3.37 percent, in the
market's seventh largest single-day decline.
   Analysts said the decline in the stock market helped push the
dollar higher, and the relative weakness of the yen then pushed
share prices even lower.
   An official at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance said the report
was misleading because the company planned to buy 800 billion yen
of stocks in fiscal 1990 after selling 200 billion yen's worth of
shares.
   ``We'd reduce our holdings of shares with large losses and those
we possess in excessive amount, many of which will be bank
shares,'' said Kimitoshi Hasegawa, deputy vice president
supervising separate account management at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life
Insurance Co.
   On Wall Street, stock prices declined broadly in response to the
drop on the Japanese market. The Dow Jones industrial average was
off 15.99 to 2,691.22 as of 11:30 a.m. EST.
   In London, analysts said the plunge in Tokyo and violent riots
against a new per-capita tax sent prices sharply lower. At midday,
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was 32.3 points,
or 1.4 percent, lower at 2,215.6.
   Stock prices closed lower in Australia, Hong Kong, the
Philippines, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, largely in
reaction to the dismal Tokyo performance.
   In the Tokyo currency market, the dollar closed at 159.95 yen,
up 2.30 yen from Friday's close of 157.65 yen. It opened at 159.97,
up 2.32 yen, and ranged between 159.70 and 160.35.
   About 30 minutes after trading began, the dollar was trading
between 160.10 yen and 160.20 yen, the first time the currency has
traded in the 160-yen range since December 1986.
   ``People had already taken their positions by the time the
report was denied, and anyway people were expecting (the shift away
from stocks) to come sooner or later,'' said Kaneo Ogino of Goldman
Sachs (Japan) Corp.
   The dollar later fell back on short-covering, Ogino said.
   The speed and extent of the dollar's rise took many market
players by surprise, dealers said.
   ``Traders were looking at 160.40 yen as a medium term objective
over the next few weeks. Many people were surprised when we reached
the target today,'' said Mahiko Nagai, an assistant vice president
of foreign exchange with Manufacturers Hanover in Tokyo.
   Dealers predicted volatile trading this week ahead of a meeting
of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations in Paris on Saturday.
   Concern over the outcome of U.S.-Japan talks on ending so-called
structural impediments to trade could push the U.S. currency
higher, they said.
   Officials of both countries are expected within the next two
weeks to issue an interim report on the talks aimed at identifying
and removing business practices and laws that contribute to the $49
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bond was at 86.02 by late afternoon, down slightly from
Friday's close of 86.11. Its yield rose to 7.35 percent from the
previous session's 7.330 percent.

<TEXT>
   General Development Corp. said today it was unable
to reach agreement on obtaining interim credit from its lenders and
was considering filing for bankruptcy protection.
   The Miami-based developer, which has pleaded guilty in federal
court to mail-fraud conspiracy in connection with the overpricing
of homes it built, has been seeking $60 million in interim credit
for three weeks, but talks broke off last weekend, the company said
in a news release.
   ``The company is considering all alternatives available to it,
including seeking protection under the federal bankruptcy laws,''
the release said.
   Company spokesman Otis Wragg was not immediately available for
further comment, a receptionist said.
   General Development, creator of nine Florida communities,
earlier estimated it would cost about $400 million to finish
developing its land, but only $102.1 million is budgeted for
improvements, according to its latest annual report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   United Capital Corp., a minority stockholder, offered a
restructuring plan involving the sales of assets and short-term
operating money last week, but General Development did not respond
publicly to the offer.
   General Development pleaded guilty last month in connection with
charges it misled customers and overpriced nearly 10,000 homes.
Class-action suits against the company involve 60,000 buyers.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of
business-related actions taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PUNITIVE DAMAGES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether huge punitive damage awards
in lawsuits may violate constitutional guarantees of fundamental
fairness.
   The court said it will consider overturning a $1 million award
and three smaller awards to Alabama residents who successfully sued
an insurance company for fraud.
   The case, of enormous importance to American business, is likely
to be decided in 1991.
   The case is Pacific Mutual vs. Haslip, 89-1279.
   
   AUTO SAFETY
   
   The court let stand rulings that protect automobile
manufacturers from design-defect lawsuits for not installing
airbags.
   The justices, without comment, refused to revive three such
suits against General Motors, one against Honda and one against
Nissan. Three federal appeals courts and a California state court
ruled in favor of the car makers.
   The cases are Wood vs. GM, 89-46; Kitts vs. GM, 89-279; Taylor
vs. GM, 89-852; and Meier vs. Nissan, 89-940.
   
   AIRLINES
   
   The court left intact a ruling airlines say could make it more
difficult for them to merge.
   The court, without comment, refused to shield Delta Air Lines
from binding arbitration that could lead to a monetary-damages
award for a flight attendants union.
   The case is Delta vs. Association of Flight Attendants, 89-459.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After posting the usual first-quarter declines,
the number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs made a turnaround this
week, increasing by 53 to total 946.
   The rig count climbed by a dozen or more in three states, and
other areas also posted slight gains, Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Monday.
   This week's increase reversed the rig count's downward slide _ a
traditional trend in the first three months of the year. Last week,
the count dropped by 15 to 893.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   A year ago, the rig count totaled 779.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas had the greatest
increase with 15, Oklahoma followed with 13 and Lousiana's count
climbed by 12.
   Wyoming's count was up six, North Dakota's increased by four and
Colorado and New Mexico each gained three more rigs. Ohio's count
was up two and California was up by one.
   Michigan lost three rigs and Pennsylvania lost ten rigs.

   Share prices finished lower on London's Stock
Exchange Monday, shaken by Tokyo's plunge earlier in the day and by

   But a round of last-minute buying helped prices come off their

At its worst, the index showed a 36.3 point decline.

   The U.S. company's 1989 sales of about $1 billion ranked it
fifth in the lucrative U.S. copier market behind Cannon, Xerox,
Sharp and Mita, according to Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif.-based
market research firm. All but Xerox are Japanese companies.
   Ricoh's separate consumer products division, based in Fairfield,
handles the company's cameras, video recorders and other
photographic equipment.
   Kubo replaces Keiji Endoh, who has been appointed managing
director of the parent company in charge of commercial affairs.

<HEAD>Families' Ability to Buy House Up in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the typical American
family's ability to buy a house increased in February as lower
prices and rising income offset higher mortgage rates, a real
estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its index rose to
105.1 in February, meaning that a family with a median income of
$33,816 had 105.1 percent of the income needed to buy a
median-priced existing home costing $95,400.
   The median means half of the families earn more and half less,
or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less.
   The index measured 108.2 in December but slipped to 104.2 in
January.
   ``The February increase in overall affordability conditions, in
part, reflects the lower-priced homes frequently available during
the winter months,'' said NAR President Norman D. Flynn.
   ``Although the lower median home price and rise in family income
last month had a favorable impact on affordability conditions, the
index would have been stronger if mortgage interest rates had
remained unchanged,'' he added.
   The median price for a house dropped $900 from January's $96,300
while median family income was up $108 from $33,708 the previous
month, the realtors' group said. The income needed to qualify for a
loan on the typical home dropped $192 to $32,160.
   The interest rate used to compute the index, however, rose from
9.7 percent in January to 10.04 percent in February, the realtors
said. The association uses a composite rate reflecting both
fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The changes lowered the monthly principal and interest payment
on a median-priced home by $2 to $672 in February. The payment
represents 23.8 percent of the median family's income.
   Flynn said that while overall affordability remains favorable,
entry-level buyers face difficulties.
   ``These individuals are at a disadvantage in that they often
can't save enough money for a downpayment and lack any home equity
buildup to leverage a home purchase,'' he said.
   Under February's affordability conditions, a family earning
$20,000 would have sufficient income to qualify for a $59,300 home
using a $47,400 loan. A family earning $30,000 would qualify for a
$88,900 home with a $71,100 loan.
   The realtors said a family earning $40,000 would have sufficent
income to qualify for a $118,500 home with a $94,800 loan and a
family with a $50,000 income would qualify for a $148,100 home
using a $118,500 loan.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Up in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending on residential, non-residential and
government construction projects all increased in February, the
government said Monday, helped for the second straight month by
mild weather over much of the country.
   The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 2.6
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $436.5 billion.
That followed a revised 2.5 percent jump in January, which first
had been reported to have been a 1.8 percent gain.
   Spending in December, the fourth coldest on record, had slipped
0.3 percent and analysts attributed the subsequent improvement to
warm temperatures.
   ``Warm weather certainly is helping,'' said Steven Cochran, an
economist with WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``If it had been
cold, we wouldn't have seen these figures, I'm sure.''
   But David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National
Mortgage Association in Washington, said construction spending
began to lose its seasonal benefit in March.
   ``We expect it to start leveling off, if not decline, because it
will no longer have the seasonal boost and also because of
increasing interest rates,'' Berson said.
   Residential construction spending rose 1.7 percent in February
to a $198.5 billion annual rate after gaining 2.9 percent in
January.
   Single-family spending was up 3.9 percent to $123.0  to $21.0 billion
after a 5.5 percent decline in January.
   ``The weather effect was very strong in the single-family
market,'' said David Seiders, chief economist with the National
Association of Home Builders, ``but we expect (housing) starts to
tail off in the next few months.''
   ``Single-family construction has been on a brief rebound after
sliding throughout most of 1989,'' Seiders added. ``We do not
expect it to show a longer-term rebound over the year, though.
We're looking for it to fall back again.''
   Non-residential construction increased 5.5 percent to $106.4
billion after a 6.1 percent gain in January. Industrial, office and
other commercial building led the advance.
   ``A lot of the industrial construction was on the West Coast,''
Seiders said, ``not smokestack stuff, but high-tech facilities.
Office building is basically still on a downswing despite its
February gain.
   The government sector, which often is volatile, more than offset
its 2.0 percent January decline, rising 2.1 percent in February to
$493.8 billion. Schools and other public buildings and highways and
streets were the biggest gainers.
   The total construction spending figure was up 4.8 percent from
the level of building a year earlier.

<HEAD>Survey Says Manufacturing Decline Eases In March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. industrial sector remained weak in
March but declined at its slowest rate since June, a possible
indication that the overall economy may be poised for a pickup,
according to a survey of the nation's purchasing managers released
Monday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
economic trends by polling its members, said its overall index rose
to 48.8 percent in March from 48.3 percent the previous month.
   A reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing economy generally
is declining; above 50, that it generally is expanding.
   The March index represented the 11th consecutive monthly decline
but was at its highest level since June's 48.8 percent reading, due
to an increase in production and new export orders, the Tempe,
Ariz.-based trade group said in its report.
   With the exception of January, the purchasing managers' index
has risen gradually every month since November, leading some
economists to speculate the economy may have bottomed out.
   ``It's not so much the economy is getting strong but somewhat
steadier,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International. ``The report raises speculation
that the ... worst of the declining phase is behind us. The
question remains how strong and sustainable the statistical rebound
is.''
   Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing managers' business
survey committee, said the slight increase in the index ``may be
signaling a leveling-off in the 11-month decline in the economy.''
   ``The continued easing in the pace of the economic decline as we
exit the first quarter is encouraging,'' said Bretz, who also is
director of materials management at Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney
Bowes Inc.
   ``Although we may be forming a bottom, caution should be
exercised, since the first robin never makes it a spring.''
   Maury Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber Inc., said that
although manufacturing makes up a large portion of the nation's
gross national product, there are other areas that remain sluggish.
   ``The construction industry is getting ready to tumble,'' he
said.
   A report released Monday by the Commerce Department said
construction spending rose 2.6 percent in February, compared with a
revised 2.5 percent gain in January.
   Harris attributed the increase solely to unusually warm weather
across much of the nation and said the industry's overall
fundamentals were poor.
   The production portion of the purchasing managers' survey
increased for the second consecutive month during March. It rose to
an 11-month high of 54.4 percent from 51.5 percent in February.
   New orders grew slightly in March but at a slower pace than in
February, when they increased for the first time since mid-1989.
The new orders index stood at 50.4 percent, down from 51.8 percent.
   New export orders also rose, the group said. The seasonally
unadjusted new export orders index was 59.5 percent, up from 53.0
percent and the highest level since September 1989.
   Imports increased for the third consecutive month. The number of
members importing in March inched up to 78 percent from 77 percent,
the group said.
   But the employment portion of the survey declined for the 13th
consecutive month, with the index falling to 45.2 percent from 46.7
percent. Members continued to report layoffs, hiring freezes and
early retirement programs to reduce employment.
   Supplier deliveries were faster for the 11th consecutive month,
the group said. Most commodities were in supply, with the exception
of bearings, electric motors and some chemicals, it said.
   Meanwhile, prices of goods fell for the 10th consecutive month,
although the pace of decline was lower than in February.
   The purchasing managers' report is based on a monthly survey of
purchasing executives at over 300 industrial companies. Most of the
figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.

   Stock prices lapsed into a broad decline today
following the news of another big selloff in Japan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 19.82 to
2,687.39 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 335 up, 1,214 down
and 409 unchanged.
   The Tokyo stock market took a 6.6 percent drop overnight,
suffering the steepest decline yet in an early-1990 slide that has
sent prices to an 18-month low.
   In recent weeks the decline has had few ripple effects in U.S.
markets. Analysts have ascribed it to predominantly local forces in
Japan, including rising interest rates and lofty price-earnings
ratios.
   Some observers, in fact, have argued that a bad showing in Tokyo
might actually serve to prop up the American market by luring money
to Wall Street looking for a safe haven.
   But lately a good many analysts in this country have confessed
to worries that continued erosion in Tokyo might sooner or later
start to undermine confidence in other financial centers as well.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped &rsqb; to

<HEAD>Fleet Reports $200 Million Increase in Bad Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group said
Monday it expects its non-performing loans to increase by at least
$200 million in the first quarter, making it the latest bank to be
hit by New England's sagging economy.
   The company said its level of non-performing loans would reach
at least $600 million and could go higher as a result of an
examination now being conducted by federal regulators.
   ``We have not estimated what the reserve might be or what the
earnings might be,'' said Robert W. Lougee Jr., a Fleet spokesman.
   He said the company's first-quarter earnings report could be
delayed past the April 18 annual meeting, depending on the outcome
of the examination.
   Fleet also said it would sell about half of its credit card
portfolio of about $500 million to Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis.
The sale and a change in investments for the corporation's pension
plan is expected to produce a one-time gain of $90 million before
taxes for the first quarter, Fleet said.
   A $600 million level of non-performing loans would amount to
about 2.6 percent of Fleet's loan and lease portfolio of about
$22.5 billion. That still is lower than the industry average of
about 3 percent, Lougee said.
   The bad loans had been identified ``largely on our own'' and not
at the insistence of federal regulators, Lougee said, although
``we're clearly aware the regulators are here.''
   Fleet has been praised for its diversification, with almost
two-thirds of its assets outside of New England, and for steering
clear of much of the overbuilt condominium market, which rapidly
collapsed during the past year.
   But, ``other segments of commercial real estate have clearly
been affected,'' Lougee said, including office parks and small
shopping centers.
   The bad loans ``are spread out in the commercial real estate
portfolio,'' he said.
   According to Fleet's first-quarter filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, about $8.4 billion of its loan portfolio
is in commercial and industrial loans and loans to other financial
institutions.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge Following Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late selloff rooted in a
government crop report and spurred on by bearish technical market
factors.
   Corn and oat futures finished moderately higher while wheat
futures closed mixed.
   Friday's annual Agriculture Department report on spring planting
intentions indicated U.S. farmers plan to increase corn acreage by
about 3.5 percent this year while decreasing soybean acreage by 2
percent and spring wheat acreage by 4 percent from last year's
levels.
   The market had expected the report to project a larger increase
in corn plantings, a bigger drop in soybean acreage and a smaller
decline in spring wheat seedings.
   Session-long weakness in the soybean market stemmed from the
report and from signs of an increase in Brazilian soybean
harvesting and exports, said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   But she said the market crumbled late in the session when ``we
broke some (technical) chart points and that started the
technically inspired selling.''
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 4
cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.55} a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with May at $2.63} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $1.51\ a
bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 12{ cents lower with May at $5.86
a bushel.

<HEAD>Junk Bonds Cause $836 Million Quarterly Loss at First Executive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Executive Corp. said Monday that the
plummeting value of its junk-bond portfolio had caused an $836
million loss in its final quarter and a $776 million loss for the
year.
   The insurance holding company, whose subsidiaries include
Executive Life Insurance Co. of Los Angeles, announced in January
that it anticipated an after-tax charge of $515 million to 1989
earnings due to junk bond losses. It said Monday they were so bad
it had added another $344 million.
   The huge writeoffs caused revenue to plunge 44 percent for the
year and left third-quarter revenue more than a half-billion
dollars in the red.
   Los Angeles-based First Executive became the second Southern
California institution in as many days to be buried beneath an
avalanche of losses from uninsured junk bonds, which pay high rates
because they fund risky ventures.
   On Sunday, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association reported losses
of $575 million in a five-month period due to junk bonds, rendering
it insolvent and in danger of seizure by federal regulators.
   Both First Executive and Columbia were closely allied with
Michael Milken, the financier who pioneered the use of junk bonds
in the 1980s while working for brokerage Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   First Executive invested about $6.5 billion in junk bonds. It
said that as of Dec. 31, when its fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended, the value of that portfolio had fallen to about $1.4 billion
below face value.
   For the fourth quarter, First Executive's $836 million loss, the
equivalent of $9.98 a share, compared with a profit of $48 million,
or 42 cents a share, in 1988. Revenue plunged far into red ink:
from $552 million in 1988 to a negative $541 million in 1989.
   For the year, First Executive's $776 million loss was the
equivalent of $9.67 a share and came on revenue of $1.19 billion.
That compared with a profit of $175 million, $1.51 a share, on
revenue of $2.14 billion in 1988.
   First Executive said its assets at the end of the year were
about $19.2 billion and shareholders' equity more than $1 billion.
Life insurance in force was about $59.7 billion compared with $57.3
billion last year.
   The company strove to reassure policyholders with its various
subsidiaries.
   ``Executive Life Insurance Co. ... Executive Life Insurance Co.
of New York, and other insurance subsidiaries are all strongly
capitalized and generating strong statutory earnings,'' said Alan
Snyder, the president.

   Energy futures prices rose Monday amid strong
buying of oil products.
   Market analysts said activity was light to moderate on the New
York Mercantile Exchange with much of the buying interest focused
on contracts for delivery later than May, the near-month contract.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline finished up
0.72 cent at 66.08 cents a gallon after adding 0.25 cent on Friday.
The April contract expired Friday at 59.93 cents a gallon, up 2.26
cents.
   The June, July and August unleaded gas contracts posted gains
ranging from 0.80 cent to 1.01 cents.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, wholesale home heating oil for May delivery rose 0.93 to
55.27 cents a gallon following Friday's increase of 0.56 cent. The
expired April contract had ended with a gain of 0.85 cent at 57.02
cents a gallon on Friday.
   No. 2 heating oil contracts for June, July and August delivery
rose by 1.32 cents to 1.38 cents.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, advanced 20 cents to $20.48 per
42-gallon barrel, adding to Friday's gain of 25 cents. Later
contract months rose by similar to slightly larger amounts.
   Richard Redoglia, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said there weren't any new fundamental developments to
account for the buying.
   He said there was still speculation in the market that future
reports will show substantial drawdowns in gasoline stocks,
indicated rising demand.

   The dollar ended mostly higher Monday against
other major foreign currencies despite a wave of profit-taking.
   Gold prices declined here and abroad. On the Commodity Exchange
in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.80 a
troy ounce, off 40 cents from late Friday. Republic National Bank
in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $370.25 an ounce,
unchanged.
   The dollar started out sharply higher on weakness in the
Japanese yen, the British pound and the West German mark, dealers
said. But they said traders hoping to cash in on its recent rise
pushed the dollar off its highs.
   ``Maybe the dollar has gone up too far, too fast,'' said Robert
Ryan, a senior trader for Bank of New York.
   Another dealer from Europe said, ``There are some people that
think the move (against the yen) was overdone. Now, there's talk
the Group of Seven will get a rescue package together this weekend
for the yen.''
   The finance ministers of the United States, West Germany, Japan,
France, Britain, Italy, and Canada are scheduled to meet in Paris
on April 7.
   A 6.8 percent fall on the Tokyo stock market earlier Monday put
the yen under renewed pressure.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 2.30 yen to a closing 159.95 yen. It was quoted at
159.18 yen in London, and at 158.65 yen in New York, up from 158.35
yen Friday.
   Earl I. Johnson, a trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago,
said the dollar flirted with the 160-yen level in the United States
before falling back. The last time the dollar traded at around that
level was in December 1986, he said.
   Meanwhile, sterling was hurt by concern about recent violent
riots in London over Britain's new poll tax. In London, the British
pound fell to $1.6300 from $1.6465 late Friday. In New York,
sterling fell to $1.6390 from $1.6455.
   The dollar also rose against the West German mark following
reports that the East German central bank won't accept an exchange
rate of one West German mark for two East German marks as part of a
reunification plan.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes Friday,
included: 1.6985 West German marks, up from 1.6940; 1.5010 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4982; 5.7105 French francs, up from 5.7020;
1,249.25 Italian lire, up from 1,248.75; and 1.16785 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.16945.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with rates late
Friday were: 1.7052 West German marks, up from 1.6875; 1.5068 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4935; 5.7300 French francs, up from 5.6765;
1.9193 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9008; 1,254.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,243.25; and 1.1690 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1700.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $368.95 an ounce,
down from $369.25 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold was unchanged at
$368.75 an ounce.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 2 cents to close at a bid of
$371.16 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.946 a troy ounce, up from $4.945
late Friday. Silver fell in London to $4.96 an ounce from $4.97.

   The stock market posted a broad loss in light
trading Monday following the news of another big selloff in Japan.
   Most of the drop in New York came in the early moments of the

   The Tokyo stock market took a 6.6 percent drop overnight,
suffering the steepest decline yet in an early-1990 slide that has
sent prices to an 18-month low.
   In recent weeks the decline has had few ripple effects in U.S.
markets. Analysts have ascribed it to predominantly local forces in
Japan, including rising interest rates and lofty price-earnings
ratios.
   Some observers, in fact, have argued that a bad showing in Tokyo
might actually serve to prop up the American market by luring money
to Wall Street looking for a safe haven.
   But lately a good many analysts in this country have confessed
to worries that continued erosion in Tokyo might sooner or later
undermine confidence in other financial centers as well.

<BYLINE>Pork Futures Soar On Supply Outlook
^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most pork futures prices rose their permitted daily limits
Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange following a government
report that indicated 1990 hog production will continue to lag
behind last year's.
   On other commodity markets, cattle futures advanced; soybean
futures fell sharply while grains were mixed; oil futures gained;
and precious metals retreated slightly.
   Live hog futures settled .87 cent to the limit 1.5 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in April up .87 cent at 54.27 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.98 cents to the limit 2 cents
higher with May at 55.57 cents a pound.
   In cattle trading, live cattle were .38 cent to .73 cent higher
with April at 78.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to
.48 cent higher with April at 82.62 cents a pound.
   Analysts said the strong rally in pork futures was rooted in the
Agriculture Department's hogs-and-pigs inventory, a quarterly tally
of the nation's hog herd.
   Released Friday after trading ended, the report said the hog
herd as of March 1 was 4 percent smaller than on the same date a
year earlier. The market had expected a decline of closer to 2.6
percent.
   The government's estimate of the number of animals kept by
producers for breeding purposes during the December-February
quarter was also below market expectations.
   The report suggested pork producers remain cautious about
expanding their herds despite higher hog prices, and that the 1990
U.S. hog herd will remain smaller than last year's all year long.
   ``Whether you choose to believe that or not is another question
but that's what the report said,'' said Chuck Levitt, senior
livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The heaviest buying of pork futures occurred in contracts for
delivery next fall and winter. Buying interest spread to the
near-month contracts as the back-month contracts reached their
daily limits.
   Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., said the
market might stage a partial retreat after the sudden runup. But he
said the bullish attitudes that have driven hog prices steadily
higher since early February remain in place.
   ``There's a large group of people out there who think we're
going to see $60 (per hundredweight) hogs this summer and maybe
this report gave them the confidence to push their positions,'' he
said.
   Soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade in a
late selloff rooted in a government crop report and spurred on by
bearish technical market factors. Grain futures ended mixed.
   Friday's annual Agriculture Department report on spring planting
intentions indicated U.S. farmers plan to increase corn acreage by
about 3.5 percent this year while decreasing soybean acreage by 2
percent and spring wheat acreage by 4 percent from last year's
levels.
   The market had expected the report to project a larger increase
in corn plantings, a bigger drop in soybean acreage and a smaller
decline in spring wheat seedings.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 4 cents higher with May
at $3.55} a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 4 cents higher with May at
$2.63{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with May at
$1.51\ a bushel; soybeans were 9{ cents to 12 cents lower with May
at $5.85 a bushel.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid strong buying on expectations that Tuesday's weekly American
Petroleum Institute inventory report will show substantial
drawdowns in gasoline stocks, indicating rising demand.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 30 cents
higher with May at $20.48 a barrel; heating oil was .93 cent to
1.38 cent higher with May at 55.27 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .70 cent to 1.01 cents higher with May at 66.08 cents
a gallon.
   Gold futures edged lower while silver futures were barely
changed on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold futures settled 40 cents to 70 cents lower with April at
$369.80 a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent lower to 0.6 cent higher
with April at $4.946 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Dreyer's Introduces Cholesterol-Free, Low-Fat Frozen Dessert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. said Monday it has
developed a cholesterol-free frozen dessert that it touts as tasing
like premium ice cream but having only a fraction of the fat and
one-third fewer calories.
   The product, called American Dream, contains less than 1 percent
fat and 80 calories per three-ounce serving, the Oakland,
Calif.-based food company said.
   That compares with 16 percent fat, 30 milligrams of cholesterol
and 120 calories in three ounces of typical premium ice cream, the
company said.
   Dreyer's said it was able to reduce the fat and eliminate
cholesterol in American Dream through a proprietary technology that
concentrates protein and ``enables us to use all the same dairy
ingredients found in ice cream.''
   That distinguishes it from Monsanto Co.'s Simple Pleasures, a
recently introduced, frozen dessert that uses the fat substitute
Simplesse, which is made from egg whites and milk protein.
   T. Gary Rogers, chairman and chief executive of Dreyer's, said
in a telephone interview that American Dream should attract people
who have been avoiding ice cream because of its fat and cholesterol
content.
   He said it will also enable ice cream eaters to consume more of
this type of dessert without worrying about cholesterol, which is
believed to contribute to heart and arterial diseases.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Dreyer's rose 25 cents a
share to $32.75.
   Rogers said Dreyer's has used its protein concentration process
for its light frozen dessert and yogurt products. He said that
although the process is not patented, others have been unable to
duplicate it.
   Joseph Arsenio, an analyst who follows Dreyer's for the
investment firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco, said his firm
was enthusiastic about the new product.
   ``It should appeal to an audience that is very cholesterol as
well as fat conscious,'' he said.
   The company plans to sell the dessert in nine flavors and make
it available in quarts and half gallons rather than the pint sizes
used for superpremium ice creams. It will be priced comparably with
premium ice cream, or about $2.30 for a quart and $4 for a
half-gallon, the company said.
   American Dream should reach stores within six to eight weeks,
Rogers said.
   Dreyer's said it is the nation's third-largest ice cream and
frozen dessert maker with sales of $227 million in 1989.
Industrywide sales amounted to $9.3 billion last year, according to
the International Ice Cream Association trade group.
   Dreyer's makes and distributes its premium ice cream under the
name Dreyer's Grand in the West and Edy's Grand east of the
Rockies. It also makes Grand Light, a frozen dessert with 7 percent
fat, and Frozen Yogurt Inspirations, with 3 pecent fat.
   Rogers said Dreyer's will spend $24 million marketing all of its
products this year, up from $18 million in 1989.

<HEAD>Torchmark Withdraws $6.4 Billion Bid For American General</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Farley-Pepperell, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torchmark Corp. withdrew a $6.4 billion bid for
American General Corp. Monday, a week after proposing the buyout,
choosing instead to work to elect its own nominees to American
General's board of directors.
   The Birmingham, Ala.-based insurance and financial services
company said it decided to withdraw the offer for the much larger
American General because it never received a response to its
proposal.
   Torchmark had sent a letter informing American General of the
offer last March 26, saying the Houston-based insurance and
financial services company had two days to give an answer.
   ``Since no response was forthcoming, the proposal was
withdrawn,'' Torchmark said Monday, adding that American General
had refused to meet to discuss the bid.
   American General has only said it was reviewing the bid and that
directors would discuss it at their next regular meeting May 2, the
day of the company's annual shareholders meeting.
   Torchmark had proposed to buy about half of American General's
126.7 million outstanding shares of common stock for $50 a share,
and to exchange $50 worth of Torchmark common stock for each of the
remaining shares. The company had said the offer was negotiable.
   But Torchmark also said it would propose a slate of five
independent nominees for the American General board at the May 2
meeting. Three board members are up for re-election and three seats
are up for election.
   ``Independent nominees, when elected, will be committed to
independently assessing whether or not a business combination of
American General would be in the shareholders' best interest,''
Torchmark said in a statement Monday.
   American General issued a statement saying it has rejected
Torchmark's attempt to propose its own slate of directors because
it was past the company's March 3 deadline for nominations.
   American General has filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a
judge to uphold its bylaws and prohibit Torchmark from soliciting
proxies in an effort to elect its own slate of directors. A hearing
date on the lawsuit has not been set.
   Torchmark also said it would propose a resolution at the meeting
calling on the board to appoint a committee of independent
directors to evaluate all acquisition proposals and to hire an
investment banking firm to solicit offers.
   ``We made a generous proposal to consolidate with American
General at a 59 percent premium over market price for American
General shareholders,'' Torchmark President John T. Rotenstreich
said Monday.
   ``American General said that its board would not consider our
proposal until after its annual meeting on May 2, so the annual
meeting has become a referendum on whether shareholders want the
board to seriously consider proposals like ours,'' he said.
   He said Torchmark intends to make another proposal only if
shareholders express support for a merger by electing the
independent nominees or voting in favor of the resolution.
   At the end of 1989, American General's total assets were $32.1
billion and common shareholders' equity was $4.1 billion. Torchmark
reported total assets as of Dec. 31 of $4.9 billion and common
shareholders' equity of $795 million.

<HEAD>Takes Out Ad to Sell What's Left of Corp. Finance, Junk Bond
Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk-bond giant that
crumpled under its own debt, is peddling the remnants of what once
were the company's crown jewels with a garage sale that includes
client lists and computer gear.
   ``For Sale,'' reads the top of the two-column advertisements for
publication Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal. ``Data, software,
and files from our Corporate Finance and High Yield Bond
Departments.''
   The partial listing includes names, addresses and titles of
clients and prospective clients covering approximately 4,000
companies. Also offered are databases on all of Drexel's public
offerings since 1970 and about 3,800 publicly disclosed merger
transactions since 1983.
   In addition, the ad states, Drexel is selling a complete ``High
Yield Bond System,'' described as a package of computer hardware
and software designed to ``provide timely, accurate, comprehensive
information on high-yield securities.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said prices of the items would
be negotiated and the firm already has received what he called
``indications of interest.'' He didn't identify prospective buyers.
   ``This is just part of our orderly disposal,'' he said.
``There's no timing involved. The sooner the better.''
   Once one of Wall Street's most powerful and profitable firms,
Drexel sought bankruptcy protection Feb. 13 after it defaulted on
its short-term debt and failed to get more financing.
   Part of Drexel's demise stemmed from a steep decline in the $200
billion market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, which it
pioneered and dominated through the 1980s.
   Its problems were aggravated by a loss of confidence among
lenders and the resultant effects of the firm's record guilty plea
to securities fraud, which brought in fines and restitution
totaling about $650 million.
   Under an agreement between the company and creditors, three
Drexel board members are supervising the firm's liquidation with
input from creditors.

<HEAD>Railroad Company Reports First-Quarter Earnings Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Corp. on Monday reported its
first-quarter earnings slipped marginally, as a one-time gain from
the sale of its natural gas processing operation was offset by
increased expenses and a restructuring program.
   The railroad and natural resources company reported a profit of
$77 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with earnings of $82
million, or 74 cents a share, during the same period last year.
   During the quarter, CSX sold its CSX Energy Corp. to Enron
Corp., resulting in an after-tax gain of $52 million. The gain was
partially offset by a $33 million after-tax expense from the
restructuring of Sea-Land Service Inc., CSX's container-shipping
subsidiary.
   According to CSX, rail operating income declined to $155 million
from $158 million a year ago despite increased revenue, which rose
$23 million to $1.3 billion from the first three months of 1989.
   Strong coal, grain and fertilizer traffic more than offset
weaknesses in the automotive and metals sectors, which dropped 24
percent and 7 percent respectively, CSX said.
   But rising diesel fuel prices helped boost rail expenses by $26
million to $1.1 billon. Also contributing to the higher rail
expenses were an expanded locomotive repair program and costs
associated with flooding in the South.

<HEAD>Pilots Union Approves Temporary Agreement with Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Eastern Airlines pilots union voted heavily in
favor of a temporary contract that makes steep concessions, the
union said Monday.
   ``It was an overwhelming approval,'' said Dan Ashby, a spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association. He said final figures hadn't
been tallied for the secret weekend balloting at union offices in
six cities.
   The six-month agreement, retroactive to March 1, gives working
union pilots 25 percent pay cuts, increased health insurance
contributions, continuation of increased work hours imposed because
of the unions' strike, and reduces Eastern's contributions to the
employees' retirement funds.
   The concessions were part of Eastern's plan for emerging from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline faces mounting
skepticism from unsecured creditors, who last week discussed
calling for liquidation after Eastern said it couldn't repay them
50 cents on the dollar as agreed earlier.
   ``Once again, the Eastern pilots are offering to help,'' Ashby
said. ``This vote by no means says there is labor peace on the
property. We are very concerned about the future.''
   The two sides are in federally mediated talks on a permanent
agreement.
   The pilots say they're willing to make concessions, but Eastern
management must commit to hire more pilots back and to making
Miami-based Eastern viable.
   ``This (concessionary agreement) will not save Eastern Airlines.
It's just a drop in the bucket,'' Ashby said.
   Eastern has some 1,800 pilots, more than half hired after the
pilots union walked out March 4, 1989, in sympathy with the
striking Machinists union. The Machinists remain on strike, while
the pilots and flight attendants called their strikes off last
November.
   Eastern has been slow to return strikers to work, saying it has
no openings.
   The newly hired pilots, whose jobs are under court challenge
from the pilots union, won't have their salaries cut under the
temporary agreement.
   The union would like Eastern to hire back 1,500 more union
pilots.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline hadn't been
informed by the union of its vote.
   ``We still have a long way to go on reaching a permanent
agreement,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ``Right now, there are no more
talks scheduled and we're waiting to hear from the National
Mediation Board.''
   Separately Monday, Eastern and Delta Air Lines said they settled
claims relating to normal business and ticketing transactions prior
to Eastern's bankruptcy filing on March 9, 1989. Eastern agreed to
pay $16.8 million in cash, plus interest, to Atlanta-based Delta.
   As a result, Eastern and Delta will renew their cooperative
ticketing and baggage agreement.

<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. on Monday reported a combined operating loss of $45.7
million in February and said that was an improvement over results
for late January, after they filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``We view February results as reflecting the stabilization of
our department store operations in the post-filing period,''
spokeswoman Carol Sanger said in a statement.
   The Cincinnati-based companies filed for Chapter 11 protection
from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 15.
   Federated lost $29.8 million in February and Allied lost $15.8
million. The sister companies, owned by Toronto-based Campeau
Corp., together operate 260 stores and employ 100,000 people in 28
states.
   The latest results showed increased sales of apparel, shoes,
fashion and home accessories, the companies said. Sales of
electronic goods and furniture lagged, however, partly because of
some inventory shortfalls and resulting delays of promotions, they
said.
   End-of-month inventories were similar to those of a year
earlier, the companies said. Vendors' supplies of merchandise to
Federated and Allied have nearly returned to normal levels, the
companies said.
   The results were made available to U.S. Trustee Conrad J.
Morgenstern, whose office is assisting U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J.
Vincent Aug Jr. in overseeing the companies' operations during
bankruptcy reorganization.
   The companies on Jan. 15 listed debts totaling $7.7 billion,
mainly acquired in Campeau's purchases of Allied in 1986 and
Federated in 1988.

<TEXT>
   The Manville Property Damage Settlement Trust has
completed a review of 14,000 claims for asbestos exposure and has
paid $68 million to some of the claimants, the trust announced
Monday.
   The trust, based in White Plains, N.Y., said in a news statement
it also has set aside $28 million for settling other claims, and
expects an additional $200 million to be available for distribution
over the next three years.
   The trust was established in 1988 as part of a reorganization of
Denver-bsaed Manville Corp. by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the
Southern District of New York.
   More than 3,000 claimants have submitted claims so far, and the
largest 50 will receive over 25 percent of the money. The largest
200 claimants will receive over 45 percent, according to the trust.
   Of the $1.3 billion claimed, no more than $280 million or 21
percent can be reimbursed.
   The fund was established to resolve millions of dollars in
damage claims against Manville stemming from its days as the
nation's largest asbestos producer.
   The company was forced to file for protection from creditors in
1982 as a result of asbestos-related lawsuits. It emerged from that
protection in 1988.
   Among the largest claimants, seeking more than $2 million, are
the city of New York, United States Steel Corp., the state of
Massachusetts, the state of Illinois, the state of New York, and
the state of Texas.
   Kurt H. Schaffir, the trust's executive director, said the trust
is limited on how much of the final settlement on any claim can be
paid, and how much of this can be distributed at any point in time.
   Reimbursements are limited to fixed percentages for different
categories, but trust officials say people should still continue to
file if they think they have a claim.
   ``The rate at which claims are being received has tapered off
considerably, and it is quite possible that sufficient funds will
be available over the next three years to pay half or more of the
maximum payable amounts. We believe that it continues to be very
much worthwhile for eligible claimants to file new claims,''
Schaffir said.
   Manville, founded in 1858, makes building products and packaging
materials.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole predicted
Monday that T. Timothy Ryan Jr. will be approved by the Senate
despite Ryan's acknowledgement that he used marijuana and cocaine
in the 1970s.
   ``In my view, the nominee will be confirmed,'' the Kansas
senator said as Republicans pushed for a quick Senate floor vote.
``The question will be on whether he has the experience.''
   Dole asked for a vote this week on the nomination of Ryan, a
former solicitor in the Labor Department who is President Bush's
choice to head the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift
Supervision.
   Dole and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady huddled over the
weekend on how to minimize the damage from the disclosure Friday
that Ryan had acknowledged to the FBI and Bush administration
officials that in the 1970s he had used marijuana occasionally and
had tried cocaine ``once, perhaps twice.''
   Ryan, 44, survived a 11-10 confirmation vote in the Senate
Banking Committee Thursday. That vote came after he acknowledged
during hearings that he has little experience with banking or
thrifts.
   On Monday night, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., rose on the floor of
the Senate to defend Ryan, saying he had known the lawyer for
several years and had confidence in Ryan's integrity.
   ``I don't think there's any question of the man's honesty or of
his effectiveness,'' Warner said, noting that Ryan brought the past
drug use to the attention of investigators conducting a background
check on him.
   ``Mr. Ryan, when approached by the president's staff, disclosed
certain facts, which now have been brought out in the press,''
Warner said. He said the nominee ``was up front, and in an honest
way he gave all that information to the FBI.''
   Warner said Ryan made a mistake in trying drugs, but his error
should be placed in the context of the Vietnam War generation.
   ``No matter how serious the mistake was, it seems to me that
that generation was subjected to a most unusual period of
history,'' Warner said. Each person should be judged individually,
Warner said, adding that Ryan was never tempted to use drugs after
``that limited experience.''
   Warner said members of the Banking Committee had access to the
FBI background report, including the detailing of past drug use by
Ryan's own admission, and still voted to favorably recommend his
confirmation.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
had said last Friday, ``Mr. Ryan clearly lacks the necessary
professional qualifications for what is the single most complex and
important financial job in our country today. Hundreds of billions
of dollars are at stake.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, would not
venture an opinion Monday on ``how the substance abuse issue will
affect the vote.'' The vote on the nomination could come as early
as Wednesday, he said.
   ``That's a matter for each senator,'' Mitchell said. ``I think
there is widespread concern about the thoroughness of his
qualifications for such an important job.''
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill. and chairman of the House Banking
Committee's financial institutions subcommittee, questioned how
Bush could nominate an acknowledged former drug user.
   ``The man admitted he was on cocaine; he admitted he was on
marijuana,'' Annunzio said. ``What's that say to children you're
telling to `just say no'? He sure puts a crimp on the war on
drugs.''
   The 21-member Senate Banking Committee had access to the FBI
files but Ryan's drug use was not raised during his confirmation
hearings.
   After the disclosure by NBC News Friday night, Riegle condemned
the release of the FBI material as improper and Brady said Ryan's
drug ``incidents were limited and a long time ago.''
   The White House also defended Ryan, with spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater saying, ``We knew about it beforehand; we felt it was not
relevant.''

<HEAD>Institutional Selloff Speculation Triggers Second-Worst Tokyo Drop</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf with index down 77 points for morning session.</NOTE>

   The shell-shocked Tokyo Stock Exchange was hammered
again Monday as speculation that major institutional investors were
getting ready to dump stocks triggered the market's second-worst
decline ever.
   The yen also tumbled against the dollar, worsening the stock
market selloff in a violent twin reaction to an unconfirmed news
report that major life insurers planned to shift funds out of the
stock market.
   The bellwether Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues dropped
1,978.38 points, or 6.59 percent, to 28,002.07. The plunge was
second only to the Oct. 20, 1987, drop that followed Wall Street's
``Black Monday'' crash and saw the Nikkei fall 3,836.48 points, or
14.9 percent.
   The index rebounded more than 400 points early Tuesday morning
but quickly resumed its slump and finished the morning session down
77.19 points, or 0.28 percent, at 27,924.88.
   The influential financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported
Monday that major insurance firms, including Dai-ichi Mutual Life
Insurance Co., Nippon Life Insurance Co., and Sumitomo Mutual Life
Insurance Co., planned to sell large blocks of shares. The
newspaper said the sales were required because the ratio of the
insurors' stock holdings to total assets was approaching government
regulatory limits.
   Dai-Ichi told a mid-day news conference that it would continue
to buy stocks during its current fiscal year, but the report
already had shaken the markets.
   ``The big life insurers are the market's most conservative,
long-term and richest investors. The report saying massive selling
was likely scared off potential buyers,'' said Christopher
Leighton, manager of international sales at Schroder Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
   Although Finance Ministry officials and Dai-Ichi denied the
report, it reaffirmed market expectations of a general shift by
major investors out of the stock market, said Jason James,
strategist at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
   The initial price declines snowballed amid rapid brokerage
selling for individuals who needed cash to meet margin calls and on
profit-taking by investors high-priced electrical company shares,
traders said.
   Also weakening the stock market was the continued decline of the
yen, which is seen as worsening inflation prospects and chasing
Japanese investment funds to ovrseas markets.
   The dollar finished at 159.95 yen in Tokyo, up 2.30 yen from
Friday's close, and at one point traded above 160 yen for the first
time since December. 1986. Later in London, the dollar traded at
159.18 yen and in New York the dollar was quoted at 158.65 yen in
late trading.
   The dollar opened Tuesday morning in Tokyo at 159.10 yen.
   Overseas markets also were rattled by Tokyo's decline, which
followed a 3.37 percent drop in the Nikkei average during Friday's
session.
   Stocks fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange, where investors
also were concerned about political turmoil related to a new tax.
However, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
rebounded from its lows to finish 26.3 points lower at 2,221.6.
   On Wall Street, stocks declined broadly but finished above their
lows. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 20
points at one time, finished off 6.76 at 2,700.45. In the broader
market, about five stocks fell for every two that rose on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Market-watchers predicted further weakness in coming days for
the Tokyo stock market, partly because of expectations that the yen
would weaken further.
   Dealers predicted currency trading would be volatile ahead of
the April 7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the
Group of SEven industrial nations.
   Concern over the outcome of U.S.-Japan trade talks in Washington
also could push the dollar higher, analysts said.
   Officials of both countries are expected within the next two
weeks to issue an interim report on the talks, which are aimed at
solving the $49 billion trade imbalance between the two nations.

<HEAD>General Development Skips Tax Payments; Considering Bankruptcy
Filing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf with 3 grafs to UPDATE with comment.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cash-strapped General Development Corp. has skipped
more than $10 million in property tax payments and is considering
filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said Monday.
   Property tax payments on the nine Florida communities built by
the indicted developer had to be postmarked by Sunday, but none
were sent, said company spokesman Otis Wragg.
   ``There are some other payments that are due,'' he said. ``There
are of course some grace periods that are involved, but I can't
give you a list of them.''
   The Miami-based developer pleaded guilty last month in federal
court to mail-fraud conspiracy for overpricing homes by the
thousands and deceiving the buyers about their true values.
   General Development has been seeking $60 million in interim
credit for three weeks, but talks broke off last weekend without
agreement, leading to the announcement that a bankruptcy filing was
being considered.
   ``We felt obliged to make known to the public that this was one
of the options that we are considering,'' Wragg said. ``However, we
have not made a decision to file for protection, and I cannot
speculate as to whether that might be a decision.''
   General Development told the Securities and Exchange Commmission
earlier that it would cost about $400 million to finish developing
its land, but only $102.1 million has been budgeted for
improvements.
   Failure to pay property taxes triggers a two-year legal process
that could end with the sale of the land, but General Development
could avoid that by paying the taxes, interest and penalties at any
time up to the day of sale.
   ``I don't foresee them losing any property unless they go
kerflooey and close up,'' said Gene Morris, the tax collector for
Indian River County.
   General Development owes $709,672 in property taxes, or 0.8
percent of the county tax roll, on about 2,800 vacant parcels and
sewer and water plants, he said.
   In Brevard County where General Development owns 18,000 empty
lots, Tax Collector C.N. ``Newt'' Jones was more worried about the
paperwork nightmare that a tax sale might cause. The county
normally lists about 11,000 items for its annual tax sale.
   The company owes more than $2 million in property taxes, or
about 1 percent of Brevard's annual collections, Jones said.
   United Capital Corp., a minority shareholder, offered short-term
operating funds and a restructuring plan involving the sales of
assets last week.
   But the New York-based real estate company, which plans to
submit a slate of new GDC board nominees that include United
Capital's chairman, announced Monday that talks had broken down.
   The talks ended after United Capital rejected a proposal that
would have involved immediately dropping its plan to nominate new
directors before negotiations on a possible financial transaction
would begin, United Capital said in a statement.
   ``General Development's board seems more intent on keeping
control even if they had to take General Develoment into
bankruptcy,'' A.F. Petrocelli, chairman of United Capital, said in
a statement.
