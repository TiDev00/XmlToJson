   Here is a chronology of major events in the Nancy Cruzan
right-to-die case:
   - Jan. 11, 1983: Nancy Cruzan, then 25, has a wreck on a country
road southeast of Carthage, in the Ozarks of southwest Missouri and
is thrown from the car. Paramedics restart her breathing, but her
brain was without oxygen for so long she never regains
consciousness.
   - Feb. 5, 1983: Doctors implant a feeding tube in Ms. Cruzan's
stomach. She isn't on any life support system, such as a
respirator.
   - Oct. 19, 1983: Ms. Cruzan is moved to the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon.
   - Oct. 23, 1987: Joe and Joyce Cruzan ask Jasper County Probate
Judge Charles Teel for permission to remove their daughter's
feeding tube so she can die as they believe she would want.
   - March 9, 1988: A three-day hearing begins on the family's
request. The Cruzans say their daughter has a common-law right to
be free from unwanted medical treatment, and state and federal
constitutional rights to privacy that protect her right to refuse
unwanted medical treatment.
   - July 27, 1988: Teel approves the request.
   - Aug. 3, 1988: Missouri Attorney General William Webster files
notice that the state will appeal to the state Supreme Court.
   - Nov. 16, 1988: The state Supreme Court votes 4-3 to overturn
the lower court. The family appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   - Dec. 6, 1989: The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments, the
first time it has considered a right-to-die case.
   - June 25, 1990: In a 5-4 decision, the court blocks removal of
the tube. It says the state could keep a patient on life support in
the absence of ``clear and convincing'' evidence the person would
want to die.
   - Aug. 30, 1990: Ms. Cruzan's parents ask Teel for a second
hearing, saying they have new evidence their daughter once
indicated to three people she would rather die than live in a
vegetative state.
   - Sept. 17, 1990: Webster says the state no longer has a
``recognizable legal interest'' in the case, and asks the judge to
drop the state Health Department and the director of the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center from future litigation.
   - Oct. 23, 1990: Teel drops the state as a defendant.
   - Nov. 1, 1990: Three former co-workers tell Teel they recalled
conversations with Ms. Cruzan in which she said she never would
want to live ``like a vegetable'' on medical machines. Ms. Cruzan's
physician, who previously opposed removing the feeding tube, terms
her life ``a living hell'' and testifies she should be allowed to
die.
   - Dec. 5, 1990: Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed guardian recommends
the tube be removed.
   - Dec. 14, 1990: Teel approves.
   - Dec. 18-24, 1990: State and federal courts reject injunction
requests by anti-euthanasia groups.
   - Dec. 26, 1990: Ms. Cruzan dies in the Missouri Rehabilitation
Center.

<HEAD>GOP Veteran Bill Frenzel Leaving Congress, `Weary of 90-Hour
Weeks'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Frenzel is retiring after 20 years
in Congress, a move that mystifies many other lawmakers. He
explains it simply: ``I have grown weary of 90-hour weeks.''
   The 62-year-old Minnesota Republican is leaving Capitol Hill at
the peak of what both Republicans and Democrats call a productive
House career.
   ``He's highly respected by members on both sides of the aisle,''
Rep. Martin Sabo, D-Minn., said.
   As top Republican on the House Budget Committee and one of the
most outspoken fiscal conservatives on the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee, Frenzel commanded national attention in the
business community.
   He also gained a reputation as one of Capitol Hill's resident
curmudgeons, sometimes seasoning his observations with gentle
sarcasm.
   Rep. Willis Gradison, R-Ohio, recalled that Frenzel once
described himself as ``a kind of doormat to be walked over by
ambitious majority members.''
   ``I don't think that's true,'' Gradison added.
   A fiscal conservative but pro-choice on abortion, Frenzel was
virtually assured of winning reelection for as long as he liked in
his Third District, taking in the prosperous southern and western
suburbs of Minneapolis.
   But the job proved exasperating at times, Frenzel said in an
interview. Part of it was the grind of early morning breakfasts,
all-day meetings and late night sessions on the House floor. He
said with only a touch of exaggeration that added up to ``90-hour
weeks.''
   And these marathon rounds were compounded by agonizing deadlock
over how to cut the ballooning federal deficit.
   ``The budget was an acute frustration,'' Frenzel said. ``I can't
express how horrible it was over the last six months.''
   He tried repeatedly without success to impose across-the-board
cuts on spending bills.
   In October, Frenzel put his personal popularity on the line to
plead with House members to support a deficit-reduction package of
$500 billion over five years reached after months of negotiations
between congressional leaders and the Bush administration.
   The lawmakers gave him a standing ovation but voted against him.
   Frenzel's favorite targets over the years have included a
burgeoning federal bureaucracy, protectionism in foreign trade,
congressional perquisites and a campaign finance system he deemed
out of control.
   He played a major role in writing campaign finance reform
legislation following the Watergate scandals and was dubbed ``the
father of the Federal Election Commission.''
   The legislation put size limits on political contributions and
required campaigns to report them to the commission. Its files, in
turn, provide the public with a listing of who gives money to the
candidates, how much and how the funds are spent. The measure is
credited with ending the era in which wealthy ``fat cats''
bankrolled congressional office-seekers.
   Frenzel later became an expert in tax policy. He fought
successfully in 1978 and 1981 for cuts in the capital gains tax he
believed would stimulate economic growth.
   In 1990, after years of trying, he got the House to impose
limits on free congressional mail, what Frenzel called the ``last
black hole of Congress.''
   Just what comes next is uncertain.
   Frenzel said he would like to become a political analyst - or
``resident sage'' - with a think tank or a private company.
   But he did not rule out a Bush administration post and his name
has come up in connection with the position of U.S. trade
representative. The incumbent, Carla Hills, has been mentioned as a
possible successor to Pete Wilson, who is leaving the Senate to be
governor of California.
   Many former members of Congress, who like Frenzel do not want to
leave Washington, wind up staying on Capitol Hill as lobbyists.
   But Frenzel, plain-spoken as usual, said that was out of the
question.
   ``If I don't want to be the dog,'' he said, ``I don't know why
I'd want to be the tail of the dog.''

<HEAD>FmHA Emergency Loan Practices Come Under New Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal audit by the Agriculture
Department says field offices of the Farmers Home Administration
are often still sloppy in determining whether producers qualify for
emergency loans.
   The department's Office of Inspector General said the review
involved FmHA emergency loans made to help farmers recover from
losses caused by drought and other natural disasters in 1988.
   In its semiannual report for the period April 1 through Sept.
30, auditors said they checked 71 loans totaling $2.1 million in 18
county FmHA offices in four states. Locations were not identified.
   ``Our review disclosed that controls were not adequate to ensure
that loans were made only to eligible farmers in correct amounts,''
the report said. ``We found that county offices approved 43
borrowers for excessive loans totaling over $600,000.''
   The report, which is required by law every six months, said
similar error rates in the FmHA emergency loan program had been
reported in prior audits going back to 1983.
   Emergency loans nationally totaled $73.5 million in the 1989
fiscal year and represent a small part of total FmHA financial
activity. Overall, the report said, the agency as of June 30, 1990,
had more than 1.1 million borrowers who owed about $52.3 billion.
   But the flaws in the emergency loan program raise old questions
about FmHA's attention to proper procedures when dispensing federal
credit and aid to impoverished farmers.
   For example, the report said FmHA had not cross-checked with
other department agencies - notably the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service and the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. - to
determine eligibility for crop losses.
   ``We found 42 cases where FmHA personnel had not received or not
used complete records of acres, yields or benefits from ASCS,'' the
report said. ``In addition, current law requires FmHA to use
average monthly market prices to compute loss amounts; however, we
found that these prices were not always used.''
   The uditors also found the FmHA's national office in Washington
had not ensured that state officials of the agency were in full
compliance with the rules.
   The report recommended that FmHA review emergency loan action
plans of state offices, update loan training, conduct field
assessment reviews and take other steps to improve administration
of the program.
   In a related finding by auditors, the FmHA was said to have
insufficient controls to ensure that county offices consider
prospective borrowers' participation in the 10-year Conservation
Reserve Program when seeking loans or servicing of existing debts.
   Under the CRP, farmers can idle fragile crop land and receive
annual federal rental payments in return. The idled land must be
planted in protective grasses or trees.
   Auditors checked 97 cases in which FmHA borrowers had land in
the 10-year conservation program and found errors in 82 of them.
   Only one of 13 county offices checked had obtained lists of CRP
payments from ASCS offices. And most of the ``farm and home'' plans
filled out for borrowers seeking loans or restructuring did not
show the CRP payments.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Agriculture Department scientists say
orange-red Oriental persimmons can be a rich source of vitamin C.
   Jerry A. Payne of the department's Agricultural Research Service
said in a report issued here on Wednesday that certain varieties of
the Oriental persimmon provide 218 milligrams of ascorbic acid per
100 grams of fruit.
   Oranges and other citrus fruit normally contain 40 to 70
milligrams of ascorbic acid per 100 grams of fruit, he said.
   Payne, who works at the agency's Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut
Research Laboratory in Byron, Ga., said Oriental persimmons are 2
to 4 inches in diameter and should not be confused with the
smaller, seedier American type that grows wild in the South.
   The vitamin analysis was done in cooperation with Ron
Eitenmiller of the University of Georgia.
   ``We've had good success growing the Oriental persimmon as far
north as central Georgia,'' Payne said. ``This is unusual,
especially since the fruit is as tasty and as sweet as those grown
in California, Hawaii and Florida.''
   Roy Lee Smith, who grows fruit and vegetables in Sumter County,
Ga., said he has an experimental plot of Fuyu, a Japanese variety
of persimmon. He said the crop may have promise in the Southeast.
   ``But the market would have to be determined,'' Smith said.
``Timing and selection of the best varieties to grow would be
important.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - China, the United States and the Soviet Union,
in that order, are the top cotton producers in the world. The next
four are India, Pakistan, Brazil and Turkey, says the Agriculture
Department.
   The seven countries are expected to produce more than 81 percent
of the world's estimated 87.2 million bales of cotton in 1990-91,
according to the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   According to recent figures compiled by the agency, the second
seven countries on the list will produce 9.5 percent of the world's
1990-91 cotton. In order, they are: Australia, Egypt, Argentina,
Paraguay, Greece, Mexico and Syria.
   Other countries, not listed, are expected to turn out the
remainder, 9.2 percent of the 1990-91 cotton harvest.

<HEAD>`Right-to-Die' Struggle Had Impact on Nation, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans have not planned for critical
medical decisions they some day may have no control over, but Nancy
Cruzan's ``right-to-die'' struggle made them more aware of their
options, experts say.
   The publicity surrounding Ms. Cruzan's case, said Doron Weber, a
spokesman for the Society for the Right to Die, ``generated a 500
percent increase in the requests we receive.''
   Weber said his New York-based organization has filled 800,000
requests for sample living wills and similar documents since the
Supreme Court's decision in the Cruzan case last June.
   ``The volume from all over the country, which we tracked
directly from the Cruzan case, was incredible. We had to start a
night shift,'' he said.
   John Pickering, a Washington lawyer who heads the American Bar
Association's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly, said Ms.
Cruzan's case ``increased tremendously the public's knowledge of
the existence of such documents as a living will and a durable
power of attorney for health care.''
   ``I think this increased awareness will help prevent the tragic
kind of situation Nancy Cruzan and her parents found themselves
in,'' he said.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, died Wednesday, 12 days after a feeding tube
that had kept her alive in a vegetative state for eight years was
removed at her parents' request. The decision was controversial.
   David O'Steen of the anti-abortion National Right to Life
Committee said her death ``diminishes hope for thousands of
medically dependent people nationwide.''
   Ed Grant of Americans United for Life expressed sympathy for
what Ms. Cruzan's family ``has suffered through the past eight
years.''
   He said, however, that his organization is troubled by ``a move
toward passive euthanasia.''
   The Cruzan family's effort to end the life-sustaining treatment
was the focus of a three-year legal battle that led to a landmark
Supreme Court decision June 25.
   The court recognized a constitutional right of competent adults
to refuse all medical treatment. But it ruled against Ms. Cruzan's
parents because they had not offered ``clear and convincing''
evidence she would have wanted to die.
   The case returned to Missouri courts, and a state judge allowed
removal of the feeding tube after hearing new evidence that Ms.
Cruzan had said she would never want to live ``like a vegetable.''
   Pickering said the Cruzan case also was instrumental in passage
of a new federal law, originally called the Patient
Self-Determination Act.
   ``This is a far-reaching piece of very good social
legislation,'' he said. ``It will require all hospitals and nursing
homes that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding to tell all
patients of their (right-to-die) options under their state laws.''
   The federal law takes effect in November 1991.
   ``Right now, only 5 to 10 percent of all adults have a living
will or a durable health care power of attorney,'' Pickering said.
``I hope this new law will help raise that percentage.''
   All but nine states have specific statutes spelling out
right-to-die rights. But in some of those nine states -
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota - court rulings and
common law provide some right of individual determination.

   In the barracks or the locker room, nobody
thinks twice about threatening to whip, kick or otherwise manhandle
the opposition's rear end. It's different when presidents get down
and graphic.
   That may make it an effective way to turn up the volume when the
man in the White House doesn't think somebody is paying attention.
As in President Bush's holiday message to Saddam Hussein:
   ``If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass
kicked.''
   There are certain amenities about the purposeful, presidential
use of such terminology for public consumption.
   It's not done on tape or on camera, except inadvertently. Better
to have it relayed second hand, leaving just a little room for
doubt that a leader so eminent would talk that way.
   And it can't be done often or it would become too ordinary to
attract attention.
   Besides, there's always a risk of a backlash. A former governor
of Massachusetts, Francis W. Sargent, once used the A-word at a
governors conference, and said his mother called to tell him she
was going to wash his mouth out with soap.
   Then again, it's hardly an X-rated term. And it is right there
in the dictionary: ``Ass: (vulgar slang) the buttocks.'' Bush's
latest usage was widely quoted on radio and television, and in
print.
   After Bush met with a group of congressmen on Dec. 20, Rep.
Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., said the president had told them that he
doesn't think Saddam Hussein understands that there really will be
war if he doesn't get out of Kuwait.
   ``The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed
confrontation is to make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really
aware that, to quote him, that `If we get into an armed situation,
he's going to get his ass kicked','' Gallegly said.
   While others confirmed the remark, Bush was circumspect. Asked
later whether it was an accurate quotation, the president arched
his eyebrows and said nothing.
   He'd been more forthcoming after accidentally putting a similar
observation on the record during the 1984 campaign, when he was
vice president. ``We tried to kick a little ass last night,'' he
said after a campaign debate with Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro, his
Democratic opponent. Bush made the comment while shaking hands with
dockworkers at a campaign rally in New Jersey, unaware that there
was a boom microphone close enough to pick up his words.
   Later on, he said he wasn't apologizing. ``I stand behind it. I
use it all the time. My kids use it, everybody who competes in
sports uses it.''
   Ronald Reagan expressed some doubt about the campaign comment,
saying he wasn't inclined to believe his vice president had said
it.
   Reagan himself didn't go beyond ``keister,'' which is slang for
``rump.''
   In 1983, irked that information about his budget and other White
House business was finding its way into print, Reagan ordered a
crackdown. ``I've had it up to my keister with these leaks,'' he
told his staff.
   No such gentler euphemism would do for Jimmy Carter when Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy was preparing to challenge him for the 1980
Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass,'' Carter said at a White
House dinner with Democratic congressmen.
   ``I was startled,'' said then-Rep. William M. Brodhead, D-Mich.
``I thought my ears were deceiving me. I said, `Excuse me, Mr.
President, what did you say?' And Carter replied, `If Kennedy runs,
I'll whip his ass.' ''
   He did and Carter did. But strong words aren't enough. Reagan
won the White House.

<TEXT>
   A senior national police official says Soviet
troops in eastern Germany are now deserting at the rate of 15 to 30
a week, a newspaper reported today.
   Die Welt also quoted the head of the federal police office,
Hans-Ludwig Zachert, as saying police daily register 20 to 30 legal
violations attributable to Soviet troops, mostly thefts and traffic
violations.
   Zachert said the Red Army troops - based in what was East
Germany until the Oct. 3 unification - are a growing problem for
domestic security, the newspaper said.
   The report comes as many Germans have tried to boost morale of
the 360,000 Soviet troops by inviting some to Christmas dinners or
sending presents to their camps.
   On Christmas Eve, some German families were seen with uniformed
Soviet soldiers in unprecedented strolls in western Berlin's
shopping district.
   Moscow is to withdraw all the troops by 1994, given time by the
Germans to prepare for the shock of providing for them all back in
the Soviet Union.
   Morale among Soviet units is reported dangerously low. In
October, Stern news magazine said extortion, terror and unexplained
deaths had been occurring among the low-paid soldiers.

<HEAD>Genetically Engineered Agent Could Allow Preventive Hemophilia
Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are excited about a genetically engineered
blood clotting agent that could let hemophiliacs treat themselves
with preventive injections, the way diabetes sufferers do.
   The clotting protein made by gene splicing also should end fears
hemophiliacs might catch blood-borne diseases such as AIDS.
   About 60 percent of hemophiliacs in the United States were
unknowingly infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, during the early
1980s. The virus contaminated clotting proteins derived from human
blood.
   New purification techniques have made blood-derived hemophilia
treatments free of HIV, but some experts worry that other microbes
might infiltrate this treatment again if blood remains the sole
source.
   Hemophiliacs have an inherited disorder that prevents them from
making enough factor VIII, a protein essential for blood clotting.
To stop bleeding after accidents and operations and to prevent
damaging bleeding in the joints, they must take factor VIII
injections.
   Two companies are testing recombinant factor VIII, made through
gene splicing techniques, that should provide the treatment without
possible contamination from microbes or impurities.
   ``We are all tremendously excited about this. It represents a
tremendous advance,'' said Dr. Jeanne M. Lusher of Children's
Hospital of Michigan in Detroit.
   Lusher participated in the first large-scale testing of
recombinant factor VIII. The study in today's New England Journal
of Medicine showed that it works just as well as the natural
variety.
   Alan Brownstein, executive director of the National Hemophilia
Foundation, said that absolutely safe factor VIII could allow
hemophiliacs to take regular preventive doses of factor VIII, just
as diabetics take insulin.
   ``It offers the potential for people with hemophilia to have an
interim cure,'' Brownstein said.
   ``The reason why people with hemophilia do not treat themselves
as diabetics do preventively is because we are still talking about
a human-source product,'' he said. ``If we find a product around
which there is zero question, then people could basically be rid of
the potential of bleeding episodes.''
   Last year, Baxter Healthcare reported on preliminary use of its
variety of recombinant factor VIII on two patients. In the latest
report, Cutter Biological described results of testing its
competing product on 107 hemophiliacs. Both forms of factor VIII
are being considered for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   ``The results were excellent,'' said Cutter's Dr. Richard S.
Schwartz. ``We could demonstrate that biologically, recombinant
factor VIII behaves similarly to plasma-derived factor VIII.''
   Most of the patients in the study had been using the genetically
engineered factor VIII for nearly two years. The treatment
effectively controlled their bleeding and caused no unwanted side
effects.
   ``There is an inherent risk with using any human plasma-derived
blood product,'' Lusher said. ``The main advantage is that since
these products are not derived in any way from human blood, there
is no risk of transmitting human blood-borne viruses.''
   The recombinant products also should help assure a steady
supply. Two years ago, hemophiliacs experienced a shortage of
factor VIII after a mix up in HIV screening at the American Red
Cross, a primary producer, forced it to withhold about 7 percent of
the nation's total production.

<HEAD>Ag Department Recalls Franks from N.Y. Store</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is recalling 502
pounds of Canadian kosher frankfurters from a Monsey, N.Y., retail
store after federal inspectors found contamination by food
poisoning organisms.
   USDA authorities said Wednesday that the store, The Meat
Showcase, is cooperating in the recall of ``Continental Strictly
Kosher Beef Frankfurters'' made in Montreal, Canada.
   It is the only store in the United States that has received the
product, said the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   The 14-ounce packages are labeled ``Product of Canada'' and bear
the crown inspection seal of Canada. They also bear the mark
``Establishment Number 472'' and have no sell-by date.
   The problem was discovered by USDA inspectors in a routine
import reinspection in Buffalo, N.Y.
   Ronald J. Prucha, associated administrator of the USDA agency,
said no illnesses have been reported. He said consumers should
return the suspected franks to the place of purchase.
   The suspected bacteria can cause listeriosis, which was
described as ``a rare but potentially serious disease.''
   Listeriosis is believed to pose ``little risk'' for healthy
people, the agency said. But it said those with weakened immune
systems, including infants, the elderly and the chronically ill are
most vulnerable.
   Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms
such as fever, chills, headache, backache and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea. Newborns can exhibit respiratory distress,
refusal to drink and vomiting.
   Consumers with questions about the recall can phone the
department's toll-free hot line at 1-800-535-4555 between 10 a.m.
EST and 4 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. Taped information will
be available at other times.
   Callers in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area can call 202
447-3333.

   President Bush, spending the holidays at Camp
David, Md., faces a full platter of unfinished business when he
returns to Washington next week. And what a difference a year has
made.
   The final days of 1989 found Bush enjoying the holiday season on
a friend's ranch in Beeville, Texas, basking in the success of the
U.S. invasion of Panama.
   The most pressing controversy at the time, it seemed, was
whether U.S. armed forces were right to blast the Vatican Embassy
in Panama City with rock music in an effort to drive Manuel Noriega
out of hiding.
   The toppled Panamanian dictator did flee the embassy into U.S.
hands in early January, and Bush saw his approval ratings in public
opinion polls soar to 80 percent.
   Now, 12 months later, complex foreign and domestic policy crises
confront the president. And none of the major problems seem likely
to have a quick or decisive resolution.
   In the past year, the president abandoned his no-new-taxes
pledge, got bloodied in a knockdown budget debate with Congress and
saw his party lose seats in the November midterm elections.
   He also ordered the largest deployment of U.S. forces since the
Vietnam War, watched the nation slip towards a recession and wound
up taking actions that angered civil rights activists, Republican
conservatives, environmentalists and broccoli farmers.
   The most demanding piece of unfinished business, of course, is
the Persian Gulf crisis - and the Jan. 15 deadline set by the
United Nations, at the administration's behest, for Saddam Hussein
to pull his Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   Bush has not signaled whether he will mount a military strike
soon after that date. And even though it now appears unlikely the
United States will act against Saddam on Jan. 15, Bush told
congressional leaders last week that he surely would not wait as
long as summer.
   There have been no signs that Saddam is any nearer to buckling
to the pressure of international sanctions and the U.S.-led 400,000
troops deployed against him in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
   After months of dashing around the country and the world, Bush
was keeping an unusually low profile in his 11-day stay at the
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland, about
60 miles northwest of Washington.
   ``He just needs to recharge his batteries,'' said a White House
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   He'll need fresh batteries for the coming weeks.
   Congress returns on Jan. 3 - two days after the president - and
his Persian Gulf policy will be the No. 1 topic after both houses
take care of the business of organizing themselves.
   Also facing the president is a decision on a budget for fiscal
1992, the first one under the $500 billion, five-year
deficit-cutting agreement struck between the White House and
Congress in the fall.
   The economic slump and the cost of Operation Desert Shield will
send the deficit soaring, complicating the job of putting together
a budget. The fiscal blueprint will be submitted to Congress the
first week in February.
   Furthermore, Bush apparently is going to abandon yet another
campaign pledge as he works out the new spending plan: his call for
a cut in capital gains taxes.
   Although the administration contends that cutting the tax rate
on capital gains - profits from the sale of stock, real estate or
other assets - would generate growth and gain revenue for the
Treasury, it can't prove it.
   And under the budget pact, anytime a tax cut or spending
increase is proposed, it has to be offset by a tax increase or a
spending cut in another area. Ten days ago, Bush said he would give
up the capital gains idea because he could not find the savings
elsewhere in the budget - perhaps as much as $20 billion, by some
estimates - to pay for it.
   Some other decisions facing the president:
   - He must select a new chairman of the Republican National
Committee to replace his first choice, former national drug policy
director William Bennett, who spurned the offer after being told by
White House lawyers he'd have to give up a lucrative book contract
and outside speaking engagements.
   - He soon must fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board
created more than six months ago with the resignation of vice
chairman Manuel Johnson.
   - He must complete work on a long-delayed national energy
strategy. The plan is snagged in an internal administration feud
over how much the government should involve itself in conservation
efforts.

   A late Christmas card from your
procrastinating Uncle Harold won't be the only thing missing from
your mailbox today. Your annual greetings from the Internal Revenue
Service won't be in the mail either.
   The IRS, after years of sending its tax packages out on the day
following Christmas, has decided to give taxpayers a brief
reprieve.
   This year, the forms will go out on Friday, three days following
Christmas.
   ``We want to move it away from the Christmas holiday to allow
folks to enjoy that period of the year as long as they possibly can
before we throw a wet blanket on them,'' said Arthur Altman,
director of the IRS tax forms division.
   The packages, which cost the government $29 million to print and
mail, have been waiting at local post offices for weeks and a few
taxpayers may have already received theirs from eager-beaver letter
carriers who disregarded the Dec. 28 date.
   However, the bulk of the packages will be distributed in the
period from Friday through the first week in January.
   The tax forms, for the second year in a row, will feature few
changes, a pleasant relief following the massive revisions brought
about by the 1986 rewrite of the tax law.
   Among the modifications this year:
   - The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt from
taxation for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases to
$2,050, up from $2,000 last year.
   - The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize,
rises to $3,250 for a single person, up from $3,100 last year. The
exemption for a couple increases to $5,450, up from $5,200 last
year.
   - Families with income as high as $20,264 may qualify for an
earned-income credit, up from a limit of $19,340 last year. The
maximum credit available is $953.
   - The basic tax rates remain the same at 15 percent, 28 percent
and 33 percent, but the tax brackets have been widened so that more
income will be taxed at a lower rate, thus compensating for the
effects of inflation.
   - Only 10 percent of interest paid on credit card debt, auto
loans and other personal debt will be deductible on 1990 returns,
down from 20 percent last year.
   The IRS said it expects 113 million returns will be filed this
year and that 70 percent of all taxpayers will get refunds. The
average refund last year was $900.
   Two-thirds of all taxpayers are expected to file the long Form
1040, which is used by persons who itemize deductions. The other
one-third will use either the simpler Form 1040A or the nine-line,
Form 1040EZ.
   In an effort to encourage use of the shorter forms, which are
easier to process, the IRS made an important change to the Form
1040A this year which will allow 4.5 million elderly persons to use
it to report retirement income they previously could report only on
the longer 1040.
   These taxpayers will receive the shorter form with an
explanation of the change.
   The IRS is again encouraging people eager for their refund
checks to use an electronic filing service. The fee normally ranges
from $25 to $50 but it usually means a refund check will be mailed
out in two weeks to three weeks, versus the five weeks to six weeks
it takes to process a refund from a paper return.
   People who need tax forms other than those included in their
package can call a new IRS toll-free telephone number,
1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).
   One new feature in this year's tax package represents an effort
by the IRS to bury a myth concerning the pre-printed mailing labels
which many people have feared contained codes making the taxpayer
vulnerable to audits.
   The IRS has gone through and explained what each of the letters
and numbers means on the labels in the hopes that more people will
use them and thus cut down on IRS processing errors.
   ``We are trying to assure taxpayers than none of the numbers in
the label are a secret code that says `Audit this return,' ''
Altman said.

<HEAD>Banking Chairman Says Effectiveness Not Tarnished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dismissing demands that he stand aside, Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr. says he will keep ``plugging away'' as
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee while defending his
conduct against new ethical questions in the Keating Five savings
and loan scandal.
   Riegle intends to convene hearings early next year on providing
money for the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency selling off assets
of defunct thrifts, and he has prepared legislation to rescue the
government fund that guarantees bank customers' deposits.
   He likely will call Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
testify in February - just the type of setting that attracts heavy
media coverage and gives lawmakers a forum for expressing concern
about the victims of a slowing economy.
   But while the Michigan Democrat busies himself for work
overseeing an industry in financial distress, he also must defend
his own integrity against fresh questions in the heavily publicized
Keating Five hearings - and fend off Republican calls to relinquish
his committee chairmanship.
   ``He has compromised himself and he should step down,'' said
Ronna Romney, a Republican National Committee member from Detroit.
``There's no question that his behavior has been highly unethical.
He's become a symbol of this whole scandal ... of all that's wrong
with the system in Washington.''
   The Detroit News issued a similr call earlier this month after
James Grogan, thrift executive Charles H. Keating Jr.'s former
lobbyist and corporate counsel, gave the most damaging testimony
against Riegle since Ethics Committee hearings began Nov. 15 into
the ties between the lawmakers and Keating.
   Grogan, the first Keating insider to go before the panel,
appeared under limited immunity, meaning his testimony could not be
used against him unless he committed perjury.
   He insisted that Riegle had proposed and arranged an April 2,
1987, meeting between chief banking regulator Edwin Gray and four
senators to discuss problems of Keating's Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln Savings and Loan. The institution later was taken over by
the government at an expected cost to taxpayers of $2 billion.
   The 1987 meetings are the focus of the Ethics Committee's probe
of Riegle and Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; and John McCain, R-Ariz. The committee
is investigating whether the senators improperly intervened with
regulators on behalf of Keating's thrift after receiving a total of
$1.3 million on contributions from the businessman and his
associates.
   Grogan's assertion directly contradicted Riegle's sworn
statement to the committee in March that he arranged neither that
meeting nor another a week later involving five senators -
including himself - and regulators from the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board.
   But Grogan also said he did not believe Keating's donations to
the five senators prompted them to assist Keating in fighting
thrift regulators or that Keating expected such.
   Riegle, 52, whose political fortunes have plummeted at home, has
been absent from most of the Keating hearings, as have the other
four senators who are under investigation. He has strongly denied
any wrongdoing. The hearings are in recess until Jan. 2.
   Riegle received $78,250 from Keating and associates for his 1988
re-election campaign and returned the money following newspaper
disclosures of the contributors' ties to Keating, saying he wanted
to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. He denies the
donations motivated him to help Keating.
   In an interview, Riegle shrugged off his difficulties.
   ``It's fair to say I'm a battle-hardened veteran of everything
that comes with this job,'' he said. ``You take everything in
stride, and I've learned to do that. We're just plugging away.''
   Democrats meet early in January to vote on committee
chairmanships, and there's been no hint that Riegle might be asked
to step down.
   In Washington, even the political opposition is standing firm
behind Riegle.
   ``I didn't see any evidence this year that his (Riegle's)
performance had been impaired in the least,'' Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, said.
   Garn said he would reserve judgment on Riegle's future until the
Ethics Committee concludes its work. ``I haven't seen anything that
shows me any ethics violations. But that's a very preliminary
opinion,'' he said.
   Whatever the outcome of the Keating probe, Riegle's political
fortunes seem to hang in the balance. In a Detroit News survey
earlier this fall of 800 registered voters, 62 percent said they
would not vote for Riegle this year had he been on the ballot, and
23 percent said they would. Riegle was elected to a third term in
1988 with 60 percent of the vote.
   That survey was taken before the public hearings began that
produced Grogan's testimony.
   The lobbyist's testimony followed assertions by Ethics Committee
counsel Robert S. Bennett that Riegle ``played a much more
instrumental role in initiating the April 2 meeting with Chairman
Gray than he recalls.''
   Riegle emotionally defended himself in an opening satement last
month.
   His attorney, Thomas Green, cited inconsistencies in Grogan's
testimony and described the disagreement over Riegle's role as
``not a big deal.''

<HEAD>Eastern Europe Could Compete With U.S. Grain Exports n 5 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade analysts in the Agriculture Department
say it is still unclear whether Eastern Europe will emerge as a
long term, thriving market for U.S. farm products.
   In fact, there is a possibility Eastern Europe will develop into
a competitor of American grain producers.
   Mike Dwyer of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said
many people hope these countries will experience rapid growth as
they move toward market economies.
   But it is possible that Eastern Europe may show economic decline
in the short run. If so, he said, that could mean some U.S. export
opportunities as the countries try to make up the gap between
supply and demand.
   Dwyer, whose comments appeared in the January issue of
AgExporter magazine, said he was ``less optimistic'' about U.S.
sales to Eastern Europe over the long haul.
   ``Over the next five years, there is a real possibility that
Eastern Europe (excluding the Soviet Union) could become a
significant net exporter of some bulk agricultural products, such
as grains, and thus emerge as a competitor with us,'' he said.
``Until recently, they have been only marginal net exporters of
grain.''
   Dwyer said he thinks certain sectors will emerge sooner than
others as the Eastern European countries retool their economies and
global competitiveness.
   ``I believe agriculture, primarily grain and livestock, will be
among the region's first sectors to emerge from this transition,''
he said. ``Light industry, such as textiles and leather, also
should do well.''
   Many of the countries already have fairly substantial farm
economies and fertile land, Dwyer said. Consequently, some may
emphasize grain and livestock products for export.
   ``While over the long run this does not bode well for expanding
U.S. grain sales, it does offer opportunities for oil seeds
(soybeans) and meal as a livestock feed for East European herds,
which I expect will increase,'' he said. ``Herd increases, in turn,
may also boost sales of U.S. genetics.''
   But Eastern Europe's desire to export should also create some
demand for U.S. cotton and cattle hides for the manufacture of
textiles and leather.
   ``Over the very long term, as their economies really start to
grow and their incomes rise, these East European countries may
develop into markets for U.S. high-value products'' that have
already been processed, Dwyer said. ``But that is going to take a
while and we can expect intense competition from Eastern Europe
itself as well as the European Community.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Soviet Union has signed a new cooperative
agreement with the Agriculture Department to continue looking for
natural enemies of insect pests. And Moscow sent along hundreds of
parasitic wasp eggs to help seal the pact.
   Richard Soper of the department's Agricultural Research Service
said the eggs - which were laid in larvae of the apple coddling
moth - were turned over to the agency recently by Nikolai Popov of
Kishinev, Moldavia.
   Popov is vice director of the All-Union Institute of Biological
Methods in Plant Protection. He gave the larvae to the USDA agency
on Dec. 20.
   The USDA scientists hope the infested larvae can help conquer
the coddling moth, a major pest of apples in the United States.
   ``This pest is the proverbial worm in the apple,'' Soper said in
a report issued by the agency. ``But parasitic wasps lay their eggs
on or inside the worm. Young wasps that emerge from the eggs then
feed on the worm.''
   Soper said the wasps don't sting people or animals. He is the
agency's national program leader for research on natural or
biological pest controls.
   The new cooperative agreement signed by Popov and USDA officials
calls for further scientific explorations next year in the Soviet
Union and the United States.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Reserve stockpiles of frozen food going into
the holiday season were generally larger than they were a year ago,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Frozen beef was up 17 percent on Nov. 30 from year-earlier
levels. Other inventory increases from a year earlier included:
butter, up 37 percent; cheese, 29 percent; eggs, 29 percent; fruit
juices, 17 percent; chicken, 14 percent; turkey, 29 percent;
vegetables, 18 percent; and potatoes, 7 percent.
   Inventories of frozen fruit, however, were down 7 percent, the
report said. Total red meat supplies were down 3 percent because of
a sharp decline in pork inventories.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Overshadows Bush's Holiday at Camp David</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is spending a quiet Christmas
vacation at a secluded mountaintop retreat, but aides say the
looming showdown in the Persian Gulf is never far from his mind.
   Bush celebrated Christmas with his wife Barbara, his children
and grandchildren in the privacy of the presidential lodge at Camp
David, Md. The menu of the family's Christmas dinner included
turkey, sweet potatoes, green beans and pie.
   The White House declined to reveal other details of the
presidential Christmas, apparently under orders to allow Bush a
well-needed rest after the hectic months that began with Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But Camp David is only 60 miles northwest of the White House,
allowing Bush to be close at hand in case an emergency arises in
the gulf. Aides said that's the reason he called off his annual
Christmas turkey hunt in Texas.
   To keep on top of developments, Bush has been getting daily
reports since arriving at Camp David last Friday for his 11-day
vacation. He spends several hours working each day, spokesman Steve
Hart said.
   The president returns to Washington on Jan. 1, just two days
before Congress, and he is expected to face some pressing questions
from lawmakers regarding his intentions toward Iraq.
   Two weeks later, on Jan. 15, is the deadline set by the U.N.
Security Council for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The council has
authorized the United States and its allies to forcibly remove
Iraqi troops if they fail to withdraw from Kuwait by that date.
   The administration also is still trying to arrange a visit to
Baghdad by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Bush proposed
last month that Baker meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
press home the administration's determination to use all means
necessary to evict Iraq from Kuwait.
   But Iraq insists the meeting take place on Jan. 12, only three
days before the U.N. deadline, and Bush thinks that's cutting it
too close.
   Baker, who said he would be willing to forgo Christmas at home
if Saddam would see him on Dec. 25, spent the holiday in his
hometown of Houston.
   Bush conferred Christmas Eve with his top military advisers -
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Both, just back from five days in Saudi Arabia, reportedly told
Bush that commanders in the field predict U.S. troops won't be
ready to fight until the beginning or middle of February.

   The Pentagon has banned the news
media from covering the Bob Hope tour and toned down the show to
avoid offending the Saudis and prevent the Iraqis from using the
visit as propaganda fodder.
   Hope was to take his show to the Marines in the northern Saudi
desert today, wrapping up a three-day tour.
   The 87-year-old comedian, whose tours for U.S. forces over the
past 50 years have included such sirens as Joey Heatherton and
Brooke Shields, lamented on Tuesday that he had to leave behind
Marie Osmond and the Pointer Sisters.
   The Saudis prohibit female performers.
   Hope joked about having to do an all-male show, with only his
wife, Dolores, to sing ``White Christmas'' as a finale.
   The comedian also told a news conference Tuesday that he
eliminated ``a lot of jokes'' so as not to offend the rulers of
this Moslem desert kingdom.
   ``I know exactly what they're doing. The king's running the
place. They have their religion and their beliefs and you have to
kind of abide by it,'' he said. ``What bothers me is they don't
want any entertainment and they still invited me.''
   Hope is not the first entertainer to be restricted during
Operation Desert Shield. Comedian Steve Martin's visit in October
was kept low-key and Ms. Shields reportedly was asked not to come.
   Most women in the country appear in public completely veiled and
the sexes are not supposed to mingle outside private homes.
   The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Tuesday that it
restricted coverage of Hope's three-day tour for security reasons
and because media coverage ``however well-intentioned, has a very
great likelihood of being exploited by the Iraqis for propaganda
purposes.''
   The Iraqi government has attempted to stir up Moslem
fundamentalist opposition to the presence of Western culture in
Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest sites.
   The U.S. military has been at pains not to offend sensibilities
in this Moslem kingdom - where all other religions are banned.
   Hope said he made seven stops on Christmas Eve, including a show
for 7,000 troops in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
   Among those in the audience at the Riyadh show were Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, and his
deputy, Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller.
   Waller made headlines last week when he said U.S. combat units
won't be ready for war with Iraq by the U.N.-imposed Jan. 15
deadline for Iraqi troops to pull out of Kuwait or face possible
attack.
   Hope said he got ``a lot of laughs'' when he told the troops
that President Bush called Waller and said: ``From now on, you'll
be known by your first name'' - an allusion to Saddam Hussein, who
is also commonly known by his first name.
   Any jokes about Saddam?
   ``I've been working on Hussein a hell of a lot,'' Hope said.
``Saddam, he thinks he's Saddam Santa Claus now. Saddam Claus,
that's his new nickname now. And you know what Saddam is spelled
backwards - Mad Ass.''
   The comedian, who put on nine Christmas shows in Vietnam, said
he hoped these would be his last performances in the gulf region.
   ``I hope we never have another war,'' he said.

   A shooting war in the Middle East probably
would cause sudden turmoil in the nation's securities and futures
markets, but they should recover quickly, most market professionals
say.
   In New York, Big Board officials point to a series of
``circuit-breakers'' developed after the 1987 stock market crash to
slow down computerized trading or temporarily halt it if the market
plunges or skyrockets more than 250 points.
   Should there be a surge in buying, selling or volume, ``these
circuit breakers would serve to slow the market down and give
everyone a chance to assess what has taken place and make an
investment decision,'' New York Stock Exchange spokesman Richard
Torrenzano said.
   ``If you had the outbreak of a sudden, major shooting war in the
Middle East, I suspect that short term the market would go into a
free-fall,'' said Robert Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust
Co. in Los Angeles. ``But I also wouldn't be surprised at all if it
closed higher two or three days later,'' he said.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has said it would stop trading
stock index futures - contracts based on a range of stocks - if the
New York Stock Exchange closed. But the NYSE isn't saying what it
will do in case of war.
   ``I'm not going to say there's a plan in place or not in place
until you know what's been presented to you,'' said Richard
Torrenzano, a spokesman.
   Kirby, a member of the commission appointed by President Reagan
to investigate the 1987 crash, said a suspension of trading ``is
the only fair way to handle this kind of situation.''
   Market shutdowns, except for the occasional power outage in New
York or Chicago, are rare.
   The NYSE shut down at the beginning of World War I, from July 31
to Nov. 28, 1914.
   That was largely because of fears that gold-hungry Europe would
sell off its securities in New York and take the gold home,
sparking a possible economic collapse in this country, said stock
market historian Robert Sobel.
   The New York markets also shut for the end of World War II in
1945 and after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.
   Sobel said he didn't think the stock market will panic if war
breaks out in the Gulf because ``this is an event that we can look
ahead and think about. When it happens people have plans all
ready.''
   The 1987 stock plunge of more than 500 points, he said, ``caught
a lot of people unaware. It's the ones that catch you unaware that
cause panics.''
   Federal regulators say they have plans to head off panic in the
markets should the shooting start - but what those plans are,
they're not saying.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the
stocks, bonds and mutual funds markets, says it has developed plans
for emergencies and has been discussing them with the exchanges.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees futures
contracts in key commodities such as oil, also has planned for
disruptions. A CFTC insider says plans include coordinating

   But ``do we have a plan so that if X happens we'll do this? No.
Because I think whatever X we put down or Y or Z, there would be Q,
R and S on top of that,'' said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Without war, the Dow Jones industrial average - a key stock
market indicator - is expected to break through 3,000 points in
1991, said Yale Hirsch, who produces the Stock Trader's Almanac.
But if the crisis ends badly, the Dow could sink to 2,000 next
year, he added.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   John Tower says it's not what his former
Senate colleagues did to him that hurts, it's the way they did it.
   Tower, a four-term Texas senator and former Republican chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, suffered an ignominious
defeat in March 1989 when the Senate turned thumbs down on his
nomination to become secretary of Defense.
   ``What was happening to me could have happened in an evil,
Kafkaesque society,'' Tower writes in a new book. ``It couldn't
happen in the United States. It couldn't happen in the U.S.
Senate.''
   In the book, ``Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir,''
Tower denies allegations aired before the Senate that he was an
excessive drinker and a womanizer who held close ties to defense
contractors.
   He also tries to settle a few scores.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., is a ``genuine boozer,'' Tower
writes. Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., is the ``Senate bully ... a
study in arrogance and pomposity.'' Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
``has a tendency to resort to flatulent indignation.''
   He says Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee who led the fight against the nomination, was
motivated by presidential ambitions.
   ``If Nunn had suspected that he would end up looking like an
unscrupulous mudslinger who would stop at nothing to achieve his
objectives, perhaps he would have satisfied himself with making a
few critical comments expressing whatever reservations he may have
felt, even to the point of indicating that I was on probation, and
then voting to approve the nomination,'' Tower writes.
   ``But Sam Nunn was blinded by his own ambition.''
   Nunn's press secretary, Scott Williams, said the senator would
have no comment on the book, which is to be published by Little,
Brown and Co. in February.
   Calls to other lawmakers last week also drew no responses.
   Tower says Nunn was upset from the beginning about his
nomination by Bush.
   He believes that Nunn, who played a major role in advising
Michael Dukakis on defense issues during the 1988 presidential
campaign, was upset by Tower's attacks on Dukakis' policies. Tower
campaigned for Bush.
   In addition, Tower had advised former President Reagan to veto
the 1989 defense authorization bill, legislation that Nunn helped
work out. Tower suggests Nunn still was smarting from Reagan's
decision.
   ``I did not regard Nunn as an obstacle. And that was a fatal
misreading of the situation,'' Tower writes in hindsight. ``What
lay before me, however, was not confirmation as secretary of
Defense, but a political killing field prepared by the chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.''
   Tower criticizes the ranking Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, for failing to lead the
fight for the president's nominee.
   ``To keep on good terms with Sam Nunn, he ceded the rights of
the Republican minority to object to a course of action that was
inimical to its best interests,'' Tower wrote.
   Warner, who spoke on the Senate floor on Tower's behalf during
the confirmation fight, was the lone senator to respond to the
book.
   ``You've got to know John Tower as we do. It's his Texas
style,'' Warner said Thursday.
   Tower's attacks on Exon as a heavy drinker are not new. During
Exon's re-election fight against Republican Hal Daub in November,
Tower campaigned for the GOP candidate and made the same
accusations. Exon denied the charges.
   Tower does not limit his criticisms to the Senate. The former
senator believes that White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray's
inexperience in handling the nomination contributed in some ways to
its demise.

   Thousands of the poor, sick, homeless and hungry were showered
with gifts, food and shelter - at least for one day - as millions
of Americans put aside worries of war and recession to enjoy a
Christmas Day of peace and giving.
   Volunteers across the nation served up holiday dinners, sang
gospel songs and even tested the blood pressure of the downtrodden,
while families of servicemen in the Persian Gulf prayed for their
loved ones' safe return.
   ``Most people at this time of year are selfish in one way or
another,'' said Iqbal Emamudeen, one of about 135 volunteers who
handed out turkey dinners to the hungry in Newark, N.J.
   ``You have to liberate yourself spiritually, emotionally and
mentally,'' Emamudeen said. ``I cannot change the world, but I know
for a fact that I can make a difference.''
   In New York City, Mayor David Dinkins was among those serving
dinners to the homeless, while the Citymeals on Wheels program
brought food to some 6,000 elderly people too frail to go out.
   Boston officials opened City Hall to the elderly, newly arrived
immigrants and others who might otherwise spend Christmas alone.
   ``This really means a lot for our first Christmas in America,''
Phuong Ngo, a recent immigrant from Vietnam, said as he sat down
for a turkey dinner.
   In Atlanta, 5,000 volunteers dished out 47,000 dinners to the
hungry and homeless at the Georgia World Congress Center.
Volunteers also provided free haircuts and blood pressure tests as
gospel singers performed.
   ``There's no program in this city that brings us together as a
family - black, white, rich, poor - in this city than this
dinner,'' said veteran civil rights activist Hosea Williams who has
organized the event for 20 years.
   San Francisco's Glide Memorial Church handed out about 6,000
turkey dinners to the homeless, while 50 miles south in Los Gatos,
17 families of soldiers prayed for their loved ones' safe return.
   In New York City, Cardinal John O'Connor prayed for peace, and
in Washington, D.C., political activist Dick Gregory demonstrated
in front of the White House for a peaceful resolution to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Soul singer James Brown, serving a six-year prison term for
assault, used part of his 72-hour Christmas furlough to perform for
4,000 soldiers at Fort Jackson, S.C. The soldiers' holiday leave
was canceled because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But Tuesday was also a day for old-fashioned fun as millions
tried out new toys left under the Christmas tree, partied or took
part in their own special holiday traditions.
   In Lincoln, Neb., Barb Klimet's two children got up early to see
which of the family's 12 Christmas trees Santa left the presents
under.
   ``Christmas is always a neat time,'' Kliment said. ``The lights
were alwys a fantasy for me. This thing has just kind of
mushroomed for us.''
   The lights were also bright at the casinos in Atlantic City,
N.J., were hordes of gamblers were hoping for a holiday visit from
lady luck. They appeared to be boosting the fortunes of embattled
entrepreneur Donald Trump, who operates three casinos there.
   ``I'm sort of amazed we're as busy as we are,'' said Ed Tracy,
president and chief executive for Trump's Atlantic City operations.
``Maybe people are celebrating that we're not at war.''

   Police didn't catch the Grinch, so they
played Santa instead.
   Christmas Day dawned dark and awful for Neona and Dan Calovich
when they returned from her parents' home to find a thief had
kicked in a door to their house.
   The home was ransacked. Thieves even took gifts placed under the
Christmas tree for the couple's two young sons.
   But then officers, dispatchers, jailers and other police
employees arrived bearing gifts.
   ``It has been a very emotion-filled day, a most overwhelmingly
happy Christmas,'' Mrs. Calovich said.
   Officer David Gilgour, who had taken the family's burglary
report, thought of the couple's sons, ages 3 and 18 months, and of
his own 4-year-old boy.
   ``I know how hurt he'd be without any presents,'' Gilgour said.
``And how I would feel myself if I couldn't provide a Christmas for
him.''
   Gilgour radioed police dispatcher Jane Smitka and suggested the
department help the family. By the time he returned to the station,
teddy bears, toy trucks and cars, turkeys, cash and other gifts
were pouring in.
   ``The stuff came from their individual homes,'' police Capt. Don
Huntsinger said. ``In some cases, I suspect, from their own
Christmases.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, a key figure in
the political drama gripping the country, has suffered a heart
attack, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Congress of
People's Deputies on Wednesday.
   The 61-year-old prime minister, a close friend of Gorbachev, was
resting in a hospital after Tuesday night's attack and was no
longer in life-threatening condition, the president said.
   Gorbachev was visibly saddened and spoke slowly and softly as he
made the announcement. ``We wish him a return to health. We're very
sorry,'' he said.
   The deputies reacted with silence, then returned without comment
to their day's agenda on granting Gorbachev more sweeping
presidential powers.
   The 2,250-member Congress, the country's highest legislative
body, had voted Tuesday to eliminate Ryzhkov's Council of Ministers
and create a new Cabinet under Gorbachev's direct control.
   Gorbachev has not indicated whether Ryhzkov would hold any post
in the new Cabinet. Ryzhkov has been a stalwart opponent of a rapid
transition to a market-driven economy.
   Ryzhkov was appointed by Gorbachev to the post of prime minister
in 1985, shortly after Gorbachev's own ascent as Communist Party
chief.
   However, blame for the abysmal state of the economy has been
laid at Ryzhkov's feet. For the past year, lawmakers, demonstrators
and intellectuals have demanded the resignation of Ryzhkov and his
government.
   But Gorbachev has stook by his friend.

<TEXT>
   For Mayor John Landreth, the fourth
flood in 18 months really took the cake. His 50th anniversary cake.
   ``When we opened (the banquet hall) up on Sunday, there was a
foot of water and the cake was floating on the floor,'' said his
wife, Mildred.
   In addition to ruining the party at the Legion Hall, the flood
on Piney Creek caused $500,000 in damage and forced more than 160
people from their homes.
   Now Landreth is ready to take on the Army Corps of Engineers.
   ``We don't need another study,'' the mayor said Tuesday. ``We
need the damn creek fixed. Take what money would be spent on the
studies and get in there and do some corrective work.''
   The creek has been studied by the Corps since 1957, when floods
``almost wiped the town out,'' Landreth said. He witnessed his
first flood in Spring City, 60 miles north of Chattanooga, in 1921
at age 6.
   The Corps last year offered to do a free 18-month preliminary
study, a comprehensive two-year study and finally another 18-month
feasibility study on how to stop Piney Creek from flooding.
   During a three-week period starting in June 1989, the creek
flooded three times and caused up to $225,000 damage. Over the
weekend, more than three inches of rain pushed the creek over its
banks and flooded the town of 2,250.
   ``We know what needs to be done. We don't need somebody in
Washington or Nashville sitting behind a desk looking at it on
paper and telling us what needs to be done,'' the mayor said.
   ``But we didn't qualify for federal disaster assistance last
time. We got no federal help and very little state assistance.''
   The creek drains a 20,000-acre watershed and winds downstream
with two sharp bends near city limits. Straightening the curves
would be the quickest and easiest solution to the flooding problem,
Landreth said.
   The Army Corps of Engineers was unavailable for comment because
of the Christmas holiday. The Corps has jurisdiction over flood
control on many national waterways.
   Landreth said a group of businessmen and a city crew cleared
another problem creek, Town Creek, last spring without a permit.
The creek stayed within its banks over the weekend.
   A businessman wanted to clear out the bends in Piney Creek last
spring and was encouraged to do the work out of sight, the mayor
said. But the man was reported to the Corps, which halted the work,
he said.
   The mayor met Monday with a representative from Gov. Ned
McWherter's office.
   ``If we can't get some cooperation from the Corps this time -
and I'm going to ask the governor to intercede for us - we are just
going to get in there and do it anyway and work on it until we get
stopped and hauled to jail,'' Landreth said.
   ``We can't just keep sitting here, waiting for the next flood.''

<HEAD>Study: Teen Suicide Prevention Programs May Not Be Effective</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COLLEEN DISKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School suicide-prevention programs for teen-agers
can do some youngsters more harm than good, researchers said today.
   Columbia University researchers said they found little evidence
that such programs reduced suicides or suicide attempts, according
to a study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association,
   ``There was some evidence of unwanted effects'' on teen-agers
who have attempted suicide, researchers from Columbia's medical
school.
   Discussing the topic openly often stirred up suicidal feelings,
subjects of the study said. Of those who had tried to kill
themselves before taking part in school counseling, 26.7 percent
thought the programs increase the chances that youths will attempt
suicide.
   ``Attempters exposed to programs were significantly less likely
to recommend that the programs be presented to other students and
significantly more likely to indicate that talking about suicide
makes some kids more likely to try to kill themselves,'' the study
said.
   ``There is a clear need to evaluate such programs to determine
their efficacy and safety.''
   The team, headed by David Shaffer, director of the division of
child and adolescent psychiatry at the medical school, studied the
impact of prevention programs on the attitudes of students in the
ninth and 10th grades who said they had tried to commit suicide.
   The researchers found that those teen-agers continued to believe
suicide was a possible solution to their problems and that they
would be less likely to seek help or discuss their feeling with
peers who haven't tried to kill themselves.
   Suicide is the third leading cause of death among people 15 to
24 years old.
   A psychiatrist not connected with the study said he was not
surprised by the results.
   ``You can't just get kids not to commit suicide by just
educating them about the problem and telling them where to get
help,'' said Dr. Jan Fawcett, chairman of the Department of
Psychiatry at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago and
an authority on suicides.
   ``It's not an intellectual exercise. There's more to it than
that.''
   The study evaluated the impact of school-based suicide
prevention programs on 973 teen-agers, 63 of whom said they had
tried to kill themselves.
   The students were divided into two groups, with 524
participating in prevention programs, including 35 suicide
attempters. The 449 others - 28 of whom had tried to take their
lives - did not participate in the programs, which were conducted
by specially trained teachers.
   The warning signs of young people at risk were described in the
programs, some of which lasted as long as three hours. The programs
were intended to raise awareness of teen-age suicides and
recommended counseling among participants, who were surveyed about
their attitudes before and after the programs.
   Researchers also concluded that the attitudes of suicide
attempters who did not participate in the programs were not
significantly more negative than those who did.
   Fawcett said prevention programs should treat suicide like an
illness, such as depression or stress, which can be treated with
the help of friends, family and professionals.
   The programs must be careful not to focus too heavily on suicide
and should instead concentrate on the factors that often lead to
it, he said.
   ``The problem is deromanticizing suicide,'' Fawcett said. ``Kids
are very suggestible. They see reports about suicide on television
and may begin to see suicide as a way to end their troubles or make
their parents feel bad. They may not have a concept of death as a
final consequence.''

<HEAD>Study: Environmental Illness May Be Mental Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who think the modern, chemical-saturated
environment is making them sick may simply be suffering mental
problems, a University of Iowa research group says. Critics called
their study naive and sloppy.
   Patients diagnosed with the syndrome known as environmental
illness often get sick after exposure to everyday items like
processed foods, newsprint, gasoline and clothing.
   Belief in the condition, also called multiple-chemical
sensitivity, varies in the medical community, with some doctors
doubting its existence altogether.
   ``It's my belief that people diagnosed as having environmental
illnesses in most cases do have something wrong: a garden variety
emotional disorder,'' said Dr. Donald W. Black, who headed a study
at the university's medical school published today in the Journal
of the American Medicine Association.
   Beginning in June 1988, Black's research team studied 23 people
diagnosed as suffering from environmental illnesses. Fifteen, or 65
percent, showed symptoms of past or present mental disorders like
depression, anxiety or obsessive compusive behavior, the study
said.
   In a 46-member control group of healthy people, 13, or 28
percent, showed symptoms of mental disorders, the study said.
   The research was naively conceived and porly set up, said Dr.
Leo Galland, a New York internist who treats people diagnosed with
environmental illness.
   Comparing the mental conditions of environmental illness
patients against healthy people, rather than the mental states of
people suffering medically accepted chronic ailments, was a
critical flaw, Galland said.
   ``Being sick tends to make people depressed,'' he said. ``I
don't think there's ever been a study done comparing healthy
community members with a group of patients who suffer from a
chronic illness that hasn't found more psychopathology among the
patient group.''
   Comparing the mental conditions of environmental illness
subjects with those of people with asthma, for example, might have
proved his claim, he said.
   A group of medical practitioners called clinical ecologists
believe that common chemicals in the air and physical environment
can upset the body's immune system, leading to nausea, respiratory
problems, headaches and other ailments, the study said.
   Some patients have reported hypersensitivity to rugs, paneling,
deodorant, bedding and other everyday substances. Some sufferers
have sought out ``toxic free environments'' by giving up their
urban jobs and moving to the desert or mountains.
   A lack of an acceptable definition for environmental illness, as
well as a lack of an established test for the disease, has led much
of the medical community to dismiss the concept, the researchers
wrote.
   Another critic said even if the Iowa team's conclusions were
valid, toxins in the environment could have contributed to the
mental disorders.
   ``I don't think any psychiatrist can tell me what causes mental
illnesses like depression and neurosis,'' said Dr. Max Costa,
professor of environmental medicine and pharmacology at New York
University Medical School.
   ``Chemicals can enter the brain and produce toxic effects,'' he
said.
   Black's research team also criticized the use of non-proven
treatments on people diagnosed with environmental illness. Those
treatments include special diets, wearing filter masks and using
douches or enemas of spring water, coffee or yogurt.
   ``The variety of treatments seems to be limited only by the
imagination and resourcefulness of the clinician,'' the doctors
wrote.
   The study's findings suggested that many victims of
environmental illnesses turned to clinical ecologists because other
doctors could not provide a reason for their symptoms, researchers
wrote.
   ``The study subjects clearly believed that their clinical
ecologists had something to offer them that others did not:
sympathy, recognition of pain and suffering, a physical explanation
for their suffering, and active participation in medical care,''
researchers wrote.

<HEAD>Government Says 31 Students Arrested For Sedition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government intelligence agency today
announced the arrest of 31 students on charges of forming a North
Korean-directed organization that sought to overthrow the
government.
   The Agency for National Security Planning also said more than 70
other members of the group called Chamintong were being sought.
   Chamintong is an acronym meaning ``independence, democracy and
unification.''
   In a statement, the intelligence agency said Chamintong's goal
was to form a unified Korea by 1995 under North Korean leader Kim
Il Sung's leadership. It said the organization would resort to
armed fighting if necessary.
   The agency said the 31 arrested were believed to be core members
of Chamintong, which was formed in 1988 with guidance from a
clandestine North Korean propaganda outlet.
   Chamintong has about 800 members, the agency said.
   Investigations found that Chamintong has manipulated the
Chondaehyop, a dissident student alliance, to stage anti-government
and anti-American activities in the name of seeking
democratization, it said.
   Chondaehyop has been involved in sometimes violent
demonstrations demanding the pullout of American troops and
overthrow of the Seoul government in favor of unification with the
North, the agency said.
   The 31 arrested included Chondaehyop chairman Song Kap-suk, 24,
a senior at Chonnam University in Kwangju, who was arrested in
October. The agency did not say when the others were arrested.
   The announcement said the agency seized 700 pieces of evidence,
including computer disks containing instructions received via North
Korean radio and printed materials containing Chamintong's
clandestine programs.
   Chamintong members pledged allegiance to Kim Il Sung when they
joined the revolutionary organization.
   The intelligence agency statement urged a national campaign to
crush the nation's pro-North Korean and communist rings, which it
said have about 10,000 regular members overall and can mobilize up
to 200,000 followers anytime.
   Security forces have arrested about 100 radical student leaders
in a crackdown that began in September, when the two Koreas agreed
to open high-level political talks.
   The two Koreas have held three rounds of prime ministers talks
aimed at easing hostility since September but so far have failed to
make any tangible progress because of mutual distrust.
   North Korea has consistently criticized the south for arresting
dissidents and radical students who have made contact with, or
visited, the north.

<HEAD>Government Scientists Cast Doubt on Gene's Importance in
Alcoholism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A finding earlier this year that alcoholism may
be caused by a single gene has come under question by government
researchers.
   The new study did not rule out the possibility that alcoholism
is genetically caused, at least in part. But the study said the
gene in question is probably not especially linked to the disease.
   ``You can look at our data lots of different ways, but you don't
find support for the linkage,'' said Dr. David Goldman of the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
   A study published in April found the gene - called the dopamine
D2 receptor gene - in 69 percent of severe alcoholics studied, but
in only 20 percent of the non-alcoholics.
   Goldman's research team found the gene present in 38 percent of
the alcoholics studied and in 30 percent of people chosen at
random, casting doubt on the earlier report, according to a study
in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   A co-leader of the earlier study said Monday he stands by its
findings.
   ``We never said this particular gene form would be widespread in
all of alcoholism. We're just talking about a group of very severe
alcoholics,'' Dr. Kenneth Blum said in a telephone interview Monday
from San Antonio, Texas.
   Blum is chief of the Addictive Diseases division in the
Department of Pharmacology at the University of Texas Health
Science Center in San Antonio.
   He said the government study had several inadequacies: failure
to adequately define severe alcoholism; failure to screen out
possible alcoholics from the control subjects who were compared
with alcoholics and exclusion of alcoholics who had active medical
disorders, including cirrhosis, which afflicts many longtime
alcoholics.
   Blum's team studied genes from the brains of 35 alcoholics who
had died, compared them with genes from 35 non-alcoholic cadavers,
and reported the results in the April 18 Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   He said his team had since confirmed its findings in genes of 50
living alcoholic subjects.
   Though scientists in general have agreed for years that
alcoholism is probably caused by both genetics and environment,
Blum's published report was the first to identify a particular gene
as a possible culprit.
   Goldman's team studied genes of 40 living alcoholics and 127
living people from a random population sample.
   ``It is always possible that there is a subgroup of alcoholics
out there who have this gene,'' Goldman said in a telephone
interview Monday from Bethesda, Md.
   But his team's study did not support a widespread or consistent
association between the D2 receptor gene and alcoholism, their
report said.
   The body contains an estimated 100,000 genes, each of which is
reproduced identically in the nucleus of every cell and serves as
part of a person's hereditary blueprint.
   Goldman declined to guess how many genes could be important
identifiers of alcoholism.
   ``The important thing that people should take home from this
whole thing is not that there's not a genetics of alcoholism,'' he
said, ``but that we still have a long way to go'' in exploring it.

   Snow fell on upstate New York early today, rain pelted parts of
Texas and freezing temperatures were recorded in every region of
the country as a massive cold front held firm.
   The weather was forecast to begin warming across much of the
West by afternoon before the arrival of a new cold front next
weekend. But across the South, East and Midwest, cold weather
showed no signs of dissipating.
   More than 125 cities set cold-weather records for Christmas Day.
   Highs weren't expected to rise above zero along much of the
Canadian border today, topping out at the 20s in the Northeast, the
30s and 40s in the Mid-Atlantic region, the 40s and 50s across most
of the South, the 50s and 60s in the Southwest and the 30s to the
50s in the Pacific Northwest.
   Florida was expected to get highs in the 60s and 70s. Most of
the state has been spared from the cold wave, although lows have
dropped into the 20s in some northern areas.

<HEAD>Iraqi Information Minister Dead at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohammed Sidiq Shanshal, the first
information minister appointed after Iraq became a republic 32
years ago, has died, newspapers reported today. He was 80 years
old.
   The newspaper reports said Shanshal died Tuesday; one paper gave
the cause of death as ``old age and poor health.''
   Shanshal was a key civilian figure who helped the army topple
the monarchy in a coup in July 1958. He was then leader of the
Independence Party.
   After the coup, Shanshal was appointed minister of information
in the government the army formed under Gen. Abdul Karim Qassim.
   He later broke with Qassim and resigned as minister of
information over the general's Arab policies and his relations with
Egypt.
   Shanshal, like many other pan-Arab politicians in Iraq at the
time, favored close ties with Egypt. Shanshal refused to take part
in subsequent governments.
   Information about his survivors and funeral plans was not
available.

<HEAD>Examiner Says Body Not That of Helen Brach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman's body exhumed from a pauper's grave
earlier this month is not that of candy heiress Helen Brach missing
since 1977, according to local authorities, but a federal agency
says the case is still open.
   Cook County Medical Examiner Robert Stein said that he, a
forensic ornithologist, an anthropologist, a radiologist and
another medical examiner studied the body.
   ``It's definitely not Helen Brach,'' Stein said Monday. ``As far
as we're concerned the case is closed.''
   Mrs. Brach, heiress to the Brach Candy Co. fortune, had an
estimated net worth of $17 million when she disappeared in 1977
after checking herself out of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
She was 65. Her estate is now valued at more than $50 million.
   She was declared legally dead in 1984. Most of her money went to
the Helen Brach Foundation, a charitable trust.
   An unidentified body was found in a suburban forest preserve in
1978. Stein ruled then that the body was not the missing heiress
and it was buried.
   But the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
developed information during a racketeering fraud investigation
that led them to request a new examination of the body this year,
said ATF spokesman Jerry Singer.
   The body was exhumed Dec. 11.
   The bureau still considers the case open and is awaiting results
of forensic tests, including DNA, before reaching any conclusions,
Singer said.
   ``We have to refrain from commenting because all the tests have
not been finished and there's no timetable as to when the
examinations will be completed,'' Singer said.

<TEXT>
   An overheated Christmas light bulb
started a house fire that killed a suburban Detroit man and six of
his nine children, a family member says.
   Meanwhile, police in Wayne County's Canton Township said Tuesday
that more than $30,000 has been raised to help Debbie Dell'Orco,
whose husband, Martin, and children were killed in Saturday's fire.
   Fire investigators initially said the tree fell over, broke a
bulb and started the blaze. But Martin Dell'Orco's brother, John,
said the tree was tied to the ceiling and couldn't have fallen
over.
   Martin Dell'Orco, 38, died of soot and smoke inhalation in the
Saturday night fire along with his children Bonnie, 11; Sara, 9;
Katie, 8; Megan and Michael, 5-year-old twins, and Robert, 4.
   Debbie Dell'Orco, 36, survived the fire with son Adam, 6. Two
older children, Jimmy, 16, and Kelly, 14, weren't home.
   ``He was screaming, `Call 911,'' John Dell'Orco said of his
brother. ``Debbie said she ran into the room and the tree was
standing. It was erect and on fire and flames were shooting out the
top of the tree.''
   Debbie had bought a new strand of Christmas lights for the tree
and had noticed one of the bulbs was hot before she decorated the
tree, John Dell'Orco said. But she and her husband dismissed it, he
said.
   In addition to the cash donations from across the country,
people have offered apartments, clothing, food and funeral
services.
   ``It's more than just caring,'' said Wayne Swanson, a neighbor.
``It's coming from so deep down in the heart, it's unbelievable.''

<TEXT>
   Two children and three adults who were
killed in a Christmas Day fire had planned to celebrate the holiday
at the home of the children's grandmother, an aunt of two of the
victims said.
   The early morning fire, apparently started by a smoldering
cigarette in a living room couch, claimed the lives of India
Hamrick, 25; Ronina Hamrick, 30; Gerald Givens, 39; Rashawn
Hamrick, 4; and Natasha Hamrick, 10. All of them lived in the
2{-story brick house that burned.
   India and Ronina Hamrick were sisters. Ronina was the mother of
the two children, and Givens was the former husband of India and
Ronina Hamrick's mother, Barbara Cosby. Ms. Cosby owned the house
but lives in another neighborhood.
   Jeane Bell, India and Ronina Hamrick's aunt, said on Tuesday
that the victims had planned to spend Christmas at Ms. Cosby's
residence.
   ``Everybody was going to come over (to Ms. Cosby's) for
Christmas morning,'' Ms. Bell said. ``When my daughter told me they
were all dead, in my mind I said, `Let me be dreaming.'
   ``The whole family's close. It's like a terrible nightmare.''
   A visitor to the home, 29-year-old Todd Allen Qualls of
Columbus, said he awakened to the smell of smoke and escaped
through a window, cutting his bare feet on the glass. He said he
climbed down a ladder put up by firefighters.
   ``It all happened so fast, I don't really know what happened,''
Qualls said.
   Fire Capt. Bruce Sutton said all of the victims died from smoke
inhalation.
   Arson experts helped investigate the fire.
   ``We believe it was caused by a smoldering cigarette, but we
took all kinds of samples from the house and have sent them to the
lab,'' Sutton said.
   He said it would be at least Thursday before the lab report was
completed.
   According to Sutton, the 3:15 a.m. fire apparently started at
the end of a couch in a first-floor room.
   A firefighter was treated at the scene for minor burns to his
left ear.

<HEAD>Report: School Bus Contracts Go to Companies with Ties to Mafia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city has consistently awarded the nation's
most expensive school bus contracts without competitive bidding to
companies linked to organized-crime figures, a newspaper reported
today.
   Contractors and law-enforcement officials told The New York
Times that unions influenced by suspected organized crime figures
control the costs and hiring practices of many of the bus companies
the city employs.
   One company that transported disabled children in Brooklyn was
run by a man who has admitted to being a Mafia hit man, the Times
said.
   During the 1989-90 school year, the city spent an average of
$1,701 each to bus 136,000 pupils. Of those, 39,000 are
handicapped; the rest do not live within walking distance of their
schools.
   According to the Times:
   - Robert Bering, who has admitted to participating in Mafia
murders, obtained about $2.2 million in contracts.
   - Julius Bernstein, an official in the Amalgamated Transit
Union, Local 1181-1061, which represents most of the city's 3,000
school bus drivers, acknowledged in an interview that he had met
with men identified as leaders in the Gambino and Genovese
organized-crime families. He said the meetings were unrelated to
union or school bus matters.
   - Frank Dapolito, described by the FBI as a captain in the
Gambino family, is the personnel manager for a group of companies
that have $12 million in contracts this year.
   - Edward Lino, another reputed Gambino captain who was slain
last month, controlled a company that received $8.2 million in
fees.
   Stanley Litow, deputy schools chancellor for operations, said
problems relating to mounting bus costs and organized-crime
influence were ``certainly disturbing.''
   He told the Times that methods of awarding and supervising bus
contracts were being re-examined.
   Local 1181 President John Ambrosio disputed allegations that his
union has driven up the cost of bus contracts.
   ``We have not got a stranglehold,'' Ambrosio told the Times.
``We have stabilized the industry by putting every contractor on an
even keel with the same contract terms.''
   Large-scale competitive bidding for school bus contracts has not
occurred since 1979, the report said.
   Instead, the school board renews existing contracts with
cost-of-business increases. New York City school officials said
bidding is unpredictable.
   The Times said New York pays more per pupil than any other large
district in the country and in many cases spends almost twice as
much as nearby suburban school systems.
   It reported Los Angeles had the second highest per-pupil cost at
$1,639, but that officials there said 70 percent of the buses are
used for integration and that some round trips are up to 80 miles.
   Milwaukee, with competitive bidding, had the lowest big city
cost, at an average cost of $683 per pupil per year.
   The lowest cost was $333 in Fairfax County, Va., which has its
own fleet.

   A Dorothy Parker pun has angered members of an
anti-rape group who say the remark printed on T-shirts lacks
sensitivity for those ``working in the sex industry.''
   ``You can lead a horticulture but you cannot make her think,''
was printed on a $15 shirt to benefit the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
and The Benedum Center.
   ``It is insulting to women who earn or have earned their living
as prostitutes, implying that they are unintelligent, unthinking,
unappreciative of culture,'' said a recent letter signed by 24
members of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.
   ``It wasn't our intention, and I don't think it was Dorothy
Parker's intention, to insult prostitutes,'' said Holly Van Dine,
the trust's marketing director. She said the quip ``shouldn't be
taken literally.''
   Parker, a poet-writer who died in 1967, ``was lacking in
consciousness for people working in the sex industry,'' said Anita
Mallinger, who signed the letter. ``There are women in professional
positions in this city who have worked as prostitutes.''

<HEAD>Albanian Communists Consider Reforms as Election Approaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albanian Communists held a national
conference today to debate radical changes in their hard-line
policies before elections in February, when they will face
opposition candidates for the first time.
   More than 1,000 delegates from local branches of ruling
Albania's Labor Party gathered behind closed doors at the
parliamentary presidium in the center of the Albanian capital,
Tirana, local journalists said.
   During the one-day meeting, delegates were to hear President and
party chief Ramiz Alia propose reforms to the party platform, the
journalists said.
   The reforms were to include opening up the flagging centralized
economy, removing restrictions on religion, and improving human
rights standards.
   The Feb. 10 elections would be the first multiparty ballot since
the Communists took power in 1944 and plunged the Balkan nation
into decades of political and economic isolation.
   Alia reversed 46 years of hard-line policy earlier this month by
allowing the creation of non-Communist political organizations. The
move came after student protests over slum-like dormitories led to
riots and full-blown demands for democracy in Europe's last bastion
of Stalinism.
   Gramoz Pashko, a founder of Albania's newly formed opposition
Democratic Party, said the Communists were trying to win support
and stay in power by promising reform. But he said even sweeping
changes within the Labor Party could not reverse the harm done by
decades of Communist rule.
   ``If the people support the Communists they will do even more
damage to the country and to themselves,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Tirana.
   But he added the opposition would welcome U.S. diplomatic
relations with Tirana ``as soon as possible ... given the new
realities in Albania.''
   ``The United States and all Western governments should have ties
so they can press the government to make political pluralism real,
not just on paper,'' he said.
   Pashko said the Democratic Party would continue pressing the
government for a postponement of the elections to allow the
opposition more time to prepare an effective campaign. Communist
authorities on Monday rejected the opposition calls for a
postponement.
   Alia was expected to propose ``a new, radical platform ... that
will take a critical stance toward the past and try and open up for
the future,'' Shkelqim Beqari, a journalist at the Labor Party
daily Zeri i Popullit, said in a telephone interview from Tirana.
He said the delegates would then debate how the party should
campaign for the elections.
   The first opposition party, the Democratic Party, was legalized
within days and is planning to contest the elections. But although
statues of the late Soviet dictator have been removed across the
country as Alia moves cautiously toward reform, the Communists
still control virtually every sphere of public life, making
effective opposition difficult.
   More than 200 of the hundreds arrested in the rioting were tried
and at least one of more than a dozen people sentenced was given a
20-year prison term. Some others received 15 years.
   The government on Monday rejected the new party's request to
postpone the elections for several months to allow it more time to
prepare a campaign.

<HEAD>Court Sentences 40 to Up to Seven Years Following Riots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FEZ, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty people convicted of rioting during a
general strike earlier this month were sentenced by a court to
prison terms of one to seven years, officials said today.
   The sentences late Tuesday night were the most severe handed
down so far in dozens of trials following the Dec. 14-15 clashes
that left at least five people dead during a general strike in
several Moroccan cities.
   The 52 people on trial were charged with rebellion, destruction
of property, carrying arms and attacking the liberty to work.
   Twelve people were acquitted.
   Fez, the spiritual and intellectual capital of this North
African nation, was the site of the most extensive violence.
Soldiers and police intervened as rioters attacked hotels, post
offices and a police station.
   The government says five people were killed in Fez and 127
people injured and that security forces did not fire shots.
However, the two unions that called the general strike claim that
about 30 people were killed.
   The court in Fez postponed until Jan. 8 the trials of 33 other
people. On that date it will also continue the trial of Mohamed
Titna Alaoui, head of the Fez branch of the General Moroccan
Workers' Union, which along with the Democratic Work Confederation
called the general strike.
   A Tanger court on Friday sentenced 28 people to three- to
five-month prison terms, and a court in Sidi-Kacem sentenced nine
people to one-year terms.
   In Rabat, two opposition parties, Istiqlal and the Socialist
Union of Popular Forces, demanded the government publish the
identities of those hurt and killed in the violence and the names
of foreign powers the government has claimed were interfering in
the unrest.
   The Moroccan government, meanwhile, continued this week its
negotiations with unions and employers on ``priority measures''
promised after the disturbances, the official MAP news agency
reported. Among the measures under consideration are increases in
minimum wages and in social allocations.

   The army leaders who seized power
over Christmas pledged allegiance to democratic principles and
promised to govern in consultation with the elected National
Assembly until elections can be held.
   Surinamese stayed home from work today, a regularly scheduled
national holiday. Their only information on the coup came from
radio and television broadcasts. Newspapers do not publish on
Christmas Day or the day after.
   Leo Morpurgo, editor of the morning daily De Ware Tyd, said
there were no apparent restrictions on the press or on civil rights
following the bloodless coup in this Georgia-sized nation on South
America's northeastern coast.
   In a Christmas Day radio address, the acting army chief said the
military regime would set up an interim government, hold elections
within 100 days and relinquish power.
   ``The army is not bent on having and keeping power,'' said Cmdr.
Ivan Graanoogst, who heads the military police and is No. 2 in the
military chain-of-command. He said a ``non-political'' government
Cabinet would be appointed within a week.
   The United States and Dutch governments condemned the Christmas
Eve coup in the former Dutch colony that toppled the 3-year-old
elected government of President Ramsewak Shankar.
   The coup's mastermind was thought to be Cmdr. Desi Bouterse, who
resigned as army chief just hours before Shankar was toppled.
Bouterse and Shankar had been engaged in a long and bitter dispute.
   Bouterse has not been seen or made any public statements since
the coup.   He ruled this nation of 400,000 people for eight years after
seizing power in a 1980 military coup and has wielded considerable
power behind the scenes since Shankar's government was elected by a
landslide in November 1987.
   Appearing on television Tuesday night, army spokesman Hubert
Eersel said the army would adhere to five principles.
   He said the army would be guided by the constitution - approved
in a plesbiscite in October 1987 - recognize the National Assembly,
and seek the legislative body's guidance on economic matters.
   He said ``the democratic and constitutional state will be the
guiding principle for all proceedings,'' and that all treaties
signed since independence from the Netherlands in 1975 ``will be
respected fully.''
   It was not immediately clear how the coup might affect an
insurgency that has crippled the mining of bauxite - a major export
used in producing aluminum. A peace agreement between guerrillas
and the ousted government was opposed by the army.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty urged
restoration of the civilian government.
   ``We condemn this violation of constitutional order in
Suriname,'' she said. ``We call on the Surinamese military to
restore power immediately to the democratically elected authorities
of that country.''
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it ``sharply condemns the
undemocratic seizure of power by the Surinamese Army.''
   The military notified the government that it was taking control
while Shankar and his Cabinet met late Monday night in emergency
session at the presidential palace, according to a government
official.
   The official said the president and the other officials decided
to go home and offer no resistance, thereby avoiding bloodshed.
   Not a single shot was fired, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
   Reached by telephone Tuesday at his home, Shankar said he and
his ministers were not under house arrest and had complete freedom
of movement.
   ``I'm free to go wherever I want to,'' he said.
   Bouterse, in his resignation statement, cited differences with
Shankar, whom he described as a ``joker.''
   The final straw, Bouterse indicated, was Shankar's alleged
failure to intervene when Dutch authorities denied the military
leader visas and refused to allow him to be interviewed by
reporters on three separate stopovers in the Netherlands this
month.
   Bouterse announced his resignation Saturday on his return from
his latest trip, to Ghana and Switzerland.
   Bouterse and Shankar, however, have been at odds ever since the
1987 election in which Shankar's three-party coalition, the Front
for Democracy and Development, easily defeated the military-backed
National Democracy Party.
   The military leader bitterly opposes the government's attempt to
negotiate settlement of a costly insurgency by Suriname's Bush
Negro minority, who seek better living conditions.
   Bouterse's former bodyguard, Ronny Brunswijk, launched the
guerrilla war in July 1986 that closed bauxite mines in the eastern
part of the country.

   William F. O'Hara, who survived 88 days on
an ice cap in Greenland after a bomber crashed during World War II,
died Monday at Mercy hospital at age 72.
   The cause of death was not immediately available.
   He was the navigator and one of nine crewmen on a B-17 Flying
Fortress that crashed Nov. 9, 1942, while searching for a missing
aircraft. Two crew members and three would-be rescuers died before
the survivors were saved Feb. 5, 1943.
   O'Hara had both legs amputated below the knee as a result of the
ordeal, which was the subject of Col. Bernt Balchen's book ``War
Below Zero.''
   After military service, he went on to serve as register of wills
in Lackawanna County for 12 years and held a seat on the state
Public Utility Commission for 11 years.

   King Michael, Romania's former monarch, returned
to his Swiss exile today after being expelled by the Bucharest
government less than 12 hours after he had arrived o a surprise
visit, his first in four decades.
   The 69-year-old former king returned to Romania exactly a year
after the execution of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a
popular revolution. The monarch had been forced into exile with the
Communist takeover 43 years ago.
   The Romanian government, already facing mounting strikes and
protests by an opposition that accuses it of being a Communist
regime in disguise, apparently feared the visit by Michael might
stir up unrest. It unceremoniously threw him out on the ground that
he had not secured permission to visit.
   After Ceausescu was overthrown, the former king had announced
himself ready to return from exile as head of a constitutional
monarchy ``if my people want me to come back.''
   The National Salvation Front, which took power during last
year's revolution in Romania and won subsequent elections, extended
no invitation for him to visit, and had refused to grant him a
visa.
   In June, the former king accused the Front of leading the
country back toward Communist dictatorship.
   Before being put on a Romanian-chartered flight to Switzerland
this morning, Michael termed his expulsion ``a rather sorry state
of affairs.''
   The plane carrying the former monarch and a small entourage
landed at Zurich airport today, airport officials said. The king
was traveling by connecting flight to Geneva, where he lives.
   Michael had arrived on Tuesday night at Bucharest's Otopeni
airport on his private plane from Switzerland.
   He was accompanied by his wife, Ana de Bourbon-Parme; his
daughter, Sophie; and several journalists and aides. They were met
by another daughter, Margarita, who was already in Romania on a
visit.
   Michael was to have attended a Mass there today and leave
Romania tonight.
   But soon after the group arrived, the Interior Ministry issued a
statement saying the three family members had arrived without visas
and ``crossed the border fraudulently.''
   Sophie insisted that Michael had received a visa.
   ``My father received a visa just like this one,'' she said,
displaying her passport with a separate stamped visa document. She
said officials had taken her father's Danish diplomatic passport.
Michael also said he had a visa.
   Danielle Maillefer, a spokeswoman for Michael, said Premier
Petre Roman had ``strongly advised him not to come, but did not
give a firm yes or no.''
   She said Michael ``felt he has a role to play in Romania,'' and
so decided to ignore Roman's advice.
   The former king, who is of the house of
Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, ruled Romania twice for short periods. He
first succeeded his grandfather, Ferdinand, in 1927 as Michael I,
after his father, Carol, left the country.
   After returning in 1930, Carol acceded to the throne and ruled
for 10 years. Michael was then crowned again and reigned until he
was forced to abdicate when the Communists took power in 1947. He
later declared the abdication invalid.
   During World War II, he ruled briefly under Gen. Ion Antonescu,
who was allied with the Axis led by Nazi Germany. Michael is seen
as important in the 1944 coup that removed Antonescu, allowing
Romania to change sides and support the Allies.
   He helped install a government with a token Communist presence.
The Communists rigged elections in 1947 and forced Michael to
abdicate.

   U.S. Navy sailors boarded an Iraqi
freighter in the Arabian Sea today and fired warning shots in a
fracas with the crew and female members of a peace mission aboard
the vessel, a U.S. military spokesman said.
   In the 30-minute confrontation aboard the 11,333-ton Ibn
Khaldoon, the sailors also fired a smoke grenade and a noisemaker
grenade ``for crowd control,'' said a U.S. Navy spokesman, Cmdr.
Mark Neuhart.
   The vessel, en route to the Iraqi port of Basra, carried 800
tons of sugar, Neuhart said. The cargo was in violation of A U.N.
embargo on trade with Iraq aimed at forcing Saddam Hussein to
relinquish Kuwait.
   A British defense ministry spokesman, quoted by the Press
Association in London, said helicopter-borne U.S. sailors led the
boarding party and British and Australian military men later
followed by boat.
   He said the operation was carried out off Oman near Masirah
Island. The ship was ``secured'' and escorted to a nearby
anchorage, he said.
   Neuhart said the trouble started when the sailors approached the
pilot house of the freighter ``and a number of the crew attempted
to hold the boarding party members back and grab their weapons.''
   He said members of a female peace delegation aboard the ship,
which included Americans, also joined in the fracas, but that
neither the crew nor the women used weapons against the boarding
party.
   He said that in the fracas, ``one of our guys was knocked over
by one of the women.''
   The Iraqi shipmaster claimed that there were two heart attacks
and two miscarriages because of the boardings, but a U.S. Navy
medical officer found the claims unfounded, Neuhart said.
   ``After consultations with the master, he agreed the passengers
did not require medical evacuation and there were no injuries,''
said Neuhart.
   The master agreed to divert his ship to an unidentified port to
discharge the cargo, the Navy spokesman said.
   The ship was carrying about 240 passengers and a 40-member Iraqi
crew. Baghdad Radio said today the women aboard were from 10 Arab
countries, Italy, China, the United States and Japan.
   Pro-Iraqi Arab news reports have dubbed the Ibn Khaldoon ``the
peace ship'' and said it was sailing to Basra in a demonstration of
support for Saddam and his initiatives for solving the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The Ibn Khaldoon went through the Suez Canal in mid-December en
route from Algeria. The shipmaster gave the vessel's origin of
voyage as Aden, Yemen.
   The vessel refused to stop for a search after ``repeated
requests'' when first intercepted by the Australian frigate HMS
Sydney early today. The Sydney, five U.S. warships and the
Britain's HMS Brazen were involved in the boarding.

   Three Jewish West Bank settlers were freed from
prison today after serving less than seven years of a life term for
killing three Palestinian students and maiming two West Bank mayors
in the early 1980s.
   Scores of chanting and dancing settlers carried the three on
their shoulders out of Maasiyahu Prison in the central Israeli town
of Ramle.
   Dozens of Israeli jurists and lawmakers outside the prison
protested the release, saying it will encourage Jewish extremism.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, troops shot and killed a
Palestinian today after he stabbed three soldiers patrolling the
Shati refugee camp, the army said.
   Palestinian reports identified the slain man as Ala Abdul-Latif
Obeid, 30, from Shati. Doctors at Gaza's Shifa Hospital said he was
shot at least 30 times.
   His death brought to 780 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis during the 3-year-old uprising against the occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Another 322 Palestinians have been
slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of helping Israel.
Fifty-seven Israelis also died in the violence.
   Two of soldiers who were stabbed were in fair condition at Tel
Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv and the third was treated for a minor
wound at Soroka Hospital in Beersheva, the army spokesman's office
said.
   The three settlers freed today were the last of a 28-member cell
called the ``Jewish underground'' to be released from prison.
   The group carried out bombings and attacks aimed at Palestinian
officials, mosques and the Islamic College in the occupied West
Bank.
   Menahem Livni, the leader of the group who as released today,
said he was not sorry for what he did, though officials who reduced
the sentences had said the three settlers expressed remorse.
   ``The use of the word regret in this case is childish,'' Livni
told Israel radio after he left prison with the two other convicted
settlers, Shaul Nir and Uzi Sharbav.
   Livni and other settler leaders claimed the group was pushed to
violence because the government didn't crack down hard enough on
Palestinian militants.
   ``There is a grave shortcoming in the way the government is
dealing with Arab terror. This shortcoming has persisted for 10
years,'' Livni said.
   In Israel, a life sentence usually means the inmate must serve
at least 20 years. There is no death penalty, except for Nazi war
crimes.
   President Chaim Herzog reduced the sentences of the three men to
10 years in 1989 after being ``convinced that the three had
expressed unambiguous and honest regrets,'' the president's
spokesman said at the time.
   Two weeks ago, a parole committee cut the terms by another third
for good behavior.
   ``This is a message of contempt for human life, of making a
difference between one type of life and another, and it violates
the basic tenet of equality before the law,'' said Yitzhak Zamir, a
former Israeli attorney general protesting outside the prison.
   The three settlers released today had been jailed since they
were arrested in April 1984. All three were convicted in July 1985.
   Livni was convicted of masterminding three June 1980 car
bombings that maimed two West Bank mayors, Bassam Shaka of Nablus
and Karim Halaf of Ramallah, and blinded an Israeli police
explosives expert.
   Shaka, wheelchair-bound after losing his legs in the explosion,
said the early release was part of Israeli government policy to
``encourage extremists to act against Palestinians.''
   Nir and Sharbav were found guilty of breaking into the Islamic
College in the West Bank town of Hebron in July 1983, throwing a
hand grenade and firing wildly. Three students were killed and 30
wounded in the attack.
   Livni, who planned the attack on the college, said the victims
``were not innocent.
   ``The Islamic college is a hornet's nest of terror, and there is
nonstop incitement there,'' Livni said.
   The ``Jewish Underground'' was also blamed for unsuccessful
attempts to plant bombs on five Arab buses in east Jerusalem and to
blow up the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's holiest monuments.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.

   Dec. 23
   The Oregonian, Portland, Ore., on the Soviet Union:
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's surprising
resignation is a tremendous shock to the West on two counts: It
potentially takes a Western-looking and trusted negotiator from a
key position. Shevardnadze's reason - a reactionary trend toward
dictatorship - shows how uncertain the Soviet Union's future,
including its relationship with the West, really is.
   Shevardnadze has been a key associate of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, and that team has been a good one from the
Western perspective. The international result has been breathtaking
- the effective release of Eastern Europe from the Soviet grip and
the breakup of the Warsaw Pact as a military force.
   Within the Soviet Union, however, the situation is chaotic. A
political revolution of rising expectations has unleashed yearnings
for independence among various Soviet republics.
   The food supply and other economic indicators have gotten worse.
Many are calling for forcible imposition of central control.
   It's no surprise that such disorder brings cries for order at
any cost. But Shevardnadze's warning is as chilling for the West as
for the Soviet Congress that he issued it to: ``Dictatorship is
coming - I say this with all responsibility. Nobody knows what kind
of dictatorship it will be, and who will come - what kind of
dictator, and what kind of system.''
   From the Western perspective, the hope is that reform doesn't
break down in the Soviet Union. The reactionaries Shevardnadze
warned against are likely to hold the old, brooding Russian view of
the world, particularly the West, as a threat and never to be
trusted.
   The best policy for the West is one of benign non-interference -
to show we are ready to be friends with whatever manifestation the
Soviet Union takes if it is equally ready.
   We can hope for reform, but must be ready to work with whatever
results.
   ---
   Dec. 24
   The Birmingham (Ala.) News on the Soviet Union:
   ... Shevardnadze's resignation on principle certainly is
something we haven't seen much of here in the West from Soviet
political leaders. In the past, those moves took place behind the
Kremlin's dark walls.
   And Shevardnadze's warning that if a dictatorship is created,
there's no guaranteeing who the next dictator will be must be
considered.
   But it's clearly a warning more for Gorbachev and the Soviet
people to consider than for us. We've seen Soviet dictators before;
our way is clear.
   We must maintain a strong military force. We have to keep the
NATO alliance viable. Arms reduction talks must continue, but our
negotiators should be as diligent as ever in assuring that any
agreement reached is verifiable and enforceable.
   And while we might prefer dealing with Gorbachev and our
interests may best be served if he remains the Soviet leader, we
can't bank solely on him.
   If Shevardnadze was trying to tell us anything by his abrupt
resignation, that probably was it.

   Dec. 23
   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the Soviet Union:
   For a year now, everybody has been celebrating the end of the
Cold War. Recent events in the Soviet Union, however, might make us
more comfortable with the word ``truce.'' As disturbing as it is,
Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation as Soviet foreign minister at
least concentrates the attention of everyone, East and West, on the
seriousness of the crisis in the Soviet Union. ...
   Does Mikhail Gorbachev really stand on the side of democracy and
openness, and how far is he willing to go to fight for these
principles? His enemies are at the gates, perhaps within them, and
he can't dither too much longer before casting his lot.
   The lesson for the West: That we should not tie our plans too
closely to individual leaders in a place as unpredictable as the
Soviet Union. And we should not necessarily expect the more benign
regime of the recent past to continue.
   It is worrying that powerful forces have expressed
ever-increasing resentment about the Soviets' declining world
influence, about the loss of control of Eastern Europe, and so on.
The Soviets will still be in a position to threaten the West if new
leaders should decide to act on these resentments.

   San Francisco Chronicle on the Persian Gulf:
   Generals have been known to fire from the verbal hip, sometimes
with a naive insouciance about just what it is they are saying -
and their words' potential consequences.
   In the case of Lieutenant General Calvin Waller, however, this
deputy commander of American forces in the gulf was simply being
candid about what many have already intimated: American troops are
not yet at peak strength and efficiency for what may be an
extremely difficult desert operation.
   His words take some of the pressure off January 15, that looming
date on which seemingly Saddam would retreat, or we would attack.
Generals may be isolated, but they sense the hazards of war more
acutely than diplomats.
   Let the attack come, if it must, when we are ready.

   Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, on minority scholarships:
   The Bush administration's partial retreat from its assault
against college scholarships for blacks and other minorities was
wise. But it did not go far enough.
   In shifting gears rapidly and with clear nudges from an
embarrassed White House, Michael L. Williams, assistant secretary
for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, left standing
at least part of his original and unfortunate ban on scholarships
designated for minorities. ...
   In retreating, however, Williams said colleges could award such
scholarships without penalty as long as the money came from private
donations or federal funds designed to aid minority students. He
then said colleges would not be allowed to use money from their
general operating budgets for scholarships based on race. ...
   How such a far-reaching policy could have been set in motion
without presidential knowledge defies understanding. Why it was not
totally reversed is now even more of a mystery, especially since
Bush made it clear ``I've long been committed'' to such
scholarships.

   The Repository, Canton, Ohio, on the war on drugs:
   Let's not get too excited about those government figures that
show a drop in the use of cocaine over the last five years, let's
just be cautiously optimistic.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the
latest figures show some progress in the effort to change attitudes
and drug habits, and President Bush said the statistics demonstrate
that ``our hard work is paying off.''
   Maybe so, but we're a long way from being out of the woods. The
statistics also reflect the fact that many adolescents are
experimenting with drugs and the number of people who use cocaine
daily has increased since 1988.
   This means the nation has a long way to go before anyone can
declare that the drug menace is under control. We all must keep
fighting.

   The Press-Courier, Oxnard, Calif., on commercial banks:
   Contrary to the Chicken Little scenarios gaining currency on
Capitol Hill, the banking industry is not about to go the way of
the beleaguered savings-and-loan system.
   For starters, banks have been more tightly regulated than the
thrifts. That stricter oversight is one reason banks made $26
billion last year, while the S&amp;L industry lost $19 billion.
   Many thrifts disintegrated during a period when the government
gave them a free hand to make risky investments under the cover of
federally guaranteed deposit insurance. Banks always have been
subject to much stricter government control.
   In addition, many failed S&amp;Ls were undercapitalized and thus
vulnerable to looting by larcenous managers. As publicly held
corporations, major banks are required to open their books to
public scrutiny, so such abuses are much easier to detect promptly.
   Despite several weak years, the banking industry is still
capable of regaining its financial health with a timely assist from
Congress ....

   Dec. 24
   Chicago Tribune on the elections in Haiti:
   Last week's elections in Haiti were praiseworthy for what didn't
happen as well as for what did. Unlike in 1987, when 37 people died
in election day violence at the hands of thugs believed backed by
the army, the military this time provided security at the polls
rather than trying to subvert the democratic process.
   Voting was generally peaceful as 70 percent of registered
Haitians turned out to elect Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a priest
who advocates liberation theology, by a sizeable majority. ...
   Aristide appealed to the young and the poor by stressing
self-reliance, social justice, economic reform and the elimination
of corruption. In a country where annual per capita income is under
$400, the poor are the constituency to champion. From now on,
though, it will be the powerholders - the military, business
leaders, landowners - who can be expected to watch the
priest-president's every move, looking for missteps to exploit for
their selfish ends.
   ---
   Dec. 19
   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on the messiness of
democracy:
   Watching former dictatorships hold elections, you realize what
inexperience with freedom means. What looks to a hardened Westerner
like the normal rough-and-tumble of a campaign may shock and
mortify a Pole.
   In any event, slander charges have been brought against
Stanislaw Tyminski, defeated in Poland's recent presidential race.
   A curious upstart candidate who returned from 22 years in Canada
and Peru to run from president, Tyminski got the world's attention
by outpolling the prime minister in the first round. But then he
lost by a big margin to Lech Walesa two weeks later after a bitter
campaign.
   Tyminski enraged Poles with his Communist connections, shady
past and fierce attacks on the prime minister and Walesa. ... One
local prosecutor overreacted, however, when the candidate falsely
accused the government of selling off state property too cheaply.
If convicted of insulting the Polish state, Tyminski could go to
prison for six months to eight years.
   One sympathizes with the wish that democratic politics could
always be scrupulously fair, campaigns always clean. But veterans
of democracy know better.
   They know, too, that the way to counter a candidate's lies is by
exposing them publicly - not by trotting out the very law the old
Communist government used to silence dissidents or anyone else it
wanted to punish.

   Police today arrested a man for allegedly
killing his mother with an electric circular saw as she slept on
Christmas Eve.
   Detectives said Clifton Williams, 30, linked several extension
cords together and savagely attacked his 50-year-old mother, Dessie
Williams, in her bed leaving her in a pool of blood in a
second-floor hallway of their home.
   The suspect, who relatives said has a history of mental
problems, was arrested at his home this morning after being at
large since Monday.
   An arrest warrant charges him with first-degree murder and
possession of a deadly weapon.
   The body of Mrs. Williams, a hospital housekeeper, was
discovered Monday by her daughter, Sheila Mayor, 33.
   ``I didn't have to get up the stairs all the way to see my
mother. I screamed and ran out of the house,'' she said.
   Mayor and her other brother, Norman Williams, said Clifton
Williams had been diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic.
   Medication kept his condition under control, they said, but he
was prone to irrational behavior when he would refuse to take his
pills. He had gone a long time without his medication, they said.
   ``He was different from all of us,'' Mayor said. ``You do
something one way and he'd do the opposite.''
   ``But we always felt he didn't have the capability of hurting
anybody,'' Norman Williams said.
   Clifton Williams kept the electric saw in his bedroom, using it
at times to cut wood into pieces, said Mayor.

   Emergency medical care at a Chinese zoo saved two
star performing pandas that had become critically ill because of
intestinal problems, an official newspaper reported.
   The Liberation Daily said Tuesday that the pandas at the Fuzhou
Zoo in southeastern Fujian province were near death when they were
diagnosed as having acute intestinal inflammation and intestinal
blockage.
   The diagnosis was made early this month after zoo officials held
urgent consultations with medical and animal experts, the newspaper
reported.
   After nine days of special treatment, Qingqing and Yuanyuan had
recovered, it said.
   The report said Qingqing, 15, and Yuanyuan, 9, have performed
for audiences around the world, including stops in the United
States, Australia and Hong Kong. Their popular stunts include
riding bicycles, doing somersaults and dunking a basketball.
   Fewer than 1,000 of the endangered giant pandas still live in
the wild, most of them in southwestern China near Chengdu.

outbreak of rabies that has left one 8-year-old boy dead.
   The outbreak also has killed camals and other tribal livestock,
and it is believed to be centered in northern Oman near villages
surrounding Ibri, 200 miles from the capital.
   The boy who died of the disease was the first documented case of
human rabies infection in the sultunate.
   A task force from the World Health Organization will work with
state health and agricultural officials to try to stop the spread
of the disease.
   As part of the effort, police will shoot wild dogs and other
animals that can carry the disease.
   Ministry of Health spokesman M.S. Elbualy said the situation
``has been a matter of concern but it is under control.''
   ``We are looking into methods of introducing oral bait
containing a vaccine which will enable these wild populations in
effect to vaccinate themselves against rabies and to prevent
further spread of the disease,'' he said.

   The Daily Telegraph, London, on the Soviet Union:
   The resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze ... provides dramatic
confirmation of what the outside world has suspected fr months -
that the Soviet Union is teetering on the brink of dictatorship.
The enormous authority which Parliament has handed to Mr.
Gorbachev, his own prevarication over radical changes and his
frequent references to the importance of law and order suggest that
he is prepared to halt, or even reverse, internal reform for the
sake of holding the country together.

   The Independent, London, on the Soviet Union:
   The lights are going out in the Soviet Union. The resignation of
Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze is the despairing gesture of a sincere and
exhausted man who does not want to be associated with the journey
into darkness. Because he has supported reform so fully, he takes
with him a large portion of Mr. Gorbachev's credibility. He will
also be a loss to his country in other ways, for he played a
central role in its opening to the world and its rapprochement with
the West.

   The Sunday Telegraph, London, on the Soviet Union:
   Much Western piety surrounds Western fears of Soviet
``dictatorship.'' Doubtless, it would be bad in comparison with
Western democracy and a free market. But Gorbachev seems incapable
of creating that happy combination. The democracy he has produced
is, it seems, a drag on the free market.
   Instead of accepting the necessity for unemployment straight
away, as Mrs. Thatcher did when she started reforming the British
economy in the early Eighties, Mr. Gorbachev encouraged people, in
the name of democracy, to express dissent if they thought he was
doing things wrongly. Those with vested interest in the existing
order slowed him down. The Soviet Union now has the blessings of
political freedom but not the blessings of economic freedom.
   A ``dictatorship'' might well be secure enough to withdraw
guaranteed employment, and thus force workers to emerge from their
age-old sloth. It could break up the collective farms and parcel
them out among private owners just as those earlier dictators, the
first Bolsheviks, did the opposite. Farmers would then have the
incentive to produce food for the city shops.
   Democracy and the free market are not dependent on each other.
That they exist together in the West is because of something akin
to an evolutionary miracle. Asian countries with free markets have
become rich without much democracy. Britain herself was the richest
country in the world long before most of her people had the vote.
   Naturally, we in the West fear a new Soviet dictatorship because
we fear it might revive the Soviet military threat to us. That is
the only good reason for fearing it. We should not continue
sentimentally to suggest that Mr. Gorbachev's freedoms, and Mr.
Gorbachev himself, are essential to the well-being of the Soviet
people.

   The Times, London, on the Persian Gulf crisis:
   The Gulf confrontation has revived the spirit in which the
United Nations was conceived, a force for world order through which
the civilized nations could join to counter aggression, notably
aggression against small states. That many Arab and Third World
nations have aligned themselves with this vision of a new world
order is as significant as the unity between the superpowers.
   What has emerged in the past six months is the possibility of a
total realignment in the vast military might built up during the
cold war, a realignment in the cause not of regional self-defense
but of world order. The world ill-serves itself by criticising the
pain through which the United States is now passing as it debates
its inevitably dominant role in this order.
   American power, for all its inadequacies, its hesitations, its
ineptitudes, remains unquestionably the best hope that civilized
standards will triumph. A high price may yet be extracted. The Gulf
may erupt and swiftly give the lie to too much Christmas optimism.
But war has never been a painless route to a greater peace. The
year fast closing has shown a glimpse of that peace, and marked out
the route. There have been few more hopeful years than 1990.

   Dec. 20
   Straits Times, Singapore, on Cambodia:
   The irony might as yet turn against Hanoi and its Phnom Penh
satellite. It is not they, but the battle hardened and logistically
strong Khmer Rouge that can gain most from a breakdown of the peace
process.
   Without a return of more Vietnamese troops to Cambodia - or the
even more unlikely arrival of other sympathetic foreign forces -
the Phnom Penh regime is no position to deal with the Khmer Rouge
militarily.
   It would appear to be in the interests of all concerned,
therefore, for Vietnam and its lackeys to try and make a success of
the talks on Cambodia opening in Paris this week.
   Using sovereignty as a wedge against peace is not only
unsustainable, but might prove to be counter-productive. If there
is no peace, what Cambodia will have is not sovereignty, but war.
   The Khmer Rouge has never been known to find that preference
distasteful.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli newspaper reported today that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will likely meet Saddam
Hussein in Baghdad for talks on Jan. 9, but a U.S. official said no
date for any negotiations had been set.
   The independent daily Maariv attributed the report to accounts
reaching Jerusalem from Israeli diplomats, based ontheir talks
with U.S. colleagues.
   But in Washington, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty
said there was no such agreement on talks aimed at resolving the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Our embassy in Baghdad is in almost daily contact with the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry. There has been no Iraqi movement on the
question of dates,'' she said. She declined to elaborate.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry said it had no information on any
meeting between Baker and the Iraqi president. Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, also said he had no
knowledge of such a proposal.
   Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington,
also said: ``We have no knowledge of anything of the sort.'' She
called the newspaper report ``pure speculation.''
   Maariv said the meeting was set amid apparent secret
negotiations between the United States and Iraq.
   The Iraqi president has said for months that any resolution of
the gulf crisis should be linked to a settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Saddam has recalled his ambassadors
from the United States, the United Nations and several Western
European nations in past days, giving rise to speculation that a
new diplomatic initiative was in the works.
   The paper said senior officials in Washington told Israeli
representatives that Baker would agree to visit Baghdad on Jan. 9,
despite its proximity to the Jan. 15 United Nations ultimatum for
an Iraqi troop pullout from Kuwait.
   Saddam has previously offered to receive Baker in Baghdad on
Jan. 12, but the White House has rejected that date as being too
late. It has said any date after Jan. 3 would not be acceptable.
   Saddam is also said to be demanding that the U.N. Security
Council pass a resolution linking Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait to a
settlement of the Palestinian issue. The Israeli newspaper Hadashot
quoted the Jordanian daily Al Shaab as saying Saddam would announce
such a plan in the next few days.
   The United States and Israel both have opposed any linkage
between the Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait and Israel's 23-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Maariv said a Jan. 9 Baker-Saddam meeting could be linked to
plans by a top aide to Baker, Dennis Ross, to visit Israel on Jan.
7 to discuss new Middle East peace proposals.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said Ross was expected to come to
Israel on Jan. 7 or 9.
   The State Department appears to be putting together a proposal
for opening peace talks between Israel and Arab countries in tandem
with holding municipal elections for 1.7 million Palestinians in
the occupied territories, Maariv said.
   Maariv also reported ``military movement'' along Israel's border
with Jordan, and Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
warned Iraq may try to use Jordan as a springboard for action
against Israel.
   Shomron said in a statement broadcast on Israeli radio stations
that Jordan was ``liable to find itself - despite its will or that
of its leaders - caught up in Iraqi moves.''
   An army spokesman declined comment on the reported military
moves along the Jordan frontier. The military routinely refuses
comment on reports of military maneuvers.
   The spokesman, whose name cannot be used under army regulations,
added there was no change in the army's level of alert since a
heightened preparedness was declared at the outset of the gulf
crisis.

   Shopkeepers across the country looked for bargain-hunting buyers
today, hoping to clear out slow-moving holiday merchandise that
made this a lackluster season.
   Today is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the
year, as hordes descend to return gifts and comb aisles for
after-Christmas deals.
   ``Generally, I think retailers would be quite pleased if their
sales matched what they were a year ago,'' said David A.
Williamson, a retail analyst for the Advest Group Inc., an
investment research company in Hartford, Conn.
   ``Profits will be at least 10 percent below a year ago,'' he
said today.
   ``Consumers were very tight with their dollars,'' Williamson
said. ``Retailers had to be very promotional just to get customers
into the stores, let alone buy stuff.''
   Prospects for a reversal of the lackluster holiday shopping
season were slight, with much of the country mired in economic
recession, but buyers who take advantage of steep markdowns on
Christmas cards, decorations and wrapping paper might help ease
storekeepers' pain somewhat.
   Pre-Christmas sales were hurt by the economic slowdown,
especially in the Northeast, and fears of possible harder times if
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, analysts said.
   ``We're slightly below expectations,'' said Matthew Howard,
senior vice president for marketing at Sears, Roebuck and Co., the
nation's largest retail store chain.
   A surge in the three days before Christmas helped, he said
Monday. Other high-profile retailers also reported an 11th-hour
jump in sales, but the extra business wasn't considered enough to
turn the season around.
   Retailers traditionally count on Christmas sales for up to half
of yearly receipts.

<HEAD>Chinese Remember Mao, Not Always Respectfully</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The line was short Wednesday as a bitter wind
whipped around the Mao Tse-tung Memorial Hall, where the late
revolutionary's body lies under glass.
   Even on Mao's 97th birthday, few ordinary Chinese seem
interested in remembering their former leader, who died 14 years
ago.
   When they do remember, it's not always with respect.
   There's a joke that says senior leader Deng Xiaoping, seeking
advice, telephoned the late Premier Chou En-lai in heaven and Mao
in hell. When Deng got the bill, there was a huge charge for the
long-distance call to heaven but no charge for calling Mao.
   ``Local calls are free,'' the operator explained.
   Other jokes make fun of Mao's infatuation in the 1930s with
movie actress Jiang Qing, for whom he divorced his wife. He married
Jiang, who became the screeching, violence-inciting policewoman of
the arts during the 1966-76 leftist Cultural Revolution.
   The Cultural Revolution remains the main blight on Mao's image
as leader of the Communist struggle against imperialism and founder
of what is officially called New China.
   During the reformist 1980s, Mao's heirs in power were too busy
dismantling his farming communes and rebuilding the legal
structures he destroyed to spend much time commemorating him.
   But since the party was challenged by huge pro-democracy
protests last year, Mao has made a bit of a comeback in official
circles.
   Activities to mark the birthday were more numerous than in
recent years, and included performances of Mao's poetry set to
music and scholarly forums on ``Mao thought.''
   The People's Daily said a new book was published compiling
remarks by Mao that could apply to the recent collapse of socialism
in other countries, reflecting the party's position that his ideas
remain a living, relevant force.
   At the Mao Memorial in Tiananmen Square, however, there was
nothing to mark the day as different from any other.
   ``Line up four across,'' a museum guard barked at Chinese
visitors, most speaking in out-of-town accents, who waited to enter
at mid-morning. They filed through in groups of about 50, one group
every five minutes or so, many ignoring the sign at the door that
said: ``Please take off your hat.''
   Guards allowed visitors little time to pay respects to Mao, who
lies under a national flag in a glass coffin. Only his face,
preternaturally pink and shiny, is exposed. Visitors were ushered
along the sides of the room, separated from the coffin by at least
10 feet and by large, clear plastic partitions.
   Memorial officials said attendance for the day was about 17,000,
but the figure seemed exaggerated. Souvenir vendors outside,
selling plastic thermometers bearing Mao's picture and Mao Tse-tung
Memorial Hall chopstick sets, say daily attendance is generally
under 5,000.
   The memorial was closed for most of 1989, ostensibly so the
building could be repaired. However, a Westerner who first saw
Mao's body several years ago said it appeared some touchup work
also was done on the body.
   Officials said Mao's one surviving son, one of two daughters and
three grandchildren visited the memorial and brought flower
wreaths, as they do each year. Ordinary visitors were not allowed
to see the family, who are rarely mentioned in the official media.
   It was not known if Mao's widow, Jiang, now 74 and believed
still in prison, marked the day in any way.
   Filming recently began in Beijing of yet another movie about
Mao, following several similar war-era epics last year. The new
movie, about the death of a son in the Korean War, will try to show
a new side of the stern leader, his human face and love for his
family, the studio said.
   A scene shot in the ballroom of the historic Beijing Hotel
showed Mao and several dozen aides, all in their 50s and 60s,
fox-trotting with a host of pigtailed teen-age girls. Jiang was not
shown.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping made his first public
appearance since July, voting in citywide elections in the capital
on Wednesday. The 86-year-old leader, widely believed to be
suffering from cancer, appeared frail.
   Deng was shown on state television moving steadily but a bit
shakily up to the voter registration table, where he sat down to
sign his name. His daughter held his arm as he walked to the ballot
box and dropped his ballot in.
   However, the official Xinhua News Agency described Deng as
walking vigorously to the polling station inside Zhongnanhai, the
Communist Party's vast, red-walled compound in central Beijing.
   ``With a beaming smile on his face, Deng received a voting slip
from a young election worker after showing his elector's card,''
Xinhua said.
   Deng had not made a confirmed appearance in public since July,
when he visited the Asian Games Village. A Japanese newspaper
recently reported that a tourist saw Deng and President Yang
Shangkun eating dinner in a public restaurant, but there was no
official confirmation.
   Since the last sighting of Deng, rumors had circulated that he
was on his deathbed, as happens whenever he is long absent.
   Although Deng retired nearly a year ago from his last official
post, there is fear that his death will leave a power vacuum, with
no single leader strong enough to hold together competing
ideological and regional factions.
   Some Western diplomats, however, say to a certain extent that
has already happened. Deng lost prestige as a result of the
democracy movement in 1989 and its bloody quashing by the army, and
hard-liners reportedly have criticized him directly in
behind-the-scenes debates over China's future course.
   The party leadership has been unable to agree even on a new
economic blueprint for the next five years, suggesting that Deng is
no longer playing policy-maker and power broker as he had since
1978. Chinese sources said the party finally opened a long-delayed
Central Committee meeting on Tuesday to discuss the five-year plan,
but that deep divisions remained.
   Several recent articles in the official media have summed up
Deng's achievements completely in the past tense, as if he no
longer were contributing to the party.
   The television news also showed Premier Li Peng, Communist Party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other top leaders casting their
ballots in Zhongnanhai.
   The election was for delegates to district and county people's
congresses, China's lowest-level representative bodies and the only
offices directly elected by the public.
   The congresses have no legislative power and act mainly as
conduits for citizens' ideas and complaints. But they are the basis
for China's assertion that it has a democratic system. Beijing has
18 such congresses with a total of nearly 17,000 delegates.
   Given China's one-party system, the campaign was a placid
affair, with no debates or candidate advertisements and little
contact between candidates and voters. Nominations are made chiefly
by closed-door committees and candidates must have good ideological
credentials.
   The law permits at most two candidates per seat, but in practice
the ratio is generally lower. In the Zhongnanhai district, for
example, Xinhua said Deng and other voters were to choose two of
three candidates.
   Ballots were to be counted by hand, with results taking several
days to tabulate.

<HEAD>Top Auction Houses Come to Berlin, Hoping For Eastern Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's top auction houses have set up shop in
Berlin, seeking to acquire and sell treasures kept hidden during
Communist rule in eastern Euope.
   Sotheby's, the world's largest art auction house, has chosen a
former Prussian palace in eastern Berlin as the site of its new
office. The previous tenant was the German-Soviet Friendship
Society.
   Rival Christie's has selected a posh ground-floor setting just
off the Kurfuerstendamm, western Berlin's most fashionable shopping
boulevard.
   The arrival of the two major auction houses could signal the
start of a revival of Berlin's prewar role as Germany's major art
center.
   Both aim to explore the art world of the formerly Communist
east, largely closed off to capitalist dealers durin the Cold War.
   ``Sotheby's had long thought about going to Berlin. With the
opening of the Wall, it became necessary to open,'' said H. Josef
Koenig, director of the Berlin office.
   Koenig says he gets offers every day from eastern Germans
seeking appraisals of silver, paintings, or antiques they had
hidden for years.
   The objects include old Meissen porcelain, pieces of Biedermeier
furniture, silver, jewelry and paintings. Sometimes works of real
value appear and can make their owners rich.
   Shortly before unity on Oct. 3, an East German from Dresden
showed up at the Frankfurt branch of Sotheby's with a painting he
had inherited. The retired worker had hidden the painting after the
1945 Red Army invasion and kept it secret from East German
authorities, who had forbidden private ownership of art.
   Experts identified the painting as a portrait by the
20th-century German expressionist Emil Nolde. The work, out of
sight for half a century, had been given up for lost by art
connoisseurs. It was valued at $900,000.
   ``Nobody knows what is over there,'' said Koenig.
   To find out, Christie's hired Peter Betthausen, former director
of the National Gallery in what was East Berlin and a specialist in
German art of the 19th and 20th centuries, to head its office.
   Christie's is also staffing its Berlin office with experts to
assess the value of objects offered, focusing on silver and
jewelry.
   Sotheby's eastern expansion does not stop in Berlin. It already
has an office in Budapest and another is planned for Prague in
1991.
   Berlin was an art center in 1933 when Nazi leader Adolf Hitler
took power. But the Nazis banned many artists, and in 1939 publicly
burned more than 1,000 works they deemed offensive.
   Socialist realism became the predominant style when the
Communists came to power in eastern Berlin after World War II.
Artists who did not conform could not exhibit.
   The unstable postwar political situation also affected West
Berlin. The city found it hard to attract valuable works for
museums while the city was divided.
   Sotheby's sponsored a public exhibition that drew large crowds
in October to see modern paintings by such artists as Kandinsky,
Matisse and Modigliani.
   Christie's flew in former NATO Secretary-General Lord
Carrington, now chairman of Christie's International, for the
official Dec. 10 opening of its Berlin offices.
   However, it may take a while for Berlin to become the site of
the kind of spectacular auctions held regularly in London. Auctions
are most likely to fetch higher prices in London, where the public
is more international than in Berlin.

   Americans connected to U.S. embassies in six
Middle East and two African countries are being ordered home or
permitted to return voluntarily as a result of ``unstable
conditions'' related to the Persian Gulf, the State Department said
today.
   A U.S. official said these conditions have intensified following
the decision of the U.N. Security Council to set a Jan. 15 deadline
for Iraqi troops to withdraw from Kuwait.
   All non-essential personnel and dependents of U.S. government
personnel are being asked to leave Jordan and Sudan ``well before
the Jan. 15 deadline,'' the announcement said. The State Department
also recommended that U.S. citizens defer travel to the two
countries.
   Later, a State Department official said the actions announced
today affect only Jordan and Sudan. The decisions concerning the
other six countries had been announced earlier, the official said.
   There has been strong pro-Iraqi sentiment in Jordan, and King
Hussein has been an outspoken advocate of a negotiated settlement
to the gulf conflict. The Sudanese government, meanwhile, generally
has been supportive of the Iraqi position.
   The statement indicates concern over the possibility that
pro-Iraqi sentiment in the eight countries could be directed at
U.S. diplomatic offices. Large anti-American demonstrations have
taken place in the Sudan and Jordan.
   Following is the list of actions concerning the safety of U.S.
citizens which had been taken previously:
   -Dependents and non-essential personnel are being sent home from
U.S. embassies in Sudan and Yemen.
   -The voluntary departure of U.S. government dependents and
non-essential employees was authorized from Jordan and Mauritania.
   -Voluntary departure also was authorized for U.S. government
dependents in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and the
Eastern province of Saudi Arabia - all gulf states.

   A relentless cold wave that killed people and crops as it
plunged temperatures to record lows all over the country eased in
the West somewhat today, but the relief isn't likely to last.
Another arctic front is on the way.
   A week of bone-numbing temperatures, often accompanied by hail,
sleet, snow or freezing rain, led up to the coldest Christmas on
record for more than 125 U.S. cities on Tuesday, including San
Francisco; Albuquerque, N.M.; Boise, Idaho; Eugene, Ore.; and
Winslow, Ariz.
   Yellowstone, Mont., was the nation's coldest spot at 30 below.
   Temperatures fell to subfreezing levels all over the Lower 48,
including parts of Southern California and Florida. Snow blanketed
most of the Pacific Northwest, Rocky mountains, the Great Plains
and the Appalachians.
   A mass of warm air snapped the bitter cold in some areas of the
Southwest today, but forecasters said not to get used to it.
   ``We're starting to see temperatures moderate a little bit,''
said Ross Dickman, a National Weather Service meteorologist in
California. ``But there's also the possibility, with the new
frontal system moving in, by the end of the weekend we could be
back in below-freezing temperatures.''
   Outside the Southwest, miserable conditions prevailed another
day.
   A freezing rain advisory was in effect for the mountain passes
of Washington state today; more subzero temperatures were forecast
for Idaho, Montana and parts of Nevada; freeze warnings remained in
effect for parts of Arizona; warnings of heavy snow were issued for
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and gale warnings were in effect
across most of the Great Lakes.
   In Arkansas, forecasters feared warm air catching up with
stalled cold air might blend to bring freezing rain.
   The cold left many highways as slick as glass, stranding
countless holiday travelers nationwide.
   ``The entire core area is just like a skating rink,'' state
police Sgt. Aaron Olson said of the highways in Portland, Ore.
   The cold weather also took a toll on air quality in Oregon. Air
in the Eugene-Springfield area was rated unhealthful Tuesday. Wood
smoke was a major source of the problem.
   There have been more than 80 weather-related deaths, including
three Texas boys who plunged through the ice of frozen lakes and
ponds on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
   In Texas and Arizona, citrus growers say their crops dodged the
cold-weather bullet so far, but heavy navel orange losses were
reported in California, where flowers for next week's Rose Parade
floats also withered.
   In central California's Tulare County, where most of the state's
navel orange crop is grown, Agricultural Commissioner Lenord Craft
estimated a $200 million loss to this year's harvest.
   Thousands of people in Northern California's San Lorenzo Valley
area were without water service when many pipes froze and burst.
Others in the drought-stricken area had to run their water
constantly to keep the pipes from freezing.
   ``After all of our conservation because of the drought, it
breaks your heart to see it pouring out of the pipes,'' said local
resident Carol Rice.
   Many people throughout southern Idaho also continued to wait for
plumbers to repair frozen water pipes and for mechanics to fix cars
halted by the gelid conditions.
   The state's ski resorts reported excellent conditions, except
for Idaho's most famous resort. Sun Valley's slopes haven't shared
in the wealth of snow dumped on the state in the past week and
reports only an 18-inch base.

   They're not exactly art treasures, but there
is a certain creativity in the items on display at Carla's Sandwich
Shop just outside the gates of Florida State Prison.
   The collection, confiscated from inmates by many of the shop's
customers, ranges from a felt-tip pen concealing a razor blade to a
Vienna sausage can with a hidden compartment for drugs.
   Carla Hawthorne, owner of the shop and a former correctional
officer, hopes to eventually open a law enforcement museum that
will show people the kinds of things officers deal with.
   ``Inmates run a con game on people - mothers, wives,
grandparents. Then they come down here and really see what's going
on,'' she said. ``They are naughty boys inside.''
   She said visitors to the eatery, which is near three
Jacksonville area prisons, are sometimes surprised by the
contraband that inmates imaginatively fashion from everyday items.
   Among the items on display are a key to a door lock made from a
disposable razor blade and a variety of knives fashioned from
pieces of wood, metal and plastic glass. There also are several
``zip guns,'' in which small metal tubes are fashioned into crude
weapons in which sulfur shavings from match sticks are used to fire
nails or other projectiles.
   But not all inmate creations are deadly. Mrs. Hawthorne also has
on display toaster ovens made from cigarette package foil and light
bulbs.
   And in front of her counter is a still created from a metal box,
plastic buckets and pieces of copper tubing welded together.
   Mrs. Hawthorne said inmates used it to ferment an alcoholic
potion they call ``buck.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the target of
relentless criticism over the economy, suffered a heart attack
after a government reshuffle left his job in doubt. He was said
Wednesday to be out of danger.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, visibly saddened,
delivered the news to the Congress of People's Deputies in a slow,
soft voice.
   ``A very difficult event last night. Nikolai Ivanovich (Ryzhkov)
had a heart attack, a coronary. ... There is no threat to his life.
But that's the situation. We wish him a return to health. We're
very sorry.''
   A spokesman for the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, headed by
Ryzhkov said by telephone that the prime minister was out of danger
and resting in a hospital on Wednesday. Ryzhkov, 61, was under
``constant surveillance'' but no other information was available,
said Yuri I. Tyunkov.
   The deputies reacted with silence to the news, then returned to
their day's agenda on granting Gorbachev more presidential powers.
   The 2,250-member parliament had voted Tuesday to eliminate
Ryzhkov's Council of Ministers and create a new Cabinet under
Gorbachev's control. It was unclear whether Ryzhkov would retain
the post of prime minister in the revamped body.
   Ryzhkov has been accused of delaying radical reforms that some
consider necessary for halting the country's economic crisis.
   Last fall, Rhzykov's conservative economic reform plan was
pitted against a more radical plan pushed by Russian republic
leader Boris Yeltsin. That put Gorbachev in the middle of the
fractious political battle that continues to paralyze the
government.
   ``In his face you could see the imprint of the constant worry
about what was going on in the country and all the things people
were saying about him,'' said Nadezhda A. Kryuchenkova, a deputy
from Tambov. She said she was among Ryzhkov's critics.
   The heart attack ``testifies to the fact that he really took to
heart everything that the country was going through,'' said Air
Force Marshall Alexander N. Yefimov. ``I'm very sorry that he will
not be taking active part in government work for awhile.''
   Yefimov said he believed Ryzhkov would have been the top
candidate for prime minister in the reorganized government, but
that now deputies did not expect Ryzhkov to return to work any time
soon.
   His ouster long had been demanded by reformers, but Gorbachev
stood by his friend.
   Ryzhkov was appointed by Gorbachev in 1985, shortly after
Gorbachev's own ascent as Communist Party chief.
   During his first years as prime minister, Ryzhkov was largely
regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of a
high-profile Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for
victims of the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia.
   During his five-year tenure, Ryzhkov eliminated 25 ministries
and oversaw the dismantling of dozens of other central offices, a
task he has described as ``a battle royal.''
   It was the same bureaucracy he had climbed through to become
prime minister. That job was considered the second-most powerful
before Gorbachev proposed the new structure that would subordinate
executive power to himself.
   Ryzhkov was born on Sept. 28, 1929, to a miner's family. After
graduating from the Urals Polytechnical Institute with a degree in
engineering, he began working in 1950 at the giant Uralmash
machine-building complex in Sverdlovsk, where 20 years later he
became its director-general.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1956 and became active in
politics with his appointment to the Supreme Soviet Commission on
Planning and Budget in 1974. In 1981, he became a full member of
the party's Central Committee.
   In 1985, six weeks after Gorbachev became general secretary,
Ryzhkov was appointed a full member of the Communist Party
Politburo. He was named chairman of the Council of Ministers in
September of that year.

   ``On the whole, I'd rather be in the Bronx,''
says Alan J. Mergel, a lawyer who specializes in personal injury
cases. ``If I'm a plaintiff I'd rather be there than any place in
the world.''
   The Bronx: the borough where justice is tempered with
generosity, at least by juries in civil trials, and especially if
the City of New York is a defendant.
   If they are not actually vehicles for the redistribution of
wealth, Bronx civil trial juries are certainly more liberal than
their counterparts.
   According to a three-year study by The New York Jury Verdict
Reporter, Bronx jury verdicts favor the plaintiff 79 percent of the
time, compared with 39 percent across the city line in Westchester
County and 57 percent nationally. And almost one in five Bronx
personal injury verdicts exceeds $1 million.
   Why are Bronx juries so hard on civil trial defendants, notably
the city, the Transit Authority and any other governmental entity
whose lawyers happen to walk in the courtroom door?
   William Kunstler, the radical defense attorney, says it's
because the Bronx is ``a poor person's county, a third world
county,'' filled with jurors who are skeptical of authority and
eager to help the underdog.
   More than two thirds of the borough's residents are black or
Hispanic. Most are members of the working or lower middle classes,
people who are generally less willing or able to get themselves
excused from jury duty than professionals.
   ``If you're picking a jury, you don't want an accountant,'' says
Mergel. ``Those analytical minds tend to have trouble giving money
away.''
   The Bronx is famous for the runaway jury verdict - one so
generous that deep down not even the plaintiff's lawyer expects it.
   In September, for instance, a jury awarded $9.3 million to a
30-year-old dishwasher who was intoxicated when he fell onto a
subway track and was hit by a train.
   Francisco Marino's lawyer argued that his client should have
been removed from the subway platform after a token clerk noticed
he was drunk. The trial judge ruled the verdict was not supported
by the evidence, and ordered a new trial.
   Transit Authority lawyer Wallace Gossett complains that even if
a judge changes such a verdict, ``people hear about (the jury's
award) and rush into the courtroom with grandiose ideas about what
they can recover.''
   Victor Kovner, the city's lawyer, makes no effort to conceal his
disdain for the plaintiff's paradise. In Queens or Staten Island
many more jurors pay property taxes, he said, and ``realize that
the money comes out of their pockets.''
   Whether or not Bronx jurors are really Robin Hoods is almost
beside the point; lawyers think they are, and that influences how
most suits are settled - out of court.
   Earlier this year Mergel was negotiating a settlement in a
judge's chambers in Westchester County. His client, an elderly
woman who had fallen down a flight of stairs, had been offered
$50,000 by the defendant.
   When Mergel demurred, the judge asked him, ``Do you know where
you are? If you were down there (the Bronx) I wouldn't tell you to
take it.'' So Mergel settled for $50,000; if the stairway had been
in the Bronx, he says, he would have demanded twice as much, and
probably have gotten it.

<TEXT>
   CNN on Wednesday televised live the first of
what it said will be weekly U.S. military briefings for reporters
who are in Saudi Arabia covering Operation Desert Shield.
   The briefings are being held in the Saudi capital Riyadh, said
Cable News Network spokesman Steve Haworth. He said CNN will
provide full or partial live coverage of each week's briefings,
depending on events.
   The network's reports are seen in 100 countries, including Iraq,
whose Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait sparked the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Ground rules forbid the disclosure of exactly where in Riyadh
the U.S. briefings are held.
   But the city also is where the United States and Saudis have set
up a joint military command post to direct operations of their
troops in the event of war with Iraq, which faces a Jan. 15
deadline to leave Kuwait.
   Riyadh is about an hour's flight southwest from the Persian Gulf
city of Dhahran, where many news organizations, including the four
major U.S. television networks, have set up bureaus.
   Reporters seeking to visit U.S. troops in the field must
register in Dhahran with the Joint Information Bureau run by the
Saudis and the U.S military.
   Shortly before Christmas, nearly 360 print and broadcast
journalists from various countries were registered with the bureau.
The bureau said 110 were from CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS.

   An argument between two groups of
teen-agers during an opening-night showing of ``The Godfather Part
III'' erupted in gunfire that killed a teen-ager who was uninvolved
in the dispute, police said.
   Three other people were wounded.
   About 700 people were packed into a suburban Long Island theater
for the 10:25 p.m. showing Tuesday. The shooting broke out about an
hour into the film, causing panicked patrons to run for the exits.
   Two teens and two adults - all described as bystanders - were
caught in the cross-fire. A 15-year-old youth died today at a
hospital where he was being treated for a head wound, police said.
   Nassau County police said spent shells recovered indicated at
least four handguns were used.
   Police found the movie still running when they arrived and they
asked the projectionist to stop the film and turn on the lights,
said Detective Sgt. William Cocks.
   He said at a news conference today that two groups of teens
seated in different parts of the Sunrise Cinema got into an
argument that escalated into a shouting match.
   He said a group of about ten teens split up and moved in front
of and behind the second group of teens. The group which split up
then began shooting, according to Cocks, and gunfire was returned
from the other teens. He said police have yet to find out what the
argument was about.
   A 15-year-old identified as Tremain Hall of New York City was
shot in the head and died this morning, police said.
   A 17-year old boy was shot in the left eye and reported in
stable condition today. A married couple, both 23, was also
wounded, but both were in stable condition.
   Police made no arrests today but were interviewing witnesses.
   Carol Boole, a spokeswoman for Boston-based National Amusements
Inc., which owns the theater, declined to comment today on the
incident.

   Just three weeks before the U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait or face possible attack, an Israeli newspaper said
today that Washington and Baghdad had set a date for talks. The
State Department denied the report.
   The independent daily Maariv, quoting Israeli diplomats in
contact with American officials, said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will likely meet with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Jan.
9.
   But in a speech to Jordanian politicians visiting Baghdad
Tuesday, Saddam didn't appear willing to negotiate his position,
saying he wouldn't leave Kuwait until the ``liberation of
Palestine.'' The United States has refused any linkage between
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the Palestinian question.
   Also today, in the Arabian Sea, helicopter-borne U.S. sailors
fired warning shots and then seized an Iraqi vessel loaded with
sugar and bound for the Iraqi port of Basra, military spokesmen
said. In a fracas aboard the ship, sailors were confronted by Iraqi
crewmen and female peace activists aboard the vessel.
   U.S. officials reported no injuries in the confrontation.
   Naval units of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq are
enforcing a U.N.-ordered trade embargo aimed at forcing Iraq to
relinquish Kuwait.
   As tensions increase in the gulf, the U.S. State Department took
steps today to reduce the number of Americans in the region.
   It asked all non-essential personnel and dependents of U.S.
government workers to leave Jordan and Sudan before the Jan. 15
deadline the United Nations has set for Iraq to withdraw or face
the possibility of war.
   The State Department also recommended that U.S. citizens defer
travel to the two countries, both of whose populations generally
support Iraq.
   The State Department also has said that pro-Iraqi sentiment
could be directed at Americans in Yemen, Mauritania, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and the Eastern province of Saudi
Arabia and therefore has recommended that non-essential personnel
leave those countries as well.
   The Israeli newspaper said senior officials in Washington told
Israeli representatives that Baker would visit Baghdad on Jan. 9,
despite proximity to the United Nation's Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq
to leave Kuwait.
   The newspaper said the date for talks aimed at resolving the
gulf crisis was apparently set amid secret negotiations between the
United States and Iraq.
   A State Department spokeswoman, however, today denied any date
had been set, and an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said he had
no information on such an agreement.
   ``Our embassy in Baghdad is in almost daily contact with the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry. There has been no Iraqi movement on the
question of dates,'' said Sondra McCarty, the State Department
spokeswoman in Washington.
   Saddam has previously offered to receive Baker in Baghdad on
Jan. 12, but the White House has rejected that date as being too
late. It has said any date after Jan. 3 would not give Iraq time to
withdraw by the U.N. deadline.
   Earlier this week, however, it was learned that Iraq had
recalled its ambassadors from Western Europe, the United States and
other nations. There was speculation that Iraq was planning a new
diplomatic initiative.
   Diplomats in the region say Saddam might be willing to make
concessions if he can secure linkage between resolution of the
Persian Gulf crisis and efforts toward establishing Palestinian
self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The United States has rejected linking an Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait to the Palestinian issue.
   But Maariv said a Jan. 9 Baker-Saddam meeting could be linked to
plans by Assistant Secretary of State Dennis Ross to visit Israel
on Jan. 7 to discuss new Middle East peace proposals.
   The State Department appears to be putting together a proposal
for opening peace talks between Israel and Arab countries in tandem
with holding municipal elections in the occupied territories, the
paper said.
   Maariv also reported ``military movement'' along Israel's border
with Jordan, and Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
said Iraq might try to use Jordan as a springboard for action
against Israel.
   An Israeli army spokesman declined comment on the reported
military moves. Iraq has lately escalated threats to attack Israel,
saying missiles would be fired at the Jewish state if war breaks
out in the gulf.
   In his speech Tuesday broadcast on Iraqi state radio, Saddam
again tried to link the Palestinian question with Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   ``Let all the fleets and Israel hear, Palestine comes first and
it must be liberated,'' he said.
   Saddam also reiterated his claim that Kuwait was unjustly
removed from Iraq's rule by British colonial rulers. He challenged
Western powers massing in the Persian Gulf to put the question of
Kuwait's future to an Arab referendum.
   ``Why do they not hold a referendum to see the inclination of
the majority of the Arab people?'' Saddam asked.

   The Massachusetts economy may be
hurting, but it had little impact on the bakery run by the nuns at
St. Scholastica's Priory. The sisters, fulfilling a mandate that
they be self-sufficient, did so well they were forced into a
choice: prayer or profit.
   Prayer won.
   ``We couldn't keep up,'' said Mothr Superior Mary Clare.
``There's a great demand for it, but to keep up, to make a profit
in today's automated world, we'd either have to produce so many
that it would be destructive to our life of prayer or else go
under.''
   The decision of the contemplative Benedictine order was reached
unanimously at a meeting last month, Mother Mary Clare said.
   Just before Christmas, the priory stopped using nine part-time
workers from the community and trimmed 120 stores from its delivery
list, a market that stretched from nearby Worcester to Cambridge,
45 miles to the east.
   Mother Mary Clare won't disclose any financial information, but
the bakery provides the main income for the 20 nuns, who also have
a small publishing enterprise.
   ``Prayer is our main work,'' she said. ``Actually, prayer is
interrupted by our work, not the other way around. Work is fitted
into two free time slots, between 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and
from 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.
   On a recent December day, all was quiet at the bakery, which is
in a green-sided building tucked among the trees lining Petersham's
Main Street. The priory proper consists of two buildings of gray
and brown stone that evokes abbey architecture.
   The bakery was set up five years ago to fulfill the religious
order's requirement of self-sufficiency through manual labor.
   That attention to detail lies behind the success of the priory's
baked goods, Mother Mary Clare said.
   ``The fruitcake orders are overwhelming. They're not ordinary
fruitcakes, they are our own special recipe and they don't have any
of the preservatives,'' she said.
   After a write-up in Yankee Magazine, weekly orders for goods
were topping the thousands, many for area stores and supermarkets.
   But now the priory fills only a few store orders and
concentrates on a mail-order business, a workload the nuns say is
easier to schedule and doesn't require the volume of wholesale.
   ``Many people have been phoning and writing and saying, `Well
I'm glad to hear that we can get it through the catalog,'' Mother
Mary Clare said.
   ``It's not an intrusion on our contemplative life the way the
other is,'' she said.
   The more relaxed pace left nuns feeling relieved, she said. ``We
realized this was the direction God wanted us to take. There was
great peace and unanimity.''

<TEXT>
   In da U.P., dey got a strange way of
talkin', eh? A researcher says he has found the Upper Peninsula's
real core of Yoopanese, the local lingo of cromers (KRO-mers) and
cudighis (KOO-di-ghees).
   Translation: Yoopanese is spoken by Yoopers, inhabitants of the
U.P. Cromers means ``hats''; cudighis are ``sausages.''
   Northern Michigan University researcher Stewart Kingsbury calls
the center of this linguistic mother lode the ``Iron Mountain
Triangle,'' a region from Marquette to Bessemer to Iron Mountain,
including the Keweenaw Peninsula. It isn't really a triangle, but
that's Kingsbury's word for it.
   ``Our dialect area received its heaviest influence from Canadian
English,'' Kingsbury said. ``Torries, as those loyal to the British
king were called, fled into Canada after the Revolutionary War,
carrying their dialect with them.
   ``Then the loggers who came down from Canada carried it into the
Upper Peninsula, so its roots are in a New England dialect.''
   As proof, Kingsbury offers his test words: cost, Foster, dog and
water. People in Massachusetts and the Michigan town Michigamme
probably will pronounce them the same way.
   But underneath the Canadian influence - which punctuates Yooper
talk with plenty of ``eh?,'' - is the mark of immigrations of
Finnish, Cornish and Italian settlers.
   Yoopers use words like ``youse'' and ``dem'' just like people in
the Italian neighborhoods of the Bronx, Kingsbury said.
   As strange as their accent might sound to outsiders, in some
cases Upper Peninsula residents say words the way they should be
said. Most Americans wrongly call a sauna a ``SAW-na'' but Yoopers
know it right: ``SOW-na.''

<HEAD>New Ethics Law Squeezes Federal Workers On Outside Employment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As of Jan. 1, federal workers will lose some
options to make money on the side, and they'll face tighter
restrictions as well on what they can do even if they quit the
government.
   Under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, government workers will not
be allowed to take pay for giving speeches, making other public
appearances or writing articles - even those unrelated to their
jobs.
   Other provisions, also effective Jan. 1, will curtail the
contacts that ex-government officials can have with former
colleagues and with foreign clients.
   The most restrictive rules cover Cabinet-level officials and
other top presidential appointees. They will be barred from
lobbying anyone in the executive branch for a year after leaving
their government jobs.
   Some already have cited the tighter conflict-of-interest
standards as a reason to quit before the new year. And at least one
lawsuit has been filed by federal workers who see the honoraria ban
as an infringement of their right to free speech.
   The increased focus on government ethics was cited by outgoing
drug policy adviser William Bennett when he walked away from a new
job, the Republican national chairmanship, after being advised by
the White House that he should refrain from taking outside income
to avoid any appearance of conflict, even if technically legal.
   ``I think clearly the Bush administration has placed a real
priority on the area of ethics and has said everybody better pay
attention. People are much more cognizant,'' of potential
conflicts, said Don Campbell, spokesman for the Office of
Government Ethics.
   Officials in his office say the most controversy surrounds the
new honoraria ban, affecting all government workers.
   Already proposals are circulating in Congress to relax the rule
somewhat. But in the meantime, it means Internal Revenue Service
worker Jan Adams Grant of Ogden, Utah, will no longer be able to
supplement her salary by writing articles about camping and the
environment for such magazines as Woman's Day and Camping Today.
   Grant joined the National Treasury Employees Union suit seeking
a declaration that the honoraria ban is unconstitutional, insofar
as it applies to activities which bear no connection to government
service.
   The new rules also:
   -Bar former officials who have worked on trade or treaty
negotiations from using their inside information to advise a
client.
   -Bar senior government officials from representing any foreign
government or political party before any government agency, except
Congress, for a year after leaving office.
   -Extend the one-year ban on lobbying by Cabinet-level and high
White House officials to cover not just the department where an
individual worked but the entire executive branch of government.
   -Limit any outside income for high-level, non-career workers to
15 percent of the government's Executive Level salary II, which
will be $125,100 on Jan. 1.
   The Pentagon's top procurement officer, John A. Betti, said he
was resigning effective Dec. 31 so that he would not be covered by
the ethics restrictions. Earlier, NASA lost several key employees
who cited similar grounds for quitting earlier than they had
planned.
   Bennett, in turning down President Bush's request that he head
the Republican National Committee, was unhappy with the rule
barring him from representing the interests of outside employers to
the White House for one year after his departure from the drug
policy post.
   Bennett had a keen interest in making money on the lecture
circuit. According to the Government Ethics Office, Bennett
wouldn't have had a problem if he was just paid to make a speech to
a group. But he would have been prohibited from directly
representing that group's interests to the White House.
   As Republican chairman, Bennett would have been constantly in
touch with the White House over political issues. And that would
present a clear ``appearance'' if not legal problem, according to
White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray. Bennett's brother, Senate
Ethics Committee special counsel Robert Bennett, agreed with that
assessment.
   ``You add it all up and it does not look right,'' Gray said.
   White House personnel director Chase Untermeyer said he gets few
queries from officials or prospective appointees about
post-employment conflicts, despite the new rules.
   ``It may well be that a lot of people, including White House
staffers don't think about the day they have to leave,'' he said.
When that day comes, he said, `` There may be a lot of gulping,''
as they learn what they can and cannot do.

   An intoxicated man falls and is hit by a New York subway. A
pedestrian is struck at a Phoenix intersection with no traffic
signals. An inmate in Illinois is beaten into a coma by another
prisoner.
   All sue the cities for damages and get multimillion-dollar
awards doled out by juries. A judge even gives away City Hall to
settle one case.
   A dozen years ago, cities enjoyed the same broad immunity as
states against such lawsuits. But a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court
decision opened the floodgates.
   The court said cities, their agencies and city officials may be
sued for violating an individual's civil rights. Damages could be
awarded if the violation occurred while a city ordinance or
official policy was being followed.
   Today, some cities pay out millions each year as a result of
damage suits. New York City alone pays out between $150 million and
$200 million. In Los Angeles, $30.8 million was used to cover 1,132
suits filed in fiscal 1989-90.
   ``In general terms, it's a shame because as a nation what we're
doing is suing ourselves into oblivion,'' said Steven Atkins, city
administrator in Iowa City, Iowa. ``Every time we turn around, we
can't take any action without the threat of some kind of
litigation.''
   ``Cities get sued because we're here,'' said Lewis Leigh,
executive director of the Washington Cities Insurance Authority, an
insurance pool for 70 cities in Washington state.
   ``They assume we're good for some part of (damages) just because
we're around. ... The law is fairly consistent in finding fault
with cities. We have to just grin and bear it.''
   Struggling East St. Louis, Ill., lost its City Hall building
when it couldn't pay off a judgment. The city had so little money
that a judge in September awarded City Hall to a man who was
brain-damaged in a beating by another inmate in city jail. He sued
and was awarded $3.4 million. The city is appealing.
   Pat Dennis, an assistant city attorney in Oklahoma City, says
such lawsuits are a growing problem in her city.
   ``Many times they feel that the police used excessive force just
putting handcuffs on them,'' Ms. Dennis said. ``Or they allege the
jail is inadequate or the food is no good. The imagination is the
only thing that is the limit to what kind of suits there are. This
is their revenge.''
   A number of cities queried by The Associated Press said the
number of lawsuits hasn't changed much in recent years.
   ``People are always suing the city,'' said Roderick McDougall,
Phoenix city attorney. ``They have a traffic accident and claim
there was something wrong with the roadway, or they're hit by a car
and claim the crosswalks weren't clearly marked.''
   This year, Phoenix was ordered to pay $6 million in damages for
failing to install traffic signals at an intersection near a high
school. The money went to a paralyzed victim of a traffic accident
at the intersection. Phoenix is appealing the award.
   Philip Shiner, assistant Los Angeles City Attorney, said the
number of lawsuits filed against the city have decreased but the
settlement and verdict amounts are on the increase.
   ``You can have one case in a given year that goes haywire. Or
you can have two cases that skew the statistics,'' Shiner said.
``Inflation and attorney's fees in some cases increase the value of
the case.''
   Charleston, W.Va., City Attorney John Charnock thinks juries
tend to rule against the city in such lawsuits.
   ``I just think they look at the city and say, `They got plenty
of money,''' he said. ``The city is a deep-pocket defendant.''
   ``My own theory is one of anti-government,'' said Albuquerque,
N.M, city attorney David Campbell, who said lawsuits against his
city are increasing at 8 to 10 percent a year.
   ``If you've ever had your dog picked up, if you've ever been
ticketed by the cops, if you've ever had your water service cut off
or a pothole in front of your house for weeks, then you get a
chance to serve on a jury and if the defendant is the city - it's
payback time,'' he said.
   New York City successfully appealed a $9.3 million jury award to
a dishwasher who was intoxicated when he fell onto a subway track
and was hit by a train. He argued that the Transit Authority should
have followed its own rules and removed him from the platform after
a token clerk noticed he was drunk. He also argued the station was
too dimly lit.
   An appeals court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial.
   Wallace Gossett, a Transit Authority lawyer, says judicial
review of jury verdicts saves the day for agencies such as his.
   There's a problem, however: ``People hear about these enormous
verdicts and rush into the courtroom with grandiose ideas about
what they can recover.''

<HEAD>Former Arms Control Adviser: Use Navy, Air Force, Not Army In Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush should use the Navy and Air
Force to get Iraq out of Kuwait, but not U.S. ground forces, a
former top U.S. arms control adviser suggested Wednesday.
   A ground assault on Saddam Hussein's entrenched army in Kuwait
and Iraq could put Saddam at an advantage, Paul H. Nitze wrote in
an opinion piece published in The Washington Post.
   ``The object of strategy in a serious contest is to deny the
opposition any possibility of finding a winning strategy of its
own,'' said Nitze, who was an arms control adviser in the Reagan
administration.
   Nitze wondered why President Bush has committed so many ground
forces in his 400,000-troop commitment against Iraq in Saudi Arabia
and the Gulf.
   ``Why was such a commitment made?'' he wrote. ``Was it because
the U.S. Army, in order to enhance its prestige as being a
necessary part of joint offensive action in the Gulf at a time of
impending budget cuts, did not wish to see the Navy - perhaps
eventually augmented by selective air attack but without active
participation of the Army - progressively squeeze Iraq into full
compliance with the U.N. resolutions?''
   Nitze said that if Iraq were to have ``the enormous advantages
of being dug-in in prepared positions and of being on the
defensive, can (Saddam) not have confidence that they could hold
their own against U.S. and allied forces traversing more than 100
kilometers of desert for the attack?''
   ``In sum,'' Nitze wrote, ``shouldn't the president (Bush) now
capitalize on Saddam's release of the hostages by switching his
tactics to the more certain and prudent approach of giving the Navy
and the Air Force time progressively to squeeze the Iraqi forces to
the point where they would either themselves take offensive action
against wholly unfavorable odds, or better still, where Iraq would
decide to comply with the U.N. resolutions?''

   One seaman aboard this
hospital ship has two things that set him apart from the rest of
the U.S. military: an Iraqi passport and a brother fighting for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The 21-year-old escaped Iraq for the United States during the
middle of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and he has been in the Navy
for two years.
   He is still not sure how his mother arranged his airplane ticket
out in 1984, but guesses it took a large bribe.
   ``A lot of kids were coming home in body bags and my mother
didn't want me to,'' said Wa'el, using only his first name because
his entire family remains in Baghdad.
   His only brother, then 16, had already been drafted. Wa'el is
sure his brother is back in the military, because Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein has mobilized everyone up to age 33 since he invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``I don't know what border he is on. Maybe the border with Iran,
maybe Turkey,'' Wa'el said. ``But most likely Kuwait.''
   He has not talked with his brother in at least eight months, and
the conversations they had before that were always terse because
they were believed tapped. He learned a little during two visits
from his mother.
   The brother said the elite Republican Guard was deployed behind
his regular army unit to make sure it held firm against the
Iranians.
   ``If people wanted to chicken out, they just shot them, if they
tried to retreat,'' Wa'el said.
   While his brother was fighting, Wa'el was living with his
grandmother and uncle in Paramus, N.J. He joined the Navy after
graduating from Paramus High School in June 1988.
   ``I love the culture and the people and felt like I owed
something to the people,'' he said.
   As a child he worshipped Saddam. Wa'el remembers the time he and
his brother hurled themselves out of the house half-dressed when
they heard Saddam was visiting a nearby school.
   They were ecstatic because the Iraqi president kissed his
brother's hair and patted Wa'el on the head.
   ``We thought he was a hero,'' he said.
   That feeling gradually changed as the war with Iran dragged on.
His father's insurance business collapsed, although the well-to-do
family maintained a comfortable life. Neighbors who publicly
denounced the war disappeared.
   Iraq was easy to forget when Wa'el was far away, but memories
are returning now.
   ``Baghdad is a beautiful city,'' he said. ``I miss swimming in
the Tigris River, fishing there.''
   He hopes his family does not know he is in the Persian Gulf. He
told his relatives in the United States if anyone from Iraq got
through on the telephone to tell them he had gone to college and
had yet to get in touch.
   ``My mother would have a heart attack if she knew I was here,''
he said.
   As a medical photo assistant on the hospital ship - one that's
committed to treating anyone brought on board - he will not be
directly involved in fighting his fellow citizens.
   He dreams of American planes bombing his homeland.
   ``I wake up sometimes crying,'' Wa'el said.
   He does not advertise his nationality among his shipmates. But
even those who know treat him normally, Wa'el said. Despite his
military service he has yet to apply for U.S. citizenship, worried
about official reaction to his Iraqi origins.
   ``I'm glad I'm on this side,'' he said. ``They are fighting for
something that's not worth fighting for.''

   Enrollment at the nation's colleges and
universities rose this year, despite a declining number of high
school graduates, according to a survey released Wednesday.
   The survey by the American Council on Education showed the
increase in enrollment for the 1990-91 school year was largest at
two-year community colleges where tuition is lower and many schools
cater to older students.
   Increases in enrollments at community colleges between the fall
of 1989 and this past fall ranged from 2 percent to 6 percent, the
survey said.
   The increase at four-year colleges and universities ranged from
about 1 percent to 3 percent, it said.
   The survey covered both private and public colleges and
universities in 14 states. The sample accounts for about 45 percent
of the total enrollment and can be taken as a general indicator of
national trends, said David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the council.
   Educators have been predicting a decline in higher education
enrollment because of the declining number of 18-year-olds.

   Nancy Cruzan, whose case led to a
landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the right to die, died
peacefully Wednesday, her parents by her side and euthanasia foes
camped outside the hospital.
   The 33-year-old woman's death at the Missouri Rehabilitation
Center came 12 days after a feeding tube implanted in her stomach
nearly eight years ago was removed under court order at her
parents' request.
   The Cruzans had said their daughter, who was left in what
doctors called an irreversible vegetative state from a car
accident, would not want to continue living.
   ``She remained peaceful throughout and showed no sign of
discomfort or distress in any way,'' Joe and Joyce Cruzan said in a
statement.
   ``Knowing Nancy as only a family can, there remains no question
that we made the choice she would want,'' the Cruzans said.
``Nancy, we will always love you and hold your memory in our
hearts.''
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.
   The Cruzans had fought for three years to allow their daughter
to die, and the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In its 5-4 decision in June, the court blocked the Cruzans from
withholding food and water in the absence of ``clear and
convincing'' evidence she would have wanted to die.
   After former co-workers testified they recalled Ms. Cruzan
saying she would never want to live ``like a vegetable,'' a state
judge ruled such evidence existed and gave permission Dec. 14 to
remove the tube.
   A spokesman for the Society For The Right To Die said the
ramifications of the case would be far-reaching.
   ``They (Supreme Court judges) found that there is a
constitutional basis for the right to refuse treatment,'' spokesman
Doron Weber said from New York. ``There is a constitutional basis
for the right to refuse treatment.
   ``We feel that Nancy Cruzan has made legal history. (But) her
dying is an entirely private matter.''
   Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed guardian, attorney Thad McCanse,
had agreed with the family that allowing her to die was in her best
interest.
   ``I'm grateful that the ordeal is over for Nancy and the
family,'' said McCanse. ``I also feel they can be proud that Nancy
has had an impact, so people can make plans about things that are
terrible, things you hope never will happen.''
   But the Rev. Joseph Foreman of Atlanta, a founder of the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, called Ms. Cruzan's death a
tragedy with dangerous implications.
   ``I think in the next few years you will see an entire industry
spring up around putting people to death whom family, friends and
so forth have deemed to be no longer of use to anybody,'' Foreman
said.
   ``There will be wings of hospitals devoted to putting people to
death like this.''
   After the tube was removed, euthanasia opponents went to court
seven times to try to force the state to resume feeding Ms. Cruzan
but were turned back for lack of legal standing.
   Nineteen demonstrators were arrested Dec. 18 when they stormed
the hospital in an attempt to reattach the tube. They were ordered
to appear in court Jan. 3 on charges of trespassing and unlawful
assembly.
   Anti-euthanasia activists had maintained a round-the-clock vigil
outside the hospital since Dec. 14. Ten, who had slept on the
hospital steps Tuesday night, left a few hours after Ms. Cruzan's
death was announced.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage when her car ran off a
road as she drove home from her job at a Carthage cheese plant Jan.
11, 1983. Doctors said her brain was without oxygen for perhaps 20
minutes.
   She was given a feeding tube but was not put on a life-support
system such as a ventilator.
   Ms. Cruzan lingered in a vegetative state - her body rigid, her
feet and hands constricted and bent, her fingernails sometimes
digging into her wrists. Her eyes opened and moved erratically at
times, but doctors said she was as unconscious as someone in a coma
and had no prospects for recovery.
   An estimated 10,000 Americans are in such conditions.
   She suffered from seizures, vomiting, bleeding gums and
diarrhea. Her care at the state-run hospital cost Missouri
taxpayers $112,000 a year.
   Ms. Cruzan's case prompted state and federal right-to-die
legislation.
   It also spurred interest in ``living wills,'' which spell out a
person's wish for treatment, and in using power of attorney to
authorize someone else to make medical decisions if the individual
is unable to do so.
   As of July, at least 41 states and the District of Columbia had
living will laws, which allow individuals to make their wishes
about medical treatment known in advance of a crisis that may
render them unable to speak.
   In November, President Bush signed legislation creating a sort
of medical ``Miranda warning.'' Under the law, effective in
November 1991, patients in Medicare- or Medicaid-supported
hospitals or nursing homes must receive written information
explaining their right-to-die options under their state laws.

   The number of persons killed this year
near a U.S. Border Patrol station has risen to a record 15 after
two people were fatally struck as they tried to circumvent the
checkpoint, authorities said.
   Fourteen were killed last year near the checkpoint, which is on
Interstate 5 about 70 miles north of San Diego.
   Since 1987, at least 65 people, mostly Mexican immigrants, have
been hit by cars as they tried to skirt the checkpoint by crossing
the eight-lane freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. Forty
have died.
   The most recent pedestrian deaths occurred Christmas Eve, the
CHP said. Elva Valdes Lopez, 37, and Del Carmen Valdez Hidalgo, 15,
both from the Mexican state of Michoacan, were struck by a sedan.
   The driver was not injured or cited, authorities said.

<HEAD>Bush to Interrupt Holiday with Day of Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush planned to interrupt his
extended holiday stay at Camp David, Md., to return to the White
House on Thursday for a day of what aides described as routine
paperwork.
   ``He just wanted to come back and be in the office a little
bit,'' White House spokesman Steve Hart said Wednesday.
   He said Bush had no plans for staff consultations, although it
was likely that he would meet with his national security advisor,
Brent Scowcroft, as he does on a daily basis when both are in town.
   Hart also rejected any suggestion that the president was
hurrying back to deal with any pressures relating to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Bush's day was to be ``very routine,'' and he planned to return
to Camp David in the afternoon before an expected storm swept
through the area, Hart said.
   One White House source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Bush was ``bored to tears'' midway through his 12-day stay in the
Maryland countryside.
   The president, a well-known workaholic, has been at the
presidential retreat two hours outside the capital since Friday. He
took the new British prime minister, John Major, with him for talks
on Saturday, and was briefed on the Persian Gulf military situation
by top advisers on Monday.
   Bush otherwise has spent a family holiday, with all of his five
children and 12 grandchildren joining him and first lady Barbara
Bush for Christmas.
   Bush was scheduled to return to Washington on New Year's Day.

   A jobless truck driver who was robbed as
he rescued a motorist from a frigid pond has been inundated with
presents and even job interviews from people who heard the story of
his heroism.
   ``I didn't expect this kind of response,'' said Ameen El-Massri.
   People bearing gifts have found their way to his second-floor
apartment in Waterbury since Christmas morning, the day after a
story detailing his heroism appeared in The Waterbury
Republican-American. The newspaper's switchboard was flooded with
calls from people who wanted to help.
   People brought enough money to cover this month's rent, more
than making up for the $370 stolen from him during the rescue Dec.
17.
   His family also has received more than 30 Christmas cards,
candy, fruit, wine, a ham, three turkeys, and a box of toys for his
three children.
   ``At first I felt like I was robbing people,'' he said,
explaining that he tried to refuse the gifts. ``Then I realized
that people want to give things, they want to help.''
   When El-Massri dove into a frigid pond Dec. 17 to help save a
motorist's life, someone stole his jacket, which he had taken off
before plunging into the water. It contained $370, money from his
last unemployment check.
   El-Massri said he was upset at losing the money, but was even
more troubled because bystanders were so reluctant to help him
during the rescue.
   He said the experience caused him to question the generosity of
others. ``Now I know there are people out there who will help,'' he
said.
   The publicity he has received has helped him set up six job
interviews this week.
   ``I'm going to be pretty busy this week,'' he said.

<HEAD>Americans Ordered to Leave Jordan, Sudan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Wednesday ordered
nearly 300 Americans to leave Jordan and Sudan, well before the
Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Jordan borders Iraq and Israel, and has sided with President
Saddam Hussein at times in his dispute with the United States over
the 4 1/2-month occupation. Sudan's Moslem fundamentalist
government has supported the Iraqi leader as well.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, cited ``unstable
conditions'' for the order. It applies to about 80 Americans in
Jordan and about 200 in Sudan. Some are dependents of U.S.
officials in the two countries and others hold jobs considered
non-essential.
   Boucher said the Jordanian and Sudanese governments were
providing ``effective security'' to Americans and other foreigners.
``We nonetheless believe it prudent in the current circumstances''
to issue the order, he said.
   The order coincided with an extended impasse with Iraq over
President Bush's proposal for high-level talks in Washington and
Baghdad.
   The State Department said there was ``no Iraqi movement'' toward
setting up a visit to Baghdad by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   With the Jan. 15 deadline for an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait
approaching, the two sides refused to budge from their proposed
timetables for Baker to meet with Saddam.
   The debate could soon become academic. Baker has said he would
be willing to fly to Baghdad only between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3, while
Iraq proposed Jan. 12 - and held firm even after Baker rejected the
date as too close to the deadline for the withdrawal of all Iraqi
troops.
   Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, was originally scheduled
to come to Washington Dec. 17, but his meeting with Bush was called
off in light of the dispute over Baker's trip.
   Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, said Baker probably would be in
Baghdad to see Saddam on Jan. 9, but the State Department and the
Israeli embassy said the report was erroneous.
   In Iraq, Joseph Wilson IV, the senior American diplomat at the
U.S. embassy, telephoned Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi deputy foreign
minister, Wednesday and reiterated Baker's proposition.
   ``We've offered 15 dates,'' Boucher said. ``We were forthcoming,
but they have not shown themselves willing to avail themselves of
our offer.''
   Earlier, Sondra McCarty, a State Department spokeswoman, told
reporters: ``There has been no Iraqi movement on the question of
dates.''
   Other U.S. officials said Iraq has held consistently to Jan. 12
in the nearly daily conversations Wilson has held with Hamdoon and
others in the Iraqi foreign ministry.
   And Don Davidson, a White House spokesman, said Jan. 3 would
remain the cutoff for Baker to visit Baghdad.
   Meanwhile, the State Department and the Israeli embassy disputed
the report in Maariv, which quoted unidentified Israeli diplomats,
that Baker probably would go to Baghdad Jan. 9.
   Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in Washington,
said: ``We have no knowledge of anything of the sort.'' She called
the newspaper report ``pure speculation.''
   Baker remained in Houston on vacation. There was no indication
at the State Department, a day after Christmas, of any special
diplomatic activity on the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council last month
indirectly threatens Iraq with military action if its troops do not
depart. The resolution was maneuvered through the council by the
Bush administration.

<HEAD>U.S. Sailors in Fracas With Iraqi Crewmen And Women Peace
Activists</HEAD>

   U.S. Navy sailors trying to search a
sugar-laden Iraqi ship in the Arabian Sea on Wednesday fired
warning shots when crewmen and women peace activists tried to stop
the search.
   The boarding was the most chaotic among the thousands carried
out by the U.S.-led multinational forces enforcing the U.N. trade
embargo imposed to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   No injuries were reported in the 30-minute, predawn fracas in
which British and Australian sailors backed up the helicopter-borne
team from the USS Trenton.
   Crew and passengers tried ``to hold the boarding party members
back and grab their weapons,'' said a U.S. Navy spokesman, Cmdr.
Mark Neuhart. ``They tried to physically block the way to the pilot
house.''
   Lt. Col. Greg Pepin told a military briefing in Saudi Arabia
that the sailors fired pistols in the air as a warning and used
smoke and noise-making grenades to control the crowd aboard the
11,333-ton vessel, the Ibn Khaldoon.
   ``It was more vocal than physical resistance,'' Neuhart said. He
said the presence of the peace activists and some reporters might
have contributed to problems with the boarding, near Masirah
island.
   Pro-Iraqi press reports refer to the Ibn Khaldoon as ``the peace
ship,'' and say it was en route to the Iraqi port of Basra in a
demostration of support for Saddam Hussein and his efforts to solve
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The ship had an Iraqi crew of 40 as well as 240 passengers -
mostly Palestinian and Iraqi women. Baghdad Radio, monitored in
Nicosia, said women aboard were from 10 Arab countries, Italy,
China, the United States and Japan.
   Sailors who searched the freighter found it carried 800 tons of
sugar and other cargo such as rice, cooking oil and milk, all
prohibited under the U.N. trade embargo imposed to force Iraq from
Kuwait.
   The ship was later escorted to a nearby anchorage. Neuhart said
the shipmaster agreed to divert the ship to an unidentified port to
discharge the cargo. He said the passengers could then resume their
voyage to Basra.
   A doctor from the USS Trenton, an amphibious transport dock, was
sent to the Ibn Khaldoon after the shipmaster claimed the boardings
caused two heart attacks and two miscarriages, Neuhart said.
   ``The medical officer found no evidence to support the claims,''
he said. After consultations, the master agreed that there were no
injuries.
   Since the U.N. trade embargo went into effect, the U.S. Navy
alone has challenged 5,888 ships, boarded 714 and diverted 30,
mainly in the Arabian and Red seas. Pepin said that in 10 of the
interceptions, warning shots were fired.
   But ``the scuffling was somewhat unusual,'' he said of
Wednesday's boarding.
   The vessel, which gave its departure point as Aden, Yemen, was
first intercepted by the Australian guided-missile frigate HMS
Sydney early Wednesday but refused repeated requests to stop for a
search.
   The U.S. sailors were the first to board the ship when it did
stop.
   That team was backed up by sea-borne crews from the HMS Sydney,
the USS Oldendorf and USS Fife. A British ministry of defense
spokesman said Royal Marines from the HMS Brazen also descended
onto the bridge of the Iraq vessel from a Lynx helicopter.

<HEAD>Bridge Flap May Burn Bridges With Kentucky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civic leaders are worried the city is burning
its bridges by refusing to pay for one.
   Years of shoring up relations with northern Kentucky communities
could come apart if the city refuses to pay its $10 million share
for a new bridge over the Ohio River, development officials said.
   ``This is foolishness we don't need,'' said John Williams,
president of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce. ``No one
benefits from a fight between the north and south sides of the
river.''
   One repercussion of the bridge debate is renewed sentiment among
some Kentucky leaders to rename the Greater Cincinnati
International Airport, which is in northern Kentucky.
   Four years ago, former Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins
proposed that the airport's name be changed to reflect its
location. Cincinnatians were horrified.
   But the movement is gaining strength again now that the city is
backing out of the bridge project, Williams said.
   ``I've already heard rumblings about it on that side of the Ohio
River,'' he said.
   Irvin Callery, a city commissioner in Covington, Ky., is one of
those doing the rumbling.
   ``I'm prejudiced, but I've always thought its name should be the
Greater Covington Airport,'' he said. ``It only makes sense.''
   The bridge that's at the center of the dispute has been proposed
because studies show that the existing bridges becoming overcrowded
as more people build homes in northern Kentucky and work in
Cincinnati. Roughly 15,000 northern Kentuckians work downtown.
   Standing in the way of the $55.9 million project is the
Cincinnati City Council's refusal to put up the $10 million because
of a tight budget and other development projects that have higher
priority.
   A Jan. 7 deadline has been set for the city to change its mind.
   If the City Council doesn't change its mind, the money set aside
by Ohio and the Federal Highway Administration is likely to be
shifted to a bridge linking Maysville, Ky., and Aberdeen, Ohio,
about 45 miles east of Cincinnati.
   ``We've got the money to build this bridge, but we can't get it
done because Cincinnati has not made a financial commitment,'' said
Doug Alexander, a press aide to Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson.
   Bernard Hurst, director of the Ohio Department of
Transportation, said the state was losing interest in the bridge
project because ``we've been working with the city for more than 1{
years and we've been unable to get the city to agree on a funding
package.''
   If the bridge isn't built, efforts to build up relations with
northern Kentucky could come unraveled, Williams said.
   ``We have worked like heck to build some trust and communication
between both sides of the Ohio River, and now this happens,''
Williams said.

<HEAD>Congressman's PAC To Pay FEC Fine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A political action committee founded by Rep.
Dick Armey, R-Texas, has agreed to pay a $3,000 fine to settle
charges that it violated federal election law, officials said
Wednesday.
   A spokesman for the Federal Election Commission said the PAC
established by Armey accepted an illegal contribution and failed to
file proper and timely election reports in 1988.
   Commission spokesman Fred Eiland said Armey's Policy Innovation
Political Action Committee, or PIPAC, agreed on Oct. 2 to pay a
$3,000 civil penalty. The six-member commission approved the
agreement Dec. 20.
   Armey founded PIPAC to help elect like-minded conservatives to
the House. It contributed $21,500 to 30 candidates this year; 12
were elected.
   Armey's spokesman, Ed Gillespie, described the violations as
``just basically technical errors.''
   ``These were charges made by Armey's political opponent,'' John
Wayne Caton, Gillespie said Wednesday. ``The fact is that more
serious charges ... were proven to be false and were dropped.''
   The FEC, however, said it initiated the complaint against PIPAC.
   The settlement agreement covers a variety of complaints, ranging
from failure to file reports on time to accepting an excess
contribution.
   Eiland said the committee accepted three contributions of $2,000
each in 1988 from James Lightner, the retired chairman of
Electrospace Systems Inc. of Richardson, Texas, a defense firm now
owned by Chrysler Corp. The limit on contributions from an
individual to a PAC is $5,000 a year.
   Eiland said the PAC received the $2,000 contributions from
Lightner in February, June and September, but disclosed in an
October report that Lightner's total contributions for the year
totaled just $5,000.
   Gillespie, however, said the excess contribution should have
been attributed to Lightner's wife, Ida.
   Eiland said the PAC was also 110 days late in filing one
election report and 11 days late in filing another.

   Three Jewish radicals were freed Wednesday
after serving less than seven years for killing three Arabs and
maiming two Palestinian mayors in car bombings. They were greeted
as heroes by fellow Jewish settlers.
   The three, members of the Jewish Underground that carried out
attacks in the West Bank in the early 1980s, had their original
life sentences reduced three times by Israeli President Chaim
Herzog. They were released on good behavior.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and killed a
Palestinian after he stabbed three soldiers on patrol in the Shati
refugee camp, the army said.
   Doctors at Gaza's Shifa hospital said the Palestinian was shot
more than 30 times. Palestinian reports identified him as Ala
Abdul-Latif Obeid, 30, from Shati.
   The army reported two of the stabbing victims were in moderate
condition and the third was slightly injured.
   Brig. Gen. Shmuel Zucker, division commander in the Gaza Strip,
noted that the attack followed a rash of stabbings that have been
``grabbing headlines.''
   ``Everyone who intends to hurt an army patrol tries to do this
with a knife when he can't get a gun,'' he told army radio.
   The death brought to 780 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians during the 3-year-old uprising
against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 322 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of helping Israel. Fifty-seven Israelis also died in
the violence.
   Dozens of West Bank settlers danced and chanted outside
Maasiyahu Prison in the central Israeli town of Ramle as the three
former members of the underground - Menahem Livni, Shaul Nir and
Uzi Sharbav - were released.
   Members of the crowd hoisted the three men on their shoulders,
and Noam Arnon of the Gush Emunim settler movement praised them for
their love of Israel.
   ``They are heroes because they decided to sacrifice themselves,
their future, their families, for the security of Jews,'' he said
on Israel radio.
   Tiran Pollock, a leader of the anti-Arab Kach movement, said on
army radio that the underground created a spirit taken up by other
Israelis. ``You see it on the streets ... you see it more and more.
The underground has only begun,'' he said.
   About a dozen Israeli liberals held a counter-demonstration to
protest that the early release of the men would encourage attacks
on Arabs.
   ``This is a message of contempt for human life, of making a
difference between one type of life and another, and it violates
the basic tenet of equality before the law,'' said Yitzhak Zamir, a
former attorney general.
   Left-wing legislator Yossi Sarid also condemned the early
release.
   ``What I conclude from this is that in order to be a murderer
and then to go home peacefully after a very short time ... the most
important thing is that you kill an Arab ... and in this way you
turn a lawful government into a joke,'' Sarid said on Israel
television.
   The three settlers were the last of 27 members of the Jewish
Underground to be freed from prison.
   The group carried out car bombings that blew the limbs off two
West Bank mayors, Bassam Shaka of Nablus and Karim Halaf of
Ramallah, and a grenade and gun attack that killed three students
and wounded 30 others at Hebron's Islamic College.
   Failed attempts to bomb five Arab buses and blow up the Dome of
the Rock, one of Islam's holiest monuments, were also blamed on the
group.
   Livni, the leader of the group, was asked by Israel radio
Wednesday if he was sorry for his actions.
   ``The use of the word regret in this case is childish,'' he
replied. He said he acted because of the government's failure to
combat Arab terror.
   Herzog reduced the sentences of the three men to 24 years, then
15, then 10. After announcing the last reduction in 1989, the
president's spokesman said Herzog was ``convinced that the three
had expressed unambiguous and honest regrets.''
   Two weeks ago, a parole committee cut the terms by another third
for good behavior. In Israel, a life sentence usually means the
inmate must serve at least 20 years.
   Livni was convicted of masterminding the car bombings, and Nir
and Sharbav were found guilty of the Hebron attack. They were
arrested in April 1984 and convicted in July 1985.
   Shaka, who is wheelchair-bound after losing his legs in the
explosion, said Wednesday that the early release was part of
Israeli government policy to ``encourage extremists to act against
Palestinians.''

   Director Alan Parker says he tried hard to
capture the feelings and experiences of Japanese-Americans in his
film ``Come See the Paradise,'' about interracial love and Japanese
detention during World War II.
   Dennis Quaid stars as a union organizer who falls in love with a
19-year-old Japanese-American woman portrayed by Tamlyn Tomita. The
movie deals with their relationship and with the internment of
Japanese-Americans in a desert camp.
   ``It's important that you see I didn't cheat. I might not get it
right, as you might not with any film, but from the point of view
where my heart is, you can't help but see that my heart is with
that family. Not a day went by that I didn't agonize that I got it
right,'' Parker said in a recent interview.
   Parker, 46, whose films also include ``Midnight Express'' and
``Angel Heart,'' was criticized for ``Mississippi Burning'' for
what was described as revisionist myth-making. The movie got seven
Oscar nominations, however.
   ``When you go through an experience like `Mississippi Burning'
and the aftermath and the controversy, it would be very foolish of
me not to become more sensitive to what I'm doing and what it means
to people,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Esther Rolle didn't mind taking time out of
her busy schedule to film a movie for no pay.
   The actress donated her time to make ``Blackbird Fly,'' a
28-minute drama about adolescent sexual abuse that will be
broadcast in February.
   ``It was my feeling that if I don't do it, who will?'' said Miss
Rolle, who appeared in ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and whose television
credits include the situation comedy ``Good Times.''
   Miss Rolle had to work a seven-day week to work on ``Blackbird
Fly'' and keep up with her regular workweek on ``Driving Miss
Daisy.''
   ``I enjoy doing anything I can that might help,'' Miss Rolle
said in a recent interview. ``I hope it does the children some
good.''
   The film is scheduled to be broadcast Feb. 27 on the Learning
Channel and is being screened for Academy Award consideration in
the short-film category.
   Whoopi Goldberg, who starred in the film ``Ghosts,'' and Rain
Pryor, who appears on ABC's ``Head of the Class,'' also appeared in
``Blackbird Fly'' without pay.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Jackie Mason is picking up the ball to
make sure that a New Year's Eve show can go on.
   The annual ball dropping ceremony in Times Square was threatened
with cancellation when a sponsor backed out, but then Mason chipped
in.
   ``It's symbolic of New York, it's symbolic of what makes New
York the tourist mecca of the world, the attraction of the world,''
Mason said Wednesday of the ceremony that is televised nationally.
   The ball - in recent years a big apple - drops from 1 Times
Square. The building's owner, Steve Israel, said this year's
sponsor backed out at the last minute because of the economy. He
did not identify the sponsor.
   The event normally costs $50,000 to $100,000, and Mason is
guaranteeing $10,000, said Israel, who is seeking other sponsors.
   Mason said the ball will be red, white and blue and dedicated to
the troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I always say New York without the bouncing ball is like a city
without delicatessens,'' Mason said. ``It's as if you wiped out
pastrami - there would be nothing to live for.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Actor David Birney and televison personality
Eleanor Mondale are slated for a new poll show that the program's
backers say will ``capture America's pulse.''
   ``The Great American TV Poll,'' beginning March 4 on Lifetime
Television will do polls on any and everything to let Americans
know what they're thinking. Subjects will range from how old is too
old for a miniskirt to would you tell your best friend if you knew
he or she had a cheating spouse.
   Birney starred in the television series ``Serpico'' and
``Bridget Loves Bernie.'' Mondale, the daughter of former
Vice-President Walter Mondale, was a reporter for a Los Angeles
television station and host of a show in Minneapolis.

   Sales of existing homes showed a modest 3
percent increase in November, a real estate trade group said
Wednesday. Some analysts took the report as a possible harbinger of
better days ahead for the slumping housing industry.
   The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
single-family homes last month posted their first increase since a
5.1 percent advance in August.
   Sales had fallen 9.4 percent in September and 3.8 percent in
October, pushing the annual sales rate to its lowest level in
almost six years.
   The 3 percent November rise lifted sales to an annual rate of
3.14 million units, still 12 percent below where they were a year
ago.
   Some analysts, however, said they believed the November increase
could at least mark the end of a two-year slide in housing although
they cautioned against looking for much of a rebound before spring.
   ``Although the worst is probably over for the housing sector, it
is going to be a long bottom,'' said David Wyss, an economist with
DRI-McGraw Hill Inc. ``Mortgage rates have not come down that much
and with home prices still declining, people are afraid to buy.''
   Wyss said that he expected to see housing sales begin to rebound
in the spring, helped out by the aggressive credit easing being
conducted by the Federal Reserve.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said a rebound
in the depressed housing industry will be critical if the country
is to avoid a lengthy recession since there is little prospect that
other segments of the economy will be showing much strength.
   ``Home sales and housing construction have really been in a
recession for two years now. Housing is traditionally the first
sector into a downturn and the first sector out and we think that
will occur this time as well,'' he said.
   Analysts credited the slight improvement in November to
continued declines in mortgage rates. Rates on 30-year fixed
mortgages which have fallen to the lowest levels in three years now
stand at 9.64 percent.
   Harley E. Rouda, president of the Realtors group, said he
believed that consumers had been scared away from potential
purchases in August and September because of the turmoil in
financial markets following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Once mortgage rates settled down, consumers felt more at ease
about buying a home,'' Rouda said.
   The median price for a home in November was $91,300, down 1.7
percent from the mid-point level in October and down 1.9 percent
from the median price a year ago.
   The November sales increase was led by strength in the South and
West. Sales in the South jumped 7.3 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million units although this was still
5 percent below the sales pace set in November 1989.
   Sales rose 2 percent in the West to an annual rate of 500,000
units.
   Sales continued to slump in the Northeast, falling 2 percent in
November to an annual rate of 490,000 units, down 17 percent from a
year ago.
   Sales in the Midwest were unchanged in November from the October
sales rate of 820,000 units.

   Garry Kasparov of the Soviet Union retained
his title as world chess champion on Wednesday with a draw in the
22nd game, staving off a challenge from fellow Soviet Anatoly
Karpov.
   The two ended the 22nd game of their chess championship series
in a draw after the 43rd move. The half-point each player received
put Kasparov ahead in the scheduled 24-game series, 12-10.
   The 27-year-old Kasparov needed a 12-12 tie in the series to
retain the title.
   Despite Kasparov's clinching a tie in the series, the two rivals
must continue playing to see who wins the majority of the $3
million purse. If there is a draw after 24 games, the purse will be
split.
   Kasparov won the title from Karpov in 1985 and defended it in
1986 and 1987. Karpov took the championship in 1975 when American
Bobby Fischer refused to defend the title he won in 1972.
   Kasparov, playing white, arrived promptly at the 5 p.m. (11 a.m.
EDT) starting time at the Palais des Congres, fidgeted with his
pieces awaiting the arrival of Karpov, then made his first move,
advancing his king's pawn, before his rival entered.
   Karpov, 10 minutes late, made an identical first move.
   The game had been delayed by a week. Karpov had called a timeout
last Saturday, then the organizers called a technical timeout on
Christmas Eve, twice postponing the game.
   The series began in New York in October.
   Kasparov had won the last three times he has had white in the
nine games in Lyon.
   Karpov had only won twice in the 21 previous games of this
series.
   The two Soviet grandmasters have had six draws in the French
portion of the championship. They drew 10 times in the 12 games
played in New York between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7.

   An Air National Guard sergeant elected last
month to the state Legislature was sworn in Wednesday, two weeks
early, so he could report for duty in the Persian Gulf.
   Distance will be no object to doing his elected duty, says Rep.
Stephen L. Nass. The 38-year-old Republican from Whitewater
promised to conduct his legislative affairs from overseas by
telephone and facsimile machine.
   Taking the oath of office, Nass promised to serve his country as
well as his constituents to the best of his ability during his
stint in the Middle East.
   Nass is off to the Persian Gulf on Friday with the 128th Air
National Guard Refueling Group.
   ``I knew going in that neither of these jobs was always going to
provide convenience, but if you believe in what you're doing,
convenience is less important,'' said Nass, an 18-year Air Guard
veteran.
   The rest of Wisconsin's lawmakers will take their oaths on Jan.
7.
   In the National Guard, Nass maintains and repairs hydraulic
systems on KC-135 tankers used to refuel planes in flight.
   Nass has been told to plan for three to six months of duty in
the Persian Gulf.

   An argument between two groups of
teen-agers during an opening-night showing of ``The Godfather Part
III'' erupted in gunfire that killed a teen-ager caught in the
cross-fire, police said.
   Panicked patrons scrambled for the exits Tuesday night when the
shooting broke out about an hour into the film. The theater in
suburban Long Island had a full house of about 700 people for the
10:25 p.m. show.
   Two teens and two adults - all bystanders - were caught in the
line of fire and wounded, police said. A 15-year-old male died
Wednesday while undergoing surgery for a head wound.
   Spent shells that were recovered indicated at least four
handguns were fired, said Nassau County police, who have made no
arrests.
   Police who arrived at the 14-screen Sunrise Cinema complex found
the movie still running and had to ask the projectionist to stop
the film and turn on the lights, said homicide Detective Sgt.
William Cocks.
   He said at a news conference Wednesday that two groups of teens
seated in different parts of the theater got into an argument that
escalated into a shouting match. The subject of the argument was
not immediately known.
   A group of about 10 teen-agers split up and moved in front of
and behind the second group of teens, he said.
   The group that split up then began shooting, and gunfire was
returned from the others, Cocks said.
   Tremain Hall, 15, of New York City, was shot in the head and
died, police said.
   A 17-year old boy was shot in the left eye and reported in
stable condition after undergoing surgery. A married couple, both
23, was also wounded; both were in stable condition.
   Carol Boole, a spokeswoman for Boston-based National Amusements
Inc., which owns the theater, had no comment on the shooting. The
company owns about 80 other movie houses across the country, she
said.
   Brian Stockton, the theater manager, said security at the
theater complex was increased during the holiday season to handle
the larger crowds.

<HEAD>Former Deputy Solicitor General to Argue Iran-Contra Appeals</HEAD>

   Former Deputy Solicitor General Andrew L. Frey
will handle appeals for the office of Iran-Contra independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, the office announced Wednesday.
   He will be responsible for arguing against the appeal by former
National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and for continuing the
appellate proceedings against former NSC aide Oliver L. North.
   Frey, 52, was deputy solicitor general from 1973 to 1986 and
gained public attention for successfully appealing the convictions
against Lyn Nofziger, the one-time political director for former
President Reagan.
   Poindexter is appealing his five convictions of April 7 - one
count of conspiring to obstruct inquiries and proceedings, two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of false statements.
   North was convicted May 4 of three counts - altering and
destroying official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and
aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. But those
convictions were vacated by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia on July 20. One conviction
was reversed outright, while the others were simply vacated for
further proceedings. A petition by the prosecutor for a rehearing
of the appeal by the full court was denied.
   Walsh's office has not yet decided whether to petition the
Supreme Court to overturn the appellate panel's decision, but such
a petition would be due near the end of February, Frey said.
   Frey is a partner in the Washington office of the Chicago-based
law firm Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt.
   Nofziger was convicted in February 1988 on three felony counts
of illegally lobbying former White House colleagues within a year
of resigning as Reagan's political director in early 1982. Those
charges were brought by independent counsel James C. McKay.
   Frey argued the appeal in November 1988, and the appeals court
overturned the Nofziger convictions in June 1989. McKay decided
last December to drop the case after the Supreme Court refused to
reinstate the conviction.
   Frey will not join Walsh's office on a full-time basis but will
be paid per diem.
   He will replace Gerard Lynch, a former Columbia University law
professor who became chief of the criminal division of the U.S.
attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.
   Charles Rothfeld, a former assistant to the solicitor general
and now a lawyer with Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, will be assisting Frey.

passersby, injuring nine people, authorities said.
   Six people were in serious but stable condition and the others
sustained minor injuries, said Charles DeGaetano, a spokesman for
the Emergency Medical Services.
   The bus plowed through a couple of public telephones before
hitting the one-story scaffolding in front of the landmark Chanin
Building on East 42nd Street, said Lt. Jim Powell, a Fire
Department spokesman.
   The driver was among those injured, said Caren Gardner, a

   Authorities were investigating and offered no immediate cause of
the bus going out of control.

<HEAD>Former King Deported Hours After Return From 43 Years In Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Michael, Romania's former monarch, returned
to exile in Switzerland Wednesday after being expelled by the
Bucharest government less than 12 hours after he arrived in his
homeland on his first visit in 43 years.
   The 69-year-old former king returned to Romania one year after
the execution of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a popular
revolution. The Communist takeover in 1947 forced the monarch into
exile.
   The Bucharest government called Michael's brief visit a ``cheap
sensation.'' Government spokesman Bogdan Baltazar said in a
statement that Michael's presence in Romania was ``totally
illegal.''
   The Romanian government, facing mounting strikes and protests by
an opposition that accuses it of being a Communist regime in
disguise, apparently had feared the visit by Michael might stir up
unrest. It threw him out on grounds he had not secured permission
to visit.
   In Bucharest Wednesday, about 300 protesters marched up the main
boulevard shouting, ``King Michael, King Michael.'' The opposition
Civic Alliance called for a referendum on restoring Romania's
former constitutional monarchy.
   The statement also urged parliament to condemn the expulsion and
invite Michael back.
   Sorin Botez, vice president of the opposition National Liberal
Party, protested the expulsion, saying: ``His majesty the king is a
Romanian and has been the first and perhaps the greatest victim of
Communism.''
   After Ceausescu was overthrown, the former king had said he was
ready to return from exile as head of a constitutional monarchy
``if my people want me to come back.''
   The National Salvation Front, which took power during last
year's revolution in Romania and won subsequent elections, had
refused to grant him a visa, however.
   In June, the former king accused the Front of leading the
country back toward Communist dictatorship.
   Before being put on a Romanian-chartered flight to Switzerland
Wednesday morning, Michael termed his expulsion ``a rather sorry
state of affairs.''
   The plane carrying the former monarch and a small entourage
later landed at Zurich airport, airport officials said. The king
was traveling by connecting flight to Geneva, where he lives.
   Michael had arrived in Bucharest late Tuesday on his private
plane from Switzerland.
   He was accompanied by his wife, Ana de Bourbon-Parme; his
daughter, Sophie; and several journalists and aides. They were met
by another daughter, Margarita, who was already in Romania on a
visit.
   They were stopped by police and escorted back to the airport.
   The former king, who is of the house of
Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, ruled Romania twice for short periods. He
first succeeded his grandfather, Ferdinand, in 1927 as Michael I,
after his father, Carol, left the country.
   After returning in 1930, Carol acceded to the throne and ruled
for 10 years. Michael was then crowned again and reigned until he
was forced to abdicate when the Communists took power in 1947. He
later declared the abdication invalid.
   During World War II, he ruled briefly under Gen. Ion Antonescu,
who was allied with the Axis led by Nazi Germany. Michael is seen
as important in the 1944 coup that removed Antonescu, allowing
Romania to change sides and support the Allies.

   Umberto Tirelli, a costume-maker for movies such as
``Amadeus'' and ``Once Upon a Time in America,'' died Wednesday,
the Italian news agency ANSA reported. He was 62.
   Cause of death was not given for Tirelli, born in Gualtieri in
the Reggio Emilia region in 1928. He worked as an errand-boy in a
fabric shop in Milan before going into the costume business.
   Tirelli's work on ``Amadeus'' won recognition when the film won
the Oscar for best costumes. He also made costumes for the movie
``The Name of the Rose'' and operas, including Luchino Visconti's
production of ``Norma'' with Maria Callas.
   Tirelli first worked for the Safa workshop, then founded his own
shop in 1964. It developed a reputation for quality and creativity.
   Tirelli also developed an outstanding collection of costumes
from the 18th to the 20th centuries.
   The costume-maker's work was exhibited at the Louvre in Paris in
1988 and was also shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art
and the Kyoto Museum in Japan.
   The funeral was scheduled for Friday in Rome.

<HEAD>Christians Rally Against New Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Christian warlord said
Wednesday that Lebanon's newly formed government is incapable of
ending Lebanon's civil war because of its strong tilt toward Syria.
   ``The makeup of the government does not insure the minimum
degree of an independent authority. We shall not abandon our right
to free, sovereign decision making,'' rightist warlord Samir Geagea
told a news conference.
   The commander of the mainly Maronite Catholic Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main militia, also appealed for urgent Arab League
intervention to rescue a peace plan it brokered to reconcile
Lebanon's warring factions.
   ``This is an imbalanced government which cannot possibly
reconcile the main antagonists of the civil war,'' Geagea said.
``Non-Lebanese considerations and interests are dominant in the new
Cabinet.''
   Geagea and George Saadeh, leader of the Phalange Party, the
Maronites' mainstream political force, have rejected the posts
assigned to them in Prime Minister Omar Karami's new Cabinet.
   The 1 million Maronites make up the nation's largest Christian
sect and have dominated in Lebanon since it gained independence
from France in 1943.
   At least two other Christians on Wednesday refused their posts
in the new Cabinet of 30 warlords and politicians that was formed
Monday to oversee a Moslem-Christian national reconciliation.
   Michel Sassin, a Greek Orthodox named minister of labor, said he
would take up his post only if Geagea and Saadeh join the
government. Nadim Salem, a Catholic who was appointed minister of
public works, also said he would not join the government unless
Phalangists and the Lebanese Forces end their boycott.
   Geagea and Saadeh have said the dominant representation of
pro-Syrian factions in the new Cabinet implies it has been dictated
by Syria. Both called it a ``fait accompli government.''
   Syria is Lebanon's main power broker. It has 40,000 troops
stationed in northern, eastern and central Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   But the Arab League last year sponsored a special session of the
Lebanese Parliament in the Saudi town of Taif that approved a peace
plan based on Moslem-Christian equal power-sharing.
   The plan also calls for the disbanding of Lebanon's militias by
March 21 and for the Syrian army to gradually withdraw from Beirut
and major towns over the next two years and redeploy in east
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
   Geagea and Saadeh contend they represent the major Christian
fighting forces and that no national reconciliation is possible
without their participation as the main Christian negotiators.
   President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite, and Karami, a Sunni Moslem,
have tried both directly and through intermediaries to persuade
Geagea and Saadeh to join the new government.
   Karami has to present his Cabinet to Parliament next week to
seek a vote of confidence.
   Seven Christian and Moslem warlords have been appointed state
ministers without portfolios in the new Cabinet to gain their
approval of a plan to disarm and disband their militias.
   Geagea's 6,000-member Lebanese Forces control more than 70
percent of Lebanon's Christian heartland north and northeast of
Beirut.

<HEAD>U.S. Believes Saddam May Attack Israel if War Seems Inevitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States believes Saddam
Hussein may attack Israel and try to break the international
coalition of forces arrayed against him if he fears war is
inevitable, a U.S. military intelligence expert said Wednesday.
   The Iraqi president is showing no sign of withdrawing from
Kuwait and it looks increasingly likely that hundreds of thousands
of Iraq's troops will have to be forced from the emirate, said Air
Force Lt. Col. Tom Coury, a member of the U.S. Central Command
intelligence staff.
   He warned that Iraq, which has the most extensive chemical
arsenal in the Third World, would likely use such weapons ``against
attacking coalition forces.''
   Coury was one of three speakers at the first regular weekly news
briefing by the U.S. Central Command, held in a hotel ballroom in
the Saudi Arabian capital and broadcast live by CNN-TV.
   The military deliberately chose 6 p.m. for the briefing to avoid
any comparison with the daily 5 p.m. briefing during the Vietnam
War, dubbed ``5 O'clock Follies'' by reporters. If hostilities
break out in the Persian Gulf there will also be daily briefings.
   With the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait
only three weeks away, Coury said, ``We see absolutely no
indication that Saddam Hussein intends to withdraw from Kuwait.''
   He said a key indicator that Saddam intends to stay in Kuwait
for ``the long haul'' is the ``tremendous resources'' he is
spending to fortify the small oil-rich nation at a time when Iraq
is being subjected to U.N. economic sanctions.
   Lt. Col. Greg Pepin, an Army artillery officer selected as the
regular military briefer, said Iraq is estimated to be losing $100
million in revenue a day, or $3 billion monthly.
   Coury said ``for the immediate future we think he (Saddam) will
attempt to avoid conflict while working to erode both U.S. public
support and allied cooperation.
   ``As a last resort, if he fears war is inevitable, he could
initiate open conflict which may include a provocation with Israel
and an attemt to decouple the coalition forces,'' he said.
   Asked whether he believed it was realistic for Iraq to attack
Israel, Coury said: ``I think it is very realistic.''
   Israel has kept an uncharacteristically low profile since the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to keep from upsetting the fragile
coalition of Western and Islamic forces confronting Saddam.
   Coury said Saddam ``continues to pour both men and materials
into the country and along his flank to the west.''
   The Iraqi leader is constructing massive defenses in Kuwait
including trenches, minefields, barriers and hundreds of miles of
barbed-wire fences, he said.
   Iraq now has over a half-million troops, thousands of tanks,
2,500 armored personnel carriers and 2,700 artillery pieces in
Kuwait and southern Iraq, Coury said.
   He said Iraqi troops in Kuwait ``are being adequately supplied''
though he would not elaborate.
   On the fighting quality of the Iraqis, he said, ``The ground
fortifications are formidable but they more of World War I vintage,
and we'll be looking at a technologically superior force going
after that sort of defenses.''
   The Republican Guards, who were in the vanguard of the invasing
troops, are the ``most capable forces,'' he said.
   ``Exactly how the remainder of the army would react under
combat, under invasion of their own country, it's difficult to
say,'' he said.
   Iraq has thinned out its ground forces along the Iranian border
to reinforce defenses in Kuwait, Coury said. Along the Turkish
border, Iraq has mainly infantry with some heavy units.
   ``Overall, (Iraq) flight activity has generally increased with a
definite increase in fighter training and operation,'' he said.
   But although Iraq has the largest air force in the Middle East,
with over 700 combat aircraft, Coury said ``they are no match for
the combined strength of coalition airpower.''
   Maj. Gen. Dane Starling, Central Command's director of
logistics, said Saddam still has time to withdraw everything from
Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline.

   Carlo Francovich, a leader of
anti-Fascist partisans in Florence during World War II and a
prominent historian of Italian unification, died Wednesday. He was
80.
   Francovich was considered a top expert on Italy's unification in
the 1860s, and taught the subject at universities in Siena and
Florence. He wrote a two-volume history of the anti-Fascist
resistance in Florence, where he took part in the 1944 uprising.
   The president of the Italian Senate, Giovanni Spadolini, said in
a message of condolence to Francovich's family that the historian
had ``studied in depth the themes of the formation of democratic,
secular Italy'' and had been ``an authoritative and original
voice.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities on Wednesday were seeking a
motive for two high-powered explosions that knocked out power at an
electrical substation and at a hotel-casino just outside this
gaming resort city.
   They also were trying to determine whether the two Saturday
night blasts, caused by dynamite or some kind of high explosive,
were related to the detonation of a smoke bomb at the same
hotel-casino a short time later.
   ``There were two separate explosions and we believe they could
have been related,'' said Sig Celaya, resident agent-in-charge of
the Las Vegas office of the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   No injuries were reported in the explosions, which caused an
estimated $650,000 damage and left 3,000 Nevada Power Co. customers
without electricity for several hours. Authorities said they had no
suspects and no arrests had been made.
   The first blast destroyed a Nevada Power Co. substation at Jean,
about 30 miles southwest of Las Vegas. Damage was estimated at
$400,000.
   A second blast a short time later destroyed an emergency
generator at the nearby Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino and blew
out windows on one side of the complex, causing an estimated
$250,000 in damages. Guests were transferred to other hotels.
   The explosions were similar in size and detonation, Celaya said
Wednesday.
   A man in the casino set off a smoke grenade after the second
explosion, said Celaya. ``We don't want to speculate on the
situation,'' he said.
   ``We don't know if the smoke grenade was related to the two
bombings,'' Celaya said. ``It could have been anything from using
the grenade to provide light, to a robbery situation.''
   No robbery demands were made and no robbery took place, he said.
   Las Vegas Metro Police and Clark County Fire Department
investigators joined the ATF in searching for clues.
   Evidence from the blast sites was sent to the ATF's laboratory
in San Francisco, Celaya said.
   Nevada Landing reopened this week. A company spokeswoman
declined to comment on the explosion and smoke bomb, except to say
that the hotel-casino had received no threats.

   More than 250 pigs were killed by a fire
that swept through a barn when sparks from farm machinery ignited
hay, authorities said.
   About 300 pigs escaped the blaze, which destroyed the barn on
the Westmoreland County farm of Adam and Mary Lou Skokut. The fire
broke out Monday afternoon and spread quickly.
   ``It just exploded,'' Skokut said. ``It went fast.''
   Skokut said his son-in-law Gary Cunningham was working alone in
the barn when the fire started and had to run a considerable
distance to call for help. The barn was destroyed.
   Cunningham was operating a skid loader, a fork-lift used to
clean hog pens, when sparks from the machine ignited hay in the
barn. The flames spread so quickly that Cunningham did not have
time to pull the vehicle out of the barm, Skokut said.
   Neighbors helped round up the surviving pigs, which are being
kept temporarily in a silo.

<TEXT>
   A lawsuit accusing special prosecutor Lawrence
Walsh of trying to stifle an insider book about the Iran-Contra
investigation will stay in New York, a federal judge ruled
Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of Manhattan turned down a
request by Walsh to have grand jury secrecy issues decided by the
judge in Washington who supervised the Iran-Contra grand jury.
   Keenan said such a move would constitute ``a waste of judicial
resources'' and would put an undue burden on the book's author,
Jeffrey Toobin, who decided to sue in New York.
   Keenan said he was ``fully capable'' of deciding whether
Toobin's manuscript violated laws governing the secrecy of grand
jury proceedings.
   Toobin, who worked for Walsh's Office of Independent Counsel
from 1987 to 1989, accuses Walsh of trying to stop publication of
his book about how the government built its case against Oliver
North.
   The suit said Walsh claims the final version of ``Opening
Arguments: A Young Lawyer's First Case - United States v. Oliver
North'' improperly discloses staff discussions and internal memos
of the office and that it violates grand jury secrecy.
   The book is ready for distribution to reviewers and is scheduled
for publication by Viking early next year, said Viking's parent
corporation, Penguin Books USA, which brought the suit with Toobin.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Iraq Test Fired Another Surface-to-Surface Missile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq test-fired a surface-to-surface
missile Wednesday, but the projectile was aimed away from the
multinational forces massed in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Central
Command said.
   The command said in a statement it had ``received indications
... that Iraqi armed forces conducted activity that included the
firing of another surface-to-surface missile within Iraq.''
   Previous such firings put some of the 300,000 American forces
deployed in Operation Desert Shield on a heightened state of alert,
but the U.S. Command would not comment on the current alert status.
   ``The missile landed in Iraq. The flight path of the missile was
away from U.S. and coalition forces. The firing appeared to be part
of an additional training or testing mission,'' the statement said.
   No further details were available on the type or exact direction
of the missile fired, or on the methods used to detect it.
   U.S. troops were already on heightened alert because of the
possibility of a terrorist attack over the Christmas and New Year
holidays.
   Last Friday, some U.S. forces went on a low-level alert for a
possible chemical attack after a missile firing. It turned out to
be an Israeli missile test fired into the Mediterranean.
   British and U.S. military officials reported that Iraq test
fired Scud missiles from east to west on Dec. 2, prompting some
units to don gas masks against a possible chemical attack.
   If the missiles were fired north to south they would hit Saudi
Arabia.
   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Iraqi test firing
of three medium-range missiles apparently took U.S. military
officials by surprise.
   The first launch of the series was completed before American
satellites and sensors noticed it, the Times reported, and Israeli
and U.S. officials readied their air forces.
   The Iraqis are estimated to have 500 to 1,000 surface-to-surface
missiles of various types, either Soviet-built SS-1 Scud-Bs or
Iraqi variants.
   Baghdad bought 1,500 to 2,000 Scud-Bs during the 1980-88 war
with Iran and launched scores during that conflict.

   Gennady I. Yanayev, a 53-year-old lawyer nominated
Wednesday as a surprise choice to become the Soviet Union's first
vice president, has risen steadily in the Communist bureaucracy by
showing strong party loyalty.
   Neither reformers nor conservatives in the Congress of People's
Deputies, the nation's parliament, reacted enthusiastically to his
nomination by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Many said they would
support him anyway.
   Most of the speculation had centered on other, more prominent
people who have worked closely with Gorbachev.
   After Gorbachev told the Congress he wanted Yanayev, the
cavernous Palace of Congress was silent for a moment, followed by a
smattering of applause.
   Yanayev took the floor and told deputies he supports Gorbachev's
reform program and would work to help stabilize the economy if
confirmed. The Congress is to vote on the nomination Thursday.
   The vice presidency, a new job in the Soviet Union, has not been
fully defined by Soviet officials. It could be powerful. A
constitutional amendment says the vice president ``replaces the
president of the U.S.S.R. in case of his absence and inability to
carry out his duties.''
   Yanayev told the Congress the nation needs ``consolidation of
all socio-political forces around the platform of the president's
anti-crisis program and the decisions of the Congress.''
   ``In this 300-million person country, we don't have any right to
carry out unpredictable, convulsive politics. If we adopt some kind
of shock transition to the market, that would mean that in the
first year we would have tens of millions of unemployed people,''
Yanayev said. His remarks and those of other people in the chamber
were reported by Tass, the state new agency.
   Yanayev urged respect for law and law enforcement institutions,
such as the army and KGB.
   In the past, he has expressed concern about Soviet involvement
in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Any solution by force might provoke unpredictable
consequences. We do not want those consequences to occur,'' Yanayev
said in August when the Kremlin was looking for a diplomatic
settlement in the gulf.
   After Yanayev's nomination, Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, one of those mentioned earlier as a possible vice
president, said curtly: ``Yes, I will support him. No, I will not
comment on his merits.''
   The Russian republic's information minister, Mikhail Poltoranin,
told reporters a worse candidate would have been hard to find, but
that ``Gennady Yanayev stands a chance to be elected by the current
Congress.''
   Yanayev, an ethnic Russian, was graduated from the Gorky
Agricultural Institute in 1959. He obtained a law degree in 1967
from the All-Union Juridical Correspondence Institute.
   He later worked as a mechanical engineer in Gorky before
becoming a volunteer in the Communist Party's youth organization,
the Komsomol.
   In the early 1970s, he came to Moscow to become chairman of the
U.S.S.R. Committee of Youth Organizations, a group that deals with
foreign youth movements in conjunction with the party.
   In the 1980s, he served for six years as deputy chairman of the
Soviet Friendship Society, a group that maintains non-governmental
contacts with foreigners.
   He later returned to the Komsomol and ascended to the
policy-making Central Committee, eventually becoming a secretary.
He was elected to the party's ruling Politburo in July after a
party shake-up that also significantly decreased the authority of
the Politburo.
   This year, he also became an official of the government-run
trade union organization, which has tried to distance itself from
its pro-government positions to compete with an assertive
independent workers' movement.
   Yanayev is a member of the parliament, where he is a leader of
the 730-member Communist bloc.

<HEAD>Governor Apologizes for Bethesda Chain Saw Massacre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

   Gov. William Donald Schaefer personally
apologized Wednesday for a state work crew which mistakenly cut
down seven trees bordering Arun Vohra's yard.
   ``We made a mistake and we're going to do everything we can to
rectify it,'' said Schaefer in a visit to Vohra's home in this
Washington suburb.
   The governor, accompanied by several aides including state
Transportation Secretary James Lighthizer, made the 40-mile trip
from Annapolis to see Vohra and the stumps that remained along the
highway outside his house after the saga known familiarly as the
Bethesda Chain Saw Massacre.
   One of the felled trees was a massive cedar 80 feet to 100 feet
high. ``That was a great tree,'' admitted the governor.
   Schaefer called the tree-cutting incident a result of missed
communications. ``We made a mistake ... (and) we learned,'' said
the governor.
   The story of the seven destroyed trees - all on a state
right-of-way - began last spring when Vohra notified the state
highway administration about a diseased pine tree on state property
in front of his house.
   A few days later he came home and found that tree still
standing, but six other ``awesome'' trees - two pines, three
blooming dogwoods and a giant lilac - had been cut.
   He complained, and soon another state official came to his house
and was shown the suspect tree. Vohra said he marked the tree with
a ribbon. But then, next time around, he returned from work and
found the massive cedar a few feet from the pine tree had been cut.
The pine tree, still, was untouched.
   ``I acted a little crazy,'' recalled Vohra. He called the
governor's mansion in Annapolis, his state delegate, his
congresswoman and the state department of natural resources. And
the story began to get some press.
   Vohra was informed this week that the governor wanted to visit,
so he made coffee and ordered some extra food for his guests.
   As the entourage arrived, Vohra expressed surprise at all the
attention given his loss. ``I had no idea this would ever happen,''
he said.
   Schaefer said ``We want to do the right thing,'' and promised
the state would replace whatever trees Vohra chooses. ``I'm tree
conscious,'' said the governor, reminding reporters he has vowed to
plant 1 million trees in Maryland.
   The two men posed atop the stump that once had been the massive
cedar. Nearby was the pine that started all the trouble. State
officials have since said it's not diseased at all, but only the
target of woodpeckers.

   Left-wing legislators accused the Israeli
government Wednesday of risking U.S. aid for absorption of Soviet
immigrants by erecting hundreds of trailer homes and apartments in
the occupied territories.
   But in Washington, the State Department said Israel has assured
U.S. officials that no immigrants will be directed to settle in new
housing projects planned for the occupied lands.
   About 100,000 Israelis live among 1.7 million Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East War. The United States objects to these settlements and
considers them an obstacle to peace efforts.
   Haim Oron of the socialist Mapam party said Housing Minister
Ariel Sharon told Parliament's Finance Committee on Monday that
1,000 trailers and another 1,200 apartments would be go up in the
West Bank and Gaza in the coming year.
   Another 300 trailer homes have been moved into the disputed
territories in the past year, Oron quoted Sharon as saying.
   Oron said Sharon insisted the government was not steering Soviet
immigrants to the occupied territories, in keeping with American
conditions for $400 million in loan guarantees voted by Congress
this year.
   But Oron argued that a housing shortage in Israel could easily
propel immigrants to the occupied territories.
   ``People go where there are apartments, whether they are
immigrants or old- timers,'' Oron said.
   ``Sharon never said it was being built for immigrants, but I
think he's putting the issue at risk, since the Americans are
unequivocally against their money reaching the territories,'' Oron
added.
   A communique from Sharon's office said a total of 33,000
trailers were to be purchased over the next year but did not say
where they would be parked.
   Sharon's spokesman, Nimrod Granit, was not available at his
office to comment.
   Sharon, a former defense minister, has led the Jewish settlement
effort in the occupied lands since 1977, when he first joined an
Israeli Cabinet as agriculture minister.
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres has also accused the government
of indirectly pushing immigrants to move to the occupied
territories by moving trailers there.
   ``Once the trailers are built there, they will say: `We have no
choice, the immigrants have no place to live,' and they will be
forced to move there,'' Peres was quoted as telling a party forum
on Dec. 13.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
on Wednesday said Israeli authorities have provided assurances that
they ``are not going to direct immigrants from the Soviet Union
beyond the green line'' - Israel's internationally recognized
border until 1967.
   He also reaffirmed U.S. opposition to Israel's policy of
establishing settlements in the territories, calling the activity
an ``obstacle to peace.''
   Soviet immigration has totaled more than 170,000 this year, and
construction of housing in Israel has fallen far short of demand.
   Israeli reports say construction is under way on less than half
of 45,000 apartments planned for this year.
   They said Sharon promised the committee that all would be in the
building process by the end of the fiscal year in April.
   Meantime, immigrant families are doubling up in apartments in
some Israeli towns. Many arriving in the past month have been put
up temporarily in hotels and army bases.

<TEXT>
   A floating crane on Wednesday pulled from
Haifa Bay the chartered ferry that capsized last weekend, drowning
21 sailors from the USS Saratoga aircraft carrier.
   As the red and white ferry was pulled ashore, sailors watched
from the Saratoga's deck with binoculars and cameras.
   Water poured from the broken ferry windows and orange life
jackets tumbled into choppy waves. A U.S. helicopter hovered
overhead.
   Israeli and American authorities are investigating the sinking.
   On initial inspection Wednesday, the ship seemed to be in good
condition with no obvious problems, Israel army radio said.
   Israel television said investigation teams would inspect the
ferry's hull Thursday for any defect that could have led to the
disaster.
   The 57-foot Israeli ferry, hired to transport the U.S. sailors,
was about 200 yards from the Saratoga early Saturday when it was
swamped by two swells, survivors said. Israeli officials believe
the ship may have been destabilized when too many men gathered in
its aft.
   The Saratoga and its escort ships had come from the Red Sea,
where they were participating in the anti-Iraqi force. The
servicemen were on shore leave in Haifa, about 75 miles northwest
of Jerusalem.
   The accident was the deadliest involving U.S. servicemen during
the Persian Gulf buildup.

   What do Greg LeMond, Joe Montana and Garry
Kasparov have in common?
   All three are world champions in their sports the last five
years - not once or twice, but three times.
   Kasparov, the reigning world chess champion, finished off
Anatoly Karpov for the third straight time in the championship
finals with a draw on Wednesday and proved once again that he is at
the top of his sport, like cycling champion Lemond and San
Francisco 49ers quarterback Montana.
   LeMond has won the world's most prestigious race, the Tour de
France, the last three times he has competed in it.
   Montana is considered the finest quarterback in pro football,
and has four Super Bowl rings to disprove naysayers.
   Now Kasparov, world chess champion since 1985, has reaffirmed
himself as the world's premier chess strategist.
   Kasparov was aprodigy, starting to play chess at 4.
   He was born April 13, 1963, in Baku, Azerbaijan, and was
originally named Gary Kimovich Weinstein. At six, after the death
of his father, he was taken in by his mother's family and adopted
her name, Klara Kasparova.
   Kasparov soon showed his chess potential, winning the Soviet
junior championship at 13 and the world junior title at 17.
   He challenged Karpov for the world title in 1984, which resulted
in a notable confrontation.
   Karpov went ahead, 5-0, in a match when draws didn't count.
Kasparov came back to narrow the score to 5-3.
   Suddenly, after five months and 48 games, the International
Chess Federation decided to call off the contest, saying it was for
the good of the players.
   Kasparov took the championship outright in 1985 by a score of
13-11 to become the youngest champion in the history of chess at
22.
   He retained the crown in 1986 in a series split between London
and Leningrad, 12.5-11.5.
   In their last meeting in Seville in 1987, Karpov led, 12-11,
going into the final game.
   Kasparov, unshaven and needing a victory to even the series and
retain his title, played aggressively, rallied to win the game and
save his title.
   It was an electric atmposphere the final day and a 10-minute
standing ovation to the cheers of ``Torero, Torero!!'' that
traditionally hail bullfighters accompanied the triumph.
   Kasparov went for the kill this time, scoring a convincing win
over Karpov.
   After playing to 10 draws of 12 games in New York, Kasparov won
three of the last seven games with three draws to beat Karpov.
   The two men, who are known to dislike each other, differ in
temperment, looks, politics and even playing style.
   Kasparov is talkative and flamboyant, playing chess with
creativity and decisiveness.
   Karpov, 39, is often protrayed as a colorless introvert who
plays with surgical precision.
   ``I have two loves,'' Karpov has said. ``Communism and chess.''
   ``Normally chess is a battle between two individuals,'' Kasparov
once said in an interview. ``But in my case, with Karpov, it's a
fight between two different mentalities in Russia. I identify him
with the system I've been fighting.''
   ``Karpov represents the power authorities,'' Kasparov said in a
previous interview. ``He was (Soviet leader Leonid) Brezhnev's boy
when Brezhnev was in power and is (President Mikhail) Gorbachev's
boy when Gorbachev is in power.''
   The pair's personality clash has endured more 150 encounters in
official competition over 700 hours.
   But in Lyon, after a draw or a decision, they often discussed
their play, almost amicably.
   ``I know him. He knows me,'' Kasparov said in an interview.
``You have to realize he is the only serious opponent for me. I am
talking chess with the No. two in the world.''
   Kasparov is the highest-rated player in the history of the
sport, with 2,800 points in rating chess grandmasters. The previous
best was 2,785 by American chess genius Bobby Fischer, who held the
world title from 1972 until he refused to defend it in 1975. That
allowed Karpov to take it until Kasparaov came along.
   Married last year, Kasparov dabbles in other fields. He likes
jogging, tennis and has attended a number of games of the soccer
club Moscow Spartak.
   He founded one of the first computer clubs in the Soviet Union
and was an advocate for getting paid his prize money in
tournaments. That led to Soviet tennis players Natalia Zvereva and
Andrei Chesnokov also demanding their winnings rather than
splitting them with the state.

   Actor Tom Cruise married his ``Days of
Thunder'' co-star, Nicole Kidman, during a private Christmas Eve
ceremony at a Colorado ski resort, his publicist said Wednesday.
   The 30-minute civil ceremony was witnessed by a handful of
family members, said Cruise publicist Andrea Jaffe.
   Details about the wedding weren't disclosed.
   It was the first marriage for the Australian actress and the
second for Cruise, whose nearly three-year marriage to actress Mimi
Rogers ended January in divorce.
   The couple surfaced in Telluride, Colo., on Christmas Eve with
other family members. Their honeymoon plans weren't disclosed.
   Cruise, 28, met Miss Kidman, 23, while filming ``Days of
Thunder.''
   Among Cruise's other movies are ``Risky Business,'' ``Top Gun,''
``The Color of Money,'' ``Rain Man'' and ``Born on the Fourth of
July.''
   Miss Kidman is currently filming ``Billy Bathgate,'' co-starring
Dustin Hoffman.
   Cruise and his bride are in pre-production for their next film
together, ``The Irish Story,'' directed by Ron Howard.

   Saddam Hussein said the American army would lose a war with Iraq
because it doesn't have ``right on its side.'' Washington took
steps Wednesday to pull American civilians from the increasingly
tense Persian Gulf region.
   In the Arabian Sea, meanwhile, U.S. and other sailors enforcing
the U.N. trade embargo aimed at forcing Iraq from Kuwait fired
warning shots in a fracas with crew members and female activists
aboard an Iraqi ship.
   But there were also reports of renewed diplomacy in the
4-month-old gulf crisis. An Israeli newspaper said Wednesday that
Washington and Baghdad had broken a deadlock and set a date for
talks.
   The independent daily Maariv, quoting Israeli diplomats in
contact with American officials, said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will likely meet with President Saddam in Baghdad on Jan.
9. The State Department denied any date was set.
   Jan. 15 is the U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or
face possible attack.
   Saddam has recalled his ambassadors from western Europe, the
United States and other nations, but there is speculation Iraq is
planning a new diplomatic initiative.
   In an interview broadcast Wednesday by Mexican television,
though, Saddam spoke only of war.
   ``It is certain that the American army will be defeated,''
Saddam told Mexico's Televisa network. ``But you know why? Because
it does not have right on its side ... because the American army
has left its land ... has come to kill a people who live in
security and in stability.''
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a U.S. intelligence officer gave a
bleak assessment Wednesday of peace prospects. Air Force Lt. Col.
Tom Coury of the U.S. Central Command intelligence staff said U.S.
officials think Saddam may attack Israel to break up the
international force opposing him if he believes war is inevitable.
   ``We see absolutely no indication that Saddam Hussein intends to
withdraw from Kuwait,'' Coury said.
   He also said it is likely Iraq will use chemical weapons if it
is attacked.
   In another development, the U.S. Central Command said Iraq
test-fired a surface-to-surface missile Wednesday. The projectile
was aimed away from the multinational forces massed in Saudi
Arabia, officials said. No other details were available.
   In his broadcast comments, Saddam reiterated he would not allow
the United States to set a date for his meeting with Baker.
Washington has suggested a meeting on or before Jan. 3, but Saddam
has insisted talks be held Jan. 12.
   ``The Iraqi people reject that its president receives orders
from outside,'' Saddam said.
   Washington also appeared to have little optimism about the
crisis. The State Department asked all non-essential personnel and
dependents of U.S. government workers to leave Jordan and Sudan
before the Jan. 15 deadline.
   The State Department recommended that U.S. citizens defer travel
to the two nations, both of whose populations generally support
Iraq.
   It said earlier that pro-Iraqi sentiment could be directed at
Americans in Yemen, Mauritania, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and eastern Saudi Arabia. It had recommended non-essential
U.S. personnel leave those countries as well.
   Meanwhile, U.S. sailors enforcing the U.N. trade embargo boarded
an Iraqi ship near Masirah Island. They were involved in a
30-minute melee with the crew and female peace activists from 10
Arab countries, Italy, China, the United States and Japan.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman, Cmdr. Mark Neuhart, said the trouble
started when U.S. sailors approached the pilot house of the
freighter ``and a number of the crew attempted to hold the boarding
party members back and grab their weapons.''
   The sailors fired warning shots, a smoke grenade and a
noisemaker grenade ``for crowd control,'' he said. There were no
injuries, he said.
   The 11,333-ton Ibn Khaldoon carried 800 tons of sugar in
violation of the U.N. sanctions. Pro-Iraqi Arab news reports have
dubbed the vessel ``the peace ship'' and said it was sailing to the
Iraqi port of Basra in a demonstration of support for Saddam and
his initiatives for solving the gulf crisis.
   The Israeli newspaper said the Jan. 9 date for talks aimed at
resolving the gulf crisis was set amid secret negotiations between
the United States and Iraq. But a State Department spokeswoman
denied any date had been set.
   Diplomats in the region say Saddam might be willing to make
concessions if he can win linkage between resolution of the gulf
crisis and efforts toward establishing Palestinian self-rule in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   The United States and its allies have rejected linking an Iraqi
pullout from occupied Kuwait to the Palestinian issue.
   But Maariv said a Jan. 9 Baker-Saddam meeting could be tied to
plans by Dennis Ross, director of the State Department's policy
planning staff, to visit Israel on Jan. 7 to discuss new Middle
East peace proposals.
   The State Department appears to be putting together a proposal
for opening peace talks between Israel and Arab countries in tandem
with holding municipal elections in the occupied territories, the
paper said.

<TEXT>
   Moroccan courts sentenced 47 people to
prison terms of up to seven years for rioting during a general
strike this month, officials said Wednesday.
   The sentences were the most severe so far in dozens of trials
following Dec. 14-15 unrest in Morocco which killed at least five
people.
   Forty people in Fez drew sentences late Tuesday and Wednesday
ranging from one to seven years in jail on charges of rebellion,
destruction of property, carrying arms and attacking the liberty to
work, Twelve were acquitted.
   Seven people, aged 18 to 29, were sentenced in Meknes,
north-central Morocco, to terms of six months to one year in prison
on similar charges.
   Courts in Tangier and Sidi-Kacem last Friday sentenced 37 people
in all to prison terms ranging up to one year.
   Fez suffered the worst violence. Rioters there attacked hotels,
post offices and a police station. The government says five people
were killed there and 127 injured. It said security forces withheld
fire. The two unions that called the strike claim about 30 people
were killed.
   Thirty-three other defendants are awaiting trial in Fez. Also on
trial is Mohamed Titna Alaoui, leader of the Fez branch of the
General Moroccan Workers' Union, which along with the Democratic
Work Confederation called the strike.
   The government claimed unidentified foreign powers helped foment
the unrest.
   It is negotiating with unions and employers on ``priority
measures'' promised after the riots, the official MAP news agency
reported, including increases in minimum wages and in social
allocations.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner Says Body Not That of Helen Brach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cook County medical examiner is convinced a
recently exhumed body is not that of missing candy heiress Helen
Brach, but federal investigators said Wednesday they haven't ruled
out the possibility.
   Medical examiner Robert Stein said he and a team of scientists,
including a forensic dentist, an anthropologist and a radiologist,
studied the body.
   ``It's definitely not Helen Brach,'' Stein said Monday. ``As far
as we're concerned the case is closed.''
   Federal authorities plan more examinations on the body,
including a DNA test, said Jerry Singer, spokesman for the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Stein called it ``silly'' for federal investigators to continue
believing the body may be Mrs. Brach's. He refused to elaborate on
how the team of scientists ruled out the possibility.
   The still-unidentified body was exhumed Dec. 11 from a pauper's
grave. The hands and part of the face were missing, the Chicago
Tribune has reported.
   Mrs. Brach, heiress to the Brach Candy Co. fortune, was 65 and
had an estimated net worth of $17 million when she disappeared in
1977 after checking out of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   She was declared legally dead in 1984. Most of her estate, now
valued at more than $50 million, went to the Helen Brach
Foundation, a charitable trust. Her husband, Frank V. Brach, who
was president of E.J. Brach and Sons Candy Co., died in 1970.
   The discovery of the body in a suburban forest in 1978 raised
speculation it was that of Mrs. Brach. Stein ruled then the body
was not that of the missing heiress and it was buried.
   The results of a yearlong racketeering fraud investigation
prompted federal authorities to exhume the body, Singer said.
   He and other state and federal authorities have refused to
divulge further details.
   ``We refrain from commenting on the particulars of an open
investigation,'' Singer said. ``All we can say is that the process
is still continuing and there's no timetable as to when the
examinations will be completed.''

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar may seek help from member nations' consulates in Israel to
monitor the safety of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories,
U.N. officials said Wednesday.
   They said he was consulting through the Interntional Committee
of the Red Cross about using the consular staff in Israel of the
164 nations that signed the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention on
protecting civilians in occupied lands.
   The Security Council told the secretary-general last Thursday to
discern the views of the signatory nations about a possible meeting
to discuss implementing the Geneva convention and helping
Palestinians.
   Signatories include the United States, Britain, France, Canada
and others.
   Perez de Cuellar also is considering expanding the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees, to observe
and report on the Palestinians' situation in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. Israel seized the territories in the 1967 Mideast War.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any
change in the agency's mandate was unlikely in view of Israeli and
U.S. opposition to expanding UNRWA's role.
   They said no decisions have been made. The U.N. chief is on
vacation until Jan. 4.
   The Security Council resolution, adopted unanimously, asks the
secretary-general ``to monitor and observe the situation in the
occupied Palestinian territories, on an urgent basis, using the
United Nations personnel stationed there and appointing the
necessary staff to accomplish this task.''
   Arab nations called it an important first step in council
involvement to protect Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   They say the council must act evenhandedly in opposing both
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and Israel's occupation of the
territories by subjecting Israel to economic and other sanctions,
like Iraq.
   Perez de Cuellar says he will send his personal emissary,
Jean-Claude Aime, to study the situation, but has yet to announce a
trip.
   He also accepted an Israeli invitation to visit, but no date was
announced. UNRWA, created in 1949, has 2,300 staff in the region.
The agency helps more than 2.1 million refugees, including hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians in Israel and elsewhere.

<HEAD>Peruvian President Overturns Bank Nationalization Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alberto Fujimori has repealed the
controversial bank nationalization law passed three years ago by
his predecessor, Alan Garcia.
   Fujimori's decree was published Dec. 25 in the official
newspaper. The decree came after both houses of Congress voted to
repeal the law, under which 33 private banks and insurance
companies would have been nationalized.
   The law was announced Aug. 9, 1987, by Garcia, who at the time
said the measure aimed at ``democratizing credit.'' It was later
approved by Congress, then dominated by Garcia's party, APRA.
   The unpopular law was immediately challenged in court. It has
never taken effect because the court has yet to issue a ruling.
   However, it raised fears of further nationalizations and
exacerbated capital flight, estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion
during Garcia's tenure, according to private economists.
   After the law was announced, police occupied Peru's two largest
private banks. Bankers and politicians then began to organize large
rallies against the measre.
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa eventually emerged as leader of the
groups opposed to the law. These groups later formed a political
party, which named Vargas Llosa as its presidential candidate for
1990 elections. He lost to Fujimori, who became president in July
and heads the Change 90 party.
   Fujimori has 120 days to present a new law to regulate bank
activities.

<HEAD>Iranian Spiritual Leader Says Rushdie Death Sentence in Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's spiritual leader on Wednesday
rejected the latest concessions of author Salman Rushdie, saying
his death sentence for offending Moslems remains in effect.
   Rushdie issued a statement in London on Monday embracing Islam.
It stated that the author would not seek the printing of a
paperback edition of his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' and would
not allow its translation into any more languages.
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's leader, called for
Rushdie's death in February 1989 for allegedly defaming Islam in
his book.
   In a statement carried by Tehran radio, Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday the death sentence still
stands.
   ``God willing, from now on no one will dare insult the great
messenger of God, and Islamic sanctities,'' Khamenei said in the
statement monitored in Nicosia.
   He said Rushdie's contention that he had not meant to cause
offense would do him no good.
   Quoting Khomeini, he said that ``even if he (Rushdie) repents
and becomes the most pious Muslim on earth, there will be no change
in this divine decree.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold 1 million copies. It has been
translated into 15 languages.
   The radical daily newspaper Jomhuri Islami stressed that the
death sentence is irrevocable, and it called on Rushdie to prepare
to die.
   ``If Rushdie's repentance and his return to Islam are seen as a
sign of his bravery, naturally it is necessary that he shows
greater bravery and prepares himself for death,'' the
Farsi-language newspaper said Wednesday.
   ``He will die anyway, but he will be better off to choose his
way to eternal salvation courageously before a son of Islam fires
the coup de grace,'' it added.
   The editorial was reported by Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency and monitored in Cyprus.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Khomeini called for his death,
and Tehran put a $1 million bounty on his head.
   Iran cut diplomatic ties with Britain over the Rushdie affair.
The ties were restored Sept. 27 after British officials publicly
conceded the book had offended Moslems and said the government had
no wish to do so.
   Khamenei said Wednesday that Rushdie's statement demonstrated
that ``Western arrogance has been forced to retreat step by step.''
   He added that ``the edict, and the commitment of Moslems around
the world to implement it, is showing its first results.''
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has attempted
gradually to rebuild Iran's ties with the West, has not rescinded
the death edict. But his supporters have indicated they are willing
to let the decree lapse.

   Garry Kasparov of the Soviet Union retained
his title as world chess champion Wednesday with a draw in the 22nd
game, defeating his longtime rival, countryman Anatoly Karpov.
   The pair ended the 22nd of the 24-match chess championship
series with a draw after 43 moves. The half-point each player
received put the 27-year-old Kasparov ahead 12-10, allowing him to
remain champion.
   ``I was really nervous because I didn't know what to do, whether
to play for the win or draw,'' Kasparov said afterward. ``Then my
life became much easier when I had the worse positions, and I had
to fight for the draw - and I obliged.''
   Though Kasparov has clinched the title, the two must play two
more games to determine how the $3 million purse is split. If there
is a 12-12 draw after 24 games, the purse will be split evenly; if
Kasparov gets another draw or win, he gains $1.7 million.
   Kasparov won the title from Karpov in 1985. At 22, he was the
youngest champion in chess history. He defended the crown by
beating Karpov in 1986 and 1987.
   Karpov had taken the championship in 1975 when American Bobby
Fischer refused to defend the title he won in 1972.
   Kasparov, playing white, arrived promptly at the 5 p.m. (11 a.m.
EDT) Wednesday, the starting time at the Palais des Congres. He
fidgeted with his pieces awaiting the arrival of Karpov, then made
his first move, advancing his king's pawn, before his rival
entered.
   The 39-year-old challenger, 10 minutes late, made an identical
first move.
   They went into an opening known as the Ruy Lopez with the
Zaitsev variation, seen before in the second, fourth and 20th
games. Kasparov won the second and the 20th using white.
   But Karpov, playing aggressively, pulled slightly ahead by the
25th move and had two pawns well advanced before Kasparov captured
them.
   By the 30th move, Kasparov had a pawn clear on the queen's side
of the board as well as three more pawns, but black had a knight.
   Both players still had two bishops and their queens, along with
their kings.
   The pair traded bishops and then, on the 38th move, Karpov
offered a queen exchange.
   Kasparov thought about it for 10 minutes and then moved his
queen to put Karpov in check.
   Karpov moved out of check but Kasparov put Karpov in check,
forcing a perpetual check situation.
   Karpov, realizing the forced draw was the likely outcome, looked
at Kasparov and shook hands, implicitly offering the draw and
giving Kasparov the world title again.
   Kasparov showed little emotion, talked over the game briefly
with Karpov and then smiled when being interviewed.
   The two men, who are known to dislike each other, differ in
temperment, looks, politics and playing style.
   Kasparov is talkative and flamboyant, playing chess with
creativity and decisiveness. He is reform-minded in his politics.
   Karpov is often protrayed as a colorless introvert who plays
with surgical precision. ``I have two loves,'' Karpov has said.
``Communism and chess.''
   ``Normally chess is a battle between two individuals,'' Kasparov
once said. ``But in my case, with Karpov, it's a fight between two
different mentalities in Russia. I identify him with the system
I've been fighting.''
   The 22nd game had been delayed a week. Karpov had called a
timeout Saturday, then the organizers called a technical timeout on
Christmas Eve, twice postponing the game.
   Kasparov rallied to beat Karpov after committing what he called
``the worst blunder of my career'' during the first round of play
in New York. It occurred in the seventh game, when Kasparov
misplayed a bishop and gave Karpov an advantage that allowed the
challenger to win and tie the series at 3.5 points each.
   However, Kasparov won the previous three times he had white in
the nine games in Lyon. Karpov had only won twice in the 21
previous games of the series.
   The two Soviet grandmasters had six draws in the French portion
of the championship. They drew 10 times in the 12 games played in
New York between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7.

   Authorities chasing suspects in an ambush
on police lobbed a grenade at a house Wednesday and set it on fire,
killing at least four Kashmiri militants, witnesses said. Police
said the extremists were only wounded.
   The witnesses said the militants hiding in the house were the
ones who ambushed an Indian police patrol in Kupwara, which borders
Pakistani-held Kashmir.
   They said police demanded the militants surrender but the
militants continued to fire bullets from inside.
   The witnesses in Kupwara, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said at least four militants were killed.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said he did not have details. But he said information
indicated the four militants were injured and not dead.
   He said no policemen were killed.
   The Moslem militants fighting for Kashmir's independence
frequently ambush police patrols. Police have often retaliated by
setting fire to houses in villages where the militants take refuge.
   The government of predominantly Hindu India accuses Pakistan of
training and arming the militants. Pakistan denies the allegation
but says it is sympathetic to the cause of the militants.
   Both India and Pakistan claim Jammu-Kashmir state, the only
Moslem-majority state in mainly Hindu India.
   Since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, the two
countries have fought two wars over the disputed state. They came
close to another war last spring when Kashmiri militants stepped up
their violent campaign for secession from India.

   Soviet Deputy Premier Igor Belousov
arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday for talks, the official Iraqi News
Agency said.
   Soviet diplomats in Baghdad said Belousov's principal mission
was to try to persuade Soviet workers still in Iraq to leave the
country before the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   INA, monitored in Nicosia, said the Soviet minister thanked Iraq
for allowing Soviet experts to leave the country although the terms
of their contracts had not expired.
   Iraq decided Dec. 4 that all the Soviet workers and experts in
the country could leave. However, about 1,000 Soviet workers have
elected to stay in Iraq, where they earn hard currency, rather than
returning to the Soviet Union to face a winter of hardships.

<TEXT>
   Army coup leaders were reported living up to their promise to
refrain from repressive measures in Suriname, but Venezuela on
Wednesday called the toppling of the democratically elected
government intolerable and asked for world action.
   The U.S. and Dutch governments earlier condemned the coup in the
former Dutch colony. The State Department advised Americans on
Wednesday not to travel to Suriname and told U.S. citizens in that
small, South American nation of 400,000 people to stay indoors.
   The Foreign Ministry in Caracas, Venezuela, said it would refuse
to recognize Suriname's new military government, and asked for a
``firm response'' to the bloodless coup on Christmas Eve that
ousted President Ramsewak Shankar.
   A report from Paramaribo, capital of Suriname, quoted Shankar as
saying he and his ministers were not under house arrest and that he
had complete freedom of movement. He was reached by telephone at
his home late Tuesday.
   A newspaper editor in Suriname, Leo Morpurgo of the morning
daily De Ware Tyd, said on Wednesday that the military has not
restricted the press or civil rights since the overthrow.
   Venezuela emphasized, however, that the November 1987 elections
that brought Shankar to power in January 1988 ``expressed the free
will and sovereignty of the Surinamese people'' and said the coup
must be condemned as as an ``intolerable violation of democracy.''
   ``This is a regression in the process of Latin American
democracy,'' said a communique from the office of Foreign Minister
Reinaldo Figueredo.
   It demanded immediate restitution of the Shankar government and
said the international community should taken ``necessary
measures'' to restore the president. A first step might be foreign
governments' refusing to recognize the new Suriname government, a
government source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shankar was ousted in an uprising led by acting army chief Cmdr.
Ivan Graanoogst, who then pledged to hold elections within 100 days
and relinquish power.
   The army has not spelled out what motivated the coup, but is
expected to blame Shankar for not restoring economic health.
   The coup mastermind was thought to be Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse,
who resigned as army chief hours before Shankar was toppled. He and
Shankar have long feuded.
   Bouterse ruled Suriname for eight years after seizing power in a
1980 military coup and wielded considerable power even after
Shankar's government was overwhelmingly elected three years ago.
   Surinamese citizens stayed home from work Wednesday, a regularly
scheduled national holiday. Their only information about the coup
came from radio and television. Newspapers there do not publish on
Christmas Day or the day after.
   The army leaders who seized power in Suriname, a Georgia-sized
nation on South America's northeastern coast, pledged allegiance to
democratic principles. They promised to govern in consultation with
the elected National Assembly until elections can be held.
   ``The army is not bent on having and keeping power,'' Graanoogst
said in a Christmas Day radio address. He said a ``non-political''
government Cabinet would be appointed within a week.
   Graanoogst is chief of military police and No. 2 in the military
chain of command.
   Bouterse has not been seen or made any public statements since
the coup.
   It was not immediately clear how the coup might affect an
insurgency that has crippled the mining of bauxite - a major export
used in producing aluminum. The army opposed a peace agreement
between guerrillas and the ousted government.
   In the 1987 election, Shankar's three-party coalition, the Front
for Democracy and Development, easily defeated the military-backed
National Democracy Party.

<HEAD>Executed Dictator's Jailed Son Says He Opposed Parents' Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicu Ceausescu, jailed son of executed Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, said in an interview published
Wednesday that his parents had dubbed him an enemy of the people
for opposing their policies.
   ``I told my parents that people were suffering as far back as
1970. From a political point of view, it was a generation
struggle,'' The Times of London quoted him as saying.
   The Times said the interview with its reporter, Tim Judah, took
place Monday in the hospital wing of Jilava jail near Bucharest,
the Romanian capital. It said the interview was conducted in the
presence of Nicu Ceausescu's lawyer, his doctor, and the chief
guard of the prison medical wing.
   The reporter quoted the doctor as saying Ceausescu was
terminally ill, suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, a varicosed
esophagus and depression.
   Communist President Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown in the
Romanian revolution. He and his wife Elena were executed by firing
squad on Dec. 25, 1989.
   Nicu Ceausescu, 40, is serving a 20-year jail term for
incitement to murder following the deaths of 89 people in Sibiu,
Transylvania, during the revolution. The former chief of Romania's
Communist Youth League, he was Communist Party first secretary at
Sibiu at the time.
   The Times' reporter quoted him as saying: ``The authorities are
afraid of me ... but I'm left here, an innocent man in prison,
wondering why.''
   Ceausescu was quoted as saying that before he fled Sibiu, he
ordered the army and the Securitate state security force not to
fire on revolutionary demonstrators but his orders were
countermanded. Ceausescu did not say by whom.
   He was quoted as saying he was banished to Sibiu because he
opposed his parents' actions. Judah said Ceausescu denied that
before the revolution, he had been preparing to succeed them.
   In the interview, the prisoner said his parents called him an
enemy of the people because he opposed the destruction of much of
old Bucharest to make way for the huge House of the People building
and the 2{-mile-long Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism.
   The reporter quoted him as saying his father knew only part of
what was happening in the country.
   ``He was surrounded by sycophants. In order to maintain their
privileges and power, they told me father that everything he did
was good and they agreed with everything he said. No one told him
the truth, so from this point of view it was a dictatorship,'' he
was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
   The government wrongfully seized a rental
building where tenants dealt drugs because the landlords were not
allowed to defend themselves against the action, an appeals court
ruled Wednesday.
   The seizure was carried out under a federal civil forfeiture law
that allows prosecutors to take property used for narcotics
activity.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a judge improperly
approved the seizure based only on a finding that the owners,
Harvey and Helen Lehrer, were aware tenants dealt drugs in the
Brooklyn building.
   The forfeiture law, adopted by Congress in 1988, includes a
clause designed to protect landlords. It states that the government
cannot seize buildings if the owners can prove they had no
knowledge of drug activity or that they made ``reasonable efforts''
to prevent illegal use of their property.
   The court said the couple didn't get the chance to show they
took steps to curtail drug activity.
   The appeals court reversed an order approving the seizure and
sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Thomas Platt to allow the
Lehrers to further defend themselves against the forfeiture.
   In December 1988, Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided
the building and found heroin, cocaine, cash and drug
paraphernalia. After the raid, the U.S. attorney's office took
steps to seize the building.
   Bernholtz said the building has been sealed and vacant since the
raid.

<HEAD>FTC Staff Again Urges End to Fin-Syn Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economics staff of the Federal Trade
Commission said Wednesday it again had urged the Federal
Communications Commission to abolish rules that keep broadcast
television networks from owning program rerun rights.
   The FTC's Economics Bureau first urged abolition of the rules in
September. It expanded its comments to include several proposed
modifications of the financial interest and syndication rules,
which commonly are called fin-syn.
   One proposal would regulate negotiations between program
producers and networks, negotiations about which the economists
said ``we do not find compelling reasons to adopt any of the
proposed restrictions.''
   A proposal that would modify but not abolish the rules ``may
lead to a result that is less desirable than either complete
elimination or complete retention of the rules,'' the bureau said.
   ``Our analysis of these options leads us to continue to believe
that the best course for the FCC is to repeal completely the
existing fin-syn rules,'' the bureau said.
   The Justice Department also has said the rules should be
eliminated.
   The FCC plans to decide next year whether to keep, junk or
change the rules, adopted 20 years ago when the broadcast networks
had a much larger shae of the prime-time viewing audience than
they have today.
   The rules permit the networks to own only the overseas rerun
rights to the prime-time shows they produce themselves and bar the
networks from any financial interest in other prime-time programs,
including any interest in off-network or ``syndicated'' showings.
   The FTC's Economics Bureau comments frequently on proposed
regulations of other federal agencies and state agencies, generally
urging views that would result in increased competition.

   Suspicious fires destroyed stores on the same
block Wednesday, disrupting post-Christmas shopping and creating a
colossal traffic jam.
   The noon-time blazes erupted simultaneously at Pier 1 Imports
and Strouds linen warehouse on opposite ends of the block in the
Studio City shopping district, fire officials said.
   Witnesses reported seeing a man dressed in black behind the
stores before the fires broke out, authorities said. Gasoline
containers were found.
   ``It is suspicious, very suspicious. Our arson investigators are
on the scene,'' said city fire spokesman Rinaldo Rojo.
   The only injury was to a firefighter, who suffered a minor burn,
said Greg Acevedo, another fire spokesman.
   Damage was expected to run into the millions of dollars.
   It was unknown how many people were in the stores when the fires
began. Shoppers and employees had fled both buildings by the time
firefighters arrived.
   ``I ran around and the whole comforter aisle was in flames,''
said Lisa Evans, who was inside Strouds when the fire erupted.
   It took more than 140 firefighters about 1{ hours to extinguish
the fires, Acevedo said.
   At the height of the fires, a pillar of smoke could be seen 10
miles away.
   Several other Ventura Boulevard businesses were damaged by the
fires, including a Realty office, a drug store and a guitar repair
shop.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo on Thursday
named a new prime minister and foreign minister and reshuffled
eight other Cabinet posts in a bid to spruce up his party's image
before next year's elections.
   Ro Jai-bong, 54, a chief aide and former university professor,
was named to succeed Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon, who reportedly
asked to retire from public life.
   Ro holds a doctorate in political science from New York
University. He would be expected to lead South Korea's delegation
in a fourth round of high-level talks on easing tensions with
longtime rival North Korea, scheduled for February.
   The new foreign minister was career diplomat Lee Sang-ok, the
ambassador to Switzerland and a former vice foreign minister.
   Cabinet changes were also made in trade and industry, labor,
unification, information, sports, transportation, communications
and education.
   Presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung announced the shakeup at a
news briefing Thursday.
   Park Seh-jik, chief of the Seoul Olympic Committee that staged
the successful 1988 Summer Olympic Games, was named mayor of Seoul.
   The changes were seen as an attempt by the governing Democratic
Liberal Party to spur public support before local elections to be
held in 1991.
   Roh's five-year term ends in 1992. He has made dramatic progress
in foreign relations by expanding Seoul's ties with socialist and
former communist nations, but support for his domestic policies is
at an all-time low.
   Roh has changed the Cabinet several times since taking office in
February 1988.
   On Wednesday, the Agency for National Security Planning, a
government intelligence agency, announced the arrest of 31 students
on charges of forming a North Korean-directed organization that
sought to overthrow the government.
   It said in a statement that more than 70 other members of the
Chamintong group were being sought and that the organization has
about 800 members.
   The agency said the goal of Chamintong - an acronym meaning
``independence, democracy and unification'' - was to form a unified
Korea by 1995 under the leadership of North Korea's Communist
chief, Kim Il Sung. It said the organization would resort to armed
fighting if necessary.
   The agency said investigations found that Chamintong has
manipulated the Chondaehyop, a dissident student alliance, to stage
anti-government and anti-American activities in the guise of
seeking democratization.
   The two Koreas have been separated since 1945 and fought in the
1950-53 Korean War.

   The government's 1990 census figures awarded
political clout to California and the South on Wednesday and
carried good news to Republican presidential candidates for at
least the rest of this century.
   At the same time, the numbers diminished the political strength
of states in the Northeast and Midwest, and set the stage for power
struggles in every state except the six which now have only one
congressional district each.
   As a result of the census count, congressional district lines
will be redrawn in every state except those six, and 19
congressional seats will be shifted.
   Eight states will gain representation - and power - in Congress.
Thirteen will lose seats and clout.
   California will be the chief gainer, adding seven more
congressional seats, bringing its total to 52. Florida will gain
four, going to 23; Texas will gain three, going to 30. And one
additional seat in the House will go to five states - Arizona,
going to six; Georgia, to 11; North Carolina, to 12; Virginia, to
11 and Washington, to nine.
   New York, going down to 31, will lose three seats. Two seats
will be lost by four states - Illinois, going to 20, Michigan, to
16; Ohio, to 19; and Pennsylvania, to 21.
   Eight states will lose one each - Iowa, going to five; Kansas,
to four; Kentucky, to six; Louisiana, to seven; Massachusetts, to
10; Montana, to one; New Jersey, to 13; and West Virginia, to
three.
   In presidential elections, the figures make winning easier for
Republicans because states which the GOP usually carries will gain
votes in the electoral college while states which the Democrats
depend upon will have less importance.
   A state's number of votes in the electoral college equals the
total of its congressmen and its two senators. So in the
presidential elections of 1992 and 1996, California, which no
Democrat has carried in a presidential election since 1964, will
have 54 of the 270 electoral votes a candidate needs to win the
presidency, or one out of five.
   The other states with new electoral college importance are also
in the West and Sunbelt - regions tending in recent years to go
Republican.
   ``The political consequences advantage the Republicans,'' said
Stephen Hess, political analyst at the Brookings Institution, a
research organization. ``The Republican vote has tended to come
more from the new West and the burgeoning Sunbelt.''
   Curtis Gans, director of the non-partisan Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate, disputed what he said was the
widespread view of the census figures as a ``windfall for the
Republicans.''
   He said Republicans will gain in congressional elections, but
only in the short run.
   Most states that gained seats did so because of growing Hispanic
populations, Gans said, and ``Hispanics of the class that is
expanding the population in California, Florida, New Mexico and
Arizona tend to vote 2-1 Democratic. Eventually that's going to
tell - probably within the next decade.'' Only in Florida, where
Cuban-Americans favor conservative candidates, can the Republicans
anticipate long-term gains, he said.
   Redistricting battles will start soon in the 43 states which
will have more than one representative in Congress - and they
promise to be particularly painful in states which must eliminate
seats held by incumbents.
   In New York, for example, redistricting may mean that Democratic
Reps. Charles Schumer and Stephen Solarz, both representing
Brooklyn, will have to compete for a single seat in the game of
musical chairs that a new census sets off every decade.
   It is no coincidence, Hess said, that both have built up
campaign war chests in the million-dollar range, anticipating a
costly battle to stay in Congress - or perhaps a costly race for a
post elsewhere, perhaps the Senate seat occupied by Republican
Alfonse M. D'Amato.
   The six states which have only one congressman, and thus avoid
redistricting, are Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Vermont and Wyoming. Montana, in losing a congressman in 1992, will
join that list.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reporter Testifies in Court Fight Over FBI Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter who received copies of
confidential FBI documents during the trial of nine organized crime
figures said Wednesday he knew who sent him the material and
promised the source anonymity.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh wants to recover the
documents from two newspapers and three television stations so
investigators can trace the leak.
   Initially, six news outlets that received the documents were
subpoenaed to give them to a federal grand jury. The Tribune-Review
of Greensburg relinquished the documents.
   Attorneys for The Pittsburgh Press, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and television stations KDKA and WPXI filed motions to quash the
subpoenas. Television station WTAE also received the documents, but
did not join in the motions.
   During a hearing, Post-Gazette reporter Mike Bucsko said he
received the documents in the mail several weeks before other news
organizations did. Bucsko said he knew the source and had promised
anonymity.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda L. Kelly didn't ask Bucsko to
identify the source in court.
   U.S. District Judge Donald J. Lee took the matter under
advisement and will rule later.
   Attorneys for the news organizations argued that relinquishing
the documents could ultimately identify the source, whether
reporters know the source or not.
   The government claims the documents, known as FBI 302 reports,
have value as evidence. Prosecutors have said whoever mailed the
documents could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice or
contempt of court.
   The reports were capsules of debriefings of federal witness
Marvin Droznek. The reports were among many shared by the
government with defense attorneys in the trial of nine organized
crime figures.
   A jury Oct. 29 convicted reputed organized crime underbosses
Charles ``Chucky'' Porter, Louis F. Raucci and seven others of
racketeering and related charges.
   The convictions ended an eight-week trial that prosecutors
called the largest ever involving organized crime figures in
western Pennsylvania.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year was one of rampant homicides and
violence in Los Angeles County, but public tolerance of the
bloodshed is even more troubling, the sheriff said Wednesday.
   In the past, Sheriff Sherman Block said, a homicide report would
bring news media running to the scene.
   ``Now, they call and ask, `Is it a routine murder?''' Block
said. ``We have routine murders. ... Homicides become box scores
like the baseball games. ... There doesn't seem to be the level of
outrage I think there should be at these events.''
   Block called 1990 a year of ``pluses and minuses'' for his
department, the largest minus being the conviction of six deputy
sheriffs on charges of skimming drug money. But he said he was
proud of the majority of honest people who make up his
12,000-member department.
   Block said the year's most troubling development was the
explosion of gang-related homicides responsible for pushing murder
figures up 32 percent in areas of the county policed by the
sheriff's department.
   There were 158 gang-related homicides within the sheriff's
jurisdiction during the first 11 months of this year, way up from
104 during the same period last year and shattering the record of
116 set for all of 1989.
   The sheriff said a report that 22 people died violently over the
Christmas weekend was ``not unusual.''
   ``What troubles me is the apparent tolerance of violence that we
have developed in this community,'' Block said.

   A senior Tunisian diplomat has been
sentenced to death for spying, government sources said Wednesday.
   Lamari Mohamed Dali, deputy director of the African Affairs
Department of the Tunisian Foreign Ministry, was arrested in
October for ``espionage for profit,'' said the sources, who would
not allow themselves to be further identified.
   Dali was passing ``secret documents'' to a foreign power when he
was arrested, said the sources, who declined to identify the other
country.
   Dali's death sentence was handed down Tuesday, the sources said.
His appeal is set to be heard Thursday.

   Industrialist Irl A. Daffin, who developed
labor-saving machines for the farming and construction industries,
has died at age 88.
   Daffin died Tuesday at his home in Lititz.
   In the early 1940s, Daffin and associates turned farmer-inventor
Edwin Nolt's idea for a hay baler into a moneymaking product.
   They bought control of New Holland Machine Co. and turned the
baler into the cornerstone of what is now Ford New Holland Inc., a
major manufacturer of agricultural implements.
   Daffin also developed a mobile feed mill and in his 70s founded
a charter airplane company bearing his name.
   ``I don't think I've ever been in anything yet that wasn't more
or less new,'' Daffin once said. ``You don't always get big, but
you have to think big.''
   Daffin, a native of Caroline County, Md., grew up on Maryland's
Eastern Shore and studied at the former Goldey Business College in
Wilmington, Del.

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday said that 60 Albanians
seeking political asylum crossed into Greece over two days.
   A police spokesman in the capital said border posts reported the
Albanians, including 37 ethnic Greeks, walked across the frontier
near the villages of Delvinakion and Filiates. He said most arrived
on Tuesday.
   ``It's a madhouse here, the police station is full of
refugees,'' a police officer in Delvinakion said.
   The Albanians all filed for political asylum and were to be
taken to a United Nations refugee center on the outskirts of
Athens. Ethnic Greeks are automatically granted asylum.
   The spokesman in Delvinakion said on condition of anonymity that
he did not know if any Albanians had been stopped on the other side
of the border.
   He said local welfare agencies were giving refugees food,
clothing and pocket money.
   Albanians have been trickling into Greece since last summer,
when protests of Albania's Communist government broke out in the
tiny Balkan nation of 3.3 million.
   The Greek government has accused Albanian authorities of
murdering many ethnic Greeks who try to cross the border.
   Government spokesman Vyron Polydoras on Monday charged that
Albanian soldiers shot and killed three men, including an ethnic
Greek. He did not say when the killings occurred but described them
as ``extermination in the most revolting fashion.''
   The Christmas exodus was the second-largest in three days,
police said.
   On Monday, 107 Albanians, including 70 ethnic Greeks, fled into
Greece.
   Greece claims there are more than 350,000 ethnic Greeks living
in southern Albania. The Albanian government says the minority only
numbers 60,000.
   In Brindisi, Italy, authorities said Wednesday that two Albanian
fishermen locked up four co-workers and sailed their boat to Italy.
   Police said the pair had requested political asylum, and the
four others who had been locked in the ship's cabin planned to go
home on their boat.

<HEAD>NRC Gives Seabrook Plant's Management Above Average Assessment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
Wednesday that the management of the Seabrook nuclear plant did an
above average job in preparing to go on line.
   The commission rated plant management's preparation ``a little
above average,'' and called the overall evaluation ``positive,''
said Karl Abraham of NRC regional headquarters in Pennsylvania.
   Seabrook began operation in August, following two decades of
court challenges and thousands of arrests in mass demonstrations.
Critics still charge that the plant's plan for evacuation in the
event of a nuclear accident is inadequate.
   Federal stock regulators last week approved acquisition of the
bankrupt facility that controls the Seabrook plant. Northeast
Utilities wants to buy Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which
holds the largest stake, 35.6 percent, in the plant.
   The NRC report said preparation for full-power licensing and
subsequent testing and commercial startup was ``careful,
conservative planning and safe, proficient accomplishment.''
   The review, covering July 1, 1989, to Oct. 31, 1990, also gave
high marks to emergency preparedness, security and safeguards, as
well as plant operations and maintenance.
   Seabrook management received good ratings in a previous NRC
review covering Sept. 1, 1987, through June 30, 1989. The NRC said
the latest review showed improvements in some areas, including
operations and safety.
   The $6.6 billion plant was completed in 1986, 10 years after
construction began. It received full power licensing in March,
reached full power in July and began commercial operation in
August. It has operated efficiently, except for two weeks in
November when mechanical problems shut down the reactor.
   ``This report will be very helpful for us as we continually
strive to improve our performance,'' said Ted Feigenbaum, president
of New Hampshire Yankee, the plant's operator.

<TEXT>
   Nancy Cruzan was driving home from work
when her 1963 Rambler ran off the road. She was found face down in
a ditch and stopped breathing for about 15 minutes.
   The accident left the vibrant young lover of children and
animals in a vegetative state for nearly eight years, and it
produced a landmark right-to-die ruling that allowed for Ms.
Cruzan's death Wednesday after her feeding tube was removed.
   Ms. Cruzan worked at a cheese plant at the time of the accident
in 1983. For six months in 1978, she worked as a teacher's aide at
a school for deaf and blind children in Joplin.
   Each day, Ms. Cruzan fed Melissa, a severely handicapped
3-year-old who suffered from an involuntary reflex that caused her
to thrust out her tongue when food touched her mouth.
   Ms. Cruzan repeatedly had to stick a tube filled with food down
the girl's throat.
   ``We agreed if we were ever in a car accident or impaired to the
point of Melissa, we would not want to live like that,'' a fellow
teacher's aide, Marianne Smith, recalled in court last month.
   Judge Charles Teel Jr. considered Mrs. Smith's testimony and
that of two other former co-workers when he granted the request of
Ms. Cruzan's parents Dec. 14 and allowed her feeding tube to be
withdrawn.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, died with her parents at her side in the
Missouri Rehabilitation Center, 12 days after the tube was removed.
   The accident that disabled Ms. Cruzan occurred about 1 a.m. Jan.
11, 1983. She was driving home from her job in Carthage when she
apparently took a curve too fast and her car overturned.
   A state trooper found Ms. Cruzan lying face down in a ditch. She
wasn't breathing. Paramedics got her breathing again, but not
before her brain had been deprived of oxygen for an estimated six
to 20 minutes, most probably for 12 to 14 minutes, court records
showed.
   Joe Cruzan, a construction worker, remembered his daughter as
``mischievous.''
   ``She was always the clown, but not a smart aleck. And yet for
all her orneriness, she was just as cute as she could be,'' he
said.
   Ms. Cruzan's mother, Joyce, who is a school secretary, said
Nancy loved all animals, especially cats. She preferred to work at
night because she hated to get out of bed in the morning, her
mother said.
   She also had a green thumb, nursing back to life sick plants
brought to her by her sisters, Christy and Donna.
   ``Nancy didn't have a long life, but it's all the life she's
going to have,'' Mrs. Cruzan said. ``She lived life to the fullest
pretty much all her life. That's more than a lot of people do.''
   ``It's so terrible to have all the good memories shaded over by
what she's like now,'' said Ms. Cruzan's sister, Christy White.
   Joe Cruzan said last week he looked forward to his daughter's
death so she finally would be at peace.
   ``Somewhere out there Nancy's still tied to this body by a
thread,'' he said. ``We are going to snip that thread and then she
will be completely free.''

<TEXT>
   Opposition parties and electoral
observers on Wednesday accused the ruling communists of widespread
vote-tampering in Serbia's first free elections in 50 years.
   The Socialists, a renamed Communist Party, crushed opposition
parties in the Dec. 9 first-round vote and in runoffs Sunday,
taking a total of 194 seats in the republic's 250-seat parliament.
   Socialist President Slobodan Milosevic was reelected with more
than 60 percent support.
   Serbia, the country's largest republic, and Montenegro, the
smallest, are the only two of Yugoslavia's six states to elect
Communist governments. In the other four states, center-right or
nationalist parties triumphed in multiparty elections this year.
   ``Because of all the irregularities that accompanied them, the
Serbian elections would not be considered legal in the West,'' said
Zoran Hodzera, a political consultant from Washington, D.C. He was
a member of a delegation of Americans and Canadians of Serbian
origin that monitored the vote.
   He said the elections ``were not really democratic.''
   To buttress his claims, Hodzera cited a sudden, 10-percent
increase in the number of registered voters on Dec. 9 and evidence
of voting without identification documents.
   He also said officials had tried to intimidate voters and showed
strong bias against opposition parties in state-run media during
the campaign.
   Miodrag Skulic, a spokesman for the Serbian Renewal Movement,
the largest opposition party, told reporters specific complaints of
irregularities had been lodged with the state electoral commission.
The movement won 19 seats.
   However, the commission has discounted as ``undocumented''
numerous opposition objections to how the vote was handled. Serbian
authorities have denied any wrongdoing.
   Serbia is at odds with the Western-minded republics of Slovenia
and Croatia, which intend to secede if Yugoslavia is not
transformed into a looser confederation. Serbia favors strong
central control.

<HEAD>Saddam Says Israel to Receive First Blow in Case of War</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told a
television interviewer that Israel is the prime mover behind the
Persian Gulf crisis and, as such, would receive the first Iraqi
blow if war breaks out.
   The remark was contained in an interview broadcast after
midnight Wednesday by the Spanish private network Tele 5, which
earlier paraphrased Saddam's threat in a news release. Saddam spoke
to the network Saturday in Baghdad.
   Saddam blamed the crisis on what he said were U.S. attempts to
preserve its international influence and on Israel's
``expansionist'' policies. He also expressed surprise at the Soviet
Union's position in the conflict, deeming it irresponsible and
unjust.
   ``We consider that the responsibility for the problems, for the
Arab conflicts, falls on Israel and the Zionists. It is they who
have pushed Bush into the dead-end street in which he now finds
himself,'' he said, referring toi President Bush.
   ``Because of that and in the case we suffer an aggression, we
consider Israel a participant ... In other words, if we must suffer
the first blow, whether at the front or here in Baghdad, and
whether or not Israel participates directly in the aggression, they
will suffer the second in Tel Aviv.''
   Saddam reiterated his position that no peaceful solution to the
conflict can emerge unless steps are taken to provide Palestinians
with a homeland.
   ``For us, the Arabs, the Palestinian cause is the main issue,
the central axis of our struggle,'' he said.
   He said the Iraqi people ``do not give the slightest
importance'' to the United Nations Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi
troops to leave Kuwait, although he said Iraq was suffering under
the U.N.-sponsored embargo.
   The U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force by U.S.
and allied troops if Iraq fails to withdraw from Kuwait, which it
invaded Aug. 2 and later annexed.
   He said Iraq was ready to fight, but left open the door to
dialogue.
   ``We advocate peace and dialogue, but if others want war and
aggression ... we are decided to crush that aggression,'' Saddam
said. ``We are not worried by threats. The most fundamental thing
for us is to preserve our spiritual integrity ... our dignity and
our sovereignty.''
   He said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation last week showed that many Soviets opposed the
government's decision to back the U.N.-sponsored embargo against
Iraq.
   ``Shevardnadze danced to (U.S. Secretary of State James) Baker's
tune. And he didn't have a clearly defined point of view. In any
case, whether it was Shevardnadze or someone else who was
responsible for Soviet foreign policy, the Soviet posture is
neither just nor responsible,'' the Iraqi leader said.
   Saddam said the United States sent troops to the gulf to
preserve power after the end of the Cold War.
   ``The decline of the Soviet Union has made the United States the
only superpower in the world. The United States needs to control
Middle East petroleum to keep excercising influence over Europe,
Japan, and probably, in a later phase, over the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
   Saddam said Arab leaders lined up against Iraq in the conflict
were not heeding their people's will.
   ``We want to see the heads roll of aggressors and traitors, and
we also want the decline of leaders who preach injustice and
practice aggression,'' he said.

   The original Broadway cast recording of
``West Side Story'' and Erroll Garner playing ``Misty'' are among
five inductees at the Hall of Fame of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences.
   The academy, which bestows the annual Grammy Awards, has
inducted pre-1958 musical pieces into its Hall of Fame since 1974.
The Grammys were first awarded in 1958.
   This year's Hall of Fame recordings are: ``Call It Stormy
Monday,'' ``Misty,'' ``Moonlight Serenade,'' ``Show Boat,'' and
``West Side Story,'' the academy announced Wednesday.
   ``Call It Stormy Monday,'' is a blues piece recorded in 1947 by
Aaron T-Bone Walker. Walker, who died in 1975, helped develop the
modern blues sound with his electric guitar style.
   ``Misty,'' was recorded by pianist Garner in 1954 and is his
most famous composition. Garner, a self-taught musician, died in
1977.
   ``Moonlight Serenade,'' was Glen Miller's theme song, and is the
second of his works to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. His
recording of ``In the Mood'' was inducted in 1983. Miller recorded
``Moonlight Serenade,'' which helped the Miller band to a top spot
among American dance bands, in 1939.
   ``Show Boat,'' recorded by Jerome Kern in 1932, was the first
album of show music recorded in the United States. The voices of
Paul Robeson and Helen Morgan are among those on the album.
   The original cast album of Leonard Bernstein's ``West Side
Story'' was produced and released in 1957. It featured Carol
Lawrence and Larry Kert.
   The recordings were chosen by the academy's 100-member Elections
Committee, which considers recommendations from the academy's 8,000
members.

   Bitter cold permeated much of the nation Wednesday and the
Pacific Northwest braced for a new blast of arctic air this
weekend.
   Sacramento, Calif., shivered through a seventh day of
record-breaking temperatures, with a low of 23 degrees.
   Other low temperature records shattered included 29 degrees
below zero in Aberdeen, S.D.; 23 below in Alamosa, Colo.; 5 in both
Albuquerque, N.M., and Amarillo, Texas; zero in Colorado Springs,
Colo.; 22 below in Dickinson, N.D.; and 25 below in Duluth, Minn.
   International Falls, Minn., had a record-breaking low of 38
below.
   The low temperature for the nation Wednesday was 45 degrees
below at both Embarrass, Minn., and Park Rapids, Minn.
   At 1 p.m. EST, temperatures remained below zero over parts of
Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana.
   It was a different story in Kodiak, Alaska, where warm west
winds pushed the temperature up to a record high of 46 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees below zero at Thief River Falls, Minn., to 80 degrees in
Key West, Fla.
   Snow was scattered Wednesday over New Hampshire, New York state,
Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Idaho, Montana,
Washington and Oregon.
   Rain fell along the Washington and Oregon coasts. Showers and
isolated thunderstorms dampened the eastern half of Texas and
western Louisiana as warm air from the Gulf of Mexico rolled over a
ridge of cooler air hovering over the area.
   A second round of snow, cold temperatures and gusty winds was
expected to reach the northern Pacific Coast this weekend.

   The Election Commission has disqualified
eight members of parliament for joining a rebel organization and
forming a rival government, state radio said Wednesday.
   The announcement said the eight were being punished for
collaborating with insurgent organizations to form a parallel
government.
   The rival administration was formed at the headquarters of the
Karen National Union rebels bordering Thailand on Dec. 18.
   Six of the deputies were from the National League for Democracy,
one was from the Party for National Democracy, and one was an
independent.
   The National League for Democracy won 392 of 485 seats in May 27
general elections, but the military government refused to
relinquish power.
   The government earlier declared the eight fugitives from arrest.
It canceled the registration of the Party for National Democracy on
Dec. 20 after its chairman, Sein Win, was declared leader of the
rival government.

   Workers in Los Angeles scurried Wednesday to find replacements
for frost-damaged flowers on Rose Parade floats and residents in
states used to milder winters continued to shiver from unusual
cold.
   Low records on Christmas Day were shattered in more than 125
U.S. cities and at least 80 deaths have been blamed on frigid cold
and floods.
   Ann Jones of Tupelo, Miss., was among thousands of people who
endured a lack of heat when a natural gas pipeline crossing the
Tombigbee River ruptured in a rush of high water over the weekend.
Heat was restored Tuesday.
   ``We have been camped out in front of the fireplace making
memories,'' she said. ``The best Christmas present was the heat and
hot water.''
   In Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday brought a record low for the
seventh consecutive day - 23 degrees. It broke the 1962 record of
26 degrees.
   Kodiak, Alaska, basked in Christmas Day's record high of 47
degrees. The previous mark was 46 degrees, set in 1984.
   Other record lows set around the nation Wednesday were:
Aberdeen, S.D., 29 degrees below zero; Albuquerque, N.M., 5
degrees; and Amarillo, Texas, 5 degrees, which was a shade colder
than the 6 degree record set in 1894.
   The lowest recorded temperature was 45 degrees below zero in
Embarrass, Minn.
   Snow covered much of New England and upper New York, the
Midwest, the Rocky Mountain states and down in east Texas and
Western Louisiana.
   Wind machines, orchard heaters and sprinklers deployed to fight
the freeze couldn't save much of California's orange, lemon,
avocado and strawberry crops.
   Leaves on avocado trees were limp, their edges dried to a frosty
crisp. The usually waxy green leaves on lemon trees turned gold and
curled.
   Worst off are the orchards of navel oranges, said Bob Krauter of
the California Farm Bureau Federation. He had no dollar estimate on
the damage.
   The state reported that California's 1989-90 navel orange crop
was valued at $248 million. California Citrus Mutual, a growers'
organization, estimated 80 percent of the current crop was still on
the trees when frost hit. Since that was wiped out, the loss could
reach $200 million.
   The cold hindered builders in a hurry to complete Rose Parade
floats. Volunteers busily attached corn husks, dried straw flowers
and onion seeds while float builders searched for replacements for
frost-damaged marigolds, lavenders and irises.
   ``The weather has us scurrying, but that's what this business is
all about,'' said Rick Chapman, owner of Azusa's Festival
Artists-Floatmasters Inc. ``It hasn't been this cold since 1981.''
   The bad news on Northern California's cold front is drawing
attention from a much bigger problem - drought.
   ``Our reservoirs, statewide, are at about 50 percent of the
historical average and 30 percent of capacity,'' said Geno Young of
the state Department of Water Resources.
   The National Weather Service predicted another burst of winter
this weekend for the Northern Pacific coast. Frost was expected as
far south as San Diego early next week.

   Gunmen fired at police guarding
a road checkpoint early Thursday, 20 minutes after the end of a
three-day Christmas cease-fire ordered by the IRA.
   Police headquarters at Belfast said in a statement that police
at Annathmartin checkpoint, 70 miles west of Belfast, returned the
fire but nobody was reported injured on either side.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Police said the shooting happened 20 minutes into Thursday. The
IRA cease-fire began at midnight Sunday and ended at midnight
Wednesday. Police said no attacks were recorded in Northern Ireland
throughout the IRA cease-fire.

   The faithful who gathered at Holy Family Roman
Catholic Church hoped it wouldn't be the last Christmas celebrated
in the deteriorating church, one of the few buildings to survive
the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.
   Parishioners need to raise $125,000 more by New Year's Eve to
save the 130-year-old Victorian Gothic church, said Dick Barry, a
spokesman for the Holy Family Preservation Society.
   ``We're going to make our goal,'' the Rev. George Lane said
Monday. ``Our motto is `Say prayers and send money.'''
   About 20 parishioners braved 10-degree temperatures to gather on
the church steps Wednesday night for the first candlelight rosary
service to be held one hour a day for five days.
   The Society of Jesus, which owns the church, has threatened to
tear it down and sell the property unless the parish can raise $1
million of a $3 million repair bill by the deadline.
   Construction on the church began in 1857. By 1860, it was the
third-largest church in the United States. Its 226-foot bell tower
was the tallest structure in Chicago and its stained glass windows
were the first installed in the city.
   When fire broke out in October 1871 and devastated the city,
Holy Family, only five blocks from where the fire began, was
unharmed. It was one of only five public buildings spared by the
fire.
   ``The Rev. Arnold Damen, Jesuit founder of the parish, vowed
that if the church was spared, seven lights would burn perpetually
at the church's shrine to Our Lady of Perpetual Help,'' Lane said.
   ``The seven lights, now electrified, still burn in the church
today, even though the main section of the building has been closed
for six years.''
   The congregation has been using the side chapel since falling
plaster made the main room unusable. But the main nave is still
structurally sound and seats more than 1,200, so church officials
would like to reopen it after repairs.
   Barry said the church needs repairs to its slate roof and its
copper sheeting, as well as work on its downspouts and interior
plaster.
   ``The first $1 million would go for that, and we'd use the rest
for less urgent things, like renovating the interior and adding
modern improvements,'' he said.
   Barry said generous former parishioners and alumni of the
adjoining St. Ignatius College Prep, one of the city's oldest and
most prestigious Roman Catholic high schools, helped them near
their goal.
   ``One auto dealer from the suburbs, a graduate of St. Ignatius,
gave us $50,000 last week,'' he said. ``Another graduate, who has a
large Italian restaurant, threw banquets for us and gave us all the
proceeds.''
   If the parish makes the deadline for raising the first $1
million, it then will have some breathing room to come up with the
rest of the money.
   Barry said the Jesuits have pledged a $750,000 maintenance fund,
and a union has offered to do $50,000 worth of electrical work for
free.

Cabin</HEAD>

   The handgun used to kill two women who
were slain when they surprised two intruders at a remote mountain
cabin apparently was stolen from a nearby cabin, authorities said
Wednesday.
   Several cabins were burglarized before Beth Harmon Tidwell
Potts, 76, and her daughter, Kaye Tidwell Tiede, 49, were killed
Saturday, Summit County Sheriff Fred Eley said.
   Mrs. Tiede's husband, Rolf Tiede, 51, was shot in the face
during the confrontation and has been released from a hospital. The
couple's two daughters, age 16 and 20, were held hostage but were
not harmed.
   The family, from Humble, Texas, planned to spend the holidays at
the cabin.
   Most items stolen from the unspecified number of cabins in the
Beaver Springs subdivision 45 miles east of Salt Lake City have
been recovered, said Eley.
   On the day of the slayings, authorities arrested Von Lester
Taylor, 25, and Edward Steven Deli, 21, who walked away from a
halfway house for prison parolees Dec. 14.
   The men were charged with two counts each of first-degree
murder, two count of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of
aggravated kidnapping and other felonies.
   They were held without bond pending a Jan. 8 preliminary
hearing.

   Irvin Stewart, a former president of West
Virgina University and top government research executive in World
War II, is dead at age 91.
   Stewart died Monday at his Washington home. He had suffered a
series of strokes.
   A lawyer, Stewart first worked in Washington in 1926 as an
assistant solicitor at the State Department. His various Washington
positions over the years included service, on loan from the State
Department, on the staff of Rep. Sam Rayburn, D-Texas, where he
helped draft the 1934 Communications Act.
   That legislation established the Federal Communications
Commission and still guides federal telecommunications policy.
   In World War II, Stewart was executive secretary of the Office
of Scientific Research and Development, the agency that guided
development of the atomic bomb.
   He was president of West Virginia University from 1946 to 1958,
and taught law there until retirement in 1967.
   Stewart is survived by his wife, Florence, and a son.

   The U.S. population stood at 249,632,692 as of
the 1990 census, the government said Wednesday in a numerical
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland.
   California, the nation's largest state, added more than 6
million people in the decade, a 26.1 percent increase to 29,839,250
people.
   Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down
2.9 percent from 1980.
   Nevada was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms,
and Florida and Arizona each grew by more than one-third as
millions of Americans flocked to the sunshine.
   West Virginia was the largest loser in percentage terms.
   In all, the population increased by 10.2 percent from the
226,504,825 people counted in the 1980 census, below the 11.4
percent population growth recorded from 1970 to 1980, and the 13.4
percent rate from 1960 to 1970.
   The information was contained in the Census Bureau's first
release of ``final figures'' - really tentative final figures -
from the 1990 count. The information will be used for everything
from readjusting the size of each state's congressional delegation
to parcelling out federal aid.
   In political terms, the population shifts will give California
seven new House seats, and add lawmakers to seven other states.
Thirteen states will lose representation.
   Because of the importance of the population estimates, some
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies, and a final
count isn't expected until next summer.
   The cost of the 1990 census, from planning begun in 1984 to a
final release of data in 1993, is estimated at $2.6 billion by the
bureau.
   Still locked in Census Bureau computers - to be doled out over
the next several years - is a wealth of information about age,
race, living conditions and other details of America near the turn
of the century.
   Besides Wyoming, four other states lost population. The biggest
percentage loser was West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6
percent to 1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa,
down 4.3 percent, and and North Dakota, down 1.7 percent. The
District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5 percent.
   The sharpest gainer in percentage terms was Nevada. That state's
population grew by 50.7 percent to 1,206,152. Besides California,
other states with gains of more than 25 percent were Florida, up
33.4 percent; Arizona, up 35.3 percent; and Alaska, up 37.4
percent.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. By contrast, the East North
Central states grew a bare 1.1 percent, and the West North Central
states, 3.1 percent.
   Some regions went against the broader trend. New England, which
had a boom in high-tech industry during the 1980s, grew by 7.2
percent. The East South Central states grew only 3.9 percent.
   Because of the high financial and political stakes, the census
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw
continued sharp scrutiny.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   The final national population total was nearly 4 million people
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier
this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has until July 1991, to
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a
statistically determined undercount of minorities. An adjustment
would increase political representation of areas with a high
percentage of minorities, and lower that of other areas.
   California will gain seven seats, giving it 52 in the 435-member
House. Florida will gain four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia,
North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   New York will lose three seats; Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, two seats each; and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia,
one seat each.
   The 1990 census for the first time counted some Americans living
abroad. The total included 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents.
   The comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people
living within the United States.
   The Census Bureau on Wednesday released two sets of 1980
numbers. The 226,504,825 figure used by the bureau for comparison
with the 1990 national total was released in December 1980 but was
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems. The adjusted
figure was 226,545,805.
   The 1990 population count was nearly 64 times the 3,929,214
counted in 1790, the first census in the nation's history. By 1900,
the population had reached 76,212,168.
   In 1950, the first census after World War II, the population was
151,325,798.
   In January, the Census Bureau will begin sending information on
small areas, in some cases the size of a city block, to state
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and
legislative boundaries.
   That process will be completed by April 1.
   The bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data
until after the decision on adjusting the figures.

   A late Christmas card from your
procrastinating Uncle Harold won't be the only thing missing from
your mailbox today. Your annual greetings from the Internal Revenue
Service won't be in the mail either.
   The IRS, after years of sending its tax packages out on the day
following Christmas, has decided to give taxpayers a brief
reprieve.
   This year, the forms will go out on Friday, three days following
Christmas.
   ``We want to move it away from the Christmas holiday to allow
folks to enjoy that period of the year as long as they possibly can
before we throw a wet blanket on them,'' said Arthur Altman,

   CHICAGO (AP) - School suicide-prevention programs for teen-agers
can do some youngsters more harm than good, researchers said today.
   Columbia University researchers said they found little evidence
that such programs reduced suicides or suicide attempts, according
to a study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association,
   ``There was some evidence of unwanted effects'' on teen-agers
who have attempted suicide, researchers from Columbia's medical
school.
   Discussing the topic openly often stirred up suicidal feelings,
subjects of the study said. Of those who had tried to kill
themselves before taking part in school counseling, 26.7 percent
thought the programs increase the chances that youths will attempt
suicide.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Dismissing demands that he stand aside, Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr. says he will keep ``plugging away'' as

   Riegle intends to convene hearings early next year on providing
money for the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency selling off assets
of defunct thrifts, and he has prepared legislation to rescue the
government fund that guarantees bank customers' deposits.
   He likely will call Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
testify in February - just the type of setting that attracts heavy
media coverage and gives lawmakers a forum for expressing concern
about the victims of a slowing economy.
   But while the Michigan Democrat busies himself for work
overseeing an industry in financial distress, he also must defend
his own integrity against fresh questions in the heavily publicized
Keating Five hearings - and fend off Republican calls to relinquish
his committee chairmanship.

<HEAD>Editors Vote Gulf Crisis Top Story of 1990 By Overwhelming Margin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the heart-stopping standoff that
ensued in the Persian Gulf was by far the top news story of 1990,
according to a poll of Associated Press news editors and broadcast
news directors.
   The Gulf crisis received 2,506 points to finish well ahead of
the news story that placed second, the reunification of Germany.
That story got 1,460 points in voting by 327 editors and news
directors.
   The No. 3 story also unfolded abroad - the economic and
political reforms that have racked the Soviet Union.
   The first domestic story to make the list was the continuing
savings and loan debacle, which finished fourth.
   Finishing fifth was the warming of relations between the two
superpowers, followed by Congress' difficulties with the 1991
budget; America's economic downturn; developments in Eastern
Europe; Panama President Manuel Noriega's surrender and
preparations to prosecute him; and the end of the Margaret Thatcher
era in Britain.
   The top 10 stories:
   1. When Saddam Hussein's Iraqi troops overran the tiny emirate
of Kuwait in the pre-dawn hours of Aug. 2, they set in motion a
dizzying sequence of dangerous events: a United Nations-ordered
embargo against Iraq; a buildup of American and other forces in the
region; the taking of foreign hostages as human shields for Iraqi
military sites, and their later release.
   By September's end, the price of oil reached $40 a barrel,
nearly double what it had been before the invasion.
   On Nov. 29 the U.N. Security Council voted to give Iraq until
Jan. 15 to pull out of Kuwait or face a possible military strike.
The world is waiting.
   2. East and West Germany became one nation again on Oct. 3,
ending a division that began at the end of World War II.
   Reunification had been an impossible dream just a year before -
but that was before East German protests for democratic freedoms at
the end of 1989 brought down Berlin Wall, since 1961 the Cold War's
most palpable symbol.
   Free elections were held in East Germany in the spring of 1990
and the communists were sent packing. The Soviet Union accepted
NATO membership for the united Germany, removing the last serious
obstacle.
   3. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's ambitious program of
economic and political reforms foundered in 1990. Although
Gorbachev won a new five-year term as president and tightened his
control over the Communist Party, his nation was torn apart by
ethnic unrest, rebellious republics, disgruntled hardliners and
shortages of bread, sugar, meat, cigarettes and other goods.
   4. The S&amp;L mess got messier in 1990, and the tab to U.S.
taxpayers was revised upwards to $500 billion over 30 years. The $2
billion failure of Charles Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan,
the biggest bailout yet, came to symbolize the troubles of hundreds
of thrifts.
   Keating, who faces federal fraud charges accusing him of
misleading investors on the safety of junk bonds, made $1.3 million
in political contributions to five senators who intervened on his
behalf with thrift regulators. The Senate Ethics Committee held
hearings on the five: Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   A federal judge found the president's son Neil guilty of
conflict of interest for failing to disclose business ties with
developers in his role as director of the failed Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association.
   5. Gorbachev may have faced mounting headaches at home, but
relations with the United States were never warmer. Bush and
Gorbachev, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for easing international
tensions, met three times during the year. The first meeting was in
Washington to sign chemical weapons agreements; the second was a
one-day summit in Helsinki, Finland, to discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The third meeting was in Paris in November for the 34-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Its highlight was
the signing of a far-reaching conventional arms control agreement
by leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and
Warsaw Pact nations.
   6. After five months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations,
Congress and Bush cobbled together a 1991 budget package in
October. In addition to spending cuts, the $250 billion deficit
reduction package provided for tax increases, belying the
president's most popular pledge: ``Read my lips - no new taxes.''
Republicans campaigning for re-election felt betrayed.
   7. Bush said the nation's economy was in a ``serious slowdown,''
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan used the phrase
``meaningful downturn,'' but virtually everybody else was calling
what was happening in the last half of 1990 a recession.
   The statistics were mostly bad: November's unemployment rate
jumped to a three-year high of 5.9 percent. Single-family housing
starts fell to levels unmatched since the 1981-82 recession. The
October trade deficit took an unexpected leap to $11.6 billion in
October, the worst monthly trade gap in 2{ years. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average, which had flirted with 3,000 in July, was some
400 points lower in December.
   In a bid to stimulate the economy, the Fed cut its discount rate
- the interest it charges on loans to member banks - for the first
time since 1986.
   8. Soviet troops began pulling out of Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and East Germany after non-communist governments came to
power in those nations for the first time since World War II. But
economic difficulties and ethnic tensions, kept under wraps during
communist rule, flared under looser regimes and threatened the
fledgling democracies.
   In Poland, Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa was elected president
in a landslide victory in December.
   Romanians clashed with Hungarians in disputed areas of Romania,
and separatist demands threatened to dissolve Yugoslavia. In
Albania, the last bastion of Stalinist rule, the government
formally recognized the first opposition party in decades and
scheduled elections for early 1991. The same week, more than 150
people were tried for anti-government acts after protesters burned
and ransacked buildings in four provinces.
   9. On Jan. 3, Panamanian President Manuel Noriega stepped out of
the Vatican mission where he had taken refuge and surrendered to
U.S. authorities. He was brought to Florida and charged with
accepting $4.6 million in bribes to turn Panama into a way station
for Colombian drug traffickers.
   Noriega had been scheduled to go to trial this January, but his
attorneys recently told a federal judge they will not be ready for
trial until June.
   10. Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady who ruled Britain longer
than anyone else this century, bowed out.
   In 11{ years as prime minister she dismantled Britain's version
of socialism, crushed obstructive labor unions and led a military
victory against Argentina in the Falkland Islands.
   However, her increasingly isolationist role in European
Community policies and her deeply unpopular poll tax cost her the
support of her Conservative Party. In November she was succeeded by
her handpicked successor, John Major.

   On his deathbed at Georgetown Hospital,
behind the closed door of room C6316, Central Intelligence Agency
director William J. Casey whispered two words.
   Washington Post investigative legend Bob Woodward, according to
his own account, was bent over the dying chief, asking if and why
Casey had participated in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``I believed,'' Casey replied.
   So, too, apparently, did the executive producers of a new ABC
series about the CIA called ``Under Cover,'' debuting Jan. 7.
   Belief in what, however - like Casey's cryptic answer - is not
really clear.
   That CIA agents are not all evil spies plotting to overthrow
banana republics in far-flung corners of the world? That, like John
Q. Public, said agents are fathers, mothers, Little League
supporters and also concerned about the office dental plan?
   That's part of it. Left to the imagination in the two-hour pilot
of ``Under Cover'' is why its characters do what they do and if
they truly believe in the agency they work for.
   Co-executive producer William Broyles Jr., former editor in
chief of Newsweek, founding editor of Texas Monthly, Vietnam
veteran and co-creator of ABC's ``China Beach,'' said the lead
characters of ``Under Cover'' are ``trying to do the right thing in
a sometimes difficult and unethical situation.
   ``These agents, like soldiers, are often the foot soldiers of
agents and policies that they disagree with,'' Broyles said in a
recent interview at his Warner Bros. office.
   The makers of ``Under Cover'' find themselves in a somewhat
similar and awkward position. It is Broyles and John Sacret Young
who created the new series, as well as ``China Beach.''
   And it is ``China Beach'' that ``Under Cover'' is replacing.
   ``There's an irony in it that's certainly not lost on me,'' said
Broyles.
   The acclaimed Vietnam War series ``China Beach'' is going on
hiatus, the victim of three different time period changes in as
many seasons and a drop in viewership.
   Whether ``China Beach'' will be renewed is doubtful.
   Young is equally doubtful about the success of ``Under Cover.''
   ``I can't imagine that it will succeed,'' he said.
   The reason being its time period of 9 p.m. Saturdays, an hour
not known for attracting huge numbers of network viewers. Many of
those who do tune in are watching NBC's successful ``Golden Girls''
comedy series.
   Young calls ``Under Cover'' a program about ``how a man thinks
he's doing a job and it's really affecting his life. What's
happening is getting under the skin.''
   International espionage will do that to a person. Especially
when bullets, needles and torture are involved.
   ``You don't want to whitewash the CIA,'' Young said. ``You tread
a fine line, which creates a horrible and horrid situation.''
   Imagine the series' story meetings. What to do about the CIA's
historic involvement in foreign affairs? Chile, for example. Fidel
Castro. Mining Nicaraguan harbors. The troublesome problem of
overthrowing foreign leaders deemed to be unfriendly.
   The story line of ``Under Cover'' concerns husband-and-wife spy
team Dylan and Kate Del'Amico (Anthony John Denison and Linda Purl)
who are anxious to put down roots, live in the suburbs, go to
Little League games and otherwise live the American dream.
   Wife Kate soured on ``the company'' a while back and no longer
spies. Husband Dylan, while professing his desire for an agency
desk job, ends up in the Soviet Union on a mission to save glasnost
and becomes part of a convoluted double-agent scenario that leaves
certain members of the agency unsure of whether Dylan works for
them or the KGB.
   Meanwhile, back at the agency, the yuppies are threatening to
take over with their flyover satellite pictures and
technology-driven spying.
   Dylan and Kate's boss, Stewart Merriman, runs around imparting
words of wisdom such as ``We're the only thing between order and
chaos'' and ``In our business, things are not always what they
seem.''
   He should try dropping in on ``Twin Peaks,'' the bizarre
nighttime soap opera that follows ``Under Cover.''
   Over there, they've got this gaunt-looking giant who appears in
visions and says ``The owls are not what they seem.''

<HEAD>Proving That People Will Put Up With a Lot for a Bargain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LeROY TILLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In increasing numbers, American consumers are
shunning the glittery malls and choosing to shop in huge, drab
buildings where service is almost a missing element.
   But prices are lower in warehouse purchasing clubs. The stocks
are huge. And the economy is in the doldrums. The combination is
proving irresistible; people will put up with a lot for a bargain.
   So many people are willing to pay the $25 membership fee that
entitles them to go to the warehouse clubs and purchase everything
from luggage to lettuce in a single trip.
   ``The service isn't great,'' says Marlene Green of Randallstown,
Md., interviewed during a shopping trip in a warehouse club outside
of Washington, ``but I've shopped at the warehouse for so long. I'm
a veteran. I generally know where everything is and once you can
figure that out. it's easy.
   ``The prices are so low, that I'm willing to trade service to
save money.''
   Charles Steinbreuck, president and chief executive officer of
the Pace Membership Warehouse chain based in Englewood, Colo., says
one reason for the success of the format is that consumers are
tired of paying ``hidden costs'' of dealing with major retailers.
   ``Lower overhead costs and not having to pay for mass media
advertising campaigns allows (us) competitive advantages over
traditional retailers,'' he says.
   ``By doing direct mailings to our individual members and the
small businesses we serve, there's no need to pass along to
consumers the costs of trying to appeal to the masses.''
   Gerry Warren of Piscataway, Md., who joined Pace in 1985, says
he sees the difference in the nearly wholesale prices offered by
the warehouses as compared to shopping at grocery store chains.
   ``This really surprised me ... the quality of the merchandise
offered by the warehouse. I thought it was going to be one of those
deals where cheap stuff is just marked down to get rid of it,'' he
says.
   ``But I can tell you, the quality is as good or better than I
can get (elsewhere) and it's saved me a lot of money in the past
five years.''
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with The Futures Group in
Washington, says when the nation's economy goes into a decline, no
matter how brief, consumers go where they can get the most for
their money.
   ``When the economy gets soft, usually consumers are willing to
trade down in price, as long as there's not much of a drop in
quality,'' Ms. Shaber says.
   ``You can't just be cheap, you have to have something of value
to offer. You have to have popular products available, the
warehouse has to have a neat, professional appearance and it has to
be convenient,'' she said.
   Sonyia Soper, a shopper at the Pace warehouse in Laurel, Md.,
says she first shopped at the outlet last year and now makes the
majority of her purchases there.
   ``The prices are the main inducement. ... I can buy more for
less money than going around the corner to Laurel Centre Mall. They
have to pay for all of the glitz associated with being in a mall,
and who gets stuck with the bill, you (shoppers) do,'' she says.
   Pace opened its first warehouse store in Denver in 1983 and
currently has 62 outlets nationwide. It has 3 million members, who
are charged $25 annually, and serves about 800,000 small
businesses.
   The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Kmart Corp., will
do a projected $2.5 bilion in sales this year.
   Pace and the San Diego, Calif.-based Price Club, whose
membership dues are also $25 a year, are the front-runners in the
effort to capture dollars that are usually spent at supermarkets,
department stores and specialty shops.
   The popularity of the warehouse stores, which started in the
West, is rapidly spreading to the heavily industrialized Northeast.
   Ms. Shaber says since that is where the nationwide economic
slowdown is being most severely felt, warehouse stores are
targeting the region for growth.
   ``Whenever and wherever money gets tight, consumers look for an
alternative to mainstream markets for goods and services,'' she
says.
   ``We're seeing the backlash from the early 1980s when brand
names were so strong that they squeezed out generic brands from the
marketplace. That cycle has run its course and people now want more
purchasing power for their money.''
   Sales at the warehouse clubs have increased substantially in the
past six years. Prices are usually 20 percent to 40 percent below
what is charged by traditional retailers.
   Costs are lower because of the size of the stores, usually about
100,000 square feet, because they do not permit credit card
purchases and they offer minimal customer assistance.
   Steinbreuck says the economic downturn is a factor in the recent
popularity of the warehouse stores. Another is their convenience.
   ``We sell food - fresh and frozen and meats. We sell electronic
equipment and appliances. we sell automotive supplies. We offer
something that most retailers lack - the ability to offer several
different categories of merchandise in one location, which means
that our customers can shop at their leisure and save gasoline.''

<HEAD>Turning Supply and Demand On Its Head</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people who claim to know how free markets
work are doing things that make you wonder, such as raising their
rates in an attempt to offset declines in business.
   Basic economics texts say that to do so is the road to ruin, but
don't try telling that to bankers and many other financial
institutions executives who already have decided to put the theory
through another test.
   They wouldn't be the first to try. For years, automobile
companies tried to cover higher costs by higher prices, only to be
forced by lagging sales into rebating some of the increases. The
steel industry tried it before them.
   The Wall Street Journal recently suggested that higher costs
were behind its 50 percent price increase, drawing from Fortune
Magazine a commentary on the importance of reading the Journal's
own free-market editorials. But the Journal isn't the only
publication by a long shot that is taking the higher price course.
It's happening throughout the country.
   With business falling, you might think that financial
institutions might consider lowering some fees for services, but
throughout the industry there are plans to raise them instead.
Citibank raised several fees 25 percent or more.
   Savings institutions are working their way through an absolute
financial debacle, one that has swallowed up hundreds of outlets
and scared away customers of many who survive. But they too are
doing it.
   ``Instituting or increasing fees for services can better define
relationships with customers,'' according to ``Savings
Institutions,'' published for members of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
   According to an article, to boost fee income ``adds up in
dollars - and sense.'' Traditional fees involve services such as
safe-deposit boxes, checks returned for insufficient funds,
stop-payment requests, money transfers ...
   Fees for many of these are sure to go up, but it is likely that
some not-so-common fees also will head in that direction. In
addition, you may find that local branch managers will less apt to
waive fees.
   That latter practice, says Michael Wilson, a researcher for the
league, is often a key factor in the poor performance of some
branches. In the new thinking, imposition of the fees may rid the
branch of unprofitable customers.
   The ``Savings Institutions'' article describes what it indicates
is a highly profitable money-raiser used by one bank: it circulates
a magazine to big-balance customers and sells advertising in it.
That's not all.
   More important, it says, is ``the real gravy,'' which comes in
the form of commissions paid by a travel agency on every cruise
advertised in the magazine and booked by a bank customer.
   Will such practices work? Theoretically, they aren't likely to
succeed over a long period of time if customers feel the services
offered aren't worth the price or are available at a better price
from a competing institution.
   However, in a crisis - and that is how many in the business view
their condition - they may help an institution to survive.
Securities brokers did it, you may recall, and they survived for a
while. But with institutional business declining, many are
rethinking policies and seeking to attract individuals.
   One of the key questions, of course, is whether the institutions
will offer improved services, or simply try to squeeze more money
out of the existing level of service, or perhaps even allow it to
decline.
   Customers reaction will have something to say about it too. Will
customers better appreciate the services offered when they have to
pay for them? Or, as could very well happen, will they tend to feel
exploited?
   If you continue to believe that the laws of the market place, of
supply and demand, haven't been rescinded, then you must still
believe the practices may be a short-term phenomenon, and that
price competition will return.

<HEAD>Toyota Tercel: Upgraded From Basic Econobox</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1991 Toyota Tercel 2-door Deluxe is not your basic econobox.
   It has a remarkaby smooth-shifting five-speed manual
transmission.
   It has contemporary, rounded exterior styling and clean, modern
interior.
   And it doesn't have a hatchback sibling. For 1991, Toyota
eliminated the hatchback design that's standard fare at the low end
of the car market and decided to offer the Tercel in upscale, 2-and
4-door sedan models that have trunks.
   ``We want to keep Toyota buyers for the long haul, so we don't
punish them in their first experience with us,'' said Bob McCurry,
Toyota executive vice president.
   The Tercel's starting price of $6,488 also is noteworthy. It's
unchanged from the previous model year and makes the new Tercel the
lowest price car with a trunk in America. It compares with the
$6,995 Honda Civic 3-door, the $7,999 Nissan Sentra and the $6,597
Daihatsu Charade 3-door.
   The AP's test Tercel, a 2-door with a base price of $7,798,
performed well. It wasn't a barn burner, what with its 1.5-liter,
in-line, 12-valve, four-cylinder engine capable of producing 82
horsepower at 5,200 rpm. I also had to really push the clutch to
the floor so the key would activate the ignition.
   But the car does accelerate faster than the previous Tercel
model, and the fuel economy of 29 miles per gallon in the city and
35 mpg on the highway was appreciated. It was a pleasure, too, to
note the fine mating of the transmission with the engine. I rarely
felt a jerk as I shifted gears.
   There was some road noise but not as much as might be expected.
Toyota added extra sound-deadening material that's also used on the
Camry and worked to minimize vibration.
   The car's suspension - MacPherson strut in front and a torsion
beam in back - was decent and took bumps and turns quite well.
   Fit and finish were superb. Toyota has reduced the size of body
panel gaps on the exterior.
   The interior was Spartan, though not necessarily cheap-looking.
Ventilation ducts were modern and round and could be turned easily
and directed for maximum effect. Gauges were large and easy to
read.
   As expected, the car's equipment was basic. The vehicle did not
have power windows, power locks, a clock, tilt steering or a remote
trunk lid release, and the rear windows do not open. The trunk
floor had a vinyl cover, but there was nothing to cover the bare
metal on the interior trunk sides.
   The floor mats were a $55 option, and power steering - a real
help in tight turns in parking lots - cost $250.
   The car had seat belts for five, but the middle person in back
sits up quite high on an awkward, though cushioned, resting spot.
   I was glad to see that legroom in back was OK if the front seats
are up a ways, but my knees were pushed into the seatbacks when the
seats were all the way back on their tracks. Toyota said the new
Tercel has 9 percent more interior space than its predecessor, with
an average of 1 inch added to each interior dimension.
   The automaker looks to sell 130,000 of the 1991 Tercels, which
were introduced in November. That would be up from approximately
100,000 for the 1990 model Tercel.
   The Tercel has been in the United States since 1980 and has
averaged about 100,000 sales a year, spokesman Jim Fewel said.
   Tercel buyers traditionally have been young, single and female.
Seventy percent of Tercel buyers are women, with a median age of
31, Fewel said. Thirty-five percent are married, and 54 percent are
college graduates. Median income is in the upper $20,000s, he said.
   With the exception of the 1987 model, Tercels have ranked better
than average or much better than average since the 1984 model year,
according to Consumer Reports magazine's trouble reports from
owners. The 1987 Tercel ranked average.

<HEAD>Robertson, Calling Believers Into Politics, Sees Threat to Israel</HEAD>

   Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, now off the
campaign trail but still plugging for believers' engagement with
political issues, worries the Persian Gulf crisis could be turned
against Israel.
   He says Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ``has set the machinery in
motion'' by which a world military alliance and Arab nations
eventually might ``isolate Israel and spark cataclysmic events.''
   If tha happens, it would bring ``some heavenly intervention to
protect Israel,'' Robertson said in an interview. ``Certainly
events are marching in that direction and very rapidly.''
   He doesn't offer any timetable or specific scenario for such
convulsions, as do some end-of-time sifters of biblical clues. But
as a firm backer of Israel's nationhood, he does see hints of it in
the present turmoil.
   Robertson, in a wide-ranging conversation, also foresaw a
sharpening ``struggle for the pinacles of power'' in this country -
in government, the courts, schools and news media - and predicted
religious values would regain ascendancy.
   ``It's a multifaceted struggle, but the people of faith are
going to prevail,'' he said. ``A profound spiritual awakening is
coming in this country in this decade.''
   He elaborates his views in a new book, ``The New Millennium,''
published by Word Publishing of Irving, Texas, and it foresees a
conflict between secularism and Judeo-Christian standards.
   Similar themes threaded his unsuccessful 1988 campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination and he said that campaign
accomplished a goal even though he didn't win.
   ``My main purpose was not to see me elected, but to get
Christians involved in the public arena and in politics. And
they're in there,'' he said.
   ``I found there is an enormous reservoir of pro-family,
pro-Christian values in this country. These people are in it for
the long haul. ... Within the next 10 years they may be the most
powerful political force in America.
   Robertson, 60, is back as president of his financially rebounded
Christian Broadcasting Network and chancellor of its affiliated
graduate school, Regent University at Virginia Beach, Va.
   He brushes aside the idea of another presidential bid.
Chuckling, he said, ``I'm so glad that Bush got handed the deficit,
the savings-and-loan crisis and the Middle East, I don't know what
to do.''
   He said he has ``no plans whatever'' to run again. But earlier
this year, he set up a national voter-education organization, the
Christian Coalition, to alert grass-roots supporters to issues.
   It has about 50,000 participants so far, he said. ``They're
going to make a big contribution. They're capable, intelligent, and
make tremendous political operatives when they care to do so. It'll
be for the good of the country.''
   In his book, he predicts that in this decade, a ``fierce,
intense and sometimes ugly battle is going to be waged to seize the
control points of society away from the forces of anti-Christian
secularism.''
   ``After a period of intense struggle, the believers will stand
firmly astride the fallen and crumbling ruins of the secular
colossus,'' he says.
   He also predicts that ``we are entering the age of the
supernatural,'' a colliding amalgam of all sorts of cults, esoteric
``lords and masters,'' ``New Age counterfeits,'' followers of the
occult and even Satanism.
   But, he says, these will be countered by a ``groundswell of
Christian renewal all over the world'' that will reverse
smothering, irreligious secularism.
   He sharply criticizes the courts, saying they have ``legislated
Judeo-Christian values out of American life,'' and the educational
system, saying it has caused the ``dumbing of America.''
   ``Generations have been so well trained to be so open minded,
their minds are essentially empty,'' he writes.
   Anti-religious attitudes dominate the movies, television and
print media, he says. But like communism, he says, ``secular
humanism has failed . ... It is a bankrupt system, without moral
guidelines or reliable safeguards to protect the people from its
own corruptions.''
   Robertson stressed similar points in the interview. He said the
religious non-establishment clause in the constitution ``has been
used for the establishment of everything else,'' chiefly ``a
secularistic religion'' that excludes Judeo-Christianity.
   He blames the abandonment of America's religious roots for the
most serious problems of the country - drug abuse, crime, child
abuse, wife battering, the deficit and financial scandals.
   ``It's like taking the foundation from under a skyscraper. The
whole thing comes tumbling down,'' he said.
   Robertson, relaxed, warm, with his ready smile, keeps in shape
jogging, playing tennis and horseback riding. A one-time Golden
Gloves boxer, he took time out this fall at the invitation of boxer
Evander Holyfield to see him win the world's heavyweight boxing
championship in Las Vegas.
   He's kept busy administering operations with revenues of $90
million a year, $70 million of it in donations (up from a low of
$58 million in 1988) and more than 1,100 employees. He also is host
of CBN's centerpiece, 90-minute talk show, ``The 700 Club,'' which
is carried on 223 TV stations and cable systems reaching 52 million
households.
   ``People are saying let's get back to our roots,'' he said.
``We've got to get back to our Judeo-Christian principles and
restore the values that we've given up. Then we've got to roll up
our sleeves and go to work to start rebuilding this country and the
world.''

   Betty Carter has been bopping around as a jazz
singer for 42 years, but she isn't tired of it.
   ``Performing live brings something out of you that the recording
studio doesn't,'' she says.
   In fact, her new album, ``Droppin' Things,'' on Verve Records,
was recorded live at the Bottom Line here on two nights in May. Her
last album, ``Look What I Got!'', won a Grammy Award for best
female jazz vocal performance in 1988.
   Carter, 60, feels it's important for a singer to work with new
material and not get locked into an unchanging repertoire.
   ```Why Him' is an Alan Jay Lerner song I heard when they were
giving him a tribute on TV. I decided to find the lyrics and do the
song,'' she said of her new album. ```Thirty Years' is a brand-new
song. `Droppin' Things' is very new. `Open the Door' I recorded
before but never like this.'' She wrote those three.
   One of the tracks on the album is ``Star Dust,'' combined with
``Memories of You.'' But, Carter said, ``I never sang `Star Dust'
before. I only sang `Memories' once or twice.''
   Carter is known for daring improvisations and unusual approaches
to songs. ``The more you do a song the more you learn about the
tune and your concept of the tune. Then I'm free; then I just go
any way I want to go and can go with it musically,'' she said.
   But she decided not to play around too much on the new album.
``At least you can recognize it,'' she said. ``Most people want to
recognize `Star Dust.'''
   Carter is backed up by Marc Cary on piano, Duane Burno on bass
and Gregory Hutchinson on drums. ``They're 20, 20 and 23,'' she
said. ``My musicians are getting younger and younger. Maybe 15
years ago I had a hard time finding musicians. Now there are a lot
of them out there who want to play acoustic instruments and work
with me.''
   They went to Japan in October, returned for some American gigs
in November and probably will spend much of next year in Europe.
``I love performing. I know how spontaneous it is for me to do my
work. Working keeps me alive,'' Carter said.
   A snatch of conversation overheard on the radio led her to
rework the lyrics for ``Jumps,'' a song she wrote 12 years ago. Her
trio liked ``Jumps,'' so when they went to Europe in March, she
worked on more lyrics.
   ``The music was very abstract,'' she said. ``Once these young
kids showed me their enthusiasm for the tune, I said OK, I'm going
to develop it. I'd tried it with other musicians; they shrugged
their shoulders. I find these kids, younger than my two sons, will
try anything.
   ``I start doodling at the piano in front of my trio. If they
say, `What's that?', I know it's time to develop the tune. I ask
them for their input also. It makes them part of the material,
which keeps it young and different.''
   Carter credits Wynton Marsalis with ``inspiring a lot of young
players to come out and take a chance. ''
   She said young performers are increasingly turning to material
``I thought I never would hear again, old Thelonious Monk, Charlie
Parker, Dizzy Gillespie tunes.'' But Carter doesn't want to keep
listening to those re-creations.
   ``I keep telling them, learn all the songs we played in those
days, know all the changes, lock it up in the brain and go for
something else. Sit and learn all the standards. They're
interesting. It's very educational to learn the blues in all kinds
of keys. Learn how to transpose.
   ``Don't listen too long to some one artist. Get in the habit of
being creative early, for the rest of your life. You could come up
with something different than anyone has ever done. It could
happen. There are 88 keys and all kinds of changes to experiment
with. A voice can do a lot of wonderful things.
   ``Only time is going to make young musicians understand what I'm
talking about. I wouldn't pay anybody any attention either in my
young age. At least they get some information in the very
beginning. Some that don't take advantage of it instantly will
catch it later.''

<HEAD>Bush Has 119 Federal Judgeships to Fill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his first opinion as a federal appeals
judge, A. Raymond Randolph ruled against the administration that
had just chosen him.
   A conservative Washington attorney nominated to the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals by President Bush earlier this year, Randolph
rejected an administration argument that a board set up to regulate
government nuclear weapons plants could meet secretly despite the
Freedom of Information Act.
   His stinging opinion issued in October was joined by two
conservative appointees of President Reagan - James L. Buckley and
Douglas H. Ginsburg.
   Between them, Bush and Reagan have appointed more than 500
federal judges over the past decade. There are 34 vacancies now,
and Bush recently signed a law creating 85 new judgeships around
the country, bringing the total number of federal trial and appeals
judges to 828.
   Those appointments have established the dominance of
conservatives on the federal bench. But as the Randolph ruling
illustrates, judges, named for life, are independent of the
administrations that send them to the bench.
   And legal scholars say the impact of ideology is overstated by
lobbying groups involved in Senate confirmation proceedings on
federal district and circuit court judges.
   ``The fact of the matter is there isn't much leeway on the part
of courts below the Supreme Court,'' said Philip B. Kurland, a
constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. ``The
troops follow the direction of the commanding officers. They go
where they are told to and there are few mutineers in their
ranks.''
   ``There has been a great deal of oversimplification and hype
around this selection process and its impact,'' said Sheldon
Goldman, a University of Massachusetts political scientist who
studies federal courts. ``The impact is there but it is much more
subtle than folks think or would like us to believe.''
   Civil rights organizations and liberal advocacy groups have
accused both Reagan and Bush of pursuing a long-range strategy to
``pack'' the federal courts with conservative ideologues.
   During the Reagan administration, liberal opposition was a
factor in the withdrawal of eight nominees to the federal bench and
the rejection by the Senate Judiciary Committee of three others.
   The confirmation battles culminated in the Democrat-controlled
Senate's rejection 1987 of Robert Bork, an outspoken conservative,
for a seat on the Supreme Court.
   So far, Bush's judicial nominees have enjoyed smoother sailing
in the Senate.
   The Bush administration has tried to ``lower the thermostat in
terms of the selection process,'' Goldman said.
   Reagan appointed a number of conservative theorists, such as law
professors Richard Posner, Frank Easterbrook and Stephen Williams.
Bush has generally appointed practicing lawyers with establishment
Republican credentials.
   Under Bush ``there certainly isn't that effort to find
professors whose judicial philosophies are carefully carved out,
there isn't that zealousness ... in trying to fit all their
candidates through this very narrow prism,'' said Melanne Verveer,
executive vice president of liberal group People for the American
Way.
   Bush's nominees ``bear an unmistakable conservative stamp but
they are not necessarily of an ideological flavor,'' said A.E.
``Dick'' Howard, a University of Virginia law professor. They are
``people who are by and large of conservative temperament but whose
background is not markedly political.''
   So far, no Bush nominee has been rejected by the Judiciary
Committee, but controversy looms next year.
   The committee took no action for seven months on Bush's
nomination of Kenneth Ryskamp, a Miami federal judge accused of
being hostile to civil rights, to a seat on the 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   The nomination died when Congress adjourned. But Ryskamp is
expected to be renominated next year when lawmakers reconvene.
   His membership in a private country club reputed to have once
excluded blacks and Jews, and his pronouncements from the district
bench, could trigger the first Senate confirmation fight over a
Bush judicial nominee.
   People for the American Way has noted in mailings to its members
that Ryskamp ruled against the plaintiffs in all but four of 41
cases involving civil and constitutional rights that came before
him. Nine of Ryskamp's civil rights rulings were reversed by the
appellate court to which he was nominated.
   Critics also point to a case in which the judge told some black
teen-agers who had been attacked by police dgs that ``it might not
be inappropriate to carry around a few scars to remind you or your
wrongdoing in the past.''
   A renewed Ryskamp nomination could end two years of relative
peace between the Democratic Senate and the Republican White House
on judicial nominees.

^Another Televised War Possible In Persian Gulf Crisis
^By JAY SHARBUTT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The blue plastic bubbles atop Saudi Arabia's
Dhahran International Hotel symbolize all that has changed in TV's
coverage of war.
   The bubbles house satellite uplink facilities, and they now
transmit reports on U.S. and other troops training for a possible
war with Iraq. Should that war begin, the uplinks would transmit
TV's taped combat coverage - faster and in greater quantities than
ever before in a large-scale conflict.
   And that coverage, for the first time, would be watched on both
sides of the battlefront. Cable News Network's coverage of U.S. and
allied troops can be seen on a same-day basis both in Baghdad and
in Washington.
   How much will be seen is anyone's guess, even though Pentagon
officials say there'll be no censorship at the transmission site in
Dhahran. Because for all the new and flashy technology, at least
one thing is expected to remain the same in a Persian Gulf war -
the friction between the military and the media.
   If fighting erupts, ABC anchorman Peter Jennings thinks U.S.
military officials ``will prevent us from seeing it as best they
can,'' although he admits that he doesn't know what really will
happen if the shooting starts:
   ``I don't know what the bottom line is ... but it's an extremely
simple environment in which to control the press.''
   Although details still are being worked out, there initially
would be print and broadcast pool coverage of any hostilities, with
a ``security review'' of outgoing material to see if it violates
ground rules of coverage.
   Even though the Pentagon says there'll be no censorship, it's
unclear what will happen if the security review causes a dispute
over a given report and what, if anything, will happen to the
reporter if the story is sent.
   ``If you agree to the ground rules, you would not expect, if you
violate them, to have access to the U.S. military resources,'' says
Robert Hall, a senior Pentagon spokesman.
   He refuses to specifically say if a violator would be barred
from accompanying U.S. troops, but ``we are confident that there is
not a problem with reporters understanding what the purpose of the
ground rules is.''
   ``We are not going to let people compromise the safety of the
troops,'' he says. ``That's the bottom line. I can't speculate on
what would happen if people did. But we are not going to allow
that.''
   Print and TV reporters in Vietnam, while also subject to ground
rules regarding tactical information, such as planned operations,
had a great deal of access toU.S. operations. American viewers saw
an uncensored war.
   But fast TV coverage wasn't common. Satellite transmission was
in its infancy and and rarely used because of cost. Field reports -
on film then, not videotape - usually aired several days after the
fact.
   But satellites got a heavy workout 23 years ago this month as
U.S. networks showed the bloody scenes of the communist Tet
offensive in Vietnam. NBC showed the first footage, shots of
fighting at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, airing it raw and unedited
on ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report.''
   Even with satellites, NBC's footage was almost a day old. It had
to be flown from Saigon to Tokyo, processed there, and then sent
via satellite to the United States. It arrived 10 minutes before
the show began at 6:30 p.m. EST.
   Despite today's swift TV coverage, network officials say that if
war starts after - or before - the Jan. 15 deadline the United
Nations has given Irag to get out of Kuwait, it's unlikely there'd
be live battlefield coverage.
   The uplink gear isn't mobile enough. It also can make a nice
target.
   ``You never say never in this business,'' says Ed Turner, CNN's
executive vice president for newsgathering. ``But it (live
coverage) is highly unlikely at this point because the gear, while
portable, ain't that portable.
   ``You still need to set up an uplink and it takes a couple of
hours to assemble. And if you're out where shells are falling. ..
.''
   Print and broadcast reporters must sign up in Dhahran, in the
same hotel where the TV satellite farm is located, at the Joint
Information Bureau - nicknamed ``The Jib.'' The bureau's director
is U.S. Army Col. William Mulvey.
   The number of print and broadcast journalists registered there
fluctuates daily, but it has almost grown to Vietnam size: 450,
when when President Bush visited U.S. troops at Thankgiving; nearly
360 later in December. Of that total, 110 were from ABC, CBS, CNN
and NBC.
   Although there's no censorship, reporters must abide by military
ground rules concerning tactical operations, unit locations and
strength.
   And Mulvey says he has warned potential pool reporters that he
won't let anyone go out with the troops ``who's not in good
physical condition. ... I don't want the safety of any of our
troops jeopardized by a journalist who can't keep up.''
   What concerns network officials far more is how much access
their crews will have to the troops in the field when and if
fighting begins, and how quickly the military will get the reports
back for satellite transmission.
   Military escorts - some of them renowned as spin doctors in
uniform - now accompany reporters on organized trips to various
U.S. units.
   The reporters have to sign up for the trips and are taken on a
first-come, first-served basis, though more than one public affairs
officer has privately admitted that TV gets precedence.
   It is clear that swarms of reporters will not be out there
wandering unescorted on the battlefield. As CNN's Turner notes, in
the initial stages, ``we'll go and only be able to show what the
military will permit the pool to show - not unlike World War II.''
   ``What the military does is that they pre-censor - they don't
take you to areas where they don't want you,'' says Ed Fouhy.
   Reporters used to accompany Fouhy when he was a Marine captain
in charge of a rifle company patrolling the Damascus-Beirut highway
during an earlier Middle East crisis - the Lebanon crisis of 1958.
   He later became a network news producer and executive, and at
one point was CBS' bureau chief in Saigon.
   Now a free-lance TV producer in Washington Fouhy thinks
restrictions will be tight in the early stages of a Persian Gulf
ar.
   ``And it'll it'll be difficult for the press corps to get a real
grip on what's happening, because it'll be so fast. A lot of it
will be air war, and a lot will be at night,'' he says.
   He also predicts that U.S. military escorts for the press ``will
not be particularly cooperative in the early going ... they'll be
uptight. But I think things will loosen up, assuming that the U.S.
is successful.''

<HEAD>Commission Report Asks Hard Look at Rural America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential panel on rural development says
in its final report that future planners should keep in mind that
there are many perceptions of rural America and its people,
including some that are not very accurate.
   The 15-member National Commission on Agriculture and Rural
Development Policy said that ``definitions of rural America
abound'' and that what appears to be rural in one part of the
nation may seem pretty citified in another.
   But the commission, which was authorized in the expiring 1985
farm law, shied away from offering a single definition of rural.
   The chairman of the commission is Charles ``Pete'' Knigge, a
dairy and grain farmer from Omro, Wis.
   Other members, representing diverse interests and regions,
include other farmers and officials of agricultural organizations,
representatives of agricultural industries and financial
institutions, public office holders and educators.
   The massive 1990 farm law includes a rural development package,
along with a provision that creates a new Rural Development
Administration within the Agriculture Department.
   Many of the existing development programs in the Farmers Home
Administration, for example, would be transferred to the new
agency.
   The commission's report, which was sent to President Bush
earlier this month, put the formation of a national rural
development policy at the top of the agenda.
   No giant federal spending programs were recommended. Federal
advice, expertise and other such help should be available, but
rural people will have to settle their own problems.
   The term rural America has come to include ``farms and forested
areas, mining and manufacturing areas, isolated small towns, and
places under the growing influence of nearby urban centers,'' the
report said.
   However, it added, if policy is to effectively address rural
needs, there must be a clear understanding of the character of
rural America.
   ``Popular beliefs about rural America are based on many
perceptions,'' the report said. ``Some, if once true, no longer
are. These misperceptions mayobscure true conditions in rural
areas and divert policies in directions that are inappropriate to
modern rural needs.''
   The commission listed five major points to help ``confront and
refute'' misperceptions relating to rural development policy. The
facts, based on the report, include:
   -Most rural Americans no longer depend mainly on farming for
their jobs and income.
   Agriculture is one of the nation's biggest industries and is the
source of food and fiber for domestic and export consumption. In
many states and rural areas, agriculture is the leading source of
basic income in the economy.
   But less than 10 percent of the rural work force is directly
employed in farming. In most rural areas, other industries,
especially manufacturing and services, have eclipsed farming as a
primary source of livelihood.
   -Rural America is more than small-town, farm-centered Midwestern
communities.
   The national perception of ``rural'' is heavily influenced by
images of small-town America, popularized in films and television,
where the simple life persists.
   The largest numbers of rural Americans live in the South, where
they are more likely to work at manufacturing jobs than in farming,
and in the Midwest, where much of the nation's food production
occurs.
   Still others call Western and New England communities home. Far
from being monopolized by farm trade centers, rural America is made
up of a diverse array of fishing villages in coastal areas, mining
towns in Appalachia and the West, mill towns in the Southeast, and
tourist centers near national parks and natural attractions.
   Each of these communities faces different challenges.
   -Not all of rural America is losing population.
   During the mid-1980s, more rural counties lost population than
grew. Over the entire decade, more people moved out of rural
America than moved into it.
   But these totals obscure the rapid growth that sometimes occurs
in many parts of rural America.
   In areas that have ``high-quality natural amenities'' such as
coastline, mountains or a warm climate, large numbers of retirees
and vacationers have made them among the fastest growing areas in
the nation.
   -Both growing and declining rural areas face difficult problems.
   Population losses cause strains for communities trying to
provide basic services. Sometimes this threatens their survival as
social and economic units.
   Growing communities, whose expanding populations bring new tax
dollars and vitality, do not suffer from declining services and
property values. But growth, especially if it's rapid, creates
other problems, including new residents with values and
expectations that differ from those of existing residents.
   Rapid growth can also put pressure on community services and
institutions to keep pace with rising demands; rising property
assessments that challenge low-income residents to meet growing tax
obligations; and the prospect that new job opportunities may go to
new residents, leaving few benefits for longtime citizens.
   -Many rural residents live in poverty.
   One in seven rural Americans, mostly in the South, have incomes
below the official government poverty level of $12,675 a year for a
family of four. The rural poor are likely to be ``working poor''
people with jobs. Many families have two or more full-time workers
whose wages are too low even to yield a poverty-level income.
   The report added: ``Concentrated in minority groups, the poor
live in areas that have been bypassed by economic growth, leaving
them few alternatives to the meager jobs they hold.
   ``Their inability to afford proper health care results in
disabilities that limit their ability to perform the manual labor
jobs on which they often depend. Their poor schools provide them
with educations inadequate to qualify them for better paying
jobs.''

   The dollar today rose against the Japanese yen for

markets.
   The dollar closed at 136.25 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's
close of 135.95 yen. It opened at 136.05 yen and ranged between
136.05 yen and 136.35 yen. The dollar now has gained 3.22 yen in
the last five trading days.
   Spot trading today totaled $2.9 billion, up from Tuesday's $2.3
billion.
   Currency dealers forecast little change for the rest of the
year, barring major developments in the Middle East or the Soviet
Union.
   North American and European financial markets were closed
Tuesday for Christmas, and markets were closed in London today.
   ``The dollar is moving at around the 136-yen mark and is likely
to stay there for a while,'' said a dealer with Daiichi Kangyo
Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A sense of political instability after Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation last week has been pushing the
dollar up. Continuing tensions in the Middle East also have
enhanced the dollar's appeal to investors seeking a safe haven
during international uncertainty.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 23,887.56 points, up 119.68 points, or 0.50 percent, from
Tuesday's finish.
   The average had fallen a total of 1,108.90 points in the
previous three trading days.
   Dealers said today's trading was extremely thin, with volume on
the first section estimated at 220 million shares, up slightly from
Tuesday's 210 million.
   Buying picked up slightly in the afternoon on local newspaper
reports on the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in Doha, Qatar, that
encouraged hopes of a peaceful resolution in the Middle East.
   Investors are waiting to see which way currencies move when
overseas markets open after the Christmas holidays, Toshiyuki
Nishiguchi of Daiwa Securities said. A stronger yen generally helps
boost the Nikkei average.
   They also are waiting for a number of events early next year,
including a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations and
the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, said Yoshiro
Inoue, a researcher at Nomura Securities.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.96 points from Tuesday's close
of 87.36. Their yield fell to 7.080 percent from 7.210 percent.

<HEAD>Mazda to Cut Executives' Salaries 5 to 10 Percent in Recall Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan said Wednesday it would
cut the salaries of its chairman and 17 other top executives by up
to 10 percent for three months in connection with a recall of
nearly 3,500 cars.
   The pay cuts for chairman Kenichi Yamamoto and the other
executives were decided one day after the Transport Ministry warned
Mazda to pay stricter attention to the safety of its cars, said a
Mazda official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The cuts, which range from 5 percent to 10 percent, will last
for the first quarter of 1991, the official said.
   The ministry has investigated charges that Mazda has been
replacing defective parts during routine maintenance without
recalling the cars or notifying the government.
   After the warning, Madza notified the ministry Tuesday that it
would recall 3,498 Luce model passenger cars produced between Aug.
8, 1986, and Jan. 31, 1987, because of switch defects in their stop
lights and cruise control mechanisms.
   Because of the defective switches, stop lights may not work even
if the driver hits the brakes and the cruise control may not turn
off quickly.
   Of the cars to be recalled, 134 were exported to Middle Eastern
countries, Mazda said. The others were sold in Japan.

   Japanese corporate executives wined, dined and
golfed their way to a record 4.98 trillion yen or about $36.5
billion in expense account spending between February 1989 and
January 1990, a tax agency report said Wednesday.
   The annual report compiled by the National Tax Administration
Agency said the figure was 9.4 percent bigger than the previous
year's, which had been the record.
   Company expense account spending is tax-deductible in Japan.
   The agency said it arrived at the figure by analyzing reports
from 59,772 of a total of 1,962,026 enterprises.
   Meanwhile, retained earnings during the period totaled 18.14
trillion yen or about $133.17 billion, up 2.72 trillion yen or 17.6
percent from the previous period, it said. They accounted for 36.6
percent of total profits, it added.
   Retained earnings are calculated by deducting taxes, dividends
and bonuses from total profits.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merger talks between Pan Am Corp. and Trans
World Airlines Inc. were on hold today after TWA Chairman Carl
Icahn accused Pan Am of showing a ``lack of good faith.''
   Pan Am and TWA negotiated through the weekend and into Monday
over whether TWA would lend Pan Am enough money to keep it
operating until the struggling carriers can merge.
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said Pan Am's representatives
canceled a Monday meeting to discuss the offer and no talks were
held Tuesday.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kreindler denied Tuesday that talks had
broken off. He said ``the next step is for Mr. Icahn to submit a
definitive offer'' to the company.
   ``We also indicated there would have to be bridge financing
until the deal could close,'' he said.
   Pan Am on Friday accepted Icahn's buyout offer of $1.50 in cash
and about $1 in preferred stock or notes for each of Pan Am's 150
million outstanding shares, as long as TWA made the loan. The deal
would value the airline at about $375 million.
   Icahn launched his offer for Pan Am as he announced plans to
sell all of TWA's London routes and some other assets to a
healthier rival, American Airlines, in a package worth $625
million.
   Icahn has sought assurances that Pan Am could repay the loan,
estimated at as much as $100 million. Icahn has proposed forwarding
Pan Am ``debtor-in-possession'' financing that would put TWA first
in line for repaymen t during a Pan Am bankruptcy reorganization.
   In a Monday letter to Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett,
Icahn wrote: ``The conflicting attitudes and signals that we have
received from you and your other representatives cause us to wonder
whether you are serious when you say that you believe that a
combination of Pan Am and TWA `would be advantageous to our
shareholders, employees and other constituencies.'''
   Icahn also wrote that he was amazed Pan Am sold its London
routes to United Airlines on Oct. 23.
   ``For Pan Am to sell assets to third parties without discussing
the same with TWA demonstrates your lack of a good faith interest
in negotiating the merger of some of our airlines,'' Icahn wrote.
   Pan Am got some financial help Monday as UAL Corp. advanced $20
million toward leaseholds on gates and other property at San
Francisco International Airport. Pan Am said the city Airports
Commission has approved the deal and final city authorization is
expected early next month.
   Weak airlines such as Pan Am and TWA have been hurt by rising
fuel costs following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August and fewer
passengers due to the recession.
   Pan Am has posted huge losses over the past decade and has
survived by selling assets piecemeal.
   Pan Am has completed the sale of two Boeing 747 jumbo jets to
UAL, and a $10 million spare parts sale is expected to be completed
soon, said Kriendler.
   The sale of the leaseholds, Boeing jets and spare parts were all
included in a $400 million deal to sell United some of Pan Am's
routes to London's Heathrow Airport.
   The route sale has been snagged as U.S. and British authorities
negotiate over whether United can take over Pan Am's authority to
use Heathrow, or be switched to the less desirable but less
congested Gatwick Airport.

   Zubaz pants are zooming off warehouse
racks in greater quantities as the zany pajama-like clothes add
pizazz, and dollars, to the fashion industry.
   But it wasn't instant success for former prison guard Bob Truax
and his weight-lifting buddy, Dan Stock, who created the wildly
patterned drawstring pants on a shoestring budget in 1988.
   ``We were laughed right out of sales meetings. We got laughed at
over the telephone,'' says Truax, who is now laughing all the way
to the bank.
   Truax and Stock began selling Zubaz (pronounced ZOO-baz) pants
in the pro shop of their Roseville weight-lifting gym. Zubaz, which
means ``in your face'' in gym lingo, was designed by a weightlifter
and sewn by inmates at women's state prison in Shakopee with fabric
bought from local stores.
   Today, they're sold in more than 75 patterns of assorted animal
hides and jungle vegetation through Warrior Distributing Co.
Similarly patterned Zubaz hats, ties, shorts, T-shirts and diaper
covers also have evolved.
   Sales of the pants and accessories are expected to at least
double in 1991 from last year, to more than $40 million, according
to the company.
   Zubaz moved from gym shops into the mainstream with the help
John Ford, a J.C. Penney Co. store manager who was wowed by the
pants after seeing two University of Minnesota football players
wearing them while shopping. He quickly placed a $270,000 order for
Penney.
   ``They've been blowing out of stores ever since,'' Stock said.
   Warrior Distributing has 5,000 retail accounts nationwide.
Besides large orders from stores like Penney, the company gets a
bevy of smaller orders from sporting goods stores, college book
stores, and small department stores.
   ``We're getting faxes (of orders) every day that are three to
four inches deep,'' Truax said. ``We've got areas of the country
where it's going nuts.'' Singer Crystal Taliefero counts herself
among the enthusiastic Zubaz wearers. She custom ordered several
pairs of pants recently.
   ``As soon as I get that I'll wear them every show. It's hot
stuff,'' she said.
   Licensed to carry the logos of National Football League and
college teams, Zubaz clothes were frequently spotted on NFL
sidelines. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jim McMahon, for
instance, gets no promotional fee for wearing an Eagles cap done in
green zebra.
   ``He's perfect for it,'' Stock said.
   Zubaz garb also has found a place on the rock scene. During a
November tour stop in the Minneapolis area, for example, Billy
Joel's band and crew members invaded the Zubaz warehouse at the
company's invitation, buying a van full of merchandise.
   The pants sell for $32 to $36; those featuring NFL logos go for
as much as $60 at stadiums.
   Stock, 31, and Truax, 32, are as laid-back as their beloved togs
- which they wear no matter where they go on business. The men
share a fondness for sports.
   The walls surrounding their adjoining offices are blanketed with
sports memorabilia and autographed pictures of sports heroes and
other celebrities. A Miami Dolphins jersey worn by Dan Marino hangs
in Truax's office and a row of NFL helmets line a shelf in Stock's.
   Warrior Distributing's eight investors, including pro wrestlers
``Hawk'' and ``Animal,'' hold equal shares in the company but Truax
and Stock handle daily operations.
   Truax and Stock have been careful to build the company around
the Zubaz label. When the existing fashions go the way of nehru
jackets, they said, the label could give rise to other fashions.
   ``We don't want to be known strictly as the guys who do the
zebra pants,'' Stock said.

<HEAD>Need Some Cash? Hock Your Home - But Carefully</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home equity loans have been developing a fast
following in these troubled economic times as more homeowners find
themselves debt-ridden and cash-strapped.
   Loans based on home values can give consumers tens of thousands
of dollars at relatively low interest rates. And unlike other
loans, the interest in many cases is tax deductible.
   But experts warn that homeowners should exercise a great deal of
caution before using their single most valuable possession as
collateral.
   ``The house is the last major remaining asset folks have and
banks are all too willing to loan against the house because the
loans are fully collaterized,'' said Robert K. Heady, publisher of
Bank Rate Monitor, a weekly newsletter based in North Palm Beach,
Fla.
   ``Consumers have to remember if they can't pay the loans back
they lose the farm.''
   Experts say the appeal of home-equity loans - with interest
rates hovering about between one and three percentage points above
banks' prime rate - should grow as rates in general continue to
decline. The prime rate for most major banks stands at 10 percent,
however, a few institutions recently lowered their rates to 9.75
percent.
   Rates remain much higher on unsecured bank loans. The average
interest rate charged on a bank credit card was 18.83 percent in
December, up from 18.60 percent at the start of the year, according
to Bank Rate Monitor. The average rate for a bank personal loan was
17.34 percent, up from 17.19 percent in January, the publication
said.
   For home equity loans banks typically lend up to 80 percent of a
home's appraised market value minus the amount owners owe on their
mortgage.
   More than $50 billion was lent out through home-equity lines of
credit in 1989, and that figure is expected to grow between 15- and
20 percent in 1990, according to the American Bankers Association.
   Despite its growing popularity, experts warn these loans can
contain many hidden costs that could run into hundreds of dollars,
such as closing costs, application fees and appraisal fees.
   Also, if the prime rate rises, consumers with variable rates
tied to the prime can suddenly be hit with a big jump in their
monthly payments.
   Particularly risky is a so-called ``balloon note'' - a loan that
calls for payments only on the interest for the first several
years. After that, the borrower must cough up payments on a big
principal.
   ``The consumer who doesn't read the details of the contract goes
for it,'' says Heady.
   For those homeowners who don't necessarily have the need for
cash right away but want the flexibility of long-term loan access,
the option of choice is taking out an extended line of credit
against their home's value.
   However, a few banks penalize consumers who don't borrow money
from the credit line, charging them an annual ``non-usage'' fee
that can be around $50, according to Heady. This is presumably to
compensate banks for the cost of servicing the loan when they don't
have the interest income.
   Other banks charge consumers who pre-pay their loans typically 2
percent of the amount in their credit line, Heady said.
   However, a prepayment penalty ``would definitely be the
exception,'' said Phillip Wilson, a senior vice president at San
Diego Trust and Savings Bank who is vice chairman of American
Bankers Association's consumer credit executive committee.

   Sales of beer, by far the most popular
alcoholic beverage in the nation, are projected to rise 2.3 percent
for a record 190 million barrels this year, a trade journal
reported Wednesday.
   ``Five of the top 10 brands are expected to post advances in
1990, collectively recording a projected gain of 1.2 percent to
130.8 million barrels,'' said the wine, spirits and beer industries
tracker Impact.
   As usual, Anheuser-Busch Inc., the world's largest brewer, leads
the domestic market. With projected shipments of 84 million
31-gallon barrels this year, Budweiser and its A-B siblings will
post 43.7 percent of market share, said the publication.
   Miller Brewing is second-best in market share with an
anticipated 22.1 percent; Coors Brewing Co., 9.9 percent; Stroh
Brewery Co., 8.0 percent, and G. Heileman Brewing Co., 6.1 percent.
Heineken continues the top-selling imported beer. None of the
figures includes sales of non-alcoholi brews.
   The final figures for the year could go even higher than
expected, said Impact, owing to the wholesaler race to stock up
before the rise in federal excise taxes on beverage alcohol goes
into effect. On Jan. 1, the excise tax on beer will double to $18 a
barrel.
   A January windfall is expected for wholesalers, who are buying
beer at pretax rise rates and planning to sell it at post-tax rise
markups, noted Impact, adding:
   ``Abnormally heavy shipments in December could result in dismal
industry sales in the first quarter of 1991, as distributors and
retailers work down pre-FET inventory.''

<HEAD>Judge Bars Stock Exchange From Seeking $50 Million Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy judge has barred the New York Stock
Exchange from seeking a record $50 million fine from Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc., saying the firm's securities law violations had
been punished adequately.
   The ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Francis Conrad means the
stock exchange can't proceed with disciplinary action against
Drexel related to the investment firm's 1989 guilty plea to six
felony counts related to illegal trading.
   The NYSE had planned to seek $25 million each from the parent
company and the securities subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
It was negotiating with Drexel when the parent filed for Chapter 11
bankrupcty protection in February.
   Under federal law, the exchange needed court approval to proceed
with the disciplinary action. The NYSE said in a statement that it
is ``reviewing the decision to determine whether an appeal is
appropriate.''
   In the ruling, dated Dec. 14, Conrad deflated the exchange's
argument that a fine was needed to send a message to Wall Street
that wrongdoing would be dealt with harshly.
   He said the NYSE's ``public policy reasons'' for seeking the
penalty ``don't appear to accomplish much more'' than Drexel's
settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Drexel in September 1989 settled civil and criminal charges by
agreeing to plead guilty to the felony counts and pay $650 million
in fines and restitution.
   Conrad agreed with Drexel in ruling that the NYSE's attempts to
extract $50 million from the firm would reult in ``the
misallocation of scarce resources'' that could be used to pay
creditors.
   Conrad also said the procedure would distract Drexel from
drawing up a reorganization plan, and that ``Drexel's professional
attention must remain focused on this critical stage.''

   Buy a soft drink, help a school. Budget's tight,
call a cola company.
   That is the thinking behind the unusual partnership between the
nation's leading beverage companies and many parents and
principals.
   In Moodus, Conn., the entire town is collecting Pepsi caps to
save the dilapidated Nathan Hale-Ray High School. In the first
three weeks, children saved 20,000 caps. At a nickel apiece the
caps won't cover $9 million in expenses, but the fund-raising drive
has raised hopes. The students have even suggested renaming the
school ``Pepsi-Cola High School.''
   It's also good business for Pepsico Inc., Pepsi-Cola's parent
company. Local stores have increased their orders; one pharmacy
ordered 6,000 bottles, said teacher Adam Friedman.
   ``We've noticed most (of the bottles turned in to recycling
centers) are Pepsi products,'' he said. ``People are committing to
Pepsi because of School Caps.''
   At Weymouth High School in Massachusetts, Pepsi and Coca Cola
are fighting over the chance to erect a new $5,000 scoreboard.
Pepsi has warned it won't donate the board if the Coke vending
machine remains in the school gym. Coke has made a counter offer to
provide a similar board.
   School officials, once hesitant to mingle educational purposes
with commercial ventures, say tight fiscal times have made these
partnerships more appealing.
   ``I generally oppose endorsing products,'' said school committee
member Francis Corbett. ``But if we're gonna make a pact with the
devil, let's get the best deal we can.''
   The National Association of Secondary School Principals supports
school-corporate partnerships if children aren't corrupted in the
process.
   ``They should not cross the line where they are using students
for their own profit motives,'' said spokesman Lew Armistead. He
said the association had objected to Channel One, a project of
Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle Communications, which provides
schools with special television news programming mixed in with
advertising.
   The beverage makers, already renowned for innovative ways to
reach consumers, have become more creative about reaching young
buyers.
   Pepsi's ``Be Excellent'' video, a montage of pop stars and
athletes preaching anti-drug and -alcohol themes, has been shown to
3 million students in 2,700 high schools this year, said Spokesman
Andrew Giangola.
   Students at Pinkston High in Dallas and Southwestern High School
in Detroit are eligible for $2,000 in scholarships if they meet
attendance, grade and drug-free goals.
   Coca Cola donated $50,000 to the Massachusetts Interscholastic
Athletic Association to keep the state's high school basketball
tournament afloat.
   The cola companies, maintaining they have always been dedicated
to community service, say interest in the programs has jumped
dramatically in the last year.
   In economically depressed New England, Coke has received double
the requests it got from schools last year, Dowd said.
   ``Schools are extremely cash-strapped and looking to corporate
America to help out wherever possible,'' said Giangola. ``This is a
great example of how businesses can help schools and schools can
help businesses.''
   Pepsi usually requires schools to install its vending machines
in return for scoreboards, computer equipment or outright cash
bonuses.
   Coca Cola, according to one vice president, does not make such
deals.
   ``We don't hold anything over their head,'' said Donald Dowd,
noting Coke sponsors high school athletic events, rewards athletes
of the week and donates money to local Boys and Girls Clubs.
   But, he added, ``We've been very fortunate, because of our
activities, to get the endorsement of these schools. That's
business.''
   For Pepsi, ``We're selling the product by virtue of the fact we
have a vending machine on site,'' said Ken Kimmel, New England
marketing director.
   Both companies say they are investing in America's future
promoting education. They're also securing loyalty among a new
generation of buyers.
   Said Pepsi's Giangola: ``In-school business is 1 percent of our
business and 100 percent of our future.''

   The stock market headed higher in slow trading
today as traders straggled back from the Christmas holiday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.84 points to
2,637.13 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 776 up, 615 down and
527 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market benefited from a downturn in interest
rates, which had been rising for the past several sessions.
   But they noted little enthusiasm for chasing after stocks as
1990 winds down.
   The showdown in the Persian Gulf appears to have dampened
expectations for any sort of New Year's rally after the pressure of
tax selling is lifted from the market.
   Many questions also linger about the economic outlook. Early
news reports described the returns from retailers' Christmas
selling season as very weak and a big disappointment.

   Soybean futures prices continued a recovery from
recent lows Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, leading grain
futures to higher levels as well.
   The rally extended a rebound in soybean and soybean meal futures
that began Monday after near-term delivery prices for those
commodities dipped to life-of-contract lows.
   ``By any standards we were a little oversold,'' said Michael
Gazall, a research analyst with the commodities brokerage Refco Inc
in Chicago.
   He said the markets drew strength from news that the Soviet
parliament had granted President Mikhail Gorbachev broader powers.
The reports helped to ease fears of a Gorbachev ouster that might
threaten future sales of U.S. grain to Moscow.
   An announcement that Soviet and U.S. trade officials will meet
Jan. 4 in Washington also supported the grain markets, Gazall said.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent to 2\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $2.66 a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2 cents higher with March at $2.35 a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 2\ cents higher with March at $1.14{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1\ cents to 5\ cents higher with January at $5.66{ a bushel.

   Nearly all American offices have copiers and
vast majorities have facsimile machines and personal computers, a
survey released Wednesday by a leading office equipment company
found.
   The Gallup survey, commissioned by the Ricoh Corp., also found
that mid-level managers are increasingly heavy users of these
machines, sometimes using them more than their support staff.
   The ``Issues in the Office'' survey found 78 percent of U.S.
offices have fax machines, 94 percent have copiers, 87 percent have
personal computers and 57 percent have laser printers.
   Twenty-nine percent of office managers use fax machines very
often, vs. 15 percent for other office workers, and 48 percent of
managers are heavy users of copiers, vs. 40 percent of other
employees, the results showed.
   ``When first introduced, office automation products were
intended largely to improve productivity among secretarial and
clerical employees,'' said Mark A. Stanton, manager of production
communications for Ricoh. ``However, we now see office equipment
climbing the corporate ladder, so to speak.''
   The study also showed larger offices are more likely to have
office equipment. For example, 90 percent of large offices have fax
machines, vs. 83 percent of medium and 60 percent of small offices.
Ninety-four percent of large offices are equipped with personal
computers, vs. 89 percent for medium and 78 percent for small.
   Ricoh said the survey was conducted this past June by The Gallup
Organization, a leading poll conductor based in Princeton, N.J.,
and was based on 500 telephone interviews with full-time office
workers from around the country. Ricoh also said findings
concerning the use of specific equipment had a sampling error of
plus or minus 11 percentage points.
   Based in West Caldwell, N.J., Ricoh is the U.S. subsidiary of
Ricoh Co. Ltd in Tokyo, a $5.3 billion diversified automated office
equipment, electronics and photographic equipment company. It is
one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of copiers and fax
machines.

   Crude oil futures posted the biggest gains in
three weeks Wednesday, rising above $27 a barrel on increasing
fears of a Middle East war.
   Contracts for home heating oil, unleaded gasoline and natural
gas also rose sharply in subdued New York Mercantile Exchange
trading after a four-day Christmas weekend.
   Light sweet crude oil for February delivery increased $1.30 to
$27.22 per 42-gallon barrel. It was the biggest single-day gain
since a $1.51 per barrel jump Dec. 4.
   Oil market strategists said increasing tension between the
United States and Iraq since the market closed last Friday after
three straight daily declines gave prices a boost.
   ``I think the market is starting to reinternalize the fact that
war seems very, very likely at this point,'' said Peter Beutel, an
oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
   On Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said the American
army would be defeated in any war because it doesn't have ``right
on its side.''
   In an interview broadcast by Mexican television, Saddam also
said he would not allow the United States to set a date for a
meeting to discuss the war. The United Nations has set a Jan. 15
deadline for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   In the Arabian Sea, U.S. and other sailors enforcing a U.N.
trade embargo fired warning shots in a fracas with crew members and
activists aboard an Iraqi ship. Traders said other U.S. and British
reports increased the prospects of war.
   ``All those things underscore what people are fearing: They're
not moving any closer to any resolution by Jan 15.,'' said Randall
Rothenberg, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The market discounted the importance of an Israeli newspaper
report - later denied by the State Department - that a date had
been set for talks.
   The oil market opened sharply higher, mimicking gains in trading
in London on Monday after Saddam threatened to attack Israel first
if Iraq were targeted.
   Volume on Wednesday was light, though, with less than half the
typical number of crude oil contracts changing hands, traders said.
Contracts for later-month delivery rose.
   Traders last week sold contracts to hedge against sudden changes
in the gulf situation over the long weekend. In addition, a belief
that diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis might bear fruit had
depressed crude oil prices in recent weeks.
   If war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, oil prices are expected
to rise sharply because of anticipated limited supplies from the
region.
   Technical factors and cold weather around the country pushed up
home heating oil futures prices. Heating oil rose 2.32 cents to
81.26 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in January after
rising 0.06 cent on Friday. Heating oil for delivery in later
months was higher.
   Unleaded gasoline rose for all delivery months, with January
contracts up 1.90 cents to 68.14 cents a gallon. Later months also
rose.
   Natural gas prices rose for a third straight trading session.
Natural gas for February delivery was up 3.7 cents at $1.999 per
1,000 cubic feet. Later months were mostly lower.

Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at

   New York precious metals markets were closed Monday and Tuesday
in observance of the Christmas holiday.
   Most financial markets in Europe, Hong Kong and Canada remained
closed on Wednesday for an extended holiday.
   Currency dealers said profit-taking following Monday's rally was
largely responsible for the dollar's decline. But they said market
sentiment toward the dollar remained strong amid continued
political and economic unrest overeas.
   ``Tensions in the Soviet Union and the Middle East continue to
provide support for the dollar,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a vice
president and trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   Johnson said trading was sluggish, with most dollar brokers
reluctant to do any major buying or selling since the overseas
markets were closed.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at
136.25 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's close. The dollar stood at

<HEAD>OJ Futures Spurt Higher On California Citrus Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices spurted higher Wednesday on the New
York Cotton Exchange, reflecting worries that heavy frost damage to
the California orange crop will hurt juice supplies.
   On other markets, precious metal futures surged along with crude
oil; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and grains and
soybeans advanced.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 1.7 cents to
3.9 cents higher with the contract for delivery in January at
$1.181 a pound.
   The rally marked the fifth straight trading day of gains for
most orange juice futures. The January contract's price soared
about 12 percent last week in anticipation of frost damage to
oranges over the Christmas weekend.
   Extremely cold temperatures on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
nights damaged most of the California navel orange crop, the
nation's main source of fresh oranges.
   Florida's orange crop, which is used mainly for juice, escaped
the freeze. But the disaster in California means a larger share of
the Florida crop probably will end up in supermarket produce
sections, analysts said.
   ``I believe we will need to bring in oranges from Florida for
the fresh market,'' said Celeste Georkakis, an orange juice analyst
with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   Conversely, some of the damaged California oranges will be
processed into frozen juice concentrate, she said. But that must be
done quickly to avoid spoilage.
   ``The whole question is how much they can process in a short
period of time because they're not geared to processing as much as
Florida,'' where 90 percent of the crop ends up as juice, Georkakis
said.
   Unusually cold weather is expected to return to Southern
California this weekend, according to the National Weather Service.
Analysts said few traders were willing to sell OJ futures ahead of
another long holiday weekend with the threat of further crop damage
in the air.
   Oil and precious metals futures rose sharply amid increasing
fears of a Middle East war.
   The rising tensions partly reflected U.S. and Iraqi officials'
inability to agree on a meeting date before the Jan. 15 deadline
set by the United Nations for withdrawal of Iraqi troops from

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange said Wednesday they had settled a lawsuit in which
S&amp;P charged the exchange with violating a 1983 licensing agreement.
   The two sides said they had signed anagreement extending the
CBOE's exclusive license to trade options on the S&amp;P 500 Index and
the S&amp;P 100 Index, two important measures of stock market activity.
   S&amp;P, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill Inc., in early November charged
the Chicago exchange with wrongly asserting an exclusive right to
use the indexes on financial products other than options contracts
traded on the exchange. The CBOE denied any breach.
   A person familiar with the out-of-court settlement said it
reaffirms S&amp;P's ability to license debt instruments and other
products using the S&amp;P 100 and 500 indexes other than options
contracts.
   There was no monetary settlement, said the official, who asked
not to be identified by name. The lawsuit had been filed in
Manhattan federal court.
   The new agreement also extends until 1998 the CBOE's exclusive
right to trade options contracts based on the two indexes.
   A CBOE spokesman said the exchange would not comment on the
terms or conditions of the agreement. McGraw-Hill spokeswoman
Elizabeth Russo said the agreement was ``mutually satisfactory.''
   The S&amp;P 100 Index and S&amp;P 500 Index measure stock performance
and are traded in units on the nation's major options exchanges.
Options give an investor the right to buy or sell a security at a
specified time for a specific price.
   S&amp;P had said its license limits the CBOE to options contracts on
the two indexes that are traded on a securities exchange and
settled through an established clearing house by payment of cash or
the underlying security.
   S&amp;P said the CBOE's rights do not apply to other financial
instruments that offer a return based in whole or part on the two
indexes. Those include notes, certificates of deposit and other
debt instruments, products that trade over the counter and
financial instruments issued by institutions other than an
exchange.
   The dispute began when S&amp;P withdrew a note offering for Denmark
earlier this year that paid interest based on the S&amp;P 500.
Underwriters for the issue were said to have withdrawn from the
deal because of challenges by CBOE officials to use of the index.
   S&amp;P, a financial information and credit rating agency, for
several years has licensed the rights to use its indexes in
connection with financial products sold off of exchanges.

<HEAD>Pennzoil Receives IRS Extension to Buy More Chevron Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co. said Wednesday it had upped a stake
in Chevron Corp. after the Internal Revenue Service granted a
five-month extension for Pennzoil to invest proceeds from its 1988
court settlement with Texaco Inc.
   Pennzoil spent $2.1 billion of a net $2.6 billion settlement in
1989 to purchase 31.5 million common shares of Chevron, giving it 9
percent ownership in the company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington, Pennzoil said that as of Wednesday it owned 32.8
million shares - approximately 9.4 percent of the 350.8 million
shares outstanding.
   Pennzoil said 1.27 million of those 32.8 million shares were
purchased during the past 60 days on the New York Stock Exchangen
at an average price of $69.75 per share.
   In July, Pennzoil notified the Federal Trade Commission of its
intent to increase its ownership level to slightly under 10 percent
by purchasing additional Chevron shares.
   Pennzoil said it needed the extension from the IRS because of
delays in obtaining clearance from the FTC, which monitors business
activity that is considered potentially anticompetitive.
   Under the IRS delay, Pennzoil said, the company now has until
May 31, 1991 to invest proceeds from its historic 1988 Texaco
litigation settlement.
   Pennzoil sued Texaco in 1985, claiming Texaco violated a
contract when it purchased Getty Oil Co. at the same time Pennzoil
was attempting to acquire part of Getty.
   A jury awarded Pennzoil more than $10 billion, the largest award
in litigation history, but Texaco sought bankruptcy court
protection afterward and the two oil companies settled on $3
billion, before expenses, as part of Texaco's re-emergence from the
bankruptcy process. The net settlement to Pennzoil was about $2.6
billion.
   Under IRS rules, Pennzoil can defer taxes on the Texaco
settlement if it is reinvested in similar or related property.

<HEAD>Eastern Gets U.S. Government Contract Worth Up To $100 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has been given a U.S. government
contract worth up to an estimated $100 million to carry federal
employees traveling on business in 1991.
   Financially troubled Eastern was ``pleased that the government
recognizes our fine record in providing safe, reliable
transportation at a good value,'' its bankruptcy court-appointed
trustee Martin R. Shugrue said.
   The award comes as the U.S. Justice Department pursues a
60-count criminal indictment against Eastern and nine of its top
managers, charging that safety records and other maintenance
documents were falsified to keep its planes flying on time.
   An affidavit quoted confidential informants as telling federal
investigators that as recently as last month Eastern falsified
safety and maintenance records.
   Eastern officials have denied the allegations.
   Eastern, which has lost millions of dollars and become a smaller
carrier, has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since
an unresolved strike began in March 1989.
   The contract was for more than 345 domestic and international
routes. That's a large increase over the 220 routes the airline
received in 1990, which were worth an estimated $52 million.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo's appointment
Thursday of American-educated Lee Bong-suh as Trade and Industry
Minister is seen as an effort to mend trade frictions between Seoul
and Washington.
   The appointment was the only economic post changed in a cabinet
shakeup that included a the naming of a new prime minister and
foreign minister.
   The new Trade Minister is considered knowledgeable in U.S.
affairs, having studied at American universities and worked in
Washington. Observers hope he will be able to heal animosities
between the two longtime allies on trade matters.
   The United States is South Korea's largest trading partner.
Washington has pressured Seoul to open its markets wider to foreign
goods and farm products.
   The Seoul government claims foreign imports will hurt the
competitiveness of Korean goods and threaten the livelihood of
Korean workers. Radical students and farmers have staged violent
protests demanding a halt to U.S. trade pressure.
   Lee, 54, is a 1959 graduated of the University of Pennsylvania
and received a doctorate in economics from Harvard in 1965. He
worked in Washington during the 1960s for the U.S. Federal Reserve
and the World Bank.
   He returned to South Korea in the early 1970s and entered a long
term of government service.
