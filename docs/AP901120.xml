<HEAD>Wife of Mail Bomb Suspect Pleads Guilty to Witness Tampering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The estranged wife of a man accused in two fatal
mail bombings has pleaded guilty in a related witness-tampering
case, an Atlanta newspaper reported in its Wednesday editions.
   Susan Moody, 28, is cooperating with government prosecutors in
their case against Walter Moody Jr., the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution said.
   Moody was charged earlier this month in the mail bombings of
federal appeals judge Robert Vance in Alabama and civil rights
activist Robert Robinson in Savannah, Ga., last December.
   Mrs. Moody entered the guilty plea Nov. 10 before U.S. District
Judge Anthony Alaimo, the paper quoted people close to the
investigation as saying. Alaimo sealed records of the proceeding,
and his action prohibits participants from even acknowledging
whether a hearing took place.
   Walter and Susan Moody were indicted in July on 13 counts of
obstruction of justice, bribery and witness tampering.
   They are accused of threatening two women who had been paid to
provide a fake alibi for Moody during his efforts to overturn a
1972 bomb-possession conviction. The women were considering
changing their story.
   Both Moody and his wife originally entered innocent pleas in
that case, but Mrs. Moody changed her plea to guilty, the
Journal-Constitution reported.
   Moody is being held without bond in the Atlanta Federal
Penitentiary. Mrs. Moody, who has filed for divorce, is living with
her parents in DeKalb County.
   As Moody's wife when the alleged crimes occurred, it is Mrs.
Moody's choice whether to invoke spousal immunity from testifying,
lawyers said.
   In a related development, a Florida man who had been holding
three footlockers for Moody that contained diagrams for a remote
control bomb was denied bail Monday.
   The footlockers found at the home of Ted Banks of Titusville,
whom agents described as a close friend of Moody's, also contained
five weapons, a book with bomb formulas, three pieces of pipe and
several metal rods.
   Banks, 63, was arrested Friday on charges of receiving weapons
while being a convicted felon.
   U.S. Magistrate Donald Dietrich denied the bond request, saying
there was enough evidence that Banks was involved with the ``crimes
of violence currently under investigation.''

   The New York City Ballet opened its winter
season with a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of
Tchaikovsky, performing his music as choreographed by the late
George Balanchine.
   The show Tuesday night at the New York State Theater was
followed by a benefit party, with tables for 10 going for up to
$10,000.
   The evening began with ``Serenade,'' which Balanchine
choreographed in 1935. His signature was evident right from the
start, as small groups of ballerinas with intertwined arms moved in
intricate patterns.
   Balanchine didn't give the men, in this case Lindsay Fischer and
Leonid Kozlov, much to do in ``Serenade.'' Maria Calegari, Melinda
Roy and Heather Watts were superb in the leading parts.
   Merrill Ashley was an audience favorite dancing the 1960
creation, ``Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux,'' with Jock Soto. This isn't a
romantic duet. It's a dance for dance's sake. Soto, an exciting
young dancer, displayed impressive classical technique.
   The performance ended with the 1967 ``Diamonds,'' which
Balanchine originally made the last part of an evening that
included ``Rubies'' and ``Emeralds.''
   Kyra Nichols and Adam Luders danced the parts created for
Suzanne Farrell and Jacques d'Amboise, to music from Tchaikovsky's
``Third Symphony.''
   Ballerinas wore real diamonds, on loan for the evening.
   Hugo Fiorato conducted.

   An Associated Press list of Army National
Guard and Army Reserve units called to active duty on Monday
erroneously reported that three National Guard combat brigades from
Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana had been called to active duty.
   Pentagon spokesman Major Doug Hart said Monday the combat units
were called up as part of a broad activation of reserves. On
Tuesday, he said he had misunderstood the makeup of units called up
and the three brigades were not among them.
   The brigades are the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of
Georgia, the 155th Armored Brigade of Mississippi and the 256th
Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana. The Pentagon had said
previously they would be activated, but no specific date has been
announced.

<HEAD>Store Firebombed in Incident Linked to Newspaper Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small store was firebombed and two employees
were hurt Tuesday hours after a man allegedly demanded that the
owners stop selling the Daily News, police said.
   The bodega in the Bronx section was heavily damaged in the
early-morning attack, police said. Two employees who suffered
slight injuries refused medical attention, police said.
   Officer Janice Swinney said police believe the incident was
linked the nearly month-long strike at the newspaper because a man
came into the store Monday evening and told employees not to sell
the News.
   Violence has punctuated the strike since it began on Oct. 25.
   Many vendors, saying they have been intimidated, are refusing to
sell the News, which before the strike was the nation's
third-largest metropolitan daily newspaper.
   The Daily News, using management, replacement workers and
returning Newspaper Guild members, has published every day since
the strike began.
   But circulation has lagged. The News said last week that it was
printing 600,000 papers a day and selling about 400,000, down from
1.09 million before the strike. It said 2,000 of its usual 12,000
outlets were selling the paper.
   The News has hired hawkers, including homeless and other
unemployed people, in an attempt to fill the void.

   The toll from Typhoon Mike's two-day
rampage through the central Philippines has risen to 335 dead and
205 missing, the Office of Civil Defense said today.
   The Nov. 13-14 typhoon injured nearly 500 people and caused
about $275 million in damage to property and crops, the office
said.
   The storm forced 3.2 million Filipinos to seek temporary shelter
in schoolhouses and evacuation centers. It destroyed 116,512 houses
and damaged 294,131 others, the civil defense office said.
   Most of the damage was in the Visayas islands of central
Philippines.

<HEAD>British Rail To Be Prosecuted Over Disaster That Killed 35</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans to prosecute British Rail on
criminal charges for a train wreck in south London that killed 35
people two years ago, officials said.
   Allan Green, director of public prosecutions, decided in May
that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges
against the state-owned rail line or any of its employees.
   But Tuesday, the Department of Transport said the board that
runs the network was being served summonses under the Health and
Safety Act that allege it criminally failed to take all practical
steps to ensure safety.
   On Dec. 12, 1988, an express train on its way to central London
from southern England crashed into the back of a stationary train
at Clapham in south London. The driver of the stationary train had
stopped to report a faulty signal. In addition to those killed,
about 500 people were injured.
   One summons alleged that by failing to provide effective
signaling, British Rail did not ensure the safety of its employees.
A second summons alleged British Rail failed to ensure passengers
were not exposed to safety risks.
   The Battersea Magistrates Court in southwest London will meet
Jan. 7 to decide if there is enough evidence to warrant trial.
   ``It is far too early to say how the board will plead,'' a rail
board spokesman said. ``We will have to examine the prosecution
case in detail and speak to witnesses as well before commenting
further.''
   Lawyer Sir Anthony Hidden found during a public inquiry last
year that while rewiring signals in the area, a technician had
failed to cut back a small piece of old wire.
   This interfered with new wiring, causing the signal to flick
from green to red and back again.
   In September, an inquest jury ruled the 35 were unlawfully
killed.
   British Rail has admitted civil responsibility and paid out
nearly $2 million in compensation in 300 cases so far.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Come on, says Mother Wonderful. Have some
cheesecake. It won't kill you.
   ``No one ever got cardiovascular disease from a sliver of
cheesecake now and then,'' says Mother Wonderful, alias Myra
Chanin. ``Don't eat cheesecake three times a day, but when you do
have it, enjoy it to the max.''
   Chanin's book, ``Mother Wonderful's Cheesecakes and Other
Goodies,'' first came out in 1982 and went out of print. The second
edition now is in its second printing.
   Chanin, whose cheesecakes come in flavors like ginger pear,
mocha blanca and honey fig, isn't surprised. She sees good food as
essential for marital bliss.
   ``Soft lights, sweet music and diaphanous gowns may create an
evening's diversion, but comes the dawn and even Casanova must
eat,'' she says in the book's introduction.
   Professional bakers agree that cheesecakes haven't lost their
attraction.
   ``We're selling more than ever,'' said Janet Rosing, owner of
Cheesecakes by J.R. in Chicago.
   Ms. Rosing estimates she sells more than five tons of cheesecake
a week. ``It's fun to visualize, isn't it?'' she said.
   Nancy Bier, owner of Miss Grimble Associates in New York, says
people think of cheesecake as something special.
   ``When people want dessert and want to splurge, they say, `Let's
have a piece of cheesecake.' Everyone likes the flavor and the fact
that it's so rich.''
   Miss Grimble's has been in business for about 20 years and turns
out about 50 different cakes and pies, but Mrs. Bier said
cheesecake still is the No.1 item.
   ``The classic vanilla with a sour cream topping is the best
seller,'' she said.
   Several qualities come together to make a good cheesecake, Ms.
Rosing said.
   ``It's a combination of creamy texture, which is very
satisfying, and the flavors of the cream and the sweetness,'' she
said. ``People feel they're really getting value in cheesecake.
There's really something substantial there. It's not some light,
fluffy thing.''
   Even a doctor from the American Heart Association went along -
somewhat - with Mother Wonderful's idea that a sliver of cheesecake
once in a while isn't all that bad.
   ``I would certainly agree with a sliver now and then, but what
does one call a sliver?'' said Dr. Alan Chait, chairman of the
AHA's Nutrition Committee. ``And if you bake a whole cheesecake,
who's going to eat just a sliver?''
   Chait, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington,
said the AHA doesn't preach the idea of good or bad food.
   ``The important thing is a person's total diet - a diet that is
low in saturated fat and cholesterol - rather than the individual
food,'' he said.
   Both the AHA's cookbook and Mother Wonderful offer low-fat
cheesecake suggestions.
   Chanin also offers encouragement to the nervous cook.
   ``Cheesecake is the easiest dessert to make! How did it get such
an awesome reputation? Bakers lie. When you find out how easy it is
to make cheesecake, you'll stop paying $25 for theirs and start
baking your own.''
   She thinks the problem is the old-fashioned ways of baking.
   ``People are still using recipes that were created in 1850.
Ovens then had no thermostats, so they'd tell you to bake the cake
in the oven for half an hour and leave them in the oven with the
door ajar. You couldn't leave the house!
   ``Then there are those recipes that tell you to put your
cheesecake pan in a pan filled with boiling water! I think that one
was invented by Johnson &amp; Johnson, to sell more Band-Aids. There's
no better way in the world to scald yourself.''
   There's none of that in this cookbook. What Chanin does offer is
advice such as how to get that creamy, custardlike texture.
   ``Since I never want to unwrap another package of cream cheese,
I pass on all my secrets to you,'' she confides before introducing
her ``Ten Commandments for Making Perfectly Baked Cheesecakes Every
Time.''
   Actually, there are 17 commandments, which Chanin admits tends
to prove her husband's contention that she is ``bossier than God.''
Among them:
   - Thou Shalt Not Chintz on Ingredients.
   - Thou Shalt Never Defile Thy Crusts with Graham Cracker Crumbs.
   - Thou Shalt Never Even Think About Using Those Gunky Cornstarch
Toppings.
   - Thou Shalt Measure Out Ingredients before Beginning to Bake.
   - Thou Shalt Always Add Eggs to Thy Batter with Thy Mixer on the
Lowest Speed.
   She really means it about using the best ingredients.
   ``The cost differential between a sublime cheesecake and a
third-rate one is less than $3. If money is a problem, make an
8-inch version and serve petite wedges, but always make sure anyone
who tastes it will rave about your skill and beg for more.''

<HEAD>Australian Weather Too Hot for Crocodile Mating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queensland's dry hot weather is doing
nothing, absolutely nothing for the love life of the state's
crocodiles.
   Crocodile farmer John Lever says the crocs mate once a year and
depend on monsoon rains - due around now.
   ``But with the dry, dry weather we've been having, there's no
stimulus at all ... The crocs are all sort of lying about in
anticipatory glory, they've gone off their food and they're
listless, some of the males are a bit tetchy and we're all getting
a bit anxious.''
   He said the farm's ``passion'' indicator, a frolicksome female
nicknamed ``the old tart,'' was stirred only faintly by a recent
thunderstorm.
   ``She's always the first one to be switched on ... but even she
has hardly batted an eyelid,'' Lever said.
   He said the croc exhibited some signs of arousal after the
thunder and lightning, stretching her neck and blowing bubbles in
the water, but she failed to draw any sign of interest from the
males.
   A heavy rain was needed, he said.
   Otherwise, males could miss out on the female's peak once-a-year
fertility period and the eggs would be sterile.
   Like all farmers, he said, ``we're really dependent on the
weather.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gloom has replaced the euphoria
that enveloped Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution a year ago.
Economic worries abound and Slovak nationalism threatens to split
the country.
   Ordinary people are fearful without the economic security the
old communist system provided. Economists forecast that
unemployment and inflation will rise rapidly as the nation converts
to capitalism.
   President Vaclav Havel, the former dissident playwright who
personified the ``velvet revolution,'' has acknowledged the
national malaise.
   ``A question is looming over this state: whether it is dying due
to its own faults,'' he said in a television speech Oct. 28, the
72nd anniversary of Czechoslovakia's birth. ``We do not have too
many reasons to be satisfied.''
   Such national uncertainty has seldom been matched since the
Czechs and Slovaks joined in 1918, after centuries of domination by
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to create Czechoslovakia.
   The two nations were separated by the Nazis during World War II,
and afterward, Czechoslovakia spent 40 years as part of the Soviet
bloc.
   Now, with the disintegration of the communist empire, Slovak
separatism is resurgent and the threat of another separation has
become real.
   Slovaks make up about one-third of the 15.5 million people and
occupy the more rural eastern part of Czechoslovakia. Under the
centralized communist government, nearly all Slovak affairs were
decided in Prague, the federal capital.
   Discord between Czechs and Slovaks seemed non-existent a year
ago; they filled the streets together to bring down the old regime.
   Czechoslovaia's revolution began Nov. 17. 1989, when police
brutally beat thousands of students demonstrating for more rapid
democratic change of the kind that was transforming Poland, Hungary
and East Germany.
   The police brutality inspired street protests that toppled the
Communist Party Politburo seven days later. Before the end of the
year, Havel and fellow dissidents were in power.
   Havel visited several countries in the ensuing months. Back
home, the mood remained euphoric, with rising crime and increasing
nationalism seen as relatively minor problems accompanying the
revolution.
   Because about 5 million Czechoslovaks were at least indirectly
beholden to the communists, the interim government's campaign
against the party was not entirely successful.
   In elections June 8, Havel's Civic Forum and Public Against
Violence, its Slovak sister organization, won 57 percent of the
vote. The turnout was 97 percent.
   The first economic shocks came after the elections. Food prices
were raised, gasoline prices went up 50 percent and train fares
doubled. Disillusionment spread and many people had a sense of
betrayal.
   ``We disregard our everyday worries for the sake of discussing
privatization ... leaving the spiritual values aside,'' Daniela
Kolarova, an actress and member of Parliament, said earlier this
year. ``We keep hearing the argument that, once the economy starts
functioning, there will be time for the soul.''
   Slovak nationalists have held mass demonstrations for months. In
mid-November, thousands of Slovaks marched in Bratislava, capital
of Slovakia, demanding secession. They were angered by their
regional government's efforts to reach agreement on power sharing
with the Czech and fed administrations.
   Some members of the Slovak parliament also have demanded a
separate nation.
   The resurgent Slovak separatism cast a cloud over the 72nd
anniversary ceremonies and led Havel to appeal for cooperation.
   ``I believe our reason, our sense of togetherness, our
responsibility, culture as well as the instinct for
self-preservation will prevail,'' he said in the televised address.
   Some people old enough to remember the two separate nations seem
to be preparing for the memory to become reality again.
   ``It just may be that the end of the communist excursion into
history could bring the end of the Czechoslovak experiment, too,''
a 78-year old Czech told a reporter who asked his opinion.

   Every once in a while, Umberto Bilisco used to
disappear for a few hours into the attic. His parents thought he
was looking for a book. But Bilisco was on a secret mission.
   Working alone, the young state employee would carefully set up
sophisticated radio equipment. As his parents placidly watched TV
downstairs in their home in the northern city of Trieste, Bilisco
would practice calling the contacts he would need during a Soviet
bloc invasion.
   Bilisco was one of 622 Italians who belonged to an
anti-Communist network recently exposed in Europe. Set up by secret
services in the 1950s, in some cases with CIA help, it was
coordinated through NATO.
   Throughout Western Europe, men and women like Bilisco secretly
trained for years in how to blow up bridges, conduct secret radio
conversations and organize a resistance movement in the event of
invasion.
   The organization, in many cases, is only being dismantled now.
   ``I entered this organization with enthusiasm,'' said Bilisco,
now 64. ``Here in Trieste, we had terrible moments after the war.''
   Bilisco and a few dozen other members of the Italian
organization have been exposed by the press since Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti last month disclosed the existence of the group,
known as ``Operation Gladio.''
   Those who agreed to interviews have described years of secrecy
in which they were spirited off to military bases for training or
contacted by strangers using code names.
   Several say they met U.S. military officials during their
training in the 1960s. Their reports contradict statements by some
U.S. officials that Washington helped organize the units but had
nothing to do with them after the 1950s.
   Like Bilisco, most say they joined Gladio out of patriotism and
fear of an invasion during the Cold War.
   ``Today, with things the way they are and the way Gorbachev has
changed Europe, there's no more need for a service of this kind,''
said Mattia Passudetti, 70, a former ``gladiator'' from Udine.
   ``But if conditions were the same as back then, there would
be.''
   Operation Gladio has caused an uproar in Italy because of
speculation by politicians and newspapers that it might be linked
to a series of unsolved terrorist attacks in the 1960s and 1970s
attributed to the right wing.
   But the members of Gladio - named for the swords carried by
Roman gladiators - deny such assertions.
   ``All the things we learned were things that would help in a
guerrilla movement, in the case of war,'' Bilisco said in a
telephone interview. ``They never said anything about politics.''
   The Italian ``gladiators'' received training at a base on the
island of Sardinia and at a military installation near Rome,
according to the accounts. Periodically, exercises were held in
northern Italy.
   It was during such an exercise that Gianmario Pierantoni, 60,
worked with American soldiers, he said.
   ``I only know that it was a group coming from Vietnam, the
Airborne Cavalry,'' Pierantoni said in a telephone interview from
Verona.
   ``We did a training exercise ... a Viet-Cong type thing among
the hills,'' he said. Pierantoni practiced escorting people out
through enemy lines during the 1965 exercise, which involved four
to five Italians and a squad of Americans, he said.
   Passudetti said two American military men as well as some
French- and German-speaking officers observed his training exercise
in September 1962.
   Unlike the others, Bilisco said he worked only with Italians.
   The state land-surveyor entered Gladio in 1960 at the invitation
of an old school friend, he said.
   ``I joined on condition it was an organization recognized by the
state,'' he said. ``He assured me it was.''
   Bilisco took a four-month night course at a local school to
learn how to communicate by radio. Then, during a two-year period,
a mysterious instructor who seemed to be a police officer came to
Trieste frequently to train him further.
   The lifelong bachelor went to a military base near Rome three
times for instruction with others, whom he knew only by their first
names. The last session was in 1980.
   The group also held a practice exercise in the mountains near
Bergamo in northern Italy, he said.
   ``My job was to receive messages and transmit the organizational
plans,'' he said. ``We simulated a guerrilla situation. When a
plane passed over, we had to hide.''
   Bilisco has no regrets about his years in the secret
organization.
   ``If by chance, during the training, I learned that there was
something fishy, I would have resigned immediately,'' he said. ``I
saw it was legal - secret, but of the state.''

<HEAD>Fresh Turkey For 230,000 Americans in Persian Gulf</HEAD>

   It looks like virtually all
230,000 Americans deployed in the Persian Gulf will be eating fresh
turkey with all the trimmings on Thanksgiving Day.
   But just in case, the U.S. military has 600,000 prepackaged
turkey dinners stashed in a warehouse.
   Since mid-August, Chief Warrant Officer Wes Wolf has been
preoccupied with trying to provide American servicemen a holiday
meal that will remind them of Mom's home cooking.
   For the 42-year-old major domo of military cuisine, that means
fresh food rather than prepackaged, TV-style tray rations known as
T-rats in militaryspeak.
   ``I've only got one unit that's going to eat T-rats, and I think
I'm going to be able to get them fresh rations,'' he said. ``About
230,000 soldiers are going to be eating fresh rations.''
   For five days now, Wolf has been overseeing the distribution of
Thanksgiving dinner courses from three huge warehouses staffed by
the 123rd Supply and Service Company from Alabama National Guard.
   Supply officers from 139 different military units, from 15
people to 35,000 in size, have been arriving to pick up ingredients
ranging from shrimp cocktail to after-dinner nuts and ``Happy
Thanksgiving'' banners.
   Tuesday was the day for salad fixings, vegetables, half a dozen
varieties of fruit, 45,000 pies in five flavors, whipped cream and
bread.
   Thanksgiving may be American but the ingredients for dinner are
as international as the multinational force deployed here following
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The 60,000 pounds of rolled, boneless turkey from the United
States and 2,000 whole turkeys from Saudi Arabia, each weighing 15
to 20 pounds, have already been picked up by units scattered around
the country and are being prepared for the roasting pans.
   Because Saudi Arabia is a Moslem country, which forbids the
eating of pork, the U.S. military has cut pork products from its
menus. But Wolf said he decided to make an exception for
Thanksgiving and include ham shipped from the United States.
   There will be plenty of other American contributions: shrimps,
mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, fruit cake and pumpkin,
pecan and mince meat pies.
   But the roast beef is from Saudi Arabia, the cherry and apple
pies from Germany, the grapes from Lebanon, the oranges from
Brazil, and the tomatoes and vegetables from Lebanon, Turkey and
Syria.
   Ehad Kamal, general manager of Sanad Trading Cold Storage where
the produce is kept, said he ordered 25,000 cartons of bananas from
the Philippines and Honduras, each with 90 bananas, which means
every man and woman in the military here will be getting five
bananas.
   ``Too many bananas,'' he said with a laugh.
   The military also printed 230,000 souvenir menus, featuring a
turkey on the cover and President Bush's Thanksgiving message
inside.
   Bush will be dining on the same food as the troops when he flies
in for Thanksgiving dinner, Wolf said.
   There is no front-line combat version of Thanksgiving dinner,
known as an MRE or Meal-Ready-To-Eat that comes in a bag and is
usually eaten cold. But Wolf ordered holiday T-rats so units
without kitchens could still have a hot meal.
   ``We've got units coming in every night and I just wanted to
make sure that on Thanksgiving, if a soldier showed up in Saudi
Arabia, I'd be able to give him some turkey, some cranberry sauce,
some mashed potatoes,'' he said.
   Two people helped Wolf plan dinner and 160 others worked on it.
   ``I've fed up to 30,000 soldiers at one time, but never this
many. So, it's been really tough,'' he said. ``But we're in good
shape with everything.''
   With all troops expected to eat fresh food, known in
militaryspeak as A-rations, Wolf will have plenty of holiday T-rats
for Christmas and holidays next year, if need be.
   After Thanksgiving dinner with troops in the desert, Wolf said,
he plans to get a good night's sleep and then get back to work on
Christmas dinner.
   The rangy warrant officer from Monterey, Calif., nicknamed
``Santa Claus'' by Maj. Gen. William ``Gus'' Pagonis, the U.S.
Army's logistics chief, said he started on Christmas two weeks
after he began Thanksgiving preparations.
   ``I've just had to double my figures for Christmas because we're
bringing some more troops in,'' he said.

   After being grounded half a year,
Columbia appeared headed for an early December liftoff with an
observatory despite scientists' pleas that NASA wait another week
for better viewing.
   The space agency turned its attention to Columbia after Atlantis
ended a secret military mission Tuesday with the first shuttle
landing at Kennedy Space Center in five years.
   Columbia is expected to blast off around Dec. 2 with the $150
million Astro observatory on a mission that has been on hold since
May because of hydrogen leaks. Scientists, however, are pushing for
a launch on Dec. 10 or so.
   ``The science will be much better if it's a few days later,''
said mission scientist Ted Gull.
   Certain objects of extreme interest, like the brightest visible
quasar, won't be as close to the sun in mid-December and will thus
be more distinguishable.
   Also, there will be a full moon Dec. 2, and an astronomy mission
should take place under a dark sky, Gull said.
   Because of the delays in getting Columbia off the ground,
``We've always jokingly said it's going to be a full moon'' when
the shuttle finally goes up, Gull said.
   NASA officials are expected to set a launch date after a review
on Tuesday. It will be the fifth countdown since May for the
mission, originally scheduled for 1986 but delayed until this year
by the Challenger accident.
   Columbia's seven astronauts, four of them astronomers, are eager
to get going. They will work around the clock in shifts during the
10-day flight, the first shuttle mission in five years devoted
entirely to scientific research.
   ``We're going to be the best trained crew you've flown,''
mission commander Vance Brand jokingly told shuttle directors
recently.
   Bascom Murrah, in charge of Columbia's prelaunch operations,
said that when the shuttle finally lifts off, ``I don't know if I'm
going to cry or dance or feel relieved.''
   Columbia's leaks were much more extensive than those plaguing
Atlantis. Workers replaced Columbia's hydrogen lines and installed
new seals. Both shuttles were found to be free of dangerous leaks
during a fueling test last month.
   Scientists have been working seven days a week since Columbia's
latest launch delay in mid-September to revise the observing
schedule.
   Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope
will probe about 240 high-energy objects, including galaxies and a
supernova.
   One observation is planned of Comet Levy, which is on its way
out of the solar system and less visible than it was in September.
   Halley's Comet was among Astro's targets when the mission was
scheduled for 1986. Astronomers planned to study Comet Austin if
Columbia had gone up in May.
   ``Every time we try to plan a mission with a comet, that mission
has been postponed. We're beginning to wonder if it's our
nemesis,'' Gull said.
   He joked, ``There's not a bright one coming (in December), so we
can go.''

   Zachariah Toungate is a typical
8-year-old, hunting for rocks and playing with Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, and his grades are excellent.
   But his school says Zach is a disciplinary problem because he
refuses to cut his 7-inch ponytail, and confines him to a
10-by-13-foot isolation room all day.
   His parents are backing him up.
   For more than six weeks, Zach has been parting with his
third-grade classmates when they get off the bus at Mina Elementary
School and stepping into what school officials call an
``alternative education setting.''
   The room has two windows facing into a bigger classroom, but
they are covered.
   To Zach, it is a prison that has given him nightmares about
being trapped in a room that shrinks until it crushes him.
   ``They put me in jail, so why shouldn't we put them in jail,''
he says of school officials.
   Zach is taught alone. His mother, grandmother and aunt take
turns going to school and eating with him because he is not allowed
in the lunchroom.
   His parents, September and Stanley Toungate, were told the
ponytail did not comply with the school's dress code.
   ``I like the way my hair is. I think the rule stinks because
girls can have long hair and boys can't,'' Zach said Monday.
   Mrs. Toungate said she offered to pin the ponytail up, or even
have Zach wear a short-haired wig. Aside from the ponytail, Zach
has a crew cut.
   ``I've tried to compromise with them in every way,'' she said.
``All I want for my children is to go to a school in a place that
doesn't discriminate.''
   The Toungates appealed to the school board, and it refused to
budge. They took their case to state district court, claiming
sexual discrimination.
   The judge denied a temporary injunction that would have returned
Zach to the classroom and back into the choir and art classes he
misses. The Toungates' attorney, Charles Beall, said they will
appeal to the 3rd Court of Appeals.
   ``I told Zach that if this is ever too much of a problem, we
will drop it,'' Beall said. ``He says, `No, I don't want to cut
it.'''
   Zach is taught by substitute teachers. He makes excellent
grades, but would rather be with his classmates. Occasionally
another student is sent to the room for detention, but they
eventually leave. Zach remains.
   School superintendent Paul Fleming said Zach's case has gained
more attention then it deserves.
   ``It's a matter that has a rather simple solution. The mother
has a right to try and get a policy changed. The logical solution
would be to get the youngster in compliance with the dress code and
then pursue her battle,'' Fleming said.
   ``One of the things that students have to learn is that there
are rules and regulations in life that you may not necessarily
agree with but you have to live with,'' he said.
   Mrs. Toungate, who grew up in a military family, says she
understands some rules are tough to abide by, but adds that she has
learned ``you are an American first, and the rest of it doesn't
matter.''
   Ironically, Mrs. Toungate, who is studying to be nurse, and her
auto mechanic husband moved 30 miles from Austin to this town of
5,700 people so that Zach and his 5-year-old sister, Linzi, could
benefit from the country lifestyle.
   Now, they have become the focus of attention.
   Mrs. Toungate said some parents side with her, saying the
school's dress code is ridiculous. But she said others accuse her
of trying to usurp school rules.
   ``I want rules. Children need rules. My children have rules at
my home. I want rules that apply to all students,'' Ms. Toungate
said.

<HEAD>After Just a Week, Couple Wins Race to Conceive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fun was over practically before it
started when a couple who had entered a three-way contest to see
who could be the first to conceive was declared the winner after
just one week.
   James and Lisa Machamer of Des Moines will get a $1,000 savings
bond, a crib and six months of diaper service as winners of the
Breeders Cup promotion sponsored by radio station KRNQ. Another
prize will arrive in nine months.
   Positive results from a home pregnancy test taken on Friday were
confirmed by a doctor Monday, said KRNQ sales manager Scott
Schubert.
   ``I don't think the contest made any difference - we didn't do
anything different,'' said Mrs. Machamer, 22. ``That's the first
question everybody wants to know.''
   The Machamers and two other couples were among about 20 who
responded to the station's invitation to participate in the
Breeder's Cup, which was open to married couples without children.
The three couples were chosen by lot.
   The contestants agreed to talk about their experiences on the
radio each Friday. Schubert said the promotion was one of the
hottest ever at the station.
   Schubert said the station didn't receive any complaints about
making public the usually private ``trying'' part of conceiving.
   ``If it's done with taste, you can do it,'' he said.
   Mrs. Machamer said the publicity far exceeded her expectations,
``and I don't know if we would have done it if we had known ahead
of time.''
   She said she didn't do much talking on the radio.
   ``It was a little embarrassing,'' she said.

<HEAD>Marines Practice Everything, Even Getting Wounded in Battle</HEAD>

   When the U.S. Marines practice
war, they also practice treating and transporting the wounded.
   A mock invasion wouldn't be real without mock casualties.
   ``It does bring back the reality of the whole thing,'' said
Capt. Robert Chaney, who is responsible for all of the Marines'
medical assets in Saudi Arabia. ``People get hurt. Occasionally,
they die. We have to learn to handle both.
   ``The Marines hav a saying. We fight the way we train. Well, we
treat patients the way we practice,'' Chaney said.
   Even though the amphibious portion of Imminent Thunder was
called off Monday because of 14-foot seas, the Marines held mass
casualty drills involving about 80 simulated wounded at five field
hospitals.
   Twenty patients were flown by helicopter to Foxtrot Co. Surgical
Support, the northernmost of the field hospitals.
   Stretcher bearers scrambled into action after a siren wailed.
They carried the incoming through clouds of powdery sand kicked up
by helicopter blades, practicing skills the way an infantryman
practices with a rifle.
   ``Practice dying,'' said Lance Cpl. Jimmy O. Hall of Atlanta,
one of the mock casualties brought to the emergency room.
   It took just 20 minutes for the first Marine to pass from triage
to pre-op to one of five operating rooms. ``There's probably not an
emergency room in the states that can beat that time,'' Chaney
said.
   No matter how much surgeons work on being prepared, nothing can
ready them for the carnage they'll see if real war breaks out,
according to Lt. Cmdr. Chris Kain of Bremerton, Wash.
   Kain, one of four orthopedic surgeons at Foxtrot, said even the
knifings and the shootings he treated from the drug wars in U.S.
emergency rooms can't compare with the killing tools assembled in
war.
   ``We're going to be overwhelmed,'' Kain said. ``We're used to
seeing those kinds of wounds, but not at such huge, huge volumes.
None of us has encountered this tremendous volume.''
   He described surgery under such conditions this way: ``It's fast
and dirty. We used to call it slash and dash. Are we scared?
Absolutely. Can we handle it? Yes.''
   For the Marines brought here as part of their training, the
experience of make-believe wounds was unsettling.
   ``War could start tomorrow. I always have that in the back of my
mind,'' said Lance Cpl. Richard Flores, 20, of Anaheim, Calif.
   He had a simulated broken arm, and he said from his stretcher:
``I hope if we do go to combat I don't see this place again.''
   Doctors take the drills very seriously, according to Lt. Cmdr.
Steve Meister of San Diego, who runs the triage operation.
   ``We don't want anybody to die because of something we didn't
do,'' he said.
   The field hospital, which has fewer than 100 beds but can be
expanded, is lacking in amenities.
   The triage floor is desert sand. Operating rooms and intensive
care units are under green canvas tents covered with camouflage
netting. The dust kicked up in the desert sometimes settles on
medical equipment.
   ``You don't have to have tile walls and beautiful furniture to
make a hospital,'' Chaney said.
   But there is a sobering reminder of what can happen. One tent at
the hospital is designated as the morgue. Two corpsmen have
volunteered to work there.
   ``Yes, we have a morgue. That bottom line is that's a reality of
war,'' Chaney said. ``Hopefully, we'll have very few of those. War
is still war.''

   A building construction site in downtown
Washington caved in Monday night and firefighters tried to
determine if anyone was trapped in the hole.
   Three construction trailers and a van, parked on the sidewalk on
in the street adjacent to the site, tumbled into the cavity at 14th
and H Streets Northwest, two blocks north of the National Press
Club and four blocks from the White House, fire officials said.
   Fire Chief Ray Alfred told reporters, ``We think we may have
seen some movement in the hole'' with a device designed to detect
body heat.
   But it was not certain that anyone was trapped. Alfred said an
employee of the contractor told firefighters he was the last person
to leave the site.
   Special teams were readied to descend into the hole on ropes as
officials sought to determine whether the site was vulnerable to
further collapse.
   The Fire Department ordered the evacuation of an office building
next to the excavation containing the headquarters of United Press
International, said department spokesman Ted Holmes.
   ``There is still some movement'' of soil, Holmes said, pointing
to a fire hydrant next to the eacuated building.
   The subsurface pipe feeding the hydrant was bare. But until
11:20 p.m., nearly three hours after the cave-in, the pipe had been
surrounded with earth.
   The square excavation appeared to be about 30 yards on a side
and workers said it was four stories deep. Darkness and the
distance spectators were kept from the site prevented detailed
observation of the rubble inside.
   Fire officials said the 8:30 p.m. cave-in apparently was set off
by the vibrations of a faulty transformer, whose spectacular arcing
could be seen for blocks.
   ``It lit up the whole sky,'' said one construction worker, who
would not give his name.
   Service was suspended on a subway line running past the area,
with trains turning back at nearby stations on either side. Buses
were called to carry passengers between the Metro Center and
Farragut West stations.
   The subway line was in no danger, officials. Rather they feared
the effect of vibrations from passing trains.
   One man was killed in another cave-in at the site earlier this
year.

   The U.S. economy will no longer get $10
billion a month in investments from Japan, Germany and other
nations because they now need the money at home, specialists say.
   But the money will be less needed here because the federal
budget deficit is going down and fewer U.S. bonds will need to be
sold to foreigners, the specialists said Monday at a meeting of the
Institute for International Economics, a private study group.
   Americans are earning more foreign money by selling goods abroad
because the dollar has declined in value and made the U.S. goods
attractive for foreigners to buy.
   Some of the foreign money has gone into such projects as the
Japanese purchase of Rockefeller Center in New York and made for
bad feeling between the two countries. The Japanese had to buy the
dollars needed for that purchase and many others by selling yen.
   Americans needed the yen to pay for goods they bought in Japan.
As Americans sell more goods, they will have more yen at their
disposal.
   The need for foreign funds could rise if war starts in the
Persian Gulf at a cost estimated as high as $30 billion a month,
said Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional
Budget Office.
   Otherwise, Penner saw the current slowdown in business as a
short one, although the recovery sluggish if major companies have
trouble finding the new capital they will need.
   Robert D. Hormats, a former assistant secretary of state, said
Japan and Germany will be using more of their money at home.
Japanese banks are having problems because the prices of stocks and
real estate have gone down, he explained. Japan is also under
international pressure to spend less abroad and more on increasing
its own people's living standards.
   ``The estimated cost of German unification has now gone up to
140 billion marks (about $95 billion),'' Hormats said. ``Probably
it'll go up again.''
   He agreed with Penner that war in the gulf would bring economic
and well as human and political problems. ``War has a voracious
appetite for capital,'' said Hormats, who is vice chairman of
Goldman Sachs International, a leading investment bank.
   William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the economics institute,
said the U.S. need for foreign money has declined because the drop
in the value of the dollar has made U.S. exports more attractive
and brought in more cash. Slower growth for the United States as a
whole slows down imports and the outflow of money to pay for them,
he noted.

<HEAD>Postal Unions' Demand Would Increase Stamp Prices, Management Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postal unions' pay raise demands would cost
$50 billion over the next three years and raise the price of stamps
to 43 cents, according to a top Postal Service negotiator.
   ``We don't take it as a very serious proposal. ... They're in a
fantasy land,'' Assistant Postmaster General David Charters said
Monday, noting that the service's annual budget is $40 billion.
   The Postal Service and its four largest unions, which together
represent 660,000 workers, were working against a deadline of
midnight tonight to reach a compromise for a new contract.
   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union, said
Postal Service officials are ``the ones who are not in the real
world.'' He said management always predicts huge stamp increases
during contract bargaining to win the public's support.
   ``They predicted a 50-cent stamp in 1981 - it never happened,''
Biller said. Stamps now cost 25 cents.
   If no agreement is reached by midnight tonight, the two sides
could agree to continue talks or allow the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service to appoint a neutral arbitrator.
   Under federal law, it is illegal for postal workers to strike.
   The Postal Service is offering a two-year contract that provides
cash bonuses of $450 the first year and $500 the second year. In
addition, the Postal Service would implement a pay incentive plan
in which workers could receive bonuses of up to $1,100 a year if
their divisions met certain customer satisfaction and budget goals.
   Management's plan would provide cost of living increases only if
inflation rose more than 4 percent. For instance, if inflation rose
6 percent, workers would get a 2 percent raise. So far this year,
the government's inflation gauge has risen 6.7 percent.
   Biller, whose union has 334,000 members, has called management's
offer of cash bonuses but no hourly wage increases ``a piece of
garbage designed to pit worker against worker.''
   Biller said the union would reject the Postal Service's offer of
no cost of living increase before a 4 percent inflation rate.
   Letter carriers and clerks receive a starting salary of about
$24,000 and can earn up to about $31,500. Employees receive an
additional $8,560 in benefits and premium pay.
   The service, no longer subsidized by taxpayers, must break even
over time. Its board of governors has proposed raising the cost of
mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring.
   Despite the huge gap in the two sides' positions, Charters and
Biller said they were optimistic a deal could be struck by tonight.
   The other unions negotiating are the National Letter Carriers
Union, with 234,000 members; the National Postal Mail Handlers
Union, which represents 50,000 mail handlers; and the National
Rural Letter Carriers Association, with about 42,000 members.

   The National Weather Service is
offering the public a look at weather at least 100 years into the
past and at least a few years into the future at its new Science
and History Center.
   Weather Service Director Elbert W. Friday Jr., said the agency
is passing through an ``absolutely fantastic'' time, with new
technology involving computers, radar, satellites and better
communications leading to major changes in the agency. All the
changes can be observed at the new museum, which opened Monday in
this Washington suburb.
   One display looks back at weather work a century ago, recreating
the Agriculture Department's 1891 weather observation office from
Cairo, Ill.
   ``Some of those instruments look very familiar to me,'' John A.
Knauss, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, quipped of the antique thermometer, barometer and
rain gauge on display.
   At the other end of the scale are operating satellite and radar
displays, showing national weather patterns and specific events in
the Washington area.
   Dramatic photos of storm scenes line one wall of the new museum
on the ground floor of the Weather Service's new headquarters
building.
   Another wall is glass, affording a view of whatever weather is
happening at the moment.
   Video monitors provide the satellite and radar displays along
with current forecasts for the area.
   Other displays include:
   -A model of a NOAA hurricane hunter airplane.
   -A transportable tornado research instrument designed to be
placed in the path of tornadoes to measure the wind and pressure
within the twisters. These Transportable Tornado Observatories are
known as ``Toto,'' after the little dog caught up in the tornado in
``The Wizard of Oz.''
   -A scale model of one of NOAA's weather satellites, constructed
by students at the Unionville, Pa., high school.
   -A bank of telephones hooked to NOAA weather radio, providing
current forecasts for the Washington area.

<HEAD>Teamsters in Turmoil Over Aide's Firing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top aide to retiring Teamsters' President
William McCarthy says he was fired because he decided to run for
the presidency himself rather than back McCarthy's choice for a
successor.
   Walter Shea, a 34-year Teamsters' veteran, said Monday that
McCarthy fired him on Friday after he told McCarthy he would seek
the union's top post in next year's government-supervised
elections.
   The firing has brought new turmoil to the union, prompting
complaints that McCarthy is trying to manipulate the election,
which was ordered by the Justice Department as part of the
settlement of its massive civil racketeering suit against the
union.
   Next year's election will be the first in the Teamsters' 87-year
history in which rank-and-file members vote for union leaders.
   McCarthy is ``on a vendetta. ... He is on a seek-and-destroy
mission. He would destroy the entire international union just to
get his way,'' said Jack Cox, a Teamsters' vice president from Los
Angeles who has been at odds with McCarthy.
   Phone calls to McCarthy's spokesman were not returned.
   Cox said he believes that McCarthy, who decided to retire for
health reasons, fired Shea because Shea refused to back McCarthy's
``hand-anointed'' candidate, R.V. Durham of North Carolina.
   Shea, a Teamsters' vice president who has served every union
president since Jimmy Hoffa, said that after he told McCarthy he
was running for president, McCarthy ``advised me to clean out my
desk `because you're not loyal to me.'''
   The job from which McCarthy was fired paid about $75,000 a year;
he will continue to receive his vice presidential salary of about
$75,000.
   At a Teamsters' board meeting last month, McCarthy announced he
would retire, citing personal reasons. That prompted a majority of
the board, with McCarthy's approval, to endorse Durham, a union
vice president, as the candidate to replace McCarthy.
   The December 1991 elections were agreed to by the union board
last year as part of the settlement of a massive civil racketeering
suit brought by the Justice Department. Over the last several
months, court-appointed officers have moved to oust local union
leaders still accused of organized crime ties.
   The elections will be secret ballot voting by the 1.6 million
union members. In previous elections, only union leaders got to
vote.
   Shea said he decided to run for the union's top post because he
thought the troubled union needed new leadership.
   ``The way people perceive this union today is rather dim. I
think it's attributable in part to our leadership. I think I could
change that around,'' he said. ``I'm not coming in from a truck or
a local or the left field or the right field. With the right
leadership, I think we can turn this union around.''
   Besides Durham and Shea, Ron Carey, a local president from New
York, is mounting an independent campaign for the Teamsters'
presidency.

<HEAD>New Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan To Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MALE, Maldives (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barely two weeks in office, the prime
ministers of India and Pakistan meet on Wednesday in the first
top-level contact in two years between their antagonistic,
neighboring nations.
   The timing of their meeting at a summit conference of the South
Asia Association of Regional Cooperation so soon after each took
office is a coincidence. No one expects them to start tackling the
problems which last spring brought their countries to the brink of
their fourth war in 43 years.
   Chandra Shekhar was installed as prime minister in New Delhi on
Nov. 10 after the government of V.P. Singh collapsed.
   Nawaz Sharif took office in Pakistan three days earlier
following the ouster of the Benazir Bhutto government and a general
election.
   The three-day summit brings together two men with no experience
in foreign affairs who are preoccupied with domestic politics and
with their still unsettled governments.
   Under the rules of the association, it does not deal with
bilateral issues. Officials of both countries also say corridor
diplomacy will be minimal, with neither side ready to get into
tough questions.
   But the encounter could lead to a resumption of talks on
reducing tensions along the frontier, which saw the two armies
mobilized for war last April.
   ``It can happen that we will be authorized to meet again,'' said
India's senior diplomat, Muchkund Dubey.
   The talks, initiated through U.S. diplomacy, were interrupted by
the political upheavals in Islamabad and New Delhi. Two previous
sessions in July and August produced no visible gains.
   ``The differences between us are fundamental and substantive. We
are dealing with big, big issues,'' said a Pakistani diplomat,
speaking on condition he not be identified.
   The latest flare-up was over the province of Kashmir. Moslem
militants there are seeking to splinter off from Hindu-dominated
India, either to join Islamic Pakistan or to become independent.
   The long-simmering insurgency exploded into a guerrilla war in
January. Since then, more than 1,550 people have been killed and
economic activity has halted in what was once a highly popular
tourist spot.
   India accuses Pakistan of supplying arms and training to the
insurgents, and helping them slip across the mountainous frontier.
   Pakistan denies actively aiding the guerrillas, but supports
their cause diplomatically. It also suspects India of stirring up
troubles in its own Sind province.
   Previous talks failed because India limited them to practical
steps toward confidence-building, and Pakistan wanted to discuss
the underlying issue of the political future of Jammu and Kashmir
state.
   The two armies frequently traded artillery fire during the
summer. Both sides dismissed the incidents as minor.
   The South Asian association was formed six years ago, ostensibly
to promote regional projects and economic cooperation. It was also
a forum for the small countries to band together against what they
saw as Indian domination.
   Its concrete achievements are meager - an anti-terrorism
convention, a draft agreement on harmonizing narcotics laws, and
the lifting of visa requirements for Supreme Court justices and
members of parliaments.
   The conference comes at an unsettled time for all members except
the Maldives, a string of 1,190 idyllic coral islands south of
India with 200,000 people. The other six nations represent
one-fifth of the world's population, and are among the poorest
countries. Each is in transition.
   President R. Premadasa of Sri Lanka declined to attend the
summit, saying he could not leave as long as the ethnic war
continues between the dominant Sinhalese and the minority Tamils,
who want their own homeland.
   The war has claimed 14,000 lives in the last seven years.
   Bangladesh's president, former army Gen. Mohamed Hussain Ershad,
is facing a renewed challenge from opposition groups demanding his
resignation. Ershad seized power in 1982. His foes say the three
elections that kept him in office were rigged. They want him out
before the presidential vote due next year.
   King Birendra of Nepal yielded this spring to a popular uprising
for democracy, which killed at least 300 people. This month, he
promulgated a new constitution relinquishing his absolute power.
   Bhutan's King Jigme Singye Wangchuk is trying to preserve his
country's culture in the face of pressures from Nepalese
immigrants, who dislike laws demanding that they adopt Bhutanese
dress and language. Reports from the Himalayan kingdom speak of
dozens killed in clashes with police and of kidnapping by Nepalese
dissidents.
   Indian political analyst Bhabani Sen Gupta wrote in New Delhi
that stability in each country is a prerequisite for raising the
region from the economic and social basement.
   If the summit can ``cool down ... narrow nationalist and
sectarian passions,'' he said, ``it will have made its name in the
history of South Asia.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Bankers Tightening on Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers are getting increasingly cautious
about making loans, particularly to commercial real estate
developers but also to other corporate borrowers and home buyers, a
Federal Reserve Board survey finds.
   Compared with a similar poll three months earlier, the latest
survey ``generally painted a picture of increased credit restraint,
with agencies and branches of foreign banks reporting more
tightening than domestic banks,'' the central bank said Monday.
   ``The pullback was least evident in consumer and home mortgage
lending and was clearest in commercial real estate lending, a
category for which a large majority of respondents continued to
raise their credit standards,'' it said.
   The October survey of senior loan officers at 60 large banks
comes as Bush administration officials are showing growing concern
that a shortage of credit is deepening the economic downturn.
   Financial institutions and some borrowers have complained for
months that bank and savings and loan examiners have overreacted to
the thrift crisis by discouraging even sound loans. The regulators,
however, say they are only urging prudence in response to the
weaker economy.
   President Bush met with top administration officials on the
situation last week. Chief of staff John Sununu, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher and budget director Richard Darman reportedly said
the examiners should ease up, while Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan argued that the closer
scrutiny of lending is appropriate.
   ``There perhaps have been some regulators that have been
overzealous at times,'' said Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic
adviser.
   ``We need to make sure they are prudent and do enforce the
safety requirements ... but I think it is likely the case that
some, seeing the S&amp;L situaion, have perhaps inadvertently
overreacted,'' Boskin said when asked about Monday's survey at a
National Press Club lunch.
   He added that some banks have been forced to make fewer loans in
response to stricter capital standards taking effect Jan. 1 under
an international accord.
   Banks that cannot raise additional capital have little choice
but to restrict the number of new loans they make while they build
their capital gradually by retaining earnings.
   Nearly two-thirds of the respondents in the Fed poll reported
tightening lending standards for commercial real estate loans,
while almost half of the respondents had tightened lending
standards for non-real estate commercial and industrial loans to
large corporations.
   They most often cited ``a deterioration in the economic
outlook'' and ``problems specific to individual industries'' for
the greater restraint, the report said. About one-fifth of the
banks surveyed said their capital position restricted new lending,
while two-thirds said it had no effect.
   ``Home mortgage lending remained relatively favored,'' the
Federal Reserve said. But it noted that more U.S. banks,
particularly in the Northeast, are reporting tighter standards even
for those loans.
   About one in four of the banks said they were either requiring a
higher down payment on home mortgages or had raised the household
income needed to qualify for a loan.
   ``In sum, the results of this lending practices survey suggest
that a deterioration in the general economic outlook since summer
has prompted a sizable share of domestic respondents to tighten
credit standards more,'' the central bank said.
   In addition to scrutinizing borrowers more closely, about half
the banks said they had raised their loan fees and charged a bigger
spread over base interest rates. Between one-third and one-half are
requiring better collateral.

<HEAD>Officials: Joint Operation Practically Wipes Out Hawaii Marijuana
Crop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii's billion-dollar marijuana industry has
been dealt a potentially fatal blow by a federal, state and county
crackdown that used space-age surveillance and pinpoint aerial
spraying of herbicide, authorities say.
   About 90 percent of Hawaii's summer marijuana crop has been
destroyed in Operation Wipeout, the biggest joint agency crackdown
in Hawaii history and one of the largest in the nation, state
Attorney General Warren Price said Monday.
   ``Law enforcement intelligence sources report that the industry
is now in shambles, with growers leaving the state or turning to
legitimate businesses,'' Price said.
   In three months, the statewide operation that had the blessing
of just-resigned drug policy chief William Bennett destroyed
785,000 plants worth $1.1 billion on the street, officials said.
   Price said the sweep was made possible by ``space-age
intelligence gathering and photo identification methods.''
   He declined to say whether that meant military satellites were
used to pinpoint the marijuana crops, saying only that information
on the Pentagon's involvement was classified.
   Marijuana, or ``pakalolo,'' is the state's No. 1 cash crop and
is grown year-round, mostly on the island of Hawaii. The state is
among the biggest pot producers in the nation.
   Price said the entire state was photograhed in grids. Once
marijuana-growing areas were identified, herbicide was sprayed from
helicopters or officers uprooted the plants.
   Price said the areas would be checked periodically to ensure
more pot is not planted. Checks over the past few weeks turned up
only one replanted plot, he said.
   ``The marijuana industry in Hawaii is not yet dead, but it is
severely wounded,'' Price said. ``Over the next several months we
feel we can destroy the remnants of the industry and eliminate it
in its entirety once and for all.''
   William Paty, director of the state Department of Land and
Natural Resources, said herbicide nozzles developed by the
department were a key weapon.
   The nozzle, attached to a hose suspended from the belly of a
helicopter, allows pinpoint eradication of marijuana plants in
remote areas without harming nearby foliage, he said.
   Joseph Parra, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in
Hawaii, said Operation Wipeout has driven the street price of
Hawaii marijuana from between $1,600 and $2,200 a pound to between
$4,600 and $6,000 a pound.
   Hawaii officials have previously been criticized as being too
easy on marijuana growers.
   Besides serving as an example for other states, Operation
Wipeout
   ``could be used to show foreign governments that we're trying to
resolve our drug problems at home, and not just asking them to
spray their plants,'' Parra said.

   The leaders have come to make peace in Europe. For
all but the privileged thousands who have security or press reasons
to penetrate security barriers, it's a short television spectacle.
   On Monday afternoon, a few dozen people wanted actually to see
the leaders step from their limousines at the congress center at
Avenue Kleber, a few hundred yards from the Arc de Triomphe in
Paris.
   They couldn't even get close. One of the 10,000 or so policemen
deployed around Paris in uniform or disguised as street sweepers
and vendors even had the grace to smile.
   ``I know it's madness,'' he said. ``But I can do nothing.''
   ---
   Gorbachev warned in his speech Monday that ethnic conflicts
could have ``a destructive snowball effect,'' especially if
separatists achieve changes in the borders adopted after World War
II in Europe.
   The Helsinki Final Act of 1975, the basis of the process
celebrated by 34 participating nations at their current summit,
aimed to make those borders final, regardless of the many border
changes of the past and still raging rival ethnic claims.
   But what of borders inside countries? They apparently are not
included.
   And so, on Monday, the foreign ministers of the three Baltic
republics were rejected as summit observers, because the Soviet
Union - of which they are nominally part - rejected their claim to
any kind of independent voice.
   ---
   The Baltics and isolationist Albania, already an observer but
lacking full membership, craved a place at the summit table. So,
apparently, did an uninvited guest - Saddam Hussein.
   The Iraqi leader, probably aware that President Bush would use
Paris as a forum to muster yet more international support for his
policy in the Persian Gulf, used Sunday and Monday to announce what
appeared to be major moves.
   Questions about Iraq's decision to start releasing foreign
hostages before Christmas and its move to deploy up to 250,000 more
troops in Kuwait peppered every news conference, overshadowing
peace rhetoric and the historic accord to slash conventional arms.
   ``Saddam Hussein invites himself to Paris,'' the Paris daily
Liberation commented Monday.
   ---
   And, indeed, Saddam's shadow cast a pall not seen from the sunny
sky in Paris on Monday. It is the shadow of war.
   The leaders want to preserve the peace they came to celebrate.
From Gorbachev to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and even Bush and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who are more forthright
than others about the need to use force in the Persian Gulf if
necessary, they advocated peaceful solution.
   But the Paris summit in the name of peace and prosperity also
had to examine the paradoxical proposition that force may be needed
to preserve both.
   Gorbachev summed up the quandary facing the leaders in Paris.
   ``We all need patience,'' he said at a picture session before
dinner with Bush, ``but that does not mean that we are going to
weaken or retreat.''

<HEAD>American and Canadian Refugees Arrive from Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi occupiers of Kuwait ``can kill you
for any reason,'' says one of the 84 American and Canadian refugees
newly evacuated from the Persian Gulf country.
   The 75 Americans and nine Canadians arrived Monday night at
Dulles International Airport outside Washington.
   Three of the passengers were taken to a hospital but officials
said there were no serious medical problems. Authorities took the
rest of the exhausted refugees to a hotel near the airport.
   The passengers were not hostages but had been living in Kuwait
since before the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq.
   A Kuwaiti accompanying his four American-born children said,
``There are random arrests, killings sometimes. They can kill you
for any reason. They may arrest anybody. Maybe they don't like his
car. They may inflict harm on his body, torture.''
   ``The Iraqi government is implementing many internal policies to
force the people out of their country,'' said the man, who would
not give his name. ``By driving or walking, you are putting
yourself in a position where you could be arrested, beaten or
killed.''
   One 35-year-old woman said she had been hoping for American
troops to come to her rescue.
   ``For the past three and a half months, I have gotten up hoping
and praying they would come,'' she said. But a 36-year-old
Palestinian accompanied by his two American daughters expressed
doubts about the wisdom of using force.
   ``I don't know, force will kill a lot of people,'' he said. ``It
will mean mass destruction.'' The two asked that their names not be
used.
   Health and Human Services Department spokesman Steve Siegel said
75 Americans and their dependents were aboard - 16 men, 16 women
and 43 children. He said there were nine Canadians - two men, four
women and three children.
   The refugees were among 136 on a flight from Iraq that landed
earlier Monday at London's Gatwick Airport.
   The Loudoun County disaster services director, Tom Berezoski,
said two children had minor infections and one adult was in a
wheelchair, but otherwise everyone seemed healthy.
   Children who arrived on the flight were ``sitting in a
semi-circle watching TV. It's like they haven't watched in years,''
said Berezoski.
   ``Most of the passengers on this flight have been qualified to
depart for some time but have only recently decided to leave,''
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters at the
airport.
   He said the flight brought to about 2,250 the number of American
citizens and their relatives evacuated since the crisis began.
   Passengers of nine other nationalities had been aboard the
flight that arrived in London from Baghdad. A number of the
passengers on that flight told reporters they could not stand
conditions in the emirate since the takeover by Iraq.

<HEAD>Leading Reformer Appeals to West for Emergency Food Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Leningrad, one of the Soviet Union's
leading reformers, has appealed to the West for emergency aid to
avoid famine and prevent public opinion from turning against
democratic reforms.
   ``Already, a lot of people are saying, `Let's go back to the way
things were under Brezhnev - at least then there was food in the
stores,''' said the leader of the country's second largest city,
Anatoly A. Sobchak.
   In recent days, Sobchak, 53, has been mentioned as a possible
candidate for the new post of vice president in President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reorganized government.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, he said he
had not been approached about the job. He skirted the issue of
whether he would accept if Gorbachev offered it, saying he did not
expect to be chosen and had no desire for a permanent career in
politics.
   Sobchak, a member of the Supreme Soviet legislature and former
law professor, is the first high-level Soviet official to appeal
publicly for food donations from the West.
   He said some people in Leningrad had accused him of being too
proud to ask for help, but that for the good of the city, he would
be willing to ``get down on my knees'' if necessary.
   Germany promised Gorbachev during his visit last week that it
would provide emergency food aid to help the Soviet Union through
the winter, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Monday that rail
shipments could begin as early as next week.
   Sobchak said a private U.S. organization, AmeriCares, was also
preparing shipments.
   The mayor visited the United States in October and met with
President Bush at the White House. He said he regretted that he did
not ask for emergency aid at that time.
   ``A month ago, I thought we could avoid foreign aid. Today, I
think we can't,'' he said. ``The food situation has worsened, and
by the time we take steps to increase stockpiles and improve
distribution, we could already have placed our major cities ... in
danger of famine.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on Monday that the
U.S. government had not received a formal request for help.
   But Bush, meeting other leaders at a summit conference in Paris,
indicated he would favor humanitarian aid.
   ``If there are food shortages, for example, and the United
States was in a position to help, clearly I would want to try to
help,'' he said. ``And that's the right and humane thing to do as a
country moves towards us and relations are greatly improved.''
   At Sobchak's urging, Leningrad's City Council voted last week to
begin rationing meat, poultry, eggs, flour, butter and other
staples starting Dec. 1 in the city of about 5 million people.
   Many other cities throughout Russia and the Ukraine already
ration food, vodka, matches, soap and other necessities.
   Sitting under a portrait of Lenin in his Moscow legislative
office, Sobchak said Communist Party officials are deliberately
preventing food from being distributed efficiently.
   ``We are facing opposition - possibly the last gasp of
opposition - from the old Communist, totalitarian, administrative
system against the new democratic system that is being born,'' he
said.
   He added that if there is widespread hunger this winter, popular
sentiment could turn against the reforms that Gorbachev has
introduced since coming to power in 1985.
   ``People are asking ... `What good is this democracy to me, when
I've got nothing to eat?''' he said.
   Sobchak spoke enthusiastically about the government
reorganization proposed by Gorbachev on Saturday.
   He said eliminating the Council of Ministers, headed by Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, would give the president a clear line of
administrative authority independent of the Communist Party,
allowing Gorbachev to take ``more decisive action'' to improve the
economy.
   At the same time, Sobchak called for a radical reduction in the
role of the central government, saying its function should be only
as a ``coordinator and arbiter'' between autonomous Soviet
republics that voluntarily remain within the union.

<HEAD>Consumer Commission Seeking Labeling Of Toys With Small Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Products Safety Commission,
issuing its annual holiday warning about dangerous toys, says it
may go for regulations requiring labeling of playthings with small
parts that could choke children if swallowed.
   ``Think big in buying toys for children under 3,'' Jacqueline
Jones-Smith, chairman of the commission, said Monday at a news
conference.
   The commission said it received reports of 33 deaths related to
toys between January 1989 and September 1990. In 20 of these cases,
the children choked on balloons, marbles, small balls or parts of
toys.
   ``The buyer has to beware and parents have to be careful,'' Ms.
Jones-Smith said.
   She said the commission has taken the first steps toward
developing mandatory requirements for labeling on balloons, balls
and marbles.
   In addition, she said, the commission has begun action that may
result in a requirement that toys having small pieces, intended for
children aged 3 to 6, be labeled to warn of the choking hazards to
younger children.
   The commission's staff hopes to have these regulations before
the commission for consideration early next year, she said.
   Ms. Jones-Smith demonstrated two toys with small parts for
reporters and announced that the manufacturers have agreed to
voluntarily recall them from the market.
   During the past year, she said, about 198 kinds of toy have been
recalled or stopped from sale.
   In a statement distributed at the news conference, the
commission also said it has seized about 3 million toys at ports of
entry since it began a cooperative program with the Customs Service
in 1987.
   ``The industry itself is policing itself much better in recent
years, partly because of its own sensitivity and party because of
our work with Customs,'' said David Schmeltzer, director of
compliance for the commission.
   Ms. Jones-Smith said most of the toys the commission deals with
are imported.

<TEXT>
   Having mounted a pugnacious campaign
against a government he largely created, Lech Walesa is presenting
himself as a man vindicated by events and predicts victory in
Sunday's presidential elections.
   ``I was born only for victory. So I have to win,'' Walesa
declared in an interview with The Associated Press at his
headquarters Monday.
   Polls show Walesa ahead of his chief rival and former ally,
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. But with four others in the
field, it was unclear if anyone would get a first-round majority
and avoid a runoff Dec. 9.
   The 47-year-old Solidarity chairman accused his opponents of
talking only about his personality and ambitions, not substantive
issues.
   ``I am waiting for a political discussion while my partners are
saying that I have dirty fingernails and so try to discourage
people from voting for me,'' Walesa said.
   Walesa, who picked Mazowiecki for prime minister in August 1989
after the long-ruling Communists suffered a humiliating electoral
defeat, said he was laughed at early this year when he urged the
government to pick up the speed of reforms.
   He said he saw that dramatic stes were needed, including
purging government and industry of Communists.
   ``My colleagues - dangerous politicians - were carrying out a
dangerous policy which was on the edge of civil war. I made an
attempt to save us ... to save reform,'' Walesa said.
   The Mazowiecki camp argues that Poland's delicate transition to
full democracy could be thwarted if the government engages in a
large-scale ``witch hunt'' for ex-Communists.
   Virtually all of Walesa's former advisers have sided with
Mazowiecki, leaving Walesa to assemble a new team of unionists and
lesser-known politicians.
   ``I have been struggling for nine months to regain Solidarity's
position and to regain my position. I do not know to what extent it
worked, but from what I see, it did,'' Walesa said.
   A peasant's son with a trade-school education, Walesa said he
differs from his former colleagues, most of them intellectuals,
because he is not frightened by ordinary people.
   ``If you fear the masses, then of course the masses will defeat
you,'' he said.
   ``I am not afraid of the masses. I want to find work for them,
and I want to show them what's possible or impossible, and then go
on with what's possible and probable.''
   His former allies may quarrel with him now, Walesa said, but
they will see he was right.
   ``I am playing like a chess player, five or six moves ahead, and
my colleagues can see only one move. That is why they are scared.''
   Once he is elected, Walesa said, he will move to patch up the
splintered Solidarity movement.
   While he has called for faster reforms, he said that as
president he would avoid abrupt changes until a freely elected
parliament is seated, which could take two or three months, he
said.
   ``Until the elections, as few changes as possible, only the
necessary changes. Because to the outside world, it always (looks
like) change upon change, from one change to another.''
   Walesa has recently been full of praise for Finance Minister
Leszek Balcerowicz, but he sidestepped a question on whether he
would ask Balcerowicz to stay.
   Walesa said he would offer part of the Cabinet the option to
remain, but wouldn't appeal to them with hat in hand.
   ``The point is reform of the country, patriotism and full
devotion, and not to me but to Poland,'' Walesa said.
   ``If someone needs to be asked, it means he's useless,'' he
said.
   Asked why he had not done more to rebuke anti-Semitism during
his rallies, Walesa said he had reminded Poles in recent interviews
that anti-Semitism is contradictory to their Catholicism.
   Mazowiecki, who contends Poland's future depends on maintaining
his course of cautious reforms, says he'll join the opposition if
Walesa wins.

<TEXT>
   Army failed to get Navy's goat.
   Early Sunday, cadets from the U.S. Military Academy abducted a
goat they thought was Bill XXVI, the U.S. Naval Academy mascot.
   But the midshipmen had been anticipating the prank and proved to
be great kidders.
   The real Bill had been hidden by midshipmen.
   The Naval Academy said Monday the kid-napped goat was one of
several that had auditioned to succeed Bill XXV, who was retired in
1988.
   Faux goat, as the Navy is calling the kidnapped one, had been
rejected because it was ornery and had poor bathroom habits.
   ``We sort of hope they keep Faux goat,'' said Rear Adm. Virgil
L. Hill Jr., Naval Academy superintendent. ``He would do well at
West Point. His personality will fit right in there.''
   Kid-nappings are tradition before the annual Army-Navy football
game. The 100th anniversary of the first Army-Navy game will be
celebrated when the teams meet on Dec. 8 in Philadelphia.
   The kidnappers left a ransom note that said Bill would be
``cared for at a farm ... and will be warm, well-fed and dry.''
   ``We take this as a win,'' said Naval Academy spokeswoman Carol
Feldman.
   Bill's whereabouts remain a military secret.

   A Chicago company is recalling more than five
tons of hot dogs suspected of being contaminated by food poisoning.
   Agriculture Department officials said on Monday that David Berg
&amp; Co. is recalling 10,000 pounds of bulk-packed ``David Berg Beef
Frankfurters'' distributed in California, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania and Texas.
   Also being recalled are about 1,400 pounds of retail-packaged
``David Berg Deli Beef Franks'' distributed in the Chicago
metropolitan area.
   The franks may be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, an
organism that can cause listeriosis, which was described as ``a
rare but potentially serious disease.''
   The bulk-packed hot dogs are sold in 10-pound boxes and are
distributed to hot dog vendors, delicatessens and restaurants.
``EST. 1'' appears inside the USDA inspection seal on the box
label. All bulk franks with the code 60250 on the bottom of the box
are being recalled.
   The 12-ounce retail packages were distributed to grocery stores
and supermarkets in Chicago. ``EST. 1'' appears in the inspection
seal on the package label. All retail packages with ``Sell by Dec.
10'' stamped on the side of the package are being recalled.
   None of the company's other products are involved in the recall,
said Ronald J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service.

   The Corcoran Gallery of Art, in turmoil since
the cancellation of a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit, has named a New
York art historian and education administrator as its new leader.
   David C. Levy, chancellor of he New School for Social Research,
was elected by the Corcoran board of trustees Monday to become
director and president of the gallery and the art school affiliated

   Levy, 52, joined the Parsons School of Design in 1961. He

continued as Parsons' chief administrative officer until last year.
   Levy's appointment was announced in conjunction with a policy
statement in which the board reaffirmed the Corcoran's commitment
to freedom of expression.
   The Corcoran, 120 years old and two blocks from the White House,
attracted nationwide criticism when its former director, Christina
Orr-Cahall, canceled an exhibit containing sexually explicit
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   She said she canceled the show to avoid getting embroiled in the
emotional debate over federal arts grant policies. But the
cancellation ignited an equally intense debate in the artistic
community, and Orr-Cahall resigned last February.

<HEAD>Researchers Accuse FDA Of Imperiling Supply Of French Abortion</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Drug
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical researchers say the Food and Drug
Administration is threatening access to a French abortion drug that
shows promise in treating cancer and other diseases.
   Dr. George P. Chrousos of the National Institute of Child Health
and Development told a House hearing Monday that scientists are
being ``whiplashed by the FDA decision'' to issue an import alert
on the French drug RU-486.
   ``I won't be able to initiate a new study'' because of the
uncertain supply of RU-486, Chrousos said. He said the reluctance
by the French company, Roussel-Uclaf, to supply it for research in
this country was ``unethical.''
   The drug has shown promise in treating breast and brain cancer,
Cushing's Syndrome and other diseases. Cushing's Syndrome is a
disorder of the pituitary gland.
   The FDA got ``carried away'' under pressure from the
right-to-life movement and ``may have made a political decision,''
Chrousos added.
   The FDA issued an import alert in June 1989 barring the abortion
drug for personal use after getting inquiries from right-to-life
groups and a dozen members of Congress who oppose abortion,
including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif.
   Since then, some U.S. researchers have had difficulty getting
the drug from its French manufacturer, which fears its business
could suffer if it becomes embroiled in an abortion controversy.
   The regulatory agency's import alert was not a politically
motivated decision, the FDA's Ronald G. Chesemore told the House
subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy.
   The FDA didn't consult leading U.S. researchers before issuing
the import alert, testified Dr. Kathryn Horwitz, a professor of
medicine at the University of Colorado.
   The FDA announced the alert 19 days after demands for it from
members of Congress.
   ``This certainly must be a new land-speed record for an agency
response to congressional inquiries,'' observed subcommittee
chairman Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. He called FDA's action ``very
irresponsible.''
   Wyden suggested that Health and Human Services Department
Secretary Louis Sullivan urge the French company to ensure adequate
supplies of the drug for U.S. research.

<HEAD>Soccer Headers Can Result in Brain Damage, Study Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Oslo University medical student says he's
determined that soccer players who use their heads to strike at
balls are risking brain damage.
   Thirty percent of retired Norwegian soccer players were found to
have signs of minor brain damage from ``heading'' balls, according
to the survey medical student Alf Thorvald Tysvaer conducted for
his doctoral thesis.
   Tysvaer said in an interview with the news agency NPK that 3
percent of the active Norwegian soccer players he studied also
showed symptoms of brain damage. Soccer balls can travel at more
than 60 mph.
   But Willy Simonssen, assistant head of Norway's Soccer
Federation, said such widespread damage appeared unlikely.
   ``I have not noticed it in my meetings with players,'' he said.
   In the study, former players complained of headache, dizziness
and irritability and some had problems with pain in the neck,
Tysvaer was quoted as saying. He said those were symptoms of
chronic, or permanent, brain damage.
   But the brain changes he recorded were not as severe as those
suffered by boxers, Tysvaer said.
   NPK said in the report Monday that Tysvaer's study included 69
active Norwegian division players and 43 former national team
members.

   The dollar edged down against the yen Tuesday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell moderately.
   The dollar closed at 128.93 yen, down 0.02 yen from Monday's
close of 128.95 yen. After opening at 129.23 yen, the currency
ranged between 128.90 yen and 129.28 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 312.68
points, or 1.33 percent, closing at 23,518.16. The market's main
barometer had gained 346.53 points the previous day.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 85.10, down from Monday's
close of 85.37. Their yield rose to 7.690 percent from 7.640
percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was bought during early
trading, then drifted because of dollar-selling in small amounts by
life insurance firms and other institutions.
   They said the dollar's initial strength followed Iraq's
announcement that it will increase its forces in Kuwait by 250,000
troops.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of unrest because it is seen
as a safe investment.
   On the stock market, the Iraqi announcement caused the Nikkei
index to drop more than 200 points in early trading, said Tsukasa
Wakihata, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   ``The index recovered some of its early losses following a news
report that Saudi Arabia will increase its oil production,''
Wakihata said.

Hollywood about the time the studios stopped making musicals.
   ``I loved those old film musicials,'' said Henderson, best known
as the matriarch of ``The Brady Bunch.'' ``I grew up in this tiny
town in southern Indiana where going to the movies was the biggest
excitement of the week. I wanted to be Jane Powell.''
   She even tried to break into show business as a singer, at a

less than successful, she recalled in a recent interview.
   ``I was such a kid. I didn't know you had to bring your own

she was singing `It's A Most Unusual Day' and on the other was a

   ```What are you going to sing?' Mr. Heidt asked. `These two

   NEW YORK (AP) - Paul Newman is donating $10,000 from his
Newman's Own line of food products to help keep a Ms. magazine
educational program cooking.
   The program, ``Ms.: the World of Women,'' provides copies of the
magazine for use in women's, sociology and psychology classes at
about 2,000 U.S. colleges.
   The magazine initially provided the copies for free. After Ms.
ran into financial troubles last year, people such as Newman began

   BOSTON (AP) - Rep. Barney Frank, noting there is no good time to
have a heart attack, says he's happy that at least his occurred
while Congress was out of session.
   The Massachusetts Democrat checked himself into Beth Israel
Hospital on Saturday after experiencing chest pains while working
out at a health club. Doctors unblocked a clogged artery on Sunday.
   ``There's no good time for something like this to happen, but at
least Congress is out now,'' Frank said in a statement issued from
the hospital Monday. ``That means I'll be back at work when
Congress is back in session.''
   Congress goes back into session in January.
   ``If progress continues at this rate, I anticipate a complete

   ``He's the first Little League graduate to be vice president,''
Little League spokesman Steve Keener said Monday.
   Induction ceremonies will be held Dec. 6 in Washington. Quayle

President Creighton J. Hale said.
   Quayle played baseball for the Herald-Press newspaper team in
the Hoosier Little League of Huntington, Ind., in the mid-1950s.
   Little League officials still have the vice president's

<HEAD>Demonstrators Charge Front is Behind New Communist Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GABRIEL PASLARU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government critics have taken to the
streets with charges that a new Communist party was created with
secret support from the governing National Salvation Front.
   More than 3,000 people marched two miles down Bucharest's main
boulevard on Monday, shouting anti-Communist slogans and railing
against the government.
   The new Communist party, called the Socialist Labor Party, was
formed last weekend through the merger of the tiny Democratic Labor
and Socialist parties, both created after the December revolution
that ousted and executed longtime dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The party, led by former Communist Premier Ilie Verdet,
describes itself as ``a reorganization, on a new basis, of the
former Romanian Communist Party.''
   In a statement Monday, the new party deplored ``intolerant
movements to discourage our constructive efforts'' and pledged to
``reject all Stalinist and Ceausescu-ist practices.''
   But critics were skeptical.
   ``The Communists have infiltrated all the structures of power
and quite naturally will try to return us to where we were
before,'' said Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, president of the Former
Political Prisoners Association.
   Many in the opposition have charged that the National Salvation
Front, which took power after the December revolution that ousted
Ceausescu, and its leader, President Ion Iliescu, are secret
Communists.
   The demonstrators Monday shouted ``Down with Iliescu!'' and
``The blood was spilled for nought!''
   Some carried a large banner that equated the government with
communism. It read: ``Romanian Communist Party - National Salvation
Front - Socialist Labor Party - Romanian Communist Party.''
   Iliescu and other front leaders, bowing to popular pressure that
sprung from hatred of Ceausescu, announced in January that
communism would be banned in Romania. Later, they backed away from
that position.
   A statement issued by the political prisoners' group charged
that ``almost all the top (Communist Party) members were freed
despite their crimes against humanity.'' It alleged that
Ceausescu's feared secret police, the Securitate, ``is intact and
on duty.''
   More than 100,000 Romanians demonstrated against the front on
Thursday to mark the third anniversary of anti-Ceausescu riots in
Brasov, 60 miles north of Bucharest, which were brutally
suppressed.
   Dissatisfaction with the front has grown since Nov. 1, when
price reforms introduced by Premier Petre Roman led to the doubling
and tripling of prices.
   The front on Sunday criticized Roman's reform package as not
doing enough to protect the social welfare of citizens.
   It was time the front had openly attacked Roman, whose
relationship to the government party is unclear. Roman said he was
resigning in July, but he has since presided over several meetings
of a front organization.

   Two of the American fliers she helped save
attended the funeral of Charline Chable Rotondo, a member of the
French underground awarded the Medal of Freedom for her World War
II exploits.
   Rotondo, who moved to the United States in 1974, died of lung
cancer Thursday at age 78. Her funeral was Monday.
   World War II fliers John Swenson of Newton, Mass., and Alvin
Little of Burlington, Vt., were among the 32 Americans Rotondo
sheltered from the Nazis.
   ``Without people like her, we would have been dead,'' Swenson
said. ``We would have starved to death, or turned ourselves in to
the Germans.''
   ``She went through as much hell as us,'' Little said.
   Rotondo received America's highest civilian honor in Paris in
1945 after she escaped from the Nazis, who had imprisoned and
tortured her. She was the first foreign-born woman to receive the
medal.
   Also attending her funeral were members of the 8th Air Force
Historical Society in Massachusetts and the Air Forces Escape and
Evasion Society, which reunited Rotondo, Swenson and Little in
1985.
   Swenson was the radio operator and Little a gunner on a bomber
that was shot down over France in 1943. After being rescued by two
Frenchmen, they were secretly moved from house to house, village to
village, across France.
   Little spent 12 weeks at Rotondo's home in Esbly outside Paris.
Swenson stayed there a week.
   One evening when Germans knocked on Rotondo's door, ``she kept
them occupied until I and her niece could slip out another door,''
Little said.
   Rotondo, a banker's daughter who was then 31, eventually was
captured herself. She was beaten, hung from rafters and burned with
cigarettes, but she told her captors nothing about the French
resistance.
   She escaped when a train carrying her to a concentration camp
was bombed by the Allies.
   After the war, the multilingual Sorbonne graduate became a
fashion designer and lived in Southeast Asia before moving to the
United States and settling in Salem.
   She sought in vain for 10 years to find any of the fliers she
helped, until the Escape and Evasion Society found her. Her medal
was displayed in her coffin.
   She is survived by her husband, Alfred Rotondo.

<HEAD>Leukemia Victim Whose Father Fought for Bone Marrow Transplant
Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old leukemia victim who was denied the
possibility of a bone marrow transplant from his 3-year-old half
siblings died without a fair chance against the disease or the
courts, his father says.
   Jean-Pierre Bosze died Monday at his suburban Hoffman Estates
home, ending his father's six-month legal battle to have the
teen-ager's twin half-siblings, a boy and a girl, tested as donors
for a bone marrow transplant that doctors said might have saved his
life.
   ``He was a very, very brave boy,'' said his father, Tamas Bosze.
``It's very unfortunate the way the law is now. I don't think he
had a fair chance.''
   Bosze had sought a court order to force Nancy Curran - his
former girlfriend and the mother of the twins - to have the
toddlers tested.
   Curran had claimed the tests would be too painful and risky. In
September, the state Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's ruling
in her favor. A request to reconsider its decision was before the
high court when Jean-Pierre died.
   The boy was released from Lutheran General Hospital in Park
Ridge last week, and both his mother and father were at his bedside
when he died, said Edward Jordan, Bosze's lawyer.
   ``He was at peace,'' Jordan said. ``He was as calm as he could
be. He didn't want to die. But he knew it was coming.''
   Jordan said Bosze feels no bitterness toward Curran, of suburban
Elk Grove.
   ``It's not anything like `You killed my kid,' nothing like
that,'' Jordan said. ``It's just that they'll never know'' if the
twins could have been donors. Blood relatives are more likely to be
biologically compatible donors.
   ``When he started out he was a good candidate to receive bone
marrow from anyone,'' the boy's father said. ``His condition got
worse, the twins were the only hope.''
   Curran's attorney, Beverly Pekala, issued a one-sentence
extending her client's sympathy.
   Healthy bone marrow must come from donors whose tissue types
closely match the patient's. Bosze approached Curran after tests
showed that he and three other family members were incompatible.
   Bosze, a tavern owner, fathered the twins with Curran when he
was separated from Jean-Pierre's mother, to whom he remains
married. Curran has sole custody of the twins.
   He initially petitioned the courts in June, insisting the twins
would agree to the tests if they were old enough to decide. Circuit
Judge Monica Reynolds ruled Sept. 6 that the tests would violate
the twins' right to privacy.
   Bone marrow is extracted from the hipbone or breastbone. Risks
include pain, complications from anesthesia, infection and the
possible need for a blood transfusion.

<TEXT>
   America's No. 1 video chain is
swallowing No. 3 in a $40 million deal that gives Blockbuster
Entertainment Corp. a total of more than 1,700 stores.
   Blockbuster agreed to acquire Erol's Inc. of Springfield, Va., a
chain of 208 outlets that pioneered the video rental business in
1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiff
competition.
   The deal ``provides an outstanding opportunity for Blockbuster
and its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores,''
Blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer H. Wayne Huizenga
said Monday.
   Erol's, the nation's third-largest chain behind West
Coast-National of Philadelphia, has stores in Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Cleveland and Chicago as well as 112 stores in the
Washington, D.C., area, where Blockbuster has only 48 outlets and
was looking to expand.
   Blockbuster, based in Fort Lauderdale, opened its 1,500th store
Monday, in Vancouver, British Columbia. In all, the chain has
stores in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico,
Canada and England.
   Erol's founder and principal stockholder, Erol Onaran, said the
buyout was in the best interest of his 2,600 employees.
   ``It was going to be a fight,'' said analyst Drew Beja at Advest
Securities. ``And Blockbuster had the resources to win the fight.''
   Onaron founded Erol's as a stereo repair shop in Washington in
1963. It was an early pioneer in the video industry, opening stores
exclusively devoted to rentals in 1980, and led all other video
chains in revenue until Blockbuster surpassed it in 1988.
   But Erol's has been stagnating since then, and didn't begin to
sell franchises until last August, said Frank Molstad, editor of
Video Store magazine.
   In contrast, Blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 stores
a year since Huizenga bought the company in 1987 for $19 million,
and Huizenga has said sales this year could top $1 billion.
   Erol's had revenue of $100 million last year, said Jerry
Falkner, an analyst at Southwest Research Partners in Boca Raton.
   While more than 1,700 stores by the end of the year, Blockbuster
will still have only about 10 percent of the home video market,
said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.

<HEAD>Government, University Scientists Develop Superconducting
Transistor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EGGLESTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say they see exciting potential
for the world's first high-temperature superconducting transistor
in the development more advanced supercomputers, microwave
components and other electronics.
   The new transistor was developed at the University of Wisconsin
and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and operates
at a relatively high temperature of minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit,
the scientists said Monday.
   While superconductive compounds that function at similarly high
temperatures have been known for years, the transistor marks the
first successful attempt to use such materials to create a
transistor.
   The Department of Energy also backed the project, which now has
advanced to the installation of the transistor into a functioning
electronic circuit.
   Transistors, often the size of pinheads, function in
supercomputers and other electronic devices as the switches that
control current. They also are used to amplify signals from devices
ranging from stereos to satellites.
   Superconductivity, the loss of all resistance to electrical
current, occurs in dozens of materials when they are chilled to
minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit, or close to absolute zero.
   Devices that become superconductive at higher, more easily
achievable temperatures would allow more practical applications and
could open the way to faster supercomputers, microwave components
and other electronics products.
   The new transistor is etched in a thin film of thalium and
superconducting copper oxide and is chilled to the temperature of
liquid nitrogen.
   While you still ``can't keep it in your shirt pocket,'' it gives
scientists more flexibility because it operates at a higher
temperature, said electrical engineering Professor James B. Beyer,
who directed the project along with Professor James E. Nordman and
university graduate Jon Martens.
   The new transistor intrigues scientists partly because it
functions far differently from conventional transistors.
   Conventional transistors use alteration in the voltage to
control current. The new transistor uses changes in the current to
control voltage.
   Ken Frazier, a Sandia spokeesman, said the new transistor may
serve as a bridge between circuitry that functions at room
temperature and circuitry being developed using superconductivity
close to absolute zero.
   But Nordman cautioned that scientists are still studying the new
transistor and are far fro determining its applications.
   ``The transistor was invented in 1948, and we've been learning
about it ever since,'' he said.

<HEAD>Vietnam Repatriates 11 Sets Of Possible American Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team flew to Hanoi
today to receive 11 sets of remains that the Vietnamese say may be
those of missing American soldiers, a U.S. official said.
   After a repatriation ceremony at Hanoi's airport, the remains
were to be flown to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in
Hawaii for analysis, said James Williams, spokesman for the U.S.
Embassy in Bangkok.
   He said Vietnam last returned remains on Sept. 13, when 20 sets
were handed over. None of those have yet been identified.
   The Pentagon lists 2,294 Americans as missing in action, or MIA,
from the Vietnam War, which ended in the Communist defeat of the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April 1975. Of these, 1,676
are missing in Vietnam, 529 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in
Chinese coastal waters.
   In August 1987, U.S. presidential envoy John W. Vessey and
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach agreed to new forms of
cooperation.
  Since then, Vietnam has returned a total of 101 remains in 15
repatriations.
   Williams said that since 1974, more than 400 sets of remains
have been returned from Vietnam, but only 245 Americans have been
accounted for as a result.
   Most of the remains, he said, were determined to be those of
Southeast Asian Mongoloids although a few sets are still under
analysis.
   U.S. and Vietnamese experts held talks on accelerating
cooperation on the MIA issue on Nov. 7-9 in Hanoi.
   The Vietnam News Agency said they discussed plans to conduct
their 12th and 13th joint searches in coming months. In these
searches, investigators inspect plane crash sites, interview
villagers who witnessed crashes and collect other evidence of
missing soldiers.
   Late last month, Thach said he welcomed the idea of the United
States stationing an official in Hanoi to coordinate efforts to
account for missing Americans.
   The two countries do not have diplomatic relations and the
United States has not posted an official in Vietnam since the war.
U.S. officials in Bangkok said, however, that it did not appear an
official would be posted there anytime soon.

   The chairman of Minnesota's second-largest
bank was abducted at gunpoint and forced to make a ransom demand
from his car phone but escaped uninjured after being left alone in
the woods, authorities said.
   The search continued today for the lone gunman and the banker's
Mercedes.
   First Bank System Chairman John Grundhofer was kidnapped Monday
when he arrived at his office building. He escaped two hours later
and called for help from a dairy farm in Wisconsin, just over the
Minnesota line, authorities said.
   Jeff Jamar, chief of the FBI's Minneapolis office, said the
gunman approached Grundhofer in the bank's parking garage, forced
him back into the car and told him to drive out of the city.
   Authorities said Grundhofer called in a ransom demand to the
bank about an hour later. The amount was not disclosed. The ransom
was not paid.
   The kidnapper ``was prepared, well-planned. I believe he stalked
him, knew who he was after,'' Jamar said.
   Police Chief John Laux said a witness in the garage reported the
kidnapping. Authorities gave few details on the sequence of events
but said Grundhofer was left alone in the woods, freed himself and
walked to a farm.
   ``He wasn't released, he escaped,'' Jamar said. ``The person
left him (and) told him he'd be back.''
   KSTP-TV of St. Paul reported that Grundhofer was bound, placed
in a sleeping bag and left at the bottom of a wooded embankment in
Houlton, Wis.
   Bruce Dahlke, the farmer who let Grundhofer use the phone, told
the TV station he overhead the banker tell police the kidnapper
claimed to have attached explosives to Grundhofer's wrists. Police
would not confirm the account.
   ``I'm OK,'' Grundhofer said at a news conference Monday. ``I
have no idea why this took place this morning. ... We're very
grateful to the good Lord for me being here.''
   The abductor, described as between 50 and 60 years old, carried
a handgun and a knife and wore an overcoat, dark business suit, tie
and brown tweed hat, authorities said. He carried a black leather
satchel, investigators said.
   Grundhofer, 51, has been chairman, president and chief executive
officer since January of First Bank System Inc. With total assets
of $19.2 billion, it is the second-largest bank holding company in
Minnesota and the 36th largest in the nation.
   Previously he was vice chairman and senior executive officer for
Southern California at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank.
   He and his wife live in a western Minneapolis suburb, according
to a bank spokeswoman. They have two grown daughters who live in
California.
   Thirty years ago, while working at Union Bank in Los Angeles,
Grundhofer dodged a bullet while trying to repossess a debtor's
car, the Star Tribune reported today.
   In September, a gunman fired into a crowd at a bar in Berkeley,
Calif., killing one person and seriously wounding Grundhofer's
22-year-old daughter, Karen. Grundhofer said recently that his
daughter is recovering.

<HEAD>Ambassador Writes Open Letter To Pakistanis On U.S. Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador has written an
open letter to Pakistanis, explaining that $573 million in U.S. aid
has been suspended because Pakistan has not made adequate
assurances about its nuclear capability.
   The letter appeared in Monday's editions of the English-language
newspaper The Nation and several Urdu-language publications.
   Washington suspended military and economic assistance Oct. 1,
demanding greater assurances that Pakistan neither possesses nor
wants to possess nuclear weapons.
  Pakistan, the third-largest recepient of U.S. aid behind Egypt
and Israel, insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
The 2-week-old government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
pledged to go ahead with its nuclear program - even if it means
losing American aid.
   Many Pakistanis believe their country's nuclear program acts as
a deterrent against possible attack by India, its traditionally
hostile neighbor to the east. India exploded a nuclear device in
1974.
   The two uneasy neighbors went to war in 1948, 1965 and again in
1971. Fears of a fourth - and possibly nuclear - war escalated last
spring over the disputed territory of Kashmir, which is claimed by
both.
   In his letter, ambassador Robert Oakley tried to explain that
U.S. law prohibits economic and military aid to any country that
even possesses the components of a nuclear device.
   ``The definition of possession ... applies to components of a
nuclear device, not only to an assembled device,'' the letter says.
   Unless the U.S. president provides certification to Congress,
assistance is suspended on Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal
year, Oakley said.
   ``There is no authority for any action by the president to
extend this date, which only Congress can do if the president fails
to certify,'' he said.
   The ambassador said President Bush had proposed that Congress
delay the suspension so that U.S. aid would not be an issue in the
Oct. 24 parliamentary election.
   The right-wing political parties blamed ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto for the suspension and used the issue not only to
defeat her at the polls but to fuel anti-American sentiment.
   ``I know there is a widespread tendency in Pakistan to see the
United States as a huge spider spinning its web and determining
what happens in all corners of the world, but you should not fall
into this trap,'' Oakley said.
   ``Nor should you assume that better relations between Pakistan
and India, or a mutual reduction in armaments, would necessarily be
at Pakistani exepense,'' he said.
   ``A lowering of both the threat level between Pakistan and India
and the amount of money they spend for defense would seem to be a
good thing for the peoples of both country.
   ``Why not explore it seriously rather than suspect that
Pakistan's favorite arch-villain, the United States, is plotting to
weaken and undermine you with such a subversive, insidious
suggestion?'' he said.

<HEAD>Eight Teen-agers Arraigned in Wilding Attack That Left Woman Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE STUART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight teen-agers have been charged with raping and
murdering a young mother in a ``wilding'' attack that police said
rivals New York's Central Park jogger case in savagery.
   The eight were arraigned Monday in the slaying of Kimberly Rae
Harbour, 26, who was beaten with a branch and a broken bottle,
repeatedly raped, stabbed and kicked. Her body was found in a field
near the housing project where she lived.
   ``One person jumped on top of her repeatedly,'' Detective Peter
J. O'Malley said during the arraignment.
   Police said the Boston youths went out as a group on Halloween
night looking for women to rob. They bragged about the crime the
next day, news reports said.
   Harbour's father, Russell, said he was at a loss to understand
the attack on his daughter, who had a 7-year-old daughter of her
own and had recently worked for the Census Bureau. The girl now
lives with relatives in Virginia.
   ``An animal wouldn't do this,'' he said. ``I'm not a vengeful
person, but I would like to push the button, pull the rope, cut
them up myself.''
   Lt. Detective Edward McNelley, head of the homicide squad, said
the case shares similarities with the New York case, in which a
gang of youths jumped, raped and beat a 28-year-old investment
banker jogging in Central Park.
   The jogger survived despite losing much of her blood. Three
people were convicted, two are on trial and one awaits trial. The
case gave wide exposure to the term ``wilding'' for gang attacks
carried out for fun against passersby.
   Carlos Garcia and Corey James, both 18, and Che Barnes, 17, all
of Boston's Dorchester section, were jailed without bail on charges
of aggravated rape, murder and armed robbery.
   Five juveniles ages 14 to 16 were arraigned in the attack as
well and placed in juvenile custody. Their names were withheld.
   ``I haven't seen anything this bad in 15 years,'' said court
probation officer Billy Stewart. ``You're talking major-league
wilding here. You're talking animal here, pure vicious.''

   An increasing number of Americans believe
President Bush is moving too fast toward military action in the
Persian Gulf, according to a New York Times-CBS poll.
   Forty-seven percent of those polled said the Bush administration
has been too quick to get U.S. forces involved and has not been
diligent enough about seeking diplomatic solutions, according to
the poll in today's Times.
   Only 38 percent felt that way back in August.
   Just over half - 51 percent - of those polled expect the United
States to fight Iraq.
   Less than a third ofthose polled - 31 percent - felt that
protecting the oil supply was a good enough reason to go to war.
   Slightly more - 35 percent - felt U.S. military action against
Iraq would be justified to defend Saudi Arabia and restore the
Kuwaiti government.
   More than half - 54 percent - said that stopping Saddam Hussein
from developing nuclear weapons was a good enough reason to wage
war.
   Shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, 75 percent of
Americans approved of Bush's decision to send American soldiers to
the Middle East and gather international support for an embargo
against Iraq.
   Only 50 percent now approve of Bush's approach, while 41 percent
disapprove.
   Sixty-one percent of those surveyed said the United States was
right to send troops to Saudi Arabia initially. Only 41 percent
support sending more than 150,000 additional troops.
   The poll of 1,370 adults was done by telephone Nov. 13-15. It
has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage
points.

   Snow covered higher elevations in the West today, while mild,
dry weather prevailed over much of the rest of the nation.
   Lower elevations in the Northwest and in Northern California got
scattered rain, and the mountains of Maine had clouds and flurries.
   A storm over the Bering Strait brought snow and high winds to
western Alaska.
   Dry weather prevailed over most of the nation, with fair skies
in the south-central and southeastern United States and mostly mild
weather in the Midwest.
   The forecast called for continued heavy snow in the mountains of
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada and
Arizona. Sattered showers were expected tonight in Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 88 degrees at
McCallen, Texas.
   Elsewhere in Texas, Amarillo and El Paso reached 79 degrees,
tying records in those cities for the date.

   President Saddam Hussein said today that he
would ask the National Assembly to meet later in the day and grant
all German hostages freedom, state-run Baghdad radio reported.
   Iraqi officials said passage was certain.
   Saddam said the Germans should go free because of what he called
the history of excellent ties between Germany and the Arab world.
   There was no indication of when the releases would take place.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has expressed a reluctance to
exercise the military option against Iraq.
   On Sunday, he urged President Bush to exhaust all other possible
options before resorting to military force to try to drive Iraqi
forces from Kuwait.
   Earlier this week, Iraq said all foreigners would be set free
between Christmas and March 25, but Information Minister Latif
Nassiyif Jassim indicated Monday that some might be allowed to
leave earlier.
   However, he also indicated that passage of a U.N. resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraq might hinder the
releases.
   There are about 280 Germans left in Iraq and Kuwait, with some
held at strategic sites in an effort to ward off an attack by the
U.S.-led multinational forces seeking to force Iraq out of Kuwait.

   Riot police swinging steel-tipped
batons today dispersed about 200 rock-hurling protesters who were
enforcing a general strike to demand the ouster of President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   The 24-hour nationwide strike apparently was successful in the
capital, where businesses shut and streets were deserted. Buses and
bicycle rickshaws also stayed off the roads.
   At least 20 people were injured in the clash with the police in
downtown Dhaka. Some of the victims were hit on the head with rifle
butts.
   In another part of the city, 15 studets were injured when they
were attacked by supporters of Ershad with sticks and knives,
United News of Bangladesh said.
   The news agency said the students were opposition activists and
were forcing shops and offices to close in central Dhaka.
   Government offices were open but few people attended. Most
workers walked to work and ministers drove to their offices before
the strike began at 6 a.m. Opposition parties led by the Awami
League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party intensified their
anti-Ershad campaign Oct. 10, calling a series of strikes and
demonstrations that often turned violent.
   At least eight protesters have been fatally shot by police
since.
   Today's shutdown was the seventh in a month called by the
opposition, which wants Ershad to resign before the national
elections scheduled next year. Ershad has refused.
   On Monday, at least 200 people were injured in 13 towns across
the country during clashes between police and supporters and
opponents of Ershad.
   About 100 people were injured when pro- and anti-Ershad groups
fought with crude bombs and rocks in Rajshahi, 120 miles north of
Dhaka, United News Of Bangladesh said.
   In the southern port city of Chittagong, police fired bullets
and tear gas to quell anti-government demonstrators, leaving at
least 40 people injured.
   Bengali-language newspaper Sangbad said another 60 people were
injured in clashes in 11 other towns.
   The 60-year-old president seized power in a bloodless coup in
1982. He quit the army after winning presidential elections in 1986
that observers said were heavily rigged.
   Ershad has promised to hold another presidential election in
1991, but the opposition has vowed to boycott it, saying the polls
are certain to be rigged again.
   They demand that Ershad resign and hand over power to a
caretaker government until the elections decide the new leadership.
   Opposition leaders also have rejected Ershad's assurance that
the 1991 elections will not be rigged and that he will invite
foreign observers, including former President Jimmy Carter, to
monitor the polls.

   Police blame guns and drugs for a deadly
onslaught they say has brought more homicides to Oakland this year
than ever before.
   The fatal shootings of two late Sunday in an area known for drug
activity brought the number of killings for the first 10{ months of
1990 to 149, police said. During all of last year, a record 148
people were killed.
   Police Lt. Mike Sims said drugs were involved in about 30
percent of the city's slayings and guns were used in about 75
percent.
   He said he doesn't see the city of 350,000 reducing its homicide
rate until ``the overall cause of drugs and violence are
surpressed.''
   Three of the weekend's five killings appeared drug-related,
police said, and one involved a 15-year-old who was killed when two
other teen-agers fired into a crowd with shotguns.

   Burma's military rulers have sentenced
two opposition leaders to 10-year jail terms in the toughest move
yet against the party that won national elections in May, a
political source said today.
   A military tribunal sentenced Kyi Maung and Chit Khaing of the
National League for Democracy on Monday, said the source, who was
contacted in Rangoon from Bangkok and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   At the time of his arrest, Kyi Maung, 72, was acting leader of
the league, which won the May 27 elections by a landslide but has
been barred from taking office by the military government. Most of
the rest of the party's leadership also is behind bars.
   Both men were arrested on Sept. 6. It appeared they were
sentenced under the terms of Burma's Official Secrets Act, the
source said.
   Violation of the act carries a maximum prison term of 14 years,
the source said.
   Western diplomats said at the time of the arrests that the men
apparently were accused of passing to other league members a
confidential document given to them by the chief of military
intelligence, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt.
   Kyi Maung and Chit Khaing were among the 392 members of the
National League for Democracy who won parliamentary seats in the
election. Both were members of the central executive committee.
   Political sources in Rangoon report that authorities have
arrested at least 50 other members of the party, including about 15
elected members of parliament, since the end of October.
   Only four of the league's 10-person central executive committee
remain free.
   On Nov. 9, a leading organizer of the party, Maung Ko, died in
military custody, and political sources said relatives believed he
was tortured to death. The head of the military government, Gen.
Saw Maung, said Maung Ko had committed suicide.
   The general secretary of the party, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been
under house arrest since July 1989. Its chairman, Tin Oo, was
sentenced in December to three years in prison, with hard labor.
   Saw Maung's government came to power in September 1988, when
troops killed thousands of people to crush a nationwide
pro-democracy uprising.
   His latest clampdown has included raids on Buddhist monasteries
and the arrest of at least 200 dissident monks, political sources
have said.
   Kyi Maung, a retired army colonel, was considered a moderate
with the potential to mediate between the military and more radical
elements of his own party.
   Chit Khaing, 69, headed the league's publications wing.
   Saw Maung indicated in a speech on Nov. 13 that Kyi Maung's
arrest may have been related to an interview he gave to the Hong
Kong-based magazine Asiaweek following the election.
   In the interview, Kyi Maung expressed his views on whether
military officers would be tried by a future opposition-led
government for ordering the killings of demonstrators.
   Kyi Maung said there would be no witch hunt, but added that Khin
Nyunt might reasonably feel insecure about the possibility.
   On July 13, Khin Nyunt called the statement insulting and said
he could sue Kyi Maung.

   A relief group has a special Christmas
gift for the Soviet Union - 220,000 pounds of food and medicine.
   AmeriCares, which normally sends such supplies to countries that
have just been stricken by natural disasters, is making this
shipment in the hope of avoiding a disastrous food shortage next
year.
   ``Our people (in the Soviet Union) said ... this was going to be
a bleak winter,'' AmeriCares spokesman Steve Norman said Monday.
``Our whole idea is, hopefully, to avert any severe shortages.''
   The Soviet Union is facing a shortage of potatoes and other
crops that rotted before they could be delivered to market. In
Leningrad, officials voted last week to begin wide-scale food
rationing Dec. 1.
   The first of three AmeriCares airlifts is scheduled to arrive in
Moscow on Dec. 13 carrying supplies destined for 24 orphanges. The
other shipments are to arrive around Christmas and will go to
hospitals and social service agencies. Volunteer doctors will also
arrive in Moscow at that time.
   The Christmas shipments continue a relationship AmeriCares began
with the Soviet Union following the country's devastating Armenian
earthquake of 1988. ``We're hoping that this might be an
encouragement for other groups to do the same thing,'' Norman said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall said today
he hopes the Warsaw Pact can be dissolved by 1992.
   ``New democracies in middle and eastern Europe are now standing
before the task of a new formulation of their relations and of
their security policies,'' Antall told the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
   ``We hope that the conditions for the complete dissolution of
the Warsaw Pact within the European security process will be
created by early 1992,'' he said. ``We are happy that the
participating states of the (Warsaw Pact) have shown agreement over
the dissolution of the military organization.''
   The Warsaw Pact was founded in 1955.
   Antall is the first Warsaw Pact country leader to talk about the
complete demise of the pact and to propose a deadline. In the past,
the leaders have spoken only of ending the Warsaw Pact's military
function.
   However, the future of the pact has been one of major subjects
of the three-day meeting on the post-Cold War restructuring of
Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said Monday that the six
remaining members of the Warsaw Pact ``are likely to take important
decisions before the end of the year on transforming the
organization and changing its character.'' He did not provide
details.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel called the Warsaw Pact ``a
remnant of the past.''
   ``It came into being as a typical product of Stalinist
expansionism,'' Havel said.

<TEXT>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has
filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against a Baltimore TV station
accused of firing an anchorwoman because she demanded the same pay
as her male counterparts.
   Officials said the lawsuit Monday against WBAL and parent
company Hearst Corp. is the first such action by the federal agency
against a TV station.
   EEOC Chairman Evan Kemp Jr. said the agency found that former
anchorwoman Ruth Ann ``Rudy'' Miller was paid less than her male
counterparts for similar duties and fired in 1989 because she
demanded equal pay.
   Miller earned $141,000 a year when she was fired, compared to
$170,000 and $180,000 for two male anchormen, the EEOC said.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court, also claims Miller was
given different assignments and faced increased scrutiny of her
clothes and hairstyle because she is a woman. The lawsuit seeks
back wages and an equal amount in damages.
   Miller filed her own lawsuit in January alleging similar
violations. She demanded $200,000 in damages.
   ``It is ironic and disturbing that an organization devoted to
protecting the public's interest paid so little attention to
illegal discriminatory activities within its own ranks,'' Kemp
said.
   The lawsuit should ``send a message throughout the country'' to
TV stations, he said.
   David Barrett, station vice president and general manager,
denied the allegations. He said Miller earned less because she
refused to anchor the 11 p.m. newscast. She had been anchoring the
noon and 5 p.m. newscasts when her contract was not renewed.
   Miller, 41, is now host of a daily radio talk show in Baltimore
and publishes the monthly Maryland Family Magazine. She said if the
lawsuit ``helps other women, God, that's great.''
   Gerald Kiel, EEOC regional attorney, said the commission sued
after negotiations to reach a settlement failed.

<TEXT>
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to the
world's affluent nations to help Eastern Europe's transition to
democracy so that it doesn't collapse from economic hardships and
social unrest.
   With the end of the Cold War divisions, ``there must now be no
borders which perpetuate the prosperity divide,'' Kohl told the 34
leaders of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   The newly united Germany is placing aid to the Soviet Union high
on its agenda of shaping the post-Cold War world order. Germany is
coordinating emergency international food deliveries to help the
Soviets overcome severe shortages and alleviate the winter cold.
   President Bush said Monday he would be willing to send food,
too.
   Unlike his American, Soviet and British counterparts, Kohl in
his speech avoided direct mention of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   He expressed worry about growing nationalism in parts of Eastern
Europe, and the plight of ethnic minorities. ``Outmoded hostile
stereotyping from the days of (Cold War) confrontation must not be
replaced by backward-looking nationalism,''said Kohl.
   Kohl also formally pledged that the reunited Germany will only
use its global muscle for the pursuit of peace, and won't repeat
mistakes of the past.
   ``Peace alone will emanate from German soil,'' said Kohl.
   German experts will be sent to the Soviet Union next week to
examine needs, Kohl told reporters Monday night.
   Kohl said he spoke with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
about the proposed aid. President Bush also said Monday that the
United States is willing to send emergency food supplies to the
Soviet Union, and Kohl said the plan is supported by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``We'll talk about this in the EC (European Community) very
soon,'' said Kohl, adding that EC leaders have already told him
they are ready to help out.
   He said some supplies could be shipped by train as early as next
week.
   Kohl and Gorbachev have been steering their countries closer
together in the past few months. The chancellor wants to help
Gorbachev keep the Soviet Union from collapsing, at least partly
because of the economic shock waves it could send into Europe.
   Kohl said he impressed on Gorbachev the importance of making
sure food shipments from the West are not backed up at the border
by the Soviet Union's slow-moving bureaucracy.
   Kohl is making his debut as leader of the united Germany at the
summit. Before the Oct. 3 unification, Kohl's West Germany already
was Europe's mightiest economic machine, and German economic power
is expected to expand even further in the next few years.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Down 6 Percent in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing starts plummeted 6.0 percent in
October to their lowest level since the last recession, the
government said today. And as a portent of things to come, building
permit applications plunged to their lowest level since the 1981-82
downturn.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.04 million units
following declines of 2.1 percent in September and 1.9 percent in
August.
   Housing starts through October have declined for nine straight
months, the first time that has occurred since the department began
keeping records in 1959.
   And the number of October starts was the lowest since 902,000
units got under way in June 1982.
   The housing industry has been in a slump for more than a year,
with starts during the first 10 months of 1990 down 12.4 percent
from the same period of 1989.
   The department also said applications for building permits,
often a barometer of future activity, fell 6.8 percent to 925,000.
It was the lowest level since 913,000 applications were filed in
June 1982.
   ``Tighter credit conditions and plummeting demand continue to
take their toll on the residential housing industry,'' economists
with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York wrote in their Weekly Economic
Indicator Report.
   The weakness resulted in the loss of 80,000 construction jobs in
October, the Labor Department reported earlier. Over the past five
months, the industry has seen jobs tumble by 185,000.
   Analysts see no immediate improvement.
   ``We look for further deterioration through year-end, although
the pace of decline could moderate,'' economists with Fuji
Securities Inc. in Chicago wrote in their weekly Perspectives.
   ``No upturn is expected until next spring at the earliest,''
said Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington.
   Construction of single-family units dropped 1.0 percent to
854,000 units following a 3.2 percent increase the previous month.
   Multi-family starts plunged 23.3 percent to 187,000 units after
a 17.3 percent drop in September.
   The Northeast, which has seen some of the slowest housing
activity recently, posted the only gain in starts - up 38.5 percent
to 144,000 units.
   Starts were down 16.9 percent to 266,000 units in the West, and
10.4 percent to 395,000 units in the South. Starts were off 2.5
percent to 236,000 in the Midwest.

   Some 200 people gathered for a candlelight
vigil to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the execution of labor
leader Joe Hill.
   Hill, a songwriter, poet and union organizer whose tunes
condemned capitalist bosses and promoted workers' rights and union
solidarity, was executed by a firing squad in Utah on Nov. 19,
1915.
   He was convicted of two slayings, but supporters believed he was
a victim of the anti-labor sentiment that flared after bitter
strikes in Utah's copper mines.
   ``Joe Hill was larger than life, even when he was alive, because
he reached into the heart, soul and psyche of the people,'' Steve
Banick, Amnesty International, said at the ceremony Monday night.
``He promoted workers' rights and human rights.''
   Rosalie Sorrels sang several labor-organizing ballads including
``I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night'' and ``The Rebel Girl.''
   After the program the crowd carried candles to the spot in
Sugarhouse Park where the state prison once stood and Hill was put
to death.

<HEAD>Socialists Prepare to Settle Scores After Censure Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Socialists pledged today to settle
scores with their former Communist allies after Prime Minister
Michel Rocard squeaked through a no-confidence vote in parliament.
   The Communists, normally allied with the Socialists in the
National Assembly, defected Monday and voted with three opposition
conservative parties in favor of the no-confidence motion.
   But the coalition fell five ballots short of the absolute
majority of 289 needed in the 577-seat assembly.
   Socialist Party First Secretary Pierre Mauroy, in a radio
interview today, pledged revenge on the Communists.
   ``We're going to go to all the city halls controlled by the left
to say to the Communists, `We had agreements, you didn't keep them,
you mixed your votes with those of the right,'' said Mauroy, a
former prime minister.
   The vote came while France hosted the 34-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   The no-confidence vote was the most serious challenge to
Rocard's leadership since the Socialists returned to power in 1988.
   The main conservative parties - the Rally for the Republic,
Union for French Democracy and Union of the Center - filed the
no-confidence motion over a social security tax proposed by Rocard.
   The Socialists normally rely on the Communists to abstain from
such votes, allowing the government a comfortable margin of
security.
   But the Communists pledged this time to vote with the right,
bringing a combined potential of 286 votes behind the measure. The
coalition needed just three independent deputies to win.
   The Socialists, who have only 272 seats, managed to get support
from some independent deputies and some stray conservatives and
Communists, leaving the opposition five votes short.
   Conservative leader Charles Millon predicted that a wave of
troubles besieging the government would continue, including
demonstrations by high school students demanding better education.
Their protests occasionally have turned into riots.
   Other troubles include a slowing economy, a campaign
fund-raising scandal implicating Justice Minister Henri Nallet and
rioting by youths in suburban ghettos outside Paris and Lyon.
   Rocard had no comment after the vote except to thank the
parliamentarians for their support.
   The effort to oust Rocard was prompted by a dispute over his
proposal for a 1.1 percent social security tax. It would replace
part of the existing social security fund, which is subsidized by
employers and employees.
   The Communists and conservatives opposed the plan, saying it
would levy taxes on some previously exempt retired and unemployed
people. They also say the tax could be raised in coming years.
   Rocard says the tax would streamline the social security system
and reduce the tax burden on most poor and middle-income people.

<HEAD>Report Says Briton Went Missing Six Months Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper Ad-Diyar published a letter
today from friends of a British national saying he disappeared in
Lebanon seven months ago and they feared he was kidnapped.
   The Arabic-language letter, signed by ``Friends of British
businessman Robin Gregson,'' said his disappearance was reported to
the British Embassy three months ago but was ignored.
   ``Our friend Robin Gregson went missing more than six months ago
between the town of Chekka and the port of Jounieh. He was heading
for Jounieh to leave via its port on April 21,'' the letter said.
   Chekka is a coastal town in Syrian-policed north Lebanon and
Jounieh is the main port in the Christian enclave. A passenger boat
line serves the Christian enclave with daily trips from Jounieh to
Larnaca, Cyprus.
   ``We have inquired about his whereabouts with the Lebanese and
Cypriot immigration authorities as well as with a number of
political parties in north Lebanon, but to no avail,'' the letter
said.
   ``The British Embassy was informed of the matter three months
ago, but unfortunately it did not show any interest in the
disappearance of one of its citizens,'' the report added.
   Police said they have no record on Gregson and telephone calls
to the British Embassy in Beirut's northern suburb of Jal el-Deeb
were not answered.
   The letter suggested that Gregson was kidnapped.
   ``To his kidnappers we say: Release Robin so he could return to
his family and friends. More than seven years ago he chose to live
in Lebanon because he loved Lebanon despite all that has
happened,'' the letter concluded.
   The letter did not indicate where the friends lived.
   Because his disappearance remains unconfirmed, Gregson was not
listed among the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon, most believed
kidnapped by pro-Iranian underground factions. The hostages include
six Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.

   Mayor Dana Rinehart launched a citywide
honesty campaign last year that drew national attention, but now
he's admitted that he lied about having an extramarital affair.
   ``You find somebody whose life is perfect, and let him lead the
campaign. My life is not perfect,'' Rinehart said Monday in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   Until last weekend, Rinehart called reports of his affair with
Human Services Director Brenda Dodrill an ``outhouse rumor.''
   But in an interview Saturday with a radio station, the
44-year-old mayor acknowledged the affair.
   ``I flat wasn't telling the truth,'' Rinehart told WTVN-AM.
   ``I'm not proud of what's happened, but I'm not unhappy about
it,'' Ms. Dodrill said in a newspaper interview published today.
``As far as a personal relationship, we'll have to see what
happens. We don't have any plans.''
   She said her involvement with Rinehart was a private matter,
adding, ``I'm not an elected public official.''
   Rinehart said Monday he lied to protect innocent people.
   ``It was not truthful. I'm sorry about that. ... I felt that my
willingness to take that risk, knowing full well that someday I
would have this conversation with a reporter - I would pay for
this. I was trying to protect them,'' he said.
   Rinehart and his wife, Carol, have two children.
   Rinehart, a Republican in his second four-year term, announced
July 22 that he would not seek another term, saying family,
financial and political reasons influenced his decision.
   The following month, he and his wife announced they had
separated.
   Now he says he will not resign and will decide in December
whether to seek re-election in 1991.
   Rinehart was at the forefront of a 1989 campaign called ``Take
an Honest Look.'' He established the Columbus Commission on Ethics
and Values after an incident in which the rear doors of an armored
car flew open, spilling thousands of dollars onto a downtown
highway.
   Motorists grabbed the cash and most of them kept it.
   Newspaper advertisements and broadcast commercials urged
residents to ``examine honesty as it affects our daily lives.''
   A former Watergate conspirator, the Rev. Jeb Stuart Magruder,
was chairman of the commission. He has since moved from Columbus to
Lexington, Ky., to become minister of the First Presbyterian
Church.
   Like Magruder, many members of the commission, which included
City Council members and religious, business and education leaders,
declined to comment about the matter.
   But John S. Christie, who served on the commission during the
campaign, said he didn't think the affair would hinder Rinehart's
effectiveness as mayor.
   ``I have always found the mayor, as an administrator on city
business, to be a very good mayor,'' said Christie, vice president
for corporate development at Battelle Memorial Research Institute.
``Even though there are personal problems, I still think he has the
ability and the wherewithal to keep high standards as it relates to
running the business of the city of Columbus.''
   Rinehart, 44, said he would continue to serve on the commission.
   Ms. Dodrill, 32, began working at City Hall in 1986 as a
$28,205-a-year personnel specialist. She was appointed to her post
last year and makes $66,685 a year.
   Ms. Dodrill's husband, Douglas Matteson, sued for divorce on
Oct. 30 and later filed court documents alleging an affair between
Rinehart and Ms. Dodrill.
   He alleged that Rinehart and Ms. Dodrill had been seeing each
other since March. They were together ``a couple times a week'' and
went out of town together for weekends at least twice, according to
the documents.
   Ms. Dodrill had not reported to work since the relationship was
revealed and is on vacation this week.
   It is not the first sex-related controversy involving Rinehart.
In 1978, when Rinehart was Franklin County treasurer, family baby
sitter Vicki Rae Pardue accused him of sexually assaulting her.
   Ms. Pardue alleged that, while napping at Rinehart's home after
baby sitting his children, she awoke to find him performing oral
sex on her.
   Rinehart denied the allegations. A county grand jury
investigated but did not issue an indictment.

<HEAD>Army, Marines Call Up Additional 26,000 Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army and Marine Corps are ordering to
active duty 26,625 additional reservists, many for combat roles, as
the military reaches into hundreds of communities nationwide to
bolster its Persian Gulf deployments.
   The callups announced Monday were the largest on a single day
since President Bush authorized the use of citizen-soldiers in the
gulf crisis in August.
   It also was the Army's first call to arms for reserve combat
units, which some critics have said may not be adequately prepared
for desert warfare against Iraq.
   Since the start of Operation Desert Shield on Aug. 7, a total of
77,126 reservists have been called up - most in non-combat roles
such as transportation and cargo handling. It is the biggest
call-up of reservists since the Berlin crisis of 1961.
   The Army said Monday it ordered 20,129 National Guard and
Reserve members from 41 states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia to report for active duty Wednesday. The Army had put
those units on alert for possible call-up last Friday.
   The Pentagon initially said the Army units included three
National Guard combat brigades totaling about 12,000 troops - the
48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Georgia, the 155th Armored
Brigade of Mississippi and the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized)
of Louisiana. But today it said they were not included.
   Maj. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman, said he had misunderstood
the makeup of the Army units being activated, and that while they
included some combat reservists - such as the 1st Battalion, 158th
Field Artillery of the Oklahoma National Guard - they did not
include elements of the Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana
brigades.
   Elements of those three brigades were alerted last Friday that
they would be called up soon, but none has been officially ordered
to active duty, Hart said today.
   Each of those three brigades is a ``roundout'' unit for a
regular Army armored or mechanized division, but none was called up
in the initial deployment of more than 230,000 forces to the gulf.
It's still not certain that the three brigades will be sent to the
front lines; they are scheduled to undergo desert warfare training
in the United States before a deployment decision is made.
   Reservists normally train one weekend per month plus one
two-week exercise a year.
   The Marine Corps said it was ordering 6,496 reservists to active
duty for Desert Shield. Most are expected to be deployed to the
gulf as part of Marine reinforcements totaling about 45,000 men.
About 45,000 regular Marines already are in the gulf area.
   The Marine reserves, from units in 23 states and the District of
Columbia, will report for duty starting Saturday with the 2nd
Marie Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, N.C. That unit is
expected to deploy to the gulf.
   The missions of the Marine reserves in the latest call-up
include air defense, mechanized and infantry operations, close air
support, radar and artillery.
   Bush has authorized a maximum call-up of 125,000 reserves from
all services. The reserve forces total more than 1.1 million men
and women.

<HEAD>Rebels Launch Nationwide Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas today
attacked military positions in eastern and central El Salvador in
what they said was a nationwide campaign. At least 10 people were
killed, according to preliminary reports.
   The victims were mostly rebel or government combatants, the
reports said.
   The rebels, in a communique, said the attacks on a dozen
military positions did not constitute a major offensive, but rather
``a nationwide military campaign.''
   The guerrilla communique said the campaign was dubbed
``Punishment of the Armed Forces.''
   The most concentrated and sustained attacks appeared to be on
garrisons and army positions in the eastern cities of San Francisco
Gotera and Usulutan.
   Residents of the those towns said the attacks began about 3 a.m.
(4 a.m. EST) and that sporadic fighting continued until after dawn.
   Local radio stations with correspondents in the provinces, as
well as the Armed Forces Press Committee, also reported attacks on
army posts in the towns of San Jose Guayabal, Suchitoto, Nejapa,
Apopa and Quetzaletpeque.
   All five towns are in a radius of 15 miles north of San
Salvador.
   Preliminary reports indicated four soldiers killed and 20
wounded in the fighting. Six rebels were killed and four wounded,
according to the same reports.
   The guerrilla high command threatened to escalate the level of
fighting if the government and the military refused to negotiate
sweeping reforms in the armed forces.
   It said there could be cease-fire only when the armed forces
impunity in human rights cases ends.
   The campaign comes only days after the anniversary of the army
massacre of six Jesuit priests on Nov. 16, 1989. The priests were
slain amid a bloody rebel offensive in the capital.
   Thousands of leftists, suspected leftists, human rights
activists, intellectuals, labor activists and government opponents
have died at the hands of the military or military-linked death
squads during the decade-long civil war.
   In all, more than 72,000 people, mainly civilians, have been
killed.

<TEXT>
   An Air Force sergeant's 3{-year-old son
has unwittingly come up with a new nickname for Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, a moniker that has the White House laughing.
   It took Pam Averill a minute to figure out what her son, Kyle,
meant when he said, ``Sadly Insane took Daddy away.''
   Kyle's father, Sgt. Kenneth Averill, was shipped from Loring Air
Force Base in Limestone, Maine, to an island off the coast of Saudi
Arabia on Aug. 20, 18 days after Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait.
   ``He has heard us talking and it's hard for a little kid to say
`Saddam Hussein,' '' said Averill, who moved from the air base to
live with her parents while her husband is away. ``It's even hard
for me to say it.''
   Kyle's grandmother, Joyce Austin, wrote President Bush to let
him in on the joke. A typed reply from the White House carried the
handwritten note at the end: ``Sadly Insane? I love it.''
   Apparently, someone in Washington thinks it's funny enough to
spread around, Averill said.
   ``Someone from the White House called to tell us the president
might use the phrase in a speech,'' she said. ``They didn't want to
get our hopes up, but wanted to let us know it might happen.''

   The National Assembly has declared a
government monopoly on the trading of wheat, barley, rice, corn and
other cereals and mandated the death penalty for anyone violating
the law, the state press said today.
   The 250-member parliament passed the law late Monday, saying it
was necessary because of shortages caused by the U.N. embargo.
   The assembly said the law was needed to deter greed.
   The law bans sales of grains for trading by both private sector
middlemen and farmers. The government will have a monopoly on both
sales and storage.
   Farmers will be allowed to keep 1,000 pounds of wheat for their
personal use and 400 pounds of rice, but the rest must be turned
over to the goverment within two weeks of harvest.
   The annual rice harvest is just starting; the wheat harvest
usually begins in April.
   Before the invasion, Iraq imported 70 percent of its food. Iraq
has two rivers and abundant fertile land, but the government gave
agricultural development a much lower priority than industrial
growth.
   The U.N. embargo, imposed as part of efforts to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, cut off most imports.
   During the debate, some assembly members suggested that the
penalty be life in prison, but the majority voted for the death
penalty, the report said.
   The parliament is dominated by members of the ruling Arab Baath
Socialist Party and generally viewed as a rubber stamp for policy
initiated by the ruling command council under President Saddam
Hussein.

   Stanislaw Tyminski, a millionaire who
returned to his homeland after 21 years abroad to wage a strong
campaign for president, today rejected charges that he slandered
the government.
   Tyminski told reporters his statements are ``from the heart''
and he will not apologize.
   The justice minister on Monday announced a preliminary slander
investigation of Tyminski, a Polish-born businessman who recently
returned after making a fortune in Peru and Canada. The inquiry
stems from his statements to voters Nov. 17 in the southern resort
of Zakopane.
   Polls indicate Tyminski, who is backing his candidacy with his
personal wealth, is running a surprisingly strong third behind Lech
Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Tyminski today accused Mazowiecki of ``ignorance of the best
interests of the country in the economic sense.''
   Earlier, Tyminski accused the prime minister of ``betraying the
people.'' On a nationwide television broadcast Monday he tried to
back up the charge by showing documents purportedly proving the
government plans to sell state assets at greatly undervalued
prices.
   However, it turned out that Tyminski was mistaken - the figures
on the documents were not the selling prices for enterprises to be
privatized but summaries of sales turnover.
   Nonetheless, he said he did not intend to withdraw his
accusation, adding: ``I made the statement because I was right.''
   Tyminski says he is a self-made millionaire who left Poland at
21, spent several months in Sweden and then moved to Canada in 1970
to seek his fortune.
   He says he spent the early 1980s in an Amazon River port in
Peru, operating a cable television outfit and a restaurant, before
returning to Canada, where he runs Transduction Ltd., a computer
automation company outside Toronto. He says he is the leader of the
Libertarian Party of Canada.
   A poll by the state-owned polling service Friday showed Tyminski
was supported by 17 percent of those who intend to vote, behind
Mazowiecki with 19 percent and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa with
35 percent. A second poll Sunday produced similar results.
   A fresh face promising to apply his business wizardry to the
shattered economy, Tyminski seemed to appeal to disenchanted Poles
looking for an alternative to Walesa and Mazowiecki.
   While Tyminski had been written off by most media in Poland
until his latest surge in the polls, he is now the center of
attention.
   ``A Liar or a Fool'' was today's headline about Tyminski in the
nation's largest newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza.

<HEAD>US Military Chief Says Iraqi Reinforcement Plan May Backfire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's announced plan to send 250,000 more
troops to Kuwait is a publicity ploy and may hurt rather than help
the Iraqi army's war-fighting ability, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today.
   The state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Monday that President
Saddam Hussein had decided to form seven additional army divisions
and call up more than 150,000 reservists and regulars, ``adding to
our forces over a quarter of a million fighters.''
   Iraq already has about 430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern
Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates, facing off in the gulf area
against 230,000 American forces and at least 100,000 forces of U.S.
allies and other Arab nations.
   President Bush two weeks ago announced plans to send U.S.
reinforcements to the gulf that are expected to increase the
American force to about 430,000 by January.
   In an interview today with ``CBS This Morning,'' Powell said the
announced Iraq reinforcement plan didn't trouble U.S. military
planners, who are preparing for a possible order from Bush to
launch an offensive to liberate Kuwait.
   ``It's not clear that large numbers of additional, probably less
capable units significantly adds to his combat power in theatre;
and in fact, might present him with new vulnerabilities rather than
added strength,'' Powell said.
   The four-star general also said it is possible that Saddam is
planning to use the extra troops as replacements to allow weary
soldiers to rotate back from the front lines.
   ``He may be thinking of doing some rotations and some reliefs in
place,'' Powell said. ``We'll see. But at the moment, it's just
part of his headline-of-the-day program where he tries to divert
world opinion from his own aggression. Yesterday was a troop
buildup. The day before that, it was a hostage release. I think we
always have to keep coming back to the fundamental point that he is
trying to divert attention from his aggression, the fact that he
invaded a neighboring country, and now he is threatening peace in
the region.''

<HEAD>Activation of Guard Unit Shifts Homeless From Armory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150 homeless people who sought
shelter in a National Guard armory were evicted to make room for
200 guardsmen mobilizing for service in the Middle East.
   ``It's part of the craziness of these times,'' Philip Mangano,
executive director of the Greater Boston Adult Shelter Alliance,
said Monday. ``Operation Desert Shield takes precedence over the
sort of basic shield for people. It's a bizarre situation.''
   The homeless sheltered in the armory in the West Newton section
were moved about seven miles to an armory in Cambridge, guard
officials said.
   Mangano said such a move is traumatic for people who must now
get used to new surroundings.
   ``The time to warehouse people has passed, and nothing shows
that more than the events of this weekend, when we were forced to
deal with human beings as though they were less important than the
weapons being brought here,'' Mangano said.
   A dozen shelter workers spent Monday stacking cots, moving
office equipment, dismantling the health clinic and packing kitchen
supplies.
   About 200 members of the 972nd Military Police combat unit of
the Army National Guard are to be processed through the armory
before being activated.

<TEXT>
   More than 130 sticks of dynamite and
other explosives were found today in the capital's main oil storage
area one day after a bombing attack on the home of the country's
justice secretary.
   The incident was the latest sign of rising political tension in
Manila. On Monday, The Manila Times and The Manila Chronicle quoted
unidentified military sources as saying they expected right-wing
extremists to launch a new coup attempt next month.
   Police said the amount of explosives placed at the oil depot
could have set off a huge fire. The depot is in a densely populated
residential district of flimsy, frame houses.
   ``The ones who planted the bombs knew what they were doing,''
police Cpl. Edilberto Capacete said.
   Police said they did not know who planted the explosives, which
were booby-trapped to go off if disturbed.
   They said a janitor and a security guard found the explosives
near a group of six storage tanks at a Shell Oil Co. facility,
about a mile east of President Corazon Aquino's office.
   Facundo Roco, Shell company spokesman, said the bombs were
placed in four pipes leading to six fuel tanks. Each fuel tank had
a capacity of 50,000 liters, he said.
   Shell officials said the depot can store up to 7.9 million
gallons of fuel, but a spokesman refused to say how much oil was
actually stored there at the time.
   On Monday, four bombs hurled by unknown assailants exploded at
the home of Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon but he, his wife and
two children escaped injury.
   Drilon is responsible for prosecuting left-wing and right-wing
extremists opposed to President Corazon Aquino.
   Also today, the military said Communist rebels killed five
civilian militiamen and two soldiers in an ambush in a remote
village in the southern Philippines. There were no reports of
casualties on the rebel side in Monday's attack.
   The military said about 70 New People's Army guerrillas ambushed
a platoon of army soldiers and militiamen on patrol near the town
of Lapuyan, about 85 miles west of Iligan. Iligan is about 500
miles south of Manila.
   The rebels have been waging a 21-year-old insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.

<HEAD>Fire That Triggered Missiles Deliberately Set, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire that triggered the launch of two
anti-aircraft missiles in the Soviet Far East was deliberately set,
possibly by a discharged officer, a newspaper today quoted
investigators as saying.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth newspaper, said an
investigating committee determined an arsonist set fire to a bucket
of gasoline underneath one of the missiles' engines in the Nov. 15
incident, in the Amur region near the Chinese border. The committee
is headed by I.M. Tretyak, commander-in-chief of the air defense
troops.
   The fire set off the launching system and the missile struck and
destroyed a radar station, the newspaper said. The launch of the
first missile triggered a second missile, which hit a barracks
where servicemen were sleeping.
   The official Tass news agency reported last week that the second
missile killed one soldier and injured eight soldiers. Tass
reported safety devices on the missiles prevented their warheads
from exploding.
   ``A bucket full of gasoline was put under the solid propellant
engine of one missile, and set on fire,'' Komsomolskaya Pravda
said.
   ``But another missile was fired, too. There could have been many
more casualties.''
   The newspaper said investigators believe the fire may have been
set by a discharged officer, or may have been an act of revenge,
although it did not say by or against whom.
   ``Finally, the criminal could have been one of the draftees
called up last May and not willing to serve in the army,'' it said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said that three months before the incident,
a new commanding officer was assigned to the air defense unit,
which it said was ``lacking discipline and showing a low degree of
combat preparedness.''

about all the senators, I dare say. ...
   ``Now, Mr. Chairman, I regret that I have to mention and make
reference to Mr. Bennett (special counsel Robert S. Bennett)
because of the manner in which he presented the case Thursday and
Friday. ... He wants a victory. He wants to nail somebody. He wants
to get somebody, I'm sorry to say. He wants another trophy on the
wall. ...
   ``But it has been said many times, this is not a trial. This is
supposed to be a fact-finding hearing where we get an opportunity
to lay our case out for you and the American public. ...
   ``Constituent service to me is very important. ... And when a
constituent, someone from Arizona, walks in to my office, we have
no discrimination, whether they are Republican, Democrat, liberal,
conservative, rich, poor, even if they are not registered voters.
If they've got a complaint, we listen to them. ...
   ``What is wrong with intervention from someone who sends you a
check to your campaign? Nothing - no more different than what is
wrong when American Continental or their employees sent checks to
our campaigns. They didn't hand the checks to us and talk about it.
   ``We've handled 75,000 constituent cases in the 14 years that I
have been a senator. And we haven't discriminated, and we don't
talk money with them. ...
   ``Now, let me talk about the case of American Continental and
Lincoln. They came to me, as they did to other people, argued their
problem and their case, saying they were being mistreated. And I
said to them, `Give me some evidence.' ... So what did they do?
They got me some pretty powerful evidence - all us - pretty
powerful evidence. ...
   I decided to intervene. That's right. I got in there, with my
sleeves up, and decided to go for it. ...
   ``All the regulators pointed out ... we did nothing improper.
... There was no change made by what we attempted to persuade them
to do, or bring to their attention. ... We didn't do anything wrong
in any meetings. We acted as senators should have. They weren't
intimidated until a couple of years later, when they got darn
worried that they hadn't done their jobs. ...
   ``I was asked to make a status inquiry and I did. There were
jobs involved. This was a major employer. ...
   ``I've had to say some things that are difficult to say about a
brother lawyer, a fine prosecutor as far as I know, by reputation.

improper conduct. ...

yourself or your family favors or benefits under circumstances
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the
performance of their governmental duties. ...
   ``The one thing I've learned in my investigation ... is this

   Iraq will release 122 Dutch,
Belgian and British nationals who completed a
government-commissioned dredging operation, a spokesman for the
project said today.
   Those being allowed to leave are all the Westerners who worked
on the dredging project run by the Dutch companies Volker Stevin
and Koninklijke Boskalis, project spokesman Gerard Anneveldt said.
   He said the first workers will arrive home next week.
   Dutch television reported the 105 Dutchmen, 14 Belgians and 3
Britons will depart by ship.
   The $60 million dredging project was commissioned by President
Saddam Hussein's government before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
It was completed despite the U.N. trade embargo imposed Aug. 6.
   The Dutch government said at the time it regarded the project as
a service not covered by the embargo.
   Although dredging was finished several weeks ago, the workers
were not allowed to leave until Iraqi officials verified the depth
of the channel earlier this week, Anneveldt said.
   The two Dutch companies dredged a 36-mile-long channel
connecting the southern Iraqi port of Umm Qasr to a waterway
leading to the Persian Gulf.
   About 150 Dutch nationals remain in Iraq and Kuwait, including
those working on the dredging project. Hundreds of other foreigners
have been barred from leaving since Aug. 2, although Saddam has
allowed some to leave.

   President Bush will make a state visit to Turkey,
one of the front line states in the Persian Gulf crisis, within the
first six months of 1991, the White House announced today.
   He will be the first American president to visit Turkey since
Dwight D. Eisenhower stopped there in 1959.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush, during a
meeting today with Turkish President Turgut Ozal, accepted his
invitation to visit Turkey ``in the first part of 1991.'' Deputy
press secretary Roman Popadiuk defined the time frame as the first
six months of next year.
   Fitzwater said the two leaders would confirm a date soon.
   ``The president's visit will symbolize the particularly close
ties between the United States and Turkey and is intended to
contribute to a continuation of the excellent relations between the
two countries,'' Fitzwater said in a written statement.
   Turkey, which borders Iraq, has firmly aligned itself with the
United States against Baghdad.
   On Wednesday, Bush will join in the wrapup of a 34-nation summit
here and then fly to Saudi Arabia for talks with King Fahd and the
exiled leader of Kuwait, Amir Ahmad al-Sabah. Bush will visit with
U.S. troops in the Saudi kingdom on Thanksgiving Day and then fly
to Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak.

   The U.S. Army said it removed the last nuclear
missiles from a base in southern Germany today as part of a 1988
treaty with the Soviets.
   Under the treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union pledged
to get rid of their intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   The weapons removed today were nine Pershing missiles at the
base in Schwaebisch Gmuend, near Stuttgart in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a
U.S. military statement said. The United States still has 27
Pershings in Germany and they will be withdrawn gradually, the
statement said.
   The Pershings were deployed in Germany starting in 1983 to
counter Soviet SS-20 intermediate-range missiles; 108 Pershings
were deployed at the time of the treaty.

   America's crime capital imposed the city's
strictest curfew since the Atlanta child murders of the early
1980s, threatening to jail parents of youngsters caught on the
street after hours.
   Three children were caught violating the curfew, which went into
effect at 11 p.m. Monday, police said today. Two youths were picked
up by their parents from police stations. The third, a 12-year-old
girl, was taken home after her parents refused to pick her up, said
Deputy Chief W.J. Taylor.
   The girl's parents were issued a warning, Taylor said. He did
not say what time the children were picked up.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has threatened to challenge
the law, but city officials say it is needed to help the reverse
the highest rate of serious crime in the nation.
   Mayor Maynrd Jackson praised the curfew, adopted by the City
Council 13-1 on Nov. 5, as an excellent way of keeping youngsters
from being used as drug runners or lookouts.
   The measure requires those under 17 to be off the street between
11 p.m. and 6 a.m. weeknights and between midnight and 6 a.m.
weekends, unless participating in school activities, returning from
work or accompanied by an adult.
   Parents of repeat offenders could get up to 60 days in jail or
$1,000 in fines.
   Police Chief Eldrin A. Bell said officers would focus on ``known
drug locations, nightclubs and places of ill repute.''
   FBI statistics show Atlanta had 210 reported serious crimes per
1,000 residents during 1989, higher than any U.S. city. There were
246 murders in Atlanta last year, but 106 between January and June
this year, down 14 percent.
   The curfew is the latest move in the city's effort to control
crime, including the hiring of Bell as police chief three months
ago.
   During his 29 years on the force, Bell was twice demoted and
developed a reputation in some quarters as a cop willing to bust
heads first and let a judge sort things out later. He was cleared
of charges of using excessive force during a 1984 incident in which
he allegedly pistol whipped a motorist.
   The curfew is similar to one adopted at the height of a series
of 29 slayings of young blacks in metropolitan Atlanta that
terrorized the city in the early 1980s. The original curfew applied
to children 15 or younger and did not penalize their parents. It
had rarely been enforced in recent years.
   Wayne Williams was convicted in 1982 of murder in two of the 29
slayings of young blacks in metropolitan Atlanta between 1979 and
1981. Investigators have blamed him for 22 more of the slayings. He
is serving two life sentences.
   Officers who spot curfew violators are to take them home if they
live nearby. Youths from outside the area will be taken into
custody until they can be picked up by a parent.
   ``What we have asked is for parents to ultimately have
responsibility for their children,'' said City Councilwoman Davetta
Johnson, who proposed the curfew penalties.
   But Michael Hauptman, president of the local ACLU chapter, said
his organization has notified city officials that it considers the
curfew unconstitutional.
   ``In the event we receive any complaints from parents and or
children, it is our intent to take this matter into court,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A former Northwest Airlines pilot
charged with drunken driving pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and
was fined $627.
   Hans Falkenberg, 39, of Prescott, Wis., was stopped for speeding
May 28 in the Twin Cities suburb of Cottage Grove, but refused to
submit to a blood-alcohol or urine test. He was given a misdemeanor
citation accusing him of driving under the influence of alcohol and
pleaded innocent.
   When stopped, Falkenberg was on his way to work to fly a regular
passenger flight. He was fired by the Eagan-based Northwest for
violating company rules against drinking within 12 hours of a
scheduled flight. He is appealing the firing.
   Falkenberg pleaded guilty last week in Washington County
District Court in Stillwater to careless driving. He also was given
a suspended sentence of 45 days in jail and an additional $200 fine
on the condition that he commit no similar offenses and have no
alcohol or drug convictions for a year, said Cottage Grove City
Attorney Jack Clinton.
   Falkenberg has entered an alcoholism treatment program and
agreed to follow recommendations made upon completion of a chemical
dependency assessment.
   Almost three months before Falkenberg was pulled over, three
Northwest Airlines pilots were arrested after flying a passenger
plane while intoxicated from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis. The
pilots were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 12
to 16 months.

<HEAD>Sikh Militants Kill 13 in Attack on Market</HEAD>

   Suspected Sikh separatists opened fire
today on a busy shopping area of the city, killing 13 people and
injuring at least 15, police and witnesses said.
   It was the latest in a series of killings over the past few days
in the northern state of Punjab, the scene of a lingering
separatist campaign by Sikh militants.
   At least 120 people have been killed in Punjab in the past week.
Victims have included passengers pulled out of a bus and shot,
people going on morning walks and members of security forces.
   The latest attack occurred in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
About five militants entered the Krishna Kot market in the city,
cut electricity connections to the area and walked down the street
firing at shops on both sides with automatic rifles, said police
superintendent Sanjeev Gupta.
   At least 11 of the victims were Hindus and two were Sikhs, he
said.
   The site of the killing was less than a half-mile from the
Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine.
   Subhash Kumar, a resident of Krishna Kot, said many of the
victims were standing outside shops when they were gunned down.
``'I saw at least three people killed outside'' a store that rents
videocassettes, he said. ``Two others were killed in front of a
restaurant.''
   At least 15 other people were killed by the militants in other
parts of the state Monday and Tuesday, United News of India
reported. The killings were reported from separate parts of Punjab,
a rich farming state on the border with Pakistan.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab. Sikh radicals have been fighting for an
independent nation since 1982, claiming their community is
discriminated against by the Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the
country's population.
   At least 2,850 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
violence blamed on the militants.

<HEAD>Freed Spy Says Jail Changed Her Attitude Toward Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South African woman who
spent four years in a Zimbabwean prison for spying on the African
National Congress said the ordeal changed her attitude toward
blacks and the anti-apartheid movement.
   Odile Harington, 30, met with reporters Friday for the first
time since her release Nov. 1, and she blamed herself for getting
caught spying.
   ``I was naive. ... I was an idealist,'' Harington said.
   She said she decided to spy on the ANC in 1986, after a
terrorist blast injured two white children. ``At the time, I
thought that acting against the ANC was in the interests of the
country,'' she said.
   Harington was arrested in Zimbabwe that same year while posing
as an ANC supporter, and she confessed to giving Pretoria
information on ANC activities in Zimbabwe.
   The ANC, the largest black opposition group in South Africa, was
illegal in South African at the time, and many ANC guerrillas lived
in exile in sympathetic neighboring countries such as Zimbabwe.
   ``My attitude toward the ANC changed'' in prison, Harington
said. ``I was reading newspapers and seeing things from the point
of view of the Zimbabwean government. Also, living with blacks
changed my attitude in a way that wasn't possible in the South
African situation before I left.''
   Harington has refused to say who recruited her and has not
commented on her experiences in jail. It has been widely reported
that she was tortured.
   The former spy praised the changes that occurred in South Africa
during her incarceration. Zimbabwe's government said it freed and
pardoned Harington because of President F.W. de Klerk's reforms,
which include legalizing the ANC and promising to end apartheid.
   ``Things have improved and I have matured,'' she said. ``I think
it's wonderful that the government and ANC are negotiating.''
   Harington has not said what she will do in the future. She said
she didn't get paid for her spying services. The South African
government said it will help her adapt and find a job.
   Harington was originally sentenced to 25 years in prison after
her 1987 trial, but the sentence was reduced to 12 years on appeal.

<TEXT>
   Cable News Network today handed over to a federal
judge tapes of Manuel Noriega talking on the telephone from his
prison cell.
   After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate
William C. Turnoff.
   CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order
barring the network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were
broadcast before an appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
the order.
   Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal
magistrate so that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's
drug-trafficking trial, is not ``tainted'' by any disclosures about
Noriega's defense strategy.
   Noriega's attorneys claim the tapes disclose defense maneuvers
and have damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a
fair trial.
   Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and
translated from Spanish, then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler
said he didn't know how long that would take.
   The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage
Noriega's right to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a
permanent ban on further broadcasts, CNN can again appeal,
eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are confident that when Magistrate Turnoff reviews these
tapes and reports to the judge, CNN will be found not to have
violated the court order,'' said Steven Korn, lawyer for Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner.
   Korn said the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   On Monday, a Noriega attorney, Jon May, also said he would ask
for an immediate contempt hearing aimed at forcing CNN to pay fines
of up to $300,000 for each violation of the judge's order. He said
he would ask the all-news network for a log of how many times it
aired the tapes.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that General Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said of his proposal that fines against CNN be used for
Noriega's attorneys.
   CNN's attorney said the network doesn't expect to pay any fines.
He said that the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   The fines could help solve another problem plaguing the defense
- a freeze on Noriega's bank accounts that has kept him from paying
his lawyers.
   The private attorneys have said they cannot stay on the case
without some money. Hoeveler said last week he would decide soon
whether to give Noriega government-paid counsel instead.
   The dispute over the tapes has raised questions about
attorney-client confidentiality, the right to a fair trial and the
First Amendment.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli officer and four Palestinian
guerrillas died in an eight-hour firefight in southern Lebanon
after the Israelis ambushed the guerrilla squad, police said today.
   Police said two Palestinians, including the commander of the
raiding party, were wounded in the ambush by about 75 Israeli
soldiers and allied Lebanese militiamen near this village in the
foothills of Mount Hermon.
   A Lebanese army corporal driving along a nearby road was also
hurt.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said 1st Lt. Yaron Yogev, 23, was
shot and killed after his unit spotted and attacked the guerrilla
squad on Monday night.
   The army statement also said that a fifth guerrilla may have
been killed in the firefight. It did not mention the participation
of Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen.
   Police said the battle with machine guns and rocket-propelled
grenades raged under parachute flares for eight hours before the
Israelis and the militiamen of the South Lebanon Army pulled back
three to five miles south to the security zone Israel maintains
north of its border.
   The bodies of the four slain Palestinians remained on the
battleground near Ain Atta at daybreak after the Israelis and
militiamen withdrew at 4 a.m., a police spokesman said.
   ``They may be booby-trapped. Explosive experts are needed to
examine the corpses before removing them,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   He said Israel and the South Lebanon Army must have been tipped
in advance about the raid to lay the ambush for the 14 raiders, who
belonged to Samir Ghoshe's Palestine Popular Struggle Front.
   The group claimed responsibility in a statement distributed in
Beirut.
   The Front, backed and financed by Libya, is among the most
militant hard-line factions of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization. But the group had seldom been involved in attacks
against Israel or its security enclave in southern Lebanon in the
past.
   The Front commander and his assistant, who was also wounded,
were seen heading back with eight surviving attackers to the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon.
   ``We belong to the Palestine Popular Liberation Front and
Libya's Revolutionary committee,'' one guerrilla shouted to a small
group of reporters, flashing the V-for-victory sign. ``I'll shoot
you if you take pictures.''
   Israel has controlled the zone since it withdrew the bulk of its
army from Lebanon in 1985 after three years of occupation. It said
it needed a buffer area against guerrilla raids, but Lebanon
frequently accuses Israel of seeking to expand its territory
permanently.
   The enclave covers 440 square miles from the Mediterranean coast
to Mount Hermon slopes. It is controlled by the 3,000-member South
Lebanon Army, supported by 1,000 Israeli soldiers.
   A senior Israeli official said the Israeli army would continue
to operate beyond the security zone to foil guerrilla actions.
   ``When we think there are going to be terrorist attacks on
Israel from outside the security zone, we feel that we have a free
hand to act in order to prevent in advance attempts to
infiltrate,'' said Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press
Office.
   Olmert said there had been 17 infiltration attempts by land and
sea this year in which 36 Arabs and two Israelis were killed.
   ``None of them has reached Israel itself and this is exactly why
it is vitally important for us, even more than before, to emphasize
the significance of this security zone as an effective buffer,'' he
told reporters.

   The army will distribute hundreds of thousands
of balloon-like gas mask attachments to observant Jews who cannot
wear the standard mask because of their beards, an army official
said today.
   The daily Maariv said the special attachments will ensure a
tight fit despite facial hair and will cost the government $20
million.
   Israel began distributing gas masks to the entire population on
Oct. 15 because of the Persian Gulf crisis and Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's threat to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
   The problem for observant Jews comes because religious law
forbids men from shaving, and the standard gas masks don't seal
properly over facial hair.
   The army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under
military regulations, said the attachment is a flexible covering
that extends out from the mask to include the beard within the area
sealed from contamination.
   The Civil Defense Corps developed the attachments despite a
ruling by one of Israel's chief rabbis, Mordechai Eliyahu, saying
ultra-Orthodox Jews could shave their beards to save their lives.
   In issuing the ruling in August, Eliyahu urged men to carry
razors in their pockets to be prepared for a chemical attack.
   Rabbinical rulings notwithstanding, Maarive noted the special
attachments were developed because the Defense Ministry was under
pressure from small but influential ultra-Orthodox political
parties.
   The army official said distribution of the special attachments
would begin next week in Bnei Brak, a religious suburb of Tel Aviv.
Maariv said a total of about 600,000 attachments would be handed
out.
   The army official said the Civil Defense Corps had been flooded
with special requests since the gas mask distribution began.
   ``Every time a different group comes with different problems,''
he said. ``We have the children with asthma, and the beard-wearers
were also a problem.''

   San Marino. Liechtenstein. Luxembourg. Smaller than
many state parks in the United States, these tiny European nations
have an equal place at the Paris summit table with the mighty
United States and Soviet Union.
   Tuesday's session symbolized the egalitarian principles on which
the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is
based.
   A key speaker was Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the master
of Europe's economic powerhouse. The chair was held by Gabriele
Gatti, head of government of SanMarino, population 21,000.
   It may seem like a joke that tiny states, surviving largely on
the sale of postage stamps or on quirky tax laws attracting
visitors to cheap, duty-free shopping, take their place in such a
lofty forum.
   San Marino has seven embassies, but is normally represented
abroad by Italy, which surrounds it. Liechtenstein has ceded
diplomatic representation to neighboring Switzerland.
   But the presence of small states at this summit reminds mightier
leaders of two crises they now face: Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and
the rising nationalism of numerically small peoples all over
Eastern Europe.
   Edward Fenech-Adami, prime minister of tiny Malta, summed up the
perils of ignoring small states in his summit speech Monday.
   ``The aggressive action by Iraq is an eye-opener to the
essential need for small states to receive special consideration in
devising a realistic system of security,'' he noted.
   A common theme of many summit speeches has been the need to
confront the enflamed ethnic passions in Eastern Europe, where
nationalism could undo the gains of democracy in the past year.
   In its 15-year history, the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe has advanced by accepting that the borders
drawn by World War II, which plonked millions of people in Eastern
Europe outside the nations to which they culturally belong, are
final.
   It must therefore now find a way to give voice to the demands of
Europe's many ethnic minorities, and accommodate emerging states
such as the Baltic lands of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia.
   Soviet objections have guaranteed so far that the three Baltic
republics - whose 1940 annexation remains unrecognized by the
United States - cannot attain even observer status at the
Conference.
   Washington says only that the Baltics should eventually take
their place at the CSCE, but that it does not wish to meddle in
Moscow's affairs by demanding recognition of Baltic independence.
   As so often in the 15 years of the CSCE, it took smaller nations
to bring the issue into the public eye: Czechoslovakia's Vaclav
Havel, lauded by many speakers for his role in last year's East
European revolutions, and Denmark's premier Poul Schlueter.
   This symbolized the vital part often played by the smaller
states in bringing Europe to the consensus that protects the
interests of all CSCE participants and thus remains the principle
of all its decisions.
   At virtually all CSCE conferences, the neutral and non-aligned
nations - those not in NATO or the now-crumbling Warsaw Pact - have
worked to mesh the rival demands of East and West on everything
from human rights to the environment.
   The tiny city-state of the Vatican is another important player.
Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Pope's Secretary of State, gently
reminded the summit Monday that ``the Holy Chair is, in fact, a
power.''
   Although occupying a tiny corner of European territory, Casaroli
noted, the Vatican is ``a `power' engaged in every part of the
world ... exercising its universal mission.''

<HEAD>Norway Announces Environment Fund Financed by Oilfield Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway intends to set up a fund, financed by a tax
on its offshore oilfields, to help less wealthy countries combat
global warning, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland told
leaders from 34 nations Tuesday.
   She told European and North American leaders attending the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that environmental
protection should be a significant part of any plans for regional
or world security.
   ``The rehabilitation of our European environment will be a test
case of whether we are capable of dealing with our common
responsibilities,'' she said.
   She called on the leaders to ``take the lead in the effort to
save our common future, such as in the negotiations in a world
climate convention.''
   To implement environmental agreements ``wealthier countries must
make financial and technological resources available,'' she said in
announcing the Norwegian fund.
   In Oslo, press spokesman Egil Helle at the oil and energy
department said the tax would be on natural gas coming from
Norway's extensive North Sea oilfields.
   Norway is one of Europe's largest producers of oil and gas, two
of the principal hydrocarbons that when burned produce carbon
dioxide, a ``greenhouse'' gas that scientists say appears to be
causing a rise in global temperatures.
   Mrs. Brundtland's minority Labor Party has said the tax would
generate several hundred thousand dollars, a portion of which would
be used to finance the climate fund.
   Environmentalists have urged an international accord setting up
a multilateral climate fund to help less affluent countries develop
cleaner energy technologies and develop energy efficient systems.
   Earlier this year, a global fund was set up at an international
conference in London to help developing countries cut their
emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The United States, which produces about one-fourth of the
world's carbon dioxide, has led the countries opposing a similar
fund to deal with global warming.

<HEAD>City Hall Going Broke? Tourists Don't Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city may be in danger of going broke,
but one facet of its economy is booming: Tourists are showing up in
droves.
   Bookings are nearly double at the Convention and Visitors Bureau
and the trolley tour company tha takes people to the Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall has added a second line and is considering
two more.
   Visitors to Independence Hall last weekend said they'd heard
about the city's fiscal mess. But they had no second thoughts about
making the trip.
   ``That wouldn't keep us away,'' said Jamie Robinson of San Jose,
Calif. ``We traveled 3,000 miles and we're going to see all we
can.''
   The only question is what happens if the money crunch gets so
bad that trash pickup, police and fire protection are affected.
Short of that happening, said Bruce Wolfepacke, manager of the
American Trolley Tour Co., ``I don't see the city going broke as
affecting us.''
   The city isn't due to run out of money until after the $30
million payroll on Dec. 14. The mayor, the council and the state
haven't been able to agree on a rescue plan.
   That doesn't worry Tom Muldoon, president of the Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
   ``The amount of money that the city is short is not an enormous
amount,'' Muldoon said.
   ``Eventually, they are going to work this out at City Hall. It's
just a question of who bites the aspirin - or who owns the
aspirin.''
   From July through October the bureau booked 134 convention and
tourist groups in Philadephia for a total of 127,000 room-nights,
Muldoon said. That's up from the same four-month period of 1989,
when the bureau booked 101 groups for 65,000 room-nights.
   Pat Walsh of Centipede Tours, a source of guides and
transportation for tour groups all over the city, said business is
looking good for next year, too.
   ``We already have 500 tours booked for next year,'' she said,
adding that her company averages 2,000 to 2,500 tours annually.
   ``It's early to have that many bookings,'' she said. ``I can't
figure it out, but I'll take it.''
   All that brisk business comes in spite of direct economic
effects on tousit attractions.
   City-owned attractions like Betsy Ross House and the
Philadelphia Zoo have suffered problems unseen by tourists, such as
hiring freezes and slightly curtailed hours.
   And eight historic buildings at Independence National Historical
Park remain closed because the National Park Service didn't budget
enough money.
   In 1989, tourists spent $142 million in the Philadelphia area,
of which $8.1 million went to local governments, according to a
report for the Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   The more than 4,500 people employed in tourism contribute
directly to city coffers through the wage tax of 4.96 percent on
city residents and 4.3125 percent on non-residents who work in the
city.
   Nearly half of the city's $2.2 billion general fund comes from
the wage tax. No breakdown was available of how much tourism
industry workers contributed, but the overall tax raised $918.2
million last year and is projected to raise $954.9 million in
fiscal 1991.
   Other tourism-related contributions to the city treasury include
a 5 percent amusement tax on sporting events and concerts, which
raised $6 million for the 12 months ended June 30 and is projected
to bring in $6.2 million this fiscal year.
   A 5 percent hotel tax raised $7.8 million in fiscal 1990 and is
expected to raise $8.7 million this year.

   Here are the latest developments in the Persian Gulf crisis:
   ---
   Saddam Hussein called on parliament to free all Germans held
hostage in Iraq. In releasing the Germans, the Iraqi president
contrasted Bonn's attitude with that of Washington and London.
   ``The decision of banning some foreigners from travel was
adopted on the hope of giving reckless minds in the administration
of (President) Bush and (British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher
an opportunity to delay in carrying on the procedure toward the
abyss of evil,'' INA quoted him as saying. Iraqi officials said
approval was certain.
   ---
   A group of 45 House Democrats filed suit Tuesday to try to force
President Bush to seek authority from Congress before ordering a
U.S. military attack to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction to bar Bush ``from launching or
initiating an offensive military attack by United States forces
against Iraq without obtaining a declaration of war or other
explicit authorization from the Congress.
   ---
   In Baghdad, there was another sign Tuesday that the trade
embargo is having an impact. The state press said the country's
legislature had voted to impose the death penalty on anyone
hoarding wheat, barley, rice, corn and other grains for trading
purposes.
   ---
   Indian news reports said Tuesday that Iraq is refusing to allow
an Indian ship, its crew and 14 Red Cross workers to leave until it
unloads more than 4,700 tons of rice. The ship docked at the Iraqi
port of Umm Qasr in September with 10,000 tons of food for Indians
in Iraq and Kuwait. It had been scheduled to leave with some of its
cargo.
   ---
   Iraq will release 122 Dutch, Belgian and British nationals who
completed a government-commissioned dredging operation, a spokesman
for the project said Tuesday. Those being allowed to leave are all
the Westerners who worked on the dredging project run by the Dutch
companies Volker Stevin and Koninklijke Boskalis, project spokesman
Gerard Anneveldt said.
   ---
   In a joint New York Times-CBS poll published Tuesday, 47 percent
of respondents said the Bush administration has been too quick to
get U.S. forces involved and has not been diligent enough about
seeking diplomatic solutions.
   Only 38 percent felt the same way in August, the poll said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President
Bush are planning a January summit in Moscow, U.S. and Soviet
officials said today.
   U.S. officials in Washington said they were confident obstacles
to a long-range nuclear weapons treaty could be resolved in time
for the meeting, and that setting a summit date could spur
negotiations.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush is
keeping to his plan only to hold a Moscow summit if a Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty was ready for signing. But they expressed
confidence the outstanding issues could be resolved by the first
half of January.
   The two leaders discussed the treaty, which would reduce their
long-range nuclear missiles by up to 50 percent, at a dinner
meeting Monday night, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Soviet spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko did not tie the summit to an
arms reduction signing.
   He said only, ``U.S. President George Bush will pay an official
visit to Moscow at the beginning of January.''
   Asked about an agreement, he said, ``If it's ready, they will
sign it.''
   It would be the fourth summit for Bush and Gorbachev, not
counting their Monday dinner.
   `It's obviously within our grasp,'' an official said of the
elusive pact to reduce long-range bombers, missiles and submarines.
``If you don't use the summit as an opportunity it may slide
away.''
   Bush and Gorbachev are in Paris participating in a 34-nation
summit charting the course of the world now that Cold War divisions
have ended.
   On Monday, leaders of NATO and the Warsaw Pact attending the
summit signed an agreement drastically reducing their conventional
forces of tanks and other weapons throughout Europe. It is the most
far-reaching arms control accord in history.
   Bush had hoped to go to Moscow in December to sign the START
pact, but negotiators are still wrestling with three major
unresolved issues. They are:
   --The kinds of testing and other restrictions to impose on the
154 heavy, ground-based SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles
the Soviet will retain under the treaty.
   --Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapon, as the United States demands. That would mean
counting Backfires against numerical weapons limits established in
the treaty.
   --The restrictions to be imposed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies. This issue primarily
concerns arms Washington would like to turn over to Britain outside
the treaty's limits.
   The two leaders held their first summit, to get to know one
another, on board ships moored off the Mediterranean island of
Malta in December 1989.
   They met again in May 1990 in Washington, where Bush and
Gorbachev signed agreements to eliminate chemical weapons and
complete a treaty to slash long-range nuclear arsenals.
   Their last summit was in Helsinki on Sept. 9. That one-day
meeting was devoted largely to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has no
plan to resign from the Cabinet, his chief spokeswoman said
Tuesday, denying speculation he would soon step down.
   Rumbles have sounded on Capitol Hill and elsewhere that Yeutter
was headed for greener pastures following completion of the 1990
farm bill and the conclusion next month of international trade
talks.
   One of the latest to surface is that Yeutter might be in line
for an ambassadorship, perhaps to Germany, if that should become
available.
   Kelly Shipp, who has been Yeutter's press secretary since 1987
when he was President Reagan's U.S. trade representative, said
reports of his leaving the cabinet soon - perhaps within 90 days -
are ``not true.''
   Specifically, on Yeutter seeking or being touted for an
ambassador's job, Shipp said that is ``not true, absolutely,
patently false.''
   Yeutter, with Shipp in his entourage, just returned from a week
of meetings in Europe where the Uruguay Round of talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is stalled over agricultural
strategy.
   The U.S. view, advocated vigorously by Yeutter for years, is
that trade-distorting policies, including export subsidies and some
internal price supports, are bad for everybody.
   Some countries share the U.S. position, but others - notably the
European Community - are still balking. As a result, the Uruguay
Round of trade talks could wind up at an impasse on some of the
major agricultural issues.
   ``People have always speculated that the secretary was going to
leave after the Uruguay Round,'' Shipp said. ``But he never said
that, he doesn't feel that way. He hasn't even focused on life
after (USDA), whenever that's going to be.''
   When President-elect George Bush chose him as secretary of
agriculture in December 1988, it was reported that Yeutter had
really wanted to get back into the private sector after 3{ years on
the trade job.
   There was also talk at the time that Yeutter and Bush had agreed
the Agriculture Department commitment would last only through the
formulation of the 1990 farm bill - which is awaiting Bush's
signature - and the conclusion of the GATT negotiations.
   But Shipp said Yeutter made no such deal with Bush. ``He and the
president never talked about his departure,'' she said.
   Yeutter, who will be 60 on Dec. 10, has an interest in a
2,500-acre family farming operation in Nebraska. He holds
doctorates in law and economics and has held many public and
private posts, including Agriculture Department service in the
early 1970s and president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from
1978 to 1985.

<HEAD>`Carnal Knowledge' by Jules Feiffer Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his cartoons, Jules Feiffer is a master at
analyzing relationships between men and women.
   He can capture the peculiarities of their anxieties with a few
words and a few frenzied line drawings. What's more, his
observations are scalpel-sharp, very funny and quick to the point.
   But the writer runs into trouble trying to extend those
observations into a whole evening of theater. That was the problem
with his last play, ``Elliott Loves,'' and it is the problem with
``Carnal Knowledge,'' an older Feiffer work that became a
well-known Mike Nichols movie some 20 years ago.
   Now the stage version finally has arrived in New York, opening
Monday at off-Broadway's tiny, 99-seat Kaufman Theater, and it's a
tedious evening of theater.
   ``Carnal Knowledge'' - the play - seems like a darker, more
morose version of one of Feiffer's fine comic strips but stretched
beyond endurance. It flattens the actors and exhausts the audience.
   The 1971 film version starred Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel,
Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret. This production has the lure of
three young stars - Jon Cryer, Judd Nelson and Justine Bateman plus
one newcomer, Karen Byers - in pivotal roles. None is shown to good
advantage, particularly in a disastrous second act.
   ``Carnal Knowledge'' covers a nearly 20-year period, following
two Amherst College graduates from the late 1940s into the swinging
'60s. The play is at its best in the opening scenes when the two
college students - Sandy, played by Cryer and Jonathan, played by
Nelson - solemnly discuss the mysteries of women and more
specifically, sex.
   ``Are you going to let your wife work?'' goes one discussion.
``Is it better to love or be loved?'' goes another.
   Sandy is a naive romantic, Jonathan a cynical lout whose vision
of women never gets much beyond the bedroom. Sandy meets Susan, a
woman who ends up being much too smart for him but who eventually
is bedded by Jonathan.
   Act 2 jumps nearly 20 years, but the two lead actors don't seem
to age at all. The baby-faced Cryer, who is quite affecting in the
first act as the innocent Sandy, looks completely out of place
after intermission as an older, successful doctor who does marry
Susan and has three children.
   Nelson's character is more intriguing, but the actor's
performance doesn't vary. Jonathan's repulsive, one-note treatment
of women eventually becomes boring and Nelson emphasizes that
relentless quality. Justine Bateman gives a zombie-like performance
as Susan, and when the woman disappears after the first act, she
isn't missed.
   But the women who replace her in the lives of Sandy and Jonathan
- a neurotic model played by Karen Byers and an aggressive, mannish
girlfriend played stridently by Mimi Quillin - are even less
sympathetic. The evening degenerates into a series of unhappy
conversations between two unhappy men about their unhappy love
lives.
   The bare-bones evening, directed by Martin Charnin, has the feel
of a glorified workshop production. The setting is minimal, except
for an unnecessary turntable that spins around several times for no
discernable reason on the small stage.
   Charnin uses his actors remarkably well, with the action
shifting very quickly from conversation to conversation. But the
problem with ``Carnal Knowledge'' is that what these characters are
talking about isn't very interesting in the first place.

<TEXT>
   In a Hollywood time warp, a filmmaker
is unearthing an ancient Egyptian city, built and buried not by
pharaohs but by legendary director Cecil B. DeMille.
   Archaeologists are uncovering the City of the Pharaohs, erected
for DeMille's 1923 silent film ``The Ten Commandments,'' with as
much enthusiasm as if it were a real Egyptian city.
   ``This is utterly unique,'' said Jarell Jackman, executive
director of the Santa Barbara Trust for Historical Preservation.
``It gives you a sense of time having passed - that movies are now
part of history.
   ``Some archaeologist may be uncovering Disneyland 500 years from
now.''
   The movie city, one of the largest sets in film history,
included walls 110 feet high and 75 feet wide. The entrance was
flanked by four 35-foot Pharaoh statues and 21 huge sphinxes.
   When he was finished with the movie, DeMille had the set buried
in the local sand dunes.
   A search of the northern Santa Barbara County site with
ground-penetrating radar shows that much of the original set
remains intact, said archaeologist John Parker, who compared the
readings with old charts of the movie set.
   The readings show large objects in the place where the sphinxes
should be, leading excavators to believe the statues remain intact.
   Peter Brosnan, a Los Angeles screenwriter and documentary
filmmaker, is spearheading the campaign to get financing for the
excavation project and secured a $10,000 grant from the Bank of
America.
   Brosnan dug up one of DeMille's horse heads on a 1983 trip to
the dunes about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and then
started to preserve the site as a historical treasure.
   ``It's a hobby that got out of control,'' he said.
   On Monday, Brosnan proudly showed off some unearthed treasures.
   ``Take a look at this guy,'' he said. ``That's the Pharaoh.''
   Brosnan will use the excavation to help complete a documentary
video on DeMille and the buried set.

   A portrait of Jacqueline Picasso, whose dark beauty
and intense gaze fascinated Spanish artist Pablo Picasso for nearly
30 years, enchanted Barbara Bush during a tour Tuesday of recently
acquired masterpieces.
   Mrs. Bush was accompanied by Michele Rocard, wife of French
Premier Michel Rocard, and several other wives of government
leaders attending the 34-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   The ladies were divided into four groups for their 45-tour of
the Grand Palais, where more than 400 paintings, lithographs,
drawings, sketch books, sculpture and ceramics are on public
display until Jan. 14.
   ``Jacqueline Aux Mains Croisees'' (Jacqueline With Crossed
Hands), executed in 1954 in the early days of her relationship with
the artist, shows the young dancer sitting on the floor, her hands
hugging her knees.
   The works, which once belonged to Jacqueline, Picasso's second
wife, were donated to the government by her daughter, Catherine, in
partial payment of inheritance taxes. Jacqueline Picasso committed
suicide in 1986, never having recovered from her husband's death.
   Wearing an elegant, bright red dress adorned with waist-high
gold buttons and a flared, pleated skirt designed by Arnold Scaasi,
Mrs. Bush listened attentively to explanations provided by Gerard
Regnier, the head curator of the Picasso Museum.
   ``Is she crying?'' Mrs. Bush asked, looking closely at the
painting.
   ``She's beautiful, with that look of an Egyptian sphinx. I think
she's my favorite,'' she said.
   The portrait is the highlight of the exhibition, the first
portrait of Jacqueline - Picasso painted more than 70 during their
29 years together - to enter France's national collections.
   Asked how she liked Picasso's view of women, Mrs. Bush just
raised her eyebrows.
   The American first lady was also fascinated by the dozens of
sketch books displayed in glass cases under dim light. Picasso's
hands were never idle, and he would draw in accounting books, on
newspaper, cardboard - even tablecloths and napkins.
   ``I can't imagine he kept them all. I wanted to go through them
page by page,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   Raisa Gorbachev, dressed in a mustard suit with black buttons
and black sweater, did not visit the exhibition. She joined the
group for lunch at the Hotel Matignon, the official residence of
the French premier.
   The guests dined on lobster stew in sea urchin sauce, filet of
beef, cheese, fruit and sherbet, washed down with two vintage
wines.
   Mrs. Bush ended the afternoon with a visit to the famed Pasteur
Institute, named for the French scientist Louis Pasteur and now a
respected AIDS research center.
   Mrs. Bush, accompanied by Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the
French president, was not allowed inside the research labs that
contain the deadly virus.
  ``We didn't get within spitting distance,'' she said.

<HEAD>Financial Woes Could Derail New York City's Education, Anti-Crime
Plans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plans to crack down on crime and boost the
quality of education in New York City could be gutted by the
state's financial woes, say city officials bracing for the loss of
millions of dollars.
   A plan unveiled Saturday to wipe out a state budget deficit of
nearly $1 billion will cost the city about $100 million this year,
Gov. Mario Cuomo said. But Mayor David Dinkins said ``an initial
review suggests these costs may be greater.''
   The cutbacks come after Dinkins already announced plans for
layoffs and service reductions to close a city budget shortfall of
$400 million this fiscal year and $1.6 million next year.
   ``We have no buffer left,'' lamented city Budget Director Philip
Michael. ``There's nothing left under a rock.''
   Officials also say the lost revenues could cripple Dinkins' $1.8
billion plan to hire 6,500 more police officers and the city's
agreement to increase teacher salaries 5.5 percent.
   The plan to beef up the Police Department was to be paid for by
a payroll tax on city residents and commuters that would require
the state Legislature's approval. It already faced stiff opposition
before Cuomo announced his proposed cutbacks.
   ``This is not the most positive climate for seeking any tax
increase,'' noted Thomas Reppetto, director of the Citizens Crime
Commission.
   Cuomo's plan also seemed to generate new pressure on Dinkins to
back out of the city's Oct. 1 agreement with its teachers for 5.5
percent pay raises.
   Cuomo wants to reduce state aid to the city's schools by more
than $70 million - money city officials were counting on for the
teachers' raises.
   Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez also said the budget cuts
could result in the layoffs of as many as 4,000 school employees,
most of them teachers.
   United Federation of Teachers spokesman Bert Shanas said the
union would fight to keep the increases.
   ``As far as we are concerned, we have a legal binding
contract,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is considering Rep. Lynn Martin
of Illinois to succeed outgoing Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, an
administration source said Tuesday.
   Martin, who earlier this month lost a bid for the Senate seat
held by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., told Bush last Thursday that she
was interested in the secretary's job, said the source, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   A 10-year House Republican, Martin had talked to Bush about the
job immediately after she lost the Nov. 6 election and then again
last week before he left for his Thanksgiving trip to Europe and
Saudi Arabia, the source said.
   Martin has also discussed the matter with presidential chief of
staff John Sununu, the source said.
   Constance Newman, director of the Office of Personnel
Management, is the other candidate most frequently mentioned to
replace Mrs. Dole, who is stepping down this week to become
president of the American Red Cross.
   Mrs. Newman, one of the Bush administration's highest ranking
women, is not discussing her job prospects, said an OPM spokesman.
He said he did not know if she had been contacted by the White
House.
   The administration source who said Martin had been contacted
said he did not know if the White House had discussed the job with
anyone else.
   Martin was unavailable for comment Tuesday because she was in
Oman representing Bush on a ceremonial mission.
   Martin, who gave up her House seat to make the failed effort to
unseat Simon, would give the Bush administration a cabinet
secretary with strong congressional ties.
   However, Martin has never had a close alliance with organized
labor. Her best voting score from the AFL-CIO came in 1988, when
she got a 46 out of a possible 100 on issues tracked by the
14.2-million-member labor federation.
   When Bush tapped Mrs. Dole for the labor post two years ago, his
action was seen as a way for Republicans to mend fences with
organized labor leaders who had endured a hostile relationship with
the Reagan administration.
   Both Martin and Mrs. Newman would also give Bush the opportunity
to replace Mrs. Dole with another woman. Martin is white; Mrs.
Newman is black.
   The source said he did not know when Bush would make a decision
about Mrs. Dole's replacement.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, will officially leave office Friday. Deputy Labor
Secretary Roderick DeArment will serve as acting secretary until a
replacement is named and confirmed by the Senate. Congress does not
return until January.

   Budget cuts at Massachusetts fairs
have left some blue-ribbon winners seeing red.
   ``Dear Mr. Dukakis. ... What did you do with it all?''
10-year-old Melissa Belski wrote to the governor after learning the
$78 she won this summer for several entries would not be
forthcoming due to a $300,000 budget cut at the Division of Fairs.
   Melissa, of Great Barrington, felt she had earned that money.
She had entered two lambs, a cross-stitched sachet, flower
arrangements, hand-dipped candles and photos.
   She eventually got her prize money, partly through donations
from well-wishers who had read about her situation. But others were
not so fortunate, said division director Stephen F. Quinn.
   ``The fairs were allotted the money. After the fairs were all
held and all was said and done, I was informed that the monies were
gone,'' Quinn said.
   The cuts, which came in a year when millions were slashed,
didn't attract much attention at first. But since then, the
reaction has ranged from the girl's letter to winners in Greenfield
giving their prizes back in a gesture of support for their local
fair.
   Barber Harold Sears was among those who turned $200 back to the
Franklin County Fair after learning it was having to come up with
the prize money itself.
   ``Agriculture is the last thing that our politicians are
thinking about and they control the purse strings. This is one way
of kind of satisfying ourselves a little bit that we are doing
something worthwhile,'' Sears said.
   Larger fairs dipped into reserve funds to make good on prizes;
smaller outfits couldn't afford that, Quinn said.
   Many of the fairs hardest hit were in the Berkshires, including
the Great Barrington Fair, said state Sen. Peter Webber. Webber
hopes to get at least part of the lost $300,000 restored when the
Legislature reconvenes.
   ``It's a promise that was made and they had every right to
expect that if they won the prize there'd be a premium paid,'' he
said.
   Quinn said he doubted fairs could afford a second year without
prize money, which would discourage exhibitors, especially young
people who rely on the prizes to defray travel and other costs.
   ``Everybody in the system is going to hurt,'' he said.

   A national test should be created so
graduating high school students can demonstrate to American
business an ability to read, write and compute ``at world-class
levels,'' a business leader told a House panel Tuesday.
   ``Business has lost confidence that a high school diploma
reflects actual skills gained,'' William H. Kolberg, president of
the National Alliance of Business, told a subcommittee of the House
Committee on Education and Labor.
   Kolberg said the government must set up a framework for a
national examination system that would be administered by the
states. Student abilities would be assessed on the basis of
predetermined national basic skills requirements, he said.
   There is growing controversy over the need to test all students
leaving high school - not just those interested in attending
college. Kolberg's comments come less than a week after the head of
the nation's largest testing organization opposed the idea in a
letter to the president's Education Policy Advisory Committee.
   Gregory Anrig, president of the Educational Testing Service,
said a proposed exam to judge students and their schools would be
unnecessary, unwarranted and wasteful.
   The president's panel reportedly is preparing to recommend
national testing of all students in grades four, eight and 12.
   ``Business, certainly, needs assurance that students have
achieved a certain level of competency upon graduation no matter
where in the country they went to school,'' Kolberg told the
subcommittee on elementary, secondary and vocational education.
   The National Alliance of Business, founded in 1968 by Henry Ford
II and President Lyndon Johnson, is a non-profit organization with
2,800 businesses as members.
   A recent alliance poll of personnel officers at the 1,200
largest U.S. corporations found that only 36 percent were satisfied
with the competency of new employees entering the work force. Also,
business leaders thought that both reading and math competency had
slipped in the past five years.
   Kolberg said ``a system of national standards coupled with
assessment would ensure that every student leaves compulsory school
with a demonstrated ability to read, write, compute, and perform at
world-class levels in general school subjects.''
   While generally supporting the idea, Sol Hurwitz, president of
the Committee for Economic Development, told the panel the
government first must make sure that all students have equal
educational opportunities. That would require greater financial
support for such early childhood education programs as Head Start,
he said.
   William Lurie, president of the Business Roundtable, said his
association of more than 200 chief executive officers of large
corporations is considering support in the next Congress for an
initiative to expand use of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress.
   NAEP, popularly called the nation's report card, is the only
national assessment of what American students know and can do.
Since 1969, nationwide samples have been taken in reading,
mathematics, science, writing, history, geography and other
subjects.

<HEAD>Roof Wrangle Threatens Damp Christmas at Church of the Nativity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It could be a wet Christmas for pilgrims in
Bethlehem this year because Christian sects are squabbling over who
should repair the leaking roof above Christ's birthplace.
   There is little disagreement that the roof of the ancient Church
of the Nativity needs fixing. Even last winter, worshipers had to
weave their way among buckets set out inside the basilica to
collect winter rainwater.
   But the question of who should perform the repair work gets
tangled up in complex rules dating to the 1850s on which sect
controls which section of the church.
   Unfortunately, repair of the roof is not specifically mentioned
in the codes.
   Clerics of the Greek Orthodox Church traditionally clean the
roof, and they argue that this is precedent for doing the repairs.
   Twice in the past week - once in the dead of night - Greek
Orthodox have sneaked to the roof to do the deed.
   Both efforts drew letters of protest from the Roman Catholics
and Armenians, and on Monday the Israeli army intervened.
   ``If you've seen the physical condition of the basilica you know
the problems,'' Shmuel Hamburger, the Israeli military government's
liaison with the churchmen, said Tuesday. ``The dispute between the
three communities over who will do what in repairs means it goes
unrepaired.''
   Hamburger said the Israeli government was willing to do the
work, as Israel and other governing powers like Jordan and the
British did before.
   Now, as in the past, the three communities could send
representatives to supervise, he said.
   Greek Orthodox church officials could not be reached for comment
despite repeated telephone calls. Newspaper reports say the church
is adamant that the roof is its property and can only be repaired
by the Greek Orthodox.
   The dark and musty church was built by Constantine in the year
330 and restored and enlarged in the sixth century by Byzantine
Emperor Justinian. It is believed to be the oldest Christian church
in continuous use.
   Year round, but especially at Christmas, pilgrims flock to the
stone structure, which stands above a grotto believed to be the
site where the Christ child was born.
   Tourism has been sharply reduced by both the three-year
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and
the more-recent Persian Gulf crisis, but Israeli tourism officials
predict some pickup at the holiday.
   The church has miraculously escaped most ravages of conquering
armies. Legend has it, for example, that the Persians left it alone
in the seventh century because the garb of the three wise men in
mosaics on the facade was similar to their own dress.
   The roof didn't fare as well. In 1482, Edward IV of England
supplied lead for a new roof. Ottoman Turks removed it in the early
part of the 17th century to make ammunition.
   Worship and maintainance of the church is regulated by a code,
known as ``the Status Quo,'' that was developed by the Turks to
prevent just such disputes as the roof wrangle. The code was
accepted by the British, Jordanian and Israelis.
   The code is very specific. For example, the silver star that
marks Christ's birthplace is dusted daily by the Greek Orthodox;
twice each week, the Orthodox and the Armenians wash it. The nearby
manger is exclusively under Roman Catholic control.
   George Hintlian, a spokesman for the Armenian community,
believes the roof dispute will be resolved amicably.
   ``This is a periodic repair,'' Hintlian noted. ``It has been
done twice under the Israelis, twice under the Jordanians before
them.''
   He said the situation called for cooperation: ``When something
is not part of the status quo, it must be done by consensus.''
   Hamburger says Israel is willing to get to work. Asked if it
could be completed by Christmas, he said:
   ``It depends on the weather ... and so on.''

<HEAD>San Francisco To Move Hiring Halls Indoors From Street Corners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hiring halls are being revived for the
city's hundreds of day laborers, mostly immigrants, who now crowd
street corners in the largely Hispanic Mission District hoping to
catch the eye of passing contractors.
   Corner job lines provide the best work prospects for unskilled,
often undocumented laborers with little or no English.
   But the gatherings draw complaints from residents and businesses
who say men discouraged by a fruitless day of waiting intimidate
customers and make neighborhoods unsafe.
   And labor advocates say disorganization and desperation leave
day workers vulnerable to dishonest employers.
   ``When it's done in the chaos of the street, you have the
problem of people being cheated and people being hurt,'' said San
Francisco Supervisor Jim Gonzalez. ``We're hoping to restore
dignity to people who just want to get a job, if only for a day.''
   A $70,000 pilot project expected to begin in February would
provide access to jobs with fair wages, a record of one's employer,
and services such as toilets, telephone numbers where a worker
could be reached in an emergency, and a cup of coffee.
   Workers would show up at the hiring hall each morning and put
their names on slips of paper that contractors draw from pools
divided by skill, Gonzalez said.
   The system is patterned after a program in Los Angeles.
   About 60 of the 300 people who show up at two hiring halls in
Los Angeles find work each day, said Bill Molina, coordinator of
the Los Angeles day labor program. By comparison, Gonzalez
estimates only 10 percent of casual workers in San Francisco get
work by standing on a corner.
   Molina concedes that the 13-month-old program helps just a small
fraction of the 3,000 workers who gather on Los Angeles street
corners each day.
   The weak link, he says, are the employers.
   ``It's the employers who still go to pick up day laborers and a
lot of them are the unscrupulous employers who rip them off because
they know the men on the street are desperate,'' he said.
   But Molina and program planners in San Francisco say success is
not measured just by how many people find work each day.
   ``I think the intent is to provide a more secure place to look
for a job, where more protection will be given them, community
services will be given them, where contractors will be able to work
in a much more orderly way,'' said Mauricio Aviles, a spokesman for
the Mission Hiring Hall, one of the community groups working on the
San Francisco program.
   Chaos rules on street corners where job-seekers wait for
contractors.
   At the sight of a passing truck filled with lumber, clusters of
men rush into the street.
   Some reach for identification and green cards, hoping to gain an
advantage by their legal status. ``How many people do you need?''
they ask. ``What kind of work? How much do you pay?''
   Workers have agreed among themselves not to work for less than
$4.50 an hour, and for some jobs not less than $7 an hour, said
Lina Avidan of the Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and
Services.
   By mid-morning, fewer trucks pass and job prospects wane.
   ``How can 70 people get a job with 10 or 15 contractors a day?''
asks Jose Esparza, 21, who for the last 2{ months has been crowded
out in the hustle for jobs by new immigrants from Central and South
America.
   Before then, he worked an average of two days a week, said
Esparza, who came from Mexico when he was 11.
   Despite the pitfalls, many jobless, including Esparza, aren't
convinced that the hiring hall will actually get them more work.
   ``We are not too happy, but it's a good way to find jobs. It's
better than waiting in the employment office, in a 50-guy line, and
you get to the front and they say `We'll call you,''' said Esparza.
   ``Here, we work,'' he said.
   David Schermerhorn, a business agent at Warehouse Local 6 of the
International Longshoremen's &amp; Warehousemen's Union said he was
pleased to see the union tradition being applied to unskilled
workers.
   ``We certainly need it - I'm not saying the union - we need to
have something so the guys have some kind of organization,''
Schermerhorn said.
   ``I drive by every day just wondering what it would take to make
a connection with the guys and how to help them. I know they are
being abused and I haven't figured out how to help them.''

   Officials today finished searching the site of
a downtown construction site collapse and said no victims were
found.
   The sudden collapse forced evacuation of the adjacent building
that houses United Press International, swallowed several
construction trailers, part of an adjoining alley and a light pole.
Witnesses said the accident caused a bright explosion that lit the
night sky.
   ``We've completed the search, and we didn't find anyone, and
we've finished our part of the investigation,'' said District of
Columbia fire department spokesman Capt. Ted Holmes.
   Although fire officials said after an all-night search that they
doubted there were any victims in the rubble, they sent rescue
crews into the 60-foot site to check one construction trailer that
had been pitched into the hole.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps said the news service was able to
restore service quickly to its clients by switching some operations
to other bureaus. For example, he said, the Los Angeles bureau was
temporarily filing the agency's main domestic news wire.
   He said Reuters was helping UPI distribute photographs to its
customers and that National Public Radio was helping the news
agency maintain its broadcast and audio network services.
   He said it was his ``understanding that the building (housing
the news service) may have been undermined. I am told that the
alley way between the site and our building is virtually no more.''
   Officials also ordered dirt hauled to the site in an attempt to
secure it from further collapse.
   The collapse caused cracks in several adjoining streets and
forced police to cordon off a three-block area.
   Representatives from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration arrived at the scene early today to supervise the
investigation.
   The cause of the cave-in has not been determined, said another
fire department official, Battalion Chief Ambrose Murphy said. OSHA
inspectors were schedued to meet with engineers and consultants
this afternoon to discuss the accident.
   Three construction trailers and a van parked on the street
adjacent to the site tumbled into the cavity about four blocks from
the White House.
   Fire Chief Ray Alfred said an employee of the contractor told
firefighters he was the last person to leave the site and extensive
explorations during the night confirmed no one was trapped in the
hole.
   Subway service was closed at the station nearest the site Monday
night out of fear vibration from passing trains could make the
cave-in worse. Service at the station resumed today.
   The cave-in left several cracks on the street that serves as a
major commuter route between Washington and the heavily populated
northern Virginia suburbs. Murphy said several surrounding streets
would remain closed for several days.
   At UPI, Capps said some operations were switched to a UPI
computer center in suburban Virginia. Capps said editors and
writers would be working from press galleries in the U.S. Capitol
and, by laptop computer, from various locations around the city.
   He said he did not know how long it would take to make the
building safe for occupancy.

<HEAD>City Suspends Traffic Court Employees for Unpaid Tickets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Philly Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An assistant budget director for the city's
Traffic Court division has been suspended because of nearly $2,000
in unpaid traffic tickets dating back to 1984.
   According to court records, T. Milton Street owes $1,967 for 19
tickets. Violations included running a stop sign, reckless driving,
driving without a license and driving an unregistered vehicle.
   Street, a former Republican state senator, said he had no
intention of paying the fines and didn't have the money to do so.
   Street's son, T. Milton Street Jr., also was suspended from the
department. He owes $876 in fines on 11 outstanding traffic
citations, authorities said.
   Traffic court officials said neither Street is legally entitled
to drive.
   The Streets and five other department employees were suspended
without pay Monday by Traffic Court President Judge George Twardy.
The judge said he ordered a review of all 206 Traffic Court
employees for back tickets after learning of the elder Street's
unpaid tickets Friday from a newspaper report.
   Of the seven employees with unpaid traffic fines, the Streets
owed the most, the judge said.
   ``I think it's a disgrace. If our people here don't respond (to
traffic citations), what are the people on the street going to
do,'' Twardy said.
   Twardy said the suspended employees could pay their fines or
request hearings to contest them. But even if they resolve the
fines, their reinstatement is still subject to Twardy's approval.
   Street was hiring by the traffic court division last year at an
annual salary of $30,000.
   ``I believe that Judge Twardy wants to get rid of Milton Street
junior and senior and he directed a court supervisor to go through
old tickets and find anything in Milton Street's name,'' Street
said.
   He said the fight is really a disagreement over policy. He said
he disagrees with the requirement that poor people who want to
fight a ticket must post collateral first. Street said the practice
was discriminatory. Twardy said it's the law.

   There's not much humor left in the struggle
to keep the city afloat, but a bill for a non-urban item needed by
police horses brought mirth to officials deciding which bills could
be paid this week.
   ``Hay,'' said an aide to Finance Director Elizabeth C. Reveal,
revealing a lack of country experience, according to the
Philadelphia Daily News. ``That's almost like food for animals,
isn't it?''
   ``Yes, Joe, it's just like food,'' Ms. Reveal replied.
   She joined the group's chuckling, but the snickers ended
abruptly when she said: ``Pay it.''
   Ms. Reveal and six aides went through 931 new bills totaling
$12.5 million Monday and tagged $7 million for payment. Priority
went to spending for vital services, such as police, fire, foster
care, prisons and food - including hay.
   The remaining $5.5 million joined a longer list of expenses
deferred while the city tries to stave off insolvency.
   The deferred payments list has grown to 46 pages and includes
about 2,250 bills totaling $23 million and ranging from $25 to $1.7
million.

<HEAD>Burma Sentences Two Opposition Leaders to 10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers have sentenced
two opposition leaders to 10 years in jail, their toughest move yet
against the party that won May's general election, a political
source said Tuesday.
   In New York on Monday, the U.N. General Assembly took up a
resolution demanding that the government free its political
prisoners and expressed concern about its failure to hand power to
the National League for Democracy after its landslide poll victory.
   A military tribunal in Rangoon sentenced the league's Kyi Maung
and Chit Khaing on Monday, said the source, who was reached in the
Burmese capital from Bangkok and spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kyi Maung, 72, was the party's acting leader and a retired army
colonel. He was considered a moderate and a potential mediator
between the military and more radical opposition elements. Chit
Khaing, 69, was in charge of the league's publications.
   Most of the league's other leaders are behind bars.
   The source said it appeared the two were sentenced for violating
Burma's Official Secrets Act, an offense which carries a maximum
14-year term. The government detained them under the act on Sept.
6.
   Western diplomats said then it appeared they were accused of
passing to other league members a secret document given to them by
military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt.
   Kyi Maung and Chit Khaing were among the 392 league members who
won parliamentary seats in May.
   Political sources in Rangoon have reported the arrest of at
least 50 other members of the party since late October, including
about 15 members of parliament. The clampdown included raids on
Buddhist monasteries and the arrest of hundreds of monks.
   On Nov. 9, Maung Ko, 52, a leading league organizer, died in
military custody. Political sources said relatives believed he was
tortured to death. The prime minister, Gen. Saw Maung, said he
committed suicide.
   Amnesty International on Monday called attention to the torture
reports surrounding Maung Ko's death. It has cited numerous reports
of routine torture in custody.
   The London-based human rights group says the government has
detained many hundreds, perhaps thousands of opponents without
charge or trial or sentenced them to prison terms after unfair
military trials.
   It says at least 100 people have been sentenced to death,
although it was not clear if any of the sentences had been carried
out.
   The league's general secretary, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under
house arrest since July 1989, and its chairman, Tin Oo, was
sentenced to three-years jail last December.
   The draft U.N. resolution expresses concern over the failure of
the government to obey ``the will of the people'' by handing power
to the opposition.
   It was introduced by Sweden and co-sponsored by 20 countries -
the 12 European Community nations, and Australia, Canada, Austria,
Norway, Iceland, Poland, Sweden and Hungary. The General Assembly
will vote on it around Dec. 18.
   The draft also ``stresses its conviction ... that all citizens
detained with respect to their political activities ought to be
released immediately and restored to the full enjoyment to their
right to participate in the government of their country.''
   Saw Maung came to power in September 1988 as troops killed
thousands of people to crush a student-led uprising for democracy.
   Thousands of students fled the clampdown to neighboring
Thailand. Bangkok, which has close ties with Saw Maung's
government, recently hardened its attitude to the students after
two of them hijacked a Thai Airways flight on Nov. 10.
   On Tuesday an Interior Ministry official said United Nations and
other relief workers helping the Burmese students in Thailand must
get government approval for their programs or face fines or
imprisonment.
   Thailand classifies Burmese students as illegal immigrants.
Under its immigration law, anyone helping illegal immigrants faces
a $2,000 fine or five years in jail, the official said on condition
of anonymity.

<HEAD>Parliament Moves to Make Ruble Only Legal Currency in Soviet Union</HEAD>

   The weakening ruble would become the only legal
currency in the Soviet Union under legislation tentatively approved
Tuesday by one chamber of the national legislature.
   The official Tass news agency said the proposed law was aimed at
halting ``dollarization'' of the Soviet economy - the rapidly
growing use of U.S. dollars in both the official and underground
economies.
   Yuri Blokhin, a legislator who introduced the bill in the Soviet
legislature's Council of Nationalities, said a national currency
policy was necessary to boost the ruble's purchasing power.
   But it was unclear how the legislation, if enacted, would effect
the scores of joint-venture businesses now operating in the
country, or how it would fit into President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
plan to create a market economy.
   It was also uncertain how the law would be received by the
secessionist republics, such as the Baltic states, which have been
considering establishing their own currencies.
   To become law, the legislation requires approval by both
chambers of the Supreme Soviet parliament. No date was set for
further consideration.
   Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the government's Foreign
Economic Commission, acknowledged the bill was a temporary measure
that would have to be replaced once the ruble becomes convertible
on foreign exchange markets.
   Officials have said they intend to make the ruble convertible in
stages. They have not announced a timetable.
   Soviet citizens hold an estimated $324 million worth of foreign
currency, acquired mostly from tourists and work for foreign
companies.
   Ivanov said the law would let banks and Soviet citizens buy and
sell foreign currency only at stock exchanges and auctions at
market-determined rates. Current law requires all currency
transactions to be conducted through the government-run banking
system.
   Since Aug. 1, Soviets have been permitted to spend the foreign
currency at special stores without telling the government where
they got the money. Only certain Soviets are permitted to have
foreign currency bank accounts, such as those who have worked
abroad or for foreigners.
   Such stores range from government-run ``Beriozka'' stores
selling food, alcohol and luxury goods, to the foreign-owned
Christian Dior fashion outlet, two Western-style supermarkets and
two Pizza Hut restaurants. They accept only foreign cash or credit
cards.
   Ivanov said the legislation would prevent foreign currency from
being circulated as legal tender within the Soviet Union.
   Tourists can buy about 5.5 rubles for one dollar, but the black
market rate is closer to 20 rubles per dollar. For some
transactions, such as taxi rides, dollars or American cigarettes
are preferred to rubles.
   The government recently slashed by 70 percent the exchange rate
for international commercial transactions to spur exports and cut
imports. The rate since Nov. 1 has been 1.8 rubles per U.S. dollar,
compared with the previous rate of .56 rubles to the dollar.
   The demand for dollars has soared in recent years because
thousands of Soviets are taking advantage of newly relaxed border
controls to travel abroad for the first time.
   The government has its own huge foreign currency reserves, but
no official statistics exist on it and the law apparently would not
affect it.

   Home building plunged 6 percent in October,
the government said Tuesday, extending the longest construction
slide on record and sinking housing starts to their lowest level
since the 1981-82 recession.
   Industry observers pointed to shrinking consumer confidence and
the growing inability of builders to obtain credit as causes of the
nine-month decline, the longest since the government began keeping
track in 1959.
   Many believe the slide will continue into mid-1991, especially
in light of broader weakening in the U.S. economy.
   ``Consumers are scared to death,'' economist Martin Regalia of
the National Council of Savings Institutions said, echoing the
sentiments of many analysts. ``They're concerned about their
incomes.''
   ``Business confidence is just as bad,'' added Thomas Holloway,
an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``We're also
seeing the adverse impact of builders unable to get credit.''
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
in October fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.04
million units. That was lowest level since construction of 902,000
units began in June 1982.
   ``The details of the October housing starts statistics indicate
that the industry's condition is even more dire than had been
thought,'' said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette, a New York securities firm.
   She noted that applications for building permits fell 6.8
percent to 925,000, the lowest level since 913,000 applications
were filed in June 1982, ``indicating that a rebound in starts is
not foreseeable in the immediate future.'' Building permits are
often a barometer of future activity.
   Construction of single-family units dropped 1.0 percent to
854,000 units, a level Regalia said was approaching ``recessionary
levels, which are the low 700,000s.''
   But for Dan Pincus, a builder in Brick, N.J., ``it's almost
better to admit we're in a recession so we can start talking about
how to get out of it.''
   ``Customers are just running into holes,'' Pincus said, forcing
his firm to lay off most of its workers and cancel projects. The
crews that remain and his suppliers and subcontractors are being
asked to wait for payment until his houses are sold.
   ``My cash flow has been stretched to the limit,'' he said.
``We're down to building one house now, where we would have had
three or four previously.''
   The construction industry has lost 185,000 construction jobs
nationally in the last five months, including 80,000 in October,
the Labor Department reported recently.
   Analysts also point out that declining construction often means
declining sales of appliances, furniture and other home furnishings
as well as building supplies.
   Construction of multi-family units such as apartments and
condominiums plummeted 23.3 percent to 187,000 units after a 17.3
percent drop in September.
   Analysts point to high vacancy rates in many areas of the
country, which make builders hesitant to begin new projects and
lenders reluctant to make new money available.
   ``The vacancy rates, the overbuilding have left us with
inventories that suggest this weakness will continue,'' Regalia
said.
   In addition, some contractors are waiting for the government to
issue regulations designed to make apartments more accessible to
the handicapped before committing themselves to new projects.
   Starts in the Northeast, scene of some of the slowest housing
activity recently, shot up 38.5 percent to 144,000 units. But
starts were down elsewhere - 16.9 percent to 266,000 units in the
West, 10.4 percent to 395,000 units in the South and 2.5 percent to
236,000 units in the Midwest.

   Dan, Peter, Tom, Ted and Sam are

Juice has just arrived for Thanksgiving football.
   They are part a multinational force invading Saudi Arabia. No,
it's not a military exercise for Operation Desert Shield. It's an
influx of media, soon to be joined by White House reinforcements
for Thanksgiving Day.
   As of Tuesday, 517 journalists had registered with the Joint
Information Bureau, the media center run by the American military
and the Saudi government. Since Operation Desert Shield was
deployed in August, more than 1,200 journalists have signed on.
   More than 300 are flying with President Bush, due to meet and
greet the troops on Thursday.
   From ABC to the Voice of America, from the American Spectator to
the Wall Street Journal, reporters are combing the sands. There's a
veritable cornucopia of alphabets: CBS, NBC, CNN, BBC, ITN and
PAOs, which is militaryspeak for public affairs officers, whose job
is to escort the media.
   It's not just an American show. There are reporters from
Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Brazil
and Egypt, among others.
   Nobody is making a bigger splash than ABC, which has nearly 50
people on the Joint Information Bureau registry. The network is
running five shows out of Saudi Arabia, including its nightly news
program with Peter Jennings.
   Dan Rather of CBS and Tom Brokaw of NBC fill out the anchor
spots, while CNN has a current crew of 19.
   ``It's been a major commitment on our part. We've earned our
stripes,'' said Jim Miller, who heads CNN's operations in Saudi
Arabia.
   Willard Scott of NBC's ``Today'' show broadcast live all last
week, and Bryant Gumbel was here earlier. Former football star O.J.
``The Juice'' Simpson arrived Tuesday and will appear with U.S.
Marines on Thursday's NBC program that precedes pro football.
   The onslaught has turned the miniature golf course and a garage
roof of the main media hotel into ``Satellite Alley'' because so
many of the dishes are bouncing signals off orbiting electronic
stations.
   Nearby is a carpeted and air conditioned tent that will serve as
the White House media center. Joint Information Bureau officials
have told some PAOs they will be so busy that they should postpone
their turkey dinners for a day.
   The media glare is a bit bewildering to the Saudis, whose
Islamic kingdom has never before been under such scrutiny.
   The government has entertained heads of state and accompanying
reporters, and hundreds of Moslem reporters come to Saudi Arabia
each year to cover the pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina.
   But there has been nothing like this, and requests for
additional visas by American newspapers and organizations run in
the thousands, according to Mohamed Khayat of the Ministry of
Information.
   Some of those awaiting admission may be disappointed, and others
may only get visas good for two to four days.
   ``Friendly countries have sent their children here to defend
Saudi Arabia, and they want to get news about their children. We
understand this,'' Khayat said.
   ``There is no limit. But we think the number is sufficient. It
covers the major media organizations,'' he said.
   Privately, Saudi officials are edgy over the number of
journalists. One government official who asked not to be identified
said no more visas would be issued at least until Bush and the
White House press corps are long gone.
   Another official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
restrictions were imposed on new visas because of reports about a
protest in which Saudi women drove their own cars.
   Women sent to cover the story must observe some restrictions
imposed on Saudi women - like the driving ban - but it hasn't
stopped them from working.
   Women now represent the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Wall
Street Journal, Philadelphia Inquirer, National Public Radio, Voice
of America, Dallas Morning News, New York Newsday, Associated Press
and all the U.S. television networks.
   Transportation can be a problem for women reporters if military
escorts aren't available.
   Molly Moore of The Washington Post said she spent about $200 for
a cab to take her to a military base and wait for her for six
hours.
   ``The biggest headache for me is not being able to drive or rent
a car. I've spent a fortune in cab fares. But other than driving,
they haven't stopped me from anything I wanted to do,'' Ms. Moore
said.

   The Iraqi parliament, acting at the behest
of President Saddam Hussein, voted tonight to free all the
remaining Germans held in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Parliament speaker Saadi Mahdi Saleh said there were 124 Germans
still in Iraq and Kuwait. No specific arrangements were made for
their departure, and there was no indication when they would be
freed.
   It was not known how many member of the 250-member National
Assembly attended the session to consider Saddam's request. Only
one lawmaker, Jamil Sheik Issa, voted against the measure.
   Earlier this week Saddam said all foreigners would be allowed to
leave between Dec. 25 and March 25, but Information Minister Latif
Nassiyif Jassim indicated Monday that some might be allowed to
leave earlier.
   Earlier reports said there were about 280 Germans in Iraq and
Kuwait, with some held at strategic sites to ward off a possible
attack by the U.S.-led multinational force. The vote today referred
to 124 Germans, and there was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   Hundreds of foreigners have been prevented from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait since Iraq seized the emirate Aug. 2.
   Saddam told delegations from France and Switzerland on Monday
that more Europeans would be allowed to go free, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   The report today on the meetings with a five-member Swiss
parliamentary delegation headed by Christian Democrat opposition
member Edgar Oehler and by French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen did
not say how many Europeans would be released or when they would be
allowed to leave.
   On Monday, Iraq announced an unspecified number of Swiss would
be allowed to leave ``in appreciation'' of the Swiss delegation's
visit to Baghdad.
   INA said Saddam told both delegations that dialogue should be
used to solve the Persian Gulf conflict.
   ``As human beings, we are flexible in our way of thinking and
behavior, but on the basis of the right path, humanitarian
relationship and dialogue, not threats,'' the president said.
   Saddam again accused the United States of seeking to control the
world's oil reserves. He also repeated his Aug. 12 statement that
all the region's problems were linked to a solution of the
Palestinian problem.
   The United States and its allies have said Saddam's attempt to
absorb Kuwait should not be linked to the Palestinian-Israeli
dispute.
   Concerning the German hostages, Saddam said a recent statement
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl calling for a peaceful solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis, as well as the historic friendship between the
two peoples, prompted his decision.
   The Western allies have accused Saddam of trying to use the
hostage issue to try to split the alliance against him. In
releasing the Germans, the Iraqi president contrasted Bonn's
attitude with that of Washington and London.
   ``The decision of banning some foreigners from travel was
adopted on the hope of giving reckless minds in the administration
of (President) Bush and (British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher
an opportunity to delay in carrying on the procedure toward the
abyss of evil,'' INA quoted him as saying.
   Saddam allowed 120 Germans to leave with former West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt earlier this month.
   The call to the assembly to free the hostages, referred to in
Iraq as ``guests,'' was the same procedure used to free hundreds of
French and Bulgarian hostages.
   Iraq announced Monday that 250,000 more troops were being sent
to Kuwait - Saddam's answer to Bush's announcement Nov. 8 that up
to 200,000 more U.S. troops will be sent to the gulf.
   Also Monday, Information Minister Jassim declined to say if
something short of an attack, such as passage of a U.N. resolution
authorizing offensives, would be enough to disrupt the planned
hostage releases.
   ``We are watching the situation,'' said Jassim when asked if
such a resolution would block the plan.
   At a news conference, Jassim declined to guarantee that
Westerners in Kuwait could emerge from hiding without risking
arrest and relocation to a potential military target. Five Germans
and two Americans were reported arrested Saturday in Kuwait.
   ``This is a procedural thing that is not related to the
political attitude,'' said Jassim. ``Every foreigner should report
to Iraqi authorities so they can be registered and protected by
Iraqi authorities. This is a matter of rules and regulations.''

   A member of Congress criticized the
Agriculture Department Tuesday for extending billions of dollars in
loan guarantees to Iraq for food from American farmers throughout
the 1980s.
   ``Today, the U.S. is pledging to make war on Iraq,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``For the last seven years, though, we
pledged the same country free credit.''
   Schumer released a General Accounting Office report that says
USDA continued to approve credit guarantees ``even though
Agriculture's risk analysis documents for fiscal years 1989 and
1990 rated Iraq as a high-risk market.''
   ``It seems that the U.S. desire to build a strategic and
agricultural trade relationship with Iraq outweighed the apparent
financial risks involved and discounted evidence of Iraq's human
rights violations,'' the report said.
   Schumer, chairman of the task force on urgent fiscal issues for
the House Budget Committee, requested the GAO study. He is a
long-time foe of federal spending on agriculture programs.
   Export guarantees for Iraq's purchases totaled $4.9 billion from
1983 to 1989. Another $500 million was approved in 1990.
   When President Bush announced the trade embargo after Iraq's
Aug. 1 invasion of Kuwait, a total $2 billion in debts remained.
   Under the terms of the loan guarantee program, the federal
government must pay the banks that extended the credit to Iraq if
Iraq doesn't meet its debts.
   The Agriculture Department has confirmed that private banks have
begun asking it to make good on the credit guarantees, which were
used to buy wheat, rice and other commodities.
   Not all of the $2 billion is due at once. The loans are spread
out, some of them running through 1995 or later.
   No money is lent directly by the department. Once a country is
approved for the guarantee, private lenders and exporters work out
a plan with the foreign buyer, subject to USDA approval.
   Larry McElvain, director of USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. for
the Foreign Agricultural Service, said the government didn't start
getting claims on Iraqi loans until the trade embargo began.

   Saddam Hussein put his key pawns in the Persian Gulf crisis back
into play again today by asking parliament to free all Germans held
hostage in Iraq. The National Assembly quickly agreed.
   The move came a day after Saddam ordered the deployment of
250,000 more troops into Kuwait. Their deployment would boost the
number of Iraqi soldiers in the oil-rich emirate to about 430,000.
   There was only one dissenting vote when the National Assembly
met late today and voted to allow all Germans to leave Iraq and
Kuwait. No specific arrangements were made for the Germans'
departure.
   Parliament speaker Saadi Mahdi Saleh said there were 124 Germans
in Iraq and Kuwait - a number far below the estimated 280 Germans
reported earlier. There was no explanation of the discrepancy.
   Saddam told delegations from France and Switzerland on Monday
that more Europeans would be allowed to go free, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported. And a Dutch company reported today that 105
Dutchmen, 14 Belgians and 3 Britons who completed a
government-commissioned dredging project also will be allowed to
depart.
   Hundreds of foreigners have been prevented from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait since Saddam's troops overran the emirate Aug. 2, and the
Western allies have accused Saddam of trying to use the hostage
issue to try to split the alliance against him.
   In releasing the Germans, the Iraqi president contrasted the
German government's attitude with that of Washington and London.
   ``The decision of banning some foreigners from travel was
adopted on the hope of giving reckless minds in the administration
of (President) Bush and (British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher
an opportunity to delay in carrying on the procedure toward the
abyss of evil,'' INA quoted him as saying.
   Saddam allowed 120 Germans to leave with former West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt earlier this month.
   Saddam's troop buildup was a clear response to Bush's
announcement Nov. 8 that up to 200,000 more troops would be sent to
the gulf, giving the U.S.-led multinational force an offensive
military option and bringing the number of U.S. troops in the
region to about 430,000.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' today that the United States
would closely monitor troop movements.
   ``It seems to me this is part of Saddam Hussein's
headline-of-the-day program. Yesterday it was troop buildup, the
day before that it was a hostage release,'' Powell said. ``What
he's trying to do is take the world's eye off the ball. And that
ball is his aggression against the nation of Kuwait, his aggression
in the region, his threatening our economic lifeline.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the announcement
of Iraq's new deployment ``another instance of him (Saddam)
thumbing his nose at the United Nations.'' The U.N. Security
Council has passed 10 resolutions - including a trade embargo - in
an effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   In Baghdad, there was another sign today that the trade embargo
is having an impact. The state press said the country's legislature
had voted to impose the death penalty on anyone hoarding wheat,
barley, rice, corn and other grains for trading purposes.
   Indian news reports said today that Iraq is refusing to allow an
Indian ship, its crew and 14 Red Cross workers to leave until it
unloads more than 4,700 tons of rice. The ship docked at the Iraqi
port of Umm Qasr in September with 10,000 tons of food for Indians
in Iraq and Kuwait. It had been scheduled to leave with some of its
cargo.
   On Monday, President Bush failed to get Soviet agreement on a
proposed U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev went so far only as to agree that force in the
gulf ``cannot be ruled out,'' officials said.
   Bush met with Gorbachev in Paris, attending a summit that
included the signing Monday of an arms reduction treaty by NATO and
Warsaw Pact members.
   His secretary of state, James A. Baker III, has been pressing
hard in meetings with foreign ministers for a U.N. resolution
authorizing an attack to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Bush focused in large part on the issue in a dinner with the
Soviet president.
   Later, Fitzwater tried to minimize differences between the two
leaders on the use of force, saying: ``We are united on this issue.
We have a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out.''
   A poll published today, meanwhile, indicated Americans are
increasingly worried that Bush favors the military option over the
diplomatic route to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In the joint New York Times-CBS poll, 47 percent of respondents
said the Bush administration has been too quick to get U.S. forces
involved and has not been diligent enough about seeking diplomatic
solutions.
   Only 38 percent felt the same way in August, the poll said.
   The poll of 1,370 adults was done by telephone Nov. 13-15. It
has a margin for error of 3 percent.

   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Tuesday
took a grim inventory of the Soviet pantry for the winter and
warned that ``almost everywhere, supplies are worse than last
year.''
   Although it predicted there would be no ``real hunger'' in the
coming months, Pravda said the food that Russians traditionally
count on, such as cabbage and beets, will be in short supply.
   ```Cabbage soup and porridge is our food.' It's a famous Russian
proverb. It appears that now we can't even get this humble
portion,'' Pravda correspondent A. Platoshkin wrote.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak on Monday made a public appeal
to the West for emergency food aid for his city, the second-largest
in the Soviet Union, to avoid famine and discontent with the reform
movement.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is lining up Western aid for
his nation during his current trip abroad, admitted in a speech to
the national legislature Friday that the country faces critical
shortages at the start of winter but insisted the government has
enough supplies.
   The Pravda correspondent said he agreed with Gorbachev's
assessment that there were adequate reserves, although he also
wrote that ``what's in storage doesn't mean it makes it to the
table.''
   Pravda said there should be enough bread for the nation after
the government bought 66 million tons of grain, which is more than
last year.
   But vegetables, potatoes and other foods were in short supply.
   The reason for the shortages, according to Pravda, is that
enterprises in the various republics are disobeying orders from the
central government to fulfill their quotas.
   As the Soviet republics push for local control over their
economies, political structures and culture, they are disregarding
orders from the central government. This has caused the ``paralysis
of power'' that has stalled Gorbachev's reforms and led him on
Saturday to propose restructuring the executive branch of
government and put it entirely under his control.
   He said Saturday an emergency program would be drafted within
two weeks to try to solve the country's food shortage.
   In the vast Russian republic, which has more than half the
country's population, the potato supply is little more than half of
what is needed, Pravda reported.
   Potatoes are known as the ``second bread'' because of their
importance in the Russian diet.
   ``Sometimes ... it was our first and last bread,'' Platoshkin
wrote. ``It could be called our national love. We devote many
proverbs and songs to potatoes.
   ``But maybe, at the present moment, we're going to have to play
a funeral dirge,'' he said, noting that the many potatoes stored in
dirty, damp cellars will rot before the winter is out.
   The article did not address the potato needs for Moscow, where
citizens and soldiers helped gather this autumn's potato crop
following heavy rains that hindered the harvest.
   Pravda said there also were shortages of other basic foods:
fresh and sour cabbage, carrots, beets, tomatoes and the Russian
favorite, pickled onions.
   Only garlic was in oversupply, it said.
   In the Ural Mountains cities of Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk and
Tyumen, there is an critical shortage of meat and dairy products,
Pravda said.
   At Sobchak's urging, Leningrad's City Council voted last week to
begin rationing meat, poultry, eggs, flour, butter and other
staples starting Dec. 1. Many other cities throughout Russia and
the Ukraine already ration food, sugar, vodka, matches, soap and
other necessities.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Sobchak said some
people in Leningrad had accused him of being too proud to ask for
help, but that for the good of the city, he would ``get down on my
knees'' if necessary.
   Sobchak, a member of the Supreme Soviet legislature, is the
first high-level Soviet official to appeal publicly for food
donations from the West. He said the West German government and a
private U.S. organization, AmeriCares, already were preparing
shipments.
   ``A month ago, I thought we could avoid foreign aid. Today, I
think we can't,'' he said. ``The food situation has worsened, and
by the time we take steps to increase stockpiles and improve
distribution, we could already have placed our major cities ... in
danger of famine.''

   Elizabeth Taylor says her doctors were
blunt with her when she was hospitalized earlier this year with a
near-fatal case of pneumonia.
   ``They told me that I was dying,'' Miss Taylor said in a USA
Today interview published Tuesday. ``They said it in front of my
sons, too.''
   Miss Taylor, 58, was first hospitalized at Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital on April 9 with what was described as a sinus infection.
But her condition worsened and she was transferred to St. John's in
serious condition with viral pneumonia.
   She was placed on a respirator and intravenous medication and
doctors said she was near death on April 22. Miss Taylor rallied,
however, and she was released in June.
   Miss Taylor offered a candid account of her hospital stay.
   ``Oh, sweetheart, I had so much machinery coming out of my
throat, my nose, my neck, it was like science fiction,'' she said.
``Colorful, too .... with the tubes, you can see pieces of yourself
floating by. Very gross Technicolor!''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Axl Rose, the tattooed lead singer of the
heavy metal band Guns 'N Roses, is seeking a restraining order
against a woman he allegedly struck with a wine bottle last month
in a scuffle at his home.
   Rose, 28, asked a Superior Court judge Monday to prohibit his
neighbor, Gabriela Kantor, from having any contact with him, his
wife, Erin, or any visitors to their West Hollywood condominium.
   Rose was arrested Oct. 30 for investigation of assault after he
allegedly struck Ms. Kantor on the head with a wine bottle in the
hallway outside his home after she complained about his loud music.
   The rock star was released on $5,000 bail after being jailed for
four hours. Ms. Kantor was treated at a hospital.
   Prosecutors will decide by Nov. 29 whether to file criminal
charges against Rose, said Mike Botula, a spokesman in the district
attorney's office.
   Rose filed documents Monday that contended the Oct. 30 incident
began with Ms. Kantor ``banging incessantly and hysterically'' on
Rose's door.
   She then allegedly ``threatened to stab, injure and kill'' the
singer with the wine bottle, according to the petition for a
temporary restraining order.
   Ms. Kantor does not have a telephone listing in West Hollywood
and could not be reached for comment.

   A 12-year-old boy who was severely burned when
he refused his attacker's demand that he take drugs will get a
special award from the American Sportscasters Association next
week.
   David Opont will receive the ``Hero of the Year'' award from
Vice President Quayle at the sportscasters' dinner in New York,
organizers said.
   ``David Opont is a symbol of bravery and courage that our young
people can look to with pride,'' said Louis O. Schwartz, president
of the association.
   Opont was burned over 50 percent of his body in the attack in
March. After several skin grafts, he was released from the hospital
in August.
   His attacker was convicted of attempted murder for tying up
Opont and setting him on fire. The 14-year-old defendant also was
found guilty last month of kidnapping, robbery and other offenses.
   Under juvenile law, the defendant, who was not identified
because of his age, can be confined to a detention center for three
years, but the sentence can be extended each year afterward until
he is 21.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The widow of baseball great Jackie Robinson, one
of the founders of the recently defunct Freedom National Bank, says
her husband ``would have been devastated'' by the bank's recent
closure.
   ``Being chairman and founder of Freedom was one of the major
achievements of his post-baseball career,'' Rachel Robinson said in
an interview published Tuesday in the New York Post. ``He loved the
bank, and worried about it a lot.''
   Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier in 1947, formed the
Harlem-based bank in 1964 with others to help residents and small
minority-owned businesses obtain mortgages and loans.
   Freedom, the nation's fourth-largest black-owned bank, lost $4
million over the last two years before being closed by federal
regulators on Nov. 13.
   ``Freedom Bank, as we know it, has no future. That bank has been
terminated. We should not be talking in terms of reviving Freedom.
We have lost that bank and that opportunity,'' said Mrs. Robinson,
who became a member of the bank's board of directors in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Nothing was so memorable about Michael Heseltine's
years in the Cabinet as his departure.
   He resigned in the middle of a meeting in January 1986, walked
out of the prime minister's residence, told reporters he had quit,
and walked down Downing Street alone.
   The videotape of Heseltine's exit has been shown repeatedly on
British television, every time some ruckus in the Conservative
Party hinted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's position was in
jeopardy.
   Just as often, Heseltine would say - as he said as recently as
Nov. 6 - that he could not foresee the circumstances in which he
would challenge her. Eight days later he changed his mind and
launched the most serious political challenge to Mrs. Thatcher in
her 11{ years in power.
   On Tuesday, he forced Mrs. Thatcher into a second-round ballot
to determine the party leadership - and that of the nation.
   Tall and handsome with flowing blond hair and piercing blue
eyes, the 57-year-old Heseltine is a self-made millionaire who
doesn't quite fit any faction of the governing Conservative Party.
   Critics accuse him of volatility and showmanship. As his
challenge to her leadership loomed, Thatcher aides commented: ``all
glamour and no substance.''
   The most famous story about Heseltine dates from his days at
Oxford University, when he is said to have sketched his future,
decade by decade, on the back of an envelope.
   According to his unofficial biographer and fellow Conservative
lawmaker, Julian Critchley, Heseltine marked down his goal for the
1990s: ``Downing Street.''
   As he finally made his move for the prime minister's office and
the tenancy of 10 Downing St., Heseltine denied the story of the
back of the envelope. But his ambition, nurtured for years in
political exile, has not been disguised.
   He is a politician with a flair for the dramatic gesture, and
the patience to wait for the prime minister to stumble.
   Critchley, an admirer but no longer a close friend, describes
Heseltine as ``95 percent calculation and 5 percent Celt,'' a
reference to Heseltine's passion and his birth in Wales.
   As defense secretary from 1983 to 1986 at the height of the
propaganda battle over the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles in
Britain, Heseltine donned a flak jacket for a confrontation with
anti-nuclear protesters at a missile base.
   Politically, he's dead center in the party while Mrs. Thatcher
stands well to the right. But many on the Tory left distrust him
for views that include an enthusiastic advocacy of a U.S. program
that requires the unemployed to work for welfare.
   He calls his political philosophy ``caring capitalism,'' which
contrasts with the robust, self-made stance of Thatcherism.
   ``I find it difficult to reconcile with what I understand to be
the core of Tory philosophy that there are people sleeping in the
doorways of so many central London streets,'' Heseltine said in a
recent interview with The Independent on Sunday.
   Mrs. Thatcher attacked him for his economic views, which she
said smacked of the policies of the socialist Labor Party and of
the Soviet Union.
   Heseltine was environmental secretary in Mrs. Thatcher's first
Cabinet, the golden boy who seemed destined for bigger things. In
1983, he became secretary of defense.
   The rift came in 1986 in a dispute over the acquisition of the
financially troubled British helicopter-maker Westland PLC.
Heseltine, always pro-European, favored a European consortium while
Mrs. Thatcher favored a U.S. corporation, Sikorsky.
   The feud culminated in Heseltine's walkout from a Cabinet
meeting.
   Heseltine then conducted a patient campaign of a leader in
waiting. He has swept round the country addressing party meetings,
spreading good will and glamour and assiduously avoiding direct
criticism of Mrs. Thatcher.
   Subtle criticisms, however, were always there, particularly
about her combative stance against the rest of the European
Community and a controversial new local government tax, the
so-called poll tax.
   Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine was born March 21, 1933, into a
middle-class Welsh family. His father was a structural engineer.
   Starting with $2,000 from his grandfather, he made one fortune
in property and then another in magazine publishing.
   He and his wife, Anne, who have two daughters and a son, have a
magnificent house in London's Belgravia district and a country
mansion where he has planted 2,500 species of trees and shrubs. It
also has a lake for his lifelong hobby of birdwatching.
   ``I haven't been driven by money,'' Heseltine once said. ``I saw
money as an important part of the process of being independent -
and in enabling me to pursue a political career.''

   A judge on Tuesday refused bail to the
son of Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, saying Robert Jeffrey
Lujan, who was arrested on a rape charge, was ``an unreasonable
danger'' to the community.
   Circuit Court Judge Donald M. Haddock rejected an appeal from
Lujan's attorney who argued that the young man was not a threat to
flee and had no history of violent behavior.
   Lujan's attorney, Robert Powell, said he would take the case to
the Virginia Court of Appeals.
   Lujan, 28, was arrested Wednesday and held without bail on
charges of raping a woman resident of the same apartment building
where Lujan lives with his parents.
   The 48-year-old woman testified she awoke to find Lujan - naked
and armed with a shotgun - sitting on her bed.
   Powell has said Lujan has admitted spending several hours in the
woman's apartment, but added the woman invited him to the apartment
and that the sexual relations were consentual.
   Manuel Lujan said after the arrest that his son, who had a
federal felony drug conviction in 1983, has a severe drinking
problem.

   The Milli Vanilli duo said today they made a
``pact with the devil'' when they pretended they sang on a hit
album, and they contended it was all with the knowledge of their
record company.
   ``We were scared. People threatened us,'' said Milli Vanilli
member Rob Pilatus at a news conference today. ``(But) we're happy
that it's over.''
   Pilatus declined to say who threatened him and partner Fabrice
Morvan. But he said Arista Records President Clive Davis knew about
the deception that has rocked the pop music industry. Arista has
denied the allegation.
   ``Arista Records and their executives did not know that Rob
Pilatus and Fab Morvan did not sing on the Milli Vanilli album, and
any assertions to the contrary are false and libelous,'' the
company said in a statement today.
   Milli Vanilla was stripped of its Grammy on Monday, the first
act forced to return a Grammy in the 34-year history of the award.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences rescinded the
1989 best new artist Grammy, one day before the two planned to
surrender the honor.
   Pilatus said the album gave them fame and fortune, but it came
at a high cost. He said they were seduced by the money and success
because they were poor and living in a Munich housing project.
   ``You get something, for that you make a pact with the devil,''
said Pilatus.
   Goaded by the media to prove they could sing, Pilatus cursed and
said, ``I'll do it.'' The two then burst into a few lines from the
song ``Girl, You Know It's True'' from their the best-selling album
by the same name.
   The duo admitted last week that they did not sing a note on the
album. They also lip-synced at concerts and on the Grammy awards
show in February. The album sold about 7 million copies.
   Pilatus, 25, from Germany, and Morvan, also 25 and a native of
the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe, were stripped of its best new
artist Grammy Award following revelations that other singers
substituted for the pop duo on ``Girl, You Know It's True.''
   ``This is the first time this has ever happened'' in Grammy
history, academy president Michael Greene said. ``I do think it's
an isolated incident. We are as upset about it as the public has
the right to be.''
   Greene said academy trustees voted overwhelmingly to take back
the award. A decision on what to do with it will be made by an
academy subcommittee Dec. 5.
   Greene said the duo's wish that it be given to the three singers
who actually sang was ``not a possibility.''
   The academy recognizes ``packaging'' groups is part of the music
industry, Greene said. But misleading record labels are
unacceptable, he said. The album label ``said `Vocals: Rob and
Fab.' That was just absolutely false,'' he said.
   Milli Vanilli's German producer, Frank Farian, who disclosed the
deception, said in a statement that by returning the Grammy, ``Rob
and Fab can put this episode behind them and mark the beginning of
a new career for themselves.''
   Vocalists Johnny Davis, Charles Shaw and Brad Howell reportedly
were the real singers.
   ``I'm very pleased that it's coming out. ... I'm pleased that
they are taking action in America,'' Shaw said on Monday's
``Entertainment Tonight.''
   Shaw said he earlier tried to persuade people he was one of the
singers, but getting anyone to believe him ``was like running my
head into a brick wall.''
   Meanwhile, an Oakland woman who bought her son a Milli Vanilli
tape filed a class action lawsuit in state court Monday seeking a
refund for anyone in California who bought the group's recordings
or attended one of their concerts.
   ``I want everyone to be able to get money back. I don't want the
producer in Germany to profit from what he did to these kids,''
Sheila Stalder said.
   The lawsuit also seeks to recover profits and place them in a
trust benefiting consumer groups as outlined in the state's
consumer protection law, said Stalder's lawyer, Alan Caplan.

<HEAD>Pentagon Shows Little Worry Over New Iraqi Troop Buildup</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-Iraq, Bjt</HEAD>

   The Pentagon said Tuesday that Iraq's
announced plan to send 250,000 more troops to Kuwait may be only a
psychological ploy, but left open the possibility that even more
American GIs could be deployed in response.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
that because new Iraqi reinforcements may lack adequate training
and supplies, their deployment to Kuwait could hurt rather than
help Saddam Hussein's war-making ability.
   ``It's not clear that large numbers of additional, probably less
capable units significantly adds to his combat power in theater;
and in fact, might present him with new vulnerabilities rather than
added strength,'' Powell said.
   Meanwhile, 45 House Democrats filed suit in U.S. District Court
seeking an injunction to prevent President Bush from ordering a
military attack on Iraqi forces in Kuwait without first getting a
go-ahead from Congress.
   The issue should be debated in Congress because ``there are
millions of American people in this country who have serious
questions about going to war,'' said Rep. Ronald V. Dellums,
D-Calif., who organized the lawsuit. ``The president of the United
States on his own cannot make that kind of determination.''
   At the Pentagon, chief spokesman Pete Williams said officials
hadn't seen the lawsuit. In response to reporters' questions, he
added that Congress has been kept fully abreast of U.S. military
actions in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Members of Congress have been informed, consulted, met with,
briefed by (the Pentagon and the White House) ... on every aspect
of this operation so far,'' Williams said.
   On Monday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported that Saddam
had decided to form seven additional army divisions and call up
more than 150,000 reservists for active duty, ``adding to our
forces over a quarter of a million fighters.''
   Iraq already has about 430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern
Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates, facing off in the gulf area
against 230,000 American troop and at least 100,000 others sent by
U.S. allies and other Arab nations.
   Two weeks ago, Bush announced plans to send U.S. reinforcements
to the gulf that are expected to increase the American force to
about 430,000 by January.
   In an interview today with ``CBS This Morning,'' Powell said he
doubted that Bush would answer Saddam tit-for-tat with still more
troop deployments. The chairman said the latest Iraqi buildup plan
may simply put fresh troops in Kuwait to replace rather than to
reinforce those that have been there since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Williams, however, stressed that it was too early to know
whether Saddam's latest announcement would require a U.S. response
of additional troop deployments, but he said a further Iraqi
buildup could be a reason to send more American troops.
   An increase in Iraqi forces in Kuwait, from about 165,000 in
early September to 430,000 in October, was a key reason cited by
the Pentagon for Bush's decision earlier this month to send in a
new wave of U.S. reinforcements.
   Williams said U.S. military authorities would be monitoring
Iraqi troop movements for evidence of a buildup. He said there was
not yet any such evidence.
   ``It's hard to know whether this is something Iraq intends to do
or whether this is just a propaganda ploy to get the attention off
its occupation of Kuwait and the hostages,'' Williams said.
   ``If Iraq does follow through on this announcement, it would be
a further tightening of its grip on occupied Kuwait, just the
opposite of what the world has asked Iraq to do, which is to
withdraw from Kuwait,'' the spokesman said.
   Williams declined to comment on Powell's remark that additional
Iraqi troops in Kuwait could give Saddam ``new vulnerabilities,''
although Williams said the deployments could make it harder for
Saddam to defend Iraqi territory in the event of a U.S. offensive.

<HEAD>Baltic Officials Protest Exclusion From Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of the three Baltic republics
protested Tuesday at the Soviet move excluding them from the work
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   They urged participants to help them gain a ``full and
complete'' role in the 34-nation summit.
   At a news conference organized by Denmark and Iceland, the three
praised France for its efforts.
   Through a French invitation, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were
able to take part Monday in the opening ceremonies of the three-day
summit meeting of 34 leaders.
   However, their hoped-for participation in summit work was cut
short by the Soviet refusal to allow them status as independent
states.
   Lithuanian Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas, in a statement
signed by his delegation, said, ``Monday afternoon we were informed
that our accreditation was no longer valid because of the Soviet
veto.''
   Because CSCE decisions are made by consensus, the Soviet refusal
to allow the Baltic representatives to participate was final.
   The three ministers said the Soviet move rejecting their
participation as independent states counters principles of the
Helsinki accords. They said a growing number of countries supported
``complete and total'' participation of the Baltic nations in the
CSCE process.
   Estonian Foreign Minister Lennart Meri listed nations supporting
Baltic participation in the CSCE process as: France, Denmark,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Britain.

   Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine today
forced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher into a second-round ballot
in their struggle for leadership of the Conservative Party.
   The close vote was a sharp setback to Mrs. Thatcher, who has
governed Britain for 11{ years. She won 204 votes from party
members of the House of Commons and Heseltine received 152 votes.
If she had received two more votes from the 16 members who
abstained, she would have won on the first ballot.
   If Mrs. Thatcher loses the leadership of the party, she would
step down as prime minister.
   ``I confirm it is my intention to let my name go forward to the
second ballot,'' a calm Mrs. Thatcher told reporters outside the
British Embassy in Paris.
   t was expected, however, that some of her supporters would urge
her to step down rather than risk a humiliating defeat.
   The opposition Labor Party compounded the political turmoil by
tabling a motion of no confidence in the government. That motion,
which likely would be debated before the second ballot in the
leadership contest, could bring down the government and force a
national election.
   ``Whatever the outcome of the current election in the
Conservative Party, a substantial proportion of that party will
continue to have no confidence in whatever leader is chosen,''
Labor leader Neil Kinnock said.
   A smiling Heseltine greeted reporters outside his home. ``I am
overwhelmed with gratitude to my parliamentary colleagues who in
such large measure have given me their support,'' said Heseltine,
who stood hand-in-hand with his wife, Anne, outside their home.
   ``It is the end for her,'' said Conservative lawmaker Robert
Rhodes James.
   The 204 votes gave Mrs. Thatcher a lead of 14.6 percent, when
she needed a 15 percent advantage to win outright.
   In the second ballot, on Nov. 27, a simple majority would be
sufficient to win. However, other candidates would be free to step
forward. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has indicated he might run
against Heseltine if Mrs. Thatcher dropped out.
   The prime minister learned of the result in Paris, where she was
attending the 34-nation summit on European security.
   Mrs. Thatcher had been at pains to keep up business as usual
earlier today - although the business last weekend included a round
of lengthy interviews with newspapers about the leadership
challenge.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, had argued that Heseltine's economic policies
were a betrayal of her free-market crusade.
   Heseltine, 57, portrayed himself as a Thatcherite with better
prospects than Mrs. Thatcher. He pointed to a flurry of opinion
polls that showed voters would be more favorable to the
Conservatives if he were party leader.
   He also promised to review an unpopular local services tax
sponsored by Mrs. Thatcher that is widely deplored as unfairly
favoring the wealthy.
   ``Increasingly they are saying, with sadness and reluctance,
that she must go,'' Heseltine said Monday.
   Heseltine's ambition to become prime minister had been evident
ever since he walked out of his last Cabinet meeting in January
1986. He had insisted for years, however, that he could not foresee
trying to unseat Mrs. Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher was first elected in 1979 and re-elected in 1983
and 1987. She has been in office longer than any European leader.
   The Conservatives, burdened by high inflation, high interest
rates and the unpopular local services tax have trailed the
opposition Labor Party in opinion polls for 16 months.
   The so-called poll tax replaced the property tax with a flat tax
on every adult. Millionaires pay the same as laborers, and for many
households the tax burden has increased.
   The Conservatives have suffered recent embarrassing losses in
elections to fill vacancies in Parliament.
   The revolt in the Tory ranks followed a 12-nation European
Community summit in Rome at the end of October. Eleven of the
leaders, over Mrs. Thatcher's vociferous dissent, agreed on a
timetable for establishing a central European bank, followed by a
single European currency.
   Her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, predicted that Mrs. Thatcher
would eventually fall into line with Britain's European partners,
as she had done in the past. But with signs indicating the
contrary, Howe resigned Nov. 1.
   A week ago, Howe delivered a scalding speech in the House of
Commons, accusing Mrs. Thatcher of jeopardizing Britain's vital
interests.
   Heseltine, who has long advocated closer ties within Europe,
entered the race for party lea.
   Heseltine's resignation, like Howe's and that of Nigel Lawson as
treasury chief last year, involved Euroder the next daypean integration.
In
Heseltine's case, it was a row over whether a European consortium -
his choice - or a U.S. corporation would take over the ailing
helicopter manufacturer, Westland PLC.
   All three former ministers also complained of Mrs. Thatcher's
forceful and sometimes abrasive style.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops, PLO Guerrillas Fight in Lebanon; Five Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops attacked a squad of PLO
guerrillas near Israel's self-designated security zone in southern
Lebanon, and one soldier and four guerrillas were killed in the
firefight, police said Tuesday.
   Ten other guerrillas fled, two bleeding of wounds they suffered
in the nightlong clash with Israeli troops and allied militiamen of
the South Lebanon Army.
   A Lebanese Army corporal driving on a nearby road in the
foothills of Mount Hermon also was wounded.
   The military command in Israel confirmed the clash near this
village, about three miles north of Israel's so-called security
zone.
   It identified the dead officer as 1st Lt. Yaron Yogev, 23. It
said he was shot after his unit spotted and attacked the
``terrorist'' squad.
   The battle with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades raged
under parachute flares for eight hours before the Israelis and SLA
militiamen pulled back to the security zone, police said.
   The bodies of the four guerrillas lay on the ground near Ain
Atta for several hours after the Israeli-SLA force withdrew.
   ``They may be booby-trapped. Explosive experts are needed to
examine the corpses before removing them,'' a police spokesman
said. He cannot be identified under standing rules.
   He said Israel and the SLA apparently were tipped about an
attempt to infiltrate the security zone.
   The police spokesman said the guerrillas belonged to Samir
Ghoshe's Palestine Popular Struggle Front.
   The group claimed responsibility in a statement distributed in
Beirut. It identified those killed as Mohammed Omar Sharif, Ahmed
al-Amed, both Palestinians, and Samir Izzidin Shami and Hamadah
Dafi, who were Lebanese.
   The Front, backed and financed by Libya, is a hard-line faction
within Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. It has
seldom been involved in attacks against Israel or its border
enclave.
   The wounded guerrillas are Palestinians. Police identified them
as the squad commander and his assistant, but did not provide
names.
   They were seen heading back with eight surviving attackers to
the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon after the
battle.
   ``We belong to the Palestine Popular Struggle Front and Libya's
Revolutionary Committees,'' one guerrilla shouted to a small group
of reporters, flashing his fingers in a victory sign. ``I'll shoot
you if you take pictures.''
   Israel staked out the security zone in 1985, when it withdrew
the bulk of its invading army after a three-year occupation.
   The zone covers 440 square miles, stretching from the
Mediterranean coast to the slopes of Mount Hermon. It is controlled
by the 3,000-strong SLA, which is backed by 1,000 Israeli soldiers.
   Radical Palestinians and pro-Syrian Lebanese leftist factions as
well as Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem fundamentalists are involved
in guerrilla warfare to force out the Israelis.
   The Israelis have left the security zone several times in the
past few months in pursuit of guerrillas, and a senior Israeli
official said Tuesday the army would continue that policy.
   ``When we think there are going to be terrorist attacks on
Israel from outside the security zone, we feel that we have a free
hand to act in order to prevent in advance attempts to
infiltrate,'' said Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press
Office.
   Olmert said there had been 17 infiltration attempts by land and
sea this year in which 36 Arabs and two Israelis were killed.
   ``None of them has reached Israel itself and this is exactly why
it is vitally important for us, even more than before, to emphasize
the significance of this security zone as an effective buffer,'' he
told reporters.

   An aide to Sen. John McCain told the Senate
Ethics Committee today that Sen. Dennis DeConcini tried to coax her
boss into meeting with federal regulators on behalf of savings and
loan millionaire Charles Keating Jr.
   The committee explored the role of the two Arizona senators in
those meetings with federal regulators as it began a fourth day of
hearings into allegations five senators improperly intervened on
behalf of Keating and his Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Today's testimony, while a detailed and tedious contrast to
dramatic declarations of innocence durig previous sessions,
revealed the divisions and conflicting stories among the five
senators who are battling for their political reputations and
futures.
   Gwendolyn van Paasschen, an economics aide to McCain, testified
she felt her boss was ``being coaxed along into'' a meeting with
top S&amp;L regulator Edwin Gray. She said she felt DeConcini wanted
McCain there because as a Republican he would lend a bipartisan
aura to the meeting.
   She was concerned, she said, because at the time of that April
1987 meeting, McCain had received more in campaign contributions
from Keating than had DeConcini, and thus stood to be more
embarrassed if word of the meeting became public.
   McCain went to that meeting but said he did so on his own, with
the understanding the agenda would be limited to a discussion of
the length of federal regulators' examination of Lincoln and a
disputed appraisal of Lincoln's assets. Other testimony has
suggested DeConcini went beyond that agenda to propose a deal with
regulators on Lincoln's behalf.
   ``It was my view that what Senator DeConcini suggested was
inappropriate,'' Ms. van Paasschen said.
   In addition to DeConcini and McCain, the committee is
investigating Sens. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   Keating was a financial contributor to the senators' campaigns
and favored causes. The collapse of his once high-flying empire is
estimated to cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion to cover
federally insured deposits.
   Ms. van Paasschen also testified that Riegle, who is chairman of
the Senate Banking Committee, ``was involved in setting up'' the
April 2, 1987, meeting with Gray, something Riegle has denied.
   Under questioning by Riegle's attorney, Tom Green, she said
learned about Riegle's role from McCain and others - despite
previous statements by her to investigators that she did not know
the extent of Riegle's involvement.
   Ms. Van Paasschen backed McCain's assertion that he refused to
negotiate with Gray in the April 2 meeting. According to earlier
testimony, McCain's refusal prompted Keating to call the senator a
``wimp.''
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett has contended
DeConcini went beyond the agreed-upon agenda for the meeting with
Gray. Bennett contends DeConcini offered the regulator a deal on
behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan - saying the thrift would make
more home loans if federal regulations limiting riskier investments
were dropped.
   McCain's administrative assistant, Chris Koch, testified that
McCain gave Keating an angry ``dressing down'' in a March 1987
meeting after being told Keating was calling him a ``wimp'' for
refusing to negotiate with Gray.
   McCain ``told Mr. Keating he had not spent 5{ years in a
prisoner of war camp (in Vietnam) to have his courage or integrity
questioned,'' Koch said. `` ... John said there were certain things
he could do and certain things he couldn't do. He said, `I can't go
in and do your bidding for you. ... I can't go in and break arms
and legs for you'.''
   In testimony Monday, Bennett ridiculed senators' claims that he
invented ethical standards in suggesting they dealt improperly with
Keating.
   ``In this body, with all due respect, are your standards a
double one?'' Bennett asked Monday. ``Are you above everyone
else?''
   Earlier Monday, DeConcini delivered a fiery, emotional defense
of his own dealings, in the last of the five senators' opening
statements.
   Bennett followed with a rebuttal to the senators in which he
directly challenged assertions by Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle
that there were no ethical rules that prohibited their efforts on
behalf of Keating, a constituent and contributor.
   ``The greatest deliberative body in the whole world - you can't
hack it under my standards?'' Bennett said. ``These are not my
standards ... These are your standards.''
   At issue is where the line falls separating appropriate help for
a constituent from improper intervention with federal officials on
behalf of a financial contributor.
   DeConcini, angrily defending his honor and his political career,
repeatedly referred to Bennett as ``special prosecutor,'' not his
correct title, and accused him of seizing on ``rumors ... lies ...
hearsay.''
   ``I submit this is disgraceful. I submit there is a bias, and I
think it is unconscionable,'' DeConcini said.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waited
only a few minutes Tuesday to declare that she would fight on in a
contest for the leadership of Britain and the Conservative Party.
   ``I am naturally very pleased that I got more than half the
parliamentary party and disappointed that it is not quite enough to
win on the first ballot,'' she told reporters outside the British
Embassy, where she had received news of the voting of party
parliamentarians in London.
   ``So I confirm that it is my intention to let my name go forward
to the second ballot,'' she added, appearing determined and
composed.
   Mrs. Thatcher failed by only two votes to gain a first-round
victory over former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine. She
received 204 votes, Heseltine gained 152 and 16 Conservatives
abstained. A first-ballot victory required 206 votes; but a
candidate needs only a majority to win in the second round next
Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who was in Paris for a European summit, was
expected to come under pressure from some of her allies to step
down rather than prolong the contest. The opposition Labor Party
also sought to take advantage of the political infighting by
proposing a motion of no confidence in her government.
   After talking very briefly to reporters, she went back into the
Embassy. She had earlier warned her host, President Francois
Mitterrand, that she might be a little late for the evening's
entertainment in Versailles.
   Earlier, Europe's longest-serving prime minister had busied
herself with top-level meetings and, according to sources close to
her, avoided telephoning London for updates on the election.
   Mrs. Thatcher started the day in talks with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mitterrand and continued with a series of
meetings with the heads of state of Turkey, the Netherlands and
Bulgaria. The talks were dominated by events in the Persian Gulf,
sources said.
   Mrs. Thatcher voted by proxy so she could attent the Paris
summit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Sources close to the prime minister said that her domestic
political problems did not come up during the talks Tuesday,
although several leaders did say ``good luck, and all that.''

   The Warsaw Pact's demise, predicted Tuesday by East
European leaders, may leave the countries searching for a security
organization to substitute for the once-mighty military alliance.
   Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall declared the organization
``an outdated military structure'' and said it should be scrapped
shortly.
   ``We trust that the conditions for dissolving the Warsaw Treaty
will be available before the end of 1991, but not later than spring
1992,'' he said in a speech to a 34-nation summit of the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   A day earlier, Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel described the
Warsaw Pact as ``an outdated remnant of the past.''
   ``It came into being as a typical product of Stalinist expansion
and was an instrument of subordination of the communist countries
to the Soviet Union,'' said Havel in his speech to the conference.
   Reflecting Antall's remarks, Hungary has been at the forefront
of the drive to get rid of the military alliance, which the Soviet
Union set up in 1955 in response to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Some other members of the Eastern alliance, however, are
hesitant to get rid of an organization that, despite its domination
by the Kremlin, has provided security guarantees.
   ``This is a big dilemma at the moment that no one has quite
solved,'' said Jane Sharp, a senior researcher at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute in Sweden.
   Havel said he could imagine the Warsaw Pact remaining - but only
as ``a temporary consultative organization'' on disarmament issues.
   Antall didn't appear willing to go that far.
   He told a news conference that Hungary did not see any reason
for keeping the Warsaw Pact around as a forum for discussions. ``We
do not consider the maintenance of a political organization
necessary either,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter.
   Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland are considered the most
interested in turning closer to the West. Polish officials, mindful
of their border with a united Germany in the strategic center of
Europe, have been less forward about doing away with the Warsaw
Pact.
   The other Warsaw Pact members are the Soviet Union, Romania and
Bulgaria. East Germany pulled out when it merged with its Western
neighbor.
   On Monday, the 22 nations representing NATO and the Warsaw Pact
signed a non-aggression pact, declaring an end to their military
rivalry and promising not to attack each other.
   There had been some thought that the summit of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which opened on Monday in
Paris, could set the building blocks for an over-arching political
and security organization that would draw in all the 34 nations.
   But that ambitious goal seems unlikely now.
   The summiteers were expected to wind up their meeting on
Wednesday by promising to meet together more often and agreeing to
set up a permanent secretariat in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   That still leaves the East European nations in a quandary.
   NATO, the 16-nation Western alliance, has moved quickly in
recent months to draw the East European countries closer to it. A
new liaison program was set up so that the countries' ambassadors
to Belgium, where NATO is located, would have access to the
alliance.
   But NATO officials repeatedly insist they cannot invite the
former Soviet satellites to apply for membership because such a
move would leave the Soviet Union isolated militarily. ``It would
be considered too provocative,'' said Ms. Sharp.
   There are few alternatives.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis has suggested the
European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, set up a defense
arm. It could, he said, adopt the Western European Union, a
security grouping of nine NATO nations.
   Were the East European nations to join the community in the
future, they would then have automatic security membership.
   Havel suggested that NATO ``could become one of the supports of
a new European security system.''
   If it agreed, he told the conference, the alliance ``should
perhaps proceed at a substantially faster pace in changing inwardly
and adapting itself to its new future.''
   With reduced East-West tensions, NATO is trying to emphasize its
political rather than military role.
   Havel suggested the Western alliance might put together
``association agreements with other European countries.'' He
offered no details but such accords would be designed to bring the
East European countries even closer to their Western neighbors.
   The Eastern nations could decide to shun any protectors at all
and go it alone.
   But Ms. Sharp said the financially ailing countries may find
that option difficult.
   ``They can't afford too much in the way of a credible defense
capability,'' she said. ``It costs a great deal to be credible
neutrals.''

   Masked gunmen, suspected to be Sikh
separatists, opened fire on shoppers in a crowded market on
Tuesday, killing at least 13 people and wounding 15.
   The assailants cut electric lines to the Krishna Kot market and
walked down the street firing automatic rifles at people thronging
shops before they closed for the day, police superintendent Sanjeev
Gupta said.
   At least 13 people were dead on arrival at the nearby Guru Teg
Bahadur Hospital, Gupta said. Eleven victims were Hindus and two
were Sikhs, he said.
   According to United News of India, at least 15 people were
killed by Sikh militants in other parts of Punjab state on Monday
and Tuesday.
   B.S. Bhatia, a doctor at the hospital in Amritsar, said eight of
the 15 injured were critically wounded. ``Most of them have been
shot in the face or chest,'' he said.
   Bhatia spoke in the emergency ward of the hospital, which was
besieged by relatives and friends of the victims. Some of the
wounded screamed in pain.
   At Krishna Kot, shops and restaurants were open but unattended.
Residents said many shopkeepers were among the victims or had taken
the wounded to the hospital.
   Subhash Kumar, a resident of Krishna Kot who witnessed the
attack from the roof of his home, said the victims were standing
outside shops when they were gunned down. ``I saw at least three
people killed outside a video store,'' he said. ``Two others were
killed in front of a restaurant.''
   Kishan Lal, one of the wounded, said he saw at least five or six
attackers. ``They came on foot and they were masked,'' he told
reporters from a hospital bed. Lal sustained a bullet wound in his
left leg.
   One 18-year-old boy said he survived because he stopped to
smoke.
   ``I stopped to buy cigarettes and my two friends went ahead to
rent a video,'' said Monu, who refused to give his surname. ``I saw
them getting shot.''
   Another resident said he bolted himself inside his house when he
heard gunfire. ``I could hear the militants shout `Long Live
Khalistan!' above the gunshots,'' said Jaj Srivastava.
   Khalistan is the name Sikh militants have proposed for their
homeland.
   It was the latest in a series of attacks blamed on Sikh
militants in Punjab state during the past week. At least 120 people
have been killed since Nov. 13.
   Victims have included passengers pulled out of a bus and shot,
people going on morning walks and members of security forces. The
militants were also blamed for planting time bombs in two clubs in
the state capital, Chandigarh, on Friday which injured at least 12
people.
   Amritsar, a city of a million people, is renowned for the Golden
Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine. The city has been the center of
the Sikh separatist campaign since the insurrection began in 1982.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab, a rich, farming state. Sikh militants
launched their campaign for independence claiming their community
is discriminated against by the Hindus, who make up 82 percent of
he country's population.
   At least 2,850 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
violence blamed on the militants.

<HEAD>White House Says Agreement On U.N. Resolution Unlikely at Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said today it was ``very unlikely''
that President Bush would be able, before a European summit ends
Wednesday, to muster support from the Soviet Union for a compromise
United Nations resolution on using military force against Iraq.
   Just a few hours earlier, Bush had voiced optimism that some
agreement would be found to overcome Soviet objections, saying,
``Just be patient and all will be well.''
   But, as the summit wound down its second day, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it did not appear that Bush would
have a deal in hand before he goes to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.
   Despite a last-minute meeting on the subject between Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, Fitzwater said: ``I think it is very unlikely we
would have anything specific while in Paris.''
   He confirmed that several proposed draft resolutions are being
considered for submission to the UN Security Council dealing with
use of military force in the gulf. But, he said, ``Our
consideration of the resolution does not have a timetable.''
   Meanwhile, both Soviet and U.S. officials raised the possibility
of a summit in January in Moscow between Bush and Gorbachev.
   ``We do not have a specific date at this point,'' Fitzwater
said, reiterating an earlier administration insistence that the
summit be held only if a treaty to limit long-range nuclear weapons
be ready to be signed.
   The Soviet statement made no mention of the treaty signing.
   Fitzwater said that the administration believed the treaty would
be ready in January for signing. ``That's what we've been hoping
for and shooting for,'' he said.
   Summit leaders from 34 countries, meeting here on the future of
Europe in the post Cold War era, held a closed-door session at the
end of their business today, but participants said the gulf crisis
did not come up.
   Furthermore, ``There will be no common declaration by the 34 on
the gulf,'' said Hubert Vedrine spokesman for French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Vedrine said no one brought up the matter.
   Neither Bush nor Gorbachev was on the list of those who spoke at
the closed-door session. Participants said that environmental
concerns and immigration issues were among the topics discussed.
   Baker met for two and a-half hours with Shevardnadze and
scheduled a second meeting with him later in the day. A meeting
between Bush and the Soviet president on Monday night failed to
produce a U.S.-sought statement from the Soviet president endorsing
a U.N. resolution authorizIng military force.
   Meanwhile, Bush conferred with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey,
which is allied with the United States against Iraq, and accepted
an invitation to visit Turkey in the first half of 1991. Turkey is
letting American bombers use its airfields, but has expressed
little enthusiasm about a military confrontation with its neighbor.
   During a picture-taking session, Bush said that ``Nobody has
been more steadfast than the Turks and Mr. Ozal. I have no
complaints, only gratitude and I'm glad we're together on this
one.''
   Asked if he had any complaints about Soviet support, Bush
replied, ``Just be patient and all will be well.''
   The gulf crisis has overshadowed the unprecedented summit of the
34-member Conference on Cooperation and Security in Europe.
   Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall told the summit today
that he hoped ``the conditions for the complete dissolution of the
Warsaw Pact'' will be created by early 1992. ``We are happy that
the participating states of the (Warsaw Pact) have shown agreement
over the dissolution of the military organization.''
   Antall is the first Warsaw Pact country leader to talk about the
complete demise of the pact and to offer a deadline. In the past,
the leaders have spoken only of ending the Warsaw Pact's military
function.
   Against the backdrop of the conference, leaders held a flurry of
meetings to discuss how best to get Iraq out of Kuwait. Gorbachev
met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has
advocated military action against Iraq. Thatcher also met with
French President Francois Mitterrand, who like Gorbachev has
counseled patience.
   Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet officials said Bush and Gorbachev
were planning a Moscow summit in early January, at which they hoped
to sign an agreement reducing their long-range nuclear arsenals by
up to 50 percent. U.S. officials said Bush would only go if the
agreement was ready, but they expressed confidence negotiators
could resolve the remaining obstacles in time.
   Bush is trying to rally support behind a new UN Security Council
resolution that would authorize military action against Iraq,
presumably if it does not end its occupation of Kuwait by a
specified date.
   Baker has been busy presenting the administration's case to the
15 members of the Security Council. Still, the administration has
been having a hard time finding agreement on the language for such
a resolution, especially given Gorbachev's reluctance to get on
board.
   During a picture-taking session with Bush Monday, Gorbachev was
asked by reporters whether he favored force or patience toward
Iraq.
   ``I think we all need patience,'' the Soviet leader replied,
``but that does not mean that we are going to weaken or retreat''
from earlier U.N. resolutions calling for an unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal.
   ``We certainly will seek to resolve that situation and we must
be firm in our position on that,'' he added.
   Nonetheless, administration aides said today that the White
House remains hopeful progress can be made toward the wording of a
new resolution. But on the eve of Bush's visit to the Middle East
agreement has yet to materialize.
   After the 34-nation summit on European security wraps up on
Wednesday, Bush will fly to Saudi Arabia for a Thanksgiving visit
with troops deployed in the Persian Gulf region.
   The gulf crisis was the chief topic in 2{ hours of talks between
Bush and Gorbachev during Monday's opening day of the summit called
to discuss the future of Europe in the post-Cold War era.
   The conference resumed today, to be capped by a star-studded
ballet performance and dinner in the famous Hall of Mirrors at
Versailles palace.
   Amid the celebration of peace and the collapse of military
rivalries in Europe, there was jarring news from the Middle East.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he would send an additional
250,000 troops to Kuwait, nearly doubling the occupation force in
the oil-rich emirate. The buildup apparently was in response to
Bush's decision to augment the 230,000 U.S. troops now in the
Persian Gulf region by 200,000 personnel.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called Saddam's
announcement ``another instance of him thumbing his nose at the
United Nations,'' which has demanded that Iraq withdraw from
Kuwait.
   Further, Fitzwater said, the buildup ``emphasizes that we must
keep the pressure on with regards to U.N. sanctions. It also
underscores the cynicism with which Saddam Hussein treats the
hostages.''
   Baker will take his lobbying to Yemen and beyond later this
week. Yemen is the only Arab nation in the U.N. Security Council
and has in the past shown sympathy for Iraq. It will assume the
council's rotating presidency in December.
   After Bush's meeting with Gorbachev, Fitzwater said, ``Everyone
agrees that you cannot rule out that option'' of military action.
Yet, he said, the United States has not decided to actually seek
the resolution on military force.
   Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said the two leaders
``came to the very important conclusion that not all the
possibilities have been exhausted and the U.N. resolutions (already
approved) still have to be tried.
   He said Bush and Gorbachev discussed the ``conceptual basis of
what kinds of circumstances might exist that would require this
option (of military force) to be pursued.''

   Overweight children have greater long-term
success controlling their weight if their parents provide early
support for exercising and eating right, researchers said.
   Ten years after participating in a weight-loss program as 6- to
12-year-olds, children whose parents got similar weight-control
training were significantly less obese than those whose parents
received less training, according to a study published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``We think the important finding is in the modeling,'' said
psychologist Leonard H. Epstein, head of the University of
Pittsburgh's Childhood Obesity Clinic and leader of the research
team.
   ``If you have children who you don't want to eat potato chips,
you can't sit in front of them eating Ho-Hos.''
   Epstein's group also concluded that pre-adolescent weight loss
had no effect on height development, contrary to the findings of
several shorter-term studies.
   Two other childhood obesity experts called Epstein's results
surprisin because previous research has shown that fat children
will grow into fat adults and that weight lost in treatment
programs is quickly regained.
   Those experts said further study was needed on whether treatment
of obesity in childhood can produce effects that persist into young
adulthood.
   In Epstein's project, an initial group of 75 obese children and
their parents were randomly assigned to three groups. Study
criteria required the children be more than 20 percent over ideal
weight for their age, height and sex; both parents living at home,
one of whom had to be obese; and one parent willing to attend
treatment meetings with their child.
   All subjects were to attend eight weekly treatment meetings
followed by six monthly meetings, then by 21-month, five-year and
10-year meetings.
   All were instructed to follow a regimen that included a
1,200-to-1,500-calorie-per-day diet and an aerobic exercise
program.
   In the first group, both parents and children received
reinforcement for losing weight and were trained to praise other
family members for changing eating and exercise habits.
   In the second group, only the children received reinforcement
for losing weight but were similarly trained to praise family
members for weight-control behaviors.
   Parents and children in the third group received reinforcement
only for attending the meetings. They received information about
social reinforcement without specific training in how to use the
method.
   All subjects lost weight initially. At the 10-year mark, the
children in the first group were, on average, 7.5 percent less
overweight than at the beginning of the study while those in the
second and third groups were 4.5 percent and 14.3 percent fatter,
respectively.
   Parents in all three groups were more obese after 10 years than
at the start of the study.
   In a journal editorial, Dr. Albert J. Stunkard of the University
of Pennsylvania medical school and Dr. Robert I. Berkowitz of the
Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic cautioned that the ``treatment
did not prevent obesity, it limited it.''
   They called Epstein's results surprising, perhaps because of his
relatively small study sample: intact, middle-class families in
which the parents were likely to be very supportive of their
children's efforts.
   They said replication of Epstein's study ``is clearly needed''
before the findings can be embraced.

<HEAD>New AIDS Vaccine Candidate Approved For Early Clinical Trials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new AIDS vaccine candidate that has been
shown to work in one chimpanzee was approved Tuesday for early
human clinical tests, the Food and Drug Administration announced.
   The candidate vaccine was developed through the cooperation of
the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the
National Cancer Institute and Immuno-U.S., Inc., a Rochester, Mich.
branch of an Austrian company.
   At a news conference Tuesday, company officials said the
clinical trials will test the safety of the vaccine and determine
if the 60 test subjects develop antibodies against human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. This
first step of human testing, called Phase I trials, will not use
AIDS patients.
   If the vaccine proves to be safe and shows promise, then Phase
II trials will more thoroughly test for protection against AIDS. A
final phase of testing would be required before the FDA releases
the vaccine for general use.
   The candidate vaccine is a genetically-engineered synthetic
glycoprotein that was derived from the envelope, or skin, of the
HIV1 virus. This part of the virus envelope is called gp160. The
theory is that the body's immune system will react to gp160 and
develop antibodies. These antibodies then would trigger an immune
response in the body should there be contact with the HIV virus.
   Dr. Martha Eibl, director of AIDS vaccine research at Immuno AG,
the parent company of Immuno-U.S., said that two forms of the
vaccine were tested on four chimpanzees.
   The chimps were injected with the candidate vaccine and then
injected with the AIDS virus, using a dose that is 100 times the
amount needed to cause an infection in the laboratory.
   All four of the chimps developed some immune response, and one
of the animals remained free of AIDS.
   ``It has protected a chimp from productive infection for nearly
three years,'' Eibl said of the candidate vaccine. ``That is the
longest protection up to now.''
   She said the human clinical trials will determine if the human
immune system can develop a similar response.
   Dr. Robert Belshe, a professor of medicine at the St. Louis
University School of Medicine and coordinator of the clinical
trials, said that 60 volunteers at five clinical centers already
have signed up. The first in a series of vaccinations with the test
vaccine will start next month, he said.
   Belshe emphasized that although the candidate vaccine uses a
synthetic model of a protein from the AIDS virus, ``you cannot get
AIDS from this vaccine.''
   He said the volunteers are not infected with AIDS and not at
risk of catching the disease. Later clinical trials, he said, would
include people who are at risk for AIDS.
   Belshe said that it could take eight to 10 years before the
vaccine would be ready for general use.
   FDA officials said the candidate vaccine is the sixth to undergo
early human clinical trials. One of the others also involved the
use of gp160.
   The difference with the Immuno vaccine is that it has had
successful tests in chimpanzees, said Dani Bolognesi, a Duke
University AIDS researcher and a member of the NIAID AIDS vaccine
selection committee.
   But he emphasized that the Immuno product is still in a very
early stage of development.
   ``I don't consider it a vaccine as yet,'' said Bolognesi. ``We
need to know the human response.''
   Bolognesi said the Immuno gp160 product is ``much more native''
than other candidate gp160 vaccines. He said Immuno used mammal
cells to produce the protein through genetic engineering. Other
gp160 candidate vaccines, he said, used insect cells.
   Most experts believe it is unlikely that a vaccine based on a
single AIDS protein will provide complete protection against the
virus. The virus changes constantly and a working vaccine would
have to trigger antibodies that would attack the virus no matter
how it changes.
   More than likely, said Bolognesi, the final vaccine will be a
``cocktail'' that includes several of the viral proteins.
   The human clinical trials on the Immuno candidate vaccine will
be conducted at St. Louis University School of Medicine; the Johns
Hopkins Center for Immunization Research in Baltimore; the
University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle; the
University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, N.Y., and
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn. Each center
will use 12 volunteer subjects.

<TEXT>
   Government supporters and opponents
scuffled Tuesday after a pro-government rally at which Premier
Petre Roman defended his economic reforms.
   Roman for the first time also demanded tougher legal action
against those who participated in the brutal Communist regime of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   About 20,000 supporters of the governing National Salvation
Front, some bused in from far-off provinces, attended the rally in
the capital's huge Aviation Square.
   Later, about 1,000 anti-government demonstrators marched down
the capital's main boulevard, shouting slogans against Roman and
President Ion Iliescu.
   Fights broke out with Front supporters. Witnesses said several
people were injured and one man broke his arm.
   State TV showed some people beating others with sticks but it
was unclear whether they were government supporters or opponents.
   Front Vice President Claudio Iordache said on the TV news that
some people had been hospitalized, and he criticized the police for
failing to curb the violence.
   ``We can no longer tolerate such police inefficiency,'' he said.
   Tensions have escalated in Romania since the Front-dominated
government introduced price reforms on Nov. 1. The prices of some
basic goods since have doubled and tripled, but energy, rents and
essential foodstuffs were not affected.
   Roman defended his economic reforms at Tuesday's rally.
   ``We are a society that is evolving toward prosperity and a
higher standard of living,'' he told the Front supporters. ``We all
want to live better.''
   The rally was the Front's answer to last Thursday's
anti-governmentdemonstrations by more than 100,000 Romanians. They
were organized by the Civil Alliance opposition group.
   The government supporters chanted ``Down with communism!'' - the
rallying cry of the opposition movements, which charge that the
Front itself is secretly dominated by Communists.
   Roman said the Front had nothing to hide and was not ``involved
in anything unclean.''
   He also acknowledged the government's failure to combat
corruption, saying: ``We did not tackle corruption early enough,
but now we can tolerate it no further.''
   For the first time since becoming premier during the December
revolution that ousted Ceausescu, Roman appealed for stronger
action to bring the country's former leaders to justice.
   ``We have not succeeded in prosecuting the top Communist
leaders, the Securitate, the police, the ones who blindly followed
the dictatorship that brought the country to ruin,'' he told the
rally.
   ``They dragged us to the point that all we knew was misfortune
and sadness, and now must be brought to justice,'' he said.
   To date, relatively few Communist leaders have been prosecuted.
Earlier this year, four of Ceausescu's closest aides were convicted
of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment.
   Ceausescu's son, Nicu, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for
``instigating serious crime.''
   The 23 members of Ceausescu's politburo are presently on trial,
and in the western city of Timisoara, 25 local officers are on
trial for their role in the massacre that sparked last December's
revolution.
   But the trial of Iulian Vlad, the head of Ceausescu's feared
Securitate secret police, was suspended last month for lack of
evidence.
   All the charges have to do with the attempts to suppress the
revolution, in which more than 1,000 Romanians were killed.

   Gideons International says it has

Arabia.
   ``We target the highways and byways of life to reach people who
wouldn't otherwise walk into a church,'' said W.W. Vardell,
Gideons' budget services manager.
   Some 575,000 Bibles have accompanied U.S. soldiers to the Saudi

   The Bibles were requested by chaplins stationed in the United
States and in Saudi Arabia, Vardell said. Some troops brought the
Bibles with them and other copies were shipped to bases in the
Moslem country, said Vardell.
   Since last year, the Gideons sent 1.5 million Bibles to the
Soviet Union and 600,000 to Eastern Europe, with 1 million more to
be sent there in coming months, Vardell said.
   The Gideons, based in Nashville, has distributed 500 million Old

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President
Bush are ``shooting for'' a January summit in Moscow in hopes that
negotiators can work out problems with a nuclear arms treaty before
then, officials said Tuesday.
   Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, declined to give an
exact date for the summit, saying only that ``U.S. President George
Bush will pay an official visit to Moscow at the beginning of
January.''
   Bush had said he would not go to Moscow until work was complete
on the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Aides said
that setting a date for the summit could spur negotiators to clear
the final obstacles.
   ``If it's ready, they will sign it,'' Soviet spokesman Vitaly
Ignatenko told a briefing at the Soviet Embassy in Paris.
   Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, said that no date had been
set for the meeting, although the two leaders hoped for a January
summit in Moscow to sign the accord.
   ``The president hopes to conclude a START agreement early next
year, which would be signed in Moscow at the beginning of next
year,'' Fitzwater said at a briefing.
   ``We are not aware of a firm date. There has been talk of Moscow
in January and a treaty would ready at that time,'' he said.
   Completion of the agreement remains a U.S. prerequisite for a
Moscow summit, and early January was a likely date, he said.
   ``That's what we have been talking about, shooting for. That's
in the ballpark,'' he said.
   It would be the fourth summit for Bush and Gorbachev, not
counting a dinner meeting Monday night, when they discussed the
treaty. The pact calls for cuts of up to 50 percent in long-range
nuclear armed bombers, missiles and submarines.
   Completing it is ``obviously within our grasp,'' another U.S.
official said. ``If you don't use the summit as an opportunity it
may slide away.''
   Bush and Gorbachev are in Paris for the 34-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, billed as the formal end of the
Cold War and the beginning of a new era in international relations.
   The highlight of the Paris summit came on Monday, when leaders
of 22 North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact nations
signed an agreement cutting their conventional forces of tanks and
other weapons in Europe.
   It is the most far-reaching arms control accord in history. In
combination with the proposed nuclear pact, it would vastly reduce
the military machines that have been facing each other since the
end of World War II.
   Bush had hoped to go to Moscow in December to sign the START
pact, but negotiators are still wrestling with three major
unresolved issues. They are:
   - The kinds of testing and other restrictions to impose on the
154 heavy, ground-based SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles
the Soviets will retain under the treaty.
   - Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapon, as the United States demands. That would mean
counting Backfires against numerical weapons limits established in
the treaty.
   - The restrictions to be imposed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies. This issue primarily
concerns arms Washington would like to turn over to Britain outside
the treaty's limits.
   Officials said they were confident the issues could be resolved
by the first half of January.
   The two leaders met in December 1988, after Bush was elected but
before he became president. They held a shipboard summit off the
Mediterranean Sea island of Malta in December 1989 during the
collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe.
   They met again last May in Washington, where Bush and Gorbachev
signed agreements to eliminate chemical weapons.
   Their most summit was in Helsinki on Sept. 9. That one-day
meeting was devoted largely to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>CNN Hands Over Noriega Prison Tapes to Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN attorneys on Tuesday handed a federal
magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of Manuel Noriega's
telephone calls, saying they were confident the recordings would
show his rights were never violated.
   The network acted in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's
weekend refusal to lift the trial judge's order that CNN cease
broadcasting the tapes, and surrender them to determine if their
use invaded Noriega's attorney-client right to confidentiality.
   ``We hope and are confident that the court will conclude that
the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances,''
said Steven Korn, chief counsel to CNN's parent company, Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. ``CNN believes ... that the conversations
that were telecast were not attorney-client privileged
conversations.''
   CNN surrendered the tapes to U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler in his chambers, but the judge said he did not want to
hear any potentially privileged conversations. He ordered them
given to U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff, who will make and study
transcripts and report his conclusions back to the Hoeveler, the
judge assigned to hear Noriega's drug-smuggling trial.
   No time limit was set, but Noriega's lead attorney Frank Rubino
said the judge guaranteed it would done ``with dispatch.'' It was
not known if the lawyers would be called in to consult with the
magistrate, or if a hearing would be held when his report was
issued, said Rubino.
   Korn refused to say how many tapes were handed over, or to
describe their contents or origins. He said the recordings
presented Tuesday were copies, not originals.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with privileged matters -
in part because Rubino tacitly agreed to broadcasting them when he
identified them on the air.
   But Rubino, who asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against
CNN, strongly disagreed, although he acknowledged he does not know
the contents of most of the tapes.
   ``There are numerous conversations with the general wherein ...
defense strategies were discussed, witnesses were discussed, and
things of that nature,'' Rubino said. ``We assume that to be what's
on the tape.''
   Hoeveler refused to set an immediate contempt hearing against
CNN. He said he must await a decision by Chief U.S. District Judge
James Lawence King on a motion by CNN asking that the trial judge
be removed from the tapes case.
   Rubino has subpoenaed CNN to produce a log of how many times the
network and its affiliates telecast a tape between Noriega and his
defense team.
   Noriega is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center. Prison officials routinely tape prisoners' phone
conversations for security reasons, unless the inmate indicates
beforehand that he is talking wiuth his attorney.
   The FBI is investigating how the tapes were leaked.
   Noriega co-counsel Jon May noted that the defense has asked for
contempt penalties of $300,000 per airing, and said one estimate of
damages was $12 million. That money should go to the cash-strapped
defense, he said.
   ``There is ample precedent for a court to direct a fine to one
of the parties,'' May said. ``And we are certainly, we believe, the
party most injured by CNN's actions, and ... would have the
greatest claim.''
   Hoeveler is considering whether to replace Rubino and May with
government-paid counsel. The judge had not announced a decision by
Tuesday.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator is jailed outside of Miami on
charges of taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial
isn't expected to begin before the spring.

   The Persian Gulf crisis has intruded into
the world of the homeless with 200 homeless people forced to move
out of an armory to make way for National Guardsmen preparing for
action in the Mideast.
   The transformation of the Newton armory was completed Tuesday as
cots were moved out and dozens of guardsmen wearing battle fatigues
took care of final details in preparation for shipping out this
weekend for training at a military base before heading overseas.
   Community activists who ran the homeless shelter at the armory
had to perform their own mobilization the day before, moving beds,
pots, pans and other materials to a National Guard armory several
miles away in Cambridge.
   ``We can mobilize enormous resources for Operation Desert
Shield, but we can't seem to mobilize the same resources for people
who are homeless right here in our own country,'' said Philip
Mangano, executive director of the Greater Boston Adult Shelter
Alliance.
   When it was learned that the armory would have to clear the
homeless out to make room for the troops, ``our first concern was
to find them another place,'' said Guard Capt. Jayme
Casgrain-Guido.
   The unit based at the armory is the 972nd Military Police
Company. It was placed on alert last week after President Bush
ordered mobilization of an 72,000 more soldiers from the Guard and
military reserves.
   The 200-member unit received its marching orders Saturday.
   The armory had served as an overflow shelter, housing homeless
people who could not find space elsewhere. Activists have been
trying for months to open smaller shelters that would end the need
for the armory and offer more personalized attention.
   Homeless people using the shelter were picked up each day in
Boston and driven out to the armory in the suburb just west of
Boston.
   The transfer of the homeless from the Newton armory to the
Cambridge armory will prompt community activists to work more
quickly to find alternative sites, Mangano said.
   ``Do we know when the Cambridge armory might have to be ready
for Operation Desert Shield? The word might come down all of a
sudden,'' he said.
   Other armories around Masssachusetts also have been pressed into
non-military uses. State officials decided this year to let Hampden
County Sheriff Michael Ashe use a Holyoke armory as a jail after he
commandeered another armory in nearby Springfield to ease prison
overcrowding.
   Col. David Gavigan of the Guard administration said that armory
likely would remain a jail even if local units were called to
active duty.

<HEAD>Good Crops Elsewhere Will Reduce U.S. Grain Exports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bumper crops elsewhere in the world have
lowered prospects for U.S. grain exports in the coming year, an
Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   Although analysts were not specific on the effects, the report
noted other developments that will have a bearing on farm income in
1991 and beyond.
   ``The U.S. economy continues to grow very slowly, and the
outlook is for more slow growth, or even a brief contraction,'' the
report said. ``Given an orderly unwinding of current problems,
though, growth should pick up in 1992.''
   Over the longer haul, it said, forecasts suggest that inflation,
interest rates and the value of the dollar will drift downward.
   ``Lower interest rates would put downward pressure on farmers'
production costs and a lower exchange rate would aid farm
exports,'' the report said.
   But good crops in much of the world ``have lowered prospects for
U.S. exports of wheat, coarse grains and rice,'' the report added.
   ``Global wheat output is expected to rise 11 percent in 1990-91,
setting a record,'' the report said. ``A smaller gain in coarse
grain production is likely, and world trade will slip. A record
world rice crop is expected, and trade will increase only
slightly.''
   The monthly report by the department's Economic Research Service
also showed that the net cash income of farmers this year is still
expected to be a record, probably in the range of $59 billion to
$63 billion.
   That is unchanged from previous forecasts by the agency. Net
cash income is the difference between gross cash income and cash
expenses.
   Another report showed the value of U.S. farm exports in the 1990
fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, at $40.2 billion, up from $39.7
billion in 1989. That was the first time export values pushed over
$40 billion in a year since the record $43.8 billion in 1981.
   No predictions were made for fiscal 1991 but those forecasts
will be issued next week at the department's annual outlook
conference. The conference also will hear USDA forecasts of 1991
food prices, reflecting the higher energy costs and other factors
relating to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The USDA agency, in a third report issued Tuesday, said the
cereal grain needs for 55 low-income countries in 1990-91 ``are
substantial, despite the favorable outlook for supplies'' globally.
   ``East Africa and the relatively populous region of South Asia
will require the most assistance, followed by Latin America and
Southern Africa,'' the report said.
   The analysis added that ``the situation reflects poor harvests
in Ethiopia and Sudan, good crops in most of Asia and declining
commercial cereal imports in most regions due to foreign exchange
shortages.''

   Atlantis and its five astronauts
glided to an smooth landing in Florida today, becoming the first
shuttle crew to touch down at the Kennedy Space Center in five
years.
   It was the sixth time a space shuttle has landed here. The last
time was in 1985, when Discovery blew a tire, but today's landing
on the paved runway was smooth.
   Atlantis swooped through a brilliant blue sky, accompanied by
the customary twin sonic booms, and touched down at 4:43 p.m. EST
after circling the world 80 times.
   Atlantis was diverted to Kennedy by wind and damp runways at its
the California desert landing site.
   ``Welcome home. It sure was a beautiful sight,'' Mission Control
told the crew.
   The descent began about an hour earlier when Atlantis' commander
Richard Covey and pilot Frank Culbertson Jr. fired the shuttle's
twin braking rockets. The firings reduced the spaceship's speed by
156 mph and sent it gliding toward Florida.
   Workers at Kennedy had to scramble to prepare for the landing,
assembling a convoy of support vehicles and bringing in extra
personnel.
   ``There's no nervousness involved,'' said Bruce Buckingham, a
Kennedy spokesman. ``We've got everybody in place making preps for
this. It's just a matter of implementing our plans.''
   Late Monday, showers moved across the Mojave Desert base,
dampening the lake bed runways. About a quarter-inch of rain fell
on the hard-packed desert floor, stopping before sunrise.
   The Air Force checked the runways and determined they were
unsuitable for landing, said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato. The
concrete runway would have been the only one open at Edwards today
and probably Wednesday.
   The outlook appeared to be no better at Edwards on Wednesday,
prompting NASA officials to choose Kennedy as a landing site today.
The sky over Kennedy was clear today, and winds were well within
landing limits.
   Atlantis, whose five astronauts put a spy satellite in orbit
during the Pentagon's last secret shuttle mission, has enough power
and supplies to stay in space until Thursday, said Randy Stone,
chief of the flight director's office. The shuttle was launched
from Kennedy last Thursday night.
   The three-mile runway at Kennedy provides less room for
maneuvering than the wide-open desert and the weather there is
usually more unstable. Discovery, the last shuttle to use the
Kennedy runway, blew a tire and sustained brake damage during
landing in 1985.
   On Monday, NASA had to call off the landing attempt minutes
before the shuttle was to begin its fiery plunge to Earth.
   ``The weather, as it sometimes does, pulled a dirty trick on
us,'' Stone said.
   Covey's response to Monday's delay was that ``the crew feels all
dressed up with no place to go,'' Mission Control said.
   The other crew members are Army Maj. Charles Gemar, Air Force
Lt. Col. Carl Meade and Marine Col. Robert Springer, mission
specialists.
   The flight has been shrouded in secrecy since Atlantis blasted
into orbit Thursday night. But Stone said Monday the crew was doing
well and there had been only a few minor problems.
   ``This is just about the cleanest orbiter than I can remember in
the program,'' he said. Atlantis and Columbia were grounded during
the summer because of hydrogen leaks, but both were cleared for
flight last month.
   Sources said the crew deployed a satellite Friday that is
capable of spying on Iraq by either photographic surveillance or
electronic eavesdropping.
   The mission is the seventh and last secret shuttle flight for
the Pentagon, which will use unmanned rockets to launch classified
payloads from now on. The military will use the shuttle two more
times, but those cargoes will not be classified.
   Columbia is scheduled to fly next in December with seven
astronauts and an observatory.

   An anti-smoking group's lawsuit that
accused Philip Morris Co. of violating a new state public smoking
law was dismissed on a technicality Tuesday.
   But Anne Morrow Donley, executive director of Virginia Group to
Alleviate Smoking in Public, corrected the problem after the
10-minute hearing and filed the lawsuit again. The lawsuit alleges
that Philip Morris violated the law by allowing smoking in the gift
shop at its cigarette plant in Richmond.
   Substitute General District Judge Joseph Spinella said the
lawsuit should have been filed by the state instead of by Virginia
GASP. ``You have a right to try the suit in the name of the
commonwealth but not in the name of your organization,'' Spinella
said.
   A hearing was set for Dec. 11 after Ms. Donley changed the
wording to show she was acting for the state.
   Philip Morris attorney Lewis T. Booker, who had argued that the
lawsuit was filed incorrectly, declined to comment after the
hearing.
   A state law that took effect July 1 forbids smoking in indoor
cashier lines along with many other public places. Violators must
pay a $25 civil fine.
   Ms. Donley said the Philip Morris gift shop has no sign that
says smoking is forbidden and a tour guide told visitors this month
that smoking was allowed in the shop.
   ``There are some procedural problems in the law,'' Ms. Donley
said. ``However, the law is very clear that smoking shall be
prohibited in cashier lines.''
   Robert Moore, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said the plant has
no sign in the shop but believes it is following state law.
   ``We are very gratified by the court's decision. The action
taken against Philip Morris was a frivolous publicity stunt and a
waste of taxpayers' money,'' Moore said.
   Virginia GASP has had mixed results in challenging alleged
violators of the public smoking law.
   The group has won cases against Food Lion stores in the Richmond
area but a case brought against a couple for smoking in a Winn
Dixie store in Colonial Heights was dismissed because the judge
said there was conflicting evidence.

   Three children were caught hanging out on Atlanta
streets the first night the city enforced its new curfew, but
police predicted Tuesday that more violators would be out this
Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
   ``That's when the ordinance will be tested,'' said Atlanta
police Deputy Chief W.J. Taylor.
   Police said crisp evening temperatures and plenty of advance
warning probably made those under 17 stay indoors after 11 p.m.
Monday, when the curfew went into effect. The city has threatened
to jail parents of youngsters caught on the street after hours.
   Of the three violators detained by police, two were picked up by
their parents and the third, a 12-year-old girl, was taken home
after her parents refused to pick her up, Taylor said.
   The 12-year-old's parents were given a warning, Taylor said. The
other parents were not.
   The curfew ordinance, signed by Mayor Maynard Jackson Nov. 8, is
the strictest the city has had since the early 1980s, during the
Atlanta child murders. The American Civil Liberties Union has
threatened to challenge the law's constitutionality, but city
officials say it is needed to help the reverse the highest rate of
serious crime in the city.
   FBI statistics show Atlanta had 210 reported serious crimes per
1,000 residents last year, higher than any U.S. city. There were
246 murders in Atlanta in 1989, but 106 between January and June
this year, down 14 percent.
   Under the curfew, those under 17 must be off the street from 11
p.m. to 6 a.m. weeknights and midnight to 6 a.m. weekends, unless
participating in school activities, returning from work or
accompanied by an adult.
   Parents of repeat offenders could get up to 60 days in jail or
$1,000 in fines. City Councilwoman Davetta Johnson, who proposed
the ordinance, said the penalties are designed to force parents to
keep track of their children's activities.
   Police Chief Eldrin A. Bell said officers would focus on ``known
drug locations, nightclubs and places of ill repute'' in enforcing
the curfew.
   Michael Hauptman, president of the local ACLU chapter, said his
organization plans to challenge the ordinance in court as soon as
it receives a complaint.
   Angelo Fuster, spokesman for the mayor, said police do not plan
to sweep the streets in search of violators. ``The officers would
not be so busy with the curfew ordinance that they would ignore
more serious crimes,'' he said.
   A similar curfew was adopted at the height of a series of 29
slayings of young blacks in metropolitan Atlanta in the early
1980s. The original curfew applied to children 15 or younger and
did not penalize their parents. It had rarely been enforced in
recent years.
   Wayne Williams was convicted in 1982 of murder in two of the
slayings between 1979 and 1981. Investigators have blamed him for
22 more of the slayings. He is serving two life sentences.

<HEAD>`Baby Moses' Celebrates Fifth Anniversary of Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The youngster first known to the world
as Baby Moses had a hospital party Tuesday to celebrate his fifth
year as one of the world's youngest heart transplant recipients.
   Eddie Anguiano, who was born in 1985 with fatal underdevelopment
of the left side of the heart, is healthy, rambunctious and a
little terror at his pre-school, said his mother, Maria Anguiano.
   ``He's doing really good,'' she said. ``I send him to school so
they can wear him out for me.''
   Initially identified only as Baby Moses because of his parents'
concern for privacy, Eddie was only 4 days old when doctors at Loma
Linda University Medical Center implanted a tiny donor heart in his
chest on Nov. 20, 1985. Identity of the donor was never disclosed.
   He was the third infant to receive a heart transplant and the
first to survive more than a few weeks.
   Eddie joined his surgeon, Dr. Leonard Bailey, and others on the
medical center staff for a picnic lunch at the hospital, located 60
miles east of Los Angeles.
   Bailey was the surgeon who also transplanted a baboon heart into
Baby Fae in 1984. Baby Fae, who suffered the same defect at Eddie,
died 20 days after the controversial surgery.
   Hospital children were invited to share the celebration,
highlighted by clowns, and photos of the surgery were given to
Eddie's parents. One showed the surgical team working over the
infant and the other showed Bailey reaching into a container
holding Eddie's new heart, said hospital spokesman Dick Shafer.
   Since Eddie's surgery, the procedure has become commonplace.
Bailey and his partner, Dr. Steven Gundry, have performed more than
60 transplants in young children.
   Eddie must take anti-rejection drugs twice a day but has enjoyed
a dramatic improvement in his health during the past year, Mrs.
Anguiano said. He now has sufficient resistance to fight off colds
with over-the-counter drugs.
   Eddie is scheduled to start kindergarten next year.
   After pre-school he plays with cousins at his grandmother's
house.
   ``He's a bully. He likes to take toys away'' from other
children, Mrs. Anguiano said. ``If they don't give it to him then
he gets really mad and pinches them.''
   Privacy remains a concern for Eddie's parents. Mrs. Anguiano
refused to identify the city where the family lives, saying only
that it is in San Bernardino County.
   Tuesday's celebration was Eddie's fifth in a week, counting a
birthday party last Friday. Although Eddie likes the parties, he
doesn't really understand what they are about, Mrs. Anguiano said.
   ``I talk to him once in a while about the operation and the
little scars on his chest,'' she said. ``He doesn't quite
understand, but hopefully when he gets a little older he will.''

   A killer earthquake and a Stephen King horror
story gripped television viewers and grabbed high ratings in the
newest network ratings battle.
   Part two of the death and destruction in NBC's ``The Big One''
finished third in A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings released Tuesday. Part
one of the evil, child-murdering entity in Stephen King's ``It''
was fifth.
   Alongside murder and mayhem, the top 10 was dominated by public
sniping. ABC's season premiere of its occasional ``Barbara Walters
Special'' series finished sixth, featuring actress Delta Burke's
teary rekindling of her bitter feud with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason
and Harry Thomason, producers of her hit situation comedy
``Designing Women.''
   For the sixth time in the 9-week-old season, NBC's ``Cheers''
was television's most-watched show.
   In overall network ratings, NBC was first with a 13.4 average.
ABC was second with 13.3. CBS had 11.9. Each ratings point
represents 931,000 television homes.
   The CBS weekly newsmagazine ``60 Minutes'' was the No. 2 show.
NBC's ``A Different World'' finished fourth.
   ``Empty Nest'' on NBC ranked seventh. ABC's ``Roseanne'' and
``America's Funniest People'' finished eighth and ninth,
respectively.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was No. 10.
   For the 45th consecutive week, ABC and Peter Jennings won the
network news battle. ABC's average was 11.2. CBS and Dan Rather and
NBC and Tom Brokaw tied with 9.7.

   An Associated Press article based on
information from the Pentagon erroneously reported Monday that
three National Guard combat brigades from Georgia, Mississippi and
Louisiana had been called to active duty.
   Pentagon spokesman Major Doug Hart said Monday the combat units
were called up as part of a broad activation of reserves. On
Tuesday, he said he had misunderstood the makeup of units called up
and the three brigades were not among them.
   The brigades are the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of
Georgia, the 155th Armored Brigade of Mississippi and the 256th
Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana. The Pentagon had said
previously they would be activated, but no specific date has been
announced.

   Government supporters and foes fought
with bombs, iron rods and sticks in Dhaka and at least 13 other
cities during a daylong strike Tuesday and at least 260 people were
injured, witnesses and news reports said.
   Two big opposition parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party called the strike to force President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad to resign.
   A senior police official said several people were detained for
rioting, but he refused to give a number or to allow his name to be
used.
   Police burst tear gas shells and repeatedly fired in the air to
disperse protesters throughout Dhaka, the capital city of 7 million
people, witnesses said. At least 60 people were injured in
political frays, including five who suffered bullet wounds, they
said.
   The strike was the seventh opposition-sponsored shutdown the
past month. It closed businesses and halted traffic in Dhaka and
several other cities, the opposition claimed. Government offices
were open, but few people went to them.
   At least 40 people were injured in political fighting in the
port of Chittagong and at least 100 in Rajshahi, 120 miles
northwest of Dhaka,, the United News of Bangladesh news agency
said.
   The Bengali-language daily Sangbad said an additional 60 people
were injured in clashes in 11 other towns.
   Abdus Salam Talkdar, secretary-general of the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, told reporters three people raided
the house of party president Khaleda Zia on Tuesday. He said Mrs.
Zia was not at home, but the attackers assaulted her son and two
servants.
   He said one raider demanded to know where she was and said
repeatedly: ``I will kill her.''
   Ershad, a 60-year old former army general, seized power in a
bloodless coup eight years ago. He has promised elections next
year, but the opposition has sworn to boycott all elections under
Ershad. They say he must first step down and appoint a caretaker
government.
   Ershad left for the Maldives on Tuesday for a summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.

   Iraq is ``casing'' American military
installations in the Middle East as possible terrorist targets if
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, a former CIA official said
Tuesday.
   ``I don't believe the Iraqis are going to unleash that
capability against the Americans at this time,'' said Vincent M.
Cannistraro. ``But they are certainly preparing themselves,
positioning themselves to do so once the situation changes.''
   He spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the National Strategy
Information Center Inc., a private group concerned primarily with
Soviet intelligence activities.
   Iraq, he said, would like to split Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Morocco away from the U.S.-led coalition trying to liberate Kuwait
from Iraq.
   Beyond that, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is ``casing American
targets,'' preparing for terrorist attacks against U.S. military
and other official installations, Cannistraro said.
   ``They are preparing for an operation in the event a green light
is given to conduct one,'' Cannistraro said. ``That means having a
good book on the targets. ... They are preparing themselves.''
   He said Saddam would probably order the attacks ``at the time an
outbreak of hostilities in the Gulf occurs.''
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to address the substance
of Cannistraro's remarks. ``He's a retired agency officer who is
entitled to express his own opinion,'' Mansfield said.
   And FBI spokesman Nestor Michnyak said it was ``not the policy
of the FBI to confirm or deny any public statements made by a
private citizen.''
   Cannistraro, chief of operations and analysis at the CIA's
Counter Terrorism Center for two years until his resignation in
September, said he didn't think the Soviets, who had close ties to
Baghdad, were involved with the operation he described.
   ``All the signals are the Soviets are professing a new religion
on the subject of terrorism,'' Cannistraro said.
   A specialist on the Middle East, Cannistraro also served as a
special assistant for intelligence at the Defense Department and
director of intelligence programs at the National Security Council.
   He said Iraq is providing weapons, money and information to
various groups, including one headed by Palestinian radical Abul
Abbas as well as the Iraqi-backed Arab Liberation Front.
   Cannistraro said most terrorist incidents are sponsored by four
countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria. In trying to avert
bloodshed, he said, ``we are unsuccessful more than we are
successful.''
   He said there is some evidence that Iraq was involved in the
assassination last month of Egypt's parliamentary speaker, though
the attack probably was carried out by the small Islamic Jihad
movement in the country.

   Lawmakers agreed Tuesday to free all
Germans remaining in Iraq and Kuwait as a gesture that President
Saddam Hussein said should encourage dialogue and avert war in the
Persian Gulf.
   The National Assembly voted to approve Saddam's recommendation
that the Germans be allowed to leave in response to recent
statements by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressing the need for
a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
   German government spokesman Hans Klein, in Paris, said his
nation did not conduct any ``special negotiations with Iraq - open
or covert.''
   Earlier this week Iraq said all foreigners would be set free
between Dec. 25 and March 25, but Information Minister Latif
Nassiyif Jassim indicated Monday that some might be allowed to
leave earlier.
   A Dutch company reported Tuesday that 122 Dutch, Belgian and
British nationals who had just completed a dredging project for the
Iraqi government would soon leave.
   And the government indicated it would free an unspecified number
of other Europeans in response to visits by a Swiss delegation and
a group of European parliament members headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen
of France.
   The Western allies have accused Saddam of trying to use the
hostage issue to try to split the alliance assembled against him
after the Aug. 2 occupation of Kuwait.
   Parliament speaker Saadi Mahdi Saleh said there were 124 Germans
remaining in Iraq and Kuwait. No specific arrangements were made
for their departure.
   Only one of the National Assembly members, Jamil Sheik Issa,
voted against the measure Tuesday. He declined to give a reason to
reporters.
   At least 10 of the ``guests,'' as Iraq calls foreigners held
since the invasion of Kuwait, spoke during the 90-minute debate.
They endorsed the president's recommendation, citing the German
government's recent statements concerning the gulf crisis.
   They said the release of the Germans would encourage European
countries and the United States to show willingness to avert war
and become involved in negotiations.
   In Paris, German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher said:
``I believe we should appreciate above all that the hostages are to
be freed.''
   Wolfgang Boetsch, another German politician, said the release
would not separate Germany from the international alliance opposed
to Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. And Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of a
German opposition party, said freeing the Germans was a step toward
resolving the conflict without military intervention.
   White House spokesman Marlon Fitzwater, in Paris with President
Bush, said Baghdad's move was another effort to chisel away
international solidarity against Iraq.
   ``Our answer is simply, `Sorry, it won't work,''' said
Fitzwater.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as saying Iraq
should ``encourage Mr. Kohl and the people of Germany for taking
further stances that distinguish between the interests of Germany
and the interests of the callers of war and hegemony.''
   The president also noted that German experts have contributed to
many development projects in Iraq.
   Baghdad radio quoted Saddam as saying ``the Arabs have always
maintained good relations with the German people and never in the
past did the Germans do anything against the Arabs.''
   Saddam allowed 120 Germans to go home with former West German
chancellor Willy Brandt earlier this month. The National Assembly
vote followed a pattern established with the release of French and
Bulgarian hostages.
   Kohl told President Bush on Sunday that there is still a chance
for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. ``Whoever believes the
problem can be solved militarily must consider not only the
mission, but the end of the whole undertaking,'' Kohl said.

   An aide to one of the ``Keating Five''
senators questioned the accounts of two of the other lawmakers
Tuesday, underscoring rifts among the men being investigated for
their conduct in helping savings and loan owner Charles H. Keating
Jr.
   The fourth day of the Ethics Committee hearings lacked the
emotion and drama of the two previous sessions, when the five
senators defiantly denied wrongdoing and appealed for exoneration
that could save their careers.
   But the testimony by an aide to Arizona Republican John McCain
underlined the deep differences between him, Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. Other subjects of the
inquiry are Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   McCain and DeConcini have markedly different versions of what
they discussed in advance of a meeting on Keating's behalf with the
nation's top thrift regulator on April 2, 1987.
   And Riegle contends he played no role in organizing that meeting
- which he did not attend - while McCain's aide said she and her
boss believe Riegle played a key role in setting it up.
   The committee of three Republicans and three Democrats is to
determine whether the senators pressured regulators to go easy on
Keating because of the $1.3 million that he and associates gave to
the lawmakers' campaigns and political causes.
   Much of the money was given while Keating was battling thrift
regulators and trying to save his failing Lincoln Savings and Loan,
of Irvine, Calif. The federal government seized the institution in
April 1989, and it may cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to cover
the losses.
   The five senators are no longer attending the entire hearings
fulltime. Cranston is in California for treatment of recently
diagnosed prostate cancer. The others tend to appear when their
particular conduct is discussed. DeConcini and McCain were there
Tuesday, and Riegle attended briefly.
   The hearings are to resume Monday after the long Thanksgiving
holiday weekend.
   Gwendolyn van Paasschen, McCain's economics assistant, testified
Tuesday that during discussions before the 1987 meeting with Edwin
J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, ``I
believed ... that Sen. Riegle was involved'' in organizing the
session.
   Riegle told the committee last Friday that he met with Gray a
month before the meeting and suggested Gray meet with senators
concerned about treatment of Lincoln. But he denied organizing the
meeting.
   That session has become crucial to the case, because Gray and
the committee's special counsel contend that during it DeConcini
offered Gray a deal on Keating's behalf. According to Gray,
DeConcini proposed that Keating would issue more home mortgages if
the bank board would waive a rule that limited risky investments
such as those made by Lincoln Savings.
   DeConcini denied in testimony on Monday that any such deal was
offered, and the three other senators present at the meeting -
Cranston, McCain and Glenn - have backed their colleague's version
in earlier letters to Gray.
   Ms. van Paasschen also testified that she believed DeConcini was
trying to coax McCain into meeting with regulators, ``because
McCain was a Republican'' and involving him would show the
intervention was bipartisan if news of the meeting leaked out.
   She added that publicity about the meeting would be more
embarrassing for McCain than DeConcini because McCain had received
more money from Keating - $112,000 to $48,000.
   DeConcini reminded the committee Monday that McCain issued a
press release in July 1989 that he attended the meeting with Gray
of his own free will.
   Ms. van Paasschen's testimony also highlighted markedly
different accounts by McCain and DeConcini of their preparation for
the April 2 meeting.
   The McCain staff member said she understood from her boss and a
DeConcini staff member that the two senators agreed to a limited
agenda that did not involve any negotiations on Keating's behalf in
his battle with the regulators.
   She said she and McCain believed the session would be ``a simple
inquiry on behalf of a constituent. We were not concerned about Mr.
Keating but about the 2,000 employees in the Phoenix area'' of
Lincoln's parent company, the Keating-owned American Continental
Corp.
   DeConcini has denied that he agreed to limit the discussion. His
lawyer, James Hamilton, read from an earlier McCain statement to
the committee in which McCain said he did not believe there was a
``binding agreement'' between the two senators prior to the
meeting.
   DeConcini told the committee Monday, ``I had no word with Sen.
McCain about what would be offered and what not.''
   In afternoon testimony Tuesday, McCain administrative assistant
Chris Koch said his enraged boss threw Keating out of his office at
a March 24, 1987, meeting.
   McCain had learned shortly before Keating arrived that the
Lincoln owner was calling the senator a ``wimp'' because he was
refusing to negotiate with regulators on the businessman's behalf,
Koch said.
   Koch said the senator, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, told
Keating he ``didn't spend 5{ years of his life in a prisoner of war
camp to have his courage or integrity questioned.''
   The aide quoted McCain as telling Keating, ``I can't go in and
break arms and legs for you. I can go in and see you're treated
fairly.''
   Koch said the senator's desire that a constituent be treated
fairly prompted him to attend two April meetings with regulators
``despite Charlie Keating not because of Charlie Keating.''

   A winter storm roared through the mountains of Idaho and Wyoming
and down through Utah Tuesday.
   The storm produced as much as 10 inches of snow in Yellowstone
National Park, and mountain resorts in Utah received from 6 to 12
inches of new snow with an accumulation of 24 inches expected by
midday Wednesday.
   Colorado's flirtation with Indian summer was expected to break
off again Tuesday night with a winter-like storm blowing into
western Colorado just in time for the start of the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   The weather system was expected to bring gusty wind, blowing
snow and sharply cooler temperatures to the state after a long
stretch of unseasonably warm weather.
   A winter storm watch was in effect for Wednesday for the higher
elevations of the Cascade and Olympic mountains of Washington with
as much as a foot of new snow expected.
   At midday, snow was falling across the Rockies and over
northeast New York state. Showers reached along the central coast
of Oregon and the lower elevations of the Rockies.
   Light rain fell over parts of Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska,
Kansas, Oklahoma and the northern coast of California.
   Wind gusts to 30 mph and 40 mph whipped across the Plains, with
gusts up to 66 mph reported at Guadelupe Pass in western Texas.
   Snowfall amounts included 3 inches at Butte, Mont., 2 inches at
Austin, Nev., as well as 1 inch at Ely, Nev., and Helena, Mont.
   Tuesday's low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 18 degrees
at St. Johnsbury, Vt.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 27 at
McCall, Idaho, to 90 degrees at McAllen, Texas.

   A group of 45 House Democrats asked a federal
judge Tuesday to block any order from President Bush for a U.S.
attack on Iraqi forces unless he first obtained permission from
Congress.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, also seeks a
declaratory judgment that Bush is required by the war powers clause
of the Constitution ``to seek a declaration of war or other
explicit authorization of Congress'' before launching an attack.
   ``If the president takes it upon himself - as he may at any
moment - to initiate such a war without the unequivocal consent of
Congress, the victim of Iraqi aggression will be, not just Kuwait,
but the Constitution of the United States,'' the lawmakers said in
court papers.
   Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif., who organized the filing of
the lawsuit, said the court action is intended to force Bush to
give lawmakers a chance to debate the wisdom of waging war on Iraq.
   ``We're saying the president of the United States cannot on his
own make that kind of determination,'' Dellums told reporters.
``There are millions of people in this country who have serious
questions about us going to war.''
   Lawyers for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which
represents the lawmakers, asked U.S. District Judge Harold H.
Greene, a liberal appointee of President Carter, to hold a hearing
in 10 days.
   At issue is whether Bush should seek specific authorization from
Congress before launching an attack on Iraqi troops, who invaded
Kuwait in August.
   The war powers clause of the Constitution gives Congress the
power ``to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and
make rules concerning captures on land and water.''
   ``The present confrontation between the United States and Iraq
meets every conceivable test of the applicability of the war powers
clause,'' the lawmakers said in court papers. ``If congressional
consent for offensive military action is not required'' in the
gulf, ``the war powers clause is a dead letter.''
   The lawmakers said that Bush and other spokesmen for his
administration, notably Secretary of State James Baker III, have
repeatedly dodged the question of whether he would seek
congressional authorization before launching an attack.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told reporters that the lawsuit
``involves very complicated questions involving standing to sue,
the executive power, and we will respond completely.''
   ``We will indicate quite clearly what we think the president's
responsibilities are and what limits, if any, exist,'' Thornburgh
said, suggesting the administration would file a hard-line response
to the suit.
   Unlike other recent court challenges to the president's power to
dispatch troops overseas without consulting Congress, the lawsuit
does not rely on the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which Dellums
called ``an extremely weak reed.''
   Michael Ratner, an attorney in the case, said a pure
constitutional challenge gives lawmakers a firm claim that they
have standing to sue.
   In Paris, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White
House would have no comment on ``their right to pursue that legal
remedy,'' and gave the opinion that a challenge based on the War
Powers Resolution would result in a declaration of the
unconstitutionality of the 1973 measure.
   Courts have been loath to rule against a president's use of
military force in previous cases, generally ruling that the cases
presented political questions that cannot be decided by judges.
   But Ratner noted that two federal appellate courts held in
Vietnam War cases that judges could rule on the issue of whether
Congress had authorized the conflict.
   The lawmakers denied their court challenge would undercut Bush's
effort to pressure Iraq with a military buildup into withdrawing
from Kuwait before a shot is fired.
   ``Our country is built on dialogue,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif. and the chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
the constitution.
   Besides Dellums and Edwards, the complaint was signed by 43
Democratic House members. They are:
   Reps. Les AuCoin of Oregon, Jim Bates of California, David E.
Bonior of Michigan, Barbara Boxer of California, William Clay of
Missouri, Cardiss Collins of Illinois, George W. Crockett of

<HEAD>Ultra-Orthodox Win Bills Against Nude Ads and Sabbath Transport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli Parliament gave preliminary
approval Tuesday to two bills that would ban nude advertising and
keep public buses from running on the Jewish sabbath.
   The legislation touched on one of the thorniest social issues in
Israel - the rift between the non-observant Jewish majority and
religious Jews whose political clout outweighs their numbers.
   Both bills cleared by votes of 42 to 38 with two abstentions,
after an abrasive seven-hour debate punctuated by left-wing charges
the laws would violate individual freedoms.
   The bills move to legislative committee and face two more votes
in Parliament before becoming law.
   At one point, Aryeh Eliav of the Labor Party stood up to read
excerpts from biblical psalms that included erotic descriptions of
female nudity.
   Avraham Ravitz of the Torah Flags party interrupted, shouting,
``You are violating the name of God!''
   The ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Party demanded that Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc endorse the two bills in
exchange for an agreement this week to join Shamir's coalition.
   Agudat holds four crucial seats in Shamir's 64-member alliance
in the 120-member Parliament.
   The Agudat party is also demanding passage of a law banning the
sale or pork in Israel because of Jewish dietary laws that forbid
pork consumption.
   The advertising bill would prohibit nudity or partial nudity
``with sexual overtones,'' from appearing on city billboards or bus
stops.
   Religious legislators claim that posters featuring partially
clad models violate Jewish dictates of modest dress for men and
women.
   The transport legislation would tighten restrictions barring
public buses from traveling on Friday nights and Saturday, the
Jewish sabbath. Religious law expressly bans travel on the Sabbath.
   Left-wing legislators argued the bills infringed on the rights
of the 70 percent of Israelis who are not Orthodox Jews.
   Some compared the legislation to the fundamentalist Moslem
edicts of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran.
   ``This is a war of cultures where one side is conducting the
campaign using its political weapons. ... It is an attempt to
impose norms that are alien to the Western world,'' said Dedi
Zucker of the Citizens' Rights movement.
   Menachem Porush of Agudat said his party was only trying to
preserve the Jewish character of Israel.
   ``I don't understand what all the Jihad is about,'' Porush said,
using the Arabic term for holy war.

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein, faced with possible erosion
of support from a key ally, promised to improve the lot of
Palestinians in Kuwait after complaints of Iraqi army harassment
and torture, a senior PLO official said.
   He said Saddam made the pledge last week to a delegation headed
by Yasser Abed Rabbo of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
Executive Committee.
   About 400,000 Palestinian workers and their families live in the
occupied emirate. Most come from Jordan.
   The official, speaking in an interview Monday on condition of
anonymity, refused to say how Saddam would improve Palestinians'
living conditions.
   Abed Rabbo visited Saddam after Palestinians returning to Jordan
assailed ``Iraqi brutality'' against the Palestinian community in
Kuwait.
   ``We were very much mistreated by Iraqi troops,'' said a
46-year-old Palestinian, who quit his job as a professor at Kuwait
University and fled to Jordan.
   ``To get away with their brutal treatment, they accuse us of
collaborating with Kuwaiti citizens against Saddam's regime.
   ``The punishment is beyond expectations. It is either execution
or torture.''
   The professor of political science spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat threw his support behind Saddam early
in the Persian Gulf crisis, on the premise Saddam was the only Arab
leader who could force a solution to the Palestinian problem.
   Three weeks after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, Western diplomatic
sources in Amman claimed a rift had developed in PLO support
because Iraq was mistreating Palestinians in Kuwait. A PLO source
at the time dismissed the claims as ``American propaganda.''
   Another Palestinian, Sami Ibrahim Al-Khalily, 35, described the
situation in Kuwait City as ``complete chaos.''
   Khalily said in an interview that because of their support of
Saddam, Palestinians were also tormented and attacked by Kuwaiti
citizens.
   ``The only way for Palestinians to be safe is by arming
themselves against personal attacks from both the Kuwaiti people
and the Iraqi soldiers,'' said Khalily, who arrived in Amman from
Kuwait this month.
   ``Iraqi troops accuse Palestinians of training Kuwaitis in the
use of arms to resist the army, and soldiers execute any
suspects.''
   He said that in late August, he saw Iraqi troops tying up a
Palestinian man's arms to two cars which drove in opposite
directions.
   ``The man's arms were torn off as his family watched him - not
daring to make a move,'' Khalily said.
   The professor, who arrived in Amman on Thursday, said it was
dangerous for Palestinians to walk unarmed in Kuwait ``because the
army makes trouble for them on the streets.''
   He said Iraqi soldiers harass Palestinian women at checkpoints
inside Kuwait City and often confiscate jewelry and other
valuables.
   Both Khalily and the professor said Palestinian support for
Saddam was declining there.
   ``Now the feeling has changed,'' Khalily said. ``You will not
find many Palestinians there supporting Iraq because they have come
under more brutal treatment by the Iraqis.''
   The PLO official said, ``We were briefed on all of this and we
voiced our concerns over the deteriorating situation to President
Saddam.
   ``We have a lot of problems to address, but most urgently the
serious financial problems of the Palestinian community.''
   He echoed statements by Labor Minister Qaseem Obeidat that
Jordanian-Palestinians lost more than $8 billion in savings and
property since Kuwait's takeover.
   More than 300,000 Jordanians of Palestinian origin lived and
worked in oil-rich Kuwait, contributing hundreds of millions of
dollars for kin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jordan.
   These Palestinians hold Jordanian assports. An additional
100,000 Palestinians in Kuwait hold Egyptian-issued temporary
passports.
   Roughly half of Jordan's 3.4 million people come from
Palestinian families who fled or were driven from their homes in
the 1948 and the 1967 Arab-Israeli wars.

<HEAD>Frozen Waste Falls From Airplane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELKHORN, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A frozen block of human waste that
apparently fell from an airliner ripped through the roof of a
county highway department building, nearly striking a worker,
authorities said.
   Steven Kinney, a mechanic working in the building, said he heard
a loud crash Monday evening and ran into the next room, where he
found blue ice splattered around a tractor and a gaping hole in the
roof.
   The three-pound block of ice narrowly missed Richard Radtke, who
was repairing the tractor's engine.
   ``It sounded like an explosion,'' said Radtke, 55, of Elkhorn.
``It was really loud, I'm tellin' ya. It sounded like something
blew up.''
   Workers called police and gathered some of the ice into a
freezer to back up their story.
   ``The odds are better of winning the lottery than having a piece
of ice crash though the roof, almost killing a guy who's working on
a tractor,'' Kinney said.
   ``It's crazy, this thing. I've never seen a case like this
before,'' said Walworth County Sheriff's Detective Clay Hansen.
   Hansen said the sheriff's department will try to determine which
airline dropped the ice chunk. A piece of the ice will remain
preserved in the department's freezer for investigators to take to
the state's crime lab.
   In spite of Hansen's comment, chunks of ice colored blue by
lavatory disinfectant have fallen to the ground before. The
National Transportatiohn Safety Board warned in August that the
government isn't doing enough to protect airliner engines from the
same effect.
   Airliner toilets are designed to be emptied by crews on the
ground, but occasionally one will leak and the liquid will freeze
on the outside of the fuselage at high altitudes.
   In addition to simply falling to the ground, the ice chunks can
fly into the plane's engines.
   The problem has knocked the engines off two planes in recent
years and caused others to fail. On Feb. 12, an Eastern Airlines
Boeing 727 was forced to shut down one engine on a flight from
Atlanta, Ga., to Sarasota, Fla.
   On Jan. 4, a Northwest Airlines 727 jet flying over Madison,
Fla., lost one engine due to ice from a toilet leak, and a similar
incident tore the engine off an American Airlines 727 over Las
Cruces, N.M., on April 16, 1985, the safety board said. Both planes
landed safely.

   General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union will cooperate in the nation's most extensive program
to combat repetitive motion injuries, Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole said Tuesday.
   One hundred thirty-eight plants and an estimated 302,000 workers
will take part in an effort similar to those being undertaken by
Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. last year and earlier this year,
the Labor Department said.
   The GM pact is part of a settlement of government charges that
the nation's largest automaker violated safety and health rules at
plants in Trenton, N.J., and Oklahoma City, Okla. GM will pay
$360,000 in fines for the alleged violations.
   A spokeswoman said GM would have no immediate comment.
   Repetitive motion traumas, also referred to as cumuluative
trauma disorders, are disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous
systems caused by repetitive jotions or exertion over extended
periods.
   Painful and sometimes crippling, they range from back injuries
to a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist to various tendon
ailments. They comprise about 48 percent of the workplace injuries
for which the department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration keeps records.
   Preventive measures include redesigning work stations to better
accommodate the body by, for example, adjusting workbench heights.
Also, devices can be used to prevent excessive lifting or similar
exertions. Tools and training can be redesigned.
   Under the agreement, the company and union agreed to:
   -Convene annual meetings for six years to discuss progress being
made in combating the disorders.
   -Analyze jobs at each plant with potential repetitive-motion
hazards and devise ways to lessen the risk, including workplace
redesign where feasible.
   -Training of all emplpyees in avoiding repetitive motion trauma.
   -Provide medical attention to allow early detection and
treatment. The company would move workers falling victim to injury
to other jobs.
   -Establish procedures for resolving disputes over whether
particular jobs pose a risk.
   -Keep records of injuries and illnesses caused by repetitive
motion.
   Others unions representing GM workers are expected to reach
separate agreements, the department said.

   Police say the rape-murder of a young woman rivals
New York's Central Park jogger case in savagery, but they and
residents say it does not reflect the housing project where the
victim and some of her alleged attackers lived.
   ``Franklin Field is not a bad place,'' said Thelma Smith, an
18-year resident of the Franklin Field housing complex, adjacent to
where the battered body of Kimberly Rae Harbour was found the day
after Halloween.
   ``It's as nice as any other place to live,'' she said Tuesday.
``We don't have many problems around here. There's a lot more
places with a lot more bad things happening, but you never hear
about it.''
   The 26-year-old woman's body was found in a playing field next
to the project in the city's Dorchester section where she lived
with her 7-year-old daughter.
   ``She was attacked and a mutilated body was found in Franklin
Field, raped and stabbed, stabbed over a hundred times, beat with a
bottle, raped repeatedly,'' said Dave Rodman, spokesman for the
Suffolk County District Attorney's office.
   Eight teen-agers were arraigned in the case Monday. Three were
ordered held without bail. Five juveniles were placed in the
custody of the state Division of Youth Services.
   Police Detective Peter O'Malley said at the arraignment that a
bloodied tree limb, broken glass and Harbour's clothing were found
at the scene. Some police investigators said she was robbed of only
$1 and her coat.
   Police Superintendent Joseph Saia declined to say Tuesday which
of the suspects actually live in the housing project.
   Saia said he wanted to avoid giving the project a stigma of
being laden with crime, and credited residents with assisting in
the investigation.
   ``This was a result of community help, which we used to obtain
probable cause and gave us enough to make the arrests,'' he said.
``We have several witnesses and people who made statements, and we
were able to put it together.''
   Smith, 63, chairwoman of the Franklin Field Task Force, denied
there were any street gangs in the neighborhood and said the
arrested youths often participated in activities at the local youth
center.
   ``I never had no trouble out of them,'' she said. ``They were
respectful to me. Whenever I would go to the teen center and if
they were talking they would stop and say `Hi, Ms. Smith.'''
   Kevin Sims, 19, said he often leaves the complex in search of
something to do.
   ``Sometimes, you know, they get bored and go and do something
stupid,'' Sims said of neighborhood youths. ``Most of the time when
something bad happens it's because of people from outside. They
come and start trouble. I don't know if that's the case or not.''
   Lt. Detective Edward McNelley, head of the homicide squad, said
Tuesday that Harbour was accompanied by a friend, Laura Peterson,
when the two were attacked on Oct. 31.
   ``The group spilt in two, half went after one and the other half
went after the other and after they finished robbing (Peterson)
they all went after Ms. Harbour,'' McNelley said.
   McNelley said Peterson was struck at least once but ``she fled,
she got away from them and fled.''
   McNelley and other police officials said Monday that the murder
had similarities to the New York Central Park ``wilding'' incident
in 1989 in which several youths roamed the park, randomly attacking
joggers and strollers. A 29-year-old banker was raped, beaten and
left for dead, and spent several weeks in a coma.
   But Saia steered away from such comparisons.
   ``We knew this was an isolated case,'' he said.
   Harbour's 7-year-old daughter, Tatiana, has moved to Richmond,
Va., to live with relatives.

   Harold ``Kim'' Philby, the late British double
agent who fed key secrets to the Soviet Union for 26 years, was
among the master Soviet spies honored on Tuesday with their
portraits on postage stamps.
   The Stamp Publishing and Trading Center of the government's
Communications Ministry issued five new stamps honoring ``Soviet
intelligence officers,'' the official Tass news agency said.
   The government has celebrated its spies before on stamps, but it
appeared to be the first time a Western defector was singled out.
   Philby died in May 1988 in Moscow, 25 years after he defected
from Britain following the discovery that he was a KGB spy.
   For 26 years before that, he turned over damaging secrets to the
Soviets while working for Britain's MI6 intelligence agency. He
told a Soviet interviewer before his death he had considered the
Soviet Union his home since the 1930s.
   The other spies to be portrayed in stamps were Col. Rudolf Abel,
who was captured in the United States and exchanged in 1962 for
Gary Powers, pilot of the downed U-2 spy plane; Konon Molodyi,
captured in England in 1961 and swapped for British spy Greville
Wynne, and Stanislav Vaupshasov, a highly decorated agent in
German-occupied Byelorussia during World War II.
   Tass identified the fourth only as I. Kudrya, an underground
resistance fighter. He was not mentioned in standard biographical
references.

<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder urged Virginia
Military Institute Tuesday to admit women, ending more than a year
of silence on the state-supported school's 151-year tradition of
allowing male cadets only.
   ``I believe that no person should be denied admittance to a
school supported by state funds solely because of his or her race
or gender,'' Wilder said at a news conference.
   The governor urged the school to settle a federal lawsuit in
which the U.S. Justice Department is challenging VMI's admissions
policy as unconstitutional. Wilder also said the ``possibility
could arise'' that he would withhold state funds to the school if
the policy is not changed.
   Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, who has been defending VMI,
told reporters later the governor is ``the ultimate architect'' of
state policy and she is ready to cooperate with him.
   But Joseph M. Spivey III, president of the VMI Board of
Visitors, said the Lexington school would continue to fight the
lawsuit.
   ``The board believes that VMI's mission, policy and system of
education are on sound constitutional ground and that the Justice
Department's attempt to force VMI to abandon those principles is
misguided,'' Spivey said in a statement.
   ``We have just been abandoned by our commander-in-chief,'' said
Robert Chenery, a senior cadet from Chesapeake. Chenery called
Wilder's move a ``wee bit of a knife between the shoulder blades''
since the governor told cadets at their May graduation that the
school should decide its policies.
   Sylvia Clute, a Richmond lawyer who founded Friends of VMI for
Equality, hailed Wilder's announcement. Ms. Clute said her
daughter, a medic with the Army Reserve, has been ordered to
prepare for possible shipment to the Middle East.
   ``I faced the prospect of my daughter going to war while the
state of Virginia was denying her admission to a military
college,'' Ms. Clute said.
   Wilder said he decided to speak out because U.S. District Judge
Jackson L. Kiser refused this month to dismiss him as a defendant
in the lawsuit that is set for trial in April. The governor said he
is not appealing that ruling so he had to give his response to the
lawsuit.
   The Justice Department filed its lawsuit last winter on behalf
of an unidentified northern Virginia girl who said she wanted to
attend VMI.
   VMI and The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., are the only two
state-supported military schools in the country that bar women
cadets. The nation's military academies began admitting women years
ago.

   A 16th-century book of proverbs by Desiderius
Erasmus that traced the history of famous sayings like ``God helps
those who help themselves'' sold Tuesday at Sotheby's for $975,000.
   The volume, titled ``Adagia'' (``Proverbs'') and printed in
1523, was the personal copy of the Dutch humanist scholar and
contained more than 2,500 lines of his writing in which he
annotated, revised and added to his work.
   The book was sold by an anonymous collector in Europe and bought
for another European collector by Nico Israel, an Amsterdam dealer.
   By the time Erasmus died in 1536 his proverbs had welled from
818 in the first edition of his works dated 1500 to more than 4,000
in the 10th edition, in pursuit of his aim to make the wisdom of
the past widely available.
   Among the proverbs were ``One swallow doesn't make a summer,''
``Looking a gift horse in the mouth'' and ``Blowing one's own
trumpet,'' which he tracked to their sources in Greek and Latin
classical literature.
   ``The book became a key work of the Renaissance and every
scholar had to have a copy,'' said Sotheby's manuscript expert,
Susan Wharton.
   ``Erasmus's idea of jotting down aphorisms, maxims, proverbs and
witty sayings, which he instructed his pupils to follow, has
persisted to our own time,'' she said.

<HEAD>State to Try Zhivkov for Misappropriation of Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Communist leader Todor Zhivkov
will face trial on charges of misappropriation of funds and abuse
of power, Bulgaria's prosecutor general announced Tuesday.
   Zhivkov, 78, ruled Bulgaria for 35 years, but has been under
house arrest since he was ousted last year by reform-minded
Communists.
   Prosecutor General Martin Gounev told the state BTA news agency
that Zhivkov would be tried for misappropriation of $3.7 million.
   Gounev gave no date for the trial, but said it would be held
soon.
   Zhivkov's right-hand man, Milko Balev, is also to face trial for
the misappropriation of funds, BTA reported.
   The investigation against Zhivkov and Balev was completed in
July, but the defense had asked for a delay of his trial to give it
time to study more than 100 volumes of evidence.
   Zhivkov has admitted he made mistakes but has denied committing
crimes.
   The announcement came as public pressure mounted on the
all-Socialist government of Andrei Lukanov to resign. The Socialist
Party, successor to Zhivkov's Communist Party, won a majority in
the June elections and holds 210 of the 400 seats in Parliament.
   But Lukanov has been unable to push his economic reform program,
which includes steep price hikes, through Parliament. The
legislature is to vote on the controversial package Thursday.
   Lukanov has said he will resign if it is not passed.
   Because of deadlocks in Parliament, Lukanov has been unable to
introduce reforms necessary to turn around the shortage-plagued
economy.
   The opposition Union of Democratic Forces issued a statement
Tuesday supporting a call by the trade union confederation Podkrepa
for a general strike next week if Lukanov's government does not
resign before then.
   ``We can no longer hold in check people's discontent,'' BTA
quoted the statement as saying.
   However, the statement said a final decision on calling a
general strike would be made after Thursday's Parliament session.
   University students have said they plan to organize a human
chain around Parliament by Wednesday if Lukanov's government does
not resign.

<TEXT>
   President Najibullah of Afghanistan, on a surprise
visit that stirred rumors of a new peace initiative, met Tuesday
with several Afghan exiles, his spokesman said.
   Presidential spokesman Sarwar Yourish declined to further
identify who Najibullah met. He would not say whether they were
representatives of the Afghan opposition or where the meetings were
taking place.
   Najibullah arrived Monday for what was announced to be a
four-day stay in Geneva, seat of the U.N. headquarters in Europe
and main site of the U.N.-sponsored talks that resulted in the 1988
agreement on the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from the embattled
country.
   Unofficial reports from Kabul, the Afghan capital, speculated
that he would try to launch a new attempt to reach a settlement
with Afghan guerrilla leaders. The Soviet news agency Tass quoted
circles close to the Afghan mission in Geneva that he would
``probably'' meet opposition representatives.
   Sources close to some fundamentalist guerrilla groups said
Najibullah left Kabul on the advice of his associates because his
personal safety could no longer be guaranteed.
   Rebel sources said that guerrilla commanders launched
coordinated attacks Monday on Afghan government targets in three
provinces surrounding Kabul. A member of Hezb-e-Islami, the most
radical group in the Moslem guerrilla alliance, said the purpose of
the operation was to take Kabul.
   Najibullah's spokesman, questioned about the various reports,
referred a reporter to a news conference the president scheduled
for Wednesday.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up
Kabul's Communist government from attack by the Moslem guerrillas.
The Soviets pulled out in 1989 but still send military aid to
Kabul.

   The Angolan government and U.S.-backed
UNITA rebels are close to reaching a cease-fire to end their
15-year-old civil war, the chief mediator at their peace talks said
Tuesday.
   After five days of negotiations, the two sides reached agreement
on 80 percent of a cease-fire document proposed by the Portuguese
mediating team, State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said.
   He said no date was fixed for signing a cease-fire. But he did
not rule out the possibility of an accord at the next round of
negotiations scheduled for before January.
   Durao Barroso told a news conference a number of key issues
remained to be resolved.
   ``We are climbing a very high mountain,'' he said, ``and the
last few meters (yards) are the most difficult.''
   The meeting in this coastal resort 16 miles west of the
Portuguese capital of Lisbon was the fifth between the Angolan
government and UNITA, or the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, in Portugal since April.
   The two delegations focused on the cease-fire document, but also
discussed a second paper dealing with introduction of multiparty
democracy in Angola.
   Durao Barroso said the complex question of integrating the two
armies was not discussed at the Estoril talks.
   He said both sides had agreed on a series of steps to implement
the cease-fire, beginning with the cessation of hostilities and the
confinement of armed forces in predetermined control zones.
   Both sides have accepted international verification of the
cease-fire, but differences remain on the eventual role of the
United Nations, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Durao Barroso said the Angolan government had accepted a UNITA
demand for recognition as a legitimate political force, but added
divergences existed over details.
   In Paris on Monday, rebel leader Jonas Savimbi expressed
optimism that an accord was near.
   ``A way is now open, nothing more is going to block the
process,'' Savimbi told journalists after a meeting with Portuguese
Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva in the French capital.
   Delegations from the United States and the Soviet Union
attending the Estoril talks as observers. Durao Barroso said their
presence had greatly helped the talks.
   The Angolan civil war is one of the last Cold War regional
conflicts. Both superpowers continue to supply arms to their allies
in Angola.
   UNITA has been fighting the Soviet-backed Angolan government
since the southern African nation gained independence from Portugal
in 1975.
   According to government figures, more than 350,000 people have
died in the conflict.

   A former Marine who is now a
circuit judge doesn't hesitate to throw the book at a defendant,
especially when a defendant tries throwing the book at the judge.
   A man accused of rape lost his temper in court Monday when Judge
Walter Colbath refused to reduce his bond to let him get out of
jail before his January trial.
   Defendant Byron Bryant picked up a copy of the courtroom-drama
bestseller ``Presumed Innocent'' and threw it at Colbath, hitting
him on the shoulder.
   Startled but unhurt, Colbath ruled Bryant in contempt, and the
defendant shot back some profanity.
   Colbath ruled Bryant in contempt again. Bryant swore again.
   That exchange continued until Bryant, 23, was slapped with his
fifth contempt of court citation and removed by Palm Beach County
deputies.
   ``The guy just lost it,'' the judge said later. ``Up until that
point, he had been behaving himself.''
   Back in court Tuesday, Colbath found Bryant guilty of three
counts of contempt and sentenced him to consecutive terms of five
months and 29 days on each count. The number of counts was reduced
because of appeals court precedent for people who yell at judges in
court.
   But Colbath agreed to a defense request for a speedier trial and
reset the case for Dec. 3. Bryant already has been in custody for
almost a year.
   The judge wasn't concerned about the flying book incident.
``I've had guys throw a lot more dangerous missiles at me,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Premier Bob Rae, leader of Ontario's newly
elected left-wing government, opened the provincial legislature's
new session Tuesday with few specifics for a nervously awaiting
business community to ponder.
   Rae repeated his New Democratic Party's campaign promises to
introduce legislation on car insurance, increase the minimum wage
and support laid-off workers. He also declared a moratorium on new
nuclear power plants.
   But the only figure in the speech, read by Lt. Gov. Lincoln
Alexander, was $602 million for a public works project to repair
roads, schools and government buildings, a plan he said would
create critically needed jobs.
   Rae, whose party won 73 of the 130 seats in the legislature in
Sept. 6 elections, said: ``My government recognizes that it assumes
office with great expectations and that not all of these
expectations can be met.''
   Political observers say the NDP won not so much because
Ontarians wanted a socialist government but because of a funding
scandal involving the Liberals and because Liberal Premier David
Peterson decided to call an election two years early after his
pollsters told him he would be a shoo-in.
   During the campaign, the NDP promised programs that would cost
more than $1.7 billion. Once in office, the Rae government found
itself faced with a $2.1 billion deficit left by the outgoing
Liberals.
   Since its founding in 1961, the New Democrats have formed
governments in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the
Yukon territory. But their coming to power in Ontario, Canada's
richest and most populous province, made for some sleepless nights
for the business community.
   Rae has tried to calm fears that he will try to spend and tax
his way out of Canada's recession. Business seems to have taken a
wait-and-see attitude.
   ``To come in here after six weeks and announce, whammo, we're
going to spend here and spend there. ... That would be
irresponsible,'' the premier told reporters just before his speech.
   The speech made no mention of the minimum corporate tax and
inheritance tax promised by the NDP and feared by business.
   Among other measures, Rae said his government would increase the
minimum wage from $4.60 an hour to 60 percent of the average
industrial wage - or $5.70 to $6.06 an hour.

<HEAD>BST Review Taking Longer Than Expected</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Review of a controversial milk-increasing
hormone is taking longer than expected and probably won't be
completed by next spring as originally planned, a Food and Drug
Administration official said Tuesday.
   ``The sheer amount of data is more than we expected'' and is
responsible for the delay, said Gerald B. Guest, director of the
FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.
   The hormone is bovine somatotropin, or BST. In August, the
agency publiished a review of 120 scientific studies to support its
contention that the hormone is safe for humans to ingest.
   All cows' milk contains small amounts of the hormone, which cows
produce naturally. It is digested like any protein, the FDA says.
   Administration of the hormone, produced by genetic engineering
techniques, can increase milk production by 10 percent to 25
percent.
   Some dairy organizations and consumer activists have opposed use
of the hormone on the grounds that its safety in long-term use
remains in doubt and the last thing dairy farmers need is something
to improve production of a commodity in surplus supply like milk.
Some states have forbidden use.
   Four companies have applied to the FDA for permission to sell
the hormone.
   The current review is aimed at determining whether the hormone
is safe for cows. In August, the agency said it expected to finish
in the spring of 1991.
   That deadline, Guest said, ``is going to slip a little.''
   Asked if the review would last into 1992, he replied, ``I hope
not, but there's always that possibility.''
   The deadline slippage was first revealed in remarks by Guest at
a dairy industry symposium on Monday and reported in the Milwaukee
Sentinel on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's political rivals are
trying to persuade voters that eastern Germany is a time bomb set
to explode weeks after the national elections on Dec. 2.
   Experts say that is true, to some extent: Thirty days after the
vote, the former nation's difficult economic road will begin a deep
dip.
   A social expert for the opposition Social Democrats said Tuesday
that at least 1 million people are holding postdated layoff notices
that will not kick in until next year.
   Rudolf Dressler said the party, trailing badly in most polls to
Kohl's Christian Democrats, compiled the information from industry
councils and personnel offices in the former nation.
   An independent economist agreed that hundreds of thousands of
people still working nevertheless have already received layoff
notices effective early next year.
   The Social Democrats' claim was their latest effort to persuade
voters that Kohl is covering up an impending economic disaster that
will hurt eastern Germans more than they realize, and force their
wealthy western neighbors to pay higher taxes because of it.
   Such charges have failed to erode Kohl's status as the man most
likely to win the first united German elections since 1933.
   It is clear, however, that former East Germany is only in the
early stages of a difficult transition from communism to
capitalism.
   Eastern Germans already have seen prices for food and other
necessities, kept artificially low by the Communists, zoom to
Western levels, even as their salaries have remained about
one-third of their wealthier neighbors.
   In January, many of the remaining subsidies also will begin to
disappear. Heavy subsidies for public transportation - which allow
eastern Germans to ride subways for only 20 pfennigs (13 cents) a
trip - will be lifted.
   Subsidized rents, some of them only 60 marks a month ($40), will
be allowed to begin rising, and energy costs also are expected to
start climbing.
   Berlin economist Heine Flassbeck, one of the authors of a
comprehensive look at the immediate future of the eastern German
economy, said 500,000 public-sector workers are to be laid off by
April.
   In the private sector, he said, the question of whether trade
with Eastern European nations will break down could affect 500,000
other workers. Many firms say their contracts will run out on Jan.
1 and won't be renewed, Flassbeck said.
   ``There is a certain gray area ... where something like that
could happen, but we have no concrete information,'' he said.
   Right now, eastern Germany officially has 537,000 unemployed
people, a rate of about 6.1 percent.
   But there are almost 2 million people receiving reduced pay at
lower hours under a Bonn-financed program to keep unemployment low.
   Kohl's critics say this is just another form of unemployment
compensation.
   Flassbeck said it is clear that many of the people in this
category likely will lose their jobs next year because they work in
industries most vulnerable to the new Western competiton.
   His independent institute, the German Institute for Economic
Research, and the nation's four other leading economic think tanks
last month published a report that said unemployment could reach
nearly 4 million by the end of next year for a 50 percent jobless
rate.
   Likewise, the costs of cleaning up the environment of one of the
world's most polluted nations, and repairing an infrastructure
largely neglected since World War II, is expected to reach hundreds
of billions of marks.
   The Institute for Economic Research of the World Economic
Archives in Hamburg said Tuesday that the costs of unification
could reach 15 billion marks ($10 billion) next year and that
higher taxes may be necessary.
   Kohl has promised not to raise taxes to pay for unification, but
his chief opponent, Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine, has charged
that he will have no choice.
   The debate mirrors the U.S. presidential election of 1988, when
President Bush based his successful campaign on a promise not to
raise taxes. He recently relented on that stand.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules In Favor of Prosecutor in Christian Brando
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court on Tuesday ruled in favor of
authorities seeking the return of Marlon Brando's daughter from
Tahiti to testify at her brother's trial on charges of killing her
lover.
   But a prosecutor said he will abandon the effort if independent
doctors find Cheyenne Brando is too sick to testify.
   ``We will do nothing to hurt this girl,'' said Deputy District
Attorney Steven Barshop.
   Christian Brando is charged with the slaying of Miss Brando's
Tahitian lover, Dag Drollet, and his trial has been delayed by the
dispute over Cheyenne's testimony.
   Barshop said the ruling by the 2nd District Court of Appeals may
assist prosecutors in persuading French authorities in Tahiti to
arrange an independent psychiatric examination of the 20-year-old
Miss Brando.
   She has twice been hospitalized after suicide attempts in the
past month, and charges against her in the French territory in
connection with Drollet's death have complicated the issue of
whether she would be allowed to leave.
   The appellate court ruled that a lower court judge does have
jurisdiction to issue a ``letter of rogatory,'' an international
document requesting formal assistance from the government of
another country. They referred the case back to Superior Court
Judge Joel Rudof, who had concluded he had no such jurisdiction.
   ``Every court of this state has power to make all orders
necessary for the effective conduct of proceedings before it,''
said the decision.
   Barshop said that if the letter of rogatory is issued,
prosecutors would ask not only for Miss Brando's return but for an
independent psychiatric examination.
   Christian Brando's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, said he also would
like to have Miss Brando examined to prove she is physically and
mentally unable to testify.
   Shapiro said he gave prosecutors a letter Monday from the head
psychiatrist at the Tahiti hospital where Miss Brando is under
treatment, saying that ``her emotional and mental state requires
her continued hospitalization.''
   Although Shapiro expressed a desire to start Christian Brando's
trial soon, all lawyers in the case said further proceedings cannot
move ahead until the appeals court decision becomes final in 30
days.
   Barshop said the district attorney's office has discussed
sending psychiatrists to examine Miss Brando but has no assurances
the French authorities in Tahiti would permit it.
   Miss Brando was seven months pregnant with Drollet's child when
the 26-year-old Tahitian was shot to death at the Brando mansion. A
month later, Miss Brando left for Tahiti where she gave birth to a
son.
   On Nov. 1, Miss Brando was reported to have taken an overdose of
tranquilizers and antidepressant drugs and was hospitalized in a
coma. On Nov. 11, she was again reported hospitalized after trying
to hang herself.

   Minute-by-minute fire records show city
firefighters responded to 411 fires over last month's three-night
Devil's Night period, although the official figure released was 281
blazes.
   Detailed computerized fire-run sheets were released by the city
under Freedom of Information Act requests filed by news
organizations. The records show that in addition to the blazes that
Mayor Coleman A. Young publicly reported for the Oct. 29-31 period,
there were 26 additional rekindled fires and 104 fire runs for
burning leaves, warming fires or blazes in trash bins.
   City Fire Marshal Don Robinson claimed the latter group didn't
count as fires in the official count because they didn't endanger
property. That assessment is based on the counting policy used by
the National Fire Prevention Association.
   Robinson also said Detroit does not count rekindled fires as
separate fires because they start from the same source. Rekindled
fires are ones that flare up after firefighters believe they've
been put out.
   Numerous fires that were not included in the count were
extinguished by police, public works employees and residents.
   Structure fires accounted for 209 of the blazes over the three
days. Seventy-five of those were reported at vacant dwellings.
   The Oct. 29-31 period has been associated with arson in Detroit
since the early 1980s.

   The disgraced pop music duo Milli Vanilli
surrendered their best new artist Grammy Award on Tuesday and
claimed their phony act as lipsyncing front men was a ``pact with
the devil'' that victimized them.
   Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, whose stardom was shattered last
week with the revelation that they never sang on the debut Milli
Vanilli album, said they were seduced into the deceit because they
were poor, young and naive.
   ``You get something, but for that you make a pact with the
devil,'' Pilatus said at a news conference.
   ``We feel really, really sorry about our fans,'' he said. ``We
really love our fans ... We just hope that they understand that we
were young, that we just wanted to live the life the American
way.''
   The pair and manager Carsten Heyn charged that Arista Records
President Clive Davis knew they were faking. Arista has repeatedly
denied the claim. Heyn also said recording industry officials
worldwide knew of the deception.
   The pair presented a videotape of themselves recording the hit
song ``Girl You Know It's True'' in a studio last weekend, but that
was greeted with skepticism and yells from reporters to prove they
really could sing.
   Pilatus belted out a few lines from the song and Morvan joined
in with the rap portion of the tune.
   Trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences
voted Monday to rescind Milli Vanilli's Grammy. The pair held up
their trophies Tuesday and declared they were returning them with
recommendation they go to the real singers.
   Academy president Michael Greene said giving the trophies to the
singers who actually sang was ``not a possibility.''
   Voice coach Seth Riggs, who said his clients include Michael
Jackson, Madonna and Stevie Wonder, gave a testimonial to the duo's
singing abilities, saying they were better than the men who
actually were recorded.
   Pilatus claimed he and Morvan were victimized because they were
living in poverty in a Munich housing project when German producer
Frank Farian offered them the deal. He said that at the time they
even had to steal food.
   Pilatus, who was born in New York and raised in Germany,
described in broken English a growing sense of guilt that came
along with stardom and money.
   ``There was everytime something that we had to lie,'' he said.
``We had very guilty complexes.''
   The album ``Girl You Know It's True'' sold 7 million copies
worldwide and made the two unknowns international stars. Pilatus
and Morvan, a native of the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe, are
both 25.
   Farian last week confirmed growing rumors that the duo did not
sing on the album. It actually featured the voices of vocalists
Johnny Davis, Brad Howell and Charles Shaw. Pilatus said Shaw's
role was minimal and the Grammy really belongs to Davis and Howell.
   The pair also lipsynced through an appearance on February's
Grammy show in Los Angeles when Milli Vanilli was honored as best
new artist of 1989.
   Singing coach Riggs said he was there and that Pilatus and
Morvan were ready to sing but were told to fake it. He did not know
who gave the order. The duo also did not say who it was.
   The duo's attorney, Alan Mintz, supported their claim that they
had pressed the producer to be allowed to actually sing and that
the producer only came forward with the truth because Pilatus and
Morvan were about to.
   Meanwhile, an Oakland woman who bought her son a Milli Vanilli
tape filed a class action lawsuit in state court Monday seeking a
refund for anyone in California who bought the group's recordings
or attended one of their concerts.
   In Illinois, Chicago college student Karen L. Smith on Tuesday
also sued in Cook County Circuit Court, claiming fraud because the
CDs she bought named Pilatus and Morvan as performers.

<TEXT>
   A businessman who has emerged from nowhere
into the spotlight of Poland's presidential campaign is a citizen
of Canada and Peru who claims to have made a fortune bringing cable
TV to the Amazon.
   Candidate Stanislaw Tyminski placed a strong third in the latest
polls for Sunday's election, giving new weight to his attacks on
established political leaders.
   The darkhouse candidate is being investigated for slander for
some of his comments, newspapers are attacking him and questions
abound about the Pole who came home to run for president after
making a fortune in the West.
   According to Bob Spanski, a Tyminski campaign aide in Canada,
the candidate was born in a Warsaw suburb in January 1948. He left
Poland at age 21, first going to Sweden, then arriving nearly broke
in Canada in 1970. He became a Canadian citizen in 1975.
   According to his campaign, he spent the early 1980s in Iquitos,
Peru.
   After a gasoline barge on the Amazon was confiscated, Tyminski
decided that the people of Iquitos needed cable TV, said Frank
Ollie, partner in Tyminski's Toronto computer company, Tranduction.
   ``He got a couple of VCRs from Miami and a couple of tapes and
began going from dwelling to dwelling with a coaxial cable and a
staple gun ... and that grew overnight into a very reputable
company.''
   Tyminski then returned to Canada, where he heads Transduction
and leads the Libertarian Party of Canada.
   Tyminski decided to run for president on a lark, during a visit
to Poland in September to attend to his company and promote a book
of his political and economic ideas, titled ``Sacred Dogs,'' Ollie
said.
   The free-spending 42-year-old was a surprise entrant among the
six candidates who managed to collect 100,000 signatures for a
place on Sunday's ballot for Poland's first free presidential
election.
   A fresh face who said he would apply his business wizardry to
the shattered economy, Tyminski appealed to disenchanted Poles and
played on their admiration of the well-heeled, polished leaders of
the West.
   It didn't seem to matter that his Polish was rusty at best, that
his Peruvian wife spoke no Polish at all, or that he hadn't lived
in Poland for the two decades when Poles struggled to throw off
communism.
   Poland is willing to allow emigrants to keep their citizenship
even if they become citizens of other countries.
   Tyminski's attacks on the familiar politicians have played well.
   ``The anti-inflationary plan threatens to bring civil war,'' he
told audiences struggling under the economic reforms creating high
prices, unemployment and uncertainty. ``The country has been
engulfed by recession; we have neither a government nor a
parliament.''
   Tyminski was largely dismissed as an also-ran until an opinion
poll Friday. It showed his support had nearly doubled, to 17
percent of those who intend to vote, compared with 19 percent for
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and 35 percent for Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa. A second poll Sunday produced similar results.
   In a speech Saturday, Tyminski accused Mazowiecki of betraying
the nation through policies creating recession, inflation,
``poverty and exhaustion (that) pose a threat to national
existence.'' He claimed the government was issuing false statistics
that showed inflation and unemployment to be only half as serious
as they are.
   The charge from the outsider-turned-contender went beyond the
bounds of the normally heated political discourse in Poland's
fledgling democracy.
   ``A Liar or a Fool,'' the pro-Mazowiecki Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper said in a headline Tuesday. ``A week before the
elections, we know as much about Tyminski as he has told about
himself. And from what he says, and how he says it, an image of an
imbalanced individual emerges,'' the newspaper said.
   Attorney General Aleksander Bentkowski ordered a slander
investigation.
   ``I consider the accusation (of national betrayal) to be fully
justified by the attempt to sell our best enterprises to foreign
capitalists,'' Tyminski said during a nationally televised
advertisement Monday.
   He cited an addendum to a draft law on privatizing state
industry, saying the prices were dramatically undervalued.
   But reporters pointed out to Tyminski at a raucous news
conference Tuesday that the numbers he was challenging were
actually the total sales of the companies, not their selling
prices.
   Tyminski - whose replies in Polish and English often seemed
incoherent - would not withdraw his accusation, saying ``it came
from the heart.'' He said Mazowiecki showed ``ignorance of the best
interest of the country in the economic sense.''
   In Iquitos, there is excitement about whether a local woman
might become Poland's first lady. A respected Peruvian news
magazine, Caretas, profiled Tyminski, mentioning a photo in his
former restaurant showing him bare-chested with two live snakes
hanging around his neck.
   Tyminski says he is a Polish ``patriot'' back to stay, at least
until the vote is in.
   ``I am doing everything to win and I cannot think of losing,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury investigating alleged police
corruption has asked to see records from Mayor Coleman Young's
private consulting company, the mayor's lawyer said.
   Attorney Peter Kelley refused to say if the mayor has been
subpoenaed, but said the grand jury subpoenaed records from his
business, Detroit Technology and Investments Inc.
   Federal court briefs filed Monday in the 6th Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals showed the grand jury is investigating the disposition
of $2.4 million from a Detroit police undercover fund.
   Earlier this year, City Auditor Roger Short told the City
Council that a two-year audit of the fund ending June 30, 1987,
found no documentation for $847,500 in expenditures.
   The grand jury again subpoenaed undercover police officer
Sylvester Chapman, who refused at July 18 and Oct. 24 hearings to
disclose what happened to $100,000 to $300,000 from the fund.
   Chapman kept no records of money given to informants, funds he
received under an arrangement with police Chief William Hart, the
records said.
   Chapman faces up to 18 months in prison for refusing to tell the
federal grand jury how he spent the money. He contends that naming
informants would harm future police operations.
   The federal government said in its brief that allowing Chapman
to retreat behind the informer's privilege ``would be tantamount to
giving undercover police officers and their commanding officers a
license to steal.''
   The gran jury was reported to be investigating the police
department and former civilian deputy police chief Kenneth Weiner's
connection to Young's company. No charges have been filed in
connection with the police fund.
   Weiner is on trial on fraud charges in an alleged scheme to bilk
millions of dollars from investors in his and others' companies
that dealt in precious metals.
   The trial, which began in September, is expected to last several
more weeks. Young has been subpoenaed to testify in the trial, but
the mayor's attorney said he doubted Young would take the stand.

   The Conservative Party staggered Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher with lukewarm support Tuesday, forcing her into a
second round of balloting in a fight for leadership of party and
country.
   Mrs. Thatcher fell two votes short of a quick defeat in the
sternest challenge of her 11{ years as party leader. She rejected
calls by some to step down and vowed to battle on in another round
of voting next Tuesday.
   Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, smiling and looking
very much like the winner after the vote by his Conservative
colleagues in the House of Commons, also declared himself ready for
round two.
   ``It is my intention to let my name go forward for the second
ballot,'' a calm and determined Mrs. Thatcher told reporters
outside the British Embassy in Paris, where she was attending a
summit on European security.
   If Mrs. Thatcher loses the leadership of the party, she would be
expected to step down as prime minister. The Conservatives have a
98-seat majority in the 650-seat House.
   The opposition Labor Party moved to capitalize on the turmoil in
Conservative ranks by introducing a motion of no-confidence that is
likely to come to a vote before Tuesday. The motion would bring
down the government if it carries.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris, noted that
Mrs. Thatcher has been the closest ally of the Reagan and Bush
administrations, but said the vote was an internal British matter.
   ``We feel very positive about our relationship with her and with
that country,'' Fitzwater said. ``But beyond that, we really can't
have any comment.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, the longest-serving prime minister in Europe, has
suffered a loss in popularity because of a local services tax that
is widely viewed as favoring the rich. Her government also has been
blamed for high inflation and high interest rates. The
Conservatives have trailed Labor in opinion polls for 16 months.
   Heseltine also focused his campaign on Mrs. Thatcher's attitude
toward Europe, which has caused strains within her party.
   Heseltine, standing hand-in-hand with his wife, Anne, outside
their home, told reporters: ``I am overwhelmed with gratitude to my
parliamentary colleagues who in such large measure have given me
their support.''
   Heseltine forced the issue by winning enough votes to deny Mrs.
Thatcher a first-ballot victory in an unprecedented ballot among
the 372 Conservative members of Parliament.
   Because 16 lawmakers abstained, Mrs. Thatcher needed 206 of the
remaining votes, which would have given her a winning margin of 15
percent out of the total 372-member Conservative caucus, as party
rules stipulate. She received 204 votes to Heseltine's 152.
   In the second round, a simple majority can win, but other
candidates now are free to join the race. If necessary, a third and
final ballot would be held Nov. 29.
   Partisans on each side urged the other to give up. Mrs. Thatcher
faced pressure to resign rather than end her career in defeat.
   ``I suspect she may have polled her maximum number of votes
today,'' said Conservative legislator Ivor Stanbrook, who supported
Heseltine.
   `I am absolutely astonished that he got so many and that so many
of my colleagues should have been so disloyal,'' Conservative
lawmaker Ivan Lawrence said on Sky Television.
   ``The party is obviously in trouble, and there is no point in
hiding it,'' said Teddy Taylor, one of Mrs. Thatcher's most
outspoken supporters in the House. He urged her to continue.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been the Conservative leader since 1975, and
was the only Tory leader in this century to lead her party to three
consecutive election victories - in 1979, 1983 and 1987.
   Despite being embroiled in a fight for her political life, the
woman known as ``the Iron Lady'' changed into a formal gown and
smiled as she went to a summit banquet at Versailles.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, put the best face on the result, saying ``I'm
naturally pleased that I got more than half the parliamentary party
and disappointed that it's not quite enough to win.''
   The pound fell nearly half a cent, from $1.9695 dollars to
$1.9650, following the vote.
   Mrs. Thatcher was to return Wednesday to address the House of
Commons on the summit, and to have her weekly meeting with Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Heseltine, 57, pledged during the six-day campaign to overcome
Tory factionalism to win the next general election in 1992. He
pointed to a flurry of opinion polls that indicated voters were
more enthusiastic about the Conservative Party with him as the
leader.
   A self-made millionaire, Heseltine had been a member of Mrs.
Thatcher's first Cabinet in 1979 as environment secretary, and was
named defense secretary in 1983. He quit, bitterly and abruptly, in
the middle of a Cabinet meeting in January 1986.
   The leadership contest erupted unexpectedly following a European
Community summit meeting in Rome at the end of October, at which
Mrs. Thatcher was once again all alone against the 11 other
leaders. She vociferously rejected an agreement in principle for a
single central bank and single currency for the EC.
   Fed up with such views and her autocratic style, Deputy Prime
Minister Geoffrey Howe quit Nov. 1, then delivered a scathing
resignation speech last week that inspired Heseltine to make the
challenge.

   A European Ariane rocket blasted
off from the northeastern corner of South America Tuesday, carrying
two U.S. telecommunications satellites into outer space.
   The rocket, loaded with GSTAR-4 and SATCOM-C1 satellites, lifted
off at 8:11 p.m. (6:11 p.m. EST) from the Ariane facility here.
   It was the 40th launching of an Ariane rocket since the European
space program began 10 years ago, and the final launch of 1990.
   The rocket deployed the SATCOM-C1 19 minutes after takeoff at an
altitude of 188 miles, and the GSTAR-4 four minutes later at 438
miles high.
   SATCOM-C1 and GSTAR-4 were built by General Electric's
Astrospace Division and launched respectively for GTE Spacenet and
GE American Communications Inc.
   They are expected to remain in service for about 13 years,
providing communications links for the continental United States,
Hawaii and Alaska.
   The launch countdown proceeded in recent days despite a strike
by some workers at the launch facility who did not accept work and
salary conditions agreed upon by four unions.
   Ariane launches resumed in July after a five-month suspension
following the explosion of a rocket less than two minutes after
takeoff in February.
   Two Japanese communications satellites aboard were destroyed. An
investigation showed a clogged pipe was responsible for the
accident, but a French magazine reported the rocket was sabotaged.
The claim was never proven.
   The last launch was last month, when two satellites made by
Hughes were put into orbit.
   The next launch is scheduled for January, when an Ariane will
lift into space two satellites, a Eutelsat-II-F2 for European
telecommunications, and an Italsat-1 for Italy's space agency.
   Arianespace, the commercial branch of the European Space Agency,
plans nine Ariane launches in 1991. It has signed contracts worth
$3 billion to launch 34 more satellites.
   Tuesday's launch used for the first time the Ariane-42P, one of
the six versions of the rocket, which uses two boosters of solid
rocket fuel. The Ariane-42P can place a payload of up to 2.6 tons
into geostationary orbit 22,500 miles above the surface of the
Earth.
   The last several launches have used four strap-on boosters of
liquid fuel.

   A man convicted of murdering three women who
disappeared more than a year ago and whose bodies have never been
found was sentenced Tuesday to four life prison terms.
   Richard Grissom Jr. was sentenced in Johnson County District
Court by Judge William Gray after an emotional appeal from the
father of a victim.
   ``Mr. Grissom has been given all the courteous treatment and
rights due him under Kansas law,'' Ralph Butler said. ``The
cowardly and premeditated crimes and the evil intent of these
crimes requires that Richard Grissom be given the absolute maximum
sentence that the law allows.''
   Grissom, 30, showed no emotion when he was sentenced.
   District attorney Paul Morrison said it will be 105 years before
Grissom's case could come before a parole board.
   Grissom was convicted on circumstantial evidence. He was driving
a car rented by one of the victims shortly after she disappeared,
and a few drops of blood were found in that car. He also had credit
cards and some personal belongings of all three women. He also had
copies of keys to their apartments and had worked as a painter at
the apartment complexes where they lived.
   Prosecutors contended the motive for the killings was the $3,600
withdrawn from their bank accounts shortly after they disappeared.
   The defense called no witnesses during the three-week trial and
argued that prosecutors had not proved their client committed any
crimes or that the women were dead.
   The jury deliberated about 12 hours before convicting Grissom.
   Grissom was sentenced to a minimum of 90 years and a maximum of
360 years for the murders of 34-year-old Joan Marie Butler of
Overland Park and roommates Christine Rusch and Theresa Brown, both
22 and of Lenexa. Both towns are Kansas City suburbs. Grissom also
lived in Lenexa.
   He was given a fourth life term for the aggravated kidnapping of
Miss Rusch.
   Grissom was convicted Nov. 4 of three counts of first-degree
murder.
   Grissom is expected to appeal. Jessica R. Cunen, the chief
appellate defender for the state, was appointed to represent him.
   The judge urged Grissom to tell the families where they could
find the bodies.
   ``None of them can be brought back,'' Gray said. ``But your part
in the lives of the remaining victims - the families - is still up
to you.
   ``You have to consider whether you have any consideration or any
compassion for these people. I encourage you to think about it.''
   ``The sentences were a relief, but the families still want to
know where the bodies are,'' said Harold Brown, father of Theresa
Brown. ``The pages aren't completely closed yet. Maybe someday he
will find it in his heart to tell us what he did with the girls.''
   Gray sentenced Grissom after rejecting a defense motion for a
new trial.
   Defense attorney Tom Erker argued Grissom received ineffective
counsel from the public defender's office for several months after
his arrest in July 1989, a month after the disappearances.
   Grissom also was convicted of two counts of aggravated burglary,
burglary, misdemeanor theft and four counts of robbery.

   Bertha Wilson, the first woman appointed to the
Supreme Court of Canada, will retire in January, Justice Minister
Kim Campbell announced Tuesday.
   Wilson, 67, a native of Kirkaldy, Scotland, began her legal
career in Nova cotia in 1957. In 1975, she was the first woman
appointed to the Ontario Court of Appeal.
   Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Wilson, a liberal, to
the Supreme Court in March 1984.
   Campbell paid tribute to Wilson saying she ``helped open the
legal profession and the administration of justice to Canadian
women.
   ``Your example has been an inspiration to a generation of women
pursuing careers in the law.
   ``In your judgments and commentaries, you have articulated
values of fundamental importance to all Canadians and have
challenged us to identify and eradicate inequalities in our
society.''
   There was no word on when a successor might be appointed.

   A perjury indictment that cost former Police Chief
Mack Vines his job was thrown out Tuesday after a judge ruled its
allegations were too vague.
   Former Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge John Onion quashed
the misdemeanor perjury indictment in a hearing, a court
spokeswoman said, referring all other questions to Assistant
District Attorney Ted Steinke.
   Steinke said the DA's office was drafting a new indictment that
would be filed Wednesday. ``This happens every day in the
courthouse. It's not unusual at all,'' he said.
   Vines said he was relieved the perjury charge was thrown out.
   ``I hope and pray that ... the assistant district attorney and
the district attorney's office will see the wisdom in not
refiling,'' he said.
   ``We'll review the new indictment, if they file, and see if it's
properly done,'' said his attorney, Bill Boyd. ``If not we'll file
to quash, again. If they've done it right, we'll prepare for
trial.''
   Vines was fired by Dallas City Manager Jan Hart on Sept. 12,
hours after being indicted on the perjury charge. He is accused of
lying to a special panel investigating the June 1989 firing of
officer Patrick LeMaire, who fatally shot an unarmed man last year.
LeMaire was reinstated in July by an administrative law judge but
declined to return to the police force.
   The perjury charge alleged that Vines lied to the panel about a
telephone conversation he had with assistant police chief Greg
Holliday on Aug. 2, the night before Holliday was to testify before
the panel. Holliday said Vines tried to influence his testimony.
Vines has maintained his innocence.
   Boyd said the indictment was quashed because ``the law in Texas
requires that if you allege perjury, you must first show the
statement that you allege to be false and then state what you claim
the truth to be.''
   ``They made a general allegation in the indictment as to what
they claimed to be false and they made no allegation as to what
they claimed the truth to be,'' he said.
   Tuesday's action was the latest setback in the district
attorney's prosecution of Vines, who had been police chief for two
years.
   Prosecutors initially filed the case in state district court,
but were told last month that the court had no jurisdiction because
official misconduct was not alleged.
   The case was moved to Dallas County Criminal Court, where Judge
John McCall stepped aside and asked Onion to preside.
   The city began a nationwide search for a new police chief after
Vines' dismissal. Sixty-two candidates have applied for the job,
including Acting Chief Sam Gonzales.

   There was no ``princely''

   Instead, Prince Philip got a true taste of Outback hospitality
by spending the night in a tent, sampling native food and using an

   The location was about 520 miles northwest of Brisbane on
property recently bought by the Queensland state government.
   Prince Philip's overnight visit with Queensland's Environment
Minister Pat Comben follows the government's initiatives to protect

   The duke and Queensland Premier Wayne Goss were expected

arid areas that are home to threatened species.
   Prince Philip arrived over the weekend for a 10-day visit.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of rebel fighters
attacked more than a dozen military positions in El Salvador on
Tuesday. At least 27 people were killed and 141 were wounded,
authorities said.
   The fiercest fighting was in the eastern provincial capitals of
San Francisco Gotera and Usulutan, where combat lasted more than
five hours. Fighting was reported in seven of the nation's 14
provinces.
   Leftist guerrillas attacked the main air base on the outskirts
of the capital, damaging one aircraft and an airman's dormitory,
and several military positions within a 15-mile radius of San
Salvador.
   A telephone survey of hospitals, first aid centers, military
officers in the field and town officials provided the casualty
figures. Victims included guerrillas, soldiers and civilians, the
officials said.
   Rebel sabotage damaged electrical installations and power lines
affecting about two-thirds of this Central American nation of more
than 5.5 million people, the government electrical company said.
   A rebel communique said the coordinated attacks in eastern,
northern and central El Salvador were meant to punish the army for
human rights abuses and inflexibility at the negotiating table.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, attacked
major garrisons in the east at Usulutan and San Francisco Gotera
shortly after 2 a.m. with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and
rifle fire.
   A resident of Usulutan city, reached by telephone, said combat
was fierce until 7 a.m. He said two air force helicopter gunships
and C-7 combat planes lent support to soldiers battling rebels on
the city's outskirts.
   The guerrillas also hit military detachments in Santa Elena,
Puerto Parada and Concepcion Batres - all in Usulutan province.
   Heavy combat was reported from Guatajiagua in Morazan province
near San Francisco Gotera.
   Fighting was also reported from the northern provincial capital
of Chalatenango, seat of a main garrison, and from Cuscatlan, La
Paz and La Libertad.
   Army positions were attacked in San Jose Guayabal, Suchitoto,
Apopa, Nejapa, Quetzaltepeque and Zacatecoluca - in central El
Salvador near the capital.
   In a communique signed by its senior five commanders, the FMLN
called the attacks a limited operation to prod President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government back to negotiating. The
administration called it a terrorist offensive.
   The rebel communique described the offensive as ``a military
response to the armed forces' impunity, repression, military
operations and the intransigence of the government, which refuses
to demilitarize society and clings to a criminal army.''
   It warned that a large-scale offensive may be launched if the
administration still refuses to negotiate.
   An FMLN spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
foreign correspondents: ``After holding talks with national groups
and foreign governments, it was decided not to launch an offensive
that had been planned, but a military operation instead to push the
negotiating process.''
   He did not specify which groups or foreign governments were
consulted.
   A government official told a news conference the offensive
``cannot be interpreted as isolated attacks. We have observed
relief columns and seen that the FMLN is in a position to beef up
its units that carried the (initial) attacks.''
   The attacks followed the anniversary of the army's massacre of
six Jesuit priests on Nov. 16, 1989, during a rebel offensive in
the capital.
   Those killings cost El Salvador half of its $85 million in U.S.
military aid planned for 1991.
   Rebel and government negotiators have held five rounds of peace
talks since May. The talks have bogged down amid mutual charges of
intransigence.
   The rebels express willingness to demobilize and join the
political process only if the current armed forces are disbanded.
   The guerrillas, international human rights groups and U.S.
congressional investigators say the U.S.-backed armed forces murder
and torture political opponents and are corrupt.
   Thousands of civilians have been killed by the army or
army-linked death squads in the 11-year-old civil war but no
officer has been convicted of a crime involving politically
motivated human rights abuse.
   In all, more than 73,000 people have been killed in the war,
including at least 30,000 civilians.

   A tanker that started taking on water while
carrying 24 million gallons of oil to Korea has been given
permission to head for San Francisco, the Coast Guard said Tuesday.
   ``We hoped the ship could come in during daylight hours, but now
it looks like it won't be until Wednesday,'' said Coast Guard Chief
Petty Officer Lance Jones.
   Divers managed to ``slow the leak to a trickle on Tuesday, but
they can't do any welding until the flow is stopped,'' Jones said.
The diving operation got off to a slow start because of rough seas.
   The tanker Kiku Pacific, owned by the Admitos Marine Co. of
Cyprus, took on 30 inches of water Monday in a leak from a 19-inch
cooling water pipe in its engine room, according to Coast Guard Lt.
Dick Kermond.
   The leak was controlled after the Coast Guard dispatched the
Cutter Sherman and a C-130 aircraft carrying a salvage pump to the
tanker, floating about 140 miles southwest of San Francisco.
   Five-foot swells delayed diving operations that had been
expected for Tuesday. The plan called for the divers to go down and
plug the leak from the outside.
   ``They are slowly making headway on the flooding,'' Jones said.
``They've rigged up some pumps, and the water in the engine room is
slowly diminishing.''

   A judge dismissed all charges Tuesday
against the former chief editor of the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat,
accused of impersonating a state prosecutor and pressuring a man
suing his brother to back off.
   Theodore N. Beitchman won the dismissal after he and a former
subordinate testified he was not at work when the harassing
telephone calls were made.
   Beitchman, who resigned as editor in chief after his arrest Oct.
1, told District Justice Susan McEwen he went home sick after
working less than a half-hour on March 13, the day of the telephone
calls.
   The newspaper's managing editor, Larry Hudson, testified that he
supervised the newspaper's production that day, supporting
Beitchman's contention.
   Beitchman, 44, was accused of calling Henry Malinowski,
identifying himself as an assistant attorney general and pressuring
Malinowski to drop a lawsuit against Beitchman's brother.
   Telephone showed the calls were made from the Johnstown
newspaper to Malinowski's home and business on March 13, but McEwen
said there was no proof Beitchman made them.
   She dropped charges of harassment and impersonating a public
servant.
   ``I don't want to gloat, believe me,'' Beitchman said. ``I'm
just so happy it's over.''
   Malinowski had sued Beitchman's brother, Arthur, to recover
money for repairs to his car, which was damaged in an accident
involving Arthur Beitchman's son.
   Chief Deputy District Attorney Ted Fritsch said he was
considering refiling charges, using additional evidence, but he
declined to elaborate.
   Defense attorney Ronald Elgart said the phone calls were a
setup.
   ``It sounds like somebody had it in for Ted Beitchman,'' Elgart
said.

   NBC is axing its low-rated ``Generations'' soap
opera and giving ``Today'' newscaster Faith Daniels her own daytime

   Station affiliates also will be told Wednesday that NBC is
working with Linda Ellerbee, who left NBC News four years ago, to
develop a new daytime information-entertainment series, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. NBC declined to
comment.
   The network only would say that NBC Entertainment Group chairman
Brandon Tartikoff and NBC Entertainment president Warren
Littlefield have taped a report to be sent to affiliates via
closed-circuit TV on Wednesday.
   The report, taped at NBC studios in Burbank, Ca., primarily will
concern NBC's struggling daytime schedule, the network said.
   Although ``Generations'' has been third in its time period,
various black groups have been campaigning to save the series,
which broke new ground when it premiered in March 1989 by focusing
on a black family as well as a white one.
   Daniels' show would succeed it in late January, according to a
source familiar with NBC's plans for the change. Daniels would
continue on ``Today.''
   Ellerbee's possible series, for which she has taped a pilot,
still is under development and has not yet been scheduled. The
show, produced by Mark Monsky, former executive producer of the
syndicated ``Hard Copy'' series, is tentatively entitled ``Women's
Diaries.''
   Ellerbee, who has been doing independent programs and has her
own production company, left NBC after it axed her ``NBC News
Overnight'' series, a low-rated, yet much-discussed late-hour
series.
   Although first in prime time ratings, NBC has been seeking ways
to bolster its daytime schedule, which has been a distant third in
the ratings.
   According to season-to-date Nielsen estimates, CBS is first with
a 5.5 rating for its daytime shows, followed by ABC with a 4.6. NBC
has averaged a 3.1. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.

   Atlantis and its five astronauts
safely returned home from a secret military mission Tuesday,
gliding smoothly to the first space shuttle landing in Florida in
five years.
   The shuttle, diverted from the California desert because of high
winds and damp runways, swooped through a clear, brilliant blue sky
and touched down at Kennedy Space Center at 4:43 p.m. Its arrival
was heralded by the customary twin sonic booms.
   ``Welcome home. It sure was a beautiful sight,'' Mission Control
told the crew.
   It was Kennedy's sixth shuttle landing; the last one was in
1985, when Discovery blew a tire.
   Workers had to scramble to prepare for the landing, assembling a
convoy of support vehicles and bringing in extra personnel.
Atlantis had begun its mission Thursday with an unusual nighttime
liftoff.
   ``We're here in Florida and we didn't expect to be here when we
left,'' Atlantis' commander Richard Covey said before leaving with
his crew Tuesday night for Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   ``The KSC folks did a good job of getting ready for us, and they
did a super job of getting us out of town last Thursday night when
we said we were going to go,'' Covey said.
   About 250 people, including two busloads of workers from the
launch control center, watched the landing from bleachers and a
grassy strip adjoining the paved runway. They whistled and cheered,
waving small American flags.
   Launch director Bob Sieck was among about a half-dozen NASA
officials who greeted Covey, pilot Frank Culbertson Jr. and the
rest of the crew.
   ``It's very special, just like the launch,'' Sieck said. ``You
have to remember that half the workforce (at Kennedy) has never
seen a shuttle landing.''
   ``They worked so hard to get it off, it's only fair that they
should see it land,'' said NASA safety official Al Parrish.
   William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said a
quick check of the shuttle showed it to be ``very clean'' with
dings on only a few of the heat-resistant tiles.
   Atlantis was supposed to land Monday at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., but high wind forced Mission Control to call off the plan
and extend the shuttle's flight. Flight director Randy Stone said
Atlantis had enough power and supplies to stay aloft until
Thursday, although it's doubtful NASA would wait until then to
bring the shuttle home.
   A quarter-inch of rain fell on the Mojave Desert lakebed late
Monday and early Tuesday, creating pools of water on the natural
surface runways and making them unsuitable for landing. The
concrete runway would have been the only option there on Tuesday
and probably on Wednesday.
   The outlook for Wednesday at Edwards was no better, prompting
NASA to opt for Kennedy. The sky over Kennedy was clear Tuesday,
and wind speed was well within landing limits.
   Kennedy's 2.8-mile-long paved runway, which has 1,000-feet
overruns on both ends and is 300 feet wide, provides less room for
maneuvering than the wide-open desert. Discovery, the last shuttle
to land at Kennedy, blew a tire and sustained brake damage during a
1985 landing.
   Atlantis had been orbiting amid a Pentagon-imposed silence since
Thursday. Sources said the astronauts deployed a satellite Friday
to spy on Iraq by either photographic surveillance or electronic
eavesdropping.
   In addition to Covey, an Air Force colonel, and Culbertson, a
Navy commander, the all-military crew has three mission
specialists: Army Maj. Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade
and Marine Col. Robert Springer.
   The mission was the seventh and last secret shuttle flight for
the Defense Department. Two more Pentagon missions are planned for
the shuttle, but the cargoes are unclassified.
   Atlantis was supposed to lift off in July with the spy
satellite, but was grounded by hydrogen leaks. The spacecraft
reportedly was modified to observe the Persian Gulf while the
shuttle was being fixed.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is preparing
for its next shuttle flight, an astronomy mission that has been on
hold since May. Columbia is scheduled to lift off with seven
astronauts and the $150 million Astro observatory in early
December.
   NASA saved $1 million by landing Atlantis at Kennedy and about a
week in shuttle processing time since the ship does not have to be
transported now across the country. The agency has modified
Kennedy's landing strip and developed new shuttle brakes with the
intent of landing on a regular basis in Florida in the next year or
so.
   Twenty-nine of the 37 shuttle flights to date have ended at
Edwards. Columbia was diverted to White Sands, N.M., in 1982
because the desert lakebed was flooded.
   The shuttle Challenger's Jan. 28, 1986, flight ended 73 seconds
after liftoff in an explosion that killed seven astronauts.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Security Council Should `Take Stock'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Tuesday the U.N. Security
Council should ``take stock'' of its sanctions against Iraq and
decide whether a new course of action is necessary. But the Soviets
again rebuffed President Bush's efforts to rally support for a
resolution authorizing military force.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, emerging from a
90-minute meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker, told
reporters, ``We need to consult with our colleagues and partners in
the Security Council.''
   But he stopped considerably short of backing any measure that
would advocate the use of force.
   Shevardnaze said the council should ``take stock of things and
pass appropriate judgment on what it has been doing.''
   Then, if necessary, he said, the body should ``adopt new
resolutions with a view to implementing all the previous
decisions.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis dominated the unofficial agenda at the
34-nation Conference on Cooperation and Security in Europe,
although French President Francois Mitterrand's spokesman said the
conference would not issue any statements on the crisis.
   ``There will be no common declaration by the 34 on the Gulf,''
Hubert Vedrine said after a 45-minute private meeting of the
leaders.
   Discussion in the closed session focused on such matters as
immigration from one European country to the next and the
continent's environment.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking to a public session of
the summit, called for action to ensure that the democratic process
in Eastern Europe does not collapse.
   ``Following the opening of national borders, there must now be
no borders which perpetuate the prosperity divide,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said that in a closed-door session
a number of nations expressed concern about an ''uncontrollable
refugee stream from the East.''
   On other topics:
   -Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said her country
intends to set up a fund, financed by a tax on its offshore
oilfields, to help less wealthy countries combat global warming.
   -The foreign ministers of the three Baltic republics - Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania - protested at the Soviet move excluding them
from the work of the conference summit.
   -Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall said he hoped ``the
conditions for the complete dissolution of the Warsaw Pact'' will
be created by early 1992. Antall is the first Warsaw Pact leader to
talk about the complete demise of the military alliance and to
offer a deadline.
   In another distraction, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
learned that former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine won enough
votes from Conservative members of Parliament to force a
second-round ballot next week that will decide if her 11 years in
office will come to an end.
   Thatcher has been America's steadiest ally on a range of issues,
including the effort to rally support for sterner action against
Iraq.
   Baker had been pressing a last-ditch effort to strike a deal
before Bush's trip to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. However, the
Soviet leader's statement indicated that the two sides were still
far apart.
   Even so, Baker said: ``The United States and the Soviet Union
have been united in their approach to this problem'' since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. ``We are united today. We intend to
remain united,'' he added.
   As the Paris summit wound down its second day, both U.S. and
Soviet officials unveiled plans for a superpower summit in Moscow
early next year to sign a treaty on reducing long-range nuclear
weapons.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was no firm
date for the summit, although he said both countries were shooting
for January. Fitzwater said having a nuclear arms treaty to sign
was a prerequisite for the summit, but holding the session in
January ``is what we have been talking about and shooting for.''
   Even before the end of the Baker and Shevardnadze meeting,
Fitzwater said it seemed ``very unlikely'' that support could be
rallied for a resolution to step up pressure before the president's
trip to the Middle East.
   The United States is seeking a new resolution giving advance
authority to using military action to drive Iraq's Saddam Hussein
out of Kuwait, although officials said exact language has not yet
been drafted.
   Shevardnadze, in effect, agreed that the matter should be
reopened by the United Nations - but declined to go beyond that.
   Resolutions already approved by the Security Council impose an
economic boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, call for Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of Kuwait's
previous government.
   The resolutions do not authorize military action as such, but do
leave the door open to other measures if Iraq fails to respond to
the steps.
   Fitzwater refused to confirm a report that one resolution being
discussed would call for automatic military action if Saddam had
not withdrawn in what Fitzwater called ``a month or two months or
three months or something like that.'' The spokesman said: ``There
are any number of approaches that are being considered. We will not
comment on any one of them.''
   Bush had failed to break the impasse during a two-hour private
dinner the night before with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He flies to front-line Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to meet with
Saudi leaders and the exiled emir of Kuwait on the crisis. He will
spend Thanksgiving with U.S. forces in the region and will meet
with Egyptian leaders on Friday.
   Baker will travel to Yemen and possibly beyond to try to drum up
support for U.S. moves, officials said Tuesday night.
   Kim Hoggard, a State Department spokeswoman, said Baker would
fly to Yemen on Thursday ``to discuss the situation in the Persian
Gulf and further steps we can take within the United Nations
framework.''
   Sources, demanding anonymity, said Baker might travel on to Oman
where he would confer with Malaysian officials. Both Yemen and
Malaysia are members of the 15-nation Security Council.
   Yemen is the only Arab nation on the council and has in the past
shown sympathy for Iraq. It will assume the council's rotating
presidency in December, taking over from the United States.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater criticized Saddam Hussein's decision to
release German hostages, saying ``He has spawned a cottage industry
of political ploys.''
   Earlier in the day there was a flurry of separate meetings among
leaders.
   Gorbachev met with Thatcher, who has issued calls for military
action against Iraq, stronger even than Bush's. Thatcher also met
with French President Francois Mitterrand, who like Gorbachev has
counseled patience.
   Ignatenko announced the Bush-Gorbachev summit at a briefing
here. On the subject of a strategic arms reduction treaty,
Ignatenko would only say, ``If it's ready, they will sign it.''
   U.S. sources said a summit seems likely early in January. But,
for the record, deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk
said: ``We have nothing to announce.''
   It would be Bush and Gorbachev's fifth face-to-face sessions as
leaders - Monday night's dinner and four ``summits,'' including
meetings earlier this year in Helsinki and Washington and one a
year ago in Malta.
   Bush may visit Turkey on the same trip. After Bush's meeting on
Tuesday with Turkish President Turgut Ozal, the White House
announced Bush would pay a state visit to Turkey ``in the first
part of 1991.''
   Turkey is letting American bombers use its airfields and has
closed a pipeline used by Iraq. But it has shown little enthusiasm
about a military confrontation with its neighbor.
   Bush also met with Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
According to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, Mazowiecki
promised a Polish hospital ship and rescue ship in support of U.N.
Persian Gulf policy.

   Iraqi lawmakers voted Tuesday to allow all German hostages to
leave Iraq and occupied Kuwait, and Saddam Hussein was reported to
be patching up his ties with a key ally by promising better
treatment of Palestinians living in Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, a former CIA official said Iraq was ``casing'' U.S.
military installations in the Middle East as possible terrorist
targets if war breaks out in the gulf.
   ``I don't believe the Iraqis are going to unleash that
capability against the Americans at this time,'' said Vincent M.
Cannistraro, who resigned as a terrorism anaylst in September.
``But they are certainly preparing themselves, positioning
themselves to do so once the situation changes.''
   Saddam last week pledged to halt Iraqi army harassment of the
estimated 400,000 Palestinian workers and their families who live
in Kuwait, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official
said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saddam
made the promise in a meeting with Yasser Abed Rabbo of the PLO's
Executive Committee.
   Palestinians returning to Jordan have complained of torture and
executions in Kuwait.
   The Iraqi lawmakers approved the special treatment of Germans
following a personal request by Saddam. There was only one
dissenting vote.
   The vote came after 90 minutes of debate, during which the
lawmakers heard from at least 10 of the ``guests,'' as Iraq calls
foreigners barred from leaving since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The hostages who addressed the National Assembly said freeing
the Germans would encourage European countries and the United
States to show their willingness to avert war and negotiate a
settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Parliament speaker Saadi Mahdi Saleh said there were 124 Germans
remaining in Iraq and Kuwait. No specific arrangements were made
for their departure.
   In Paris, German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher said of
Iraq's action: ``I believe we should appreciate above all that the
hostages are to be freed.''
   The gulf crisis continued to dominate the unofficial agenda in
Paris at the 34-nation Conference on Cooperation and Security in
Europe. French President Francois Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert
Vedrine, said the conference would not issue any statements on the
crisis.
   The January contract for light sweet crude, the benchmark blend
of U.S. oil, fell $1.81 to $28.91 a barrel Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, erasing a $1.72 gain from the previous
session.
   President Bush's failure to secure an agreement with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on the U.N. resolution to authorize
military action was viewed as indicating war was unlikely soon,
analysts said.
   Bush flies to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to meet with Saudi
leaders. He plans to spend Thanksgiving with U.S. forces in the
region. Supply officers are trying to assure that all 230,000
Americans deployed in the gulf will get fresh Thanksgiving dinners.
   The president voiced optimism that he would be successful in
overcoming Soviet objections to a U.N. resolution authorizing the
use of military force against Iraq. ``Just be patient and all will
be well,'' he told reporters when asked about Gorbachev's
reluctance.
   Also Tuesday, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff
said Saddam's order sending 250,000 more troops to Kuwait was a
publicity ploy.
   Gen. Colin Powell said it was possible that Saddam plans to use
the extra troops to replace weary soldiers at the front lines.
   ``But at the moment, it's just part of his headline-of-the-day
program where he tries to divert world opinion from his own
aggression,'' the four-star general told CBS' ``This Morning.''
``Yesterday was a troop buildup. The day before that, it was a
hostage release.''
   In Washington on Tuesday, a group of 45 Democratic lawmakers
filed a lawsuit to try to force Bush to seek authority from
Congress before ordering a U.S. military attack to drive Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait.
   ``We believe the president has a responsibility to send to
Congress a declaration of war,'' said Rep. Ronald V. Dellums,
D-Calif.
   The issue should be debated in Congress because ``there are
millions of American people in this country who have serious
questions about going to war,'' Dellums said. ``The president of
the United States on his own cannot make that kind of
determination.''
   Saddam met in Baghdad with delegations from France and
Switzerland on Monday and told them more Europeans would be allowed
to leave, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. A Dutch company
reported that 105 Dutchmen, 14 Belgians and three Britons who
completed a government-commissioned dredging project will be
permitted to depart.
   Hundreds of foreigners have been prevented from leaving since
Saddam's troops overran Kuwait, and the Western allies have accused
Saddam of trying to use the hostages to split the alliance against
him.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as saying that
freeing the Germans would encourage others to distance themselves
from the Western allies pushing for war with Iraq.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Bush this week that a
peaceful solution was still possible. ``Whoever believes the
problem can be solved militarily must consider not only the
mission, but the end of the whole undertaking,'' Kohl said.
   Germany's constitution prohibits the deployment of German troops
outside the country's borders. Germany provided merchant ships to
transport U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and contributed $2 billion to
support the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf.

   Muhammad Ali, who converted to Islam in the
mid-1960s, flew to Iraq to share a Thangsgiving meal with U.S.
hostages in Baghdad, an anti-war group said Tuesday.
   The three-time heavyweight boxing champion, who changed his name
from Cassius Clay in 1964 after adopting the Moslem faith, was
scheduled to arrive in the Iraqi capital Wednesday, said Gavrielle
Gemma, spokeswoman for the Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in
the Middle East.
   The retired boxer from Louisville, Ky., will meet with
unspecified Iraqi leaders before sharing a Thanksgiving meal with
several Americans refused permission to leave Iraq, she said.
   Ali was not representing the anti-intervention coalition, but
the group had helped him with travel arrangements, Gemma said.
   Ali also planned to visit athletes, local schools and other
groups during the viit expected to last through the holiday
weekend, she said.
   Mike Brennan of the U.S. State Department in Washington said Ali
would not have to check in with them before traveling to Iraq as
long as he intended to spend no money there.
   This would mean, for example, that his expenses would be picked
up by someone in Iraq, he said.
   Since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq has prevented
thousands of Westerners from leaving the two countries in an effort
to deter an attack by a U.S.-led multinational force massing in the
Persian Gulf region.

<HEAD>Florida Legislature Passes Tough Ethics Bill in Wake of Lobbying
Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ethics bill hailed as one of the
toughest in the country cleared the state Legislature unanimously
Tuesday as lawmakers sought to restore public confidence amid a
criminal investigation.
   The bill would prohibit gifts over $100 from lobbyists and
political action committees to more than 32,000 state and local
public officials. It makes exceptions for food and drink and for
gifts from relatives, fiances and roommates.
   The measure, which would take effect Jan. 1, would impose a fine
of up to $5,000 and a two-year lobbying ban on lobbyists who
violate it. Officials could be removed from office.
   The measure passed the House 119-0 with little debate, then was
approved by the Senate 39-0. The Legislature then adjourned its
3{-hour special session on the subject. The bill was sent to Gov.
Bob Martinez, who is expected to sign it.
   The bill was sparked by an investigation into legislators'
acceptance of trips to hunting lodges, ski resorts and foreign
countries from lobbyists and their failure to report them as the
law now requires.
   State Attorney Willie Meggs has subpoenaed records from dozens
of lobbyists as part of the probe.
   ``I believe it's one of the toughest pieces of ethics
legislation ever written in this country,'' said Rep. Everett
Kelly, a Democrat who chaired the joint committee that drafted the
bill.
   Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Ander Crenshaw, tried
to amend the bill to prohibit officials from accepting any gifts
from lobbyists, no matter their value.
   ``Under this bill, (a lobbyist) couldn't give you a $400 set of
golf clubs,'' said Sen. Richard Langley, a Republican. ``But he
could give it to you one club at a time.''
   But Sen. Tom Brown, a Democrat who was the chief Senate sponsor,
urged no changes so the bill wouldn't have to return to the House
for further consideration. He said the $100 limit could be changed
by the Legislature in the future.
   Bill Jones of the Common Cause government watchdog group said
the bill was ``a good first step,'' but paled in comparison with
the need for campaign finance reform.
   The measure clearly defines what a gift is and makes several
exceptions, most importantly allowing lobbyists to pay for food and
drink of any price if it's consumed at a single sitting.
   Government entities - such as state commissions, school boards
and city councils - could give officials gifts, but universities
and colleges could not. That would end such perks as football
weekends for legislators.
   Gifts such as those from government entities and from a person
who isn't a lobbyist would have to be reported quarterly if over
$100.

<HEAD>British Businessman Said Feared Kidnapped in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Beirut newspapers on Tuesday
published a letter from friends of a British businessman who said
he has been missing in Lebanon since April and is feared kidnapped.
   The letter was published in Arabic by the daily Ad-Diyar and in
French by L'Orient-Le Jour. It was signed by ``friends of British
businessman Robin Gregson'' and addressed to ``his kidnappers.''
   The letter said Gregson's disappearance was reported to the
British Embassy three months ago but was ignored.
   But an embassy source said:
   ``The embassy was notified sometime in April of his
disappearance and was in touch with his wife back in Britain.''
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would say
nothing else other than to confirm that Gregson reportedly
disappeared near Chekka and Jounieh.
   The letter said: ``Our friend Robin Gregson went missing more
than six months ago between the town of Chekka and the port of
Jounieh. He was heading for Jounieh to leave via its port on April
21.''
   Chekka is a coastal town in Syrian-policed north Lebanon and
Jounieh is the main port in the Christian enclave, which is
controlled by rightist militiamen of Samir Geagea's Lebanese
Forces.
   A passenger boat line serves the Christian enclave with daily
trips from Jounieh to Larnaca, Cyprus.
   ``We have inquired about his whereabouts with the Lebanese and
Cypriot immigration authorities as well as with a number of
political parties in north Lebanon, but to no avail,'' the letter
said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot benamed under standing rules,
speculated that Gregson ``might have been held by one of the
various militias.''
   ``To his kidnappers we say: Release Robin so he could return to
his family and friends,'' the letter said. ``More than seven years
ago he chose to live in Lebanon because he loved Lebanon despite
all that has happened.''
   An editor at Ad-Diyar, speaking on condition he not be named,
said the letter was contained in an ``unsealed white envelope
dropped in the newspaper's mail box. It did not carry a sender's
address.''
   No details were available on what Gregson was doing in Lebanon.
   Because his disappearance remains unconfirmed, Gregson was not
listed among the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon and believed
kidnapped by pro-Iranian underground factions.
   The missing Westerners include six Americans, four Britons, two
Germans and an Italian. Terry A. Anderson, the 43-year-old chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held
the longest, since March 16, 1985.

   Auburn University's faculty senate on
Tuesday asked President James Martin to explain his refusal to
grant tenure for a Roman Catholic priest rebuked by the Vatican.
   Martin, however, balked at discussing his denial of a permanent
position for Rev. Charles E. Curran and told the senate to take its
complaint to the board of trustees, which already has expressed
support for the president.
   ``I totally reject even the slightest insinuation that I or my
decisions have violated anyone's academic freedom,'' Martin told
the senate.
   Curran, the only American barred by Rome from teaching Catholic
theology, accepted a one-year appointment at Auburn, where he now
teaches in an endowed professorship.
   The school initially advertised the post as being tenured, and
Curran said he learned the job was not tenured only after he had
already decided to accept it.
   In the spring, Martin overruled two faculty committees that had
recommended Curran for the tenured position as Goodwin-Philpott
Eminent Scholar of Religion. Martin has refused to explain his
decision, either publicly or to Curran.
   The faculty senate, which could have asked Martin to reverse his
decision, adopted a resolution that asked the president to make
arrangements by Dec. 7 to meet with the tenure promotion committee
and discuss his denial of tenure.
   If Martin fails to comply with the request, the senate will ask
its executive committee to call a meeting of the entire faculty,
which could lead to a formal censure or a vote of no confidence.
   University Senate Chairman Gary Mullen said before the meeting
that the senate was not concerned with why Martin denied tenure for
Curran. ``Our worry is the subversion of the tenure process,'' he
said.
   But Miller Soloman, an English professor and former senate
chairman, said, ``We want to give (Martin) every chance to explain
... what his reasons were for not granting Dr. Curran tenure. The
fact that he would not divulge his reasons taints Dr. Curran's
reputation.''
   Curran, 56, had said he did not plan to attend Tuesday's
meeting.
   ``I am not really a player in this anymore,'' Curran, author of
20 books on Christian ethics and morality, said in an interview
last week. ``It is all going on around me.''
   Curran has been involved in disagreements with Rome since the
1960s. He led opposition to a 1968 Vatican decree against
artificial birth control and also disputes the church's stance
against abortion.
   In 1986, the Vatican cited Curran for his disagreements with
church doctrine and barred him from teaching Catholic theology.
Since then, some 750 Catholic theologians have signed a statement
supporting him, and the University of Notre Dame Press still
publishes his books.

   The wife of a former Contra leader
accused the Sandinista-run police of torturing her husband to force
a confession in which he implicated the vice president in an
anti-government conspiracy.
   The government of President Violeta Chamorro denied her claim,
but the nation's Roman Catholic archbishop was quoted as saying the
purported plot was just ``a show'' and raising questions about her
presidency.
   Aristides Sanchez was released Monday after spending four days
in El Chipote prison on suspicion of planning a 2-week-long series
of protests by former Contras and their sympathizers.
   Before his release Sanchez signed a confession implicating Vice
President Virgilio Godoy, which was read on national television
Monday night by security officials. Sanchez and his wife left
Monday on a plane for Miami without speaking to reporters.
   Cecilia Rodriguez de Sanchez, in an interview by phone from
Miami with a Managua radio station Tuesday, claimed her husband was
drugged, kept in cells ``full of rats in 100-degree heat'' and in
``a drawer, like they have in the morgue.''
   La Prensa newspaper, which is owned by Mrs. Chamorro's family,
ran a front-page story quoting Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo as
calling Sanchez's alleged confession and the televised appearance
of government officials ``a show.''
   He said Mrs. Sanchez told him her husband was tortured and
drugged while in custody and ``I am worried about that,'' according
to the paper.
   It quoted Obando y Bravo as saying he spoke to Mrs. Chamorro
about the political situation and believes ``she does not have all
the information that she should have and all the control that a
person who guides the destiny of a country should have.''
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo said Sanchez, 47, was
treated well and kept in an air-conditioned office because of his
heart condition.
   There was no answer at Sanchez's residence in Miami. Before
returning to Nicaragua this year, he was a leader-in-exile of the
U.S.-backed rebel forces that tried for 10 years to oust the
leftist Sandinista government.
   The Sandinistas lost February's elections to a coalition headed
by Mrs. Chamorro and Godoy. Since taking office in April, Mrs.
Chamorro has kept Sandinistas in control of the army and police, to
the chagrin of Godoy and other coalition members.
   Mrs. Sanchez said her husband was forced to sign the confession
and go into exile or face a lengthy prison stay.
   He was held at El Chipote, the maze of rotting cells and torture
chambers where dictator Anastasio Somoza kept his political foes
before he was ousted by the Sandinista-led revolution in 1979.
   Lacayo said Sanchez was free to return from exile if he wished
to face conspiracy charges. He said Sanchez was visited by
representatives of the church, the Organization of American States
and his wife.
   OAS representative Santiago Murray said he saw Sanchez on
Thursday.
   ``We spoke for about 15 minutes. He seemed to be in good
health,'' Murray said. But he couldn't vouch for Sanchez' overall
treatment.
   In Sanchez' confession, he accused Godoy and other leaders of
the fractious, 14-member government coalition of organizing the
protests to force Mrs. Chamorro to resign.
   Godoy, who has praised the anti-government demonstrations, said
Sanchez's accusations were ``a tragicomedy.''
   ``They are trying to involve me in everything. If tomorrow there
is an eclipse, they'll probably blame me for that too,'' Godoy
said.
   Godoy and others claim that Mrs. Chamorro is being manipulated
by her chief of staff, Antonio Lacayo, who they believe is too cozy
with the Sandinistas.
   Since late last month, demobilized Contra fighters and
disaffected members of the governing coalition have blocked roads
and seized town halls, mostly in southeastern Nicaragua, to demand
that Sandinista officials resign. At least 10 people have died in
clashes between protesters and armed forces.
   The protests have eased a bit in recent days.
   Sanchez's confession, as read by Sandinista Police Commander
Javier Lopez, said the conspirators hoped to whip up discontent and
``make Nicaragua ungovernable through fomenting chaos and
anarchy.''
   ``All these pressures would force (Mrs. Chamorro) to resign and
thus Dr. Virgilio Godoy Reyes would be able to assume the
presidency of the republic,'' the confession said.
   Godoy mocked the broadcast as following ``the most exact
Sandinista style.''
   The Sandinistas often paraded accused conspirators before
television cameras to read confessions to the nation.

   A group of Harvard Law School students
filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Harvard University, charging that
it discriminates on the basis of sex and race in hiring law school
faculty members.
   ``We'd like to sue our school,'' second-year law student Linda
Singer cheerfully told the clerk of the Middlesex County Superior
Court.
   The 38-page lawsuit alleges that Harvard Law School has failed
to hire any minority women, Asian Americans, native Americans,
disabled, Latinos or openly homosexual men or women to tenured or
tenure-track faculty positions.
   The lawsuit also charges that Harvard Law's faculty includes far
fewer blacks and women than are represented in the general
population of lawyers.
   The university's hiring practices ``operate to
disproportionately exclude qualified women and minority candidates
for tenured and tenure-track positions,'' the lawsuit claims.
``These hiring practices constitute a continuing pattern and
practice of discrimination in violation of state law.''
   The law school's dean, Robert C. Clark, said the lawsuit has no
merit.
   ``The issue of diversity on the faculty is an important one and
the law school's record is strong,'' Clark said in a statement.
``In the past decade, 45 percent of those whom the law school has
hired in tenure-track positions have been women or members of
minority groups.''
   The lawsuit, signed by 11 Harvard Law students, was filed by a
student group called the Harvard Law Coalition for Civil Rights
under a state law which bars discrimination in hiring by businesses
or institutions with 15 or more employees.
   According to the coalition, five of 66 tenured and tenure-track
faculty members at the law school are women, or 7.58 percent.
Nationwide, at law schools approved by the American Bar
Association, 23.7 percent of faculty are women. The students
maintain that women make up 36.75 percent of the law graduates
since 1980.
   Of the law school's four tenure-track faculty members, two are
black but none are women, the lawsuit says. And three of 62 tenured
positions, or 4.84 percent, are black.
   Clark did not challenge the students' figures but said that the
lawsuit failed to mention that about one-third of the school's
part-time lecturers are women or minorities.
   Last year, law students occupied Clark's office for two days to
protest Harvard's hiring policies.
   The lawsuit asks the court to order Harvard to give weight to
diversity in its hiring decisions, establish an affirmative action
hiring plan, and allow visiting faculty members to be hired
immediately without going through a one-year waiting period.
   Derrick Bell, who in 1971 became the first black appointed to a
full-time faculty post at the law school, attended a sidewalk news
conference after the students filed the lawsuit. He took an unpaid
leave of absence in April to protest Harvard's hiring policies.
   Bell rejected the argument advanced by Harvard and other
universities that affirmative action plans dilute the quality of
faculty.
   ``The diversity vs. quality argument is a smoke screen intended
to obscure the fact that these schools' faculties remain
predominantly white and male and that the quality of their teaching
and scholarship covers a wide range from excellent to abysmal,''
Bell said.

<HEAD>Census Bureau Says Detroit Tops Million Mark</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Volunteers scouring Detroit for people missed by
U.S. Census counters helped push the city over the 1 million mark
needed to retain big-city political clout and federal and state
dollars, Census officials said Tuesday.
   Preliminary census figures released in August estimated the
city's population at 970,000, a tally city officials challenged,
sending out volunteers to search every street for uncounted
Detroiters.
   While the final count still isn't in, Census Bureau Director
Barbara Bryant told Mayor Coleman Young that the city had topped 1
million. Included in the recent tally were such people such as
military personnel stationed elsewhere during the first count,
Bryant said.
   ``It includes people who might have been in a winter home on
April 1. That, for example, added 22,000 people to the count,'' she
said.
   ``Hooray, hooray, hooray,'' Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat, said
from his office in Washington. ``The powers that be finally got the
message that the oppressed, the homeless, and the impoverished
don't always have phones and houses from which to be recorded.''
   The preliminary count would have continued a steady decline from
1.2 million in 1980, 1.5 million in 1970, 1.7 million in 1960 and a
high of 1.9 million in 1950, according to Census Bureau figures.
   Officials have estimated that falling below 1 million would cost
Detroit about 16 percent of its annual operating revenue of $1.9
billion.
   For example, about one-fourth of the city's $1.1 billion general
fund budget is from shared portions of state sales, income,
intangible and single business taxes, and other levies that would
be cut if population dwindled.
   The city would lose $38 million to $50 million in state-shared
tax revenue in the first year new formulas were adopted, according
to Michigan Citizens Research Council figures.
   Young mounted a massive ``Detroit, Were You Counted?'' campaign
to round up uncounted residents.
   By Oct. 24, the deadline for submitting additional names to the
Census Bureau, Young said the volunteer forces had found 121,350
uncounted residents and estimated the final count would be at least
1.1 million.
   Census spokesman Jerry Blocker said agency officials found that
some of the names fed into the computer had been already counted.
   But ``if they were missed, they will definitely be counted,''
Blocker said Tuesday. ``We don't have a final figure, but we will
tell you it's over a million.''

<HEAD>Nosair Indicted In Kahane's Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused of assassinating Rabbi Meir
Kahane, the controversial anti-Arab activist, was indicted Tuesday
on second-degree murder charges, a district attorney's office said.
   A grand jury also charged El Sayyid Nosair, 35, of Cliffside
Park, N.J., with attempted murder, assaulting a police officer,
second-degree assault, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless
endangerment and coercion, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said
in a statement.
   Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to
life in prison.
   Nosair apparently acted alone and police authorities have found
no evidence that he is linked to any Mideast terrorist
organization, Morgenthau said.
   Nosair allegedly shot the rabbi once behind the ear with a
.357-caliber Magnum on Nov. 5 as Kahane finished delivering a
speech to a Zionist group in a hotel in midtown Manhattan.
   Nosair then allegedly shot and wounded someone in the audience
who tried to stop him as he ran out and jumped into a cab. He
allegedly got out of the cab a block away and shot a U.S. Postal
Service officer, who returned the fire and struck the gunman in the
neck. Nosair has since recovered.
   Nosair was being held without bail from his original
arraignment.
   The Brooklyn-born Kahane served for four years in Israel's
parliament but was barred from holding office in 1988 after
legislators there approved a law banning parties with a racist
platform.
   Kahane, who campaigned to drive Arabs from Israel, also founded
the Jewish Defense League in this country and urged American Jews
to arm themselves against anti-Semites.
   Nosair, who was born in Egypt, had been employed by the city
Department of General Services fixing heating and air conditioning
systems in court buildings.
   Police have said Nosair was taking prescription drugs for
depression when the shooting happened.

   Less than two weeks after President Bush ordered
200,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf to gain parity with Iraq,
Saddam Hussein has again raised the stakes, ordering another
250,000 troops of his own into Kuwait.
   In another frustrating development for U.S. gulf policy, Bush
failed on Monday to get Soviet agreement on a proposed U.N.
resolution authorizing force against Iraq.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev went so far only as to agree that
force in the gulf ``cannot be ruled out,'' officials said.
   A poll published today, meanwhile, indicated that Americans are
increasingly worried that Bush favors the military option over the
diplomatic route to resolve the crisis precipitated by Iraq's Aug.
2 seizure of Kuwait.

   LONDON (AP) - Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faced the
toughest challenge of her 11{ years in power today as Conservative
lawmakers, worried by low poll ratings, gathered for a vote on
whether to keep her as party leader.
   The 372 Conservatives in the House of Commons must choose
between Mrs. Thatcher and her former defense secretary, Michael
Heseltine.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, spoke confidently of winning, while
Heseltine's supporters were hopeful they would gain enough votes to
force a second ballot.
   The prime minister, in Paris for a 34-nation summit, says she
hasn't finished her mission as Britain's longest-serving prime
minister of the century, and that Heseltine would betray her
free-market economic crusade.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate Ethics Committee's attorney is
ridiculing senators' claims that he invented ethical standards in
suggesting they dealt improperly with savings and loan millionaire
Charles H. Keating Jr.
   ``In this body, with all due respect, are your standards a
double one?'' special counsel Robert S. Bennett asked Monday. ``Are
you above everyone else?''
   The ethics panel is holding its fourth day of hearings today
into allegations that five senators improperly intervened with
federal regulators on behalf of Keating, owner of the failed
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Keating was a financial contributor to the senators' campaigns
and favored causes. The collapse of his once high-flying empire is
estimated to cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion to cover
federally insured deposits.

   ATLANTA (AP) - America's crime capital imposed the city's
strictest curfew since the Atlanta child murders of the early
1980s, threatening to jail parents of youngsters caught on the
street after hours.
   No arrests were reported in the first few hours after the curfew
went into effect at 11 p.m. Monday.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has threatened to challenge
the law, but city officials say it is needed to help the reverse
the highest rate of serious crime in the nation.
   Mayor Maynard Jackson praised the curfew as an excellent way of
keeping youngsters from being used as drug runners or lookouts.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Can cobblestone survive in the asphalt jungle?
That issue, and those surfaces, have divided a historic block and
left the street a half-cobbled, half-paved patchwork of ruts and
potholes.
   Franklin Street's cobblestone controversy pits some of the
artists and professionals who have moved into lofts in the old
textile district in lower Manhattan against businessmen still
trying to make a living there.
   And it raises the question of how much the city is willing to
spend to preserve a street surface that went out with the horse and
buggy.
   ``At a time when the city is raising taxes and laying people
off, it's elitist to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on
cobblestones for one block,'' said Waring Abbott, who thinks
cobblestones belong in a museum. ``Why not put them on Fifth
Avenue, too?''

<HEAD>Charles Kuralt Off the Road for Thanksgiving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans will be sitting down to
Thanksgiving dinner, and Charles Kuralt will be ... well, the CBS
commissary isn't that bad. Honest. At least he'll be off the road.
   He and co-anchor Lesley Stahl will be working as usual on
``America Tonight,'' the late-night CBS News series that began in
October as an outgrowth of CBS' specials on the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Kuralt, who reckons he has logged a million miles for the ``On
the Road'' tales of American life he's done for the ``CBS Evening
News'' since 1967, returned last week from three weeks of
campaigning and working.
   The campaign was a publicity tour for his fifth book, ``A Life
on the Road,'' a chronicle of his youth and life at CBS since he
joined the network as a writer in 1957.
   Unlike most scriveners wandering the book-tour desert, Kuralt,
56, continued at his regular job. He co-anchored ``America
Tonight'' from Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   It was an experience as odd as it was exhausting, he reports:
``I'd run around and praise myself all day, then work on that show
all night.''
   He also continued anchoring ``CBS News Sunday Morning.''
   The campaign and tour wouldn't have come to pass had he not
agreed to write ``A Life'' after his last book, the best-selling
``On the Road With Charles Kuralt,'' a collection of the road
pieces he'd done for CBS.
   It helped, though, that he took the liberty of spending the
advance for the new book before writing it: ``Of course. Don't you
always? First, you spend the advance. Then, finally, you learn you
have to write the book.''
   The last is a horrible moment for most authors. Facing the
prospect of demands for a return of the publisher's advance money,
they commence tussling with the muse.
   Thanks to the patience of his publisher, Kuralt's tussle came in
bits and pieces, then in a flurry of typewriter-pounding when the
publisher said the book was coming out this fall, ready or not.
   The book emerged three years after Kuralt agreed to write it. It
got a nice pre-publication boost last month when the New York
Times' travel section excerpted part of it.
   Suprisingly, the part didn't concern the reports on small-town
America for which Kuralt is best known.
   Instead, it was his lamentation that it's no fun to fly on
airlines anymore, that travellers face cramped seats, unsmiling
flight attendants and airport ``hubs'' that are little more than
treadmills to oblivion.
   He readily agreed with a suggestion that the fun started to fade
when propellor-driven DC-7s were phased out and the era of jets,
particularly jumbo jets, began.
   Maybe it's his age, he said, but, ``I used to find flying
somewhere kind of romantic. Now it's become an ordeal.''
   There is the possibility that next year, Kuralt may return not
to airlines, but to his CBS bus.
   There could be more ``On the Road'' pieces - his last was in
January - should CBS decide at the end of December to park its
half-hour ``America Tonight'' series.
   Of what will happen, Kuralt said, ``I don't know for sure. I
assume that it depends on part on events in the Persian Gulf, if
that heats up. That's just my assumption. Nobody's ever told me
that.
   ``But the word is that it's going to go off the air (at the end
of the year) because the network has all these action-adventure
shows they want to try out in that time period.''
   He referred to the fact that CBS is considering installing a
revolving set of series in January against NBC's ``Tonight,'' ABC
News' ``Nightline'' and Arsenio Hall's syndicated ventures in
admiring visiting celebrities.
   (No decision has been made yet and ``America Tonight'' ``has not
been told definitely that it's off at the end of December,'' a CBS
spokeswoman said.)
   If the series continues, ``I'm going do this as long as it's on,
or as long as they want me to,'' Kuralt said.
   But if it gets a closing notice, the bus on which he does his
``On the Road'' pieces is parked in Chicago, ``waiting for me to
come back to work if I can manage it. And that's my fervent hope.
   ``Because that's the thing I've enjoyed most - wandering around
and doing those little stories.''

<HEAD>Penn &amp; Teller's `Don't Try This At Home' - As If You Would</HEAD>

   Teller speaks!
   Penn is silent!
   Ha! Got your attention! Those two swindlers of sleight, those
Houdinis of hustle, stick to their usual roles for their NBC
special tonight: ``Penn &amp; Teller: Don't Try This At Home!'' But for
this interview, Teller speaks, Penn doesn't.
   Penn (last name Jillette; tall, wide, loud, boots, bracelets,
funny haircut) usually handles the talking for their act. Teller
(no last name, shorter, slighter, mild and innocent-eyed) is
eloquently silent.
   His last speaking role on television was the 1987 made-for-cable
movie ``Long Gone;'' before that, he acted in an episode of ``Miami
Vice.''
   He's usually the bemused, smiling object of their crazed,
perilous magic. For the grand finale of their NBC show, Teller gets
driven over by a 70,000-pound truckload of concrete blocks.
Miraculously, he is not squished.
   ``It's something we always wanted to do,'' Teller said in a
telephone interview from the daring duo's midtown Manhattan
workshop. ``For five years we've been saying `Wouldn't it be fun to
drive a truck over Teller?'''
   It is not a pretty sight. Even Teller admits he was a bit
squeamish when the trick first was tested - on Penn &amp; Teller's
``director of covert activities'' Robbie Libbon. ``I nearly jumped
out of my skin,'' Teller said.
   It will give you the creeps, and the boys cling to their
tradition of revealing how they do it. They also perform a
beautifully choreographed illusion to music - then give away the
secret of that, too.
   Penn performs a silent, very romantic fire-eating duet with the
lovely model Carol Perkins, who ``learned fire-eating in about a
half hour,'' Teller said. ``I've tried to learn fire-eating for
about five years.''
   There's also a great bit where Penn loudly declares that all
magicians who produce animals onstage are wimps, and the two
isolate themselves inside a glass booth and produce thousands of
live bees. Honest.
   ``You learn to move very slowly and deliberately,'' Teller said.
   It's not really a trick, he explained. Bees sting only when
they're protecting their nest or if they're pushed. Teller said he
was stung only twice, while Teller got 20 stings. It is creepy in
the extreme.
   ``We worked up to it gradually,'' Teller said. ``At first, we
wore the full beekeeper's outfit, then just the headgear, then `OK,
we'll take gloves off now, then we were covered in bug repellent. .
.. By the time we got on the air, we thought part of the
entertainment value for the audience was watching bees all over our
heads and faces.''
   The lads also took the precaution of testing themselves and
their crew against the venom of a full range of stinging insects.
   Their guest, Jane Curtin, performs a classic sleight of hand
with audience members. Her patter is warm and sweet until she's
``compelled'' to do a Penn &amp; Teller-designed trick called ``The
Infected Ear.'' She gets nasty. It's great.
   One cannot pigeonhole the art of Penn &amp; Teller as comedy,
horror, suspense, magic or ``the new vaudeville.'' Teller isn't
interested in trying.
   ``Figuring that out isn't my job,'' he said.
   ``I do know a couple of things. One is that we're basically
self-taught; we really aren't following anybody else's rules. We're
doing stuff that Penn likes and I like. That's the only
qualification. Penn likes it and I like it.
   ``We just put together what we thought was good without putting
it into a classification, without worrying about the terminology,''
he said.
   And now for the silent portion of our interview, in which Penn
(large, loud, funny hair) does not speak.
   Teller handed the phone to Penn.
   Penn remains silent. In the background, Teller can be heard
shouting, ``He's smiling! He's nodding! I think he thinks you're an
OK guy! Now I'm going to put his head underwater!''
   What is Penn's expression under water, Teller?
   ``He's trying to do a bemused smile and it's not quite
working.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   STILL CRAZY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS: Television never tires of
giving us characters and situations that would play better in
Looney Tunes - and certainly with a greater sense of realism.
``Broken Badges'' is one such.
   It aspires to be an action drama about a team of police on
psychiatric leave from their jobs. This is reassuring. Imagine,
emotionally disturbed people with guns AND badges!
   New Orleanians will wince at seeing Miguel Ferrer try to play a
New Orleans policeman of Cajun ancestry who pronounces the term of
enderament ``cher'' like the entertainer's name, instead of halfway
between ``shay'' and ``sheh.'' And they'll scream when another
supposed New Orleans policeman pronounces the city ``New
Aw-LEENZ,'' instead of ``Noo Orlins,'' as the locals say it.

<HEAD>Prison Beauty Shop Gives Inmates Reason to Feel Good</HEAD>

   The chatter resembles that of any beauty
salon. Women tease each other about their ages and their graying
hair as they sit under hair dryers and flip through timeworn
magazines.
   Posters of the latest hairstyles cover the battered walls, and
the pungent odor of the solution used for permanents fills the air.
   The tools of the beauty trade at the medium-security
Florence-Crane Women's Facility are nothing special, but they're of
some concern. Scissors, electric razors and chemicals can be
dangerous - especially in the hands of convicted criminals.
   Some of these women are locked up for life. Some can receive no
visitors. But still, inmates say, the prison beauty shop serves an
essential purpose.
   ``Everyone feels better, even if they've had a bad day,'' said
beautician Diane Carter, serving 20 years on drug and escape
charges. ``It's just like going shopping - you get depressed and
you go shopping.''
   ``It's not a privilege. It's a necessity for a lot of us,'' said
Sherron Butler, who is serving up to 14 years for writing bad
checks and escape.
   ``We're also still human beings and if you love yourself, you're
going to take care of yourself. When I got here, I said, `Great,
they have a beauty shop. I can continue to be me.'''
   Butler was getting this season's favorite style, the $25 wave
nouveau. In addition to the curl, she often comes in to have her
hair colored - autumn mist is her shade - and to buy cocoa butter
lotion.
   Rather than chip off her nail polish, she can spend a quarter to
dip her fingers and toes in nail polish remover. Inmates can have
nail polish outside the shop, but the remover contains alcohol and
stays put.
   The shop has its regulars, but most inmates cut each other's
hair in the housing units, where they're permitted to check out
blunt-ended scissors.
   Each state prison has a hair care area where inmate barbers are
supervised by a civilian cosmetologist, said Gail Light, a
spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Corrections.
   In federal prisons, basic haircuts are free, said Dan Dunne,
assistant public information officer for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons
in Washington, D.C. Inmates who want something special, like a perm
or dye, can buy the materials at a commissary and bring them to the
prison's cosmetology unit for application, he said.
   The beauty shop at the Florence-Crane facility is cramped. One
authentic cosmetology chair is joined by a host of outdated barber
equipment bought used or donated. Hairdryers line the wall near the
window sill, where a newly arrived air conditioner blows comfort on
feverish, summer days.
   Mildred Perry, one of four inmate beauticians, remembers
converting the space from junk room to beauty shop when she was
transferred to Florence-Crane in 1985.
   ``There was a desperate need for a beauty shop,'' said Perry,
who is serving a life term for second-degree murder. ``We knew the
self-esteem would go down. They didn't care about themselves any
more.
   ``This was the only chair, there was one working spigot with
cold water and one bucket. It just grew and grew. We had to get a
crochet needle to pull the hair through the cap for the first
frostin job we did.''
   Most of the cosmetology unit's operating costs are covered by
what they charge customers, and its prices are competitive with
outside shops. A price list hangs near the rinse sink: $14 for
``jazzing color,'' $20 for a frosted perm, $6 for hot oil and
condition treatment, $5 for a plain cut.
   Money never changes hands. Women contact the cosmetology unit
for an appointment, and the civilian cosmetologist, who operates
mostly as an observer, checks their accounts to make sure they have
enough.
   The shop in the main prison is open two days a week, and the
four prisoners serve about a dozen customers each day. An annex
salon is open Saturdays.
   Some of the workers had cosmetology experience before being sent
to the prison. Others picked it up in prison. Inmates have asked
for a certification program so they'll be able to get cosmetology
jobs when they leave prison, but there is no money to pay for it.
   The beauticians, who get $1.50 a day and a free hairdo a month,
must hand in their nurse-like smocks and are searched before they
leave work, said assistant deputy warden Terri Baker.
   No incidents other than minor thefts have been reported,
probably because corrections officers and the civilian
cosmetologist always are watching.
   Beautician Serena Gordon, serving a life term for second-degree
murder, said she's never been threatened with violence by a
customer who didn't like the way her hair turned out.
   She recalled a young woman with black hair who wanted it
frosted.
   ``When I got done, she just started crying,'' Gordon said. ``She
didn't realize it was going to make her look that old.''
   Gordon also gave a professional bleach job to another inmate
whose hair temporarily turned green.
   ``That time,'' she said, ``I cried.''

<HEAD>Alleged Drug Barons Elected to Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alleged drug baron and two men
suspected of opium dealing are members of the new Parliament,
creating speculation that Pakistan's already sluggish anti-drug
campaign may founder.
   Officials say about 30 tons of heroin are shipped from Pakistan
every year. Domestic and foreign narcotics officers have criticized
successive governments for failing to stop the trade.
   ``They have not been able to successfully prosecute and imprison
what you would call a major'' drug figure, a narcotics agent said,
on condition of anonymity.
   The United States, frustrated by the lack of action, has
threatened to cut off more than $500 million in economic and
military aid that already has been frozen because of suspicion that
Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons.
   Ayub Khan Afridi, said to be one of Pakistan's main drug
traffickers, won a National Assembly seat in the Oct. 24 elections.
At least two other successful candidates are suspected of
large-scale involvement in the opium trade.
   A diplomat said, also on condition of anonymity: ``We've told
them, `You have a handful in the National Assembly that everyone
recognizes are ear-deep in the heroin trade. It's only going to get
worse'.
   ``It's the National Assembly that passes the laws, and if
criminals are influencing how the law is written, you can pass some
pretty ineffective laws.''
   In 1983, Afridi was convicted in absentia and sentenced to one
year in jail after failing to show up in court to answer charges of
drug trafficking. Records also show at least five outstanding
arrest warrants on similar charges.
   Several anti-drug agencies in Pakistan and abroad have sought
Afridi's arrest, but with no success. Afridi dismisses the
allegations as a baseless slander campaign conducted by former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during her 20 months in power.
   ``That's rubbish,'' said Zahid Sarfraz, interior minister in the
caretaker government that replaced Ms. Bhutto when she was
dismissed in August. Sarfraz, who was in charge of narcotics
control, said the drug charges against Afridi had nothing to do
with politics.
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's new government created a Narcotics
Ministry and put Rana Chandar Singh in charge.
   Analysts doubt that Singh, a Hindu, will be able to penetrate
the orthodox Moslem tribal country where the drug trade is based.
The diplomat said: ``Perhaps that's why he got the job.''
   Drug raids and arrests are made periodically, and some are
impressive.
   Narcotics agents confiscated more than 3,800 pounds of heroin
with an estimated street value of $130 million an 800 tons of
hashish, chemicals used for making heroin and a cache of
semiautomatic rifles and missile launchers.
   At least one person charged after the raid is a member of the
Baluchistan provincial assembly and of the province's governing
party.
   Such raids are highly publicized, but Pakistani and foreign
narcotics officials say only small-time operators and couriers go
to jail.
   The tribal area, where opium and heroin are produced, is a
lawless strip of rough terrain along the border with Afghanistan
where Pakistani authorities have little authority.
   As one narcotics agent described it: ``The tribal area is a
sanctuary where they can operate virtually with impunity.''
   Sarfraz, the former interior minister, found one of the
outstanding arrest warrants for Afridi shortly before turning the
ministry over to his successor, but could not order the arrest
after he left office.
   In an interview, he said of Afridi: ``Is he bigger than the
government of Pakistan? Either we let the name of the government of
Pakistan be dragged through the mud or we arrest him.''
   Although a spokesman for the Sharif government said Afridi's
arrest was imminent, he apparently is back in the sanctuary of the
tribal area.

<HEAD>Pinochet Still Army Chief, but Political Power Fades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Augusto Pinochet still
is the army commander, but has been losing political ground to
Patricio Aylwin, the elected civilian who succeeded him.
   Even right-wing politicians who supported the 74-year-old
general during his 16{ years of military rule, which ended in
March, are saying he should stay out of politics.
   The annual revision of the armed forces high command this month
gave Aylwin the opportunity for a clear demonstration of his
political authority.
   For the first time since the political coup that brought him to
power in 1973, the makeup of the high command was not determined by
Pinochet alone.
   Aylwin vetoed the promotions of two generals. Pinochet
challenged his right to do so but Aylwin was upheld by the General
Comptroller's office, which rules on the legality of government
decisions.
   Pinochet retained command of the army after leaving the
presidency, under a clause in the 1980 constitution the military
regime wrote, and Aylwin cannot fire him.
   Before the transfer of power, aides to Aylwin predicted the
general would retain great political authority and threaten Chile's
newly restored democratic rule. That has not happened.
   Most observers acknowledge Pinochet's power has faded, for
several reasons: a financial scandal involving army officers,
Aylwin's skillful handling of relations with the military and the
disciplined, non-political attitude of the other service
commanders.
   In occasional comments to reporters, Pinochet insists he now is
``totally out of politics,'' but some of his public actions suggest
otherwise.
   Last May, he publicly criticized Aylwin's establishment of a
commission to investigate human rights abuses under the military
regime.
   In response, Aylwin summoned the general to the presidential
palace and rejected the ``political connotations'' of his remarks.
   Later, Pinochet caused an international incident by saying the
German army was made up in part of ``marijuana smokers, drug
addicts, longhairs, hommosexuals and unionists.''
   After Aylwin condemned the comments, Pinochet withdrew them and
apologized.
   On Sept. 11, the 17th anniversary of the coup, Pinochet caused a
political uproar by saying he would do it again under the same
circumstances.
   Even some old supporters are putting distance between themselves
and the general, saying he has has no legitimate political role.
   ``Gen. Pinochet is no longer a political option in Chile,'' said
Sebastian Pinera, a leading right-wing senator.
   Another senator, who was an ambassador under Pinochet, sided
with Aylwin in the dispute over the high command. Pro-goverment
politicians who once feared the continued presence of Pinochet as
army commander now say they may have been wrong.
   ``Pinochet is not yet checkmated, but he is nearing the end of
his match,'' said Camilio Escalona, a Socialist congressman.
   Loyalty to Pinochet and support for him are believed to be firm
in the army, but only in his militare capacity.
   Aylwin told an interviewer on state television he does not think
he will have trouble with the army, and said of Pinochet:
   ``I understand that he who ruled the country as an absolute
master for nearly 17 years now has trouble accommodating to his new
role, subordinated to the president of the republic and to the
minister of defense.''
   The conflict with Aylwin on the high command caught Pinochet in
a weakened position. A congressional commission is investigating an
army payment to one of his sons of the equivalent of $3 million,
apparently for the purchase of a metallurgy plant.
   Newspapers have reported in recent weeks on an illegal savings
and loan organization in which several army officers participated.
   Many Chileans expect a decisive moment in relations between
Pinochet and the civilian government in February, when the
commission investigating human rights abuses issues its final
report.
   Trials are expected to result, many of them involving military
officers.
   Before leaving office, Pinochet said repeatedly he would not
accept trials of military men on human rights issues.

<HEAD>When Bad News is Good News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yes, there is a future for homeowners distressed
by falling housing prices, and oddly the good news is the bad news.
   The latest report on housing starts was even weaker than glum
forecasters had anticipated, falling to an annual rate of just 1.04
million units in October, a level not seen since the deep recession
of 1981-1982.
   It was also the ninth straight month of contraction in the rate,
which has fallen 27 percent this year alone, bringing the latest
level of new housing construction to half the rate that existed in
1978.
   That's only part of the bad news. Among the other elements of a
miserable housing picture are declining economic confidence,
layoffs and job insecurity, and various unknowns associated with a
recessionary economy.
   The good news is that housing and real estate are cyclical, the
down cycle generally creating conditions for the next up cycle.
When current construction fails to meet demographic needs it tends
to strengthen future demand.
   That situation may not exist now, because too much housing may
have been built in the 1980s and because growth in the lower age
level of homebuyers has slowed. But should the low rate persist, it
could lead to future shortages.
   Almost every homeowner understands the supply-demand factor
because it made such an impression on 1980 markets. Denied a chance
to buy because of high interest rates in the 1970s, homebuyers
swamped the market in the mid-1980s.
   The supply-demand equation was upset by the rush of buyers,
which in some regions reached levels never seen before. As so often
occurs in housing, builders caught up with the demand just as it
was headed back down again.
   If the current downturn persists well into next year, a change
in the equation could occur again. Artificial incentives to build,
such as big tax deductions, have been removed from the marketplace,
making it a less attractive area of enterprise. It could mean
starts will be slow to rebound.
   Still another factor might develop - it is being widely forecast
- in the form of lower interest rates. History has shown a very
direct correlation between falling interest rates and rising
housing sales.
   How much rates are likely to fall is now one of the biggest
guessing games in the entire marketplace. Historically, a slowdown
of economic activity brings down interest rates, too, but don't
expect any plunge.
   Among the reasons why:
   - The United States has borrowed a lot of money from foreigners,
and it behooves the Federal Reserve to be wary of the exodus of
dollars because of low returns.
   - Continuing inflation fears.
   - Too much existing debt.
   But what seems to be a growing number of economists are
convinced that America has had its fill of debt, that the desire
for it has been muted by the dangers, and that borrowing as a way
of life will decline.
   One economist, Robert Barbera of Sherson Lehman Bros., even
foresees an ``anti-debt environment.'' He refers to ``debt's
demise'' and ``the ending of the 30-year debt cycle.'' If so,
interest rates should fall.
   The news has indeed been bad for homeowners who cannot sell
their houses or cannot afford their interest payments. But if the
past is a criterion and the forecasts can be believed, better times
are coming.

<HEAD>City's Last Family Farm Hangs on in Queens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Klein weeds a row of beets and white
radishes with a turn-of-the-century, wood-and-iron push hoe.
Nearby, tall zucchini plants sprout limp yellow blossoms. His
mother, Barbara, sells corn, cucumbers, tomatoes and fruit to
passers-by from a stand on the street.
   This is New York City's last family farm, two green acres in the
Fresh Meadows section of Queens, surrounded by small brick
apartment houses, an elementary school, paved ball court, and a
broad street noisy with buses and traffic from nearby expressways.
   ``A couple of weeks ago, these guys from Florida got off the
Clearview Expressway and came down the street asking directions,
and they couldn't believe there was a farm in the middle of Queens.
They thought they were in the Twilight Zone,'' said Klein, 25, a
fourth-generation farmer.
   The two acres - slightly bigger than a square city block, with a
chain-link fence on three sides and a lawn and tall oaks in front -
are all that's left of a 100-acre spread that was sold off piece by
piece over the years.
   The Kleins grow beets, carrots, scallions, radishes, basil,
dill, parsley, cucumbers, squash, and kohlrabies - ``stuff that
doesn't need that much room to grow,'' Klein explained.
   The rows are so short, he has to weed them by hand. ``It's too
small to use a tractor,'' he said. ``By the time you got there,
you'd have to turn it around.''
   But the family also grows corn, melons and produce that needs
more space on 100 acres in Riverhead, on Long Island's eastern tip.
It's trucked in each day to the farm stand.
   Open July to November, seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
the farm stand on 195th Street and 73rd Avenue does a brisk
business.
   ``In Queens, to find a farmer's market, this is really an
oasis,'' said Sylvia Ehrlich as she examined tomatoes.
   ``I come here all the time - the stuff is delicious,'' agreed
Michael Morache, who was buying zucchinis.
   Freshness is key. ``I go out and pick it in the morning and by
the end of the day, it's home in their refrigerator,'' said Klein.
``We run out and pick the basil and dill and parsley right away for
people because if you leave it out for a half-hour, it gets
wilted.''
   His great-grandfather, Adam, began farming in Fresh Meadows in
the 1890s. His great-aunts, Margaret and Stella, live in two brick
houses on the remaining two acres.
   Why keep the Queens land, when the family owns 100 acres in
Riverhead?
   ``It's definitely a tradition, but it's making a living also,''
said Klein. ``If you go out to Riverhead, on every corner there's a
farmstand. But we're the last ones here.''
   Certainly Queens is better known as home to the Mets, Archie
Bunker and 2 million of the city's 7.5 million residents than as an
agricultural community.
   But Queens, like the other four boroughs, has a rich farming
past dating to the 1600s. Only in the 1800s did industry and
housing begin to replace open space around the city. Narrow,
winding streets in Lower Manhattan recall cowpaths. Bleecker Street
in Greenwich Village harks back to the Bleecker Farm of colonial
times. In the 1830s, trains chugged ``through miles of rocky
wasteland overrun by pigs and goats'' from what is now Little Italy
up to Harlem, according to the Works Progress Administration Guide
to New York City.
   Small farms - called truck farms because their produce was
trucked into urbanized areas to be sod - remained common in
Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx until after World War
II, when developers gobbled up land to build housing.
   Henry Ludder, the Queens borough historian, recalled cutting
across vegetable fields as he walked home from school in Bayside,
Queens, in the early 1940s. ``I can remember pulling a carrot or a
beet out of the ground, rubbing the dirt off on my pants and
chewing it as I went along,'' he said.
   About 20 farmhouses dating from 1679 through 1871 around the
city are designated landmarks; most are owned by historical
societies. Two - the Queens County Farm Museum in Floral Park, and
the Decker Farm, owned by the Staten Island Historical Society -
remain working farms.
   But the Klein enterprise is the last family owned farm within
city limits. Even the Klein farm in Riverhead is one of a vanishing
breed.
   ``I imagine another 25 years, Riverhead will be like here, and
you'll be out there writing about the last farm,'' said Klein's
father, also John, 47.
   After Adam Klein sold most of the Queens property, he bought
farmland in Hicksville, Long Island, and then was pushed out
further east to Melville, and again out to Riverhead.
   ``I guess we can't go too much further or else we'll be in the
ocean,'' said the younger Klein.
   ``There's no farms in Hicksville now and there's only four or
five farms left out in Melville and property is worth a million
dollars an acre out there, so the guys holding it are just dumb,''
his father said.
   Would he consider selling the two acres in Queens?
   ``If I didn't want to farm anymore, I'd just plant it with
grass, put a big swimming pool in the back,'' he said. ``If you
don't have to sell it, why sell it?''

<HEAD>Gossip-Loving James Beard Heats Up Foodies' Gossip Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Beard, often called the dean of American
food, rose early most days. Not to get to the markets or his stove,
but to talk on the telephone - a morning constitutional of gossip
that could last two hours.
   Now Beard himself, five years after his death at 81, is at the
center of a roiling kettle of gossip.
   Fermenting the gossip is a pair of biographies, both a tribute
to his pivotal role in the development of an American cuisine. One
of the books is a celebration; the other is a portrait ``warts and
all.''
   ``There is a `bonfire of the foodies' quality about this,'' said
Robert Clark, who is writing a third biography of Beard. ``These
are all good-hearted people who are competing to sit on his throne
and then competing for status and stature in the food business.''
   Beard was the genius behind the ``discovery'' of American
cooking, reveling in the fine preparation of simple, local
ingredients - the same qualities that have become watchwords of
good eating in this country. Many people who knew him called him a
``walking encyclopedia'' of gastronomy. Food, he preached, should
always be fun.
   He gave up hope of a career in the opera after nodes developed
on his vocal cords, and turned to acting, but soon found few parts
for a man his size (6-foot-4 and 200 to 300 pounds), according to
Evans Jones' book, ``Epicurean Delight.''
   So he brought drama to an early love - food.
   ``Like theater, offering food to people is a matter of
showmanship, and no matter how simple the performance, until you do
it well, with love and originality, you have a flop on your
hands,'' he once wrote.
   Stylish and outgoing, Beard also had a remarkable ability to
attract all sorts of people willing to help him cook, write,
organize his life and, in later years, get around.
   ``James gave to everybody; but the bargain implied giving in
return,'' wrote Barbara Kafka, the editor of the other Beard book,
``The James Beard Celebration.''
   ``People would do unbelievable things for Jim in work and in
personal service, things he accepted with such ease and lack of
self-consciousness that any notion of burden was eschewed,'' she
wrote.
   Beard traveled frequently and found friends, students and
colleagues everywhere he spent time: Oregon, California, New York,
London and France. There were cooks, restaurateurs, writers,
childhood friends, theater, movie and opera people.
   He wrote 22 books and countless newspaper and magazine articles,
consulted for restaurants, catered, opened cooking schools, and was
a spokesman for kitchen equipment and food products. He was a
pioneer of backyard cooking and of television cooking shows, though
he lacked Julia Child's affinity for the camera.
   ``To oversimplify matters, he was the person who almost
single-handedly transformed America's eating habits from salt and
pepper and ketchup on the table to much more complex pleasures,''
said George Lang, owner of the New York restaurant Cafe des
Artistes, and also a food columnist and friend of Beard's for 35
years.
   Until Beard, cooking in America was essentially European, said
Kafka, whose book is full of reminiscences and recipes from those
who knew Beard.
   Her book is an invitation to join Beard and his friends and
their food, and was published to raise money for the James Beard
Foundation, established four years ago in Beard's Greenwich Village
townhouse by Child, Peter Kump, its president, and others.
   The foundation offers workshops, book parties, dinners and
exhibits of food photography and art. A scholarship program is
expected to begin granting money next year.
   ``Both books are really quite wonderful in their own way,'' Lang
said. ``The question is what you're interested in. If you're
interested in recipes for your main course, then Barbara Kafka's
book will be for you, and the anecdotes will be dessert.'' The
opposite is true for Jones' book.
   Clark, who edits the Journal of Gastronomy, said his book will
include no recipes, but will be ``the story of American food over a
100-year period as told through the life of James Beard.''
   Beard grew up an only child in Oregon, where his mother had run
a hotel and where she instilled in him her fascination with fine
food.
   ``I cooked fairly seriously by the time I was 14 and 15,'' Beard
is quoted as saying in Kafka's book. ``I never really learned. I
had a funny feeling that I could take something I ate and reproduce
it - like a musician with music.''
   It was a time Beard also documented, in ``Delights and
Prejudices,'' his 1964 memoirs. At least in part, Beard's efforts
to write a sequel inspired Jones and Kafka.
   ``He apparently tried to break his writing block with several
people,'' said Kump, a Beard friend who opened Peter Kump's New
York Cooking School.
   Jones' wife and editor, Judith Jones of Alfred A. Knopf Inc.,
said Beard made some tapes with her husband, which became material
for his book. And Kafka's book begins with a transcript of a tape
he made with her.
   Beard the gossip might have delighted in Beard the topic of
gossip, friends said.
   Jones writes of friendships that fell apart, business
difficulties and the effects of Beard's domineering mother.
   Some people were unhappy that both books mention Beard's
homosexuality, Clark said.
   In Kafka's book, Beard himself brings it up, in a tape he made,
saying, ``By the time I was 7, I knew that I was gay. I think it's
time to talk about that how.''
   Jones has heard the accusation that his book is homophobic,
perhaps in part because the subject is introduced in a footnote.
But he insisted he was merely being discreet, and that Beard's
sexuality is irrelevant.
   ``There is a strong feeling of wanting to protect his memory and
wanting to inherit his reputation on the part of a lot of people,''
Clark said. ``He made people feel like he was totally theirs. And I
think the world is full of people who feel that they knew him
best.''
   ``We didn't quite know how sticky that would be,'' Mrs. Jones
said.
   Kafka won't discuss Jones' book. Asked why, she said, ``Have you
read it to the end?''
   In the final chapter, Jones describes her as a writer who at the
time she and Beard met, may have known more about ``courts of
intrigue than she did about the world of food.''
   ``I haven't read what Barbara calls her book,'' Jones said.
   But beyond the gossip and the disagreements, Kump said, it's
important that so much is being written about Beard.
   ``Jim made a tremendously significant contribution to gastronomy
in this country,'' Kump said.
   And, he noted, all but two of Beard's own books are back in
print.

<HEAD>Golden State Praying For Rain, But Bracing for Fifth Drought Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first few storms of the rainy season have
arrived in California, bringing a little moisture and a torrent of
hope that the state will dodge a disastrous fifth year of drought.
   The four-year drought, the worst in 60 years in some areas,
already has cost the nation's most populous state hundreds of
millions of dollars in losses, hitting farmers the hardest.
   Worst-case scenarios for another dry year call for business
shutdowns, heavy crop damage, wildlife losses and devastating brush
fires. Lawmakers also envision one of the fiercest water wars in
state history between cities and farmers.
   The state's top weather forecasters have been running numbers
through their computers all summer, and the best they can come up
with is that nobody knows what the winter will bring.
   ``The only thing left is to appeal to the higher being to bless
us with rain,'' said Ralph Klages, a nursery owner in the Los
Angeles suburb of Monterey Park. ``It's frustrating and it's scary,
because we have a lot to lose.''
   The rainy season, which began Nov. 1, has gotten off to an
unsettling start.
   A series of mid-November storms people hoped would dump lots of
rain and snow petered out, leaving precipitation levels in most
areas well below seasonal averages.
   Even in the absence of storm clouds, many Californians see a
silver lining. Water experts say the drought might accelerate water
management plans to avoid the day fast-growing California wants
more water than it can get.
   But many of the solutions - from additional water storage to
desalination plants - are too far in the future to help most
Californians, who are bracing for the worst if the winter of 1991
comes up dry.
   In the Southern California mountains, ski lift operators who
have had to make do with small snow packs in the past worry that
shrinking water supplies could even keep them from making fake
snow.
   ``We haven't had a good snow winter in a few years,'' said
Monica Bandows with Bear Mountain Ski Resort near Big Bear Lake.
``But now there is a chance that if the lake falls below a certain
level, we'll no longer be able to pull water out for man-made
snow.''
   Ron Klievoneit, who operates French Gulch Marina on Lake
Isabella in Kern County, said business has declined 25 percent
since the lake level dropped. Some store owners have gone out of
business, he said.
   ``A lot of them have not had enough of a cushion and have gone
defunct,'' said Klievoneit. ``We've owned this place for nearly 10
years. We've been successful at it. And I will just have to find
ways to be successful for years to come.''
   Farmers also could have to find a way to get through another dry
year.
   Agriculture suffered an estimated $480 million in
drought-related losses this year, according to the state Department
of Water Resources.
   In California, farmers get their water from several sources,
including their own wells and state and federal water projects.
   Unless the 1991 water year is wetter than last season, farmers
could have their government water supplies cut by one-half to
two-thirds, federal and state officials say.
   ``Tree crop farmers are having particular problems,'' said Mike
Henry, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation in
Sacramento. ``Last year, they started seeing trees beginning to
stress. The roots are searching for water and they're not finding
any. The tree itself starts to change its metabolism to survive and
not produce fruit.''
   Urban residents also face water cutbacks. State deliveries could
drop as much as 13 percent and federal deliveries could decline 25
percent to 50 percent, officials said.
   Some cities already have imposed rationing, most notably Santa
Barbara on the hard-hit Central Coast, where some residents paint
their dead lawns green and wash their cars with dry rags. That area
has no access to government water supplies and relies solely on
local sources.
   Los Angeles, the state's largest city, had voluntary water
conservation this summer. After early success, the water use inched
back up near the end of summer, and mandatory rationing next summer
could be imposed.
   A cut in water supplies to industrial users would be
devastating. A 24 percent reduction could cost Los Angeles industry
$25 billion and 350,000 jobs, according to estimates by William S.
Wade, a consultant to the Metropolitan Water District, a Southern
California water broker.
   Electronics manufacturers, for instance, rely heavily on water,
and even a small cutback in their already tight supply could force
them to reduce production.
   With water in short supply, the competition could turn ugly.
Some lawmakers say Southern Californians could lobby state and
federal water authorities to pressure central California farmers
into giving up more of their supplies.
   ``It could get very cannibalistic for awhile,'' said Assemblyman
Jim Costa, D-Fresno.
   Humans aren't the only ones who suffer in a drought. In the
Angeles National Forest, the drought is hurting wildlife by drying
up water sources and making the plants less nutritious.
   Mule deer are having fewer fawns, black bears are coming down
from the hills to the campgrounds looking for food and water, and
smaller, less mobile animals such as wood rats and ground squirrels
are dying, said forest biologist Bill Brown.
   Animals also have gone beyond the campgrounds and into
neighborhoods. In San Diego County, people have reported foxes
eating cat food, raccoons slurping pool water and bobcats lurking
around jogging trails.
   The dry brush also increases the possibility of wildfire. The
state had one of its worst fires in history this summer when
hundreds of homes were destroyed in a Santa Barbara area fire.
   Water officials say they have no idea how much precipitation the
state can expect this winter. But even a normal winter won't solve
all the state's problems, they say. Experts say the state needs a
wetter-than-normal winter, and even a second normal winter.
   ``If we get a normal water year, we can make all the state water
deliveries,'' said state Water Resources engineer Bob Fingado.
``However, that would leave our reservoirs at the same level, and
that's low.''
   And even after the state gets out of the current drought,
California's problems aren't over. The population explosion is
straining the basic water system.
   Officials now are drafting long-term water plans, including
better conservation, improving the coordination between water
agencies and finding ways to reuse water.
   California could become the leader in building plants that make
sea water drinkable. Although a very expensive source of fresh
water, desalination facilities are under construction or in the
planning stages in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Marin counties.
   ``This drought should really serve to be a wake-up call for all
of us,'' said Byron Buck, director of water resources planning for
San Diego County.

<HEAD>Beijing Prepares for Exercise in Socialist Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The campaign season for local government offices
in Beijing opened with plenty of hoopla. The city Communist Party
chief shook hands at the main department store.
   A brass band played. Vans with loudspeakers cruised city streets
and, the official Xinhua News Agency reported, volunteers gave out
1 million pamphlets.
   Only the candidates were missing.
   They are chosen weeks later, but there is no suspense for
voters. Only members or supporters of the ruling party are
nominated. Incumbents who supported last year's pro-democracy
movement already have been purged.
   ``It's like taking part in a play ... performed for the
Communist Party,'' a woman voter said, on condition of anonymity.
``We don't put much value on our voting rights.''
   For the Communists, the elections are a deadly serious play, the
basis of their claim to be the people's choice.
   All other officials are appointed in some fashion, so China's
assertion of democracy rests entirely upon popular elections held
every three years for the lowest-level representative bodies:
district people's congresses in urban areas and county people's
congresses in the countryside.
   The congresses make no laws and function mainly as conduits for
passing citizen complaints and ideas to higher levels. Beijing has
18 such congresses with a total of 17,000 delegates.
   Other parts of the country held elections in the spring, but
balloting in Beijing was delayed until Dec. 26. The reason given
was that everyone was too busy getting ready for the Asian Games,
held in September.
   Officials also may have wanted to keep the elections from
coinciding with the anniversary of Beijing's massive pro-democracy
demonstrations, which the army crushed in June 1989. Among other
things, the marchers wanted more say in picking government
officials.
   Voters say they have little part even in choosing the local
congresses. ``God knows how the candidates are chosen,'' the woman
said.
   After the single burst of citywide publicity that opened the
election season in late October, preparations reverted to
closed-door committees that take nominations from such official
groups as the Communist Youth League and All-China Women's
Association.
   A group of at least 10 voters can put a candidate forward, but
few do. The candidate would be unable to organize publicity
activities and would have little chance of success.
   The law allows two candidates for each seat, but voters say
there usually is just one.
   Because there are no competing parties, television ads or
debates, campaigns are placid events. It is not mandatory to vote,
but failure to do so is frowned upon and would be noticed.
   Chinese officials insist the system is more democratic than
multiparty elections in the West, which they say keeps power in the
hands of the rich.
   ``Our election rights may not be the same as in the West, but
equality is a basic principle,'' Xu Jingyu, chairman of the
election commission in Beijing's Chaoyang District, said in an
interview.
   He acknowleged not everyone can run for office, only those with
correct ideological views, but said this was in keeping with the
constitution.
   ``Delegates have to be able to represent the views of the
masses,'' he said. ``How can someone who opposes the (party's) four
basic principles do that?''
   The emphasis on ideological correctness is especially strong
this year, in keeping with the country's conservative turn after
the democracy movement was crushed.
   A public notice addressed to ``comrade voters'' in the Chaoyang
District called for vigilence against ``bourgeois liberals'' who
might seek to sabotage the election. There have been no reports of
any such plots.
   ``Bourgeois liberals'' are people who favor Western-style
democracy with more than one party.
   Xu was unable to explain why some people accused of being
bourgeois liberals were elected to past people's congresses.
   The most prominent example is astrophysicist Fang Lizhi's wife,
Li Shuxian, a physics teacher at Beijing University who shares her
husband's dissident views and was elected in 1987.
   She was expelled from the Haidian District People's Congress in
1989, soon after police accused her and Fang of
counterrevolutionary crimes. They since have been allowed to go to
the West.
   ``People change,'' Xu said. ``Maybe when she was elected, she
didn't have this problem.''

<HEAD>French Women Fight For Law Against Sexual Harassment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the Middle Ages, French feudal lords bedded the
wives of their serfs and called it a nobleman's right. Nowadays,
male executives prey on female employees, but some women are
fighting back.
   It is a new, difficult battle for French women, 70 percent of
whom work outside the home.
   According to a survey by the European Community's executive
commission, 36 percent of working women in France reported being
harassed sexually by bosses or co-workers.
   ``Sexual harassment has been around for centuries, yet it's
still a taboo subject,'' said Marie-Victoire Louis, a sociologist
and co-founder of the Association to Fight Violence Against Women
at Work.
   ``Any woman who brings charges of sexual harassment against her
employer runs the risk of being ridiculed, isolated, not believed,
and, naturally, of being fired, if she hasn't been already.''
   Prospects of better treatment on the job are improving for
women, who make up 41 percent of the work force. The National
Assembly is working on legislation, expected to pass in the spring,
that would make sexual harassment a crime punishable by large fines
and prison terms of two to five years.
   The government agency that monitors women's rights is looking
for ways of changing labor laws to enable inspectors to intervene
in harassment cases and make employers responsible for the security
of female workers.
   ``Only the employer can put an end to sexual harassment,'' Mrs.
Louis said. ``By law, employers are required to provide working
conditions which respect the employees' health and safety, and that
includes an environment free of sexual harassment.''
   She said the campaign against sexual harassment got an
unexpected boost from a satirical film about two female postal
workers who turn the system to their advantage.
   ``Promotion Canape'' (Couch Promotion), written and directed by
Didier Kaminka, has attracted about 1 million viewers since it
opened in October. Xavier Gelin, the producer, said negotiations
were under way for a Hollywood remake.
   ``For me, sexual harassment can be defined as repeated advances
that end up turning into blackmail,'' Kaminka said in an interview.
``Sexual harassment is rampant when there's high unemployment and
young, inexperienced women without specialized training are afraid
to lose their jobs.''
   Kaminka said he spent four months inside the postal service,
where he found the expression ``couch promotion'' to be part of the
vernacular. One scene shows actress Grace de Capitani obtaining a
desirable apartment from the postal service's housing administrator
only after promising sex.
   ``Officials said publicly that everything in the film is
fiction, but I can tell you it's all true,'' Kaminka said.
   Mrs. Louis criticized the film for playing down the violence
that accompanies many acts of sexual harassment.
   In her small office in eastern Paris, she pointed to a pile of
dossiers of women who had been abused verbally and physically,
beaten and raped by their male employers.
   She described Mrs. A., a dental assistant who submitted to her
boss's repeated advances because she had an unemployed husband and
a baby. When she finally rejected him, he reduced her salary,
bullied her and slapped her.
   Charged with assault, he denied sexual harassment and said Mrs.
A. had consented to his attentions. She later withdrew the charges
in exchange for a letter of dismissal and 40,000 francs ($8,000) in
damages.
   Another case involved Mrs. B., 24, hired by a town official who
abused, threatened, raped and blackmailed her for two years.
   Mrs. B. finally went to authorities and the official was charged
with several sex and assault offenses involving other women,
including a minor.
   Despite a statement of support from the mayor, the official was
convicted and sent to jail. He was released, however, and the case
is still pending.
   Fanny-pinching, skirt-chasing males have been French theater
fare for centuries, from Moliere's Tartuffe to the heroes of
slapstick boulevard comedies, but Mrs. Louis said:
   ``There's nothing funny about the abuse of an employer's
power.''

   Americans eat more poultry every year, and the
big chicken processing companies have been reporting record
earnings. But at the production end of this booming business, many
family farmers who raise the birds say they're struggling to get
by. Now they're banding together for bargaining clout and fighting

   Six weeks after delivering thousands of
day-old chicks to Forest Powell's poultry houses, a ConAgra truck
rumbles back to pick up the flock, now grown to four-pound
broilers.
   The process usually is simple. The truck returns to the
processing plant, pulls onto a scale, is unloaded and then weighed
again. The difference determines how much Powell gets paid. It also
can help decide whether he gets another flock, whether he stays in
business.
   Though his birds seemed as plump as ever a few years ago,
Powell's flock weights were mysteriously falling - or so the
records from the ConAgra scales said. He couldn't sleep for
worrying about the debt he owed on his three chicken houses and
equipment, more than $80,000 at the time.
   Powell, consistently a top-rated grower, was told he'd get just
one more batch of chicks, one six-week chance to save his
livelihood. Under his contract, he'd have no appeal.
   ``I could have just lost my whole farm,'' he said.
   Again and again, he and his wife, Dorothy, pored over the
company weight charts, ``and finally we come up with it.''
   What they came up with was evidence of systematic underweighing,
evidence amplified in the trial one year ago of a fraud suit filed
by Powell and 267 other growers for ConAgra, the nation's
second-largest chicken processor.
   Witnesses testified that ConAgra workers hiked the weights of
``empty'' trailers with such tricks as loading them with heavy
steel drainage grates or standing on the scales.
   A U.S. District Court jury in Dothan, Ala., awarded the growers
$13.6 million, including $9 million in punitive damages. It was a
case, said Judge Myron Thompson, of ``the rich seeking to get
richer by stealing from those who could least afford to be stolen
from.'' ConAgra has appealed.
   That isn't the only example of the rich seeking to get richer at
the expense of independent growers, according to some agriculture
officials and growers themselves.
   Companies sometimes lure farmers into making huge investments in
chicken houses with ads boasting of easy money waiting to be made.
But the reality of the business today is that contracts afford
growers no protection against unexpected expenses ordered by the
company, such as extra fans, and no protection against sudden
firing, they say.
   Contracts that companies offer to chicken growers generally run
flock-to-flock and permit termination without stated cause, often
with as little as 20 days' notice.
   ``What you've got,'' said Vreeland G. Johnson, a lawyer for the
growers, ``is a feudal system, almost. These people are at the
total whim and mercy of the processors.''
   Consider:
   - Underweighing and other alleged inequities have prompted
complaints from North Carolina to Texas, the heart of the
broiler-growing belt. ``Everybody has the same problems,
everywhere,'' said Mary Clouse, who edits Poultry Grower News, a
newsletter. ``It's David and Goliath.''
   - State agriculture authorities in Florida, Texas and Minnesota
have zeroed in on contract problems. ``An oligopoly is developing
in which a handful of mega-companies will soon control over 43
percent of the total U.S. poultry meat products market,'' said a
January study by the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   - A lawsuit by fired growers in Louisiana, which ended in a
sealed cash settlement, accused ConAgra of maintaining ``oppressive
and one-sided'' contracts. The suit said that after growers
invested in chicken houses, ConAgra imposed contract terms that
hadn't been previously agreed on. It also contended the company's
standards for production were ``ill-defined.'' ConAgra contended
the fired growers had performed poorly.
   ``We have and have had for a number of years good grower
relationships throughout the country,'' said Lynn Phares, ConAgra's
vice president for public relations. ``We want happy growers. The
vast, vast majority do indicate satisfaction.''
   - In Arkansas, the leading chicken-producing state, 200 growers
turned out in October to organize for better contracts. The meeting
in Nashville, Ark., was a first. ``Growers have been afraid to
speak out for fear of being laid off,'' said Bill Fritts, a leader
of the group.
   Arthur Gaskins, president of the Northeast Florida Broiler
Growers Association, was one who spoke out and got laid off by
Cargill, the Minnesota-based agribusiness conglomerate.
   Gaskins, who had grown chickens for Cargill for nearly two
decades, charged that he was cut off in retaliation for a suit the
growers group filed alleging weight falsifications.
   In April, U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II in Jacksonville,
Fla., ordered Gaskins reinstated. The judge found ``substantial
likelihood'' that the growers would succeed in their claims against
Cargill, including unlawful ``coercion, intimidation and
discrimination against agricultural producers based on the exercise
of their legal rights.''
   No trial date has been set in the case, attorneys said.
   ``We have done nothing to defraud or manipulate growers,'' said
Greg Lauser, a spokesman for Cargill, which is appealing the
injunction and denies intentional wrongdoing. Some improper
weighing was done by ``low-level employees'' who since have been
fired, he said, adding that growers were compensated, with
interest.
   But Gaskins maintains low-level employees are not the problem.
   ``The whole contract system is wrote to benefit the integrator.
It's a take-it-or-leave-it contract,'' the farmer said.
   The industry denies being unfair and insists that relations
between companies and all but a minority of growers are
satisfactory and mutually profitable.
   ``It's not one of these deals where you get rich in a hurry, but
it's been a very stable type of situation where, whether the market
goes up or down, the guy on the farm gets his money - so the market
risk is taken out for him,'' said Bill Roenigk, vice president of
the National Broiler Council, a Washington-based poultry industry
group.
   ``We have a waiting list for growers,'' noted Ms. Phares, the
ConAgra spokeswoman.
   Grower advocates agree that the job can make money, especially
for growers whose chicken house loans are paid and who operate in
areas such as Maryland, where they have a choice of processors to
contract with.
   But most areas of the country don't have much competition among
the chicken processors, so growers are left at the mercy of one
firm. They say their risk comes when they sign 15-year mortgages on
chicken houses that can cost $65,000 each, or make expensive
company-mandated improvements with no guarantees beyond a
seven-week contract.
   Lengthening contract periods to match growers' mortgage periods
was among reforms proposed by the Texas Agriculture Department
study. The report also called for grievance procedures, bonded
weighers and ``flexible contracts with a set minimum operating
margin of profit.'' It found growers' return on a 20,000-bird flock
ranged from $579 to $4,835.
   But money was not the biggest problem the study found. Growers
``have no due process ... and they don't have any recourse and they
don't have many rights,'' said the Texas Agriculture Department's
Richard Salmon.

   In August, a reform law took effect in Minnesota, mandating that
companies give 180 days notice and compensation for cancellation of
an agricultural contract that required an investment of $100,000 or
more. It also established a state office to investigate complaints
and settle disputes.
   The Minnesota law apparently is the first of its kind. Florida
legislators considered a bill after the Gaskins case that would
have required 60 days termination notice.
   After hearing testimony from both sides, including some growers
who said they were happy with present contracts, a committee
shelved the bill. But state Sen. Karen Thurman, the chairwoman,
said it would be reintroduced if companies don't make changes.
   ``You really don't want to get involved with free enterprise,''
she said. ``But at the same time you want to make it fair.''

   Terry Howell figures he got nothing
out of the chicken-growing business except some hard-learned
lessons.
   ``I lost everything I had,'' said Howell, 32, who borrowed about
$100,000 at age 19 to set himself up with chicken houses,
equipment, a pickup truck and a trailer home for himself and his
new wife.
   ``I lost my vehicle, my house, my land. Everything.'' He and his
wife divorced ``because of the money problems.'' At one point, he
said, they pawned their television for cash to buy groceries.
   When he went into the chicken business, Howell was following his
father, who cosigned on his loan. The younger Howell insists he
built chicken houses and conducted his business just as required by
the company he contracted with, ConAgra.
   He blames his failure on underweighing of the flocks he raised.
He is one of 268 chicken growers who sued ConAgra and won $13.6
million last year.
   ConAgra has appealed, denying any intentional wrongdoing and
saying it compensated growers fairly when the weighing mistakes
were discovered.
   Howell would like to use his share of the award, which averaged
nearly $51,000 for each grower, to go to college ``and pick up
something that I can make good money at. ... I was totally relying
on the chicken business.''
   Even without weighing problems, such reliance is a mistake,
grower advocates say.
   Farmers considering the business should be skeptical, they say,
of company promises. A Perdue Farms ad published last year in a
Maryland newspaper announced in large type: ``This Investment Comes
Complete With a $218,000 Security Blanket.''
   Perdue spokesman Brian Taws said the figure represents revenue
for 444 production weeks - more than eight years. He declined to
comment on complaints about the ad.
   Gregg Wilbanks, who runs a Louisiana financial consulting firm
for farmers, spoke to potential chicken house investors at a recent
meeting sponsored by a bank. ``A lot of people had the idea they
could quit work and make a lot of money,'' he said.
   But on a typical loan for a chicken house, Wilbanks calculates
$11,750 in annual payments to subtract from $18,000 revenue. Other
expenses will leave the farmer about $1,500 annually per house, he
said.
   Although business tax deductions can raise the bottom line,
Wilbanks said, ``It's not a full-time job unless you've got 15 or
20 houses. ... It's a good sideline income.''

   Every week, 115 million chickens are slaughtered to feed the
U.S. appetite for cordon bleu, McNuggets and everything in between,
according to the National Broiler Council, a poultry industry
group.
   Driven largely by a demand for lower-cholesterol, lower-fat
meat, poultry consumption has grown to 73 pounds a year per person,
up from 49.7 pounds a decade ago, said Bill Roenigk, vice president
for the Washington-based council. Beef consumption has fallen
during the same period from 76.4 pounds per person to a projected
67.4 pounds this year.
   The top 10 broiler chicken producing states, in order, are
Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Mississippi, Texas,
Delaware, Maryland, California and Virginia.
   About 25,000 farmers raise the chickens, nearly all under
contracts with processing companies.
   Tyson Foods is by far the largest processor, handling 75 million
of the 400 million pounds processed weekly, the broiler council
said. The next largest are ConAgra, 30 million pounds; Gold Kist,
25 million; Perdue, 25 million; and Pilgrim's Pride, 15 million.
Cargill ranks 21st at 4.5 million pounds per week.

<HEAD>Actor Playing `The Flash' Wanted More Substance Than a Red Suit</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he was cast in the CBS series ``The
Flash,'' John Wesley Shipp said he had second thoughts about
playing a fantasy superhero in bright tights.
   ``One of the issues I wanted to address before I took the job
was how much time he spent out of the costume,'' said Shipp, who
was selected from about 50 actors who auditioned.
   ``When I first heard about `The Flash,' I said, `No thanks.' I
thought I'd just be running around in a union suit. But they are
taking the character of Barry Allen, his alter ego, very seriously,
so there is something in it for me as an actor. It has a fantasy
element, but we also try to deal with social issues. We've done
shows about drug addiction and the homeless.''
   Nevertheless, the attraction of the new CBS show, airing
Thursday nights, is the fantasy of the Flash's incredible speed -
and the startling special effects that make it look real.
   Other comic book heroes have found success in television,
including ``Superman,'' ``Batman,'' ``The Incredible Hulk'' and
``Wonder Woman.''
   But ``Captain America'' and ``The Amazing Spider-Man'' were less
successful, and ``The Flash'' is struggling to find an audience.
   ``The Flash'' comic book made its first appearance in January
1940, but never achieved the fame or the appeal of such comic book
classics as ``Superman'' and ``Batman'' and disappeared by 1950.
   It was revived - and modernized - in 1956, and the CBS series is
based on that version. A third incarnation currently is running in
comic books.
   ``The Flash'' also is Barry Allen, a young scientist who comes
from a family of Irish policemen. Allen's father is none too happy
that he hasn't become a policeman, too.
   ``One of the things I liked is that when Barry gets the super
powers in a laboratory accident, his first reaction isn't, `OK, I'm
going to save the world,' '' Shipp said. ``He goes to another
scientist, played by Amanda Pays, and asks her what it means. He
worries that it might mean premature aging. He decides to use the
powers after his policeman brother is killed.''
   Shipp said he thinks some comic book characters have been
treated in a ludicrous manner by television.
   ``You have to create a world of your own,'' he said. ``You can't
put a guy in a red suit with wings on his head on Hollywood
Boulevard.
   ``I don't want `The Flash' to become a vigilante. I don't want
him to abuse the power. I'm after the writers to explore its
effects on Barry. Some people just want to make it the good guys
vs. the bad guys.''
   The show is expensive: The pilot cost $6.5 million, and each
episode costs $1.4 million, Shipp said.
   A great deal of the technical wizardry goes into making
superhuman speed look authentic.
   ``We walk a thin line between something that can be
sophisticated and something that can be laughable,'' Shipp said.
   ``We do a lot of night shooting. We use a lot of wet streets and
reflected lights. You have to be careful how you use the suit. To
me, it has to be used as a visual effect. It has to be carefully
lit and photographed.''
   The look of ``The Flash'' is a mixture of vintage styles with
the 1990s, completely omitting the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The
wardrobes combine long coats and fedoras from the 1930s with
contemporary clothes. The vehicles are from the '30s, '40s, '50s
and '90s.
   The look of speed comes from an unusual smear effect. It
requires a long exposure of the main scene and a second film in
which Shipp re-creates his movements exactly in front of a blue
screen. The two images then are combined on digital videotape to
give the appearance he's moving at 600 mph while everyone else is
moving at normal speed.
   The special suit Shipp wears is a type of body appliance that
gives him an imposing, heavily muscled appearance. It's in 30
pieces and takes about 30 minutes to put on. And it's so hot that
it's equipped with a cooling system.
   Before beginning ``The Flash,'' Shipp played the father in the
sequel to the film ``The NeverEnding Story.'' He also worked in
such soap operas as ``The Guiding Light,'' ``As the World Turns''
and ``Santa Barbara.''
   ``The sequel takes the father-son relationship further,'' he
said of ``The NeverEnding Story.''
   ``It's funny. In that father-son relationship, I was the father.
In `The Flash,' I'm the son in the father-son relationship. The
actor in `The NeverEnding Story' who plays my son, Jonathan
Brandes, plays a street kid in the `Flash' episode we're shooting
now.''

<HEAD>No Evidence of Speculative Mania in 1970s Farmland Runup, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If, instead of heading for Las Vegas, a
high-roller in 1980 bought a typical acre of U.S. farmland for $750
in hopes of turning a fast buck, the profit would hardly have been
the stuff of a gambler's dreams.
   The speculator could have sold the one acre in 1982 for a record
$823. That would have been a profit of less than 5 percent a year.
   But it would have been a profit. And there are more losers than
winners at roulette tables.
   After the U.S. farmland boom of the 1970s peaked in 1982,
however, it was downhill for years, with the bottom in 1987 at an
average of $599 per acre.
   By 1990, according to the Agriculture Department, farm real
estate prices nationally - including buildings as well as land -
had recovered to around $693 per acre.
   These are only averages. No doubt there have been some
speculative land deals that have resulted in somebody getting rich.
   But did speculators help run up farmland prices in the 1970s so
much that the bottom was bound to fall out of the market in the
1980s?
   A USDA analysis says it is doubtful that speculation and easy
credit policies led to the farmland bust. There is little doubt,
however, that the slide in land prices was a huge factor in the
financial crunch that gripped the nation's agriculture in the
mid-1980s.
   Land is the main asset of farmers, and when values crumbled
their collateral shrank, and so did their borrowing power.
   ``Many market observers said (farmland) prices reflected a
speculative mania rather than expected farm income,'' the report
said. ``Speculative manias, often called bubbles, occur when
investors buy an asset intending only to sell it later at a higher
price, rather than using it to generate income over a number of
years.''
   The report was written by Fred Kuchler and Abebayehu Tegene of
the department's Economic Research Service and is in the November
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``While there is some circumstantial evidence of a speculative
bubble in the 1970s, the long-run stable relation between farmland
prices and returns (as measured by cash rental rates) leads to the
conclusion that bubbles have most likely not occurred in farmland
markets,'' the report said.
   ``Rather,'' it added, ``expectations about future farm incomes
and other economic factors have determined, and continue to
determine, farmland prices.''
   The report also said that many analysts believe ``aggressive
lending policies touched off a speculative bubble in farmland
prices'' during the 1970s.
   ``That conclusion appears to be incorrect, but the evidence does
not rule out the possibility that aggressive lending, reflected in
lower mortgage rates or greater volumes of credit, could have
caused investors to re-evaluate their expectations,'' the report
said. ``The lenders probably made farmland a much better
investment.''
   Recently the American Bankers Association released an
independent study that said a liberalization of Farm Credit System
lending policies nearly 20 years ago led to the boom-and-bust era
in agriculture.
   According to the study, the cooperatively owned Farm Credit
System - which includes federal land bank associations - was
authorized by Congress in 1971 to raise its collateral limit for
farm real estate loans. That meant larger loans to buy land.
   The bankers' study said the liberalization ``unleased a boom in
land prices in rural America that saw the inflation-adjusted value
of farmland nearly double from 1971 to 1980.''
   But the bankers' study said the boom was unsustainable and that
by the mid-1980s the average real value of farmland, after allowing
for inflation, was almost down to its 1971 level.
   The USDA reports it is impossible to prove conclusively that
speculative bubbles exist or do not exist. One reason is that
economists do not agree exactly on how much income should be
attributed to land.
   ``If there was no speculative bubble, the runup in farmland
prices during the 1970s must reflect big shifts in expectations,''
the report said. ``Farmland investors might have believed that farm
income would rise at a faster pace or that income would continue to
rise at the rate of the 1950s and 1960s.''

   Despite economic gloom and higher fuel prices,
American drivers plan to hit the road in higher numbers this
Thanksgiving, but the nation's airlines aren't expecting a similar
surge.
   The American Automobile Association reported Monday that more
people are expecting to drive 100 miles or more for Thanksgiving,
based on a survey of 1,500 adults.
   The airlines, meanwhile, are predicting no improvement over last
year, a discouraging sign for an industry that has been hit hard by
sluggish demand and steady increases in jet fuel prompted by the
Persian Gulf crisis.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Tens of thousands of workers made sick by
asbestos will receive sharply reduced compensation payments from
the Manville trust under a plan to resolve the nation's biggest
product liability case.
   The long-awaited restructuring, unveiled Monday, is designed to
insure payments to victims of lung cancer and other respiratory
ailments, clear a court backlog and create a model for companies
facing huge liabilities for asbestos products.
   The plan includes up to $520 million in new contributions to the
trust by Manville Corp., which was driven into bankruptcy court in
1982 by mounting asbestos lawsuits.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Oil prices rallied sharply on news that Iraq
will send another 250,000 troops into Kuwait.
   Light sweet crude oil, the benchmark blend, had dropped about $1
a barrel in early trading Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders focused on prospects of peace in the gulf. But
prices shot up after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced the
military buildup. Crude settled at $31.50 per barrel for December
delivery contracts, up $1.72.

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - The state oil monopoly plans to
increase its capacity for oil production, from the current 2
million barrels daily to 4.2 million barrels daily by 1996, a
newspaper reported.
   Petroleos de Venezuela's ambitious expansion plans would cost
about $20 billion, according to the daily El Diario de Caracas,
which quoted oil sources on Monday it did not identify. The
newspaper said that while Venezuela's production capacity would
rise to 4.2 million barrels a day, the country would have a
production target of just 3.7 million barrels a day.

   DALLAS (AP) - Greyhound Lines Inc., the nation's largest
intercity bus line that sought bankruptcy protection after a
strike, has filed a reorganization plan that transfers most of the
company's value to creditors and keeps its routes operating.
   The plan, entered Monday in federal bankruptcy court in Corpus
Christi, will reduce Greyhound's debt by $171 million and reshape
its corporate structure. Creditors will receive new common stock
and $165 million in securities under the plan. Equity held by
Greyhound's present owners will be canceled.

   NEW YORK (AP) - CBS Inc. said it expects to post a loss in the
fourth quarter because of a weak advertising market and
unexpectedly large losses on its television broadcasts of major
league baseball.
   The company also said on Monday that it expects lower earnings
from continuing operations for all of 1991 compared with this year.
The glum forecast comes as CBS reportedly planned a meeting with
its affiliates board to propose a reduction in the estimated $160
million the network pays about 200 affiliated stations for carrying
its shows.

   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Floor traders, protesting government
inaction on long-awaited regulatory reforms, have halted stock

outside the two largest Italian markets in Milan and Rome prevented
trading in equity and bonds.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Consumer Products Safety Commission issued
its yearly holiday warning against dangerous toys and said it may
adopt regulations requiring labeling of playthings with small parts
that little children could choke on.
   At its annual toy safety news conference, the commission on
Monday cautioned parents and other shoppers to beware of balloons,
small balls and marbles, as well as small parts, when buying gifts
for the very young. The commission said it received reports of 33
deaths related to toys between January 1989 and September 1990.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Bank examiners investigating a possible
$13 million embezzlement at a bank closed by the state studied the
institution's murky records while police searched for its missing
president.
   A handful of angry depositors showed up at the Heritage Loan and
Investment Co. on Monday demanding their money but were turned away
by state police. Dozens more called, seeking reassurance their
money was safe.
   The state obtained a judge's order putting the two-office bank
into receivership Sunday after a four-day run drained $13.6 million
of its $22.4 million in deposits and weakened a private bank
insurance system.

   Here are some facts, figures and details about
asbestos and the Manville Personal Injury Settlement trust, which
is to be reorganized under a plan presented to a federal judge
Monday.

<HEAD>WHAT IS ASBESTOS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Asbestos is a flaky, white mineral with natural fire, heat and
electrical resistance. It was used widely for decades in various
industries, predominantly shipbuilding, boiler-making and
construction. During World War II, asbestos manufactured by what
was then known as Johns Manville Co. and several other companies
provided the bulk of asbestos used in shipyards nationwide.
Hundreds of thousands of workers were exposed to asbestos, but it
wasn't until the 1970s that a definitive link between the mineral
and severe respiratory diseases including lung cancer was
established. Asbestos today has been removed from public buildings
nationwide.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHO'S LIABLE?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp., which was the nation's leading asbestos maker,
entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings in 1982 because it
couldn't meet its legal liabilities from thousands of asbestos
health lawsuits. The Manville trust was formed as part of the
company's 1988 court reorganization. Dozens of other companies
nationwide face mounting legal problems due to asbestos liability.
Several have entered bankrptcy court, others are financially
burdened by the liability and many are looking to the Manville
settlement as a possible model for resolving claims. Asbestos cases
comprise the biggest product liability issue in U.S. history.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LEGAL HISTORY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Plaintiffs and defendant companies have been wrangling over
asbestos compensation since the mid-1970s and well over $2 billion
has been paid out to workers or their families. Thousands of
claimants have died before being paid. Companies have been held
liable predominantly for a failure to provide adequate health
warnings to workers. Today more than 90,000 asbestos lawsuits crowd
federal and state court dockets nationwide. Mass trials often are
held resolving hundreds of cases at a time. Jury awards have ranged
from nothing to more than $1 million for individual plaintiffs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE TRUST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Manville trust is the biggest claims resolution mechanism in
the country. It was set up with about $3 billion in cash and
Manville securities. The Washington, D.C.-based trust has paid more
than $1.1 billion to settle over 23,000 claims to date. But it has
another 130,000-plus claims pending and faces an estimated 100,000
future claims. Earlier this year the trust declared it had run out
of cash and said some claimants wouldn't get any money until well
into the 21st century. U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
ordered an overhaul of the trust to meet its claims. The trust
blames the cash drain on the fact that it received more claims,
resolved cases faster and paid more than it had expected. Critics
say it was badly managed and squandered its cash.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE PLAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The trust previously had settled cases based on the time of
filing rather than the type of disease and victims' need. The
restructuring scraps that plan, dividing claims into two
categories: serious ailments such as lung cancer and less severe
problems. Claimants will receive only about 45 percent of their
settlements' value. Annual payments will be made, dividing the
total amount owed to a claimant by the total amount of the trust's
available resources. Claimants in the first group will receive
priority during the plan's first two years; the second group won't
receive any payments until the third year of the plan. The plan
caps plaintiffs lawyers' fees at 25 percent of settlements and
dismisses all litigation against the trust. The plan still must be
approved by Weinstein and is expected to face legal appeals from
dissatisfied parties.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHO PAYS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. has agreed to inject an additional $520 million
over seven years into the trust, which owns 80 percent of the
company's common stock. Manville is to pay $280 million in
dividends over four years to the trust and another $240 million in
years four through seven. The trust also holds $1.8 billion in
Manville bonds which it plans someday to sell. Manville is to make
$75 million a year in bond payments to the trust starting next year
and give the trust 20 percent of its annual profits beginning in
1992. Participants in the restructuring envision using the stock
dividends for three years and then selling the bonds and some
common stock to finance payments to victims. All agree there still
is not enough money to meet victims' demands.

<HEAD>Asbestos Fund Restructuring Unveiled, But Opposition Expected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The overhaul of the cash-starved Manville trust
fund is designed to guarantee compensation for tens of thousands of
American workers made sick by asbestos, but payments aren't likely
to resume for a year or more.
   The proposed restructuring, unveiled Monday, slashes fees for
plaintiffs lawyers and ensures at least some payment to all
claimants within three years of its enaction.
   But the plan, submitted to U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein, already is being criticized by some attorneys for
plaintiffs and companies with asbestos liability. A key victims'
advocacy group also said it will oppose the reorganization.
   ``It is a terrible compromise,'' said Heather Maurer, executive
director of the Asbestos Victims of America, an advocacy group for
18,000 victims based in Soquel, Calif. ``I don't think giving an
individual $3,000 or $4,000 is in any way just compensation for
their diseases and deaths.''
   The restructuring effort is designed to help resolve the biggest
product liability issue in U.S. history.
   Asbestos, once considered a miracle fiber, has caused thousands
of deaths from lung cancer and other ailments, and resulting
lawsuits have sent several companies into bankruptcy court and
strangled court dockets nationwide.
   The Manville trust is the biggest asbestos health claims
resolutions mechanism. Formed as part of Manville Corp.'s 1988
bankruptcy reorganization, the trust has paid more than $1.1
billion to settle about 23,000 claims since its formation in 1988.
But it faces another 130,000-plus claims and was ordered
restructured after running out of cash earlier this year.
   The restructuring plan calls for paying claimants based on the
severity of their illnesses. Cancer and other serious diseases are
in one group, with lesser ailments in the second.
   The plan caps lawyers' fees at 25 percent of clients'
settlements and orders dismissal of tens of thousands of lawsuits
against the trust. Both steps should produce hundreds of millions
of dollars more for plaintiffs.
   Its architects defend the plan as the only way to deal with a
severe cash drain during the trust's first two years of operation,
when it settled claims on a first-come, first-served basis.
   ``There is not enough money to compensate everybody as if the
funds were unlimited,'' said Christopher Placitella, a Woodbridge,
N.J., plaintiffs lawyer who helped negotiate the plan. ``The
objective is that hopefully everyone will be treated equally.''
   The plan is certain to face opposition. Weinstein today is
expected to appoint an independent outside reviewer and schedule
court hearings in New York, New Orleans, Chicago and San Francisco
for within 60 days.
   Payments will remain suspended until the restructuring takes
effect. In addition to the hearings, potentially lengthy court
appeals are expected that lawyers said could take a year or more.
   The plan was approved by a committee of plaintiffs lawyers by
5-2. The dissenting attorneys argued that the plan treats claimants
with lesser illnesses unfairly by deferring their payments.
   The trust also is to rely on its 80 percent ownership of
Manville stock for funding after the first three years of the plan.
If the depressed stock price doesn't rise, the trust's assets will
be hurt severely.
   Lawyers for companies with large asbestos liabilities said the
plan attempts to increase other defendants' payments to victims by
prohibiting juries from learning the size of Manville settlements.
   It also will make other companies pay full settlements to
plaintiffs then wait in line to collect the trust's share.
Manville, once the nation's largest asbestos maker, via the trust
generally has been assessed the largest share of jury settlements.
   ``The net effect is reducing Manville's share and trying to make
the other companies pay more than their fair share,'' said Andrew
Berry, a Newark, N.J., lawyer for several defendants.
   Payments would be made annually to claimants based on a
percentage of the trust's available resources.
   Claimants are to receive a maximum 45 percent of settlements
until all claims are at least partially met. Manville trust
payments have averaged about $43,000, but are forecast to fall more
than half for serious diseases and even more for less severe
ailments under the new scheme.
   Payments would be made only to an estimated 23,000 first-group
claimants during the plan's first two years. The group includes
relatives of workers who died before being compensated.
   The more than 100,000 claims in the second group would begin
receiving payment in the plan's third year. Payments are to be made
first to those with hardships, then according to disease severity,
then to claimants over 70 years old and finally to those who filed
first.
   Payments to all Manville claimants except those with urgent
health or financial needs were suspended in July.
   The Washington, D.C.-based trust originally was funded with
about $3 billion in cash and Manville securities. Manville, a
Denver-based manufacturing and minerals maker, has agreed to pump
up to $520 million into the trust over seven years.

<HEAD>Unprecedented Strike Halts Stock Trading In Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERO VALSECCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented four-day strike by floor
traders is paralyzing Italian stock markets, dashing a trading
volume of hundreds of millions of dollars daily and possibly
scaring off foreign investors.
   The National Association of Bourse Floor Traders says its 1,000
members' chief gripe is government inaction on long-awaited
regulatory reforms intended to make the markets more competitive
internationally.
   The reforms would regulate public tender offers, insider trading
and financial intermediaries.
   Another change, merging floor traders with security
intermediaries, including brokers, commission dealers and banks,
would be aimed at making stock trading smoother and upgrading the
Italian bourse.
   The floor traders also are protesting the increased paperwork
associated with a proposed 30 percent tax on capital gains.
   Rino Formica, the Socialist finance minister, called the
blockade of stock operations a ``revolt'' against the proposed tax.
   The traders reject the claim that they are upset over the tax.
   ``The idea of a tax on capital gains has been long digested by
Italian markets. We are protesting slowness in implementing reform,
which is hurting the competitiveness of Italian markets and
prompting investors to flee,'' said a member of the Milan-based
Association, who spoke on condition of anonimity.
   Italy's stock business is confined to about 200 brokers. It is
considered a relatively weak market in Europe because of the
limited number of listed companies, 220, and because there isn't a
law against insider trading.
   The association is increasingly worried that London's SEAQ
trading circuit could siphon a significant amount of business from
Italian exchanges.
   Some analysts predict that up to 40 percent of the trading in
Italian stocks would be done in London unless the Italian
parliament passes reform laws.
   Several Italian blue chip companies, such as Fiat, Generali,
Olivetti, Pirelli, Montedison and Sip, are traded in London and
have been quoting prices during the strike in Italy.
   The strike, initiated Friday, is scheduled to last through
Wednesday when a delegation of traders and the government are set
to meet in Rome to discuss the case.
   In the meantime, picket lines outside the two largest Italian
markets in Milan and Rome prevented trading in equities and bonds.
   Only foreign exchange quotations by bank officials were
completed.
   Although several floor dealers emphasized that they were seeking
protection for their jobs, the labor action did not get full
support from leftist trade unions.
   L'Unita, the organ of the Italian Communist party, called the
stock market strike ``a protest by the rich against a most sacred
tax.''
   Albert Alonzo, an Italy analyst with Barclays De Zoete Wedd of
London, noted that ``to close the market down does not endear the
market to foreign investors.''
   The blockade in fact comes at a difficult time for Italian
financial markets, already in deep malaise following a drop in
trading volume and in prices, due in part to the Gulf crisis.
   The Milan stock market index fell about 25 percent from last
January to mid-November, while quotations of blue chips such as
Fiat and Olivetti hit the lowest levels in years.
   ``The worst problem, however, is the confusion about the capital
gains tax and about when reforms will be enforced,'' said a Milan
broker.

<HEAD>Vegas Resort Dramatic Financial Success First Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Mirage Hotel celebrates its first
anniversary as the premier showplace on the glitzy Strip this week
and chairman Steve Wynn says it has exceeded his heady forecast of
a year ago by ``miles and miles.''
   At a time when gaming competitors Donald Trump and Bally Corp.
are facing mounting financial woes, Wynn's Mirage is the talk of
the industry.
   ``We'll do 40 to 50 percent better than our best expectations,''
Wynn said in a weekend interview.
   Even prophets of doom in the financial community are backing off
dire predictions made a year ago when Wynn opened the $630 million,
3,100-room resort, which features a flaming volcano, white tigers
and bottlenose dolphins.
   Hotel revenues the first year will run between $600 million and
$650 million, Wynn said, his fingers sweeping across the latest
monthly balance sheet.
   Before his resort opened a year ago Thursday, Wynn was
forecasting cash flow of $130 million to $140 million. Gaming
analysts projected $110 million to $120 million.
   Now, Wynn says, that figure will be closer to $180 million to
$200 million.
   ``The amazing thing is that we keep expecting it to slow down
and it doesn't,'' Dan Lee, a gaming analyst with First Boston Inc.,
said Monday.
   ``Ordinarily the second year a casino is open is more profitable
than the first, but with the year they had, that will be hard to
top,'' Lee said.
   The success of the resort has prompted Wynn to borrow another
$100 million for upgrades at the property such as a $14 million,
1.5 million gallon home for five dolphins.
   The idea of $500 million-plus in debt doesn't bother Wynn.
   ``You've got a property here that's appraised at somewhere north
of a billion, probably $1.2 billion,'' Wynn said.
   Wynn estimates 25,000 to 45,000 people visit the Mirage daily,
surpassing Hoover Dam as the most popular attraction in Southern
Nevada. The estimates mean that 13 million of the 19 million people
who visited Las Vegas the past year stopped by. An estimated
750,000 people overwhelmed the resort on opening weekend a year
ago.
   Wynn's Mirage has had a domino effect on this gaming community,
which mesmerized him when he visited as a 10-year-old boy 38 years
ago.
   The Mirage has transformed the Strip and has sparked a
multibillion-dollar building boom of new hotels and massive
additions to existing properties. The hotel boom has spread to the
rest of the city's economy, making it one of the fastest-growing
cities in the country.
   Wynn's hotel and casino was the most expensive in the world
until Trump opened his $1.2 billion Taj Mahal earlier this year.
The Taj has been unable to meet its debt service and faces
financial reorganization.
   Wynn's parent Golden Nugget Corp. sold its Atlantic City
property to Bally in 1987 for $440 million.
   He thinks the sale was a smart one, as New Jersey gamers face
increasingly tough times.
   ``We saw the outcome of the Atlantic City process pretty much
the way it worked out,'' Wynn said. ``That's why we wanted to sell.
We became very concerned about the Atlantic City market in '86. We
thought it was going to run out of steam, that the regulatory
policies of state law were going to kill it. The politicians are
the ones who screwed it up.
   ``The failure is Atlantic City, not Donald Trump's ego,'' Wynn
said of problems at the Taj Mahal. ``They're all in trouble. It
isn't just the Taj, it's the town. The trouble is the guys there
have to overcome the city, whereas here, the city helps make the
hotel.
   ``The problem is much deeper than whether Donald Trump or
Bally's or anyone else is smarter. The guys who knew the town
haven't had a way to get out or they would have.
   ``He would have been much stronger if he'd left the Taj alone,''
Wynn said of Trump, who once called Wynn a ``classic
under-achiever.''

<HEAD>Greyhound Conditions Bankruptcy Filing on Suit by Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. has tied its bankruptcy
reorganization to a dispute with the National Labor Relations Board
over treatment of its striking drivers.
   In a Chapter 11 plan filed with a bankruptcy judge in Corpus
Christi Monday, Greyhound said it will restructure itself and issue
new stock, most of which will go to unsecured creditors.
   The plan must be approved by U.S. bankruptcy Judge Richard S.
Schmidt and Greyhound's creditors. Its completion also hinges on
how Schmidt views the NLRB's charges against Greyhound on behalf of
6,000 drivers who went on strike in March.
   The NLRB has charged Greyhound with unfair labor practices and
says the company owes the drivers more than $80 million in back pay
and damages, attorneys say. The filing says Greyhound will not
proceed with the reorganization if drivers win more than $40
million.
   The company earlier asked Schmidt to define any amount of money
the NLRB wins for strikingdrivers as an unsecured claim at the
bottom of Greyhound's list of obligations.
   ``If those two conditions are not met, we would not try to
confirm this plan we would pull it back and re-look at it,'' said
George W. Hanthorn, senior vice president and general counsel for
Greyhound.
   Attorneys for the drivers received copies of the plan late
Monday and had no immediate comment.
   Under the plan, all of Greyhound's routes will keep operating.
   ``I think really the key to the plan is the way our operations
have come back since the strike,'' Hanthorn said. ``Without those
improved and good operations, a plan like this we have proposed on
this fast a track couldn't happen.''
   Passenger revenue fell below half of 1989's monthly levels
during the first part of the strike, but steadily increased over
the summer and, in October, was 90 percent of the 1989 figure.
   The company would like to complete the reorganization process by
next spring or early summer, Hanthorn said.
   Greyhound filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code in early June, three months after the
drivers went on strike over wages and benefits. The expense of
fighting the strike and a fall in revenue after the strike siphoned
cash Greyhound needed to operate, the company said then.
   The plan shows Greyhound placing less emphasis on its charter
service. Its food subsidiary will be liquidated and travel service
subsidiary, which is assigned no value in the plan, will be
dissolved.
   Reducing its charter business, eliminating some routes and
consolidating others allowed Greyhound to hire substantially fewer
drivers to replace the members of the Amalgamated Transit Union who
struck the company.
   About 600 drivers crossed the picket line and the company hired
more than 3,000 other replacements.

<HEAD>Revised Counts Against Keating, 3 Others Will Be Challenged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers in the Lincoln Savings
securities fraud trial will challenge a revised indictment that
increases the number of criminal counts from 42 to 46 against
Charles Keating Jr. and three others.
   A grand jury handed up the original indictment, and only a grand
jury - not prosecutors - should be allowed to make major changes in
it, said Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Keating co-defendant Judy J.
Wischer.
   ``You can't add more counts without a grand jury voting on it,''
said Lowell.
   Prosecutors filed the revised charges Monday against Keating in
an attempt to salvage 22 of the original 42 counts. They had been
set aside by a judge who said they were too vague or failed to
state an offense supported by evidence in nearly 4,600 pages of
grand jury testimony.
   Among other things, the amended indictment provides more
specific examples of alleged wrongdoing by Keating and three top
executives of his companies in the sale of $200 million in
now-worthless junk bonds at Lincoln branches.
   Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman said the revised
charges correct flaws cited by Superior Court Judge Lance Ito on
Nov. 9, when Ito ordered the 22 counts dismissed.
   Defense attorneys are expected to challenge the new charges on
many grounds. The earliest Ito could rule on the matter is Dec. 3,
the next hearing date in the case.
   The charges Ito set aside involve 20 counts of selling
securities without government approval, one count of lying to
regulators and one count of advertising securities for sale without
filing copies of the ads three days in advance with the Department
of Corporations.
   However, the heart of the case is contained in 20 counts Ito let
stand. Those charges contend elderly investors were misled about
the safety of high-yield, high-risk bonds they purchased at Lincoln
branches.
   The junk bonds were issued by American Continental Corp. of
Phoenix, a development company owned by the Keating family.
American Continental in turn owned Irvine-based Lincoln.
   About $250 million in bonds, most of them sold at Lincoln
branches, became worthless on April 13, 1989, when American
Continental sought bankruptcy protection.
   Lincoln was seized the next day. Experts say its failure will
cost taxpayers $2 billion, the biggest S&amp;L bailout yet. In civil
suits including a $1 billion racketeering action, Keating is
accused of looting the thrift.

   A Chicago company is recalling more than five
tons of hot dogs suspected of being contaminated by food poisoning.
   Agriculture Department officials said on Monday that David Berg
&amp; Co. is recalling 10,000 pounds of bulk-packed ``David Berg Beef
Frankfurters'' distributed in California, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania and Texas.
   Also being recalled are about 1,400 pounds of retail-packaged
``David Berg Deli Beef Franks'' distributed in the Chicago
metropolitan area.
   The franks may be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, an
organism that can cause listeriosis, which was described as ``a
rare but potentially serious disease.'
   The bulk-packed hot dogs are sold in 10-pound boxes and are
distributed to hot dog vendors, delicatessens and restaurants.
``EST. 1'' appears inside the USDA inspection seal on the box
label. All bulk franks with the code 60250 on the bottom of the box
are being recalled.
   The 12-ounce retail packages were distributed to grocery stores
and supermarkets in Chicago. ``EST. 1'' appears in the inspection
seal on the package label. All retail packages with ``Sell by Dec.
10'' stamped on the side of the package are being recalled.
   None of the company's other products are involved in the recall,
said Ronald J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service.

   Stock prices fell today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, while the dollar closed nearly unchanged against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
346.53 points Monday, declined 312.68 points, or 1.33 percent,
closing at 23,205.48.
   A total of only 210 million shares were traded on the first
section, down from 300 million shares Monday.
   Iraq's announcement that it was increasing its forces in Kuwait
dampened investors' buying interest, said Masahiko Fujita, an
analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   ``As shown in the day's trading volume, most market players,
including institutional investors, took a wait-and-see position,''
he said.
   The dollar closed at 128.93 yen, down 0.02 yen from Monday's
close of 128.95 yen. It opened at 129.23 yen and ranged between
128.90 yen and 129.28 yen.
   Some $6.14 billion changed hands in spot currency trading, down
from $8.48 billion traded Monday.
   ``It's a quiet market,'' said Masaya Ueno, a dealer with Fuji
Bank.
   Ueno said the market still generally anticipated a lower dollar,
although its direction has yet to be clearly determined.
   He and other dealers said the dollar rose in early trading after
news reports that Iraq would add about 250,000 troops to the
430,000 in Kuwait and southern Iraq, but later slipped lower.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 85.34 points, from Monday's close
of 85.32. Their yield fell to 7.635 percent from 7.640 percent.

   In 1989, UCAR had sales of $802 million, Mitsubishi said.
   Mitsubishi said the sale fits both its own
international-expansion strategy and Union Carbide's restructuring
plans.
   With the stake in UCAR Mitsubishi said it had broadened its own
supply of electrodes beyond Japanese sources.
   UCAR'S current management will continue to operate the company,
Mitsubishi said.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Spinoffs Set For Dec. 4</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Pacific Corp. has announced it will
split into three independent entities on Dec. 4. in a move it says
will benefit shareholders.
   The railroad, energy and real-estate conglomerate said Monday
that its board of directors approved a previously announced plan to
spin off Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus Development Corp.,
formerly Santa Fe Pacific Realty, to shareholders.
   Santa Fe stockholders of record as of Nov. 29 will receive a
special, tax-free dividend consisting of one share of common stock
of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 shares of Santa Fe
Pacific held, and one share of Catellus for every 4 shares of Santa
Fe Pacific. Distributions of fractional shares will be settled in
cash.
   The spinoffs will leave the Chicago-based parent company with
three interests: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Santa
Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and a 44 percent stake in Santa Fe
Pacific Pipelines.
   Santa Fe announced in April its plan to spin off the
Houston-based energy and San Francisco-based real-estate units as
part of a far-reaching restructuring program begun in 1987.
   Chairman Robert Krebs said in a statement that the values of
Santa Fe's diversified assets have not been reflected in Santa Fe's
stock price.
   Santa Fe Pacific stock closed 25 cents lower at $13 a share
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``Our stockholders should benefit from this separation because
it will place a spotlight on the values inherent in those
companies,'' he said.
   ``In addition, the directors, management and employees of all
three companies will now be able to focus their energies on better
utilizing and developing their assets,'' he said.
   Santa Fe previously sold 18.3 percent of Santa Fe Energy
Resources to the public. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Santa Fe also has sold a 20 percent stake in the real-estate
subsidiary to a limited partnership formed by JMB Realty Corp. and
the California Public Employees Retirement System. Santa Fe said
Catellus has been approved for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEAD>Popeyes Franchisees Sue Chain's Founder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit filed by a group of Popeyes Famous
Fried Chicken franchise owners in 20 states claims chain owner Al
Copeland violated state and federal antitrust laws by forcing
franchisees to purchase products from his companies.
   The suit filed Monday also alleges Copeland has transferred food
items and confidential company information to Church's Fried
Chicken, a larger competitor which Copeland bought last year.
   ``Quite simply, given the financial drain that Church's
represents, it has caused Popeyes to forget the people who made it
what it is today,'' said Brent Barriere, attorney for Independent
Popeyes Franchise Group.
   IPFG is made up of more than 50 people who own more than 200
Popeyes franchises in 20 states.
   Al Copeland Enterprises Inc. and a subsidiary called Diversified
Foods &amp; Seasonings Inc., which sells spices, beans, gravy, biscuit
base and other products to Popeyes franchises, are also named as
defendants in the 33-page suit.
   ``We do not have a statement. There is no response at this
time,'' said Copeland's spokeswoman, Kit Wohl of the publicity firm
Watts Wohl &amp; Associates Inc.
   She said there are nearly 800 Popeyes in 39 states and nearly
1,200 Church's restaurants in 24 states around the country. As of
June, she said, Al Copeland Enterprises owned 130 Popeyes and had
646 Popeyes franchises; it owned 752 Church's outlets and had
franchises with 444.
   The lawyer for the franchise group said, ``Popeyes, in part, at
least, because of its swallowing of Church's has failed to respond
to the interest of franchisees, has been distracted with promotions
... and ... has not given the type of support ... and advertising
that franchisors are required to give under the franchise
agreement.''
   The lawsuit said that IPFG's members never expected Popeyes to
change the fundamental nature of its system.
   ``In addition to the distraction caused by Church's ... we think
Popeyes is engaged in direct competition with Popeyes
franchisees,'' Barriere said. He said that Church's outlets within
Popeyes franchise areas guts the exclusivity which franchisees have
bargained and paid for.
   The suit asks for 15 specific orders, including ones to:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   - Make Copeland's get rid of its interest in any Church's
restaurant in the same market as an existing Popeyes franchise.
   - Keep Copeland's from adding to Church's menu items similar to
those on Popeyes restaurants.
   - Make Copeland's separate all marketing, training and
advertising workers for the two chains.
   - Make Copeland let franchises buy food and other products from
alternative suppliers and to make specifications for their
proprietary products available to those suppliers.

<HEAD>Boeing Mulls Cutbacks in Space Station Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co., a contractor on the space station,
has scrapped plans to expand its work force next year on the
project.
   Boeing is working with NASA on potential cutbacks in the project
required by congressional budget trimming.
   ``We expect growth on the space station program to remain
relatively flat for the next few years,'' Boeing spokeswoman Peri
Widener said Monday from Huntsville, Ala., where Boeing's space
station program is based.
   Widener said the company has dropped plans to increase its
1,000-member work force on the project by 10 percent to 15 percent
in 1991.
   The space station is designed to be constructed on Earth and
carried into space aboard roughly 20 shuttle flights.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. is the main contractor on the space
station.
   Boeing has a 10-year, $1.6 billion contract to build several key
elements of the space platform, including a 44-foot habitation
module for the eight-member permanent crew and a second module to
be used for experiments with commercial materials such as
electronics and medicinal drugs. Boeing will also build the
``nodes'' that will connect the modules.
   The entire platform is to be reassembled in space by shuttle
astronauts.
   Boeing had been counting on the space station to boost its
faltering military defense program. The company's Defense and Space
Group lost $474 million last year and anticipates additional heavy
losses for this year.
   But last month Congress ordered the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration to trim $6 billion out of the $37 billion
space station budget over the next six years. NASA was also ordered
to cut spending for the current fiscal year to $1.9 billion from a
budget proposal of $2.45 billion.
   NASA, which planned to spend up to $4 billion annually on the
project in coming years, was also given an annual spending cap of
$2.6 billion.
   NASA spokesman Mark Hess said the agency began a 90-day review
last week to come up with ways to slim down the original version of
the ambitious project. All contractors have been asked for their
suggestions, he said.
   Widener said Boeing has submitted a preliminary proposal to NASA
that suggests possible alterations that could help the program meet
its budget constraints. Widener declined to elaborate on the
proposal.

<HEAD>Bellcore Says It Has Time-Stamp To Protect Records, Settle Patent
Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bellcore researchers say an electronic
``notary public'' they developed can tighten electronic security
systems by proving when a document was created and whether it has
been altered.
   Customers could submit any type of document electronically for
time-stamping under the Bellcore time-stamping service, or the TSS.
   Computer experts said Monday that no electronic security system
is impenetrable, but they say if the TSS works as touted, it will
be the most secure system of its kind.
   ``With other computer security systems, you can't maintain the
level of security that they claim you can maintain here,'' said
Paul Zorfass, director of computer research at the Yankee Group in
Boston. ``It sounds like something that would have great appeal to
individuals who have a careful requirement for control.''
   As technology has advanced and more records have been
computerized, such security systems have become high-priority items
for businesses and researchers.
   ``If you have an important researcher, you have a situation
where a notary public stamps his notebook, say every two weeks,''
said Scott Stornetta, a research scientist at Bellcore who
developed the system along with Stuart Haber. ``What this is, is an
electronic notary public.''
   The system will be installed at Bellcore's headquarters in
Morris Township within the next six months for testing, he said.
The company has applied for a patent and will probably license the
product soon after the patent is granted, Stornetta said.
   Bellcore provides research and other technical support to the
companies of Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific
Telesis, Southwestern Bell Corp. and U.S. West.
   Costs have not been determined, but Stornetta said the
electronic security program would be within a range acceptable to
virtually anyone who needs such a device.
   In the case of an invention, a company could submit a
description of the product while still keeping the idea secret from
the TSS, Stornetta said.
   That would be done by sending only a small representation of the
original document to the time-stamping service. A mathematical
process called hashing would be used to create a ``digital
fingerprint'' that represents the entire data. Changing even one
character in the original text would change the digital
fingerprint, showing that the document had been altered.
   Bill Garvin, a product manager at Computer Associates in Garden
City, N.Y., said Bellcore appears to be improving an already
existing security system.
   Computer Associates, a leader in the electronic security field,
already has a system called CA-EXAMINE that can detect whether a
computer file or program has been altered. What it cannot do is
verify when a particular file originated.
   ``I can see it having use,'' Garvin said, ``but it doesn't sound
like something that would be a head-to-head competitor.''
   Bill Strapko, a senior consultant at International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass., said the Bellcore system will be watched closely
by the industry.
   ``For example, in the area of software, people are saying, `I
did this before they did,' and there are all kinds of problems like
that,'' Strapko said. ``The time-stamp sounds like it could prove
that they did develop something first.''
   He cautioned, however, that no electronic security system has
been developed that is foolproof.
   ``If somebody is sharp enough, they can probably go into this
system and beat it too,'' Strapko said. ``No matter what security
system you have, there is a backdoor into it, unfortunately.''

<HEAD>Federal Officials Say Higher Texas Oil Production No Longer Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher oil production in Texas is no longer needed
because world supplies currently exceed demand, Federal energy
officials have told the Texas Railroad Commission.
   The commission voted unanimously Monday not to renew an
emergency order allowing oil wells across most of Texas to pump at
maximum capacity.
   ``The Department of Energy did not think it was still a
necessity,'' said commission Chairman Kent Hance.
   The commission had approved the 90-day emergency order
increasing oil production in August at the request of the U.S.
Department of Energy. The agency said the additional oil was needed
to make up for losses resulting from the U.S. trade embargo against
Iraq.
   Although there was a fear that oil supplies would dwindle after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, several other nations - led by
Saudi Arabia - stepped up production to fill the loss.
   Now, Railroad Commissioner Jim Nugent said, there is an
``oversupply of oil in the world.''
   ``We don't want to be endangering any of our Texas reservoirs by
overproduction,'' Nugent said. ``If the nation is in danger and
there's a critical shortage, we're certainly willing to work with
producers and the federal government to up production, but not when
there isn't an urgent national need.''
   In a memo to the commission Friday, agency official Ronald
Schultz Jr. said the Energy Department had decided additional
production was no longer needed because oil supplies exceed world
demand by 100,000 barrels of oil per day and are expected to exceed
demand by 1 million barrels per day in March if a war does not
break out in the Persian Gulf.
   Commission spokesman Brian Schaible said officials had estimated
Texas could produce an additional 20,000 barrels of oil a day under
the emergency order, but he would not know for another month the
actual production in September.
   After Nov. 29, the wells will go back to their normal production
levels, Schaible said. The rate in August was 1.7 million barrels a
day.

<HEAD>Volkswagen to Make Cars in Northern China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The German automaker Volkswagen and a Chinese
factory signed a contract Tuesday to establish one of China's
largest automotive joint ventures.
   Construction will start next year on an $800 million auto plant
in the northeastern city of Changchun, with the capacity to build
150,000 Golf sedans each year, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
   Volkswagen already operates a joint venture in Shanghai that
produces Santana sedans. That facility can produce 60,000 cars
annually, but has been limited by the government to less than
20,000 because the cars are made basically from imported kits.
Parts are being localized gradually.
   Volkswagen's partner in the new venture is the No. 1 Motor
Vehicle Plant of Changchun, which has been making Audis under a
licensing agreement. Xinhua did not say what proportion of imported
and locally made parts would go into the new Golfs.
   It said Volkswagen had agreed to transfer to the joint venture
all the manufacturing technology needed to make Golfs. In addition,
the German corporation will buy engines and spare parts from the
joint venture.
   Volkswagen will be responsible for selling 15 percent of the
cars on the international market, Xinhua said, a potentially
difficult target. China has always pressed its joint ventures to
export, but the technology of Chinese-made cars is too outdated and
prices are too high to compete on world markets.
   Volkswagen's Shanghai-made Santanas are sold in China for about
$27,000.
   China's No. 2 Automobile Works recently formed a joint venture
with the French carmaker Citroen that also is expected to produce
150,000 cars annually by the year 2000.
   France's Peugot, U.S.-based Chrysler and Japan's Isuzu already
operate joint-venture car plants in China, and domestically made
cars have begun to outnumber imports on Beijing streets.

   Shares in the advertising giant WPP Group PLC
dropped today for the second consecutive session following the
company's announcement that its profit would be ``somewhat below''
market forecasts.
   Shares of WPP, which owns the ad agencies J. Walter Thompson and
Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, finished at 115 pence, or $2.27, a share
on London's Stock Exchange, down from Monday's close of 279 pence,
or $5.50, a share.
   Today's decline follows a drop of 99.5 pence, or 26 percent, on
Monday, when the company announced that its 1990 pre-tax profit
wouldn't match the market forecasts of 110 million pounds, or $217
million, because of a ``general economic downturn.''
   Clients spend less on advertising during a slowing economy.
   The company's pre-tax profit, the preferred indicator of profit
performance in Britain, came to 75 million pounds, or $122.4
million, in 1989.
   It had after-tax profit of 40.5 million pounds, or $66.1
million, on revenues of 4.4 billion pounds, or $7.19 billion, last
year.
   After the anouncement, analysts cut their pre-tax profit
estimates to anywhere between 65 million pounds and 90 million
pounds.

<HEAD>CBS Plans 20 Percent Cut in Payments to TV Affiliates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. today announced plans to cut payments
to television network affiliates for carrying its programs by 20
percent next year in a move that will save the media company about
$30 million.
   The announcement comes a day after CBS announced that it expects
to post a loss in the fourth quarter and lower earnings next year.
   It cited the deteriorating national advertising climate and the
costs of entertainment and sports programs for its financial
forecast.
   CBS executives met privately on Monday with representatives of
the 208 TV stations that are affiliated with the CBS Television
Newtork to discuss the proposed compensation reductions.
   CBS paid its affiliates $153 million this year in compensation.
The company said that was more than either major network
competitor, NBC or ABC, paid their affiliates. CBS estimated NBC
pays $132 million a year to its affiliates while ABC pays an
estimated $110 million.
   As part of its latest budgetary reviews, CBS said steps were
taken to control costs in every area of the company, including
affilate compensation.
   CBS said that in an effort to reduce the impact of the
compensation cuts, it was planning to give the local stations more
commercial time in news and sports programming to sell to local
advertisers. In addition, CBS said it would increase local
commercial time on broadcasts of the 1992 Winter Olympics.
   ``We have a mutual stake in each other's financial health and
viability,'' said Tony Malara, president of CBS Affliate Relations.
``Given our improved programming performance, we need to insure
that our financial picture will be sufficient to continue to
support it.''
   Spokesman George Schweitzer said the 20 percent compensation cut
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 was an across-the-board for all
affiliates.
   Some stations, particularly smaller ones, rely more heavily than
others on the payments and are expected to resist it.
   A call was placed to Berry Smith, head of the CBS Affiliate
Advisory Board and an executive at Schurz Communications Inc. in
South Bend, Ind., for reaction to the CBS plan but he was said to
be traveling.

   Gulf Air, owned by the Persian Gulf nations of
Bahrain, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Oman, has ordered 12 767-300
extended-range jetliners, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said
Tuesday.
   The order is worth $1.15 billion, Boeing said. Three of the
airplanes will be delivered within a few weeks, Boeing spokesman
Steve Smith said.
   Gulf Air already operates six 767-ERs, the largest 767 fleet in
the Middle East.
   It will use the new airplanes to extend service, including new
flights to Singapore and Sydney.
   The 767 is a twin-engine, wide-body aircraft. The Gulf Air
planes will seat 212 passengers in three classes. They will be
powered by engines from General Electric Co.
   Boeing said 44 customers have ordered 516 767s so far.
   For the year Boeing has sold 497 planes, worth a total of $44
billion.

   The stock market was down in lackluster trading
this afternoon, halting a rally that had begun last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 18.57 points at
2,546.78 as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5, with 510 up, 926
down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 115.69 million shares with two
hours left to trade.
   Analysts were puzzled to see the stock market falling at the
same time oil prices were moving down and bonds were higher. Some
traders might be taking things easy with two days to go until
Thanksgiving, while others might be selling stocks for
end-of-the-year tax purposes, analysts said.
   ``I think it's kind of consolidating its recent gains,'' said
Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``It has no new
strong stimulus here. I think people are going to make this a long
holiday.''
   Among actively traded issues, Boeing Co. was down 4&lsqb; at 43&lsqb;,
after being downgraded by Goldman Sachs. In other aircraft stocks,
McDonnell Douglas Corp. fell 1 to 50{, United Technologies was down
&rsqb; at 45\, Lockheed was down &lsqb; at 30} and Northrup was down &lsqb; at

<HEAD>Topps Hoping '91 Promotion Is Home Run For Baseball Card Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Did your mother throw away all your baseball
cards? Would you like to get some of them back?
   You may get the chance next year. Topps Chewing Gum Inc. is
celebrating the 40th anniversary of its first card by giving away
300,000 vintage cards - including the 1952 Mickey Mantle worth
$8,000 - with its regular 1991 packs that sell for 50 cents.
   The promotion is a marketing coup for the leader in the sports
card business, at a time when the competition has never been so
hot. Half a dozen companies are after a share of the
multimillion-dollar industry, which no longer caters just to kids,
but adult investors reliving those days when they bought cards to
flip on the playground or stick in the spokes of their bicycles.
   ``It's ferocious - fierce,'' said Ed Deke, a part-time collector
who runs a sports card show in Fairfield, Conn. ``A lot of people
have gotten into it.''
   Baseball cards still make up 80 percent to 90 percent of the
business. But some of the companies have expanded to - or deal
exclusively in - football, basketball and hockey cards, as well as
non-sport cards featuring heroes real and imaginary.
   The industry is so lucrative that the NBA has its own line of
cards this season. Pro Set Inc., Dallas maker of football and
hockey cards, will add a line of golf cards in mid-December. Upper
Deck Co. is adding hockey cards.
   Next year's baseball cards from Score of Westport, Conn., will
feature 13 ``Dream Team'' players in various stages of dress, from
a bare-chested Jose Canseco to Will Clark in a double-breasted
suit.
   And more companies are expanding into non-sport products, like
Pro Set's Music Superstar cards and Upper Deck's Comic Ball cards -
Looney Tunes characters in baseball garb.
   Topps makes cards with Batman, the Simpsons and Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.
   Among other competitors in the card business are Fleer Corp. of
Philadelphia, Donruss - a division of the Bannockburn, Ill.,
candymaker Leaf, Inc. - and the Canadian firm, O-Pee-Chee.
   Opinions are split on whether all these companies can survive,
with the glut of products on the shelf. While analysts think the
industry will thrive in the 1990s, the same may not be true for
individual companies.
   ``The me-toos, the ones that don't really have a strong
franchise and a very big base of customers, are going to find it
extremely difficult to exist,'' said Stanley Lanzet, an analyst
with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Inc. in New York.
   Topps egan in 1951 with a deck of baseball cards that could be
used to play a game. It made its first individual cards in 1952,
such as the Mantle card, the Roy Campanella card worth $1,300 and
the Eddie Matthews card worth $1,750.
   Fleer and Donruss entered the scene in 1981; Upper Deck joined
in 1989. But Topps is still the big kid on the block, with $246
million in revenue in its latest fiscal year, up from $198 million
the year before.
   The other companies are private except Fleer, which went public
in June and reported $119 million in sales in the first nine months
of 1990.
   Topps' customers could make some bucks of their own with next
year's promotion, which will give away one of every Topps card ever
made with the 1991 packs.
   Most of the cards will go directly into the 1991 packs, although
the company will insert redemption certificates for the more
valuable cards, like the 1952 Mantle, the 1953 Willy Mays worth
$1,600, the 1954 Ted Williams worth $2,800 and the 1955 Roberto
Clemente worth $1,050.
   Even a common player card from 1967 is worth up to $16.
   Topps will also give away one complete set from 1952.
   Spokesman Ken Liss said the company approached collectors for
some of the giveaway cards, but found quite a few collecting dust
around its Brooklyn, N.Y., headquarters.
   ``I think it's a great promotion,'' said Richard O. Rieger, an
analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. Inc. ``It's like they found
old cards in a warehouse and held an auction.''
   In addition to special promotions, Topps is using television
advertising to hype its cards, as is Upper Deck.
   Upper Deck also is leasing space on the boards at three NHL
arenas and using players like Wayne Gretzky to hawk its upscale
cards, which cost twice as much as Topps' and are printed with an
anti-counterfeiting hologram.
   ``We have our niche in the marketplace,'' said Jay McCracken,
Upper Deck vice president of sales. ``We've seen a lot of the
competition come at us this year with new ideas, and that means
we'll just have to work that much harder.''
   That may be the companies' key to success. Sports cards are
cheap enough to make the industry more or less recession-proof - a
pack of 15 Topps cards costs 50 cents - and the number of hobbyists
is growing. But analysts still question whether there's room for
all the products.
   ``We do hear stories the product isn't selling through as fast
as a year ago - not necessarily our stuff, but the product in
general. And there's a tremendous proliferation of (card) shows
these days. I think yesterday we had four within 20 miles in this
area.,'' McCracken said from Upper Deck headquarters in Yorba
Linda, Calif.
   ``When you spread yourself so thin, obviously not everyone is
going to do well. There are so many products and so many dealers.
But we are still seeing a lot of people come into the hobby,'' he
said.

<HEAD>From Ice Cream To Smoked Quail, Mail-Order Food Market Revs Up For
Holidays</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   'Tis the season for mail-order giving, and more of the gifts
criss-crossing the nation make for a transportable feast.
   Fruit in the mail is nothing new, but how about six pints of
assorted gelato packed in dry ice? It's yours if someone doesn't
mind paying $10 a pint to get it to you.
   And forget the mundane fruitcake. Select instead a bouquet of
porcini mushrooms, a pair of smoked quail or a basket of prickly
pears.
   The 3,600 companies that tempt the palate with mail-order
edibles are competing for $1.2 billion that Americans are expected
to spend on food orders this year, according to a recent study by
the New York market research firm FINDSVP.
   Growing at an annual rate of about 10 percent, mail-order foods
are likely to account for more than $3 billion in sales by the year
2000, FINDSVP said.
   Business whips into a frenzy during the final quarter, with some
mail-order companies doing virtually all of their shipping between
September and January. Entire 747 jets have been stuffed with
nothing but thousands of pounds of holiday pears from Harry and
David.
   Based in Medford, Ore., Harry and David has sales in excess of
$120 million, making it perhaps the largest mail-order food company
in the nation. According to FINDSVP, the top 10 food-by-mail
companies control 45 percent of the market; about 3,000 companies
are characterized as ``mom-and-pop'' operations, each with sales of
less than $50,000 a year.
   Though the vast majority of food moves by ground transportation,
most of the industry's growth is in overnight and two-day delivery
services, which can guarantee a delicate or perishable item arrives
intact.
   Clambake Celebrations of Cape Cod, Mass., for example, can
promise a customer in Albuquerque, N.M., that she will have
lobster, mussels, a few ears of corn - all packed in authentic
seaweed - steaming on the stove less than 48 hours after phoning in
the order. The cost: $119.95 for two.
   San Francisco's Gelato Classico Italian Ice Cream is just
begining to offer its products by mail. Six pints - which comprise
a minimum order at $59.95 - are packaged in dry ice in a foam
container much like a picnic cooler.
   Consultant Jay Walker, who heads Ridgefield, Conn.-based Catalog
Media Corp., said that though food-by-mail has been big business
for a long time, ``overnight delivery ... allowed a freshness
perception for millions of people who didn't believe they could get
(food) fresh in the mail. And it made sure food can be given as a
gift reliably.''
   If you ask Federal Express, spokesman Brandon Davis will tell
you his company has been a major boost to the food industry. ``Our
business ... allows them to extend their business season right up
to Dec. 21,'' he said. ``If you do 80 percent of your business in
one or two months of the year and can extend that selling season by
just two weeks, it's a tremendous boost.''
   Companies with very narrow product lines can stay in business
because they cater to a national - rather than local - clientele.
Franklin Foods of North Franklin, Conn., for example, sells only
exotic mushrooms like Polish cepes, shiitakes and porcinis.
Smithfield, Va.-based Fin 'N Feather will put a smoked pheasant
buffet on your table.
   Mr. Spear Inc. of Stockton, Calif., has cultivated a list of
25,000 fans of its colossal asparagus, its sole product. ``It's an
alternative to flowers,'' said president Chip Arnett. His
super-premium asparagus, which has been served at the White House,
simply is ``not in sufficient enough quantities to make it
available from a retail standpoint,'' he said.
   Consultant Walker believes the food-by-mail business is
``countercyclical'' to the economy - that is, as the recession
deepens, business is likely to increase.
   Consumers who feel pinched for cash typically ``trade down''
when it comes to buying gifts, and food is a popular alternative
because it has ``no comparative market price,'' Walker said. ``You
don't know if a dozen apples from an orchard in Oregon is a $20
gift or a $40 gift,'' he said.
   Perusing catalogs in the coziness of one's own home and ordering
with the mere push of telephone buttons has become a recreational
pasttime of sorts for many Americans.
   ``People are sitting home and they're bored and so they pick up
the phone and buy on a credit card,'' said Debbie Cohen, a national
saleswoman for Melissa's World Variety Produce Inc., a Los Angeles
company that specializes in shipping in exotic produce like purple
potatoes, elephant garlic and prickly pears.
   Though consumers who buy foods through the mail make up less
than 2 percent of the population, they are an affluent lot willing
to pay more for convenience and a guarantee of quality.
   A pint of Gelato Classico costs just $3.95 in one of the
company's 32 shops, but the minimum 6-pint mail order commands a
$36 shipping charge. Too extravagant to buy for yourself, perhaps,
but an exquisite gift to give.
   The mail-order business does have its limitations. Identifying
customers can be costly, and it is difficult to adapt quickly to
changes in consumer taste. A company that must put together its
Christmas catalog by August can't suddenly decide to replace its
pecan pie if cranberries become the rage.
   In addition, the threat of higher postal rates always looms
large. Third-class postage, the rate for most catalogs, has
increased more than 350 percent since 1970, and the U.S. Postal
Service is planning another rate hike for February.
   Mail-order companies are being pressed to collect sales taxes on
a higher proportion of their sales, forcing them to compete harder
against local retailers.
   Finally, since the food business is seasonal, some companies
actually are forced to shut down during spring and summer. Others
try to round out their offerings with other products. Harry and
David, for example, has a sister company called Jackson and
Perkins, a gardening and flower concern, which helps smooth out
sales throughout the year.
   To further entice customers, many companies have a
``thing-of-the-month'' plan. For $219.95, Harry and David will send
a box of fruit once a month; for $720, Gelato will send six pints
of its super-premium ice cream 12 times a year, and you get to
choose among flavors like fresh ginger, double espresso and Coppa
Mista, with swirls of chocolate, vanilla, pistachio and almond ice
creams.
   Among other ``special'' services companies provide, Baskets of
Elegance, a California fashioner of gourmet food baskets, sends
customers a color photograph of their orders before they're
shipped.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Reports Lower Earnings In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Corp. reported Tuesday its
earnings fell 9.4 percent in the third quarter, partly because of
costs associated with its acquisition of Marshall Field &amp; Co.
   The retailer said its earnings in the quarter ended Nov. 3
declined to $58 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $64
million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 16 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.24 billion.
   The company said its earnings were affected by costs resulting
from its employee stock ownerhip plan and the $1.04 billion
acquisition of Marshall Field from BAT Industries PLC.
   Dayton Hudson said its operating profit, which does not take
into account one-time transactions like the ESOP or acquisitions,
was up 12 percent.
   The company fared somewhat better than other retailers whose
profits were down because of sluggish consumer spending. However,
profits at its department store division rose only because of an
accounting change connected with the Marshall Field transaction.
   Department stores have been among those hit the hardest as
consumers cut back their spending in response to the faltering
economy and the Middle East crisis.
   Besides Marshall Field and Dayton's and Hudson's department
stores, the company owns Mervyn's stores and Target discount
stores.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Dayton Hudson said
it earned $181 million, or $2.28 per share, up from $160 million,
or $2.06 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue increased to $9.87 billion from $9.16 billion.
   Dayton Hudson also announced its capital spending for 1991 is
expected to total about $1 billion. The firm plans to open 46
Target stores, 15 to 20 Mervyn's stores and two department stores.
   Dayton Hudson operates 708 stores in 33 states.

<TEXT>
   U S West Inc. has pulled out of a
consortium set up to supply Hong Kong with cable television after a
competitor won the right to build a satellite broadcast system in
that city, officials said.
   The pullout, announced Monday, will not have a significant
financial impact on the regional telephone company, U S West
spokesman Ed Mattix said from the company's headquarters in this
Denver suburb.
   U S West had a 25 percent interest in what was billed at the
world's largest cable TV franchise, which also included Hong
Kong-based Wharf Holdings and other partners. It would have cost
about $700 million to build the system, U S West said.
   Last summer, a group led by billionaire Hong Kong entrepreneur
Li Ka-shing won the right to construct a satellite broadcast system
that would link Hong Kong's apartment buildings and bypass any
cable system.
   The cable venture was one of several international moves by U S
West in recent years. It has won a contract to build the Soviet
Union's first cellular telephone system and has joined with Bell
Atlantic Corp. to build a cellular system in Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>WPP Shares Drop More Than 70 Percent After Gloomy Earnings
Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares in the world's biggest advertising and
marketing conglomerate, WPP Group PLC, tumbled again on Tuesday,
stretching their losses over two days to more than 70 percent in
the wake of a glum earnings forecast.
   The owner of the J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather ad
agencies announced on Monday that its 1990 profit wouldn't match
analysts' expectations.
   The announcement raised concerns about the company's ability to
meet its debt payments next year, analysts said Tuesday.
   WPP's shares closed Tuesday at 115 pence, or $2.27, a share on
London's Stock Exchange, down 164 pence, or 59 percent, from
Monday's close.
   The shares dropped 113 pence, or $2.23, a share on Monday. They
traded as high as 715 pence, or $14.09, a share in the past year.
   London-based WPP had no comment on the slide in its stock price,
said a company spokeswoman, who declined to be identified.
   The speed of the fall indicated that ``people are worried that
it's going to go bust,'' said David Grimbley, an advertising agency
analyst with the London investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
   Analysts said the market was shaken partly because WPP Chief
Executive Martin Sorrell, who has a reputation for being an adept
financial officer, had appeared to have created a company
invulnerable to the recession that has gripped the advertising
industries in the United States and Britain.
   Sorrell was the top financial officer in the British advertising
company Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, which grew to become the world's
largest ad and marketing services company in the mid-1980s through
acquisitions.
   He was credited for perfecting the buyout technique that enabled
the buyers to keep existing management on the job by making a
partial payment initially and tying addititional payments to
earnings performance over several years.
   Sorrell left the Saatchis and shook up Madison Avenue with the
first hostile takeover of an ad agency with his acquisition of J.
Walter Thompson's parent company in 1987. He acquired Ogilvy &amp;
Mather two years later.
   The Saatchis meanwhile stumbled because of their iversification
into the consulting business, and have forced to put them up for
sale.
   With $16.1 billion in worldwide billings in 1989, WPP surpassed
Saatchi and Saatchi PLC as the biggest advertising company,
according to the trade publication Advertising Age. Saatchi's
billings of $15.7 billion ranked it second, the publication said.
   WPP announced Monday that its pre-tax profit for the year
wouldn't match the analysts' forecast of 110 million pounds, or
$217 million, because of a ``general economic downturn,'' although
results for the normally strong final two months of the year
weren't in yet.
   The extent of the downturn in its businesses ``has only become
apparent this month,'' it said.
   The company posted a 77 percent increase in pre-tax profit in
the first six months of this year, and said at that time that its
spread of business interests should insulate it from the worldwide
economic downturn.
   WPP said in its statement that it continues to attract new
business, and expects to operate ``successfully at significant
levels of profitability.''
   Mark Shepperd, an analyst with UBS Phillips and Drew, said
Sorrell ``has been saying that `we won't be affected by the
downturn.' That now has proved not to be the case.''
   The London market in recent months has been nervous about stocks
of heavily indebted companies, which has made trading unusually
volatile.
   Analysts say WPP's debt amounts to some 320 million pounds, or
$630 million.
   Grimbley said, ``There are extreme worries that the company next
year might break its banking covenant.''
   WPP's agreement with lenders stipulates that the company's
operating profit should be 2{ times the level of interest it must
pay the banks, Grimbley said.
   ``Profit forecasts imply that that won't be the case,'' Grimbley
said.
   The company is unlikely to generate enough cash to pay off about
34 million pounds of long-term debt, as scheduled next year, partly
because it is required to pay dividends to its preferred
shareholders, Grimbley said.
   That means WPP might need short-term loans to pay off long-term
debt, and ``in current conditions banks are not that willing to
extend credit lines,'' Grimbley said.
   WPP's pre-tax profit, the preferred indicator of profit
performance in Britain, came to 75 million pounds in 1989.
   It had after-tax profit of 40.5 million pounds on revenues of
4.4 billion pounds last year.

   Analysts were puzzled to see the stock market falling at the
same time oil prices were moving down and bonds were higher. Some
traders might be taking things easy with two days to go until
Thanksgiving, while others might be selling stocks for
end-of-the-year tax purposes, analysts said.
   ``I think it's kind of consolidating its recent gains,'' said
Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``It has no new

<TEXT>
   Mana Saeed Otaiba, one of
the longest serving oil ministers in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, was replaced Tuesday in a cabinet reshuffle in
the United Arab Emirates.
   Otaiba was replaced as minister of petroleum and mineral wealth
with the little known Yousef bin Omeir bin Yousef.
   Other changes among the 24-member cabinet involve a new deputy
premier and new ministers in charge of foreign affairs, the
interior, the economy and commerce, labor and social affairs,
information, education and justice.
   Otaiba was the longest serving OPEC minister after Ahmed Zaki
Yamani of Saudi Arabia, who served for a quarter of a century
before he was removed in 1986.
   Otaiba, a poet born in 1946, first attended OPEC meetings as
representative of the Abu Dhabi emirate from 1969 to 1971. In 1971,
Abu Dhabi, Dubai and five other emirates united in the U.A.E. and
Otaiba was selected as the first federal oil minister.
   The oil minister's poetry expressed an outspoken stand on the
politics of the oil market through verse.
   Otaiba repeatedly walked out of OPEC meetings in protest against
what he usually described as unfair stands against his oil-rich
country.
   Sources said his replacement is an American-educated national
who is a senior official at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority,
ADIA, and a board member in the Abu Dhabi Insurance Co.
   Yousef is the son of a leading U.A.E. businessman, said the
sources, who refused to be named.
   Abu Dhabi is the leading oil producer in the U.A.E., which now
produces 2.3 million barrels per day.

<HEAD>Veterans Win $14 Million Judgment Against Insurance Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Superior Court jury, finding fraud and bad
faith, ordered an Ohio life insurance company to pay $14.38 million
to 1,800 servicemen and veterans.
   The class-action suit was brought against Nationwide Life
Insurance Co. of Columbus, Ohio, and its San Diego-based agent, the
non-profit Armed Forces Benefit &amp; Aid Association. Policyholders
from nearly every state sued when the life insurance provider
arbitrarily reduced benefits and eliminated coverage at age 60.
   In returning the verdict Monday, the jury ordered Nationwide and
its San Diego branch to pay $11.78 million in general damages and
$2.6 million in punitive damages.
   Lou Fabro, a Nationwide spokesman, said Tuesday that company
officers had no immediate comment on the verdict.
   ``We will be having a meeting next week to consider the verdict
and our options,'' he said. ``It's very probable that we will file
an appeal.''
   Jurors found the company violated its contract with servicemen
and veterans when it abruptly decided in 1975 to eliminate coverage
when policyholders reached their 60th birthday.
   Only upon turning 60, however, did the policyholders learn of
the change, said David Patterson, a Pittsburgh-based attorney who
representedseveral of the plaintiffs.
   Many had been paying $9.90 a month in premiums for years,
expecting lifelong coverage, he said. Instead, they were left late
in life with no benefits and had to face the difficult task of
trying to obtain new policies at affordable rates, Patterson said.
   Nationwide also in 1975 decided to reduce the benefits it paid
on the policy from $10,000 to as low as $2,000. Again, there was no
notification of the change to policyholders, Patterson said.
   In addition, the suit alleged that Nationwide's San Diego branch
falsely promoted itself as an armed services affiliated vendor,
persuading many who purchased a policy beginning in the 1960s that
the contract was backed by the government when it was not,
Patterson said.
   The suit was filed in 1988 in San Diego, where a sizable number
of the policies were sold.
   The jury deliberated just over two days before finding the
insurance company had violated laws against fraudulent
misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment of facts, bad-faith
insurance practices and conspiracy.

   An engineer serving on an Environmental
Protection Agency panel on smoking said Tuesday he is near
agreement with the Philip Morris tobacco company on a $1 million
research grant.
   James E. Woods Jr., of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University in Blacksburg, Va., is a member of an EPA panel
reviewing an agency report that concludes that second-hand
cigarette smoke causes lung cancer.
   The panel will meet in Washington, D.C., in December to consider
the merits of the report.
   Woods, a mechanical engineer, said negotiations on the grant
began six or eight months ago and that he submitted a proposal for
the money about one month ago. He earlier had said Philip Morris
had offered him the $1 million a month ago.
   Steven Parrish, a Philip Morris spokesman, said no offer had
been made. Told of Parrish's comment, Woods then said he was wrong
about the offer.
   The grant provides for construction of an office-like test
chamber to investigate ventilation effectiveness, Woods said.
   Woods said he expects to reach final agreement with Philip
Morris on the grant in about two months.
   Robert Flaak, an administrator with EPA's scientific advisory
board, said the grant would not conflict with Woods' advisory role
at the EPA.
   ``As long as it's in public knowledge, it does not constitute a
conflict of interest,'' Flaak said. The existence of the grant has
not been officially disclosed. Flaak said it will be disclosed at
the EPA panel's December meeting.
   ``There's always a chance for perceived conflict of interest,''
Flaak said. ``But is this a conflict with regard to the panel? No,
I don't think so. Is Dr. Woods going to represent himself fairly on
the panel? Sure, he will.''
   An anti-smoking group was sharply critical of the arrangement.
   ``It means that while he's sitting on the scientific advisory
board reviewing what the EPA has come up with, he's got this carrot
dangling in front of him which could affect his judgment,'' said
Julia Carol, associate director of Americans for Nonsmokers'
Rights, based in Berkeley, Calif.
   Woods said he was trying to set up the grant in such a way that
it would not affect his objectivity on the smoking issue. ``For 15
years, I've been on record saying that the best way to control
smoking in public buildings is to eliminate the smoker,'' he said.
``But there are situations where that can't happen.''
   He said the project would be conducted in the open, a university
committee would review the findings for scientific objectivity, and
the results would be publicly available.
   ``We feel at the university we can do open research on this even
though it's been funded by Philip Morris,'' Woods said.
   Flaak said Woods had expressed some concern about the grant.
``When I spoke with him at first about this, he was uncomfortable
about the situation,'' Flaak said. ``He's unhappy that he's going
to be getting research funds and having this looked at as a
conflict, which it isn't. I said I didn't think it was a problem.''
   Woods said his university is now considering whether to accept
the grant. ``We're working with the university right now to see
whether that's consistent with university policy,'' he said.
   Robert Axelrad, head of the EPA's indoor air division, which
prepared the passive-smoking report on lung cancer, gave Woods a
ringing endorsement.
   ``I'm not concerned about Jim Woods's objectivity. He's one of
the leaders in indoor air pollution and we know him to be an honest
and credible researcher,'' Axelrad said.
   Woods said the comments he intends to make on the EPA report
will demonstrate that he is not biased toward tobacco companies.
``Wait and see what I say at the hearing,'' he said, referring to
the panel's December meeting.
   The EPA passive-smoking panel has come under attack by
anti-smoking groups who have charged that it is biased toward the
tobacco industry. Six of its 16 members have ties to the Center for
Indoor Air Research, which is largely financed and run by the
tobacco industry.
   EPA officials said their lawyers have assured them that panel
members' ties with the tobacco-industry research center do not
constitute a conflict of interest.
   The executive director of the center, Max Eisenberg, agreed.
``Their association with the center isn't relevant,'' he said.
``What's important is they're the best people we can find.''
   Eisenberg said researchers from the EPA and the Centers for
Disease Control are also affiliated with the center.

<HEAD>Judge Appoints AFL-CIO Lawyer To Review Overhaul Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday appointed the AFL-CIO's
top lawyer to review a plan to overhaul the Manville trust designed
to speed compensation to workers poisoned by asbestos.
   U.S. District Judge Jack. B. Weinstein also called for
establishing a panel of labor, management and others to recommend
ways to devise a single, national fund to distribute all asbestos
settlements.
   In a letter to AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, Weinstein said
there was a need ``to stop the hemorrhaging of available assets and
to substitute a structured compensation system designed to benefit
claimants and companies alike.''
   Weinstein appointed Washington lawyer Laurence Gold, general
counsel of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
Organizations, to review the plan.
   Gold, 53, has been with the AFL-CIO since 1975. Weinstein asked
Kirkland to recommend an independent adviser who was ``uninfluenced
by the hope of high legal fees for participation.''
   In his letter, dated Monday, Weinstein said organized labor
should help solve the asbestos crisis because delays in providing
compensation ``undercut the ability of thousands of American
workers to secure needed financial assistance.''
   The judge also called on labor to help find a way to consolidate
the billions of dollars available from dozens of financially ailing
companies in bankruptcy court and other courts to compensate
asbestos victims.
   Weinstein has led an effort to reform asbestos litigation, which
clogs federal and state court dockets. According to some estimates,
up to 70 percent of money intended for victims has gone to lawyers
and others. Cases can take years to resolve.
   Tens of thousands of workers suffer from lung cancer and other
respiratory diseases caused by breathing asbestos fibers on the
job. More than 90,000 lawsuits are pending nationwide and several
companies have been forced into bankruptcy court by their asbestos
liability.
   The Manville trust faces about 130,000 claims. Weinstein ordered
its restructuring earlier this year after the trust ran out of cash
and offered IOUs to many victims that would not have been paid for
decades.
   The reorganization plan calls for Manville Corp. to inject up to
$520 million into the trust and allows the trust to sell $1.8
billion in Manville bonds to raise new cash.
   Claimants would receive sharply reduced payments, but faster.
Victims with cancer and other serious disease would get some money
in the plan's first two years. Those with other diseases would
begin getting paid in the third year. Payments would be 45 percent
of settlement values.
   The plan is expected to face legal challenges, and hearings are
planned in New York, New Orleans, Chicago and San Francisco.
   Weinstein favors creating a single fund to make payments based
on a proportion of available assets, eliminating long and costly
litigation.
   Kirkland agreed to help, saying ``recent events demonstrate that
the current system for compensating the working people who have
been injured by exposure to asbestos is seriously flawed.''
   Asbestos and products containing the mineral were used widely in
many industries for decades, with heavy use at shipyards around the
country during World War II and the Korean War.
   Asbestos, which has natural heat resistance and insulation
properties, later was found to cause lung cancer and other serious
dieases. Thousands of victims have died before receiving
compensation.

   The president of a Hercules Inc.
subsidiary has been named chairman and chief executive officer of
the parent company, officials announced Tuesday.
   Thomas L. Gossage, 56, president of Aqualon Co., takes over at
the Wilmington-based chemical company Jan. 1. He succeeds David S.
Hollingsworth, who had announced plans to retire.
   Gossage, who worked for Monsanto for 26 years, joined Hercules
in 1988 as president of Hercules Specialty Chemicals Co. In 1989,
he was named president and chief executive officer of Aqualon, a
Hercules wholly-owned subsidiary based in Wilmington that makes
water-soluble polymers.
   Gossage also joined Hercules' board of directors that year and
was made a senior vice president.
   ``Mr. Gossage has broad knowledge and experience in the chemical
industry, both internationally and in the U.S. In selecting him,
the board recognizes that during his career, Tom Gossage has
demonstrated the management and leadership skills needed to lead a
diverse, worldwide company like Hercules through the 1990s,''
Hollingsworth said.

<HEAD>Plans 20 Percent Cut in Payments to TV Network Affiliates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. announced a 20 percent slash in
payments to television network affiliates next year for carrying
its programs, the media giant's latest move to cushion the
financial shock of heavy spending on sports programming and an
industrywide advertising slump.
   CBS spent $153 million on payments to its 208 station affiliates
this year, so the cut on Jan. 1 should save the media company about
$30 million in 1991.
   But CBS also risks alienating or driving away affiliates. Some
rely heavily on the network compensation payment as a source of
revenue.
   ``We know this is not a popular decision,'' said CBS spokesman
George Schweitzer. ``But we are doing this to maintain the
financial support of the network business so they can benefit.''
   He said CBS has been spending more than either NBC or ABC on
payments to affiliates. NBC spent $132 million this year and ABC
spent $110 million.
   The CBS announcement comes a day after the company said it
expects to post a loss in the fourth quarter and lower earnings
next year.
   It cited the deteriorating national advertising climate and the
costs of entertainment and sports programs for its financial
forecast.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CBS lost $3.75 to
$156 a share after dropping $4 a share on Monday.
   CBS executives met privately Monday with representatives of its
network affiliates.
   Phil Jones, a former head of the CBS Affiliate Advisory Board
and an executive at Meredith Corp.'s broadcasting group in Des
Moines, Iowa, said, ``People were really disappointed'' by the CBS
decision.
   ``Its is a tough environment and some of them already feel
somewhat battered. But their argument about their losses are pretty
compelling,'' he said.
   CBS told the affiliate representatives that they were making
efforts to control costs in every phase of the company's operation
in drafting the 1991 budget. The company said it was compelled to
address affiliate payments also.
   In some ways, the affiliate payment system is outdated. It was
started as a way to ensure that the networks have a wide
circulation for their programs so they could charge advertisers for
delivering a national audience.
   But the development of cable television has taken a different
approach. Cable networks charge system operators for the right to
carry their services.
   Nonetheless, broadcast TV affiliates have in recent years
mounted strong resistance to efforts to reduce comnpensation.
   CBS feels it is in a better position this year to make the cuts,
however.
   Schweitzer noted that CBS is the ratings leader in daytime and
Saturday morning television and has shown improvement in prime
time.
   CBS has spent a lot to get better programs, he said. The network
has also spent heavily on obtaining sports rights over the past
year, including major league baseball, professional football and
the Winter Olympics.
   NBC has not yet announced plans on affilate compensation for
next year, a spokesman said. The ABC network plans no across the
board cuts but is reviwing compensation on a station-by-staion
basis as it has since 1988, a spokeswoman said.
   CBS is planning to help cushion the blow of the compensation cut
for its affiliates, Schweitzer said.
   CBS will give the local stations more commercial time in news
and sports programming to sell to local advertisers. In addition,
CBS said it would increase local commercial time on broadcasts of
the 1992 Winter Olympics.
   chweitzer said the extra ad time, which would be taken from the
time the network uses for station identifications and other
non-revenue producing activities, could mean up to $12 million in
extra revenue for affiliates.
   ``We have mutual stake in each other's financial health and
viability,'' said Tony Malara, president of CBS Affliate Relations.
``Given our improved programming performance, we need to insure
that our financial picture will be sufficient to continue to
support it.''

   Roseurg Forest Products is closing three
mills and laying off 700 people for at least a month in hopes that
the market for lumber and plywood will rebound, the company said
Tuesday.
   Layoffs at lumber and plywood mills have been common in the
Northwest as housing construction has slumped nationwide at the
same time log prices have risen regionally. Timber supplies have
shrunk amid efforts to preserve habitat for the northern spotted
owl and public demands for less logging.
   Roseburg personnel director Bob Wilson notified the Western
Council of Industrial Workers Monday that plants in Dillard and
Dixonville, employing 400 people, would be closed from Nov. 27 to
after Jan. 1.
   A notice at a third plant in Anderson, Calif., said it would
shut down Nov. 30 though the first of the year, said Lou Vess,
secretary at the International Woodworkers of America Local 3-433.
The mill employs 300.
   Earlier this fall, the company had shut down two mills in
Northern California, laid off 120 workers at another plant and
eliminated a relief shift at its Dillard complex.
   Roseburg, the nation's largest privately held wood products
company, has 14 mills and employs about 4,500 in southern Oregon
and Northern California.
   ``This is our first real cutback,'' said Roger Bissonnette,
assistant business agent for Western Council Local 2949. ``Most of
the others in the area have had their cutbacks.''
   Bissonnette said workers had expected bad news because of market
conditions and reduced timber harvests on federal lands.
   ``It's real tough coming right before the holidays,'' said Ted
Rabern, business agent for the union. ``But I honestly don't think
this was an easy decision to make for the company.''

<HEAD>Lack of Trade Pact Sends Grain, Soybean Futures Skidding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain traders sent prices into a skid at the Chicago Board of
Trade Tuesday, expressing their disappointment over the lack of any
food aid plan for the Soviet Union.
   Wheat lost 7 to 8 cents a bushel and hit contract lows across
the board.
   On other markets, livestock, meat, petroleum and precious metals
futures were all losers.
   During the two previous sessions at the Board of Trade, traders
had run grain and soybean prices up on rumors that a huge grain
deal was in the works.
   ``There are some pretty dire stories coming out of Russia about
the lack of vegetable oil, flour, potatoes, the lack of bread, even
the lack of salt,'' said John Frazier, agricultural director in
Chicago for Gerald Inc.
   ``It was very, very much expected'' that an announcement would
come out of the meeting Monday between President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he said.
   There may be an agreement yet, Frazier said, but the
disappointment was too great for the traders who had bought on the
rumors.
   Wheat settled 6 cents to 8{ cents lower with the December
contract at $2.45\ a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5} cents lower
with December at $2.21} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3\ cents
lower with December at $1.08\ a bushel; and soybeans were 6{ cents
to 12 cents lower with November at $5.57 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were down across the board at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The government's seven-state cattle-on-feed report released
after the close on Monday showed an increase in the number of
cattle placed in feedlots during October.
   This pressured prices for the more distant cattle futures
contracts when the October placements would be coming to market,
said Paul Hare, an analyst in Chicago with Linnco Futures Inc.
   Pork prices broke sharply, with bellies losing the daily trading
limit of 2 cents a pound.
   Live hog futures were confronted with a weaker cash trade, went
into a decline and triggered sell stops on the way down, Hare said.
   The market also was expecting lower cash hog prices again on
Wednesday as packers, faced with thinner profits, resist paying
more for the animals.
   Traders said the pork complex also suffered from the absence of
any trade deal with the Soviets.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .72 cent lower with the December
contract at 79.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with January at 87.60 cents a pound; live hogs
were .50 cent to 1.15 cents lower with December at 53.10 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies fell the 2 cent limit with February
at 70.20 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures declined on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, owing their weakness only partially to lower oil prices.
   ``People expect the metals to follow oil tick for tick, but they
haven't and they're not going to,'' said William O'Neill, an
analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch Futures.
   He also attributed the decline to selling in Europe,
options-related selling at the Comex and the nation's general
economic malaise.
   Gold settled $3.80 to $3.90 lower with December at $378.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents to 3.3 cents lower with December
at $4.11 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures declined sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders awaited the release of weekly industry
production and stocks data, which were interpreted as bullish when
they came out after the close.
   There was little fresh news from the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude oil was off 52 cents to $1.81 with the January
contract settling at $28.91 a barrel; heating oil was 1.30 cents to
2.85 cents lower with December at 84.45 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was 2.25 cents to 2.89 cents lower with December
at 77.47 cents a gallon.

at $377.60 a troy ounce, off $3.80 from Monday. Republic National
Bank also quoted a late bid of $377.60, down $3.80.
   The pound slumped against the dollar as well as other currencies
after the results of the vote for British Conservative Party
leadership were disclosed, traders said.
   Mrs. Thatcher failed by only two votes to gain a victory over
former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, forcing a second vote
next week.
   But ``there was information at least that she was supported by a
couple of her cabinet officers, so sterling is closing well off the

Rotterdam Bank in New York.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.9695 from $1.9745 late Monday.
In New York, one pound cost $1.9660, cheaper than $1.9750 late
Monday.
   The dollar ended marginally higher against the Japanese yen and
the German mark, but trading was too sparse ahead of the
Thanksgiving holiday to read much into these movements, McCarthy
said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 128.93 Japanese yen from
128.95 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at
128.65 yen. In New York, one dollar bought 128.85 yen at late
afternoon, up from 128.75 yen late Monday.
   In Europe, the dollar traded at 1.4760 German marks, up from
1.4745 Monday. In New York, one dollar bought 1.4740 marks,
compared with 1.4717 marks the day before.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.2450 Swiss francs, unchanged; 4.9760 French

Canadian dollars, down from 1.1634.

   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $377.75 a troy ounce,

Hong Kong, gold rose $2.75 an ounce to close at $380.30.
   Silver prices fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italtel SpA, an Italian telecommunications
equipment maker 20 percent owned by AT&amp;T, signed a joint venture
accord Tuesday with a Soviet company to produce digital phone
exchanges.
   Telezaria, as the joint venture is named, is 60 percent owned by
the Soviet company Krasnaja Zarja and 40 percet by the Italian
partner.
   Once it runs at full capacity, Telezaria expects to supply 25
percent of the Soviet telecommunications market, which plans to
have 100 million telephone lines installed by the year 2000,
according to a statement released in Milan.
   A spokeswoman for Italtel said her company will supply the
technology and equipment, while Krasnaja Zarja will contribute the
factory space and some of the production equipment for the new
company.
   She said the venture would start production in 1992 and reach
capacity of 1.5 million lines a year in about 5 years.
   Italtel is 80 percent owned by Stet Societa Finanziaria
Telefonica PA, the Italian state holding company for the
telecommunications industry, and 20 percent by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   Leningrad-based Krasnaja Zarja is the Soviet Union's largest
manufacturer in the telecommunications industry.
   Under the accord, the Soviet Union is committed to buy 85
percent of the joint venture's output. The remaining 15 percent
will be sold to countries with ``favorable trade agreements'' with
the Soviet Union, the companies said.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Decline On Middle East Developments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell sharply Tuesday as events
surrounding the Middle East convinced traders that a military
confrontation with Iraq was unlikely anytime soon.
   The January contract for light sweet crude, the benchmark blend
of U.S. oil, fell $1.81 to $28.91 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, erasing a $1.72 gain from the previous
session.
   Prices continued to bounce up and down in response to
developments in the Middle East. On Monday, prices shot up after
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced a military buildup.
   But Tuesday, ``(President) Bush's failure to secure an agreement
with Gorbachev on the U.N. resolution to authorize military action
was viewed as bearish by the market,'' said Andrew Lebow, an
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The Soviets on Monday and Tuesday rebuffed Bush's efforts to win
support for the resolution authorizing military force against Iraq,
and oil traders believed this made a confrontation - and a cutoff
of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf - less likely.
   Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev met on Monday, and
Secretary of State James A. Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze met Tuesday.
   Peter Beutel, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.
said the oil market also took a second look at Iraqi plans to move
another 250,000 troops into Kuwait and decided Monday's
announcement by the Baghdad government did not really exacerbate
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The troops have not yet been moved,'' Beutel said.
``Indications are they are not high-quality troops.''
   Analysts also said the political troubles of British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher also had a dampening effect on prices.
Mrs. Thatcher fell two votes short of defeating a challenge to her
leadership of the Conservative Party, and faces another vote next
week.
   The market believed that the British political turmoil makes
Mrs. Thatcher less likely to enter into a military conflict in the
Middle East, analysts said.
   Lebow said oil prices were also pulled lower by technical forces
in the market. ``The break below $30 was also viwed as bearish,''
he said.
   Prices for refined products traded on the mercantile exchange
also slipped.
   The December contract for home heating oil fell 2.31 cents to
84.45 cents a gallon, while wholesale unleaded gasoline for
December delivery tumbled 2.89 cents to 77.47 cents a gallon.
   After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute
announced that crude oil inventories fell slightly in the week
ended Friday, and gasoline and heating oil stocks also declined.
   The figures could move prices higher on Wednesday, although the
market is still focused primarily on the Middle East.
   In natural gas trading, the December contract rose to $2.380 per
1,000 cubic feet from $2.350 on Monday.

   The stock market fell Tuesday as traders ignored
the potential economic benefit of sharply lower oil prices and
ended a rally that began last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 35.15 points to
2,530.20.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
511 up, 1,043 down and 450 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.17 million
shares, up from 140.95 million on Monday. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on
regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled
195.60 million shares.
   Analysts were puzzled to see the stock market falling at the
same time oil prices were plunging and bonds were rising.
   ``The last few days, when oil was higher and bonds were cheaper,
it did better,'' said Danny Williams at Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc.
``Today, you've got oil lower and bonds higher and it's going
down.''
   Some traders might have been taking things easy with two days to
go until Thanksgiving, while others were selling stocks for
end-of-the-year tax purposes, analysts said.
   ``It's really being led down by the financial stocks,'' said
Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``It's as much
concern about the market rally failing as anything else.''
   The Dow Jones industrial average had posted an overall gain of
61.64 points last week, followed by a gain of 15.10 points on
Monday, before Tuesday's turn to the downside.
   As the financial issues took a hit, American Express was down 1&lsqb;
at 20{, Federal National Mortgage dropped 1 to 31|, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. was down 2 at 37}, Manufacturers Hanover fell
1&lsqb; to 18{ and Citicorp fell } to 12}.
   Among actively traded issues, Boeing Co. was down 4| at 42|,
after being downgraded by Goldman Sachs. In other aircraft stocks,
McDonnell Douglas Corp. fell 1| to 49~, United Technologies was
down 1 at 44|, Lockheed was down 1&lsqb; at 29} and Northrup was down &lsqb;
at 16{. Grumman Corp. was down \ at 17|.
   Among other active issues, Eli Lilley was down 2&rsqb; at 66
following a report on its market share that analysts viewed as
disappointing. General Electric was down 2&lsqb; at 53\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market dropped $31.139 billion, or 1.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.86 to 172.48.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.65 to 369.66, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 4.03 to 315.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
4.44 to 348.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 296.01, down .46.

<HEAD>GM Recalls 520,000 Cars for Potential Brake Light Malfunctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it was
recalling 520,000 1989-90 model cars for potentially defective
brake lights.
   The No. 1 automaker is recalling certain 1989-90 Pontiac Grand
Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes, Buick Regals and 1990 Chevrolet
Lumina cars, spokesman David Sloan said.
   The passenger cars may have a faulty electrical switch that
could result in the stoplamps not lighting when brakes are applied,
or staying on all the time, he said.
   Also, the company said, if the cruise-control function is
engaged, the cruise may go to the ``resume'' mode when brakes are
released. When that occurs, the cruise control can be disconnected
by moving the cruise switch to the off position or by reapplying
the brakes, GM said in a statement.
   The normal brakes are not impaired by any of the conditions, GM
said.
   Since 1989, GM has learned of 10 accidents, including four minor
injuries, in which the defect allegedly was present, Sloan added.
None of the accidents involved fatalities.
   GM sent notices to affected owners this week. GM dealers will
perform inspections and replace the stoplamp switch at no charge,
Sloan said.

<TEXT>
   In its latest courtroom fight over copyright
protection, Lotus Development Corp. went to trial Tuesday against a
small software firm accused of imitating Lotus' popular 1-2-3
business spreadsheet program.
   The case marked an extension of a trial Lotus won earlier this
year. Lotus, based in Cambridge, filed suit in 1987 against two
firms, Paperback Software International of Berkeley, Calif., and
Mosaic Software of Cambridge.
   It argued that the keyboard commands and on-screen images, the
so-called ``user interface,'' were an expression of an idea and
thus were protected by copyright laws. The company claimed the
defendants virtually duplicated the user interface of 1-2-3.
   Lotus won its case over Paperback Software in June, but Mosaic
had to drop out of that trial because an attorney for the company
became ill.
   Michael Collora, an attorney representing Mosaic, said on
Tuesday his client was bound by the decision against Paperback
Software in the proceedings that began Tuesday against Mosaic.
   But Mosaic officials insisted they received permission from
Lotus to develop a program that would be similar to 1-2-3.
   According to Mosaic's defense, Mosaic president Richard Bezjian
displayed a software program at a 1983 computer show, after the
unveiling of 1-2-3.
   Mosaic officials said Lotus founder Mitchell Kapor saw the
program and threatened to sue, but then an unidentified Lotus
employee later assured Mosaic that Lotus would not sue.
   Lotus argued that Mosaic has never been able to produce this
person.
   Mosaic continued work on the program and unveiled a different
version two years later, calling it ``Twin Classic'' and praising
the similarities with 1-2-3.
   Mosaic also argued that Lotus had the opportunity to sue earlier
but waited until other competitors came out with 1-2-3 clones.
   Since its victory over Paperback Software, Lotus has filed
copyright infringement suits against two other competitors, Santa
Cruz Operation Inc. and Borland International Inc.

   Federal securities regulators accused nine
people and a Rhode Island brokerage firm Tuesday of a massive
manipulation of seven penny stocks over a two-year period.
   Among those named in the civil complaint filed at federal court
in New York were three people convicted of stock
manipulation-related charges in the Haas Securities scandal.
   Those three were Eugene K. Laff and Stanley Aslanian Jr., former
principals of Haas, and Henry W. Lorin, a stock promoter and
director of three companies in which stock was manipulated.
   Lorin and Aslanian, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and
cooperated with prosecutors, both testified at Laff's 1989 trial,
which ended with his conviction on five counts of conspiracy,
securities fraud, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Lorin was later sentenced to three years in prison, Aslanian to
one and Laff to five years.
   The case against Laff stemmed from the government's first fraud
investigation after the 1987 stock market crash. Haas Securities, a
brokerage house, collapsed nine days after the crash.
   Prosecutors maintained that the firm's scheme to artificially
raise the prices of penny stocks - low-cost, high-risk securities
traded over the counter - couldn't be maintained after the market
dropped and the share prices fell.
   Laff, Haas' chairman, was convicted of being part of a scheme to
artificially inflate the penny stock prices by creating a false
demand for the shares and then selling out his firm's own stake
before the prices collapsed.
   The SEC complaint alleged that from October 1985 throught
October 1987, the defendants schemed to defraud the investors by
manipulating the over-the-counter market for seven penny stocks:
Big O Tires Inc.; Cliff Engle Ltd.; Digital Metcom Inc.; Flores de
New Mexico Inc.; Fountain Powerboat Industries Inc.; TS Industries
Inc. and Tunex International Inc.
   The scheme included planting negative news articles about the
companies, taking trading positions that would profit from a
decline in the stocks' prices and significant selling of
manipulated stocks by corporate insiders, the SEC charged.
   The complaint alleged that the manipulation scheme collapsed
after Haas ceased operations, causing the total market value for
the shares still held by investors to plunge more than $644
million.
   Also named in the civil complaint were Capital Shares Inc., the
North Providence, R.I. brokerage, and its owner, Lawrence Caito;
Toni Vallen, a New York investment adviser; Rosario Ruggiero, and
Edward J. Barter, both former Haas employees; Enn Kunnapas, an
employee of Lorin's, and Paul L. Miano, a head trader at J.T. Moran
&amp; Co. Inc., a brokerage that went out of business in January.
   The SEC is seeking court orders barring the defendants from
future alleged securities law violations as well as repayment of
alleged illegal profits by Capital Shares, Ruggiero, Laff and
Vallen.

   Digital Equipment Corp. announced Tuesday
it would close a plant in Phoenix and eliminate more than 400 jobs,
which might require the first layoffs in company history.
   Digital, which has been slashing its payroll for months to cope
with a slump in computer sales, said it would try to find other
slots in the company for some workers.
   Also, Digital plans to offer a financial package similar to a
severance program the company has used to encourage workers to
voluntarily leave their jobs.
   ``We hope to do this without a layoff and preserve choice, but
it's possible we may not be able to do that,'' Digital spokesman
Jeffry Gibson said.
   Digital President Kenneth Olsen has said repeatedly the computer
company hopes to avoid layoffs, but he could not offer any
guarantees.
   The Phoenix facility employs 476 people, down from a payroll of
1,800 workers several years ago, Gibson said.
   No timetable has been set for the actual closing or for shifting
businesses away from the site.
   The Phoenix site has several operations, including a low-volume
manufacturing plant for printers and a distribution center.
   Digital, which recorded its first-ever quarterly loss earlier
this year, cut its payroll by 3,000 positions in its last fiscal
year. This year, the company plans further cuts of 5,000l news wires for

   ATLANTA - A flashpoint of the Cold War is now a focus of the
cola war. U.S. soft drink makers Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have been
pouring millions of dollars into establishing a presence in what
formerly was East Germany, gearing up to win the battle for taste
buds in a region that for almost half a century was closed to such
Western products.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Reviewing Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday reviewed a
$300 million reorganization plan for Sharon Steel Corp., but did
not sign proposed orders.
   Judge Warren Bentz wanted to consider the matter further,
according to his law clerk, Ronald Cook.
   Bentz has said previously that creditors for the nation's
18th-largest steelmaker apparently favored the plan 9-to-1.
   Bernhard Schaffler, special counsel to the bankruptcy trustee,
has said that the plan was expected to gain approval. The plan
could be enacted by mid-December.
