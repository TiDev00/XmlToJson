   Jesse Helms, the archduke of Senate
conservatives, is battling the State Department again. And his
private war is gumming up President Bush's diplomacy.
   This is a tale of three diplomats who want to be ambassadors but
whose careers have gotten tangled up in a mixture of Senate
politics and personal grudges.
   A fourth candidate lost out when his nomination was withdrawn as
the result of objections from the host country.
   Helms, R-N.C., is angry at the administration over its
nomination of George Fleming Jones as ambassador to the tiny South
American state of Guyana.
   Helms suspects Jones of involvement in the 1986 leak of a secret
Chilean military report about the death of an American during a
violent protest in Santiago, according to a source who asked not to
be identified.
   Helms was infuriated when his own office was blamed for the
leak. He has told the State Department that unless it provides 1986
cables from the U.S. Embassy in Chile, where Jones was posted, he
would keep blocking the confirmation, the source said.
   Helms' parliamentary maneuvering to block a Senate committee
hearing on Jones' nomination also wound up delaying confirmation
hearings for two other ambassadorial nominees - G. Philip Hughes
for Barbados and John P. Leonard for Suriname.
   While the appointments aren't high-level, they illustrate the
convoluted dealings of the Senate and the protracted nature of the
confirmation process. The administration submitted the nominees'
names several months ago and the diplomats may have to wait until
the new Congress convenes next year before their cases are
resolved.
   Helms is an old hand at manipulating ambassadorial nominations,
using them as bargaining chips in wheeling and dealing with
colleagues and the administration. The 68-year-old standard-bearer
of anti-communism is running for a fourth Senate term neck-and-neck
against Democrat Harvey Gantt.
   One of his better-known maneuvers was a six-month ``hold'' on
the 1987 nomination of April Glaspie to become ambassador to Iraq.
He took to the Senate floor last month to say his objections had
been vindicated.
   Glaspie has come in for stinging criticism over her failure to
tell Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the United States was
angry about his threats against Kuwait. Having reported to
Washington that there was no cause for concern, she left on
vacation a day before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is upset at Helms' delay
tactics, according to a congressional source who demanded
anonymity. But he's even more angry at the administration for
nominating Hughes.
   Hughes served as secretary of the president's National Security
Council during the Iran-Contra affair. Dodd wants to ask him
whether he knew that NSC aide Oliver North was illegally arranging
to give the Nicaraguan Contra rebels money from U.S. arms sales to
Iran.
   Dodd also objected last year to the nomination of Hughes' boss,
Donald Gregg, to be ambassador to South Korea. Dodd contended that
Gregg knew of North's doings, but Gregg eventually was approved.
   The fourth nomination, Frederick Vreeland to be ambassador to
Burma, is being withdrawn, the State Department said Thursday
night.
   A State Department official, who asked not to be identified,
said Vreeland's name is being withdrawn because of objections from
the military authorities of Burma about pro-democracy statements
Vreeland had made during Senate testimony.
   But Vreeland's nomination had been in trouble from the start.
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., had asked Helms to block a vote on
his confirmation, and Helms obliged.
   D'Amato - who isn't a member of the Foreign Relations Committee
- and some committee members were furious at the State Department
for representing Vreeland as a foreign service officer at a time
when he worked undercover for the CIA.
   Vreeland, by the way, is the son of the late Vogue magazine
editor, Diana Vreeland.
   Some of Vreeland's conservative critics also questioned why,
while serving at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, Vreeland played down the
role of Soviet and Bulgarian intelligence in the 1981 assassination
attempt of Pope John Paul II.

<HEAD>Keating Fundraiser Linked to Riegle Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundraiser hosted by savings and loan
operator Charles H. Keating Jr. plays a major role in a
recommendation that an ethics investigation proceed against Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., say sources familiar with the inquiry.
   Just weeks after the March 23, 1987, fundraiser for Riegle, the
Michigan Democrat and four Senate colleagues met with U.S. banking
regulators on behalf of Keating - a political donor to all five.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is trying to establish whether any
of the five senators were influenced to help Keating by the $1.3
million he and associates donated to the lawmakers' campaigns and
causes.
   Congressional sources previously confirmed that special counsel
Robert S. Bennett had recommended that the investigation continue
against Riegle and Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Bennett also proposed that Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and John
Glenn, D-Ohio, be dropped from the investigation.
   The committee now is at a juncture where it can advance some or
all the cases to expanded levels of inquiry, including public
hearings, or dismiss senators from the probe.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
earlier this week that any links between the senators' actions and
the timing of political donations are crucial to Bennett's
recommendations.
   Sources said Thursday that the fundraiser Keating held for
Riegle is one of the links cited by Bennett. Riegle has said the
proximity of the event and the sessions with regulators were
coincidental.
   One source said Bennett is ``throwing up for the committee the
possibility that when a political contribution is so close to an
event, is there a way it cannot be connected?''
   Riegle's case could be the most difficult of the five. The two
senators that Bennett recommended dropping, McCain and Glenn, broke
off contacts with banking regulators after an April 9, 1987,
meeting attended by all five lawmakers.
   The five senators were told during that session that criminal
referrals would be made to the Justice Department on the conduct of
Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Cranston and DeConcini continued their contacts with regulators
until April 1989, when Lincoln was seized by the government -
leaving the taxpayers to cover losses that could exceed $2 billion.
The two senators said the contacts after April 1987 were in support
of a sale of Lincoln that could have saved jobs.
   Riegle has said he ended his intervention with regulators, as
did Glenn and McCain, after the April 9 meeting.
   But in Riegle's case, Bennett's report gives weight to the
timing of the fundraiser hosted by Keating on March 23, 1987, and a
meeting a few weeks earlier - on March 6 - between Riegle and the
top S&amp;L regulator at the time, Edwin J. Gray.
   Riegle acknowledged that he suggested to Gray that the regulator
meet with senators concerned about the treatment of Keating's S&amp;L.
Although Riegle said he did not arrange it, such a meeting was held
on April 2, 1987, between Gray and Cranston, DeConcini, McCain and
Glenn.
   Gray contends the senators offered a deal to aid Keating's
operation at that meeting, but all four senators vigorously deny
the allegation.
   In contending there was no connection between the fundraiser and
the intervention with regulators, Riegle has said the event was
scheduled two months earlier.
   Riegle raised $78,250 from Keating and associates in the event
at the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit, owned by Keating. In 1988, a
year after the event, Riegle announced he returned the money
because it could ``create the appearance of a conflict of
interest.''
   Meanwhile, McCain met with the Ethics Committee privately
Thursday, as Glenn had done the day before.
   Emerging after about three hours, McCain said he ``felt good''
about the session and predicted he would be exonerated before the
Senate adjourns later this month.
   Cranston, Riegle and DeConcini are to appear before the
committee over the next two weeks.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Changes Perceptions But Not the Policy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, through some fancy rhetorical
footwork, is moving toward a more moderate public stance on the
Persian Gulf crisis in an apparent bid to recruit more Arabs into
the anti-Iraq cause.
   Until his speech at the United Nations this week, the
administration had left open the possibility of a long-term
American presence in the gulf and of fashioning a U.S.-led security
alliance for the area to ensure future stability.
   The administration also resisted any linkage between the gulf
and the Arab-Israeli disputes, implying that the respective
conflicts had more differences than similarities.
   Many Arabs, although troubled by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
also are wary about what they perceive as massive U.S. interference
in the region. To the extent that there are Arab hearts still up
for grabs, Bush is trying to woo them - and what better forum to do
that than the U.N. General Assembly.
   In his speech, without repudiating what he and his subordinates
had said previously, the president quietly shifted the focus on
several sore points in a way that was more palatable to Arab
opinion.
   Bush did what presidents often do: he didn't change the policy,
only the emphasis.
   The administration had left the impression that the U.S.
military forces might be in Saudi Arabia for the long haul, but
Bush offered a different spin when he said those forces will not
remain there ``for one day longer than is necessary.'' Once their
mission is completed, ``every single American soldier'' will be
brought home, he said.
   These comments seemed aimed at Arab critics who, although
opposed to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, feel offended that
American infidels are armed to the teeth and wandering around
Islam's most sacred turf.
   In this category is Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khameini who, while no friend of Iraq, invited states of the region
last month to ``fight America's aggression'' in the ``cause of
Allah.''
   Bush also appeared to put to rest the notion that the answer to
long-term gulf stability is an American-led military alliance.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III raised that possibility a
month ago in congressional testimony, but the president said such a
task should be left to the gulf states themselves.
   Bush thus indicated an awareness about Arab sensibilities about
American influence in the region.
   In his speech, the president stressed his interest in a
diplomatic solution in the gulf, declining to repeat his earlier
warnings that the presence of 1,000 or so American hostages in Iraq
and Kuwait will not deter him from taking military action against
Iraq.
   He also offered something for Arabs who support the restoration
of Kuwaiti sovereignty but who are embittered by Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Once Iraq leaves Kuwait unconditionally, Bush said, ``I truly
believe there may be opportunities ... for all the states and
peoples of the region to settle conflicts that divide the Arabs
from Israel.''
   Put another way, Bush implied that unless Saddam Hussein
withdraws from Kuwait, no one should expect any progress toward an
Arab-Israeli settlement.
   Previously, the administration had rejected even a hint of
linkage between the two conflicts. As officials see it, restoration
of Kuwaiti authority would not threaten Iraq, but the establishment
of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza would threaten
Israel unless ironclad guarantees are negotiated.
   In that sense, the two issues are not viewed here as analogous,
but Bush made the link anyway without giving anything up. After
all, it's campaign season and, like any good politician, Bush is
looking for support.

   Republican Senate candidate Allen Kolstad
has the White House on his side, but Sen. Max Baucus has the money,
the lead and widespread appeal among rural Montana voters.
   Kolstad, the state's lieutenant governor, is a wealthy rancher
and grain farmer who is trying to tar Baucus as a liberal in favor
of big government. Kolstad's conservative pitch even includes a
reminder that he ``opposes Ted Kennedy on most national issues.''
   But Baucus pays close attention to rural and economic concerns.
Pet issues include aid to rural hospitals, Essential Air Service
subsidies for rural airline routes and agricultural trade. He voted
against the 1990 farm bill, saying it didn't do enough for farmers.
   Kolstad was at least 20 points behind Baucus in an independent
mid-September poll. In addition, the Republican is up against the
largest campaign bankroll in Montana history.
   Baucus raised $1.9 million in the 18 months ending in June, a
princely sum in a state with only 800,000 people. Aggressive
fund-raising efforts continue.
   Baucus says he's just taking precautions.
   Kolstad had only $267,000 in campaign funds on June 30, but if
the race gets closer, he may look to national GOP groups for
eleventh-hour fund-raising help.
   That approach worked in 1988, when political newcomer Conrad
Burns narrowly upset two-term Democratic Sen. John Melcher of
Montana to become the first Republican U.S. senator from this state
in 36 years. The huge infusions of cash used to help Burns are
being challenged in a lawsuit and in a complaint before the Federal
Election Commission.
   ``If someone unfairly attacks me, I'm going to respond,'' says
Baucus. ``I just have be to prepared for the possibility that I'll
face the same deluge of dollars.''
   In the 1988 race, Burns, a former farm-and-ranch broadcaster,
attacked Melcher as a liberal out of touch with conservative, rural
Montana.
   Kolstad has adopted the same strategy.
   ``More federal bureaucracy, more federal control, the higher
deficits - there are the things I'm going to be fighting against in
Washington,'' says Kolstad.
   Like Burns, Kolstad was recruited by national GOP heavyweights,
including President Bush and former President Reagan. Bush raised
more than $100,000 for Kolstad when the president traveled to
Montana in July.
   Kolstad cannot claim the mantle of political outsider. He spent
20 years in the Montana Legislature before winning the lieutenant
governorship on the GOP ticket with Gov. Stan Stephens in 1988.
   The Stephens-Kolstad adminstration has not been universally
popular in Montana, struggling with tax and budget issues and
controversial appointees. Recent polls show his ``negatives''
nearly doubled since a similar poll in mid-June.
   Kolstad, 58, says he is saving his money for a last-minute
barrage of media advertising attacking Baucus on his votes against
defense spending, tax cuts and budget-balancing measures.
   The 48-year-old Baucus, running for a third term, has been
working hard to dispel whatever liberal image he may have had.
   He earns relatively high marks from most liberal interest groups
but insists he doesn't care about ratings.
   ``I don't look left, I don't look right, I look forward - to
what is the best solution for Montana,'' says Baucus. ``Most people
are more concerned with producing results for Montana than with
labels.''
   Baucus has barely mentioned Kolstad in campaign materials,
preferring instead to emphasize efforts he says have created or
protected jobs in economically depressed Montana.
   While differences between the candidates exist - Baucus is
pro-choice on abortion, Kolstad is not, for example - the race has
generated few fireworks.

   ``The Flash,'' CBS' superhero action show, has
sprinted away from a Thursday night ratings battle with ``The
Simpsons'' and ``The Cosby Show.''
   Beginning on Oct. 25, the Scarlet Speedster will start a half
hour later, (8:30 p.m. EDT Thursdays) leaving the animated Simpsons
of Fox Broadcasting Co. to do battle with Cosby's NBC sitcom, CBS
announced Thursday.
   ABC, NBC, and Fox executives said Thursday there were no changes
to be announced in their respective schedules.
   ``In its two outings, `The Flash' has created tremendous
excitement for younger viewers,'' said Peter Tortorici, CBS' senior
vice president of program planning. ``By moving to 8:30 we feel
that an even larger number of those viewers will have a chance to
see it.''
   In addition, CBS said the environmental action show ``E.A.R.T.H.
Force'' has been placed on hiatus and ``Lenny'' has been put on
indefinite hold.
   ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' was an eco-failure in the ratings and with
critics, who complained that it was underwritten, overacted and
that the capital letters and periods in the show's title were too
difficult to type.
   It finished 85th in last week's A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, and
its last broadcast was Sept. 29.
   ``Lenny,'' which stars Lenny Clarke, will return to the schedule
in a time period soon to be announced, CBS said. It ranked 78th
last week, and its last episode aired Wednesday at 8 p.m. EDT.
   ``We are anxious to see it back on our schedule in a time period
where more viewers will be available to enjoy it,'' Tortorici said.
   Moving ``The Flash'' to 8:30 makes it one of the few hourlong TV
shows ever to start on the half-hour. ``Top Cops,'' the
reality-based police drama, will oppose ``Cosby'' and ``The
Simpsons,'' and CBS' sitcom ``Doctor, Doctor'' will move in from
Wednesday nights to follow ``The Flash.''
   On Oct. 24, CBS News' ``48 Hours'' will move from Saturday
nights into the vacancy left by ``Lenny'' and ``Doctor, Doctor,''
the network said.
   CBS also said the Oct. 25 premiere of ``Sons and Daughters,'' a
multi-generational family drama, would be delayed ``until a later
date.''
   ``Wiseguy,'' starring Steven Bauer, will return to the CBS
schedule on Nov. 17 with a two-hour season premiere before moving
to its 10 p.m. EST time slot, CBS said.
   CBS also announced that ``Broken Badges,'' a police show about a
unit composed of psychologically and emotionally troubled officers,
will begin with a two-hour special Nov. 24 before moving to its
regular Saturday night slot.

   The small central African nation of
Rwanda faced a population and ecological crisis even before it was
invaded this week by armed refugees from neighboring Uganda.
   An exodus of Asian businessmen from their adopted country was an
ominous sign of deteriorating conditions, including overpopulation,
soil erosion and AIDS.
   Western experts say more than 50 families of mainly Indian and
Pakistani origin have left Rwanda in recent months in search of
fresh opportunities in neighboring Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire -
countries also suffering from poverty, disease and violence.
   Reflecting the trend, the black market price for U.S. dollars,
preferably in $100 bills favored for smuggling, shot up to more
than double the bank exchange rate of 68 Rwanda francs per dollar.
   Aid agencies estimate that fewer than 500 Asian families remain
in a population of about 8 million people crammed into a rugged
landscape only the size of Maryland.
   Western experts warn that a human and environmental disaster
might occur in this decade in the former Belgian protectorate,
which gained independence in 1962.
   The ecological balance is already threatened.
   Early this year at least 300 people died in sporadic outbreaks
of famine in the remote south, said a Western aid worker
interviewed by The Associated Press last month in Kigali, the
capital.
   In the west, Lake Kivu, running most of the way along the border
with Zaire, had little fish life left because of caustic runoff
from cultivated volcanic uplands nearby.
   Rwanda is Africa's most densely populated country, with an
average of 566 people living on every rocky and eroded square mile
of land.
   The government of President Juvenal Habyarimana reports the
average Rwandan woman bears 8.6 children, the highest birth rate in
the world. At the present rate, the population will double by the
year 2006.
   ``Land pressure is critical. There are simply too many people
living on too little land,'' said the aid specialist, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Annually, cultivated land loses at least 1.5 inches of topsoil
to erosion. Crops are grown on 60-degree slopes, and in other areas
the level of acid in exhausted soil is a fraction away from the
reading that would classify the land as barren.
   In 1981, the average Rwandan's daily nourishment amounted to
2,511 calories. It dropped to 1,804 calories in 1990, and current
projections indicate the figure will sink to about 1,400 calories
by the year 2,000.
   The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says that
adults need a basic minimum of 2,100 calories a day to lead a
healthy life.
   In 10 years, experts predict, hunger will be widespread and food
aid will be needed on a scale not seen since the Ethiopian famine
of the mid-1980s.
   Even if all the remaining patches of nature preserve and forest
were turned over to agriculture, additional food production ``would
only cover the population growth for two years,'' a Kigali-based
European researcher told the AP.
   ``Without the forests acting as water-retaining sponges, the
ultimate ecological collapse would hasten,'' said the researcher,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Rwanda's towns, where only 5 percent of the population live,
up to 40 percent of the people are estimated to be infected by the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a mainly
heterosexual disease in Africa.
   A large proportion of these may die within the next decade, say
hospital officials. Also, 1 in every 5 babies born in the towns can
be expected to die before age 4, having contracted the AIDS virus
in an infected mother's womb.

   John Lennon's 50th birthday will be marked with
a celebration beyond even the slain rock star's utopian vision: his
peace anthem ``Imagine'' playing simultaneously for 1 billion
people in 130 countries.
   ``This idea appealed to me, because not only will we cover the
whole world, but also there's something that's very small,'' said
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, who will speak briefly before the song is
played Oct. 9 at 10 a.m. EDT.
   ``It's not a pandemonium. And I thought that was in John's
spirit in a way - we didn't believe in pandemoniums. We believed in
just an honest kind of communication.''
   Lennon was gunned down outside his Manhattan apartment house in
December 1980.
   The 10-minute event will be broadcast worldwide from the United
Nations, and will also feature a short introduction by Marcela
Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary general.
   A taped message from Lennon will be broadcast before ``Imagine''
is played.
   ``There's no commercials. There's no sponsors. It is a pure,
simple, very touching event,'' said Jeff Pollack, the radio and
television consultant who came up with the idea.
   As of Thursday, more than 1,000 radio stations and networks from
50 countries had signed on for the satellite broadcast. U.S. Armed
Forces television and radio will hit another 80-plus countries. The
event will also air on MTV in 25 countries, said network
spokeswoman Andrea Smith.
   Pollack, the head of the California-based Pollack Media Group,
said the idea came to him after an April meeting with Ono where
they discussed possible tributes for the 50th birthday.
   ``I was riding around in a cab in New York City, and then
`Imagine' came on the radio. It just flashed: what if we played
this song around the world?'' said Pollack.
   He made the proposal to Yoko, who gave it the go-ahead. Ono
believes the recent events in Germany, Eastern Europe and
particularly the Middle East point up the importance of Lennon's
peace message.
   ``When this was discussed, we had no knowledge of what would
happen in Iraq and Kuwait, you know. And now it seems very
appropriate that this be sung all over the world,'' said Ono.
``It's going to be sung in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I don't know, the timing is incredible. It's beyond me ...
It's beautiful.''

   Actress Jaclyn Smith says television has treated
her better than the silver screen.
   ``I've been offered Hollywood parts, but they were as an
`armpiece' or decoration. Or there was nudity,'' the ex-Charlie's
Angel says in this Sunday's Parade magazine.
   ``And they were just not as good as the parts I get in
television.''
   Smith, 42, admits she's happy working in TV, although Broadway
could lure her from the tube.
   ``Broadway ... now that would be something else. I'd love to do
a stage musical,'' she said.
   Smith, who has appeared in several television movies and
miniseries, stars in the NBC movie, ``Danielle Steel's
Kaleidoscope,'' later this month.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters says
there's something about diamonds that make you smile.
   McGuire, 59, who says her jewelry collection is one of the
largest in the nation, put part of it on display Wednesday for the
first time at a jewelry store near the strip, as a favor for friend
and shop owner Wayne Christensen.
   ``No two stones are alike,'' said McGuire, pointing to a canary
yellow 42-carat diamond ring she was wearing and one in a display
case. ``Each have their own personality.''
   McGuire, who keeps expensive pieces in Las Vegas and New York
bank vaults, declined to reveal their value, saying only that it
was ``in the millions.'' She and sisters Christine and Dorothy
amassed a slew of gold records in the 1950s and '60s as one of

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Gene Autry, owner of the California
Angels since the baseball team's founding in 1961, has passed on
the duties of club president so he can devote more time to his
Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles.
   Autry, who turned 83 last Saturday, said Thursday the move
represents a withdrawal from the daily demands of the team's
affairs.
   ``It just got to be too much for me,'' the former movie cowboy
said at an Anaheim Stadium news conference. ``I've been so involved
with other things. I'll no longer have to take phone calls every
day about the team.''
   Named as Autry's successor was Richard M. Brown, an attorney who
has represented Autry's broadcasting empire since 1981 and has sat
on the Angels' board of directors since 1986.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Rapper Will Smith, better known as The Fresh
Prince, says he may have grown up too fast.
   ``I started my music career at 16, moved out of the house when I
was 18 - got my own house, had a car and was worrying about having
my taxes done when other kids were going to the prom,'' Smith said.
   Smith, 22, who now stars in NBC's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,''
said in this Sunday's Parade magazine he's now making up for his
lost teen years.
   ``It would have been nice to have a few more years just hanging
out. So I'm indulging my young tendencies now,'' he said. ``I just
bought my Nintendo yesterday, and I have it set up in the living
room.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - ``Saturday Night Live'' regular Kevin Nealon
took custody of three monkeys abandoned by a Soviet circus that
went bankrupt during a U.S. tour.
   Nealon said Wednesday the Bim Bom circus left the monkeys behind
because of ``behavioral problems.''
   ``They looked like there was no fight left in them. They looked
angry and upset and helpless. It made you want to cry,'' said
Nealon's wife, Linda.
   The couple, who took custody of the monkeys on behalf of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said they hoped to return
them to the wild, where they would not be subjected to trainers'
discipline.
   The last of the original 115-member circus returned to the
Soviet Union on Aug. 23.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Percussionist Alvin Patterson of
the Jamaican reggae group The Wailers, formerly led by Bob Marley,
is recovering in Brazil after undergoing surgery following a
stroke.
   ``Alvin was moved out of intensive care today,'' Sallim Emed,
director of the Cajuru Hospital in Curitiba, said Thursday. ''The
surgery was successful nd there were no complications.''
   Patterson suffered the stroke Sunday shortly before a scheduled
concert in Curitiba, a city 1,500 miles southwest of Rio. The
operation was performed Tuesday morning.
   The Wailers, one of Jamaica's most popular reggae bands, were in
Brazil for a series of concerts. Marley died in 1981 at age 36 from
brain cancer.

<HEAD>Administration Drawing Less Ambitious Star Wars Blueprint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is revising its Star
Wars plan to build a defense against limited strikes from enemy
missiles instead of an all-out attack by the Soviet Union, the
project's director says.
   The change reflects the administration's view that improved
U.S.-Soviet relations and the collapse of communism make it less
likely that Moscow would unleash its arsenal of thousands of
globe-circling nuclear ballistic missiles.
   It also points up a decline in congressional support for
spending billions of dollars a year on the Strategic Defense
Initiative, commonly called Star Wars, and the administration's
desire to deploy some form of missile defense system in the
mid-1990s.
   The new system, not yet officially announced, is being designed
to defend against ``tens or hundreds'' of missiles fired
accidentally by the Soviets or deliberately by a Third World
renegade leader, rather than the thousands of missiles that would
be expected to fill the skies in a full-scale strike by Moscow.
   Henry F. Cooper, the Pentagon official in charge of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, said in an interview Thursday that
the revised anti-missile system could be deployed more quickly than
the system originally envisioned.
   He said he could not give a target date for deployment or a
precise estimate of the cost.
   ``I would say it's still somewhat uncertain but obviously less
than'' the Pentagon's estimate of $55 billion for the initial phase
of the current Star Wars plan.
   About $20 billion has been spent on Star Wars research since
1984. The administration is requesting $4.7 billion for Star Wars
in the current budget year, but Congress is expected to shave at
least $1 billion off that figure. The House's version of the 1991
defense budget set Star Wars spending at $2.3 billion.
   Cooper, who last July took over as the first civilian director
of Star Wars, said he decided to push the less ambitious plan in
hopes of winning a consensus in Congress that at least a limited
defense against missiles is feasible. If that is accomplished, he
said, then the administration might eventually gain the needed
political support and financing to expand the system.
   He has nicknamed the new approach the Protection Against Limited
Strike system.
   ``It would not constitute an effective defense against a massive
raid, but would provide protection - not deterrence but protection
- against an accidental or unauthorized and even deliberate
terrorist attack of, I don't know, tens or hundreds'' of missiles,
he said.
   Cooper also raised the possibility that the initially deployed
system might exclude the space-based weapons that have been at the
heart of Star Wars since former President Reagan launched the idea
in 1983 as a way to end nuclear confrontation.
   ``In my mind it would involve space- and ground-based elements
both,'' Cooper said, but later he added: ``We may dispute about
whether space-based elements are required - I don't know.''
   Inclusion of space-based weapons is controversial because the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibits space-based defenses.
Washington is pressing Moscow to agree to modify or drop the ABM
Treaty to permit a transition from a nuclear balance based on
offensive threats to one based on defense.
   Cooper, a quiet-spoken former chief U.S. negotiator at the
superpower Defense and Space Talks in Geneva, said his ideas for
transforming the Star Wars program originated in a classified
review he conducted for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney shortly
before he replaced Gen. George Monahan as the program director.
   He said his review found serious problems in the ground-based
elements of a ``Phase One'' deployment of Star Wars weapons.
   Phase One included ground- and space-based satellites to detect
missile launches and track their trajectory; a constellation of
space-based rockets to knock down the missiles in space;
ground-based rockets to destroy missiles re-entering Earth's
atmosphere; a ground-based radar to help guide the interceptor
rockets, and a command center for human management and control of
the battle.
   Cooper said the revised plan calls for fewer and differently
designed ground-based rockets, a vastly reformulated ground-based
radar, and fewer ``brilliant pebbles,'' or space-based rockets that
would vaporize enemy missiles by ramming them.

   David Souter says he will live up to his
monkish, bookish, workaholic image when he joins the Supreme Court
next week, but he also hopes to do a few ``touristy things'' after
he moves to Washington.
   Souter, whose primary after-work pleasure seems to be more work,
said this week he expects that he will stick to his office and
lawbooks at least for his first year in the nation's capital.
   ``We all know the work load there is enormous,'' he said Tuesday
in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I realize what I'm
getting into. I intended to work a long week anyway, but I imagine
I'm going to have my limits tested.''
   He said he understands his fellow justices want him to start as
soon as he is sworn in Tuesday morning.
   ``They very muchwwanted me to start sitting Tuesday because
there is always the possibility of a 4-4 decision if they're
sitting without a full complement,'' Souter said.
   What little free time Souter may have already is being mapped
out for him by the district's social set. An article this week in
The Washington Post named the 51-year-old jurist the city's most
eligible bachelor, which Souter said ``sounds pretty good to me.''
   ``I've really got to wait and see what effects it brings,'' he
said.
   Potential dates might prepare themselves for a trip to the
Smithsonian Institution or the Lincoln Memorial.
   ``There are some things that I have never done that most school
kids have done,'' Souter said. ``I have never, for example, toured
the Capitol.''
   He did manage a brief peep at the building's Rotunda as he
called on members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in July.
   ``I said to the man from the White House who was with me, `I've
just got to go in and look at this for a minute,''' he said. ``I
kind of gawked around until I realized that people were moving
their eyes from the murals to me, so I retreated. ...
   ``Someday - I may have to do it with a paper bag over my head -
but someday I'm going to do some of those touristy things that I
would really like to do.''
   His one well-known recreation - hiking - may have to wait until
he's able to return to New Hampshire's White Mountains.
   ``I don't expect much,'' he said. ``Years ago, I did get down
into the Blue Ridge (Mountains) once. I'd like to see them again,
but we'll have to wait and see. I just don't think there's going to
be much time for those excursions.''
   His last weekend before joining the court will be spent finding
somewhere to live and reading briefs.
   Souter said his lack of preparation - no apartment, no law
clerks, no secretaries - wasn't carelessness, but simply practical.
He worried the Senate might not approve his nomination.
   ``You can chalk it up maybe to, as one of my friends says, a
nautical superstition,'' he said. ``Maybe I read too many Greek
tragedies. I don't believe something's going to happen like that
until it's happened.
   ``Even apart from that, I think if I were a member of the Senate
and I realized somebody was out lining up law clerks or apartments
or anything else, I think I would regard it as extraordinarily
presumptuous.''
   Lining up an apartment, however, should not be hard. Souter's
living requirements are simple - he told friends that all he wants
is a bedroom big enough for a bed, a living room big enough for a
chair, a kitchen and a bathroom.
   He plans to live in the city for his first year, but later may
move, like his high court colleagues, to the Maryland or Virginia
suburbs.
   ``I, after all, have been spending the last 23 or 24 years of my
life with a ... 25-minute commute,'' he said. ``I realize it's not
so easy, (but) you don't have to look out for cows down there.''

<HEAD>Government Underestimates Poor, Experts Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are 13 million ``hidden poor'' people in
America, those living in destitution but not counted by the
official government measure of poverty, the head of a House
committee says.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of the Select Committee on
Hunger, said Thursday that Census Bureau poverty statistics
released last week rely on a poverty line standard that is outdated
and understates the problem.
   The Census Bureau's statistics for 1989 show an overall poverty
rate of 12.8 percent, or 31 million people - about what it was the
year before.
   ``These rates, as shameful as they are, mask the real depth of
the problem,'' Hall said as he opened a hearing on the need for
adjustments in the official government poverty measurement.
   ``Thirty-one million is millions short of what the American
people and many scholars think about the number of poor
Americans,'' he said, citing studies that put the figure 13 million
higher. ``Thirteen million hidden poor. With these additional poor,
we're talking about one out of every five Americans living in
poverty.''
   The official poverty line is based on government measurements
established in 1963. There have been annual adjustments since then
to account for inflation, but witnesses told the panel those
adjustments haven't been adequate.
   ``That measure represented a reasonable estimate of minimum
family needs in 1963, but it has never been updated to reflect
changes in consumption patterns and standards of living since the
early 1960s,'' said Patricia Ruggles, an economist with the
congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   ``In fact, that measure is based on consumption data from the
mid-1950s,'' she said.
   The poverty scale was based on estimates of minimum adequate
food budgets and then tripled, on the assumption that food
represents about one-third of total expenditures, Ruggles said.
   The scale has not been changed to reflect that the average U.S.
family now spends 42 percent of its income on housing, she said, or
that fewer families have the services of a full-time homemaker to
take care of young children. It also does not consider differences
in cost of living between regions or urban and rural areas.
   Updated scales based on more modern estimates of food and
housing costs would raise the poverty threshold more than 50
percent to $14,000 to $16,000 or more for a family of three in
1988. The official poverty measure is $9,435, she said.
   Two government benefit programs whose eligibility standards are
tied directly to the official poverty measure - food stamps and
Medicaid - use cutoffs substantially higher, around 130 percent of
the poverty line.
   ``These higher eligibility thresholds are perhaps an implicit
acknowledgement that our current poverty thresholds do not
represent a realistic minimum standard of consumption,'' Ruggles
said.
   A bill passed by the House would provide for a National Academy
of Science study of revisions to the poverty line. It awaits Senate
action.
   Hall said many were reluctant to redraw the poverty lines
because the numbers of poor would be increased. But he said a more
accurate count ``will lead to a new sense of just how urgent our
fight against hunger and poverty in America really is.''
   William P. O'Hare, director of policy studies for the Population
Referece Bureau, a liberal advocacy group, cited polling for his
group that showed the public believes actual poverty begins at a
higher income.
   ``Use of the official poverty measure distorts our understanding
of poverty and understates the dimensions of poverty and hunger in
America,'' O'Hare said. ``Nearly 13 million people who have incomes
just above the official poverty line are not counted as poor by the
government, but are considered to be poor by their neighbors.''

<HEAD>House Foe of Arts Endowment Vows to Fight Compromise Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher says he'll fight a new
compromise bill on the National Endowment for the Arts as a piece
of ``flimflummery'' that will do nothing to halt federal support
for obscene and sacrilegious art.
   The California Republican, a staunch conservative and ardent foe
of the federal arts agency, said he will seek to defeat the
bipartisan measure drafted by Reps. Pat Williams, D-Mont., and E.
Thomas Coleman, R-Mo. The House begins debate on the proposal next
week.
   ``It's a sham and a facade to deceive the voters,'' Rohrabacher
said. ``It's a total fraud. It portends to offer some kind of
restrictions on federal funding for obscenity, when in reality it
opens the floodgates.''
   Williams and Coleman, who announced agreement on their
compromise Thursday after weeks of intensive negotiations, proposed
to extend the NEA's life for three years and let the courts decide
whether federally subsidized arts projects are obscene.
   Rohrabacher said their bill was ``the type of flimflummery that
makes Americans cynical about the politicians in Washington.''
   He said it reflects the Democratic leadership's loyalty to ``a
fringe of freak artists who insist they have the right to federal
tax dollars to produce pornography and sacrilegious art.''
   Rohrabacher says he will introduce a floor amendment that would
prohibit NEA support for a laundry list of taboos, including
obscenity, indecency, child pornography and works that attack
religion, desecrate the American flag or contain any part of a
human fetus.
   Coleman and Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., hinted that the real aim
of Rohrabacher and his conservative allies was to dismantle the NEA
or abolish it entirely.
   ``The question is whether to dismantle this agency or make it
better,'' Henry said. ``This bill would make it better.''
   Williams predicted that their measure ``will pass the House by a
significant majority of both Democrats and Republicans.''
   The bill could provide House members a way to defuse the
politically explosive issue of federal support for ``obscene art''
in an election year.
   The controversy began 18 months ago when conservative lawmakers
and religious fundamentalists attacked the NEA for subsidizing
exhibitions of works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano, which they denounced as obscene and blasphemous.
   The Williams-Coleman compromise would forbid the endowment from
financing obscenity. But it would shift from the NEA to the courts
the burden of deciding what is obscene, based on the Supreme
Court's 1973 guidelines.
   Under the bill, any grant recipient who is convicted of
violating obscenity laws would be required to repay the government
and would be barred from receiving further NEA grants for at least
three years.
   In a bow to Republican demands, the bill also would boost the
states' share of NEA grant money from 20 percent to 35 percent over
the next three years. Coleman originally had sought to shift 60
percent of NEA funds to the control of state arts agencies.
   The measure also would make sweeping changes in the endowment's
grant-making procedures with the aim of making the NEA more
accountable to the taxpaying public. It would bolster the NEA
chairman's authority to make final grant decisions, and dilute the
panels of outside artists and arts managers which select grant
applications for approval.
   Similar legislation is awaiting Senate floor action. Also headed
for the House floor is a separate bill to provide $180 million in
NEA spending next year, a 5 percent increase over its current $171
million budget.
   Meanwhile, NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer and evangelist Pat
Robertson clashed again Thursday over Robertson's claim that
federal funds supported an Atlanta puppet show featuring simulated
oral sex.
   In a Sept. 28 letter to Robertson, released Thursday, Frohnmayer
vigorously denied that any NEA funds were spent on the puppet show
or its sponsor, the Arts Festival of Atlanta.
   Robertson ignored Frohnmayer's demand for a public retraction of
his ``categorically false'' allegation. The evangelist told his
television audience that if members of Congress vote to give the
NEA more money next year, ``it shows they are totally out of touch
with America and with morality.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Theater Bows to Pressure, Cancels Showing of First
NC-17 Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEDHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A movie theater bowed to pressure from town
officials and canceled the showing of ``Henry and June,'' the first
film rated NC-17, the designation that replaced the X rating.
   Showcase Cinema was to have started screening ``Henry and June''
today. The film based on the diaries of Anais Nin chronicles her
affairs with writer Henry Miller and his wife.
   ``They can call it whatever they want to call it,'' Anthony
Taurasi, chairman of the town's board of selectmen, said Thursday.
``If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it's a duck.
Let's call it what it is.''
   The Motion Picture Association of America replaced the X rating
with the NC-17 rating on Sept. 26. NC-17 means no one under age 17
can be admitted to the films.
   Selectman Frank Geishecker told The Patriot Lddger of Quincy on
Wednesday he would consider revoking the theater's license if the
film was shown.
   ``We are not censors,'' he said. ``The censoring is done by the
rating bureau. All we care is that we preserve the community
standards of the town of Dedham. That is our mission, that is our
job.''
   Both selectmen admit they have not seen the film released by
Universal Pictures. Directed by Philip Kaufman and starring Fred
Ward and Uma Thurman, ``Henry and June'' received the NC-17 rating
because of two lesbian sex scenes and a shot of an erotic drawing.
   Ira Korf, chief executive of Showcase Cinema's parent company,
National Amusements Inc., said he pulled the film from the Dedham
theater because of complaints from the two selectmen.
   ``I pointed out very strongly this film wasn't rated X,'' said
Fred Mound, president of distribution for Universal Pictures.
``There was extreme pressure coming down. Obviously, I'm very
disturbed by it.''
   The MPAA switch was made exactly to avoid these situations,
Mound said. The association changed the designation because the X
rating carried the stigma of pornography.
   Korf said National Amusements had decided to show NC-17-rated
films because the new rating means they cannot be confused with
hard-core pornography films.
   Taurasi said that Showcase Cinema had a gentleman's agreement
with the town not to show X-rated films that the NC-17 rating was
``just a way around the ratings bureau.''
   Dedham is a middle-class suburb with more than 25,000 residents,
about 10 miles south of Boston.
   ``Henry &amp; June'' was to have opened on 77 screens in 31 cities
in the United States and Canada today. Instead of ``Henry and
June,'' the Dedham theater will show the action-adventure movie
``Darkman.''

   Palestinian groups are increasingly
threatening retaliation for any harm that comes to Iraq, especially
at the hands of the United States.
   A group called the Palestinian Popular Army-Black Panther Forces
faxed a statement to The Associated Press bureau in Nicosia late
Thursday headlined ``Warning'' in bold letters.
   ``The tempo of imperialist threats against Iraq is increasing
day after day with the aim of bringing Iraq to its knees through
hunger,'' said the Arabic language statement.
   ``Orders have been issued to our forces wherever they exist for
immediate retaliation on land, sea and air against the aggressor,
should Iraq be subjected to any aggression,'' it said.
   Not as much is known about the group, which has been active by
issuing similar statements since the Kuwait invasion. The group is
believed to be supportive of Fatah, the main branch of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   It was the third such threat in two days by radical
Palestinians.
   The threats have heightened fears of a terrorist campaign
against the Western and Arab nations confronting Iraq since the
Persian Gulf crisis began.
   Iraq has been isolated by the international community since Aug.
2, when it seized Kuwait. Since then a U.S.-led multinational force
has been sent to the region, and the U.N. Security Council has
imposed a land, sea and air embargo on Iraq to try to force it to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   The U.S. State Department Saturday warned Americans traveling
abroad that they run the risk of Iraqi-sponsored attacks ``in the
near future.''
   The Arab Liberation Front, based in Baghdad, said in a statement
Thursday it ``will respond decisively and immediately with powerful
strikes if Iraqi civilian aircraft are endangered by the United
States.''
   ``All American interests in the Arab world and in the world at
large will not be far from the hands of the revolutionaries who
will prove that the whole universe could be a battlefield so that
the Americans will know what kind of foe they face,'' the statement
said.
   It was published in Baghdad's al-Thawra daily, the newspaper of
the Iraq's ruling Baath Socialist Party.
   The Arab Liberation Front, which has a few hundred men, has not
been very active since it and other PLO factions were forced to
evacuate Beirut in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It
is led by Abdul-Rahim Ahmed, a member of the PLO's executive
committee.
   Thursday's warnings came a day after the Palestinian guerrilla
leader who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise
liner Achille Lauro said he would attack U.S. aircraft if Iraqi
planes were struck in the air embargo.
   Abul Abbas, head of the radical Palestine Liberation Front,
called the air embargo ``the operation of air piracy by one state
against another to serve its narrow-minded interests.''
   Abul Abbas' statement was published Wednesday in Al-Jumhuriya,
another government-run daily in Baghdad.
   Abbas did not specify what action would be taken. But extremist
Palestinian leaders based in Iraq have specialized in attacks on
airliners and airports in the past.

   Soldiers call this
recreation outpost Panther Paradise, but it hardly lives up to its
name.
   Some soldiers pass the time racing beetles or watching scorpions
fight.
   Others try to run pass patterns on a more or less flat patch of
sand that serves as a football field.
   Still others congregate at the PX, a metal shipping container,
or the cinema, a tent with some cots and a television set showing
Marlon Brando mumbling his way through ``The Godfather.''
   Four hundred yards away, the M-1 tanks of the 2nd Battalion,
69th Armor Regiment, known as the Panthers, lie in wait under
camouflage netting, ready to roar into action if the order comes.
   ``Paradise is OK, but I wish it was a little farther to the
rear,'' said Spec. Kristopher McCoy, 20, from Ft. Wayne, Ind.
   The battalion clerk was among the two dozen troops who on
Thursday were enjoying a two-day break from the rigors of training.
But they were also waiting, possibly for war with Iraq.
   The U.S. military command is formulating a policy to allow
troops rest and recreation outside Saudi Arabia. Last weekend, the
command opened its first full-fledged R-and-R center in the country
at a location off limits to everyone else.
   In addition, individual units have been ordered to set up rest
centers close to their front-line positions. This spot, known by
the soldiers as Panther Paradise, is one of the first.
   ``If it got any better than this, I wouldn't know what to do,''
said command Sgt. Major Tim Gabel of Forth Worth, Texas, watching
Brando from the doorway of the darkened movie tent where cool is
only a relative term.
   Sgt. 1st Class Richard Hawk of Atlanta, who runs the operation,
said the portable showers and wooden-floored tents, including the
cinema, are about as luxurious as it can get in the desert.
   A trio of soldiers tossed a football around, but they quit after
a few minutes of trying to run pass patterns in the loose sand.
   Hawk said that in addition to watching beetles and scorpions,
the soldiers occupy themselves playing volleyball, chess, checkers,
darts and card games.
   ``I'd like to have basketball, too, but this stuff ain't too
swift,'' Hawk said, kicking the sand.
   He said he paid $1,500 for chips and dips so the troops can
munch away while watching videotapes. Soldiers can also do their
laundry and get haircuts.
   ``Some other units have PXs and some might have a VCR, but even
people from brigade headquarters come down here,'' he said. ``We
don't turn anybody away.''
   Staff Sgt. Raymond Horne, 24, of Brooklyn, N.Y., stands behind
the PX counter, selling cigarettes, snacks, magazines and other
items. The cold drinks are free. So is the advise he dispenses.
   ``Basically, the soldiers want to know when we're going home,''
he said. ``I tell 'em, six months - hopefully.''

<HEAD>Slam Dunk Basketball Hoops? Some Would Bench the Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neighborhood beautifiers who say
driveway basketball hoops are eyesores want to slam dunk them all.
Opponents eager to bench the plan say it's un-American.
   ``What's the point of having the pristine appearance in Garden
City if it's not for our children to enjoy,'' Donna Robins, the
mother of three ball-playing boys, said at a village trustees
meeting Thursday night.
   Others in town - including New York Knicks Hall of Famer Dave
DeBusschere and ex-New York Nets guard Bill Melchionne - are
mounting a fast break to overturn the town's policy.
   The flap actually began two years ago, when the affluent Long
Island town included basketball hoops under a 1924 law banning
``accessory structures.''
   Free-standing basketball hoops on the side and front of homes
were deemed unacceptable. Hoops attached to homes or garages or
free-standing hoops located in back yards were allowed to remain.
   About 60 people, most of whom opposed the ban, crowded into the
small village hall Thursday night.
   Joseph Asselta, an attorney with two boys and a hoop out front,
said he would take the town to court if officials order him to take
the basket down. He called the action unconstitutional because town
officials had not uniformly enforced the 66-year-old law.
   The trustees were unmoved. They said letters will be sent
immediately to 72 homeowners with offending hoops, giving them 90
days to comply.
   People who decide to flaunt the law and keep their rims intact
face up to a $250-a-day fine, although they should be able to
appeal to the local zoning board.
   ``I think it's absurd, and it seems ridiculous,'' said
Melchionne, who played on the ABA champion Nets in 1974 with Julius
Erving. ``If they don't have the availability of hoops, who knows
what kids will do?''
   DeBusschere echoed those comments to The Associated Press after
returning from a trip to the Soviet Union.
   ``I don't buy the idea that it's an eyesore. I think it enhances
a neighborhood. It humanizes it,'' said DeBusschere, who has a hoop
hanging - legally - in his back yard.
   ``The sound of a dribbling basketball and the swish of a
successful jump shot are the sounds of youtfful energy. ... It is
as American as apple pie,'' said village trustee Jack Curry, who
offered an alternate plan that was voted down.
   Mayor John McGowan, a member of the anti-hoops troops, shot
back: ``Garden City has nothing against anything all-American. The
village wants to keep Garden City beautiful, keep its aesthetic
beauty.''
   Curry's compromise would have saved all but three of the
existing hoops, and ensured all future buckets were 30 feet from
the nearest street. That plan was recently rejected by a 5-2 vote.

<HEAD>Loss of Privately Owned Wetlands Dropped in Mid-1980s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department survey shows the
loss of wetlands on private lands nationwide slowed significantly
during the mid-1980s.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Thursday that the new
figures by the department's Soil Conservation Service, or SCS,
indicated wetland losses ranged between 100,000 and 200,000 acres
per year from 1982 to 1987, including areas that reverted to open
water.
   This was ``significantly less'' than wetland loss estimates
before 1982-87, he said.
   No previous SCS estimates were available. Spokeswoman Diana
Morse said the agency began its five-year surveys in 1977. The new
figures comparing 1987 with 1982 were the first, she said.
   Estimates used in the surveys were based on information
collected on 300,000 sample sites across the nation.
   The latest figures came from the agency's 1987 National
Resources Inventory, or NRI, which is conducted on non-federal
lands every five years in cooperation with the Iowa State
University Statistical Laboratory.
   Officials said the inventory serves as the principal source of
information on the status, condition and trends of soil, water and
related resources. It also provides a soil-and-water data base for
non-federal rural lands.
   The report said there were about 82 million ares of wetlands on
non-federal rural lands in 1987, down from 83.2 million acres in
1982.
   However, SCS estimated the loss of wetlands to agricultural and
development uses at ``closer to 500,000 acres,'' or an average of
100,000 acres per year.
   ``The remaining change in wetlands was due to factors such as
300,000 acres changing from private to federal ownership - still
likely remaining in wetlands but not included in the SCS
non-federal lands inventory - and over 400,000 acres that changed
to open water, primarily adjacent to the Great Salt Lake in Utah
and in southern Louisiana,'' the report said.
   Of the nearly 500,000 acres lost to agriculture and development,
about 215,000 were converted farmland, including wetlands drying up
because of drought, and about 280,000 acres to development.
   Regionally, the NRI indicated wetland losses over the five-year
period were greatest in the Southeast, Mississippi Delta states,
and the Great Lakes states.
   Losses were reported at 170,000 acres in the Southeast, 150,000
in the Delta, and 80,000 in the Great Lakes.
   Morse said there were no available breakdowns by state and that
the SCS considered those estimates too inexact for publishing. She
said the regional estimates were the only ones available.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Farm cooperatives, hurting badly a few years
ago from the financial crunch on producers, have recovered most of
their old zing, an annual report by the Agriculture Department
shows.
   In 1989, the report said, co-ops reported their second-highest
net income and third-highest sales.
   Overall, combined business volume was shown at $70.4 billion, up
6 percent from $66.4 billion in 1988. That was topped only by the
record $73 billion in 1984 and the $71.5 billion in 1981.
   Net incomes in 1989 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, the report
said. That was up 12.3 percent from 1988. The record was $1.94
billion in 1980.
   Randall E. Torgerson, administrator of the department's
Agricultural Cooperative Service, said the higher business volume
was due mostly to larger output of grains and oilseeds, higher
price for poultry and higher prices and sales of fruits and
vegetables, fertilizers and farm chemicals.
   Production of feed grains and soybeans was up sharply last year
from 1988, when drought reduced yields.
   Increased earnings of farm supply co-ops were ``a major
contributing factor'' to the near-record income, despite a increase
in the number of cooperatives reporting losses in 1989, the report
said. Those increased to 574 from 364 in 1988. However, the amount
of losses decreased to $82.4 million last year from $164.7 million
the previous year.
   Total cooperative business volume includes the value of products
marketed; the sale of farm supplies such as fertilizer, chemicals,
fuel and feed to members and other customers; and receipts from
services, including trucking, storage, ginning and artificial
insemination.
   Torgerson said the number of farm cooperatives and members
continued a longtime downward trend.
   Co-op units declined to 4,799 last year from 4,937 in 1988, he
said. Memberships dropped 1.4 percent to 4.14 million. The number
of memberships exceeds the number of farms because many farmers
belong to more than one co-op.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - An Agriculture Department scientist says that
after 10 years he is close to developing a soybean that has both
high protein and high yields.
   Plant geneticist Joseph W. Burton of the department's
Agricultural Research Service said in a report that preliminary
results show a boost in protein content to almost 47 percent from
about 42 percent.
   The preliminary results also show excellent yields for the new
bean, he said. Overall, it could mean a possible boost in revenue
to soybean producers of $1 to $1.50 per bushel.
   Burton, who works at the agency's soybean and nitrogen fixation
research unit in Raleigh, N.C., said it will take another year of
testing to determine how best to make commercial use of the new
bean.

<HEAD>Arianespace Chairman Calls for Equity in Pricing, Market Access</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new chairman of Arianespace, the European
satellite launching company, says it is time the space-faring
nations of the world have an equal footing in both their pricing
policies and access to markets.
   Arianespace will not be able to continue its 10 years of
successful growth ``if our competitors do not respect the same
rules, the same manner of behavior,'' said Charles Bigot, who took
over as chairman and chief executive officer two months ago.
   ``We are facing two kinds of competition,'' he said at a news
conference Thursday. ``We are facing competition against American
launchers, which are (in) the same kind of economy as Ariane, but
we are facing also competition from Soviet launchers, Chinese
launchers, which are coming from non-market countries.''
   In the competition with the United States, Bigot said,
Arianespace hopes to get agreement to open the launch market to
everyone. The European firm, he said, has access to only one-third
of the market, since the United States will not allow military and
government satellites to be launched overseas.
   ``We consider our American competitors have access to all the
market and we hope that in fact, Europe and the United States would
get some agreement in order to open all the market to all the
launch vehicle companies,'' he said.
   Bigot said, too, he would like to see a change in the pricing
policies of American launch firms.
   ``There is a small, but important difference between the
launcher in the United States and the launcher Ariane about fixed
cost,'' he said. ``Fixed cost is what you have to pay to maintain
facilities and the tools for producing the launcher.''
   In the United States, Bigot said, the governmental market pays
for the fixed cost while commercial customers bear only the
additional expenses for a given launch.
   ``The way has to be different,'' said Bigot. ``You have to
divide all the fixed cost by the number of launches and you have to
attribute to each launch the pro rata part of the expenses.''
   Through American accounting, the cost is lower ``and we insist
to have the same kind of rules on both sides of the Atlantic,'' he
said.
   Bigot said precautions must be taken with the competition from
the Soviet Union and China, which do not operate in a free market
economy.
   ``It is obvious they are not at all evaluating their cost in the
same manner,'' he said. ``In fact, they don't know exactly their
cost because they are not the same accounting system.''
   Arianespace proposes that Europe and the United States work
toward an agreement with those countries which would allow for an
intermediate phase while they develop their economies. During that
phase, they would be expected to ``self-limit'' their marketing
activities, Bigot said.
   ``After this period, we could accept free access to the market -
when they demonstrate that they have adopted the same rules for the
economy,'' he said.
   In the first half of the 1980s, satellite owners depended on the
space shuttle to launch their cargoes. But after the Challenger
accident in 1986, then-President Reagan ordered the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration out of the commercial launch
business and encouraged private industry to step in.
   Orphaned by the new policy and by a shortage of launch vehicles,
many satellite companies turned to Arianespace, giving that firm a
major boost.
   ``We created and developed the commercial space transport
business,'' Bigot said. ``At first we were a challenger. Now we
consider in the commercial market we are the leader.'' In the past
three years alone, 30 satellites have been launched on Ariane
rockets.
   The three major players on the American launch market are
McDonnell Douglas, which makes the Delta rocket; Martin Marietta
with its Titan series and Genral Dynamics with the Atlas. All
three rocket families are also used to lift military and government
satellites into orbit.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man introduced to the Senate as a veteran
diplomat, but described in published reports as a longtime CIA
agent, is being dropped as ambassador-designate to Burma.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Thursday the State Department
told him Frederick Vreeland's nomination would be withdrawn.
   A department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the decision to withdraw Vreeland's nomination, saying
the Burmese refused to accept him after he made statements urging
democratic changes in the Southeast Asian country.
   The pro-Democracy statements were described as nothing more than
``oft-stated U.S. policy.'' Burma's military junta has refused to
yield power to a civilian government elected in May.
   But D'Amato said he did not believe that was the real reason for
dropping Vreeland.
   The senator said he had planned to question Vreeland about
evidence that he led efforts to cover up Bulgarian and Soviet
involvement in the 1981 attempted assassination of Pope John Paul
II.
   However, the State Department official who spoke of condition of
anonymity said the attempt to kill the pope had nothing to do with
the matter.
   D'Amato said that by law he could not comment on whether
Vreeland was a CIA agent.
   Several published reports have identified Vreeland as an agent
working under a diplomatic cover. He was listed in his official
biography as an embassy officer in Rome in the years following the
papal shooting incident.
   The biography supplied to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
by the administration described Vreeland as a career diplomat with
several State Department assignments. Vreeland, 63, is son of the
late Vogue magazine editor, Diana Vreeland.
   Journalist Claire Sterling, in a 1984 book about the
assassination attempt, said Vreeland warned her not to pursue the
Bulgarian angle and told her she was on a Bulgarian hit list.
   D'Amato said he recently spoke with Sterling about her
allegations and also had some first-hand knowledge of Italian
officials' anger over Vreeland's activities in Rome. Ali Agca, a
Turk who wounded the pope in St. Peter's Square, is serving a life
term in Italy.
   Agca at first said he acted alone but later claimed Soviet
involvement. An Italian court ruled there was not enough evidence
to convict three Bulgarians charged in the case.
   D'Amato said he has met with the new president of Bulgaria,
Zhelyu Zhelev, who has said he will pursue an inquiry into any
Bulgarian connection to the attempt on the pope. D'Amato said he
also wants an inquiry into any U.S. efforts to cover up.
   The motive for the coverup, said D'Amato, may have been to
prevent an escalation of U.S.-Soviet differences or to prevent
facts from coming out that might be embarrassing to U.S. officials.
   A closed-door hearing on the nomination was held in the Senate
on Monday, but Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., held up committee approval
of Vreeland after getting a letter from D'Amato.
   While the State Department official confirmed withdrawal of the
nomination, department spokesman David Denny said he had no
official release on it.
   Denny said Assistant Secretary Richard Solomon and Burmese
Deputy Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw met on Wednesday. He said Solomon
urged the seating of the elected civilian government, protested
harassment of U.S. embassy employees in Rangoon and called for a
crackdown against opium production in Burma.
   But Denny declined to give details of Gyaw's response and said
he did not know whether there was any discussion of Vreeland's
nomination.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Iraq Has Explosive Device Equivalent to Small Nuclear
Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has high-explosive devices that pack the
equivalent destructive power of small nuclear bombs, a newspaper
reported today.
   The fuel-air explosives, or FAEs, have 10 times the power of
conventional explosives and create a huge fireball and shock wave
over a concentrated area, without the radiation fallout associated
with nuclear weapons, The Los Angeles Times reported.
   ``It's not your garden-variety weapon,'' said Henry Sokolski of
the Pentagon's international security affairs office. ``These are
blast-effect weapons, and what you can't see can kill you.''
   Military officials say the United States has no ready defense
against the explosives that could devastate oil fields, air bases
and troops, the newspaper reported.
   FAEs can be launched as bombs from airplanes or as warheads on
missiles.
   Pentagon officials said U.S. forces would have the most
difficulty defending against a missile-delivered warhead, but there
is no clear evidence Iraq has the ability to mount the explosives
on missiles.
   Senators John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Jesse Helms, R-North Carolina,
are among five senators who have requested in a letter to Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney that he launch an investigation to determine
Iraq's supply of FAEs.
   The Times said earlier reports indicated Iraq received the
scientific knowledge to build these weapons from the German arms
industry.
   A major German aerospace and defense firm,
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm conducted feasibility studies on an FAE
device as part of a missile project with the Egyptian government.
That project was terminated in 1988, said company spokesman Willie
Vogler.
   According to reports from the BBC and Der Spiegel, a German
magazine, Egypt gave the studies to Iraq.
   An unidentified congressional investigator told the Times that
U.S. technology may have been involved as well, although the United
States does not carry FAEs in its own arsenal.
   The weapons are currently in the arsenals of the Soviet Union,
Israel, China, France, West German, Spain, and perhaps some Third
World nations in addition to Iraq, according to Pentagon sources.

<HEAD>NEA Chairman Says Evangelist Should Apologize for Arts Festival
Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Arts-Obscenity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the National Endowment for the
Arts says evangelist Pat Robertson should apologize for providing
``misinformation'' about whether federal money was used to produce
an adult-oriented puppet show.
   NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer said Robertson misrepresented the
truth about the source of funding for the show in Atlanta last
month. The evangelist blasted the show on his ``700 Club'' TV
program, saying it was produced with NEA grant money.
   ``This show was privately funded,'' Frohnmayer said at a news
conference Thursday. The head of the federal arts agency was in
Atlanta to address local arts leaders and reply to Robertson's
charges.
   ``I would call on Rev. Robertson to apologize to Congress to
whom he has sent misinformation; to apologize to the people of
Atlanta whom he has cast in an unfavorable light; to apologize to
those who look to him for truth, rather than half-truths,''
Frohnmayer said.
   ``We're not going to apologize for speaking the truth and
bringing the facts to light,'' Robertson spokesman Ralph Reed said
later Thursday.
   Robertson said in his Thursday morning broadcast that if members
of Congress vote to give the NEA more money next year, ``it shows
they are totally out of touch with America and with morality.''
   His remarks were the latest attack on Atlanta puppeteer Jon
Ludwig's play ``Zeitgeist,'' which premiered Sept. 21 at the
Atlanta Arts Festival.
   Robertson previously charged that the puppet show included
simulated foreplay, followed by an exhibit of oral sex acts, before
an audience of 800 people, including children.
   Ludwig described the scene as a satirical treatment of sexual
temptation, as part of an adult ``morality play.'' He denied it
contained depictions of oral sex.
   Robertson, who was a Republican candidate for president in 1988,
said Thursday he had not seen the puppet show, but based his
criticism on newspaper accounts.
   The Christian Coalition, a non-profit organization headed by
Robertson, has reported that the NEA gave $132,500 last year to the
Center for Puppetry Arts, where Ludwig is associate artistic
director.
   Reed, who is executive director of the Virginia Beach, Va.,
coalition, said Ludwig ``would never have been offered the
opportunity to put on that puppetry show if he hadn't been artistic
director of one of the largest puppetry arts centers in the
southeastern United States.''
   While the NEA acknowledged the funding, Frohnmayer said Ludwig's
performance at the arts festival was under a separate arrangement
``independent of his association with the Center for Puppetry
Arts.''
   The controversy began with the complaint of the Rev. John
Norton, a Methodist minister from Marietta, who later withdrew his
objections. While Norton said he did not object to the show's
content, he said unsupervised children should not be allowed to
view adult material.
   Festival organizers have said they will take steps in the future
to make sure children will not have access to such material.
   In an indirect reference to Robertson, Norton said, ``We do not
feel it is appropriate for us to be placed in the position of being
connected with the greater issues others have attempted to draw us
into.''

<HEAD>Arms Control Treaty Will Lock in Reductions Under Way in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tentative accord to cut non-nuclear
weapons in Europe will lock in reductions now under way and lay out
the basis for new relations between East and West, military experts
say.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty would be the largest
arms-control deal in history and the first in Europe since the end
of World War II. The agreement, announced Wednesday in New York, is
expected to be signed by 22 countries next month in Paris.
   President Bush on Thursday hailed the tentative accord, which
would take a far bigger bite out from the Soviet arsenal than the
American one. Bush said it would ``decisively improve the balance
of military power'' on the continent.
   Military analysts said the agreement makes it harder for the two
sides to change their minds on pullouts that have already been
started.
   ``It makes official and irrevocable these changes,'' said
Richard Fieldhouse, senior research associate at the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Washington. ``Unilateral moves are a
little too easy to reverse.''
   ``In a sense, we are now writing the armistice for the Cold
War,'' James Woolsey, the chief U.S. negotiator to the talks, said
recently.
   The talks have been designed to bring both sides to equal
ceilings in main battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery,
combat aircraft and attack helicopters.
   The talks, covering an area spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the
Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union, are between the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization of the West and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Even before the signing ceremony, the Soviets have begun pulling
equipment out of East European countries, once their staunch allies
but now governed by emerging democracies eager to pull away from
the Kremlin.
   A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets already have withdrawn about 20,000 tanks from the region.
   The Soviets also have begun removing their troops from Hungary
and Czechoslovakia.
   Still, experts say putting the reductions in writing is
important.
   ``If this were all done without a treaty, you would just be
taking the other guy's word for it that their equipment had been
taken out of service,'' said the NATO official.
   The arms talks, which seemed so far-reaching at their start,
have lagged behind the political and economic upheavals in Eastern
Europe. The negotiations initially were considered a way of forcing
change in the East.
   ``The important thing about the treaty is not so much what it
limits, but the fact that it's part of a process that you can build
a new political relationship on,'' said Jane Sharp, senior
researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
in Sweden.
   The treaty will set out an extensive system of inspections on
military bases and other areas to make sure no country cheats.
   The two sides have agreed to limit main battle tanks to 20,000
for each side, artillery pieces to 20,000 apiece, armored combat
vehicles to 30,000 each, and combat helicopters to 2,000 apiece.
   No cap has been negotiated on combat aircraft. However, after
long negotiations, bargainers agreed to a limit of 5,150 warplanes
in any single country, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
at a joint appearance with Bush in Washington on Thursday.
   The agreement technically does not limit the number of U.S. and
Soviet troops in Europe. The superpowers agreed to skip that step
to meet the Paris deadline.
   However, Gorbachev and Bush, to a far lesser extent, are
committed to withdrawing soldiers from Europe anyway.

   Stock prices closed sharply higher in Tokyo Friday,
while the dollar plunged against the yen.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
rebounded 549.46 points, or 2.47 percent, to close at 22,827.65.
Volume was an estimated 450 million shares on the first section.
The index shed 571.20 points, or 2.56 percent, falling to 22,278.19
Thursday.
   The dollar closed at 133.72 yen, down 2.18 from Thursday's
close, after trading between 132.75 yen and 133.80 yen. The
currency started trading at 133.60 yen, down 2.30 yen from
Thursday's close.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds dropped to 8.110 percent by 3 p.m. from
Thursday's 8.235-percent close. Their price rose to 83.15 points
from 82.63.
   Traders said advances overnight in Europe and New York, coupled
with slightly lower oil prices and the stronger yen contributed to
the rebound. Higher bnd prices and comments by U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday also fueled
expectations of lower interest rates.
   Greenspan, speaking before a congressional committee, hinted at
an easier credit policy from the central bank if Congress enacts a
compromise on cutting the federal deficit.
   ``The Japanese investor's mind is very, very good compared to
just one or two weeks ago,'' said Hidetada Yoshida of Kidder
Peabody International Corp.
   The prospect of lower interest rates in the United States gave
investors hope that the Bank of Japan might also lower rates,
boosting industrial activity, he said.
   ``Investors have digested the conflict in Iraq with the United
States, (by) about 80-90 percent. I expect the Nikkei will be up
around 26,000 sometime in December,'' he said.
   Low stock book values also spurred buying, and while foreign
institutional investors were taking the bait, he said. ``Japanese
institutional investors are very, very chicken because they
received huge damages from this crash,'' he said.
   As of Thursday, the Nikkei average had lost 27.76 percent of its
value before Aug. 2, when Iraq touched off the Persian Gulf crisis
by invading Kuwait.
   Also on Friday, one of Finance Ministry's market-boosting
measures went into effect, increasing the collateral value of
securities used in margin deposits.
   On currency markets, Greenspan's interest rate comments and
concerns about the U.S. budget pushed the dollar sharply down.
   ``The dollar's drop was fueled by speculative dollar selling in
London overnight,'' said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst
with New Japan Securities Co.
   He said pessimism over prospects for the approval of the 1991
U.S. budget proposal and over the scheduled announcement of the
U.S. jobless rate later Friday also prompted the dollar-selling
incentives among Japanese investors.
   ``With little fresh market-affecting news here, however, the
dollar will not fall too much in Tokyo,'' Kanai said. ``Many market
players are awaiting release of the U.S. jobless rate.''
   The dollar dropped against all major foreign currencies
overnight in New York due to selling on a widespread assumption
that U.S. interest rates will fall in the near future. The dollar
in New York closed at 133.83 yen from 136.04 yen.
   Dealers said the latest dollar selling was triggered by
Greenspan's comments. A looser monetary policy would lead to lower
U.S. interest rates, which would tend to curb dollar demand by
making returns on dollar-denominated investments less rewarding
than foreign alternatives.
   Traders said the index quickly rose as the yen's surge against
the dollar, in addition to overnight gains in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average in New York, reassured participants.

   A reputed member of the Gambino organized crime
family was found slain execution-style in a Manhattan parking
garage, police said.
   The body of Louis DiBono, 63, of Glen Cove was found sprawled
across the front seat of a 1987 Cadillac Thursday afternoon by a
parking attendant at the World Trade Center, said police Sgt. Peter
Berry.
   DiBono had been shot in the head three times, then pushed inside
the car, Berry said. Robbery did not appear to be a motive because
cash was found on the front seat of the car, police said.
   Law enforcement sources, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said DiBono was a ``made man,'' an organized crime term
for a member who is not supposed to be killed without approved by
the family hierarchy.
   The reputed boss of the Gambino crime family is John Gotti. The
gropup allegedly is involved in construction-industry and
garment-industry extortion, Brooklyn and Staten Island waterfront
rackets, narcotics trafficking, and gambling and loan sharking in
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.

   Labor leaders reacted angrily to word that Mayor
David Dinkins is considering laying off at least 15,000 city
workers to help close a budget deficit that could go as high as
$2.6 billion by next year.
   ``The mayor has declared war on the unions in the city,'' said
Barry Feinstein, president of the 23,000-member Teamsters Local
237. ``He has spit in the eye of public employees through this
unilateral action.''
   Stanley Hill, head of the 140,000-strong District Council 37
union, said Dinkins' plans would lead to ``total demoralization,
anger, frustration'' for his members.``The same way I feel,'' he
said.
   Dinkins said his budget advisers predicted that the layoffs and
other agency reductions would save $800 million.
   The last large-scale layoffs in New York came in 1975, when the
city nearly went bankrupt and about 25,000 workers were laid off.
The city has about 240,000 workers.
   While insisting that layoffs were not yet a certainty, Dinkins
took steps Thursday to halt all new hiring, promotions and merit
raises.
   The mayor said the freeze would save $115 million in payroll
costs in the current 1991 fiscal year and the 1992 fiscal year,
which starts July 1.
   ``It's not at all pleasant - needless to say - but, fiscal
stability is essential,'' Dinkins told reporters at City Hall.
   Philip Michael, the mayor's Budget Director, estimated that
revenues in this fiscal year would result in a shortfall of $150
million, and next year's deficit would reach $1.4 billion.
   Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said the budget gap for next year
could go as high as $2.6 billion. She also projected a budget
deficit in the current fiscal year as high as $738 million.
   The mayor cautioned at the news conference that, ``We haven't
done any layoffs yet, nor have we called for any layoffs yet.''
   But Michael said: ``I think layoffs will have to be an essential
part of that solution.''
   The mayor's freeze announcement came two days after he proposed
a $1.8 billion plan to bolster crimefighting citywide, including
hiring nearly 8,000 new police officers.
   He proposed property taxes hikes and a payroll tax to fund the
planned law enforcment expansion.

<HEAD>Woman Sues Landlords of Alleged Haunted House, Wants Cash for
`Ghost Busters'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HEBRON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who claims the 110-year-old house
she once rented is haunted wants her former landlords to pay the
fee charged by two ghost hunters she hired to investigate.
   Jo-Ann Rich, scheduled to appear in Vernon Superior Court today,
is suing Kevin O'Donnell and Hayden Houston, for $2,000. She wants
them to cover the $185 fee she paid to the ghost hunters, as well
as to return a $1,250 security deposit and $500 in rent and
interest.
   Ed and Lorraine Warren of Monroe, who investigated the haunting
at the Long Island, N.Y., house made famous in the book and movie
``The Amityville Horror,'' support Rich's claim that the seven-room
Victorian house is spooked.
   Mrs. Warren, who claims she is clairvoyant, said she felt the
presence of a confused, somewhat frustrated human spirit in the
house. She said she also felt the presence of something evil.
   Rich moved into the house in the fall of 1988 with her boyfriend
and son. She moved out 18 months later, before her lease was up.
O'Donnell and Houston are countersuing her for $2,000 for breaking
the lease.
   Rich said she had no choice but to move out after being
terrorized by ghosts. She cited several inexplicable occurrences,
saying she photographed a pink haze at the top of the stairway and
a blue haze over a mysterious candle that would not burn down.
   O'Donnell has called Rich's claim ``baloney'' and accused her of
conjuring the ghost story to get out of her lease after her
boyfriend moved out and she had trouble paying the rent.
   The house, which was built about 1880, has had at least six
owners. Among them were Edward and Janet Phillips, who lived there
19 years. The Phillips, now retired and living in Plainville, say
they have no recollection of strange incidents.
   The house is now occupied by a state trooper and his family, who
moved there in August. Trooper Mark Dumas said he's heard rumors
about the ghosts but puts no stock in them.

   George Bush went on national television,
enlisted the help of three former presidents and a gravely-ill
Republican national chairman, and got slaughtered.
   The ``Don't Worry-Be Happy'' theme of his presidential campaign
just didn't prepare his Republicans for swallowing painful budget
medicine. He broke his no-new-taxes pledge, but that didn't mean
they were ready to follow.
   ``The politics of the 1980's was `let's pretend,''' said Rep.
Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ``That psychology is deeply embedded in the
politics of America.''
   With the most intensive congressional lobbying effort of his
presidency, Bush only mustered 71 of 176 Republicans to vote for
his $500 billion deficit reduction deal with Congress. Democrats
feared giving Republicans an issue and rebuffed their own leaders
too, and the budget failed 254-179.
   Lawmakers just didn't buy the argument that they had to swallow
tax increases, cuts in Medicare, and other unpopular measures in
order to reduce the deficit. Not five weeks before election day.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Minority Whip who led
Republican opposition, won big and he didn't even get up and speak
during the debate.
   That a deficit plan had to contain entirely bitter medicine was
``a false notion,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who helped
Gingrich. ``It is possible to put together a good plan for the
economy that will pass.''
   ``Why was it (the compromise) put forward and pushed ahead with
such vigor?'' he asked following the lopsided rejection.
   The vote clearly was an embarrassment for House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
neither of whom could summon many loyalty votes from their troops
despite stirring appeals that earned them standing ovations in the
House.
   But it was surely a much more astonishing loss for the
president, who enjoys almost incredible popularity in the polls,
whose one-on-one cajoling ability is credited with arranging the
international blockade of Iraq, and who appealed to the nation on
television to pressure Congress to pass the plan.
   It's difficult to imagine what more he could have done.
   He had groups of GOP lawmakers come to the White House so he
could lobby them face to face. He kept telephone lines all over
town busy, with House members hearing from him even before 7 a.m.
   ``How painful to him to have to ask each of us personally,''
said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., one of the budget negotiators, who
reminded his colleagues during the debate that Bush and his veto
were the House Republicans' only defense against the majority
Democrats.
   The president enlisted the help of the three living former
Republican presidents - Reagan, Ford and, yes, Nixon - to telephone
GOP members and urge them to support the plan.
   ``I guess Jimmy Carter didn't call anybody,'' speculated Rep.
John Myers, R-Ind., one of the normally loyal Republicans whom Bush
couldn't win over on this one.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, who is
battling a brain tumor, sent Republican members a letter warning
that without passage of the budget, ``our hard-won gains could be
wiped out.''
   ``Please do not turn your back on the president,'' Atwater
asked.
   There was evidence that part of Bush's problem was heavy-handed
lobbying by some of his staff.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said Bush called him at 6:45 a.m.
at home, then his chief of staff John Sununu phoned later, ``and he
was a little rough.''
   Sununu also got bad reviews at a House Republican caucus earlier
in the week - not to mention his comment on television that a GOP
senator opposing the plan was ``insignificant.'' Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., didn't like being called insignificant.
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, said the White House took back its
offer of the president's box for a show at the Kennedy Center after
he refused to come around.
   ``There have been better moments,'' he said.

<HEAD>Quadriplegic Found Dead Before State High Court Can Issue
Right-to-Die Ruling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quadriplegic man who didn't want to outlive
his terminally ill father died before the Nevada Supreme Court got
a chance to rule on his request that he be allowed to end his life.
   The Las Vegas Sun reported Thursday that Kenneth Bergstedt's
father, Robert Bergstedt, said his son asked him to help end his
life Wednesday night and that he complied by giving him sedatives
and loosening his respirator tube.
   Police said the father told them he awoke Thursday morning in
the mobil home the two men shared and found his 31-year-old adopted
son dead.
   ``He said the respirator was loosened during the night,'' said
police Lt. Steve Ducharme.
   Kenneth Bergstedt, in court papers filed earlier this year, said
he feared his father would die before he did, leaving him with no
one to care for him. He had been paralyzed frmm the neck down since
a 1969 swimming pool accident.
   District Judge Donald Mosley granted Bergstedt's request to die,
ruling in June that the death would not be considered a suicide and
that anyone who aided him would not face any penalties.
   But Mosley asked Bergstedt not to end his life until the state
Supreme Court could rule on the matter and establish a legal
precedent.
   The high court said it could not issue an immediate ruling
because the case required more research.
   Bergstedt's attorney, Jack Cherry, said if someone did help him
die they could not be prosecuted.
   ``I have a court order saying anyone that helps Kenneth in doing
this is not guilty of a crime,'' Cherry said.
   Police homicide Lt. Kyle Edwards said his office is
investigating the death, but added it would be up to others to
decide if any charges could be filed.
   ``At the present time there is a court order that says this is
not a crime,'' Edwards said. ``This is a legal issue that's going
to go a lot higher than us.''
   The older Bergstedt, an amputee who last month was diagnosed as
suffering from terminal lung cancer, had taken care of his son
since his wife died of lung cancer in 1979.
   He said previously he didn't want to see his son die, but
understood his reasons.
   ``Let's face it. He's been in jail for 21 years, and I've been
his keeper,'' he said.
   In asking a judge in June to allow him to end his life, Kenneth
Bergstedt described his existence as devoid of fulfillment. He said
he spent almost all of his time strapped to a gurney and hooked to
a respirator, passing the hours by watching television or working
with a specially equipped computer.
   Cherry told the state Supreme Court last month that doctors
wouldn't comply with Bergstedt's request to provide him with
sedatives so he could die because they feared civil liability and
possible criminal charges.

<HEAD>Hatfield Aide Suspends Column</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top aide to Sen. Mark Hatfield has
suspended his weekly newspaper column after Hatfield's challenger
questioned columns that mentioned contributors to the Republican
senator's re-election campaign.
   Representatives of Democratic Senate candidate Harry Lonsdale
criticized Gerry Frank for mentioning Hatfield campaign
contributors four times in the past 16 months in Frank's weekly
column in The Oregonian.
   Frank, chief of staff for Republican Hatfield, said there is no
connection between the columns and the contributions.
   He described the criticism from the Lonsdale camp as an
``illegitimate campaign issue'' but decided to suspend the column
to avoid further controversy.
   Judson Randall, assistant to Editor William A. Hilliard, said
that The Oregonian endorsed Frank's decision to suspend the column,
but would have kept running had Frank desired.

<HEAD>State Sues Republican Senatorial Committee On Consumer Fraud
Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials sued the National
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, charging that a GOP
fund-raising letter is deceptive and may defraud the public.
   The suit, filed Thursday by Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo
and Director of Consumer Affairs Patricia Royer, asks for a court
hearing on the committee's mailing of $25 checks to residents. If a
person endorses the check and provides a bank account number, the
Republican committee is authorized to automatically withdraw $12.50
a month from that person's bank account.
   ``In 20 years of experience with consumer fraud, I have never
before seen this type of fraudulent action,'' said Ms. Royer. ``I
am very concerned that every con artist out there will use
automatic funds transfer as a way to defraud the public. Let this
quick action serve as a warning that this behavior will not be
tolerated in New Jersey.'' The suit was filed in state Superior
Court in Essex County. It seeks fines, costs and restitution of any
money collected.
   Ms. Royer said the terms of the agreement that would allow the
Republican committee to withdraw $12.50 a month from residents'
bank accounts are printed on the reverse side of the check.
   ``But the print is so small a person with 20-20 vision would
have a problem reading it without the aid of a magnifier,'' she
said.
   National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman
Wendy Burnley sharply denied that the fund-raising letter was
improper, suggesting that complaints against it may be politically
motivated. Ms. Burnley acknowledged that the letter has prompted
complaints in at least six states. In addition to New Jersey,
Illinois and Alabama have filed suit against the committee, Ms.
Burnley said. The attorneys general of Oregon, Minnesota and
Michigan also have complained, she said. The letters were sent to 1
million people nationwide, Ms. Burnley said.

<HEAD>Republicans Lose Bid To Be Dropped From Democratic Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House aide Ronald Kaufman and
another Republican lost their bids to be dropped from a lawsuit
charging the Springfield police union conspired to disrupt the
Democratic state convention last June.
   In a ruling issued Thursday in Hampden County Superior Court,
Judge William W. Simons refused to dismiss claims by the state
Democratic Committee in its suit against Kaufman and Stephen
DeAngelis, a one-time campaign operative for Joseph Malone, a GOP
candidate for state treasurer.
   The suit charges that Kaufman and DeAngelis worked with the
police union in its picketing of the convention, which delayed the
proceedings for four hours and was politically embarrassing for the
Democrats.
   Simons also ruled that police pickets at the convention had
verbally and physically assaulted some persons outside the
convention hall.
   Simons said the Democrats, including five convention delegates,
had presented enough facts to support their claims against Kaufman,
the Union-News of Springfield reported.
   The judge also said there is enough of a ``factual dispute''
over DeAngelis' involvement in the convention disruption to allow
the case against him to continue.
   The judge said the Democrats ``state facts which support their
allegations'' about Kaufman and ``allege with specificity that
Kaufman met with, planned and assisted the picketing by the police
union.''
   Kaufman is a deputy assistant to President George Bush.
   The police union and its president, Patrolman Robert Jacobson,
also are defendants in the suit.
   The suit includes allegations that the police union violated
delegates' civil rights by keeping them from the convention June 2.

   A 2,000-pound Brahman bull snapped its
halter rope and got loose at the Mississippi State Fair, sending
frightened fairgoers running for cover while a band of would-be
matadors gave chase.
   The bull belonging to the breed used in rodeo riding events took
an impromptu tour of the fairgrounds Thursday, dumping a man from
his wheelchair and trampling a firefighter who tried to help.
   ``I looked up and saw a lot of scary looks like there was a gang
fight,'' said Johnny Minninger, 32, of Madison. ``All of a sudden,
a bull came out of the crowd with about 50 people chasing it.''
   Fire Lt. Rudy Brooks tangled with the bull, which knocked him
into a trailer ``and under it.''
   ``You can see the prints on the back of my shirt,'' Brooks
said.``I had him around the head trying to keep from getting my
insides squashed out.''
   Harold Roosa III, 27, of Kansas City, Mo., an employee of the
carnival company Bluegrass Shows, said the bull took off ``straight
out toward and directly pass the front gate, made his way to Kiddy
Land, past the circus and cut across the midway.''
   As he sped past the circus, the bull belted a man in a
wheelchair, Roosa said. People in the crowd helped the man, who was
uninjured, back into his wheelchair and he promptly rolled off
after the bull.
   The crowd steered the bull past a concession stand and into the
livestock judging arena, where he was corralled with a makeshift
cage.
   ``We brought in another bull and a heifer to tame him down,''
Brooks said.
   Hinds County Undersheriff J.W. Stevens said officials did not
know the identity of the bull's owner.

   A fraternity party that featured a skit
describing the ``perfect female sex organs'' sparked a rally at
which hundreds protested, including a campus doctor wearing a sign
that said ``Castrate Sigma Chi.''
   An estimated 200 to 300 men and women chanted and waved placards
outside the University of New Mexico's Sigma Chi chapter Thursday,
condemning the party as a promotion of violence against women and a
violation of women's rights.
   The university suspended the Sigma Chi chapter following its
annual ``Mafia Wedding'' party on Saturday night. A party skit
included a poem describing seven wise men's creation of the perfect
female sex organs.
   At one point, male partygoers were encouraged to grab their
loins and shout, ``Feel the power,'' according to an account
carried in the campus newspaper, The Daily Lobo.
   ``Things that have been overlooked before, things that have been
OK before, boys-will-be-boys things, are not OK anymore if they
ever were,'' UNM Associate Academic Affairs Vice President Jan
Roebuck told the crowd over a loudspeaker Thursday.
   Juba Clayton, director of the UNM Women's Center, led the crowd
in chanting: ``Sigma Chi, stop it. You are hurting me. You are
raping me. We will not stand for it. It is not funny. Violence
against women is not funny.''
   Amy Llewellyn, a resident physician in pathology at UNM Medical
Center, wore a bumper sticker on her back that said: ``FEEL THE
POWER! CASTRATE SIGMA CHI.'' She said later in a telephone
interview that the message was meant to be taken figuratively.
   ``Certainly we weren't insinuating any literal interpretation of
that,'' she said.
   She added that the party skit ``reflects a misogynistic attitude
that you would not expect in gentlemen going to college.''
   Chapter alumnus Ross Burkstaller, 24, a senior psychology major,
acknowledged that he read the poem at the party.
   ``All I can say is what got out is inappropriate, inexcusable
and ignorant, and myself and the others are sorry that it happened
and that it offended the women present and the women that heard
about it through the media,'' Burkstaller said.
   Sigma Chi President Dan Holton said the fraternity delivered
letters of apology to each sorority on campus, and some fraternity
members apologized in person.
   No Sigma Chi activities other than formal chapter meetings may
take place during the suspension and pending administrative review
of the incident, said Dean of Students Karen Glaser.
   The ``Mafia Wedding'' party has been a regular event on the
Sigma Chi social calendar since the release of ``The Godfather''
movie in the early 1970s.

<HEAD>Roseanne Barr, Husband File $35 Million Racketeering Suit Against
Tabloids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Roseanne Barr and her husband have
filed a $35 million federal racketeering lawsuit against the
National Enquirer and Star tabloids over their publication of her
love letters.
   The suit was filed Thursday under federal racketeering statutes
charging copyright infringement, conspiracy, invasion of property
and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
   The U.S. District Court suit seeks $10 million compensatory
damages and $25 million punitive damages from the National
Enquirer, Star and the publications' owner, News America Publishing
Inc.
   Last week, Elizabeth Taylor filed a $20 million libel suit in
Los Angeles Superior Court against the National Enquirer for
alleged false statements.
   But Miss Barr and husband Tom Arnold are seeking relief under
the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
known as RICO.
   The couple's lawyer, Theresa M. Marchlewski, declined comment
Thursday.
   The racketeering activity, according to the suit, involves the
Enquirer's alleged ``participation in a scheme to obtain the
private papers and effects of celebrities by inducing and paying
persons and entities to steal such information and transport it in
interstate commerce.''
   The couple also seeks the return of Miss Barr's ``private,
written letters and outpourings of love and affection to Arnold
embodied in four writings ... purloined and-or published by
defendants.''
   Excerpts of the letters were published in the Feb. 6, 1990,
issue of the Enquirer and the Jan. 30, 1990, edition of the Star,
the suit said.
   Exhibits submitted with the suit included copies of a National
Enquirer cover headline reading, ``Roseanne Wedding Fiasco - Plus
Amazing Honeymoon Swimsuit Photos.''
   National Enquirer editor Iain Calder said from his Lantana,
Fla., office that he hadn't seen the suit so he couldn't respond to
specific allegations.
   ``Any legal action against this publication under RICO is so
ridiculous that it is clear this is just another pathetic publicity
stunt by Roseanne,'' Calder said.
   ``She is trashing the National Enquirer, but we are in good
company. A few weeks ago she was trashing the national anthem.''
   Star editor Dick Kaplan said from Tarrytown, N.Y., that he would
have no comment because he hadn't seen the suit.
   ``The lawsuit speaks for itself,'' Miss Barr and Arnold said in
a statement released by spokeswoman Cathy Spears.
   Miss Spears said the couple feels the case should be tried in
court and not in the media. ``According to Barr and Arnold, they
have suffered grievous injury and will look to the courts to decide
the issues involved,'' she said.
   The suit said the tabloids operate ``a vast network of
underground operatives and includes, but is not limited to, agents,
employees, friends, relatives and associates of celebrities as well
as persons and entities who provide goods and services to
celebrities, including plaintiffs.''
   Every member of the tabloids' alleged underground enterprise
``conspired with each other to commit the multiple violations of
RICO,'' the suit said.

   Rain fell along the North Carolina coastline early today, and in
the Pacific Northwest.
   Skies were mostly clear in the nation's mid-section, with
touches of fog across the Appalachians.
   Skies were cloudy along the West Coast, and rain fell in
Portland, Ore., Seattle and Spokane, Wash.
   Today's forecast called for the first snow of the season in the
mountains of western and central Montana, with 4 to 6 inches
accumulated by Saturday.
   Temperatures were likely to soar into the 90s from the Gulf
coast to North Dakota in the Plains, and across the Deep South.
That would be 15 to 25 degrees hotter than normal.
   The Midwest, mid-Mississippi Valley and lower altitudes of the
central and lower Rockies were expected to have temperatures in the
80s.
   Colder weather was pushing behind a cold front that stretched
from northern Nevada and Idaho, into Montana.
   Showers could develop along the Gulf Coast from Texas to
northern Florida.
   The nation's high on Thursday was 104 degrees at Borrego

<TEXT>
   Old Sweats, British army slang for seasoned
soldiers, has taken on new meaning for Britain's soldiers sent to
join the multinational force in the Persian Gulf.
   While the Britons swelter in army uniforms designed for cooler
climes, the Iraqis weather the heat in special desert uniforms that
Britain sold them four years ago.
   The Defense Ministry said Thursday that in 1986, it sold its
entire stock of desert uniforms to the Iraqis, thinking that with
Britain's reduced defense commitments around the world they would
no longer be needed.
   As a result, most of the 9,000 British soldiers who began
arriving in the gulf last week must wear their European camouflage
uniforms while they await the arrival of new lightweight clothing.
   A ministry spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
keeping with standing rules, said the uniforms sold to the Iraqis
in 1986 date from the 1960s, when British troops were in Aden.
   ``The uniforms were sold as a normal turnover of stock. The
present deployment of forces to the gulf was unforeseen,'' she
said. ``It would not have been economic for the army to hold that
amount of desert uniforms in stores on a constant basis.
   She said new lightweight cotton uniforms will be shipped to the
British troops soon.

   An anti-Semitic quote in an independent
Dartmouth College paper known for its strong criticisms of
minorities has infuriated people on and off campus who say they
won't stand for further such incidents.
   But trustees and staffers of The Dartmouth Review insist a
saboteur placed the Adolf Hitler quote in the publication, and they
have apologized. They further claimed that university President
James Freedman and others have created ``a lynch-mob'' mentality on
campus.
   About 2,000 people attended a rally Thursday to denounce the
quote and the paper. History Professor Bruce Nelson told the crowd
the Review ``lacks a shred of intellectual integrity'' and that the
quote is the latest example of the ``small-minded, mean-spirited
scribblings of the local hate sheet.''
   Freedman called the quote an ``egregious expression of
anti-Semitism.''
   ``For the last 10 years, these shameless voices have ranted that
Dartmouth is for some but not for others,'' he said. ``These voices
have preached exclusion from the Dartmouth family and have expected
us to heed their words. What kind of people did they think we
were?''
   Even congressmen have responded. On Thursday, 84 representatives
signed a letter from Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., to Freedman
denouncing the quote.
   ``Recent inclusion of virulent anti-Semitic remarks has made the
Review worthy of condemnation by all those in this nation who are
repulsed by wanton expressions of hatred, injustice and cruelty,''
the letter said.
   Staffers and trustees at the Review say they've suffered
unjustly for an act by someone determined to discredit the paper.
   Trustee Dinesh D'Souza said students at the paper have received
death threats, and he strongly criticized Freedman and others for
not helping the paper find the perpetrator.
   ``Unfortunately, Dartmouth officials to date have shown no
interest in uncovering what happened, and indeed convened a
lynch-mob to make scapegoats of innocent students,'' D'Souza said.
``In a total abdication of their leadership and responsibility,
college officials are manipulating the grave issue of anti-Semitism
for ends of self-aggrandizement and expediency.''
   The Review, published since 1980, has been vilified through the
years for its views on women, homosexuals, blacks and Indians.
   William Cole, a black music professor, resigned in August after
the Review attacked him for seven years in print, belittling him as
a mediocre teacher. Cole said the attacks compromised his
effectiveness.
   Review staffers also were involved in a 1986 sledgehammer attack
on shanties erected on the campus green as part of a protest
against segregation in South Africa. Several staffers were
suspended.
   The latest edition of the Review was distributed Saturday, on
Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and Judaism's most solemn
day. The quotation, from Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' was inserted
unattributed into the statement of principles on the Review's
masthead:
   ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the sense of
the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am fighting for
the Lord's work.''
   Backlash from the quote caused the Review's president and two
staffers to quit earlier in the week.
   The anti-Semitic quote was not the first time the paper has
angered Jews. In 1988, The Review ran a column likening Freedman -
who's Jewish - to Hitler and the effects of his campus policies to
the Holocaust.
   D'Souza said the 1988 column was ``sophomoric and in bad
taste.'' He said trustees apologized for it at the time.
   Dartmouth religion Professor Arthur Hertzberg, vice president of
the World Jewish Congress, called the latest controversy ``an act
of hooliganism'' and attacked the Review's supporters, including
syndicated columnists Patrick Buchanan and William F. Buckley and
the New York-based John M. Olin Foundation.
   ``My quarrel is with those who put up hundreds of thousands of
dollars with which to contaminate this campus,'' he said.
   D'Souza suggested the quote was ``surgically implanted.'' He
pointed to an apostrophe in the quote that's different from the
type used by paper, suggesting it was typed by someone unfamiliar
with the paper or added by an outsider.
   Editor in Chief Kevin Pritchett, who also has taken over as
president, said he ``should have been more vigilant. I will do
everything in my power to find the person who did this.''
   Pritchett said that if anything, the paper is pro-Israel. He
also said editors don't check the paper's masthead daily, so it was
easy to miss the quote, which appeared within the context of the
Review's normal credo, a quote from Theodore Roosevelt.

   Hundreds of people angry over alleged police
corruption built barricades and set them on fire today in front of
1,000 riot police, who were deployed to try to stop street fighting
in a rundown neighborhood.
   At least 106 people, including 83 police, have been injured in
the violence in the Nishinari district of Osaka that began Tuesday,
police reported. Forty-one people have been arrested.
   The people who live in the crime-ridden district have
long-standing grudges against police, and accusations made public
Tuesday that a local policeman took a bribe from a gangster helped
trigger the rioting.
   But authorities and residents said young hooligans from outside
the district and leftist extremists had agitated to keep the
disturbances going.
   The scope of the violence is extremely rare for Japan, where
issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree.
   About 1,000 riot police lined main roads in Nishinari and the
district police station tonight. A growing crowd of hundreds faced
off against the police lines. They formed barricades by burning
piles of bicycles in streets already littered with burned cars and
other debris.
   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
another 10,000 riot police were on alert in Osaka, Japan's No. 2
city, to prevent another night of rioting. About 100 undercover
police also were mobilized.
   Police reported two stores were set ablaze by rioters early
today, and a train station also was damaged by fire.
   The rioting caused traffic tie-ups in parts of Osaka as police
blocked off several major streets and some rail service was
disrupted. Many Nishinari merchants closed their shops.
   Outside the police station, a group of group shouted insults at
the police from a loudspeaker and demanded an apology for the
purported bribery.
   ``Dogs of gangsters, come out, kneel down before us and
apologize!'' a man screamed through the loudspeaker. ``Don't you
know how much hardship our daily laborers are going through? Why
don't you try working at a construction site one day and you will
probably realize how much we are abused by this society.''
   The chief of the Osaka police headquarters, Masahiro
Tsubakihara, issued an apology Thursday in response to reports that
an officer was involved in scandal, Kyodo News Service reported.
The accused sergeant was arrested Wednesday night, a day after news
reports said he took $22,000 in bribes from a local gangster for
information on police operations.
   The district is a high-crime area and is known for its gangs,
transient laborers and shabby hotels. Locals say there have been
bad feelings between area residents and police, who have adopted
hard-line tactics to battle crime, including a 24-hour surveillance
camera system on street corners.

   Prosecution efforts to force Marlon
Brando's daughter back to the United State from Tahiti to testify
in her brother's murder trial got a boost when a judge agreed to
delay the trial.
   But the endeavor was thwarted at a second hearing Thursday when
another judge refused to order Cheyenne Brando's return, saying he
lacked the legal right to force her return.
   ``My personal view is that any American citizen who witnesses a
crime should be made available to testify,'' Superior Court Judge
Joel Rudof said Thursday. ``But my personal opinion aside, the
question is whether there is legal authority.''
   In one of her conflicting statements to authorities, Miss Brando
said she was present during the May 16 shooting of her 26-year-old
boyfriend, Dag Drollet.
   Christian Brando, 31, charged with murdering Drollet and free on
$2 million bail, attended the first hearing Thursday in which a
judge agreed to postpone the trial, which had been scheduled to
start next week.
   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas gave
prosecutors more time to go forward with legal motions designed to
obtain Miss Brando's testimony.
   He set a tentative date of Nov. 5, but said that date could also
be changed if witnesses are unable to readjust their schedules.
   Miss Brando, 20, has been in a sanitarium in Tahiti since June,
when she gave birth to Drollet's child.
   To complicate matters, Drollet's parents have charged her under
French law with complicity in her boyfriend's slaying. She was
being held in Tahiti by French authorities because of that charge
and lacks permission to leave even if she decided to come
voluntarily.
   Prosecutors said they are not giving up on her return and might
go back to federal court where they were earlier rebuffed on a
similar request.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop said if all efforts to
gain Miss Brando's testimony fail by November, he would go ahead
with trial, presenting other witnesses.
   The judge explained that the law did not allow him to issue a
letter of rogatory, an international document which the prosecution
sought to use as a vehicle to compel Miss Brando's return from
Tahiti.
   ``It seems to me this should be dealt with by the Legislature,''
Rudof said, noting that a state court cannot issue such a letter
although a federal court can.
   Outside court, Richard Hirsch, a lawyer representing Miss
Brando, said that prosecutors had tried to use a novel view of a
law normally invoked only as a communications tool between
governments.
   He said the letter of rogatory has never been used in a criminal
case and was not the proper procedure for compelling Miss Brando's
return.
   Brando's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, vehemently opposed the
delay, insisting that the trial should go forward as quickly as
possible.
   He said Miss Brando was mentally unstable and wouldn't be a
credible witness even if she returned from Tahiti and agreed to
testify.
   Shapiro told the judge that Miss Brando has given five
conflicting statements to authorities about the slaying at the
actor's hilltop estate.
   Marlon Brando, who didn't appear for the brief court hearing
Thursday, suggested last week that his daughter was being unfairly
hounded by prosecutors and was too sick to testify.

   A small earthquake centered 6 miles
north of here jolted large numbers of residents awake, but caused
no injuries or damage, authorities said.
   The quake, which struck at 11:08 p.m. Thursday, measured 3.2 on
the Richter scale of ground motion, said Rick Lester of the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   ``We received lots of calls from people who said it woke them
up,'' said Denise Franklin, a reporter with the Santa Cruz
Sentinel. ``It was two sharp jolts and a boom sound.''
   Authorities also received ``quite a few calls'' but no reports
of injuries or destruction, said a county sheriff's dispatcher who
declined to give her name.
   The northern California earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989, measured
7.1 on the Richter scale and killed 67 people.
   The scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to ground
motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one digit
represents a tenfold increase of magnitude.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, once steadfast allies, will put their political dispute
to the voters in the country's first direct presidential election.
   Ending weeks of doubt about his intentions, Mazowiecki declared
Thursday that he will oppose Walesa, his former mentor, in the
election on Nov. 25. They are vying to succeed former Communist
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Walesa announced his candidacy Sept. 16. Since then, he has
lined up the endorsement of the Solidarity trade union - which he
leads - several small center-right Christian-Democratic parties and
his own Center Alliance party.
   Mazowiecki is supported by a new party, Citizens Movement for
Democratic Action, and much of the intellectual elite that once
belonged to Solidarity.
   As the East bloc's first non-Communist prime minister,
Mazowiecki introduced the region's most radical economic reform
plan in January. He has taken a step-by-step approach to
dismantling other aspects of the old regime.
   Walesa, who sponsored Mazowiecki for prime minister, has accused
him of moving too slowly.
   Mazowiecki said Thursday he will run for president because
Poland should not stray from the course it has set.
   As prime minister, Mazowiecki is responsible for running the
government, and he is answerable to parliament. The presidency, the
government's highest position, controls the army and foreign
affairs.
   ``One has to go forward in a better, faster and more sure way -
but along this path, not a different one,'' Mazowiecki told a
national television audience Thursday as he made his announcement.
   ``Poland, which has a great chance in today's world and in
Europe, should take the place which is due to it - of a wise
country, based on Christian values, of a country of people who are
tolerant toward each other, a country that coexists well with all
its neighbors,'' he said.
   Early opinion surveys indicated Mazowiecki has more support than
Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, but Walesa appeared to
be gaining ground in recent weeks.
   Mazowiecki, 63, a journalist and former political prisoner,
became prime minister on Aug. 24, 1989. Walesa had engineered the
Solidarity takeover of power after the Communists failed to win
sufficient support to govern in partially free elections that June.
   For most of the 1980s, Mazowiecki was an adviser to Walesa. But
last spring, Walesa began publicly accusing the Solidarity-led
government of moving too slowly to privatize the state-dominated
economy and to remove former Communists from influential positions
in the government and economy.
   Walesa urged new presidential and parliamentary elections and
raised a general call for ``acceleration.'' He said he would not
rest until Poland's democratic revolution was completed.
   Supporters of Mazowiecki accused Walesa of demagoguery and
personal ambition. They argued that Mazowiecki's choice of a slow,
consistent path to reform is needed to avoid divisive witchhunts.
   The presidential office becomes vacant because Jaruzelski last
month asked parliament to shorten his six-year term after 17
months.
   There had been growing public demands - instigated by Walesa's
supporters - for a popularly elected president and the removal of
Jaruzelski as a symbol of the old system.
   As Poland's leader in 1981, Jaruzelski ordered martial law to
crush Solidarity, but he then allowed its historic ascension to
power last year.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress,
at odds with white businessmen over the country's economic future,
has toned down its Socialist policies but still wants to see some
industries nationalized.
   The country's leading black opposition movement released an
economic policy document today saying that if it comes to power a
top priority would be redistributing wealth through affirmative
action programs favoring blacks.
   The ANC says it envisions a mixed economy, ``but does not
believe that market forces alone will result in anything but the
perpetuation of existing disparities of income.''
   Whites account for only 5 million of the country's estimated 40
million people but dominate the economy. Blacks have an annual per
capita income of more than $1,000, one of the highest in Africa,
but only a small fraction of white incomes in the country.
   ``South Africa now has one of the most unequal patterns of
distribution of income and wealth in the world,'' the ANC said.
   South Africa's economy, the most powerful on the continent,
currently is in a mild recession and has suffered double-digit
inflation since the early 1980s.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government and white businessmen argue
that socialist-oriented policies will produce economic stagnation
in South Africa similar to that in Eastern Europe.
   They say capitalism is the quickest way to raise black living
standards.
   But the ANC, led by Nelson Mandela, says the government must
intervene to reduce the gulf between white wealth and black
poverty.
   When Mandela was released in February after 27 years in prison
for plotting against the government, he said the ANC wanted to
nationalize gold mines, banks and other leading industries.
   But the 18-page document released today refrained from specific
calls to nationalize major industries.
   It did say, however, that there might be cases for the
``compulsory establishment of new public enterprises.''
   The ANC also said it was ``staunchly opposed to current
government plans to privatize the public utility corporations.''
The ANC said it would seek to nationalize utilities that are sold
off.
   The ANC acknowledged that ``private enterprise has a major role
to play in the economy of a democratic, non-racial South Africa.''
   The government over decades has built up a huge bureaucracy, in
part to provide jobs for whites. About one in three economically
active whites works for the government.
   But de Klerk has begun to sell off large state industries,
saying they will be more efficiently run as private companies.
   Many blacks see the move as an effort to keep the economy in the
hands of whites now that there is the prospect of a black
government in the not-too-distant future.
   De Klerk says he wants to end the apartheid system of racial
segregation and draw up a new constitution that will allow whites
and blacks to share power.
   Debate on the future of the economy has been almost as heated as
discussion about a political settlement.
   The government has been running television commercials and
placing billboards in black areas saying that capitalism is crucial
to economic prosperity. Businessmen have called for government
deregulation and increased business opportunites for both whites
and blacks.
   But many black anti-apartheid groups, and black trade unions
remain strong advocates of socialism. The South African Communist
Party, closely allied to the ANC, also is committed to socialism.

   The latest photographs from the crippled Hubble
Space Telescope have lifted much of the gloom that descended on
scientists after a focusing flaw was discovered last summer.
   At the same time, astronomers acknowledge that one of the $1.5
billion space observatory's prime missions - peering out into the
farthest reaches of space - can not be undertaken until the flaw is
corrected.
   When the space telescope was put into orbit 381 miles above the
Earth by the space shuttle on April 25, scientists were excited by
the prospect of measuring the speed with which the outermost edges
of the universe are expanding. Now that work will have to postponed
three or four years.
   ``First of all, the problem with the optics are there, and they
will have to be fixed. That is certainly true,'' said Riccardo
Giacconi, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute.
``However, the other thing that emerged (as a result of the
photographs) is that some of the basic capacity ... has been
preserved.
   ``We can use that optical power but only for sources that are
not too far away, that are bright enough.''
   In practice, that means astronomers will have to reorder their
priorities, and the institute is currently re-evaluating 160
research projects originally planned for the Hubble, Giacconi said.
   With computer enhancement, studies of relatively nearby objects
and phenomena, including novas, will be possible with the same
degree of accuracy as originally envisioned, he said.
   One photo presented Thursday by the science institute offered
the clearest view yet of enigmatic Pluto, the ninth and only planet
that hasn't been visited by a fly-by spacecraft, and its moon
Charon. There also was a shot of startling clarity of Saturn.
   Scientists said that some photographs from Hubble had 10 times
the resolution that would have been possible from earthbound
telescopes.
   The mood at the institute Thursday was much improved from last
summer when it was discovered that a mirror on the telescope had
manufacturing problems. The observatory's initial pictures were
blurred and of severely limited value to astronomers.
   Scientists are currently weighing how best to repair flaws in
the telescope's mirrors. A replacement wide-field camera is now
being built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and
plans call for it to be delivered to Hubble on a space shuttle
flight in 1993.
   Engineers plan to install correcting optics in the replacement
camera to compensate for the flawed mirrors.
   Within the next few weeks, the Hubble's spectrographic
instruments are expected to begin transmitting data back to earth
on temperature, motion and composition of stars. Results from these
studies are usually expressed in numbers and graphs, not pictures.

<TEXT>
   Louisiana's U.S. Senate race has become a
head-to-head match between nn incumbent Democrat reluctantly
supported by Republican party leaders over a Republican who was
once a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
   State Sen. Ben Bagert dropped out of the primary race Thursday,
saying he feared his Republican candidacy could force incumbent
Democrat J. Bennett Johnston into a runoff with ex-Klansman and
Republican state Rep. David Duke. Under Louisiana's open primary
system, all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party
affiliation. A runoff between the top two finishers is held if no
one receives a majority of votes.
   Bagert said his polls indicated he might pull just enough votes
to keep Johnston from getting more than 50 percent of the vote and
force the three-term incumbent into a runoff with Duke.
   GOP leaders say such an event would embarrass the state and the
Republican party nationally. Eight Republican senators endorsed
Johnston earlier this week.
   ``I'm not endorsing anybody, but I'm not voting for David
Duke,'' Bagert said. Asked if he would vote for Johnston, he said,
``Yes, reluctantly.''
   Bagert's staff said he would file papers today with the
secretary of state's office to formally withdraw from the election.
   It's too late to get his name off the ballot. But if he
officially withdraws before 6 a.m. Saturday, any votes cast for him
will not be counted, Secretary of State Fox McKeithen said
Thursday.
   Polls show that move should greatly enhance Johnston's chances
of garnering 50 percent and staving off a runoff.
   A poll released Wednesday by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research of
Columbia, Md., showed Johnston was the choice of 53 percent of
voters surveyed. Duke drew 26 percent, while Bagert polled 8
percent, with 13 percent undecided. The poll of 825 registered
voters had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
   Johnston refused to predict that Bagert's move would assure him
victory in Saturday's election and added he was making sure now
that his supporters do not become complacent.
   ``All my supporters understand how important this race is,''
Johnston said. ``The state's on trial. The state has a chance to
show what it is, what its values are, to the rest of the country.
   Duke scoffed at the idea that Bagert's conservative Republican
support might move to Johnston's camp.
   ``They sure don't want a liberal senator to go back there and
vote for more taxes and for affirmative action,'' he said in a
television interview.
   Johnston has often voted a moderate-to-conservative line in
Washington, supporting defense spending and aid to the Nicaraguan
contras.
   But Duke and Bagert have accused him of being too liberal for
Louisiana, citing his role in helping defeat former President
Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court and
his support for the Civil Rights Act of 1990.
   Meanwhile, Duke has said his days as a Klansman and neo-Nazi are
behind him, but critics say they don't believe him. They point to
his selling of Nazi literature from his suburban New Orleans
office, a practice he stopped in 1989 after Republican leaders
reported it to the media.
   Duke ran for president in 1988, first as a Democrat, later as a
populist. He ran for the state Legislature as a Republican in 1989
and won a narrow victory over another Republican in an all-white
suburban New Orleans district.

   Some foreign workers have chosen to
remain in Iraq since the Persian Gulf crisis began, but others,
such as Portugese stone masons and Soviet oilmen, have been held to
avoid further damage to Iraq's economy.
   More than 500,000 foreign workers have been stranded in Iraq
since it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the United States and other
countries responded by massing troops in the gulf region to deter
possible further aggression.
   The Iraqis hold 2,200 Westerners in Kuwait and Iraq, some at
strategic installations to discourage an attack by the U.S.-led
military forces.
   Some foreign workers have stayed willingly - preferring the
certainty of a paycheck to unknown job prospects at home, diplomats
said.
   But the diplomats, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity,
said many other workers who want to leave have found most avenues
blocked by bureaucracy.
   Iraq, suffering the effects of the U.N.-imposed economic
sanctions, has kept many workers in the country to keep the economy
running, even diverting some to areas in need of a boost, such as
agriculture, the diplomats said.
   About 4,500 Soviet oil industry workers are in Iraq, and a
foreign source in Baghdad said the Iraqis are dependent on them.
   ``If they go, no one else will come in to operate these
fields,'' the source said.
   Polish work crews building roads, pipelines and railroads also
are helping Iraq's industries and projects limp along. Many Iraqi
construction projects were halted when the U.N. economic embargo
cut off imports.
   The stranded foreigners also include 25 Portuguese stone masons
who last month completed marble work on a palace for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, the Portugese Foreign Ministry in Lisbon
said.
   Officials disagree over whether such work violates the U.N.
embargo and the responsibilities of the foreign workers.
   ``As far as I understand, working there would violate the
sanctions,'' Swedish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lars-Olof Lundberg
said Wednesday.
   The British government is more flexible.
   ``Like many governments, we have concluded that it is
unreasonable to ask people who are essentially working under duress
to stop working and put themselves at risk,'' a Foreign Office
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   U.N. directives regarding the sanctions are ``open to
interpretation,'' a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.
   She said the status of a dredging project in southern Iraq,
employing 104 Dutch citizens, is unclear but there is speculation
the dredgers are being forced to work.
   Officials said many Bangladeshis, Egyptians, Indians, Pakistanis
and Sri Lankans are being kept at their old jobs. Also, about 2,000
Bangladeshis are working as ``forced labor'' in Iraqi military
camps in Kuwait, a Foreign Ministry official in Dhaka said this
week.
   Iraq is trying to grow more crops because of the trade embargo,
and some Third World laborers who were working on canceled projects
have been diverted to agriculture, a source in Baghdad said.
   Agriculture Minister Abdul Wahab Mahmoud said in a report
published Thursday that Iraqi farmers must redouble their efforts
to grow more grain.
   The Iraqis are slow about giving exit visas, delaying but not
preventing some workers from leaving, a European diplomat said this
week.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh told
reporters Tuesday that Iraq has been slow responding to requests to
allow the oil workers to leave.
   ``Regrettably, the Iraqi authorities clearly show tardiness in
considering the documents submitted by the Soviet side,'' he said.
   But some workers have managed to leave after weeks of pleas and
paperwork.
   A plane carrying 173 Brazilians, mainly weapons technicians and
idled construction workers, left Baghdad on Wednesday after appeals
and visits by high-ranking Brazilian officials. Eighty-two
Brazilians remain in Iraq.
   Several hundred Bulgarians are stranded in Iraq as well as 66
Czechs, about half of whom are working on an irrigation project,
officials said.
   Of nearly 10,000 Yugoslavs working in construction prior to the
gulf crisis, less than 200 remain and are reportedly working on a
hydroelectric project.
   About 5,000 Chinese are also in Iraq, mostly construction
workers under state-arranged contracts.

   Doctors who hoped to test a French abortion
pill must now convince its manufacturer, which called off testing
because of public outcry against the drug.
   State health authorities have indicated willingness to approve a
test program for RU-486 at the University of California at San
Francisco. But it needs further information from the manufacturer,
Roussel-Uclaf. And the researchers need to have the drug itself.
   RU-486 is not approved for general sale in the United States.
   In February, Roussel-Uclaf stopped providing RU-486 to the
University of California at Los Angeles for tests there.
   The French company explained the move by saying an abortion pill
is too controversial for America.
   ``We think public and political opinion in the states is not
ready to accept either abortion or 486,'' said Ariel Mouttet, the
international products manager for Roussel-Uclaf. ``We will resume
testing it in the States when the debate and the climate on
abortion has been resolved.''
   The drug is taken in the first seven weeks of pregnancy under a
doctor's supervision. It prevents fertilized eggs from implanting
in the uterus.
   Dr. Marcus Conant, heading the group that wants to test the drug
here, said its program would administer RU-486 with the hormone
prostaglandin, which causes uterine contractions and reduces the
risk of hemorrhaging. Tests at UCLA did not include prostaglandin.
   Conant said state regulators have ``told us our application
looks really good.''
   ``They have indicated a willingness to approve our testing
protocol for RU 486, but they need information that only the
(French) company can provide,'' Conant said. ``And we need access
to the drug.''
   Testing of RU-486 has backing from such groups as Planned
Parenthood and the American Medical Association. Anti-abortion
groups oppose it. They have threatened to boycott the products of
Roussel-Uclaf if RU-486 becomes available in the United States.
   Conant and San Francisco epidemiologist Steve Heilig said they
hope to meet with Roussel-Uclaf representatives by early next year
to urge them to allow testing to continue.
   ``We think we have a chance to convince them because they're
finally moving the drug into Britain and Scandinavia,'' Heilig
said. ``We've had some meetings with them in France and we're
making some progress.''
   RU-486 was approved in France in 1988. Roussel-Uclaf says it has
been used with 96 percent success by more than 55,000 women.

   One of three Britons who made a daring escape from
Iraq by boat said today other expatriates shouldn't try to escape
the same way because it is too risky.
   Speaking to reporters upon their arrival at London's Heathrow
Airport, Keith Barkworth, 36; Mike Teesdale, 40; and Ivan Manning,
44, said many Westerners in Iraq were plotting escapes.
   While Barkworth said he wouldn't recommend his own escape rout
to others because it was ``too risky,'' Teesdale said he had tried
it because, ``I have got a wife and two children and thought I had
outstayed my welcome in Iraq.''
   The Britons escaped with two Frenchmen, Amedee du Paty, 53, and
Janel Cellier de Buriane, 55.
   The five men bobbed for 25 hours in a 10-foot boat in rough seas
before being rescued off the Saudi Arabian coast near Khafji.
   It was the first report of Western men escaping from Iraq in
over six weeks. Baghdad has kept thousands of Western men from
leaving both Iraq and Kuwait since its Aug. 2 invasion.
   The men said they planned their escape for over a month.
   ``It was Mohammed's birthday (a religious festival) and a
revolutionary holiday, so we felt they would be more relaxed than
normal,'' Manning said.
   ``We couldn't let anyone know that we had gone. We needed at
least 10 hours to get clear of Iraq, and if we had told anyone they
might have thought it safe to tell others within two or three
hours.''
   Just before they were rescued, the men said they saw what they
believed to be three warships on the horizon. They suspected they
were not Iraqi and decided to approach.
   The ships turned out to be two platforms and a barge, and the
men were greeted by a fellow Briton and brought on board for food
and a bath.
   The three escaped Britons, who had been working in the Iraqi
port of Basra, were reunited with their wives and families today.
   ``It is a marvelous feeling to be home,'' Teesdale said as he
hugged his wife, Margaret.

<HEAD>Yeutter Would Oppose Further Cut in Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
today he will oppose any effort to cut farm subsidies more than the
amount specified in the defeated $500 billion deficit-reduction
package.
   Yeutter, in a statement, said ``parochial interests overwhelmed
the national interest'' in Thursday night's 254-179 House defeat of
the budget agreement.
   ``The House did not have the political courage to cut
entitlement programs, and it was unwilling to increase revenues in
areas which add little or nothing to U.S. productivity,'' he said.
   ``This betrayal of political responsibility makes many
meritorious agricultural programs even more vulnerable to cuts than
before,'' Yeutter said. ``I will strongly resist any efforts to cut
agricultural expenditures further in any future budget
agreements.''
   Yeutter termed the agreement's $13 billion cut in farm programs
``a heavy hit'' on agriculture.
   But had the agreement been approved, he said, interest rates
probably would have declined. And that would be good news for
farmers, since it had been estimated over five years they would
save about $5 billion in interest costs and $3.5 billion on other
production expenses.

<TEXT>
   A legally blind AIDS victim has been
charged with robbing three banks in the two weeks since he was
paroled from prison because of his failing health.
   ``I just think that it is a slap in the face,'' said Parole
Board Chairman Kenneth Walker.
   District Court Judge Gilbert Indeglia ordered Robert Baird, 35,
held without bail Thursday on three counts of robbery, said Tom
Connell, a spokesman for the attorney general's office. Baird also
was accused of violating his probation terms.
   Baird had pleaded for parole for more than a year before his
Aug. 29 release. He accused officials of ignoring the fact that he
had acquired immune deficiency syndrome and letting him die in
prison.
   Baird wrote to politicians about going blind after prison
officials failed to detect spinal meningitis. He also wrote judges,
the American Civil Liberties Union, the Rhode Island Medical
Society and the attorney general.
   ``I am being tortured by the state of Rhode Island through the
Department of Corrections,'' Baird told a judge when he appealed
for a shorter sentence in May.
   William Devereaux, Baird's court-appointed lawyer for the past
several years, said Baird was hospitalized twice in the past two
years.
   ``On one occasion we didn't think he was going to make it,''
Devereaux said.
   Baird was sentenced to 50 years, with all but eight years
suspended, in February in connection with a bank robbery. He also
was sentenced to 10 years, with three years suspended, on a robbery
conviction in September 1988, Connell said.
   Baird's criminal record, which also includes assaults and drug
offenses, dates to 1974, said Corrections Department spokesman
Joseph DiNitto.
   Walker said Baird's arrest would not affect the board's handling
of future cases. At least five people have received compassionate
paroles in the past year because of AIDS.
   ``The board is such that it looks at each individual case,'' he
said.
   Baird was arrested Wednesday less than an hour after a robbery
at an Old Stone Bank branch, said police Detective Lt. Stephen
McCartney.
   A man in sunglasses and a hat entered the bank and told a teller
to put money in his bag, then fled with an undisclosed amount of
cash, McCartney said.
   A few minutes later, a cab driver in the area reported a
customer acting suspiciously.
   Police stopped the taxi, which was carrying Baird. He was
charged after bank employees identified him as the man who robbed
the bank Wednesday and a week ago as well, McCartney said.
   He also is a suspect in another robbery attempt Wednesday,
police said.

<TEXT>
   A man who fought City Hall and won
the entire building has sold it. Now the city is fighting back.
   The buyer's identity and the selling price were not disclosed,
and City Attorney Eric Vickers said he was unaware of the
transaction.
   But Vickers also said he planned to file an appeal today
protesting the original judgment that awarded the building to
Walter DeBow.
   ``You cannot take city property,'' Vickers said. ``The entire
transaction is illegal.''
   A court awarded DeBow the building and a former industrial site
Sept. 27 in compensation for a $3.4 million court judgment he won
years ago in a damages suit against this impoverished city.
   The ruling came after the 55-year-old DeBow suffered permanent
brain damage more than six years ago when he was beaten into a coma
by a fellow prisoner in the city jail. He was in jail for illegal
transportation of alcohol.
   DeBow has no short-term memory and needs care costing $325 a
day.
   Clyde Kuehn, DeBow's lawyer, declined to give details of the
sale.
   But Vickers has said City Hall is worth about $10 million. And
before DeBow received the other property, city officials had been
negotiating with a company to buy that site for $5 million to build
a trash recycling plant.
   East St. Louis, a city of 40,000 people, is plagued by debt
estimated at $47 million. A $34 million state bailout was enacted
in August to raise money though state bond issues.

<TEXT>
   A propane tank truck halted at the U.S.-Mexico
border for being overweight also held an estimated 3.5 tons of
cocaine, the Customs Service said.
   Federal agents still were tallying the exact amount early today.
   ``Upon verification, it is likely that this will be the largest
seizure of cocaine ever made at the ports of entry along the
California-Mexico border,'' said Quintin Villanueva, the Customs
Service's western regional commissioner.
   Ron D`Ulisse, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman, said
that if the estimated amount of cocaine is correct, it would have a
wholesale value of about $85 million and a street value in San
Diego of about $340 million.
   The Hidro Gas Juarez truck had been stopped Wednesday and held
overnight at the Otay Mesa border crossing in eastern San Diego
County because it weighed more than it should have.
   After waiting more than a day to drain the highly flammable
propane, drug-sniffing dogs alerted inspectors to the presence of
narcotics late Thursday.
   Before the cocaine was found, Customs inspectors had been
legally required to release the truck's driver, a Mexican national
whose name was withheld.
   ``We started (looking for narcotics) by searching the tires, and
by the very nature of the truck, (the inspection) was a very
dangerous job and we were proceeding cautiously,'' said the acting
customs district director, Tom Hardy.
   The driver faces 10 years to life in prison and fines up to $4
million if apprehended and convicted of smuggling charges.
   The largest previous cocaine seizure at a California-Mexico
border crossing was 1,290 pounds in 1988. The world's largest
cocaine haul of 21.5 tons, with an estimated street value of $20
billion, was made in September 1989 at a warehouse in Sylmar, near
Los Angeles.
   Hidro Gas Juarez is headquartered in Juarez, Mexico, with an
office across the border in El Paso, Texas. Company officials were
cooperating with authorities, Customs Service spokeswoman Bobbie
Cassidy said.
   Propane is used primarily for heating and cooking in the United
States. It also is a raw material for some chemical processes and
is used by farmers to dry crops.

   A smoky fire swept through an apartment building
for the elderly, killing five people and injuring about 50, some of
whom jumped from windows because the building lacked fire escapes.
   Fire Chief Harold Watkins said the four-story, 76-year-old
building also lacked sprinklers. Many of the injured suffered from
smoke inhalation while others suffered broken bones from their
leaps, he said.
   ``We tried to stop them from jumping,'' Watkins said of those
who leaped from the upper floors. ``We said the ladders would be
there. But the smoke was just too much for them. They just couldn't
stand it. They jumped.''
   The fire broke out Thursday night at the Majestic Manor senior
citizens complex in midtown Detroit. It was doused by early this
morning.
   Fire officials said the fire began in a first-floor apartment
because of a cooking mishap.
   A resident who declined to be identified said a neighbor knocked
on her door Thursday night to tell her the hallway was filled with
smoke.
   ``So I called the building manager and she told me a man on the
first floor had let his skillet burn over and that's what all the
smoke was,'' she said. ``So I went back to bed.
   ``Later, and I don't know what time it was, I woke up and my
apartment was filled with smoke. I sleep with the window open,
anyway, luckily. Otherwise, I might have been dead.''
   Police Sgt. Christopher Buck said today a 50-year-old man was
taken into custody while the fire is investigated. No charges were
filed immediately.
   Buck and Deputy Fire Chief Andrew Dempsey said five people died
in the blaze.
   Watkins said the victims died of smoke inhalation and were found
on the upper floors.

<TEXT>
   A cult leader's son was sentenced today
to a minimum 120 years in prison for the slayings of four members
of a family, killings he blamed on his father.
   Damon Lundgren, 19, appeared calm and stood with his hands
folded while Lake County Common Pleas Judge Paul H. Mitrovich
pronounced his sentence.
   Mitrovich ordered that Lundgren serve four consecutive
20-year-to-life sentences on aggravated murder convictions and four
consecutive 10-to-25-year sentences on kidnapping convictions.
   Lundgren was convicted last month on four counts each of
aggravated murder and kidnapping in the shooting deaths of Dennis
Avery and Avery's three young daughters. He was acquitted in the
death of Avery's wife, Cheryl.
   The Averys were led one by one into the barn, bound and gagged
with duct tape, then shot and dumped into a common grave at a farm
the cult rented in nearby Kirtland, about 30 miles east of
Cleveland. Authorities found te bodies in January.
   Thirteen cult members were arrested. Some have pleaded guilty to
reduced charges.
   Damon's father, Jeffrey Lundgren, said during his own sentencing
hearing that he killed the Averys because his interpretation of
Scriptures showed them to be sinners. He was sentenced to death in
the electric chair.
   The cult leader's wife, Alice Lundgren, got five consecutive
life sentences for conspiracy, complicity and kidnapping.
   Mitrovich chastised Lundgren for showing no remorse for his role
in the killings.
   ``You accept no blame. You blame your father. You claim this was
your father's doing and none of your own, but Jeffrey Lundgren
could not have done anything without the help and devotion of you
and his other followers,'' the judge said. ``Society cannot
tolerate such excuses.
   ``You apologized for what your father did and for what happened
to the Averys. But you did not apologize for your own part.''
   Defense attorney Albert Purola said the sentence was expected.
   Special Prosecutor Joseph Gurley said: ``We expected no less.
The jury had found he was an active participant and found him
guilty of these four murders. And the judge in our opinion imposed
the appropriate sentence.''
   Defense attorneys argued that Damon Lundgren was so strictly
raised and heavily controlled by his father that the youth was
unable to disobey the cult leader's orders to help wrestle at least
one victim to the ground and help bind and gag him.
   They also argued that the younger Lundgren did not actually pull
the trigger.
   The elder Lundgren sometimes would put a gun to his son's head
and tell his son to trust him, Damon said during his sentencing
hearing.
   ``I was afraid that if I disobeyed him, I would end up just like
those other people that died,'' he said. ``As far as my father was
concerned, those people disobeyed him and he killed them.''

   Four Germans held in Iraq since its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait arrived in Jordan today on their way home after
being freed by President Saddam Hussein in honor of Germany's
unification.
   The men arrived at Amman airport aboard a regularly scheduled
Iraqi Airways flight and were taken to the transit lounge to catch
a Royal Jordanian flight for Istanbul, Turkey.
   The flight was scheduled to continue on to Frankfurt later
today.
   German Embassy Charge d'Affaires Matthias Meyer said the four
were German citizens who had been working in Kuwaiti companies. He
did not give their names. ``They were all in good condition and
they were very happy that they were going home,'' Meyer said.
   The Iraqi News Agency called them ``foreign guests,'' the term
for the 2,000 Western men detained in Iraq and Kuwait, several
hundred at strategic sites to deter an attack by multinational
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, also did not give their
names.
   Their release is ``an expression of the Iraqi people joining in
the happiness of the German people in reuniting their country,''
the news agency quoted Parliamentary Speaker Mehdi Saleh as saying.
East and West Germany reunited Wednesday after four decades of Cold
War division.
   The news agency said the four Germans left Iraq with Brigitta
Koegler, deputy chairwoman of Democratic Awakening, a center-right
group associated with the Christian Democratic Party. Before
Germany's reunification, Ms. Koegler had been a lawmaker in the
Volkskammer, the former East German Parliament.

   Officials in central and south Florida are
advising people to avoid going outdoors at nightfall because of the
increasing risk of bites from mosquitoes spreading encephalitis.
   The number of cases of St. Louis encephalitis has reached 28
since the first was reported in August. Fifteen people were
hospitalized with the disease, which causes brain swelling; two are
comatose. Another seven cases are suspected and await further
tests.
   The disease kills about 7 percent of its victims. Little can be
done to treat it, but it can be avoided. Health officials are
telling everyone to stay indoors after dark and, if they do go
outside, to wear protective clothing and insect repellent.
   The outbreak is Florida's most threatening in 13 years. In 1977,
eight people died in the last statewide outbreak of the St. Louis
strain of encephalitis, which causes flulike symptoms.
   Some communities are spraying with insecticide. Others are
ordering school activities to cease by dark.
   In Broward County, school principals have been ordered to cancel
nature hikes, camping trips, fishing trips and water-related
activities that would increase student exposure to mosquitoes.
   Broward schools didn't cancel evening school activities, but
instead will have their ball fields sprayed with insecticide before
night games. A similar tactic is being used in Sumter County.
   In Martin County, beaches and county parks were ordered closed
at night.
   Pest control companies are also busy.
   In Marion County, an Ocala pest control company is donating a
natural mosquito pesticide to residents near bodies of standing
water not treated by local governments.

   Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., who plans to
retire this year after a decade in Congress, retired a bit early
and was the only House member to miss the vote on a budget
agreement.
   Crockett slept through the House's 254-179 vote early today
rejecting the five-year, $500 billion plan to reduce the federal
budget deficit.
   ``It's a little embarrassing,'' said aide Joan Willoughby. ``He
didn't intend to miss it.''
   Crockett was the only House member who did not vote on the
package.
   Earlier, however, he voted for a motion that brought the bill to
the floor and set ground rules for the debate, which lasted past
midnight.
   As the discussion droned on, Crockett ``came back to the office
to take a short nap,'' Willoughby said. ``He's 81 years old and he
has two hearing aids and he didn't hear the bells'' announcing the
vote on the budget package.
   The vote took place around 1:15 a.m. Friday.
   Crockett was the first member of the Michigan congressional
delegation to announce his support of the budget plan. However, he
changed his mind Thursday and had planned to vote against it,
Willoughby said.
   ``He had a chance to read the tea leaves, heard from a lot of
people back home, and he decided it was not the best package we
could get,'' she said.
   Crockett returned to his Detroit district this morning and was
unavailable for comment, Willoughby said. He announced earlier this
year he would retire after his current term expires in January.

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Klaus gained
strength off Antigua today and was upgraded to a hurricane after
leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the
Caribbean island of Martinique.
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus had sustained
winds of 80 mph this morning, up from 60 mph earlier. It remained
stalled 30 miles off Antigua but was expected to start moving again
later.
   It was uncertain whether Klaus, the sixth named hurricane of the
season, would reach the United States.
   ``We expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the
northwest and to be north of Puerto Rico and east of the Bahamas.
Beyond that, it's too early to say,'' said Bob Sheets, director of
the Miami Hurricane Center.
   Antigua's international airport was closed, said Stan
Cieniewicz, administrative officer for the island-based
Pan-Caribbean Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project.
   He said Klaus was expected to cut between Antigua, a popular
tourist spot, and its tiny sister island, Barbuda.
   Both islands are mainly flat, but Barbuda's 1,500 population is
located almost entirely in the capital, Codrington, protected by a
reef and lagoon.
   Early today, Antigua was being swept by high winds and
intermittent rain, but there were no reports of damage.
   Antigua's government radio station, ABS, said schools were
closed and residents were stocking up on supplies. It advised
residents to stay indoors. Later, both ABS and another staion were
knocked off the air by the winds.
   Authorities on Thursday evacuated hundreds of residents from the
French island of Martinique, where the storm left floodwaters
nearly 10 feet deep in some places. The dead and missing were
reported on that island.
   Hurricane warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands along an
arc from the French and Dutch island of St. Martin in the north to
the British colony of Montserrat in the south. Tropical storm
warnings remained in effect for Martinique and its sister island of
Guadeloupe.
   ``It stalled again, just hasn't moved. I think later today it'll
resume the northwestward drift,'' said hurricane specialist Max
Mayfield at the Miami center. ``I think the problem will come in
two to three days, when it gets to the northern Caribbean.''
   The Hurricane Center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was
possible for the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. That amount
could trigger mudslides and more flash flooding.
   At noon EDT, Klaus was centered near latitude 17.2 north and
longitude 61.3 west, or about 30 miles east-northeast of Antigua.
The system's hurricane-force winds extended 30 miles from its
center and tropical-storm forces 115 miles out.
   In Barbados, southeast of Martinique, floodwaters forced the
evacuation of a few families overnight and temporarily blocked some
roads, although the major tourist hotels on the western coast were
unaffected.
   Islands covered by hurricane warnings included St. Martin, St.
Barthelemy, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, the
British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and St. Kitts-Nevis.
   Many of the same islands were battered by Hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the region in September 1989 before hitting the Carolina
coast.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Josephine, downgraded last week to a
depression, strengthened in the mid-Atlantic to a hurricane late
Thursday. Josephine, with top winds of 75 mph, was reported at noon
EDT to be heading northeast at 16 mph about 750 miles southwest of
the mid-Atlantic Azores archipelago.
   Josephine, the fifth named hurricane of the season, posed no
immediate threat to land, located at latitude 32.6 north and
longitude 38.2 west.
   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when their maximum
sustained winds reach 74 mph.
   The hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Previous
hurricanes this year were Bertha, Diana, Gustav and Isidore.

<HEAD>King Says His Subjects Have Low Work Ethic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Swedes were in an uproar Friday
over their king's unprecedented comment that the Swedish work ethic
leaves something to be desired.
   ``I suppose that we maybe should think about the Swedish work
ethic and try and improve it in one way or the other. I assume
we're all aware that it is not the best,'' King Carl XVI Gustaf,
44, told Dagens Industri in an interview Thursday.
   The Swedish monarch very rarely speaks out on political or
controversial matters.
   Reaction came swiftly. Some people agreed with the king but
others suggested he was speaking for himself and his acquaintances.
   ``I wonder if he ever tried to work himself,'' said librarian
Anna Simkutte, labeling the royal comment ``utmost rubbish.''
   ``I suppose that the king makes his statement from the circles
where he dwells himself. In that case, that's an interesting
insight into those circles,'' the Aftonbladet newspaper quoted
labor federation spokesan Staffan Kellerborg as saying.
   A shoe repairman, who did not give his name, told The Associated
Press he agreed with the king, to some extent.
   ``There are supposed to be people who can live well between four
to eight years without lifting a finger,'' he said. ``But I think
that the majority works.''
   Critics have said the generous Swedish system for sick leave,
holidays and unemployment insurance encourages absenteeism and
makes some Swedish-made products too expensive.
   The king's duties include traveling abroad to promote Swedish
industries. He owns large estates and holds mostly a symbolic
function as a constitutional monarch.

   A prosecutor said today that sexually graphic
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe were convincing evidence in
themselves for a conviction in the obscenity trial of an art
gallery and its director.
   But a lawyer for the Contemporary Arts Center said the state
failed to show that the exhibit lacked artistic merit.
   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
are charged with one count each of pandering obscenity and one
count each of using children in nudity-related material.
   The misdemeanor charges stem from the exhibit ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' which appeared in Cincinnati
for seven weeks last spring.
   Barrie could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined $2,000 if
convicted of both counts. The gallery could be fined $10,000.
   Frank Prouty, an assistant city prosecutor, said in his closing
argument that five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men
and two that showed children with their genitals exposed were
enough for convictions. The charges against the gallery and its
director, Dennis Barrie, were based on those seven pictures in the
175-photo exhibit.
   ``The pictures speak for themselves,'' Prouty told the jury in
Hamilton County Municipal Court. ``The pictures are the issue.''
   Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, said the state failed to
prove its case against the center and Barrie. No presentation was
made to back up the assertion that the photographs were not
legitimate art.
   ``Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic
value? Don't you think that if there were people out there who
thought that, the state of Ohio would have found them?'' Mezibov
said.
   Barrie's attorney, H. Louis Sirkin, was scheduled to present his
closing remarks later Friday, and the case was expected to go to
the jury.
   Defense lawyers Thursday challenged the credentials of the
prosecution's only expert witness, Judith Reisman, on grounds that
she was not qualified, but Judge David Albanese ruled she could
testify.
   Ms. Reisman said her qualifications included having prepared
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian
Institution.
   She also worked as a consultant for television's ``Captain
Kangaroo'' show, for former Attorney General Edwin Meese's
commission on pornography and for the onservative American Family
Association.
   At issue in the trial are seven photographs a grand jury cited
from the 175-photo exhibit. Five of the pictures depict sexually
explicit acts involving men and two show children with their
genitals exposed.
   Ms. Reisman testified that photographing nude children can be a
prelude to sexual abuse.
   ``We are putting at risk additional children because many people
see themselves as photographers, and many people do use the
technique of telling children `this is appropriate because this is
in a museum,' `this is appropriate because it is in a book,''' she
said.
   ``That happens to be a standard technique for getting children
into a child sex-abuse situation.''
   Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe, who died last
year of AIDS at age 42, was an accomplished and respected
photographer, and that photographs of the children were morally and
sexually innocent.
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
run, an attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It
closes this week in Boston, where 103,000 tickets have been sold.

   Emergency crews Friday ended their 24-hour
search through the ruins of an apartment building after finding the
bodies of seven people killed in a suspected gas explosion.
   Eight people were injured, four seriously, when the explosion
shattered the five-story building early Thursday. One child lost a
foot and a baby was badly burned.
   Police said 49 people lived in the low-income housing unit in
Massy, a town on the western outskirts of Paris. By late Thursday,
all but two residents were accounted for, and they were located at
a friend's house Friday.
   About 170 rescue workers and dozens of emergency vehicles
responded to the disaster. Heavy cranes were used to lift chunks of
concrete and crumbling sections of roof and walls.
   Authorities said a gas leak in one of the apartments was the
most likely cause of the explosion. But gas company officials said
no faults were discovered in outside gas lines leading into the
building.

   Seven Sri Lankan activists have been
charged with blackmailing fellow refugees of their war-torn island
to raise money for a guerrilla group, police said Friday.
   The activists threatened Sri Lankan refugees with reprisals
against their families at home unless they contributed money to the
Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam, said Frede Rosenberg, a police
official from the Danish city of Holstebro.
   Two of the seven men charged in the case, including the leader
of the guerrilla group's Danish branch, were placed in custody
pending further investigations, Rosenberg said.
   He said the police have been working on the case for six months
and were tipped off by anonymous telephone calls from desperate
members of the Tamil community in Denmark, which numbers about
5,000.
   The activists were demanding monthly blackmail payments and had
sent the money to an address in Cyprus, Rosenberg said.
   Police earlier raided the group's offices in Copenhagen and in
the western town of Struer, confiscating membership lists and cash.

   China on Friday successfully launched its 30th
satellite, a retrievable remote-sensing device that is to be in
orbit for eight days, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The launch is China's fifth this year, its busiest since China
sent up its first satellite in 1970.
   The satellite was launched by a Long March-2 carrier rocket from
the Jiuquan space center in northwest China's Gansu province,
Xinhua said. It carried animals and plants whose reactions to
weightlessness will be studied.
   Already this year, China has launched two telecommunications
satellites, a test satellite and a meteorological satellite. In the
next two years, China plans to launch five satellites for foreign
buyers of its launch services, which are reported to be much
cheaper than in the West.

<TEXT>
   A dozen more crimes would be subject to the
federal death penalty and executions would be carried out more
quickly, under amendments approved by law and order-minded House
members.
   ``I hope we never bring up another crime bill a month before an
election,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., said Thursday as the House
bowed to conservative demands for a major reshaping of the measure.
   Hughes said campaign considerations were overshadowing the
debate, but critics of the bill said stern measures were needed to
curb mounting crime.
   Sarcastic cries of ``kill, kill, kill'' wafted through the House
as lawmakers added harsh provisions that Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.,
said were being demanded ``by the cop on the beat and the man on
the street.''
   The bill calls for the death penalty for more than 20 federal
crimes, including provisions added Thursday imposing capital
punishment for murder aboard trains, planes and automobiles as well
as in mail bombings, bank robberies and elsewhere.
   Assassination or attempted assassination of the president would
be punishable by death under the bill, as would treason and
espionage.
   The House today voted 216-204 to leave in the bill a provision
allowing death row inmates to use racial statistics in their
appeals to show the sentencing courts were biased.
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., offered the amendment that
would have stripped the provision from the bill. Supporters of the
amendment said the provision would dramtically weaken and perhaps
abolish use of the death penalty. Opponents said there was
indisputable evidence that blacks are more likely to be sentenced
to die than are whites.
   President Bush and congressional conservatives have been highly
critical of the provision, which was dropped from a Senate-passed
version of the crime bill.
   The House dealt Bush a victory Thursday by toughening provisions
giving death row inmates a time limit for filing habeas corpus
petitions claiming they have been treated unconstitutionally.
   Some convicts have filed one such petition after another, in
some cases using the process to escape the death chamber for a
decade or more.
   Lawmakers adopted 285-146 a substitute plan by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill., that would let states impose a time limit and place
curbs on repeated petitions. Hyde said it would stop ``endless,
endless, endless delays.''
   ``Over 2,350 murderers on death row are waiting for something to
happen,'' Hyde said in urging approval of the measure.
   The version dropped from the bill would have limited priooners
to one petition and required competent lawyers for them. But
critics said exceptions contained in the provision would have
resulted in even longer delays.
   Tempers frayed as the House prepared to approve a proposal by
Gekas to make a dozen more crimes subject to the death penalty.
Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, complained that Gekas had not
answered his question on how it would work.
   Gekas said it wasn't a ``good question,'' and Washington
shouted: ``You wouldn't know a good question if you heard it.''
   The House approved the Gekas plan, 271-159.
   As the bill came to the floor, it would have banned domestic
manufacture of any of the semiautomatic assault rifles whose
importation has been banned by Bush. The president acted in
response to complaints that the military-style weapons were
designed for killing humans rather than for sporting purposes.
   However, the House adopted 257-172 an amendment by Rep. Jolene
Unsoeld, D-Wash., that would allow domestic manufacture of the
rifles as long as the parts were American-made.
   Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based group that campaigns
for firearms restrictions, released a report from Unsoeld's
campaign committee to the Federal Election Commission showing a
$4,950 contribution from the National Rifle Association shortly
after the amendment was introduced.
   The group said in a statement that Unsoeld ``sold her political
soul to the assault weapon lobby in the hope that it will help her
get elected.''
   ``Absolute baloney,'' Unsoeld replied. She said she had not
discussed the amendment with the NRA before introducing it and had
not known about the campaign contribution at the time.
   The amendment was needed, she said, ``because there are a lot of
us who support the Second Amendment (right to bear arms) who would
feel compelled to vote against the bill otherwise.''

<HEAD>Expected GOP Gain No Longer So Sure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Oregon governor's race once was dismissed
by some as a near-certain GOP gain but the contest has come to life
as the candidates hammer each other on crime and other issues.
   A poll released this week showed Democratic Secretary of State
Barbara Roberts pulling even with Republican Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer, who earlier had been seen as the heavy favorite.
   ``If I'm not careful I may lose my underdog status,'' Roberts
quipped in a debate on Thursday.
   ``I think it's an inevitable narrowing,'' said Frohnmayer. ``I'm
just happy that this notion of front-runner is put to rest so
people can really focus on the differences between the
candidates,''
   Roberts' TV ads cast Frohnmayer as an ineffectual attorney
general who has done little about Oregon's crime and drug problems.
   Frohnmayer's ads attack Roberts' record on crime. One charges
that the former state legislator voted against a bill allowing
policewomen to carry radios they could use to call for help if
attacked by a suspected rapist.
   Both candidates are crying foul over the other's advertisements.
   Frohnmayer accused Roberts of ``false advertising.''
   ``Dave's been painting a picture of me I hardly recognize,''
Roberts maintained. ``Don't be fooled by fancy brush strokes.''
   Just a few months ago, some observers had written off the
governor's race as a snoozer in which Roberts was a hopeless
underdog against the better-financed Frohnmayer.
   ``A lot of people think the race is already over,'' state GOP
chairman Craig Berkman said in July.
   But a poll published in Thursday's Oregonian showed the
candidates neck-and-neck, with Frohnmayer favored by 44 percent of
those surveyed, and Roberts by 43 percent. The Sept. 25-30 survey
had a 4 percentage point margin of error.
   Roberts also announced this past week that she had raised $1.3
million for her campaign, considered a respectable amount for
someone who got a relatively late start in the race.
   Frohnmayer had raised $2 million in campaign contributions as of
June. His next campaign finance report is due Monday.
   Roberts jumped into the race one day after Democratic Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt's surprise announcement in February that he would not
seek a second term because of marital problems.
   Frohnmayer, one of Oregon's best known political figures,
already had spent months putting together an aggressive campaign.
   Also in the race are independent Al Mobley, a staunch
anti-abortionist who says Roberts and Frohnmayer are too liberal,
and Libertarian Fred Oerther, who has mounted no visible campaign.
   Mobley is seen as a possible spoiler in the race, since any
votes he gets in November probably will be at Frohnmayer's expense.
In the Oregonian poll, Mobley was supported by 7 percent of those
surveyed and Oerther was backed by fewer than 1 percent.
   Frohnmayer and Roberts, meanwhile, have been going at each other
for weeks, mainly over the crime issue.
   The two candidates also have argued over a measure on the Nov. 6
ballot to force a shutdown of the state's only nuclear power plant
until the federal government licenses a permanent disposal site for
radioactive waste.
   Roberts said she supports the measure because of concerns about
on-site storage of waste at the Trojan nuclear plant, located near
the Columbia River.
   Frohnmayer opposes the shutdown, saying it would leave the state
vulnerable to future energy shortages and cost utility customers
millions of dollars to pay for replacement energy sources.
   The candidates also have clashed over proposals to lock away
more old growth trees from logging to protect habitat for the
northern spotted owl. Frohnmayer has emphasized his support for the
timber industry and criticized Roberts for not challenging a
federal scientists' report recommending forest preserves for the
owl.

   Four suspended legislators charged in an
FBI investigation of corruption in the South Carolina Statehouse
pleaded innocent today to accepting bribes to support a pari-mutuel
betting bill.
   Democratic Reps. Ennis Fant, B.J. Gordon and Larry Blanding each
pleaded innocent to violating the Hobbs Act, a federal anti-bribery
law, in appearances before U.S. Magistrate Henry M. Herlong Jr. in
Columbia. They were each released on $25,000 bond.
   In Charleston, Republican state Rep. Thomas Limehouse stood
ramrod straight with hands clasped behind his back as he pleaded
innocent to bribery charges. U.S. Magistrate Robert Carr set a
trial date for Dec. 10 in Columbia. Limehouse was released on
$25,000 bond.
   ``I pleaded not guilty and I am not guilty. I look forward to my
day in court where I can see that the rest of the story can be
told,'' Limehouse said as he left the courthouse.
   The lawmakers arraigned today were charged Friday in the second
round of indictments following the 16-month FBI sting
investigation, dubbed Operation Lost Trust, into legislative vote
buying.
   House Speaker Bob Sheehan, a Democrat, suspended the indicted
lawmakers Friday.
   Four lawmakers indicted in August have already pleaded guilty to
selling their votes in support of a bill allowing voters to decide
whether to allow pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina. A fifth,
state Rep. Luther Taylor, is scheduled to stand trial later this
month.
   Blanding, 37, is charged with selling his vote in exchange for
$1,300. Fant, 29, was indicted for accepting two bribes for a total
of $1,300. Gordon, 57, a 17-year-veteran, was charged with
accepting a $1,000 bribe.
   Limehouse, 31, was charged with conspiracy to solicit bribes,
accepting $2,000 and tampering with a witness. He faces up to 50
years in prison and a fine of $750,000.
   Andy Savage, Limehouse's lawyer, indicated he will question
whether charges could be brought under the Hobbs Act since the
alleged bribes may not have affected interstate commerce.
   ``The bill, if it had passed, would have only produced an
opportunity for the electorate to vote yea or nay on pari-mutuel
betting,'' Savage said. ``There is a serious question ... whether
there is an impact on interstate commerce.''

   An earthquake shook parts of New
Zealand on Friday, knocking items off shelves but causing no
serious damage or injuries.
   The quake, measuring 5 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
was centered just off Cape Palliser on the southern tip of the
North Island.
   People in downtown Wellington experienced a sharp jolt at 11:50
a.m., followed by a rolling motion that lasted about 30 seconds.
Reports said the earthquake also was felt in the southern part of
the North Island and the northern part of the South Island.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A quake registering 5 can cause considerable damage,
especially in a populated area.

<TEXT>
   Police said today they were
lifting a 10-day-old, nighttime curfew in the black township of
Soweto because a sharp drop in political violence and crime no
longer made the restrictions necessary.
   Police imposed the 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew Sept. 25 in Soweto and
other nearby townships to halt black factional fighting around
Johannesburg that has claimed 800 lives in the past two months.
   Only scattered incidents have been reported in recent weeks, and
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said serious crime in Soweto
had dropped by about two-thirds as compared to the 10 days before
the curfew.
   Vlok praised residents in Soweto for ``outstanding cooperation''
with the police. Soweto, just outside Johannesburg, is the
country's largest township with 2.5 million inhabitants.
   The curfew will remain in effect in several other townships,
police said.
   The African National Congress, the leading black opposition
movement, has opposed the curfew, saying it was implemented to
weaken the normal organizational activities of the ANC.
   However, many Soweto residents said the curfew, while
inconvenient, has made the township safer.
   In other developments today, Nelson Mandela and other ANC
officials met leaders of five black homelands at Mandela's home in
Soweto.
   However, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu homeland and
head of the conservative Inkatha movement, declined to attend.
   Most of the township fighting has been between the ANC and
Inkatha. Buthelezi says he wants one-on-one talks with Mandela to
discuss the violence. The ANC has refused the request, saying
Buthelezi has used the fighting to seek a meeting with Mandela that
would enhance his stature.
   After today's meeting, Mandela said all participants agreed an
unidentified ``third force'' was instigating the black factional
fighting.
   ``It's not tribal violence at all,'' Mandela said. ``It is
orchestrated by certain faceless forces in this country.''
   Mandela and other black leaders have accused right-wing
extremists, including members of the police and military, of
fueling the fighting.
   Also, ANC and government delegations met in Pretoria to work out
details of the ANC's decision to suspend its guerrilla campaign.
The two sides have held periodic talks since the ANC suspended its
largely ineffective armed struggle Aug. 6.
   President F.W. de Klerk says it wants to launch full-scale
constitutional negotiations soon with the ANC and other opposition
groups. De Klerk says he wants to end apartheid and set up a
democratic system that allows the 5 million whites and 30 million
blacks to share power.

   Six gunmen dressed in military fatigues
Friday killed nine people in eastern Colombia, including seven
members of one family, police said.
   The gunmen fled after carrying out the massacre at a cattle
ranch near the town of Tauramena, 100 miles east of the capital,
Bogota. They were apparently leftist guerrillas belonging to the
radical National Liberation Army, according to a statement from
police in the state of Meta.
   It did not explain why the gunmen were wearing military clothes
or give a motive for the murders.
   Although the guerrilla group is the country's most radical and
active, most massacres of civilians are carried out by right-wing
death squads seeking to crush the guerrillas.

   A man who hijacked a Soviet airliner to
Finland today and threatened to blow it up surrendered after
negotiating with authorities at Helsinki International Airport,
police said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the man, who hijacked the plane
during a domestic flight in the Soviet Union, turned out to be
unarmed.
   ``The hijacker wanted to go to Stockholm, (Sweden), but he was
told there was not enough fuel ... He is currently being
interrogated by police,'' said Chief Inspector Pertti Virolainin.
   The 40-year-old man, identified by police as Nikolai Ivanovich
Selivano, applied for political asylum, Virolainin told reporters.
   The Soviet Embassy later requested extradition of the hijacker.
   The hijacked Aeroflot Yak-40 aircraft carried 22 passengers -
including two children - and a crew of four, Finnish authorities
said. The 28-seat plane was flying northwest of Moscow when the man
forced the pilot to change course.
   ``All the passengers were, of course, very worried and we passed
the two children from lap to lap so that they wouldn't run in the
aisle,'' said passenger Antonina Urjetskaya, 68, of Novgorod.
   ``My heart is in bad shape, so I was very worried, but I took a
heart pill and I am very glad that the situation ended so well,''
she said.
   The hijacker was not identified. Tass said he had threatened to
blow the plane up but did not say what type of explosives he had
claimed to possess.
   Earlier this year, five domestic planes were hijacked to Finland
and Sweden by young men who said they were political dissidents or
fugitives from the Soviet army. Swedish and Finnish officials
extradited four of them. One was given political asylum in Sweden.
   The Leningrad air traffic control center told Finnish
authorities about the hijacked plane 25 minutes before it landed at
the Helsinki airport today.
   The aircraft was on its way from Novgorod, 310 miles northwest
of Moscow, to Leningrad and Petrozavodsk. It was hijacked before it
reached Leningrad.
   The passengers were to be flown back to the Soviet Union after
they made statements to the police. A Soviet Embassy official met
the passengers at the airport and said if anyone ``wants to stay in
Finland, step outside,'' said Yevgeni Khodorkovski, a passenger.
   Khodorkovski, 32, of Leningrad, laughed at the official. He said
he and his wife had received exit visas to emigrate to Israel, but
would go home again first and leave the country legally.

<TEXT>
   The world's largest private collection of books on
Rome sold for about $4 million during a three-day sale that ended
Friday, Christie's auctioneers said.
   Top price for the sale was $240,000 paid anonymously by a
European Continental buyer for a 14-volume set of etchings by
Giovanni Battista Piranesi. The 18th century artist's etchings of
architectural views on a grand scale are still influential today.
   The books had belonged to Franklin H. Kissner, an American who
died in 1988. Kissner was a colonel and deputy director of
economics for the U.S. military government in Berlin at the end of
World War II.
   ``He had a lifelong interest in Rome, building up a collection
of more than 4,000 rare book titles,'' said Tom Lamb, Christie's
book expert.
   Kissner owned an apartment on the Piazza Navona in Rome as well
as his home in New York City's Gramercy Park.

<HEAD>Death Sentence Replays Will Bog Down Courts</HEAD>

   Many of the inmates on Oregon's death row are
headed back to new sentencing hearings in the state's already
sluggish court system because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
   ``It's not going to shut the system down. But anything with a
death penalty attached to it takes more time and effort than those
cases without the death penalty,'' said Phil Lemman, an assistant
to state Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer.
   The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday with the Oregon Supreme
Court that three death sentences should be overturned.
   The state court had said that, because of a 1989 U.S. Supreme
Court decision, the defendants were entitled to have mitigating
evidence presented to the sentencing jury.
   The result is that many of the 23 men sentenced to death before
the 1989 decision may qualify for new sentencing hearings.
   Oregon's capital punishment law, passed by voters in 1984,
establishes a two-step court proceeding.
   The jury first decides whether a defendant is guilty of
aggravated murder. If guilty, the jury decides whether the
defendant should die by injection.
   Under the initial version of the law, a death sentence was
imposed if the jury unanimously found the defendant posed a future
threat of violence, acted deliberately in the killing and killed
without provocation.
   The 1989 Legislature revised the law to take into account the
U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The Oregon Supreme Court then fashioned
an additional question on mitigating circumstances for jurors to
consider.
   The court said the jury can weigh any aspect of a defendant's
background, or any circumstances of the offense that would justify
life imprisonment instead.
   Frohnmayer appealed the state Supreme Court ruling, arguing that
it went far beyond constitutional requirements. He said mitigating
factors for the jury to consider should be limited to those bearing
on a defendant's moral blameworthiness.
   Lemman said it will be some time before it's determined how many
new sentencing proceedings will be needed.
   In any case, he said, the sessions will require time and
expense.
   ``These are not going to be quick two-hour hearings,'' he said.
   The law allows evidence from the trial to submitted to the
sentencing jury, and witnesses can be recalled to testify. New
lawyers also could be involved.
   The chief criminal judge in Multnomah County, which has the
state's biggest trial court system, said new death sentence
proceedings will add to the work but probably won't disrupt court
dockets.
   Circuit Judge Philip Abraham said it appears up to six
death-sentence cases will require new hearings in his county.
   ``It will impact the system somewhat, but I don't see it as
insurmountable,'' Abraham said.
   His court system handles about 5,000 felony cases annually and
had 31 murder cases pending at the beginning of October.
   The Oregon Supreme Court already had sent eight death penalty
cases back to trial courts for new sentencing hearings at the time
of the U.S. Supreme Court decision.
   Prosecutors have the option of seeking life terms instead of
death sentences, and one district attorney so far has case has
decided on a life sentence.
   In three other cases, death sentences were set aside when murder
convictions were reversed by the state Supreme Court.
   All death sentence cases automatically are appealed to the state
Supreme Court.

   Barbara Bush welcomed Princess Diana to the
White House today for coffee and a discussion of the AIDS epidemic
and a local home that cares for child victims of the disease.
   ``Good morning,'' Mrs. Bush cheerily greeted the princess as she
left her limousine in front of the White House on a sunny morning.
They posed briefly for pictures before going in for coffee with the
Bushes' daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, and daughter-in-law Margaret
Bush, the wife of the Bushes' son Marvin.
   Diana, who wore a rose-colored suit with purple trim, was
accompanied by Lady Jennifer Acland, wife of the British
ambassador, Sir Antony Acland. Mrs. Bush wore a long-sleeved blue
dress.
   The princess planned to discuss her interest in AIDS patients
with the first lady before heading to Grandma's House, a Washington
home for young AIDS victims.
   Diana attended a charity gala Thursday night to benefit the
home. Several prominent organizers boycotted the event on the
grounds the ticket prices were too high.
   The princess was aware of the controversy, said British embassy
spokesman Francis Cornish. He said he did not know her opinion of
the ticket prices. But, he said, ``You can't wander into somebody
else's country and say something's too steep.'' The minimum ticket
price was $2,500, but most people paid $3,500, which included the
honor of shaking Diana's hand.
   Despite the acrimony that arose over ticket prices, Cornish said
Diana enjoyed the charity event and ``thought everybody else who
turned up did.''
   Diana wore a fuchsia silk off-the-shoulder dress to the gala.
She entered to the strains of Handel's Water Music and presided
over a table that included two of President Bush's children, Marvin
Bush and Dorothy LeBlond.
   In addition to Grandma's House, the gala benefitted the
Washington Ballet, the London City Ballet and the British-American
Arts Association.
   The 29-year-old princess, who is married to Prince Charles, has
had longstanding interests in those areas.
   She is patron of London City Ballet and has been involved with
AIDS patients since 1987. She visited a pediatric AIDS unit at
Harlem Hospital last year during a trip to New York City and has
made similar visits to adult patients in London.
   Her second solo trip to the United States began Thursday
afternoon with tea at the British ambassador's residence and
continued late into the evening at the benefit.
   A number of women on the event's organizing committee did not
attend, among them television personality Barbara Walters and
Georgette Mosbacher, wife of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   The ostensible reason was that ticket prices, at $2,500 or
$3,500, were too high. Mrs. Mosbacher asked for her money back,
said Joanna Seymour, media manager for London City Ballet.
   Celebrities who did show up included Patricia Hearst, Democratic
fundraiser Pamela Harriman, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
and the British and French ambassadors.
   Some 260 tickets were sold, with guests who paid the higher
price entitled to shake hands with Diana at a pre-dinner champagne
reception.
   The Departmental Auditorium, its gilded pillars draped with
greenery, fruit, flowers and sheaves of wheat, was far from full.
But the British and corporate organizers of the evening declared it
a success.
   Seymour said the two ballet companies and Grandma's House would
each receive more than $100,000. The arts association was in line
for at least $20,000, she said.
   Seymour said ticket prices were discussed ``ad nauseum'' and
determined in consultation with the British and U.S. organizing
committees. The bottom line, she said, is that 260 tickets were
sold and money was raised.
   ``It's not a matter of who buys the tickets,'' Seymour said.
``This is not an evening for people to see and be seen at. This is
an evening to raise serious money for worthwhile charities.''
   The benefit featured a short auction run by John Marion,
chairman of Sotheby's New York. A diamond-and-pearl necklace set in
18-carat white gold, designed by a London jeweler especially for
the occasion, brought $22,000. A gold and enamel carriage clock
with the royal monogram, donated by Diana, sold for $7,500.
   Each guest received a vial of Christian Dior perfume and a
program decorated with gold tassels and seals, inscribed in gold
with the night's menu.
   The dinner included a seafood-filled brioche, filet of beef and
an elaborate pastry and fruit dessert on plates individually
decorated with chocolate designs before serving. Wine, champagne
and cognac were donated, along with 500 gold chairs flown in from
Britain to match the flatware.
   Overhead was expected to be low because most costs were picked
up by ADT, the chief sponsor of the gala, and other corporate
contributors.
   ADT describes itself as the leading provider of electronic
security protection and vehicle auction services, with operations
throughout North America, the United Kingdom and continental
Europe.

<HEAD>Harvard Cleared of Asian Discrimination Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department Friday said Harvard
University has been cleared of charges its undergraduate admission
policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
   Michael Williams, assistant secretary for civil rights, said an
examination of records found Asian Americans were admitted to
Harvard at a lower rate than white applicants mainly because of the
preference given to children of alumni and recruited athletes -
groups in which there are few Asian Americans.
   ``While these preferences have an adverse effect on Asian
Americans, we determined that they were longstanding and
legitimate, and not a pretext for discrimination,'' said Williams,
who made completing reviews at Harvard and UCLA his highest
priority when he joined the agency in July.
   On Monday, the department announced a finding of discrimination
against Asian Americans seeking admission to the University of
California at Los Angeles graduate mathematics program. UCLA now
must offer admission to five Asian-American students who had been
``discriminatorily denied admission.''
   Williams said the Office of Civil Rights could find no evidence
of a quota at Harvard limiting Asian Americans, who have gone from
being 5.5 percent of the class in 1983 to being 19.6 percent of the
class of 1994.
   The two-year investigation included a review of thousands of
applicant files and 10 years of applicant data provided by Harvard,
as well as dozens of interviews with staff and other individuals,
Williams said.
   Investigatios have been conducted in response to complaints
alleging that several schools, including Harvard and UCLA, were in
violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The law
stipulates that recipients of federal funds cannot discriminate on
the basis of race, color or national origin.

   Garbage truck drivers Friday ended an 18-day strike
that produced huge piles of uncollected trash on Paris sidewalks
and forced emergency action by city officials.
   Union leaders said the strikers decided to return to work even
though their wage demands were not fully met.
   Jean Tibiri, chief deputy to Mayor Jacques Chirac, said the city
decided unilaterally to implement its offer to increase the
drivers' pay by $23 to $39 a month, according to seniority.
   Tibiri said no reprisals would be taken against the 600 drivers
who heeded the strike call of the leftist General Confederation of
Labor. But he said they would not be paid for the days they were on
strike as the drivers had demanded.
   On Sept. 21, the fourth day of the strike, Chirac announced
private firms had been hired to collect the fast-accumulating
trash. He also took legal action that forced the strikers to
abandon blockades at the three incineration plants where garbage
from throughout the metropolitan region is taken.
   Chirac said the health of more than 4 million people was at
risk.

<HEAD>Casiraghi To Be Buried In Chapel Overlooking The Sea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONACO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stefano Casiraghi, Princess Caroline's husband,
will be buried at a private chapel overlooking the sea in which he
died, the royal palace said Friday.
   The palace said the private burial service would take place
immediately after a public funeral Saturday at the Cathedral of
Monaco.
   Prior to the announcement, there had been uncertainty whether
Casiraghi would be buried in the principality or in Italy, where
his parents live.
   Casiraghi's speedboat flipped over Wednesday during the World
Offshore Championships.
   Residents of Monaco were allowed to view Casiraghi's body
Thursday at a mortuary near Princess Grace hospital.
   On Friday, a palace spokesman said, the coffin was closed and
taken to the palace for a private family Mass.
   The funeral service is scheduled for late Saturday morning at a
115-year-old cathedral situated just below the palace. It can
accommodate more than 2,000 people.
   Casiraghi, who was 30, is to be buried in the Chapelle de la
Paix. Also buried in the private chapel is another commoner who
married into the royal family - dancer John Gilpin, the late
husband of Prince Ranier's sister, Antoine.
   After the burial, some of Casiraghi's fellow speedboat racers
plan to ride aboard a yacht to the site where the accident occurred
and lay a wreath in his memory.
   An Italian newspaper, Il Secolo XIX of Genoa, reported Friday
that Casiraghi's parents were ``deeply irritated'' by the royal
family's decision to display the coffin at the mortuary rather than
in the palace.
   The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, also reported that the
Casiraghis and the royal family were at odds about whether the
funeral and burial should be in Monaco or Italy.
   The speedboat championships, in which Casiraghi was seeking to
defend his world title, were canceled after crews from the other 41
boats withdrew.
   Casiraghi had been racing at world-class level since 1984. He
had told friends he planned to quit after this season.
   Casiraghi's death came eight years after Caroline's mother,
Princess Grace, was killed in a car accident.
   He and Caroline were married on Dec. 29, 1983, in a civil
ceremony. They had three children.

   Mark Spencer spent $250 asking Lora
Sheppard to marry him, and she didn't even notice at first.
   Spencer, 31, set his romantic stage by gathering about 30
friends for a parking-lot party before Saturday's University of
Arizona football game. The engagement ring was tucked in his
pocket. Also tucked out of sight was a chilled, 2{-foot bottle of
champagne.
   Not so invisible was the airplane he hired to tow a banner
reading: ``LORA WILL YOU MARRY ME SPENCE.''
   But Ms. Sheppard, 28, didn't notice the plane. She raised her
eyes only after friends began to encircle her and one told her to
look up.
   ``Oh my God,'' she exclaimed.
   To make sure she got the message, Spencer dropped to one knee
and popped the question.
   ``I just hugged him and said, `Yes! Yes!'' she said later.
   The two have known each other since July 1989 and had discussed
marriage, ``but I was expecting we'd go to dinner or something, and
he'd ask me there,'' she added. ``I had no idea it would be this.''
   They have yet to set a date, ``but it's definitely on,'' Spencer
said.

   Stocks and bonds staged a strong recovery today
after diving in reaction to House rejection of President Bush's
plan to reduce the budget deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, the best-known
measurement of the stock market, tumbled nearly 70 points when
trading began but recovered. By early afternoon, it was up 25
points to the 2,540 level.
   Traders said stocks received a boost when Britain announced that
the pound will enter Europe's exchange rate mechanism, effective
Monday. That lifted share prices in London, and the enthusiasm
transferred to New York.
   The opening plunge triggered an NYSE restraint on computerized
selling strategies aimed at helping stabilize the market, an
outgrowth of the stock market crash nearly three years ago.
   Concern over rising oil prices and persistent turmoil in the
Persian Gulf contributed to the drop.
   But traders apparently decided to place concern over the budget
crisis on hold.
   ``Everybody's disappointed by the (budget pact failure) but in
the end I think people have decided not to let it bother them for
awhile,'' said Dudley Eppel, a strategist with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy and
interest rates, the key 30-year Treasury bond was down about $2 per
$1,000 face amount, after falling close to $6 earlier in the day.
Its yield, which rises when the price falls, rose to 8.81 percent
from 8.79 percent late Thursday.
   The House voted 254-179 early today to spurn Bush's plan aimed
at trimming $500 billion from the staggering federal deficit that
is keeping interest rates high.
   The rejection doused investor hopes that the Federal Reserve
would take quick action to lower interest rates, which would have
tended to make stocks and bonds more valuable.
   Economists said investors also remained anxious about a possible
outbreak of war in the 2-month-old Persian Gulf crisis, which has
doubled the price of oil since early this summer and raised the
threat of acute inflation.

   About 300 Americans and foreign-born family
members have signed up for an evacuation flight due to leave Kuwait
next Wednesday, the State Department said Friday.
   The passengers will arrive at Raleigh-Durham airport in North
Carolina on Thursday after an overnight stay in London, deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher said. The flight will go from Baghdad to
Kuwait and then back to Baghdad before flying on to London.
   Boucher declined to say how many of the 300 are Americans. The
flight will be the first U.S. government-sponsored charter to
evacuate Americans and their family members since Sept. 22.
   About 1,900 Americans have left the two countries aboard these
flights since they were instituted a month ago. The large majority
have been women and children.
   The State Department said late last month that at least 900 U.S.
citizens remain trapped, including 600 to 700 in Kuwait and 300 to
350 in Iraq.

   A 2,000-pound Brahman bull got loose at
the Mississippi State Fair, scattering crowds and bowling over
pursuers.
   ``If it had of been any other kind of bull but a Brahman, we
could have walked right up to it,'' said Jamie Cox, 24, of Edwards.
``But Brahmans are mean.''
   The bull snapped its rope behind a barn Thursday night and
wandered into a field where cars and livestock trailers were
parked. Then the bull, apparently frightened by a growing circle of
onlookers, stormed toward the midway.
   ``I looked up and saw a lot of scary looks like there was a gang
fight,'' said Johnny Minninger, 32, of Madison. ``All of a sudden,
a bull came out of the crowd with about 50 people chasing it.''
   Fire Lt. Rudy Brooks suffered a blow to his left knee when he
tangled with the bull. He said it knocked him into a trailer and
under it.
   ``I had him around the head trying to keep from getting my
insides squashed out,'' Brooks said.
   The bull took off ``straight out toward and directly past the
front gate, made his way to Kiddy Land, past the circus and cut
across the midway,'' said Harold Roosa III, 27, of Kansas City,
Mo., a Bluegrass Shows employee.
   As it sped past the circus, the bull belted a man in a
wheelchair, Roosa said. The man was uninjured.
   The growing crowd steered the bull into a left turn, past a
concession stand, and into the livestock judging arena where it was
corralled with a makeshift cage.
   ``We brought in another bull and a heifer to tame him down,''
Brooks said.

   A temporary clerical worker became a
temporary millionaire when a bank accidentally put $7.5 million in
her money market account.
   Elizabeth Shilling thought at first the nine-digit number on her
receipt was a bank code when she deposited $132.28 on Sept. 28 at a
PSFS branch.
   The next day, she realized the bank teller mistakenly had
credited her account with $7,500,132.28. Later that day, a note
from the bank confirmed the error.
   ``We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused,'' it
said.
   The widowed mother of four admitted to fleeting thoughts of
moving to a tropical island or buying a word processor, but said
she never seriously considered trying.
   ``I thought it was funny,'' she said Wednesday. ``I knew I
couldn't spend the money.''
   Bank spokeswoman Rebecca Brinks said errors of such size
occasionally occur.
   Shilling said it wasn't the first time she was enriched by
mistake.
   Once a teller mistakenly credited her savings account with
$17,000. Another time a teller gave her $380 when she withdrew only
$80.
   ``I must look poor,'' she said. ``I must look like I need
money.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq's foreign minister today accused the
United States and its allies of bringing ``the entire world to the
brink of a devastating war'' in a quest to gain control of the
Middle East's oil.
   In a prepared speech, Tariq Aziz said the U.N. Security Council
was hypocritical when it penalized Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait
while allowing Israel to continue occupying Arab lands seized in
1967 and 1973 wars.
   He proposed that all Middle East problems - ``Palestine,
Lebanon, the gulf and others'' - be considered on the same basis.
   An Iraqi envoy was to read the Aziz speech to the General
Assembly this evening. A text of the speech was obtained in advance
by The Associated Press.
   Aziz did not come to New York to deliver the speech because the
United States denied landing rights for the plane the Iraqi
delegation has used in the past, proposing instead that Aziz take a
commercial flight.
   The foreign minister said in the speech that America and its
allies ``are seeking to gain control over the oil reserves in the
gulf so as to have a free hand in manipulating the needs of the
world, and especially the needs of the peoples of the Third World,
for this important commodity.''
   He accused Iraq's foes of deploying ``fleets, aircraft and
ground forces in the region in a way that has no parallel in
contemporary history, thus bringing the entire region, nay the
entire world, to the brink of a devastating war.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, prompting the United States and
other nations to send tens of thousands of troops and scores of
warships to the gulf in a bid to force Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait. The United Nations also imposed a trade embargo on Iraq and
allowed other nations to use force to uphold it.
   The speech said the United States and its allies are
manipulating world opinion to conceal Kuwait's identity as part of
Iraq until 1913, when Britain ``undertook to sever Kuwait from
Iraq.''
   It accused the United States and its Western allies of ``pushing
the world, in the context of one of the most dangerous and
pernicious campaigns of disinformation known to history, into a new
imperialistic era.''
   ``The United States is seeking, in a dangerously coercive
manner, to impose its hegemony over the world,'' Aziz said.

   The Mormon Church's 160th Semiannual
General Conference this weekend finds the faith a study in familiar
contrasts: a robust and growing membership headed by an aged
prophet in declining health.
   The faith's tradition of succession by apostolic seniority has
bred a gerontocracy that averages 70.8 years of age and produces
presidents considerably older and more prone to infirmity.
   ``I don't think anyone has to be told of the negatives of a
gerontocracy in terms of the medical realities,'' said D. Michael
Quinn, a former Brigham Young University professor who's writing a
history of the church's hierarchy.
   ``The other problem is that you have, at the highest leadership
of the church, men . . . who are at least two generations,
sometimes three generations, removed from the majority of the
population of the church.''
   But there are also advantages in having well-seasoned
administrators in the governing First Presidency and its advisory
body, the Council of the Twelve Apostles, he said.
   The 160-year-old church is struggling to cope with a rate of
growth that has seen membership more than double every 15 years
since 1945.
   At that rate, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
with 7.5 million members and more than 40,000 full-time
missionaries, will have 265 million members by 2080, according to a
study by Rodney Stark, a non-Mormon professor of sociology and
comparative religion at the University of Washington. The church
has 4.2 million members in the United States.
   ``What you have to realize is that a group can look small for a
long time and then all of a sudden it just explodes,'' Stark said.
``So just wait until all these people convert their relatives and
see how it really kicks in.''
   The latest casualty of advancing years is Ezra Taft Benson, the
church's president since 1985. Mormons believe Jesus Christ directs
the church's affairs through the president, who is considered a
``prophet, seer and revelator.''
   Benson, 91, remained hospitalized Friday in serious condition
two weeks after surgery for blood clots on the brain.
   He was able to maintain a full schedule for only the first
couple of years of his five-year tenure. His predecessor, Spencer
W. Kimball, was mostly incapacitated for the five years before his
death in 1985 at age 90.
   But church spokesman Don LeFevre said the hierarchy doesn't miss
a beat when its leader falters.
   ``When the president of the church becomes incapacitated, the
network is already in place and his counselors and the Council of
the Twelve Apostles simply carry on,'' LeFevre said.
   When a church president dies, the office is filled by the
president of the Twelve, that body's most senior apostle. Howard W.
Hunter, a former corporate lawyer, is Benson's heir apparent.
   Hunter will be 83 Nov. 14. A widower, he remarried last spring
and puts in full days, LeFevre said.
   Church leaders in 1978 provided for retirement of members of the
First Quorum of the Seventy, which acts under the direction of the
Twelve, giving some members emeritus status.
   The move was seen as a way to inject new blood in the hierarchy,
but the policy has never been extended to include the Twelve.
   But eventually, Quinn said, the Mormon gerontocracy likely will
face a crisis of succession where the heir to the prophetic mantle
is himself ``unable not simply to walk, unable to talk, but unable
to function in any recognizable way in front of an audience to even
acknowledge he is the president of the church.''
   ``They've been spared that thus far, but if that occurs, I don't
know what they'll do,'' he said.

   Police fired on rioting prisoners at a
maximum-security jail in the capital Friday, killing seven inmates
and wounding 107 others, a senior prison official said.
   At least 76 jail officials also were injured in the riot at
Tihar Jail on the southeastern outskirts of the city, said Hari
Prem Kumar, the inspector general of prisons.
   About 2,500 inmates rioted for more than three hours and also
tried to escape, Kumar said.
   Press Trust of India said the riot was sparked by the death of
an inmate Thursday night and later turned into a mass escape
attempt. The rioters accused jail officials of failing to give the
inmate adequate medical treatment.
   Press Trust quted jail authorities as saying the prisoner,
identified only as Hari Singh, died of natural causes. But United
News said there was a report that Singh was killed in a clash
between rival gangs.
   The charges on which Singh had been jailed were not immediately
known.
   Tihar jail houses prisoners who are awaiting trial or have been
convicted of ordinary crimes as well as those detained in cases
related to violence arising from separatist revolts such as the
ones in Punjab and Kashmir.

   Something smells in Mayberry, and it's
not Aunt Bee's plum-apple pie.
   A woman has been charged with have malodorous dogs in the town
that served as the loose model for the 1960s hit TV series ``The
Andy Griffith Show.''
   ``I just think it's not right ... not fair,'' said Jan Peters,
who owns 11 dogs, including nine puppies.
   Police Chief Leo W. Shores said that since April 30, his
department has had 10 complaints about Ms. Peters' dogs. A
complaint Wednesday led to the charges of fouling of the air by
odors.
   Ms. Peters, 38, also was accused of letting her dogs be too
noisy.
   Shafer E. Gwyn, 77, who lives next door, said he hasn't been
able to sit on his carport or cook on his outside grill for the
past month because of the odor.
   Officer J.W. Shropshire agreed.
   ``When I went on his carport, it liked to knocked me down,''
Shropshire said.
   Ms. Peters said she didn't think her dogs were too loud or too
smelly, but she called the animal shelter to have someone pick them
up. The violations carry a $50 fine.
   Ms. Peters said her 8-year-old daughter, Stephanie, cried. ``She
loves those babies. She said, `Mama, I won't have nothing to cuddle
up to anymore.'''
   Mount Airy, 35 miles northwest of Winston-Salem, is the hometown
of actor Andy Griffith, who portrayed the folksy widowed sheriff
whose beloved Aunt Bee helped him raise his son.

<HEAD>Unemployment Rises Again; Analysts Fear Recession Has Started</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's unemployment rate worsened for the
third straight month in September, the government said Friday. Many
analysts saw the report as evidence that the economy has quietly
slipped into a recession.
   The increase in the civilian jobless rate to 5.7 percent,
coupled with unemployment rises in July and August, marked the
first time since the depths of the 1981-82 recession that the
jobless rate has increased three months in a row, the government
said.
   ``Let's face it; it's a trend. We've been pushed over the edge.
... We're in a recession and it's going to go on for at least six
to nine months,'' said David Wyss, an analyst for DRI-McGraw Hill.
   The Bush administration insists the economy has not fallen into
a recession, but presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after
Friday's announcement that ``we're certainly concerned about the
economy.''
   Fitzwater said that concern was heightened by the House
rejection of a proposed deficit-reduction agreement, which the
administration had touted as the budgetary fix needed to convince
the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates and spur the
flagging economy.
   ``Today, we see unemployment jump to 5.7 percent, which only
emphasizes the urgency of this situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   But many analysts said Friday's report, showing unemployment up
0.1 percentage point and at its highest level since the spring of
1988, made clear that the economy has lost the strength necessary
to avoid toppling over the edge into a recession.
   ``Fallen off? We're in midair and I don't think we've reached
the bottom yet,'' said Ian Borsook, a senior economist with Merrill
Lynch.
   More industries lost jobs than gained them in September, causing
an overall loss of 101,000 jobs from non-farm payrolls, the Labor
Departmet said.
   About 42,000 of those losses were census workers laid off by the
government. But Janet Norwood, the commissioner labor statistics,
noted that the weakness in the September job market had hit
factories and service industries as well.
   ``Few areas of the economy are escaping the downward tug of the
current economic slowdown,'' Mrs. Norwood said.
   The nation's employment picture began a downward spiral in July,
as the economy failed to produce enough jobs to keep up with the
number of Americans looking for work. Since then, the jobless rate
has risen 0.5 percentage point from June's 5.2 percent.
   The rapid jump in unemployment reflects an economy that was
showing little signs of life even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait sent oil prices soaring and increased fears of an imminent
downturn.
   The government's technical definition of a recession - two
quarters of economic decline as measured by the gross national
product - has not officially been met.
   Indeed, the GNP for the year's third quarter is expected to post
a small gain, even with September's lackluster performance. Many
analysts think a full-fledged downturn will take hold in the fourth
quarter.
   The 101,000-job loss in September, though inflated by the census
workers, was the biggest job decline since the economy lost 104,000
jobs in June 1986, the government said. A year ago, the economy was
creating nearly 200,000 jobs a month.
   The slump in the manufacturing sector continued in September,
with factory jobs posting a 66,000-job loss. There have been more
than 500,000 jobs lost in that sector since January 1989.
   Construction also continued its slide in September, posting the
fourth decline in as many months as the weakness in the housing
market showed no signs of abating. Jobs in that sector have fallen
by more than 100,000 in recent months.
   The service-producing sector, which until a few months ago had
been enjoying robust job growth, actually lost 17,000 jobs in
September.
   Within the sector, the services industry itself, which employs
one in four non-farm workers, added only 20,000 jobs, one of the
smallest gains since the 1981-82 recession, Mrs. Norwood said.
   Labor costs, which are frequently blamed for worsening inflation
problems, rose a sharp 0.5 percent. The average hourly worker made
$10.13 an hour in September, up from $9.73 in September 1989.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the September
jobless rate was 5.6 percent, up from 5.5 percent in August.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Its Foes Have Brought World to Brink of War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Iraqi foreign minister's prepared
speech, State Department comment on next evacuation flight. TRIMS.
No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF DONN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today the United States and its allies have sent
forces to the Persian Gulf region because they hope to gain control
of the Middle East's oil supplies and that their plan has brought
the world to the brink of war.
   In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.N. General Assembly,
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, said the U.N. Security Council
was hypocritical when it penalized Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait
while allowing Israel to continue occupying Arab lands seized in
1967 and 1973 wars.
   He proposed that all Middle East problems - ``Palestine,
Lebanon, the gulf and others'' - be considered on the same basis.
   An Iraqi envoy was to read the Aziz speech to the General
Assembly this evening. A text of the speech was obtained in advance
by The Associated Press.
   Aziz did not come to New York to deliver the speech because the
United States denied landing rights for the plane the Iraqi
delegation has used in the past, proposing instead that Aziz take a
commercial flight.
   The foreign minister said in the speech that America and its
allies ``are seeking to gain control over the oil reserves in the
gulf so as to have a free hand in manipulating the needs of the
world, and especially the needs of the peoples of the Third World,
for this important commodity.''
   He accused Iraq's foes of deploying ``fleets, aircraft and
ground forces in the region in a way that has no parallel in
contemporary history, thus bringing the entire region, nay the
entire world, to the brink of a devastating war.''
   Also today, the State Department said 300 Americans and
foreign-born family members have signed up for an evacuation flight
due to leave Kuwait Wednesday.
   The passengers will arrive in North Carolina on Thursday after
an overnight stay in London, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
The flight will go from Baghdad to Kuwait and then back to Baghdad
before flying on to London.
   Boucher declined to say how many of the 300 are Americans.
   The flight will be the first U.S. government-sponsored charter
to evacuate Americans and their family members since Sept. 22.
About 1,900 Americans have left the two countries aboard these
flights since they were instituted a month ago. The large majority
have been women and children.
   The State Department said late last month that at least 900 U.S.
citizens remain trapped, including 600 to 700 in Kuwait and 300 to
350 in Iraq.
   In other developments:
   -A respected Western research institute says that if war breaks
out in the Persian Gulf, Iraq could survive for only weeks.
   -A newspaper reported today that Iraq has high-explosive devices
equal in power to small nuclear bombs.
   -A Soviet envoy carried a message from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
Iraq on Thursday, and Britain said it supports linking talks on the
Palestinian question to an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait.
   In London, the director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, Francois Heisbourg, said on Thursday that Iraq
``would not last terribly long'' if war broke out, several days or
only a few weeks.
   But at the same news conference, institute spokesman Andrew
Duncan said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would probably resort to
using chemical weapons on Western civilians because of problems
attacking well-protected and mobile U.S. troops in the gulf.
   Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times reported today that Iraq has
acquired explosives equal in power to small nuclear bombs, and it
said that has raised concerns that the United States has no ready
defense against the weapons.
   The fuel-air explosives, or FAEs, have 10 times the power of
conventional explosives and create a huge fireball and shock waves
over a concentrated area, without the radiation fallout associated
with nuclear weapons.
   Military officials say the explosives could devastate oil
fields, air bases and troops, the newspaper reported.
   ``It's not your garden-variety weapon,'' Henry Sokolski of the
Pentagon's international security affairs office told the
newspaper. ``These are blast-effect weapons, and what you can't see
can kill you.''
   The weapons can be launched as bombs from airplanes or as
warheads on missiles. Pentagon officials said U.S. forces would
have difficulty defending against a missile-delivered warhead, but
there is no clear evidence Iraq has the ability to mount the
explosives on missiles.
   Five senators have called on Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
launch an investigation into Iraq's supply of the weapons, which
the paper said Iraq apparently developed using scientific knowledge
from the German arms industry.
   Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to end the 2-month-old crisis
moved forward. Yevgeny Primakov, a senior adviser to Gorbachev,
arrived in Baghdad Thursday carrying an undisclosed message, Soviet
diplomatic sources said.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, quoted Primakov as saying
a negotiated solution was needed ``to avoid a military explosion.''
He planned to request that some of 5,000 Soviet citizens, most of
them oil industry workers, be allowed to leave Iraq, the diplomatic
sources said.
   Also Thursday, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain called
on Israel to be prepared to negotiate the Palestinian problem if
Iraq withdraws from Kuwait. In a U.N. speech Monday, President Bush
said an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could lead to opportunities
for a broad Middle East settlement.

   Prepared for the worst, an Energy
Department team equipped with millions of dollars worth of
radiation monitors staked out Kennedy Space Center for Saturday's
launch of a shuttle with a plutonium cargo.
   ``It would be irresponsible'' not to be ready in the event of an
accident, said Energy Department spokesman Dave Jackson.
   ``There is 23.7 pounds of plutonium in the space shuttle,''
Jackson said Friday. ``Even if there is an accident and no release,
we have to document the fact that there is no release ... and make
people understand there is no hazard.''
   About two-thirds of the 70-member team were to be standing by
with portable radiation monitors during the fueling of Discovery
late Friday and early Saturday, and during liftoff, scheduled for
Saturday morning.
   Energy Department officials also planned to have a plane
circling overhead at launch time to measure radiation in the air in
the event of a Challenger-like accident.
   The danger will linger for 7{ hours after liftoff, when the
plutonium-powered satellite is released for its five-year solar
journey. If one of the satellite's upper-stage engines fails, for
instance, the spacecraft and its plutonium generator could come
crashing through the atmosphere.
   The emergency team is prepared to rush anywhere in the world
that the generator might fall, Jackson said.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
say there is a less than one in 1 million chance of Discovery being
involved in an accident that would lead to a plutonium-related
death. So far, there have been three space accidents involving
plutonium generators, during the 1960s and early 1970s.
   About 20 anti-nuclear activists who say NASA is playing down the
danger demonstrated at the space center Friday morning.
   They stood along a highway leading to the center's main offices,
holding signs condemning NASA's use of plutonium as employees
streamed by in cars on their way to work. Some of the workers
shouted insults at the protesters.
   Two women, one of them an 81-year-old, were arrested when they
entered a restricted area with the intention of sitting on the
launch pad. They later were charged with trespassing.
   Armed security guards prevented reporters from approaching the
protesters, many of whom took part in a Sept. 22 demonstration that
attracted about 150 people.
   Concerned about NASA's recent spate of shuttle problems, an
environmental coalition asked a federal judge in Washington to
delay the launch for at least a year. The judge refused to do so
Friday, which came as no surprise to the protesters.
   The same judge, a year ago, denied a similar request and
Atlantis lifted off with a Jupiter probe containing twice as much
plutonium as the sun probe Ulysses. That launch, the first in which
a shuttle carried plutonium, drew a government radiation-monitoring
team of about 200 people, as well as many of the same protesters.
   Bruce Gagnon, the coalition's state coordinator, said the
demonstrations hopefully will persuade NASA to use solar panels
instead of plutonium generators on deep-space probes scheduled to
go up in the mid-1990s.
   ``All the excuses are gone now after this launch. They have five
to six years to develop a solar alternative,'' Gagnon said. ``It's
important that people come out and protest against these things,
whether we stop it today or not.''
   Neither Gagnon nor any of the other protesters planned to be
anywhere near Kennedy Space Center on launch day.

<HEAD>1991 Guinness Book Packed with 3,000 New Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guinness Book of Records, first published to
settle pub disputes and other friendly debates, issued its 1991
edition Friday with 3,000 new records, revealing the lengths people
will go to get their names in print.
   Englishman Dale Lyons ran 29.9 miles in four hours and 18
minutes - balancing a fresh egg in a dessert spoon. In cracking the
previous egg and spoon race record, Lyons gained a place in the
book.
   The Royal Army Ordinance Corps broke the round the world driving
record between May 13 and June 22, traveling 25,187.8 miles in 39
days, 23 hours and 35 minutes.
   ``There is a fascination with breaking a record. People like to
feel they can actually get their name in a book,'' said Cathy
Brooks, the spokeswoman for Guinness Publishing.
   The latest edition shows that Americans continue to pin their
shot at the big time on big food.
   Students and staff at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.,
froze out the competition in the Largest Popsicle category -
constructing one in February that weighed 7,080 pounds.
   Proving that silliness knows no frontiers, a crew of cooks at a
Pizza Hut in Singapore achieved its record by baking a pie
measuring 111 feet, 3 inches in diameter.
   Britain's Army Catering Corps of the Prince of Wales Own
Regiment of Yorkshire gave the world a record-breaking Yorkshire
pudding of 360 square feet.
   Asians took the opposite approach, achieving new world records
for smallness.
   Dipak Syal of Yamuna Nagar, India, won a record for minuscule
writing by inscribing ``I love you'' and ``I love you, too'' and
thn signing his initials ``D.S.'' on a single grain of rice in
May.
   His 813 characters beat the record of Pan Xixing of Wuxi, China,
who in March wrote ``True Friendship is like sound health, the
value of which is seldom known until it be lost'' on a human hair.
   ``Minuscule writing has proved very popular,'' Ms. Brooks said.
``We've been receiving massive packages from India all year. Our
editors open them up to find one grain of rice inside. The biggest
problem has been not losing the potential record breaker under a
desk.''
   Since the first Guinness Book of Records was published in
England in 1955, the fascination with setting records has spread as
the book made its way around the world.
   The first U.S. edition, published under the title Guinness Book
of World Records, appeared in 1956. French and German language
versions quickly followed.
   The book has been translated into Japanese, Spanish, Danish,
Norwegian, Dutch, Portuguese, Czech, Hebrew, Serbo-Croatian,
Icelandic, Slovenian, Greek, Indonesian, Chinese, Turkish, Hindi,
Malay, Arabic, Thai, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and
Hungarian.
   In 1990, the first Russian language edition was published.
   ``Now that we have a publishing partner in the Soviet Union, it
is possible to check and verify information in a way which has been
impossible in the past,'' said Donald McFarlan, editor of The
Guinness Book of Records.
   The international competition the book has sparked could not
have been envisioned by Sir Hugh Beaver on Nov. 10, 1951, the
fateful day his hunting party missed a flock of golden plover.
   Seeking a reason for the failure, Beaver searched a reference
book for proof that the golden plover was Britain's fastest game
bird.
   It isn't. The 1991 Guinness Book of Records lists the red grouse
as Britain's fastest bird.
   Finding no definitive reference book set Beaver to thinking. The
managing director of Guinness, the beer brewer, pictured unanswered
questions arising in debates in pubs throughout Britain.
   The Guinness Book of Records was born. In 1974, it earned its
own place in the record books as the top-selling copyright book in
publishing history, with sales of 23.9 million copies.
   In October, global sales surpassed 65 million, equivalent to 182
stacks each as high as Mount Everest.

   A judge gave the thumbs' up Friday
and NASA counted down toward a launch of the space shuttle
Discovery carrying the nuclear-powered Ulysses spacecraft.
   Two demonstrators opposed to Discovery's radioactive cargo were
arrested.
   Discovery was scheduled to blast off at 7:35 a.m. Saturday. Six
hours after launch, the five-man crew is supposed to release
Ulysses from the cargo hold.
   The satellite will then rocket itself out of Earth orbit for a
round-about voyage that eventually will take it around the sun to
study its so-far unexplored polar regions.
   NASA officials said Friday the countdown was going well. Fueling
of the shuttle, which includes a critical test of its liquid
hydrogen plumbing, was scheduled to begin about 11:15 p.m. EDT.
   Kennedy Space Center spokesman Dick Young said the mission would
be unaffected in the event of a shutdown of government agencies
because of the dispute over the federal budget. He said funds for
the mission had already been set aside and notices had gone out
that all employees were to report to work.
   ``The mood of the team is confident and that's despite
distractions and disappointments recently,'' said launch director
Robert B. Sieck. ``If the weather is good to us, we'll have some
good news'' on Saturday.
   For NASA, the news has been mostly bad since the last successful
shuttle launch in April. The agency has scrubbed four shuttle
launch attempts because of hydrogen fuel leaks and learned that
there is a serious flaw in the Hubble space telescope.
   Another problem was added to the list Thursday when workers
discovered that a 9-foot, 70-pound metal beam had been left in the
engine compartment of the shuttle Atlantis.
   When the craft was hoisted from a horizontal to a vertical
position, the beam clanked around inside the compartment, causing
up to 25 dents and dings. None of the damage was believed serious,
Sieck said, and Atlantis is still scheduled for a mission in
November.
   The beam is normally used to support a work platform used when
the shuttle is being processed on the ground.
   William Lenoir, boss of NASA's spaceflight program, said the
problems are isolated incidents and not signs of the agency's
decline.
   ``I don't see a common thread that connects the Hubble incident,
the hydrogen leaks, and the beam,'' Lenoir said at a news
conference.
   A group of 20 demonstrators gathered at a restricted entrance to
the space center Friday morning and protested Ulysses' nuclear
power supply. They milled around the gate, waving signs and calling
to space center employees driving in to work.
   Two women from the group were taken into custody after they
walked past a checkpoint into a restricted area. They were charged
with trespassing.
   In Washington, D.C., a judge rejected a petition by three
activist groups that sought to block Discovery's launch with its
nuclear-powered payload. They asked for more research into the
risks of the spread of radioactive materials should Discovery
explode during launch.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch rejected the contention, just
as he did for a similar claim filed last year before the launch of
Galileo, which also was nuclear powered.
   Ulysses is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator,
or RTG, which generates electricity from the heat of 23.7 pounds of
highly radioactive plutonium. The United States has used 22 RTGs on
earlier space missions, including five moon flights.
   NASA says the plutonium is housed in a module that has been
tested to withstand any probable accident. The agency estimated
that in the worst possible accident, there is only a 1-in-44
million chance of 14.5 cancer fatalities over 50 years.
   After Ulysses is released from Discovery, a two-stage rocket
will fire and send the European-built craft streaking toward
Jupiter. Ulysses will loop over Jupiter's north pole in 1992 and
the giant planet's intense gravity will give it a powerful burst of
speed and hurl it back toward the sun's south pole.
   In 1994, Ulysses will pass within 120 million miles of the sun's
south pole and about 18 months later it will pass over the solar
north pole.
   Discovery's commander is Richard N. Richards. The pilot will be
Robert D. Cabana. Others in the crew are William M. Shepherd, Bruce
Melnick, and Thomas D. Akers.

<HEAD>Vietnam Foreign Minister To Hold Talks In Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's foreign minister has accepted
an invitation for talks in Washington on humanitarian issues, the
Vietnamese state radio said.
   Nguyen Co Thach will hold talks with Gen. John W. Vessey, a
special U.S. presidential envoy, at the invitation of Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, the broadcast said. No date was given.
   It said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan made the
announcement at a news conference in Hanoi on Thursday. A text of
the broadcast was seen in Bangkok on Friday.
   Vessey has been a chief negotiator on humanitarian issues with
Vietnam, including the efforts to account for about 2,300 Americans
reported missing in action - or MIA - during the Vietnam War.
   Vessey met with Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai in New
York on Sept. 20, and later reported that the Vietnamese wanted to
speed up cooperation on the MIA issue. The resettlement of
Vietnamese refugees and migrants in the United States has been the
other major humanitarian issue between the two countries.
   The United States says it will not establish diplomatic
relations with Vietnam until the end of the Cambodian civil war,
which was sparked by Vietnamese invasion. But Washington has
shifted to a more flexible position in recent months, and on Aug. 6
held its first talks with Vietnam on peace efforts in Cambodia.

   The Soviet news agency Tass will open a news

two countries continue to improve.
   The exact location of the Tass office - Jerusalem or Tel Aviv -
has not been decided, said Tatyana Kitayeva of the news agency's

   The bureau chief will be Alexander A. Zhurdo, she said in a

   At a United Nations meeting on Sunday, the Soviet Union and
Israel announced plans to open consulates in each other's
countries, a major step in restoring relations that were cut after
the 1967 Middle East War.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Israel would
open a consulate general - the highest level consulate - in Moscow,
and the Soviets would open a consulate general in Tel Aviv.
   It also has been announced that direct airline flights between
the Soviet Union and Israel would begin within a month. Such
flights could accelerate the exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel, which
already is straining to accommodate more than 100,000 Soviet
emigres who arrived since last year.

<TEXT>
   The Yanomami Indians, the largest
known primitive tribe in existence, may be changing from a nomadic
to a stable community, two leading scientists said Friday.
   Some groups in the tribe - which inhabits the tropical Amazon
rain forest along Venezuela's border with Brazil - are also
experiencing a population growth equal to about 2 percent a year,
they said.
   Charles Brewer-Carias, a Venezuelan naturalist, said the
population growth coupled with a change in cultivation habits were
basic conditions for transition to a stable community.
   Brewer-Carias and Napoleon A. Chagnon, an anthropology professor
at the University of California at Santa Barbara, led a 40-day
expedition that in recent weeks contacted four Yanomami groups.
   About 14,000 Yanomamis inhabit the Venezuelan Amazon and 9,000
live across the border in the Brazilian rainforest, scientists say.
   It is believed the Yanomamis migrated from the Caribbean region
thousands of years ago. Because they burn their dead and drink a
solution of the ashes, evidence of them is hard to trace.
   The Yanomamis hunt with poisoned arrows and many use primitive
tools. They shun clothes, decorate their bodies with fruit dye and
flowers and live under huge palm huts in small communities.
   The Yanomami are the largest tribe with little or no contact
with the modern world.
   The Yanomami groups are based on parental ties. But once they
reach a number of 200 to 250, parental relationship weakens among
Yanomami and they apparently split forming a new group that settles
elsewhere, scientists say.
   Chagnon, who has studied the Yanomami Indians for 25 years, said
his conclusions on population growth among the Venezuelan groups
come from studies on the reproduction of Yanomami women from
different villages.
   On the Brazilian side of the border the Yanomamis haven't been
as lucky, suffering at the hands of gold prospectors, who have
brought disease and chemicals to the primitive communities.
   Speaking from California, Chagnon said he also has collected
data on settlement and migration. He said most existing Yanomami
villages emerged from a single village between 120 and 150 years
ago, and then scattered.
   The original village had a population of no more than 300. Their
descendents dispersed over 12 villages and now number over 2,000.
   ``They increased more than six-fold during the past 120-150
years. By demographic standards, that is a very high rate of
expansion. It would be a high rate even if it were half of this,''
he said.
   Chagnon and Brewer-Carias are co-directing a project to study
the Yanomami and other Indian cultures over the next 10 years.
   The recent expedition, which covered the High Siapa River basin
near the Brazilian border, was supported by the University of
California and Fundafaci, a private Venezuelan foundation.
   Brewer-Carias said the expedition found evidence that new
splinter groups were spreading over the Brazilian-Venezuelan
border. Some have shifted cultivations from banana to manioc.
   ``It seems they are experimenting with new staples,''
Brewer-Carias said.
   It took nine hours of helicopter flight before the expedition
found and contacted the first Yanomami group ``still untouched and
up to that moment totally isolated from our culture,''
Brewer-Carias said.
   In Brazil the Yanomamis have been pushed deep into the jungle by
gold prospectors, who have invaded their lands seeking gold and
diamonds. About 3,000 have died over the past three years, most
from exposure to disease.
   Because of their isolation, the Indians have no immunity against
common viruses and can easily die from flu or cold.

<HEAD>Princess Diana Visits 3-Year-Old `First Lady' With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Diana visited two first ladies Friday
- one who lives in the White House and another, only three years
old, who is infected with the AIDS virus.
   The younger ``first lady'' earned her nickname because she was
the first child placed at Grandma's House, a home for children with
the deadly virus.
   The little girl, dressed in bright pink overalls for the
occasion, grabbed Diana's hand when they were introduced. The
princess scooped her up, carried her upstairs during a tour of the
Victorian row house, and readily agreed when she asked to ride
around the block in Diana's dark green Rolls Royce.
   As cameras flashed and whirred, the princess stepped out of the
car with ``the first lady'' in her arms - a symbolic picture that
gratified the founders of Grandma's House, who have kept its
location unpublicized out of concern about prejudice and fear.
   ``That kind of picture... a person of her stature coming...''
said the Rev. Debbie Tate, president of a crisis housing
organization that runs Grandma's House. ``It shows that it's all
right to love a person with AIDS, it's all right to care about a
person with AIDS, it's all right to hug a person with AIDS... It
won't hurt you.''
   Tate said the little girl had not been diagnosed yet with
full-fledged AIDS, but the virus was progressing. Once that
diagnosis is made, she said through tears, ``the first lady'' could
be expected to live about a year.
   Diana's whirlwind trip, her second solo visit to the United
States, ended less than 24 hours after she arrived in the country.
   She attended a gala Thursday night to benefit Grandma's House
and ballet companien Washington and London, and had coffee
Friday morning at the White House with Barbara Bush and others
before her motorcade went to the children's residence.
   President Bush appeared for the last 10 or 15 minutes of the
35-minute White House meeting, according to British Embassy
spokesman Francis Cornish. He said Bush congratulated Diana on her
work and compared her causes to those he honors with his ``thousand
points of light'' program.
   Diana, wearing a dusty pink suit with purple trim and matching
purple pumps, knelt down on the floor of the Grandma's House
playroom to get closer to the children there.
   ``Aren't you excited we have the princess with us today,''' a
man said to the children. Diana was said to have blushed and
murmured, ``Don't put it that way.''
   The princess concluded her visit by cutting a red ribbon to open
Grandpa's House, a nearby house that will double the program's
capacity from six to 12 children. The brief ceremony was witnessed
by Mayor Marion Barry and his wife, Effi. Diana strode across the
street to shake hands with well-wishers, creating an instant
commotion, and then she was gone.
   ``It touched my heart. She was very, very warm, very much a
caring person for the children,'' said Joan McCarley, Tate's sister
and the executive director of Grandma's House.
   McCarley said the money raised by the gala - more than $100,000
- also meant a lot to her small operation. ``It will open other
doors'' for the abused, fragile and neglected children who need the
home's refuge, she said.
   Still, the gala, with its $2,500 minimum ticket prices that
jumped to $3,500 for those who wanted to shake Diana's hand, was a
sore point of the short royal visit. Several prominent U.S.
organizers did not attend, and one even asked for her money back.
   Cornish said the princess was aware of the controversy, but said
he did not know what she thought of the ticket prices. He added,
``You can't wander into somebody else's country and say something's
too steep.''

   A health food store clerk who sang
the national anthem to Sinead O'Connor from behind the meat counter
got the ax after the Irish pop singer complained.
   Ms. O'Connor refused to perform at a New Jersey concert this
summer if the ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was played. She has let
it be known that she objects to any national anthems being played
at her concerts, even the Irish anthem.
   The singer is also known for her nearly shaved head and her hit
``Nothing Compares 2 U.''
   Former meat clerk Mike Rechtien said that on Tuesday, Ms.
O'Connor entered Mrs. Gooch's Natural Food Market.
   When she approached the counter, he said he told her, ``I have a
song for you.''
   With that, Rechtien, a struggling musician, launched into ``Oh
say, can you see ... ''
   According to her publicist, Ms. O'Connor asked the store not to
punish Rechtien.
   But store officials said Rechtien was fired from his job because
``the store maintains a strict policy on harassment of any kind
including verbal, physical or visual.'' He worked there six weeks.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A critic of Mayor Bill Boner, known for
his romantic affairs as well as his politics, said she would turn
down a chance to confront the mayor on national television because
she's afraid he will embarrass Nashville.
   Newlywed Boner and his fourth wife, aspiring country singer
Traci Peel, are to appear on Phil Donahue's nationally syndicated
talk show this month.
   Jo Ann North, a city councilwoman and critic of Boner, was
invited to appear on the same show, but says she'll decline.
   North fears Boner will only embarrass his hometown, which has
been trying to polish its image to attract a National League
baseball franchise.
   ``If I thought I would have an opportunity to talk about all the
wonderful things in Nashville and promote Nashville, I'd do it in a
heartbeat,'' North said. ``The only good thing that can come out of
this is the promotion of Traci Peel's career.''
   Boner and Peel married Monday in Hawaii. They began dating while
he lived with his third wife. Their affair gained wide attention
after a reporter called the couple one evening and Peel commented
that the mayor's passion could last seven hours.
   Bumper stickers soon appeared, proclaiming: ``Seven hours for
Traci, three years for Nashville.''
   A Nashville car dealer offered to pay Boner's $75,000 salary if
the mayor would resign before his term ends next year, but Boner
angrily rejected the offer.

   LONDON (AP) - Writing made Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy famous
but the family talent has proved costly for one of his descendants,
historian Count Nikolai Tolstoy.
   Last year, the High Court in London ordered Tolstoy, 55, to pay
a record $2.8 million in damages for writing a pamphlet in which he
called Count Aldington, a 76-year-old World War II veteran, a war
criminal.
   Now that libel judgment has forced Tolstoy into bankruptcy, he
said.
   The pamphlet said that in May 1945, when he was army Brig. Toby
Low, Aldington handed over 70,000 anti-Soviet Russian Cossacks and
anti-Communist Yugoslavs to the Soviet Army and Marshal Josip Broz
Tito, knowing they would be tortured and killed.
   Aldington testified at the libel trial that he believed
assurances from the Soviets and Tito that the prisoners would be
lawfully tried. He said the jury's ruling vindicated his
reputation.

<HEAD>Cuomo Spends $2.3 Million In Less Than Three Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, seeking re-election to a
third term, has spent almost $2.3 million in less than three months
and still has almost $6.1 million in the bank, his campaign
committee reported Friday.
   Comparable figures for Republican challenger Pierre Rinfret
weren't immediately available.
   Two weeks ago, Rinfret said his campaign was broke and he
threatened to quit the race unless Republican leaders came up with
money for him. He has since said his campaign fund-raising has
improved and that he won't quit the race.
   A recent statewide poll, conducted by the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion, found that 60 percent of those
surveyed favored Cuomo while less than 15 percent opted for
Rinfret.
   While the cash-rich Cuomo campaign has held no major fund
raisers since its July 15 filing with the state Board of Elections,
it still managed to raise $625,871 since then, according to records
filed with the state Board of Elections. That includes more than
$279,000 in interest payments on the money the Cuomo committee
already had in the bank.

   State Rep. Bob Neuenschwander
says he won't conduct a write-in campaign because of voter apathy,
the deer season and his hard-to-spell last name.
   The four-term lawmaker lost to former House Majority Leader Irv
Anderson in the Sept. 11 Democratic primary.
   ``I feel confident that, if my name were on the ballot in
November, I could win by 1,500 votes,'' said Neuenschwander. ``But
to wage a write-in campaign with a name like Neuenschwander and to
overcome voter apathy by urging a sticker campaign with the
election just four days after the deer season opener is just not in
the cards.''
   He said he had considerable support if he had mounted a write-in
campaign.
   ``I had one group that called that said they had been practicing
writing my name,'' he said. ``One lady told me that after 15
minutes of practicing, she still hadn't got it right.''

<HEAD>Candidate's Wife Says Safety Was Motive For Taking Down Opponent's
Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of Republican congressional
candidate Dick Waterfield says her motivation for tearing down
campaign posters belonging to her husband's opponent was safety,
not politics.
   Gail Waterfield was spotted by Hartley County Sheriff Johnny
Williams Thursday morning in a Waterfield for Congress campaign car
tearing a poster for Bill Sarpalius poster from a utility pole.
   When asked what she was doing, Mrs. Waterfield told Williams she
was pulling the posters because they were posted illegally on
telephone poles, the Amarillo Globe-News reported.
   Sarpalius, a Democrat, is the incumbent and he faces Waterfield
in the November election.
   Waterfield spokesman David Crowder brushed aside as
``ridiculous'' assertions that the removal of the Sarpalius
election posters was politically motivated. Mrs. Waterfield took
down the signs, he said, for safety reasons.
   ``Signs placed on utility poles are illegal regardless of
whether they're campaign or otherwise. Signs on utility poles pose
problems for the individuals that service utility poles,'' Crowder
said.
   Sarpalius spokesman Robert Hinkle, who speculated the signs were
posted by supporters, said he was stunned to learn it was
Waterfield's wife removing their signs.
   ``Gail may be more anxious about going to Washington than Dick
is,'' Hinkle said. ``If you believe she was ripping them down
because it was unsafe, I've got some property ... to sell you.''
   James Hoard, spokesman for Southwestern Public Service Co., said
late Thursday that posting signs on power poles is illegal in most
cities, but he wasn't sure what the law was in the outlying areas.

<HEAD>Hunt Campaign Pulls Ad With Hubbert's Name Misspelled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Guy Hunt, whose recent television
ads have focused on teacher competency, pulled one commercial after
his campaign staff discovered his opponent's name was misspelled.
   The Hunt campaign sent a new series of ads to TV stations late
last week. But on Sunday, the campaign notified stations that one
of the ads was not to be run until a replacement could be sent. The
reason was that Hubbert's name was spelled ``Hubbard.''
   ``It was done in production in Washington,'' Hunt campaign
spokesman Terry Abbott said. ``The ad was scrapped before it ever
went on the air.''
   Abbott said he understood the ad with the typographical error
might have run in some TV markets, but if so, it was against the
campaign's instructions.
   Hunt's new ads blame Hubbert for Alabama not testing its new
teachers and link him with Bill Baxley, the 1986 Democratic
gubernatorial nominee, and Joe Reed, the black political leader who
is Hubbert's associate at the Alabama Education Association.

   Germany's new Parliament on Friday ratified
an international treaty that grants full sovereignty to the nation,
formally ending 45 years of special rights by the World War II
Allies.
   Parliament also rescued plans for nationwide elections Dec. 2 by
approving a new balloting law - the first time former East German
lawmakers cast parliamentary votes alongside colleagues from the
West.
   Some eastern newcomers seemed moved by the occasion, which came
two days after East Germany and West Germany became one.
   ``I'm awed that I - from Mecklenburg - am permitted to speak to
an all-German Parliament,'' said Conrad-Michael Lehment, a resident
of that former East German city and a member of the Free Democrats.
   The 144 eastern lawmakers, joining 519 representatives from the
west, crowded into the Bundestag, a humble structure that once
housed part of Bonn's water system.
   ``I warmly welcome you to the waterworks,'' parliamentary
president Rita Suessmuth joked to the new lawmakers.
   On Thursday, the first all-German Parliament since 1933 held a
symbolic session in Berlin, capital of the new nation. Bonn is
Germany's seat of Parliament.
   The new 663-member Parliament's approval formally ends special
rights conferred on the United States, the Soviet Union, France and
Britain after the Allies defeated and divided Nazi Germany in World
War II.
   Under the rights, the Allied powers controlled transit between
sectors of Berlin and could veto any laws in the city. They also
prohibited the West German carrier Lufthansa from flying to Berlin,
because its planes would have had to fly over what was then East
Germany.
   The treaty was already signed in Moscow on Sept. 12 by West and
East Germany and the four Allies.
   A broad majority of government and opposition lawmakers approved
the new election law by a simple show of hands. The legislation
replaces an election treaty that was rejected by the Supreme Court
on Sept. 29. The court said the old treaty gave unfair treatement
to small parties.
   The overruled treaty would have required a party to win 5
percent of the vote across Germany to earn a seat in the Bundestag.
   The new law in effect sets up two separate election areas in the
united Germany. Lawmakers in former East Germany will have to
receive 5 percent on their own turf, rather than polling that
amount across the united country.
   That will give smaller partes like the Party for Democratic
Socialism - East Germany's renamed Communists - a better chance of
winning parliamentary seats.
   However, the Democratic Socialists voted against the new plan,
saying it opposes any minimum vote for winning parliamentary seats.
Such a system, said party leader Gregor Gysi, ``manipulates the
will of the voters.''
   Parliamentarians needed to quickly come to agreement on an
election law so the vote could be held as scheduled Dec. 2.
   The united Parliament's first working session was relatively
civil, but accusations flew nonetheless.
   Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, from the West German branch of the
opposition Social Democrats, charged that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
unity policies had created ``concern, fears and discontent'' among
East Germans.
   Despair is rising on former East German territory because of
rising unemployment resulting from the rough transition from four
decades of communism into capitalism.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel presented a new supplementary
budget to the lawmakers that would raise federal borrowing this
year by $17 billion.
   Most of the borrowed money would be used to create new jobs and
housing and to bolster pensions and social welfare payments in the
eastern part of Germany.
   Also during the parliamentary session, former Communists and
other leftists joined with the Social Democrats in calling for
further disarmament in united Germany.
   Horst Ehmke, a security expert for the Social Democrats, said
all nuclear weapons should be removed from Germany.
   Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, from the Party for Democratic Socialism,
said Germany should scrap compulsory military service.

   Lawmakers from now-extinguished East
Germany were in town Friday, dismayed by Bonn's steep hotel prices
and eager to move into offices hastily being furnished.
   Some offices for legislators from the former Communist Party
were ready in what was once a kindergarten, located near the
Parliament building. Lawmakers from other parties were also moving
into new rooms.
   But they were shocked at prices in Bonn, the parliamentary seat
of united Germany. Asked how he found his hotel, Wolfgang Thierse
of the Social Democratic Party said:``Very expensive. I have never
before in my life slept for 215 marks ($140) a night.''
   ``You're not there long enough to get your money's worth,''
Thierse said.
   At the offices of the former Communist Party, now called the
Party of Democratic Socialism, lawmaker Sabine Fache was busy
setting up her office after attending Friday's Parliament session.
   ``We had a good flight from Berlin. It was a Lufthansa flight
late last night. That was a first,'' Ms. Fache said, laughing.
   The four World War II allies prohibited Lufthansa, the national
airline, from flying between West Germany and Berlin because its
planes would have had to fly over East German territory. That
changed with German unity.
   Missing in Bonn from the 23 Democratic Socialist deputies was
former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow, on a visit to Japan.
Virtually all of the other 144 Parliament members from the East
made the trip West to Bonn.
   After being driven past Parliament buildings, the newcomers were
split among several hotels in the city, Ms. Fache said.
   ``Ours was a little hotel on the outskirts. We weren't too happy
because there was no restaurant open. We ended up going to a little
pizza place about 11 p.m.,'' Ms. Fache said.
   Bonn, a sleepy city along the Rhine, is notorious for closing
down early, unlike the bustling metropolis of Berlin.
   But Social Democratic Party delegates said they had expected
more distance from some of Bonn's deputies, Ms. Fache said.
   ``But it wasn't like that. They gave us tips on what to do, they
were friendly. We were surprised. Maybe they still see us as
exotic,'' she said.
   Ms. Fache is a Social Democratic Party candidate for the Dec. 2
elections from Altenburg, 150 miles south of Berlin.
   New parliamentarians from other parties, many of whom arrived on
the same Lufthansa flight, were also scattered among various Bonn
hotels.
   Most were eager to get down to business.
   ``I really can't talk about my feelings,'' said former East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere and now a member of the
Bonn Cabinet. ``I just want to get down to work.''
   And he meant it - the soft-spoken politician was the first
member to arrive for Friday morning's Cabinet meeting.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Legislation To Give Trade Benefits To Andes Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday proposed legislation
to give a decade of preferable trade benefits to Peru, Colombia,
Ecuador and Bolivia in thanks for their cooperation in the war
against drugs.
   The Andean Trade Preference Act is patterned after the Caribbean
Basin Initiative that gives special trade benefits to Caribbean
nations.
   The Andean proposal Bush sent to Congress also addresses the
long festering trade dispute with Colombia over cut flowers, by
making them duty free.
   It would authorize duty free treatment for 10 years for some
imports from the countries along the Andean mountains, which also
are the principle source and production countries for the cocaine
trade.
   Products ``particularly sensitive to import competition'' will
not be duty free, the White House said. Those products include,
textiles and apparel, canned tuna, petroleum products, watches and
watch parts. Luggage, leather apparel and flat goods will still be
dutiable but under a duty reduction program.
   The administration is trying to provide economic incentives and
assistance to South American countries that have suffered in
cracking down on lucrative drug industries that greatly buttress
their poor economies.
   ``The idea behind this legislation is to give the countries an
extra boost ... by providing a special 10-year access to the
American market,'' Bush said as he signed the transmittal to
Congress.
   The trade measure is a follow up to the drug summit meeting Bush
held with the presidents of Peru, Bolivia and Colombia in
Cartagena, Colombia. He promised to work on expanding economic
opportunities for countries that cooperate with U.S. efforts to
interdict drugs and halt production of illicit narcotics.
   Enactment of the measure, Bush said in a letter to Congress,
``will permit the United States to support the efforts of the
Andean countries to eliminate the production, processing and
shipment of illicit drugs.''
   Bush had promised Colombia's President Cesar Gaviria when they
met at the United Nations on Saturday that he would seek special
trade benefits for Colombia including removal of tariffs on
flowers, the country's second biggest export after coffee.
   Colombia exports 80 percent of its flower crop to the United
States.
   The administration, responding to complaints from American
growers, had accused Colombia of ``dumping'' cut flowers in this
country at unreasonably low prices and had sharply increased
tariffs on Colombian flowers.

   The teen-age son of a cult leader was
sentenced Friday to a minimum 120 years in prison for helping to
kill four members of a family, crimes he blamed on his father.
   Damon Lundgren, 19, stood with folded hands and appeared calm as
Lake County Common Pleas Judge Paul H. Mitrovich sentenced him for
his role in the deaths of Dennis Avery and Avery's three daughters.
He was acquitted in the death of Avery's wife, Cheryl.
   The Averys belonged to the religious cult headed by Damon's
father, Jeffrey Lundgren. The Averys were led, one by one, into a
barn on April 17, 1989, bound and gagged with duct tape, then shot
and dumped in a common grave.
   Damon Lundgren received consecutive sentences of 20 years to
life for each of four counts of aggravated murder, and consecutive
sentences of 10 to 25 years on each of four counts of kidnapping.
   He would not be eligible for parole for at least 80 years.
   Defense lawyers said they would seek a new trial.
   Mitrovich chastised Damon Lundgren for not accepting
responsibility.
   ``You accept no blame. You blame your father. You claim this was
your father's doing and none of your own,'' the judge said.
   ``Jeffrey Lundgren could not have done anything without the help
and devotion of you and his other followers. Society cannot
tolerate such excuses,'' he said.
   The teen-ager was the last of his family sentenced in the case.
His father received a death sentence. His mother, Alice Lundgren,
was sentenced to five life terms for conspiracy, complicity and
kidnapping.
   Friends of Damon Lundgren's sat in the court gallery and wept as
he was sentenced. Tey had offered a petition bearing 514
signatures of people asking that he receive the minimum sentence of
life with chance of parole after 20 years.
   ``I know the kind of person he is,'' said former classmate Jim
Ford, 19.
   ``I know the kind of person his dad is, and I feel his dad had
everything to do with the cult and the killings,'' Ford said, ``and
he was a very overpowering person, and Damon was the type of person
who could be pulled into someone who could lead him around.''
   The Averys were killed at a farm the cult rented at Kirtland,
about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Authorities found the bodies Jan.
4.
   Thirteen cult members were subsequently arrested. Some have
pleaded guilty to reduced charges.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, was defrocked as a lay minister of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints before
forming his cult.
   He said he considered himself a prophet of God and received
instructions to kill the Aveys through interpretation of
Scriptures.
   Defense lawyers argued that Damon Lundgren was so strictly
raised and controlled by his father that he was unable to disobey
orders to help wrestle Dennis Avery to the ground and help bind and
gag him.

<HEAD>NRA Enlists In Program On Safe Use Of Firearms In National Forests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association has enlisted in
a program to encourage conservation and the safe use of firearms in
national forests, the Agriculture Department said today.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said the
agency's long-term plans are ``to improve wildlife habitat and
recreation opportunities'' and that he is pleased to have the NRA
as ``a partner in this important effort.''
   Robertson said both share an interest in promoting safe firearms
use and reducing vandalism on public lands.
   J. Warren Cassidy, NRA executive vice president, said much of
the group's effort will involve local affiliates working directly
with Forest Service managers on individual national forests and
grasslands.
   The Forest Service said activities to be developed by the agency
and NRA affiliates will vary widely.
   For example, the agency said the NRA and the National Wild
Turkey Federation are cooperating this weekend in a two-day camp
for about 100 youths in the George Washington National Forest in
Virginia.
   The camp, for youngsters under 16, is being held to teach
hunting ethics and firearm safety, the agency said.

   Fear of a voter revolt outweighed fear of
President Bush or House leaders when lawmakers defeated the $500
billion budget package.
   ``It was the combination of tax increases and spending cuts,
coming one month before an election'' that doomed the plan, said
Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill. No amount of economic theory, or
reasoning, or leadership pressure could overcome that, he said.
   ``The point is, we can't get whipped into line,'' added Rep.
Mickey Edwards, R-Okla. ``The public really spoke out on this.''
   Bush, trying to emulate the success of President Reagan, tried
to boost the package by going on national television Tuesday night
and asking voters to call their congressmen.
   They did - 8 to 1 against the deal in Edwards' office. Other
lawmakers reported similar results.
   And in the days leading up to the vote, the White House tacitly
admitted that a vote for the plan was politically stupid.
   House members running for the Senate or for governor were immune
from the lobbying. ``All of us statewide candidates got a bye,''
said Rep. John Rowland, R-Ct., who is running for governor.
   All eight GOP House members running for the Senate voted against
the president and are bragging about it back home. Likewise, the
Democrat and two Republicans running for governor opposed the
measure.
   Of 33 members of both parties running in tight re-election
races, only two voted for the package. In at least one case, an
endangered GOP incumbent offered his leaders his vote and they told
him to vote ``no.''
   For the bulk of the House, Bush's pleas for the good of the
economy, long-term gain, and lower interest rates paled against the
calls of voters staring at gas tax increases and higher Medicare
bills.
   The voters won, hands down.
   The president wasn't the only one who demonstrated a lack of
clout.
   Bush enlisted former presidents Reagan, Ford and Nixon in his
lobbying campaign, and Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater,
ill with cancer, sent a letter.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., usually can count at
least on the Massachusetts Democrats to support a party position.
But that state is practically defining voter anti-incumbent
feelings these days, and all but one of the ten voted against him.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., persuaded only three
of the other seven Illinois Republicans to go along.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., couldn't
even squeeze a vote out of his three housemates: Reps. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., Marty Russo, D-Ill., and George Miller, D-Calif.
   Of the congressional leadership, only Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., seemed to carry any weight. With Dole strongly behind
it, the entire Kansas delegation voted for the plan despite its $13
billion cut in agriculture spending.

   Five senators Friday called for a Pentagon
investigation of how Iraq might have obtained the technology to
make fuel-air explosives for extremely powerful bombs that can
spread their blast over a wide area.
   The senators are concerned that a German company,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, may have given away the formulas
needed to make the explosives.
   These weapons, used by U.S. forces in Vietnam, atomize liquid
fuel like propane into a widely spread fine mist, and then ignite
it. They are highly effective against troops in the open but not
very useful against hardened targets like fortifications.
   One expert, Jann Nolan of the Brookings Institution, called them
``highly overrated.''
   ``It is vita that an immediate and full investigation be made
of what technology was transferred to Iraq and by whom,'' stated
the letter to Defense Secretary Richard Cheney from Sens. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., Alan Dixon, D-Ill., Connie Mack, R-Fla., John Heinz,
R-Pa., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The senators said that the German concern, a subsidiary of
Mercedes-Benz and the country's largest aerospace firm, could have
transferred the bomb technology while working on the
Egyptian-Iraqi-Argentine Condor 2 ballistic missile program in the
mid-1980s.
   The Pentagon sought to play down any fears over the weapon
itself, and said it had no evidence that Iraqi fuel-air explosives
had come from a U.S. technology leak through Messerschmitt or any
other company or country.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, China, France, West
Germany, Spain and Israel all have the weapons, a Defense
Department spokesman said. ``This is old technology. It's not
unique or advanced.''
   Helms has been a persistent critic of Western defense
contractors, particularly those in Germany, who have allegedly sold
weapons to potential adversaries of the United States.
   A congressional source said that Iraq is able to use the weapons
either as bombs dropped from an airplane or as warheads on
missiles. The missile threat is seen as the greater menace to U.S.
and allied troops in Saudi Arabia, because allied defenses against
aircraft are excellent, the source said.
   This source spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   Henry Sokolski, an assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs, told the Los Angeles Times that
officials are concerned because a fuel-air bomb or warhead is ``not
your garden-variety weapon. These are blast-effect weapons, and
what you can't see can kill you.''
   A Pentagon official said Friday that Sokolski ``is not taking
press calls.''

<HEAD>Night Football Canceled in Parts of Florida Due to Mosquito-Borne
Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some high schools canceled Friday night
football games because encephalitis spread by night-flying
mosquitos has been confirmed in 12 Florida counties and a growing
number of people are presumed to have the virus.
   Health officials urged Floridians to wear protective long-sleeve
clothing and load up on bug repellent when they are outdoors at
night.
   Weary mosquito control fighters in Hillsborough County alone
logged 250 calls in one day from frightened homeowners wanting them
to spray or identify bugs and from northerners concerned about
coming to Florida.
   The state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
confirmed 28 cases of the St. Louis strain of encephalitis and
listed 10 more as presumed cases as of midday Friday - all in
central and southern Florida.
   ``Where it goes from here is anybody's guess,'' said Ernie
Durfee, HRS spokesman.
   Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain that causes fever,
sore throat, headaches, confusion and muscular weakness. In severe
cases of this incurable disease, it causes convulsions, coma and
death. The St. Louis strain of the disease is named for the city
where it was discovered in 1933.
   ``Many people who get infected may not have a disease they can
recognize as being caused by that virus,'' Dr. Thomas Hoffman of
the University of Miami medical school said. ``The most important
thing is precaution - precaution against insect bites.''
   Hardest hit since the first case was discovered in August has
been the state's central Atlantic coast. Indian River has 10 cases
and three more presumed cases, and Orange County - home to the
state's biggest tourist attractions - has three confirmed and
another person presumed to have it.
   Fifteen people are hospitalized and two - both over age 55 - are
comatose, health officials said.
   ``We watched the epidemic unfold in front of us, right from the
beginning until today. And we feel that possibly the worst part of
the epidemic may still be ahead,'' said Jonathan Day, an
entomologist with the University of Florida's Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences
   The season for transmission of the virus typically runs until
mid-December. As mosquitoes continue to breed and bite, the disease
can be expected to spread with them, Day said.
   ``If we get a cold snap it will kill them. It's all up to Mother
Nature,'' Durfee said.
   Very few mosquitoes actually are carriers, said Durfee.
   He said the disease is cyclical, occurring every 10 to 15 years
because of a combination of factors such as rainfall and mosquito
hatchings.
   The St. Louis strain last surfaced in Florida 13 years ago with
110 cases confirmed and eight deaths attributed to it.
   Durfee said infants and those over 55 are most susceptible
because babies have undeveloped immune systems and older people
have depressed immune systems.
   School boards in Polk and St. Lucie counties decided all school
activities, including high school football games, will be
rescheduled to end before dark. In Manatee County, Southeast High
School switched its junior varsity football game from Thursday
night until Monday afternoon.
   Counties stepped up truck and aerial spraying.
   ``We have a $1 million budget and a county with more than
800,000 people,'' said Dough Wassmer of Hillsborough Mosquito
Control. ``That amounts to about a can of Raid for each family.''
   He said the 21 workers were putting in more than 60 hours a week
to cover 1,020 square miles.
   ``We had a call from Pittsburgh asking if it was safe to come
down and another from Rhode Island asking about a trip to visit a
relative,'' Wassmer said.
   ``We tell them we have 800,000 residents in Hillsborough County
and to our knowledge two are reported sick. That's pretty low
odds.''

<HEAD>Yugoslav Army Seizes Regional Defense Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army took over the headquarters
of Slovenia's regional defense forces Friday, raising speculation
the government was reasserting its authority in the rebellious
northern republic.
   The army seizure led to protests by about 200 people who
gathered outside the building. Slovenian policemen also rushed to
surround the headquarters and other buildings in the capital,
apparently to prevent further army movements.
   The army, meanwhile, sought to play down the takeover, saying in
a statement broadcast on state radio that the military had not
occupied the headquarters but were only ``securing the building in
accordance with regulations.''
   ``There was no violence and there are no dangers for anyone,''
Jelko Kacin, Slovenia's deputy defense minister, said in a
telephone interview. State radio reported the protesters dispersed
peacefully.
   On Thursday, Slovenia's parliament proposed a plebiscite on
independence from Yugoslavia and declared 30 federal laws
incompatible with the republic's newly drafted constitution.
Slovenia's moves for independence, and recent clashes between
Yugoslavia's two biggest ethnic groups, the Serbians and Croatians,
have strained the unity of the 72-year-old nation.
   Slovenia is one of six republics that form Yugoslavia. Serbia is
the largest republic and Croatia is second-largest.
   According to Slovenian radio, 16 military police officers drove
up to Slovenia's home guard building in downtown Ljubljana during
the night and took over the headquarters peacefully. It said 30
civilian employees were permitted to leave the building.
   Slovenia's government, which advocates turning Yugoslavia into a
loose confederation of sovereign states, issued a statement
protesting the action and called it a ``provocation aimed at
inciting ... conflicts.''
   But the Slovenian authorities also said the headquarters
building, which belongs to the federal government, had been
evacuated by the territorial defense forces on Thursday.
   Last week, the Slovenian defense forces took over the local
militia, sacking an army general and replacing a dozen other
territorial army officers loyal to Belgrade.
   Yugoslavia on Tuesday ordered the army to reassert control over
the reservist defense force. Home guard forces were formed from
local inhabitants in all six Yugoslav republics in the late 1960s.
   One Western diplomat in Belgrade described the army action
Friday as ``symbolic.''
   ``Now the army can say they fulfilled the ... order to take
control of the territorial defense and the Slovenes can say they
still command their own home guard,'' said a Western diplomat in
Belgrade, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   A jury on Friday acquitted an art gallery and
its director of obscenity charges for exhibiting sexually graphic
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts Center, smiled
as the verdict was read. Spectators in the courtroom shouted and
applauded, and Barrie hugged his lawyers.
   In the nation's first obscenity trial of an art institution, the
gallery and Barrie were acquitted of misdemeanor charges of
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
Barrie could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined
$2,000, and the gallery fined $10,000, if convicted of both counts.
   In closing arguments, the prosecutor said the sexually graphic
photographs were convincing evidence in themselves for a
conviction.
   But a lawyer for the Contemporary Arts Center said the state
failed to show the exhibit lacked artistic merit.
   The misdemeanor charges stemmed from the exhibit ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' which appeared in Cincinnati
for seven weeks last spring.
   Frank Prouty, an assistant city prosecutor, said in his closing
argument that five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men
and two that showed children with their genitals exposed were
enough for convictions. The charges were based on those seven
pictures in the 175-photo exhibit.
   ``The pictures speak for themselves,'' Prouty told the jury in
Hamilton County Municipal Court. ``The pictures are the issue.''
   Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, said the state failed to
prove its case against the center and Barrie. No presentation was
made to back up the assertion that the photographs weren't
legitimate art.
   ``Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic
value? Don't you think that if there were people out there who
thought that, the state of Ohio would have found them?'' Mezibov
said.
   Barrie's attorney, H. Louis Sirkin, reminded jurors that the
same exhibit was shown hn Philadelphia, Chicago and Berkeley,
Calif., without incident.
   ``Is Cincinnati that different? Are we that childish? Are we not
big enough to say we can't accept what other cities have seen?''
Sirkin asked.
   Judge David Albanese instructed the jury shortly after noon.
   On Thursday, defense lawyers challenged the credentials of the
prosecution's only expert witness, Judith Reisman, on grounds that
she was unqualified, but Albanese ruled she could testify.
   Ms. Reisman said her qualifications included having prepared
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian
Institution.
   She also worked as a consultant for television's ``Captain
Kangaroo'' show, for former Attorney General Edwin Meese's
commission on pornography and for the conservative American Family
Association.
   At issue in the trial were seven photographs a grand jury cited
from the 175-photo exhibit.
   Ms. Reisman testified that photographing nude children can be a
prelude to sexual abuse.
   ``We are putting at risk additional children because many people
see themselves as photographers, and many people do use the
technique of telling children `this is appropriate because this is
in a museum,' `this is appropriate because it is in a book,''' she
said.
   ``That happens to be a standard technique for getting children
into a child sex-abuse situation.''
   Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe, who died last
year of AIDS at age 42, was an accomplished and respected
photographer, and that photographs of the children were morally and
sexually innocent.
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
run, an attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It
closes this week in Boston, where 103,000 tickets have been sold.

   Israel reacted angrily on Friday to disclosures
by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak of secret Iraqi contacts with
the Jewish state.
   However, one official acknowledged informal contacts with Iraq
during the 1980-1988 Persian Gulf war, and a source said exchanges
continued through intermediaries during the current crisis.
   Mubarak's statements followed several press reports saying
Iraqi-Israeli contacts occurred in recent weeks. But his highly
public statments were the first to draw Israel's ire.
   Eliyahu Ben-Elissar, chariman of the Israeli Parliament's
defense and foreign affairs committee, on Friday accused Mubarak of
``psychological warfare'' and said his comment was aimed at
undercutting Iraq, not Israel.
   ``He (Mubarak) wants to shame Iraq in the Arab world,''
Ben-Elissar told Israel's army radio.
   He added: ``Why in the world is he involving us at a time when
we are trying so hard - by the by, at the request of the Egyptians,
the Americans and others - not to get involved?''
   Despite repeated Iraqi threats to attack Israel in the current
crisis, Israel has maintained a low profile to avoid undermining
U.S. efforts to mobilize moderate Arab countries to counter Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Mubarak made a speech Thursday marking the 17th anniversary of
Egypt's last war with Israel. In it, he said Iraq and Israel have
had indirect contacts for years and cited secret exchanges in 1987
and 1989 through a Harvard University professor.
   Mubarak said he was disclosing the exchanges in reply to Iraqi
allegations that Egypt was subserviant to the Israeli and U.S.
intelligence services.
   He also implied that Egypt had access to Israel's intelligence
data under their 1979 peace treaty. Israel radio quoted unnamed
army officials as expressing ``shock'' at this statement and
denying there is any exchange of intelligence with Egypt.
   The Foreign and Defense ministries declined to comment on
Mubarak's statements. Avi Pazner, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said in response to a smiliar report earlier this week he
was unaware of any Israeli-Iraqi contacts during the gulf crisis.
   The first report on such contacts was late last monthin the
London-based Economist's Foreign Report. It said Iraq in recent
weeks has been sending messages to Israel via Jordan's King
Hussein.
   ``Iraq offered not to attack Israel if Israel would agree not to
attack Iraq in the event of a war in the gulf,'' the Foreign Report
said. ``Israel replied, again through King Hussein, that it had no
plan to attack Iraq or to be involved in the gulf crisis.''
   State-run Jordan radio carried a different version, saying
Saddam had sent a message to Israel via Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda.
   The Foreign Report said the contacts included meetings between
Israeli officials and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and his
deputy, Nizar Hamdoon. It said at least two proposed meetings with
an Israeli Cabinet minister fell through.
   A former Israeli government adviser on Arab affairs acknowledged
that during the gulf war ``in a great variety of ways, Israel and
Iraq were delivering messages to each other.''
   The adviser, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said the contacts were through intermediaries and were
continuing.
   ``Since Saddam's threat to burn half of Israel, such messages
have been going back and forth a number of times to prevent any
misunderstanding,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brown Wants California To Move Up Primary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown
said Friday he's disappointed the Calimaries and it hasn't had much influence
on the
nomination recently.
   Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses are held in
early February.
   ``I think it's ridiculous for the most populous state in the
country to play virtually no role in the nomination of candidates
of either party,'' Brown told a news conference.
   He said the California Legislature still has time to act. Any
move to settle the party's nomination earlier would serve the
party's interest, he said.
   Brown said that as party chairman, ``I have a responsibility to
push the party toward unifying behind a nominee as early in the
process as possible so we can start running against George Bush
rather than against each other.''
   ``The more states that move earlier in the process the better I
like it,'' he told a news conference.
   Despite that, Brown said, there's no move to replace Iowa as the
initial test.
   ``I wish other states would move up because that gives us a
chance of getting a consensus candidate who can run against and
beat George Bush,'' he said. ``None of that threatens Iowa's
first-in-the-nation caucus status.''
   Every four years the state gets heavy attention as candidates
stump throughout Iowa. The political parties like the caucuses
because the presidential candidates running in the state give them
major organizational and financial help.
   But there's a quadrennial effort to shuffle the primary lineup,
because officials in many other states argue that the caucuses give
far too much influence to a tiny and unrepresentative state.
   In addition, the complex party rules and long string of
primaries virtually assures that Democrats won't have a nominee
until very late in the process, while Republicans settle their
primaries earlier.

   More than 1,000 people angered by police
corruption took to the streets Friday night, burning barricades and
pelting riot troopers with firebombs and rocks in a crime-ridden
neighborhood.
   At least 106 people, including 83 police, have been injured in
the violence that began Tuesday in the Nishinari district of Osaka,
Japan's No. 2 city. More than 40 people have been arrested.
   The scope of the violence is extremely unusual for Japan, where
public issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree.
   The rundown neighborhood is known for its gangs, transient
laborers and shabby hotels. Locals say there long have been bad
feelings between the area's poor residents and police.
   ``Dogs of gangsters, come out, kneel down before us and
apologize!'' a man screamed through a loudspeaker to police.
``Don't you know how much hardship our daily laborers are going
through? Why don't you try working at a construction site one day
and you will probably realize how much we are abused by this
society.''
   By 1 a.m. Saturday, a crowd estimated earlier at more than 1,000
laborers from the district and outside youths had dwindled to about
600, police said. But many laborers had dispersed and those
remaining were largely high school-age youths, some of whom
appeared to be enjoying themselves.
   One was an 11-year-old boy who said he was ``just here to be on
television.''
   A man who refused to identify himself said he had come from
Kyoto, 30 miles away, because ``I thought this may be a once in a
lifetime chance for me throw stones at police and get away with
it.''
   Most of the crowd had filtered away by 3 a.m. Saturday, leaving
behind a street littered with broken glass, rocks and burned
debris. A cordon of about 20 armed troopers continued to guard the
police station.
   Earlier, about 2,500 police carrying large metal shields were in
position along main roads in Nishinari and in front of the district
police station Friday night. Four vehicles equipped with water
cannons guarded the station's main entrance.
   Police used the water cannons repeatedly to douse the more than
1,000 people confronting them. The crowd, which included day
laborers from the district and young people from outside it,
scattered each time but then regrouped.
   Large piles of burned vehicles and bicycles formed barricades
and blocked traffic. Protesters threw firebombs and rocks.
   ``We are now starting to arrest the main figures, especially the
ones who are agitating the crowd,'' police Sgt. Rentaro Ataka said
around midnight.
   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
10,000 more riot police were on alert to prevent another night of
rioting. About 100 undercover police also were mobilized, they
said.
   Rioting did not spread beyond the neighborhood, but it caused
traffic tie-ups in parts of Osaka as police blocked off several
major streets, and some rail service was disrupted.
   The violence was touched off Tuesday by the arrest of a local
policeman on suspicion of having taken $81,000 in bribes from two
gangsters.
   After hearing the news, menial laborers with longstanding
grudges against police began massing around the police station.
Authorities and residents said young hooligans and leftists from
outside the district later joined the disturbance.
   Rentarou Ataka, a police spokesman in Nishinari, said youths
from outside the area had seen the initial rioting on television
and decided to join in. He described other troublemakers as
``ultraleftists,'' but said the scope of their participation was
unclear.
   In recent years, there have been few such disturbances in Japan
other than occasional battles between riot police and leftist
extremists who oppose expansion of Tokyo's Narita airport.
   Police reported two stores were set ablaze early Friday and a
train station also was heavily damaged by fire. Several shops,
including a 24-hour convenience store, were looted.
   Osaka's police chief, Masahiro Tsubakihara, issued an apology
for the officer, who was arrested after reports he provided
information about police operations against gangs.

   Six members of the Nicaraguan coast
guard and navy were missing Friday after being fired on by crews of
two speedboats, the government radio station said.
   The incident occurred in Nicaraguan waters off the Cosiguina
reefs in the Gulf of Fonseca, shared by Nicaragua, Honduras and El
Salvador, Radio Nicaragua said.
   The report said the six Nicaraguans were patrolling the area
Thursday morning in a boat when they spotted two Piranha speedboats
traveling from Honduras.
   When they tried to stop the speedboats, machine guns were fired
at them, the station said.
   The crew has not been heard from since and the boat has not been
found, the report said.
   Spokesmen at the Interior Ministry and the Sandinista People's
Army in Managua said they had no immediate information on the
reported incident.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after dozens of Hispanics were rounded
up at a racetrack, lawyers say they have won a major victory over
government officials who tried to deport the people without proving
they were illegal aliens.
   The case was widely viewed as a test of alien rights. The
defendants refused to answer questions about how and when they
entered the country, citing Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service argued that this
silence, on its own, demonstrated that the defendants were illegal
aliens. Last year, an immigration judge agreed.
   But three weeks ago, the federal Board of Immigration Appeals
reversed that ruling, ending the deportation proceedings against
one of the defendants.
   The appeals board said the INS approach would shift the burden
of proof at a deportation proceeding.
   Since the decision, people have come forward to say federal
immigration officials used similar tactics in other cases, said Dan
Kanstroom, a Boston College law professor who assisted in the
appeal.
   But he said the Boston case marked the first national test of
this strategy.
   ``It's very important that it stopped here,'' he said.
   Daniel Levy, staff attorney at the National Immigration Law
Center in Los Angeles, said if the government's arguments had been
upheld, it would have significantly broadened INS powers.
   ``They would have been able to stop anybody on the street, send
them to court, and if the person remains quiet, the person could be
deported,'' Levy said in a telephone interview.
   Verne Jervis, spokesman for the INS, said Friday that agency
officials were still reviewing the board's decision and had not
decided what action to take.
   During the dawn raid Oct. 21, 1988, at Suffolk Downs,
authorities seized 83 Salvadoran, Mexican, Brazilian and Cuban
stable hands.
   Of those people, six were found to be in the United States
lawfully. Some of the remainder returned to their homelands, while
others admitted their illegal status and applied for asylum.
   By the time the appeals board issued its decision, 30 defendants
remained.
   On Friday, lawyers who teamed up to fight the INS gathered to
plot their next moves. The appeals board decision specifically
discussed the case of only one defendant, but Kanstroom said it
would apply to the others.
   The clients can choose to have their deportation proceedings
terminated, or may eventually decide to return home or can take
other steps such as seeking political asylum, he said.
   Judith Gail Dein, one of the lawyers who filed the appeal, said
no matter what the clients decide, the appeals board has sent a
strong message against the violation of people's basic rights.
   ``It feels real good that somebody put a stop to that,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   More than 70,000 service workers
struck for 24 hours Friday to protest government austerity measures
that have increased the cost of living.
   Employees stayed off the job at six of the main hospitals,
schools, city governments, the health ministry, National Bank and
some other institutions.
   ``So far, the strike is a big success,'' said Jose Joaquin
Melendez, coordinator of the Permanent Workers' Council. The
council, with about 110,000 government and private sector workers,
called the strike.
   Only emergencies were being attended at the largest hospital.
   ``We do not agree with the constant increases in (prices of)
goods. While the government asks workers for austerity, the
legislators and presidents of institutions are given extremely high
raises,'' Melendez said.
   Health ministry, university and some other workers also were
demanding raises of up to 15 percent to compensate for the loss of
buying power.
   Presidents of government institutions earn $2,500 a month.
Legislators recently got $900 a month raises to the same level. A
government employee earns an average $200 a month and a farm worker
$75.
   Since President Rafael Angel Calderon took office May 8, prices
of rice, beans, eggs, milk and other staples have risen 30 percent.
Four increases have doubled fuel prices, and water and electricity
rates also have gone up.
   The government says the measures were needed to reduce the high
fiscal deficit, estimated this year at $370 million, or 6 percent
of the gross domestic product.
   The country's currency, the colon, has been devalued 20 times
the past four months. Inflation for the first nine months of the
year was 17.7 percent.

<HEAD>U.S. Banking Slump Could Lessen Nation's Global Influence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decline of American banks compared with
their foreign competitors threatens to harm an already weak U.S.
economy and diminish the nation's world influence, a congressional
report concludes.
   A House Banking Committee task force, chaired by Rep. John J.
LaFalce, D-N.Y., strongly suggested that the Depression-era
constraints barring banks from expanding into new services such as
securities underwriting and insurance must fall if U.S. banks are
to regain their edge.
   ``There appears to be little doubt that repeal of the securities
restrictions imposed on U.S. banks would enhance the
competitiveness of U.S. banks globally,'' it said.
   The panel also criticized remaining barriers preventing banks
from expanding across state lines and compares the convoluted U.S.
regulatory system with its more streamlined counterparts overseas.
   The 488-page report, which was conceived as a fact-finding study
rather than a vehicle for legislative recommendations, has not been
issued yet. A draft circulated to the 20 task force members was
obtained by The Associated Press. It stresses the importance of a
competitive banking system to the economy.
   ``We must have a successful, productive economy if we are to
address societal needs and solve societal problems, and a
successful financial services delivery system is at the crux of a
successful and productive economic machine,'' the task force said.
   The panel was formed last November and held a series of hearings
through August with appearances from all of the major U.S.
financial regulators as well as private U.S. and foreign business
executives.
   Its research is intended by LaFalce, a strong advocate of
expanding bank powers, to serve as the basis for debate next year,
when the Bush administration intends to submit its plan for the
most significant overhaul of the U.S. financial system in 50 years.
   Dramatic changes in financial services technology have
increasingly shifted business away from banks toward other firms,
particularly brokerage houses, the report said.
   ``It is clear that the relative competitive position of U.S.
banks has deteriorated significantly as the U.S. banking system has
remained static in a changing world,'' it said.
   Yet, ``the U.S. continues to develop policy for its financial
services industry in a myopic and, indeed, isolationist way,'' it
said.
   As Europe prepares for economic union in 1992, its banks are
increasingly adopting the universal banking model, combining
traditional commercial banking with securities underwriting and
insurance, the task force said.
   The Japanese financial structure is more split, on paper, but
unofficial cooperative relationships among firms, known as the
``keiretsu'' system, allow Japanese banks to provide a wider array
of services than U.S. banks, it said.
   Thus it will become more difficult for U.S. banks, functioning
under a decades-old system, to compete at home and abroad, it said.
   ``Increasingly, U.S. banks will be competing at home and abroad
against foreign financial institutions that can offer customers a
full array of financial services products U.S. banks are not
capable of providing,'' it said.
   Foreign banks, particularly Japanese banks, are making
increasing inroads in the United States, the report noted. In
California, for instance, Japanese banks control about one-quarter
of all banking assets.
   Because of laws restricting the geographic expansion of U.S.
banks, often it is easier for a foreign bank to acquire a U.S.
institution, it said.
   Increasing foreign ownership of U.S. banks raises important
questions about Americans' ability to manage their own economy, it
said. If foreign control of U.S. financial institutions had been
greater after the 1987 stock market crash ``the situation could
have proved more difficult (for the Federal Reserve) to control,''
the report said.
   ``When credit is scarce, U.S. companies could find themselves at
the tail end of a very long queue, behind borrowers from Britain,
Japan, West Germany, and other countries,'' it said.
   Also, a diminished U.S. banking industry ``leaves U.S.
policymakers in the awkward position of being unable to help
procure finance for the economic policies they encourage foreign
governments to take.''

<HEAD>Soviet Military Chief Cautions Against Use of Force Against Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military chief of the Soviet Union said
Friday that ``the most important thing'' in the Persian Gulf crisis
is preventing it from escalating into a war.
   ``I very much want everybody to attune their consciousness to
the idea that you've got to find a political settlement and not be
thinking about how best to use military force,'' said Gen. Mikhail
A. Moiseyev, chief of the Soviet general staff.
   President Bush has not ruled out using the more than
170,000-strong U.S. sea, air and land force in the gulf to try to
dislodge the Iraqi army from Kuwait. The Washington Post reported
Friday that Bush has begun consulting with Congress on the possible
use of force.
   Moiseyev spoke at an unusual joint news conference at the
Pentagon with his American counterpart, Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Powell accompanied Moiseyev on a cross-country tour of U.S.
military and civilian sites, including a visit Friday to North
Island Naval Air Station near San Diego, and to the Cheyenne
Mountain Complex in Colorado, headquarters of the North American
Air Defense Command.
   Moiseyev said that after leaving Washington on Friday evening he
would stop in Havana for a meeting with the chief of the Cuban
general staff.
   At the news conference, Moiseyev deflected questions about the
likely Soviet response to a U.S.-led attack on Iraqi forces in
Kuwait. He stressed several times that Moscow saw enormous danger
in any military conflict in the gulf.
   ``The most important thing for all of us is to not allow a
military conflict to develop out of this situation,'' the general
said through an interpreter. ``We have not exhausted the whole of
the arsenal of political possibilities that we have at our
disposal,'' he added, referring to the nations against Iraq.
   Moiseyev also stressed in response to questions about the
presence of Soviet military specialists in Iraq that they are
gradually withdrawing and that their role is relatively
unimportant.
   ``These are not advisers,'' he said. ``These are technicians.''
   The general said the 206 Soviet military specialists in Iraq
include 42 interpreters, 15 members of a management team and 146
``technical specialists.'' He did not mention the function of the
other three.
   Moiseyev spoke warmly of his week-long visit to the United
States, his first. In addition to seeing military installations and
equipment, Moiseyev and his staff visited national memorials in
Washington, an automobile plant in Michigan, and San Francisco.
   ``We discovered America for ourselves,'' he said. ``We got
convinced that Americans are determined to keep the peace,
cooperate and further strengthen normal ties with the Soviet Union.
Much has changed in our perception of America.''
   Powell and Moiseyev signed an agreement on military exchanges
for 1991 and 1992, including a visit by Powell to the Soviet Union
next summer and a visit to the United States early next year by the
Soviet commander in chief of Far East Forces.

   Advocates for the blind, the obese and
Hispanics on Friday questioned a federal regulation that says
people with disabilities and no understanding of English cannot sit
next to exit doors on U.S. airlines.
   The Federal Aviation Administration regulation says only people
who are able and willing to open exit doors in emergencies and
understand flight crews and assist them with evacuations may be
seated next to the doors. The regulation took effect Friday.
   People barred from such seats include parents with small
children, people considered too frail to operate the door,
passengers with broken limbs and other disabilities, the obese,
children under 15 and the blind.
   Some airlines already prohibit blind travelers from sitting in
exit-door seats and several sightless people have been arrested in
recent years for refusing to move from seats.
   Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind,
said the rule is discriminatory and called it ``an example of the
fear that people have of being blind.''
   ``A blind person is accustomed to dealing with working without
lights,'' he said. ``They don't have a single piece of evidence
that shows that blind people are hazardous, yet they make this
judgement.''
   Others said they were concerned with how the FAA would determine
obesity or the ability to read and understand English.
   ``I understand the FAA's concern, but I feel they're making,
certainly, an arbitrary judgment about the mobility of fat
people,'' said Sally E. Smith, executive director of the National
Association to Advance Fat Acceptance.
   ``We're very concerned about the potential disparate effect of
the proposed regulation on Hispanics and others,'' said Charles
Kamasaki, vice president for research advocacy and legislation for
the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic organization.
   ``Are they going to give IQ tests? What constitutes limited
English proficiency. Even if the regulation were justified, we're
concerned about its application in practice,'' he said.
   Paul Steucke, a spokesman for the FAA, said airlines were
directed to come up with their own guidelines to determine who is
qualified to sit next to the exits.
   ``There's discretion involved,'' he said. ``You might have
somebody who's 250 pounds. If they're 6-foot-4 there probably won't
be a problem. If they're 4-foot-1, there might be.''
   William E. Oriol, a spokesman for The National Council on the
Aging, aid the organization was still examining the regulation.
   Reaction from passengers who traveled through three U.S.
airports on Friday was mixed.
   Some said they were concerned about the English-only provision.
   ``They already have everything written in English and Spanish
anyway - maybe they should have bilingual people sitting there,''
said Jennette Heck, who flew in to Miami from New Orleans. ``But I
don't think handicapped people should sit right by the door - they
could get hurt in the panic.''
   Martin Cohen, 48, of Easton, Pa., favored the rule.
   ``I have a young child, and when I'm traveling with her, they
don't want us to sit next to the emergency door,'' said Cohen, who
was at Boston's Logan International Airport. ``The idea is to get
the exit open in a plane crash. You should have someone who could
open the exit.''
   Jeff Bank, 27, of New York, who also was in Boston, said: ``You
have to do what's necessary to protect all the passengers, and it
just makes sense.''

<TEXT>
   A traveling exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's
photographs closed Friday, leaving in its wake protests and a
conservative attack on the National Endowment for the Arts.
   At an earlier stop in Cincinnati, the exhibit prompted an
obscenity prosecution of an art gallery and its director, a case
that ended Friday in acquittal. The jury in the nation's first such
prosecution of an art gallery rejected prosecutor's argument that
seven of the pictures were obscene.
   Cincinnati's Contemporary Art Gallery and its director, Dennis
Barrie, were acquitted of charges of pandering obscenity and using
children in nudity-related material.
   Some say the furor surrounding the trial and the traveling
exhibit has helped the art world by drawing record crowds to
galleries and forcing artists to become politically active to
support their work.
   ``It has brought a lot of artists out of their studios to
organize and demonstrate their own moral and political strength for
the first time since the end of the Vietnam War,'' said David Ross,
director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston where the
photos were exhibited.
   ``I think the silver lining has been that the art world has been
... given a sense of direction that it didn't have before.''
   The exhibit combined Mapplethorpe's explicit homoerotic
photographs - the source of the controversy - with cool, elegant
portraits and photographs of flowers. Mapplethorpe helped organize
the show shortly before he died of AIDS in March 1989 at age 42.
   Boston was the last stop on the exhibit's seven-city tour. About
103,000 people saw the show during its nine weeks at the institute,
about twice the number that visited the museum all last year, said
Arthur Cohen, director of marketing. Membership in the museum also
has surged recently, he added.
   But Cohen said the increased income from the show was offset by
higher security and insurance costs. The net income came to less
than half the amount lost in grants recently.
   ``We're not even coming out even,'' he said.
   In Washington, D.C., 48,000 people saw the show during its
three-week stay at the Washington Project for the Arts. A popular
10-week exhibit there usually draws 8,000, said Philip Brookman,
who curated that show after it was canceled at the Corcoran Gallery
of Art 17 months ago.
   ``Our membership has increased quite a bit. Our attendance has
been consistently high since the Mapplethorpe show,'' Brookman
said. ``It was received very positively by critics and the public
at large. Mothers came in with their children.''
   Others saw the show's aftermath differently.
   ``We're worse off for Mapplethorpe. In the long run, we're much
worse off,'' said Rita Burke, president of Morality in Media of
Massachusetts.
   Burke said the lesson for her in the Mapplethorpe show was that
the normal person is helpless to fight the media.
   ``I think it has raised consciousness to how difficult it is for
the average person who is really turned off by material like
this,'' she said. ``I find that an awful lot of people are giving
up. They wring their hands.''
   The exhibit attracted little attention in its first showings in
Philadelphia and Chicago, but in Washington it caught the eye of
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Helms and other congressional conservatives were angered by
several photographs with homosexual and sadomasochistic subjects.
Their attack forced the Corcoran to cancel the show in mid-1989.
Since then, the focus has shifted to two photographs of two
children with exposed genitals.
   Morality in Media was unsuccessful in attempts to bring criminal
charges against the Boston institute.
   The controversy has also forced the national endowment's new
director, John Frohnmayer, to institute a requirement that artists
sign a statement agreeing to not use NEA funds to make obscene art.
Some have turned down grants in protest.
   Frohnmayer also rejected four grants, approved by peer review
panels, that would have gone to controversial artists. The ``NEA
Four'' - as they are known in arts circles - filed suit in federal
court on Sept. 27, asking for the $23,000 in grants or a review of
their applications. The four had all received NEA grants in the
past.

   Winter took aim at the Rockies Friday, while usually dry
southwest Texas braced for another round of heavy rain and
flooding.
   A winter storm warning with snow advisories was posted for the
mountains and passes near the Continental Divide in northern
Montana and Wyoming.
   Advisories for snow Friday afternoon and night were posted for
the mountains and foothills of southwest and central Montana, as
well as for the higher elevations of south-central Montana Friday
night.
   Gusty wind marked the eastern edge of the storm. Unseasonably
warm afternoon temperatures were expected to drop by as much as 35
and 40 degrees Friday night.
   A snow advisory for Friday night also was posted for the higher
elevations of the northern mountains of Wyoming.
   There were heavy thunderstorms during the afternoon over
southwest Texas. The storms moved northeast during the morning and
reached Brownsville near noon. The storms brought strong, gusty
winds along with locally heavy rain and and the possibility of
flooding.
   By midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from northern
Maine, through New Hampshire and Vermont into southwest New York
state. Small hail fell at Caribou, Maine, near noon.
   Showers stretched from west-central Montana, through the Idaho
panhandle into central Idaho.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms were also over eastern
Florida, south-central Louisiana, southern Texas and southwest
Texas.
   Heavier rain included 1.62 inches at Melbourne, Fla.
   Friday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 21 at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38 at
Cutbank, Mont., to 93 at Tampa, Fla.
   Hurricane warnings remained for the northern Leeward Islands,
tropical storm warnings were posted for Guadeloupe and nearby
islands. A hurricane watch was posted for the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands. Hurricane Klaus was northeast of Antigua, drifting
toward the northwest.

   A $250,000 reward will be paid to a California
woman whose testimony helped convict her mother in two killings
with cyanide-laced Excedrin, a spokesman for a pharmaceutical group
said Friday.
   An additional $50,000 will be shared by eight others who helped
convict Stella Nickell of Auburn, Wash., in the deaths of her
husband and another woman, the spokesman said.
   The Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association had offered
the rewards for information leading to an arrest in the June 1986
killings, which led to the nation's first trial in a
product-tampering death.
   Cynthia Hamilton, 30, the Nickells' daughter who now lives in
Garden Grove, Calif., testified that Mrs. Nickell repeatedly talked
about ways to kill her husband, Bruce Nickell, who was 52 when he
died.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Nickell put cyanide in capsules of
Extra-Strength Excedrin and gave them to her husband. She also
planted other bottles of cyanide-tainted Excedrin in stores in
local stores to divert suspicion, authorities said.
   Mrs. Nickell had three life insurance policies on her husband.
The other victim was Susan Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn, who
authorities said had bought the poisoned capsules.
   The deaths sparked a nationwide tampering scare and prompted
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers Co. to recall its
over-the-counter capsule medications.
   Mrs. Nickell was convicted two years later.
   The reward is the second paid by the pharmaceutical group.
Another $300,000 was shared by nine people who helped police arrest
a Florida man in 1986. Authorities said he put rat poison in
capsules of several SmithKline Beckman Corp. products in Florida
and Texas in a failed scheme to manipulate the price of SmithKline
stock.
   ``We offered the rewards as a deterrent because we feel that the
best way to deter tampering is to catch the tamperers,'' said John
T. Walden, a senior vice president of the Nonprescription Drug
Manufacturers Association.
   Rewards authorized for two other drug-tampering cases remain
unpaid.
   The association authorized a $200,000 reward for information
leading to an arrest and conviction in the 1986 death of Diane
Elsroth of Yonkers, N.Y., who took cyanide-laced Tylenol, he said.
   The same amount is offered in the 1982 Chicago-area deaths of
seven people, who also were killed with tainted Tylenol capsules,
he said.
   The eight who will also share in the reward in the Nickell case
are: Thomas Noonan of Auburn, Wash., $15,000; Bonnie Anderson of
Federal Way, Wash., $10,000; Denise Button of Seattle, $7,500;
Sandra Scott of Auburn, $7,500; Katy Parker of Auburn, $2,500;
Gerald McIntyre of Kent, Wash.; Lynn Force, of Seattle, $2,500; and
Melinda Denton of Seattle, $2,500.

<HEAD>Panel Votes To Ban Charcoal Lighter Fluids By 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air quality officials Friday ordered
makers of charcoal lighter lluid to cook up a cleaner-burning
product by 1992 or face a ban on barbecuers' favorite fuel.
   The Air Quality Management District, trying to clean up the
skies over the Los Angeles area, took on a summer way of life for 2
million Californians by voting 10-1 to impose strict standards on
lighter fluid and self-starting charcoal briquettes.
   Experts say lighter fluids contribute more harmful emissions
than many people would think - an estimated 2 tons per day of
smog-forming hydrocarbon emissions. That's a little more than the
average oil refinery belches into the air each day.
   On a hot summer day, fluids can emit up to 4 tons of emissions.
   Board member Mike Antonovich, the only one to oppose the plan,
called it a waste of time and said it placed an unfair burden on
store owners. He said backyard chefs could get around the plan by
buying lighter fluid at stores outside of the air quality district,
which covers four counties around Los Angeles.
   The rule doesn't set any penalties for using the lighter fluid,
just for selling it, he said.
   ``Instead of aiming our big guns at the automobiles ... we're
nuking the barbecue,'' Antonovich said.
   The barbecue industry opposed the plan and asked for more time
to reformulate its products. Lighter fluid sales amount to more
than $5 million in Southern California every year.
   ``Industry is willing, able and ready to reformulate,'' said Pat
Meehan of the Barbecue Industry Association. ``We're concerned
about air quality, too.''
   Most members of the Naperville, Ill.-based association make
charcoal briquettes and fluid rather than electric or other
lighters.
   But board members said the industry has had plenty of time to
improve its lighter fluid and that it still has a chance to
reformulate its products.
   ``I've been trying to clean the air for 20 years. Where've you
been?'' asked board member Marvin Braude, representing Los Angeles
County. ``You could have done it last year, the year before, or
five years ago.''
   Braude drew hisses from the audience when he cut off Meehan in
mid-sentence and said he didn't want to hear from the industry
representative any more.
   While the board considered the plan inside, the AQMD staff
cooked hot dogs and stuffed bell peppers outside. The charcoal was
lighted by wood chips, newspapers and electric prods - methods
officials say are cleaner than lighter fluids.
   Inside the hearing room industry representatives illustrated
their presentation with slides showing cans of lighter fluid,
different sizes of barbecues and clumps of charcoal briquettes.
   Speakers included a condominium owner who said his complex had
banned lighter fluids because elderly residents were getting ill
and a campground operator who urged the board to continue selling
lighter fluids because other methods, he said, were dangerous.
   The strict lighter fluid rules are the latest in a series of
tough measures the AQMD has taken to clean Southern California
skies.
   So far this year the district's four-county area has recorded 35
first-stage smog alerts - the least serious of three levels of
alert, when children, the elderly and those with respiratory
diseases are warned to avoid strenuous activity. The district
covers Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange and western San Bernardino
counties.
   The lighter fluid rule requires manufacturers to drastically
reduce lighter fluid emissions and bans the sale of fluids
exceeding the new limits as of Jan. 1, 1992. Merchants who violate
the rule face fines as high as $25,000 per day.
   The new limits would reduce the allowed emissions of volatile
hydrocarbons from .09 pounds per ``barbecue event'' to .02 pounds.
   According to the barbecue industry, emissions from fluid and
self-starting charcoal represent .2 percent of the total emissions
in the Los Angeles Basin, less than the AQMD contends. Cars, by
comparison, emit 31.5 percent of the total.
   Barbecue industry spokeswoman Sandy Burton said the industry and
the AQMD would continue to work together on testing methods and
that the industry may well be able to bring its products into
compliance.
   ``It's not a matter of being happy or not happy right now,'' she
said. ``We're going to continue to work on this.''

<HEAD>Peruvian Government Extends State of Emergency in Lima and Callao</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government extended Friday for 60 days the
state of emergency in the Lima metropolitan area and neighboring
port of Callao, granting the army sweeping powers to combat leftist
guerrillas.
   The state of emergency places Lima, its largest city, and
Callao, its biggest port, under military control. Authorities can
restrict freedom of movement, ban public meetings, detain people
without charge and conduct searches without a warrant.
   Lima, home to one-third of Peru's 22 million residents, was
previously controlled by the police. But one of President Alberto
Fujimori's first acts on being sworn in on July 28 was to hand Lima
and Callao over to army control.
   Over half of Peru's population lives under military control.
Eight departments and one province, in Peru's southern and central
highlands, as well as the northern jungle, have been declared
emergency zones.
   Political violence has claimed more than 20,000 lives in the 10
years since the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas took up arms.
   The government first decreed the state of emergency in December
1982 in the Andean department of Ayacucho, birthplace of the
insurgent group.

   A critic of Mayor Bill Boner, known for
his romantic affairs as well as his politics, said she would turn
down a chance to confront the mayor on national television because
she's afraid he will embarrass Nashville.
   Newlywed Boner and his fourth wife, aspiring country singer
Traci Peel, are to appear on Phil Donahue's nationally syndicated
talk show this month.
   Jo Ann North, a city councilwoman and critic of Boner, was
invited to appear on the same show, but says she'll decline.
   North fears Boner will only embarrass his hometown, which has
been trying to polish its image to attract a National League
baseball franchise.
   ``If I thought I would have an opportunity to talk about all the
wonderful things in Nashville and promote Nashville, I'd do it in a
heartbeat,'' North said. ``The only good thing that can come out of
this is the promotion of Traci Peel's career.''
   Bonerand Peel married Monday in Hawaii. They began dating while
he lived with his third wife. Their affair gained wide attention
after a reporter called the couple one evening and Peel commented
that the mayor's passion could last seven hours.
   Bumper stickers soon appeared, proclaiming: ``Seven hours for
Traci, three years for Nashville.''
   A Nashville car dealer offered to pay Boner's $75,000 salary if
the mayor would resign before his term ends next year. Boner on
Friday requested the Davidson County Grand Jury investigate the
offer as a possible violation of state law. Boner reiterated that
the mayor's office is not for sale and that he didn't intend to
resign.

   While the brunt of a government shutdown
Saturday would not hit for three days, visitors to the Statue of
Liberty, the Washington Monument and Yellowstone National Park
would feel the effects at once.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman told agency heads
they should be ready to send home all non-essential employees
scheduled to work Saturday. His memo cited the failure by Congress
to pass legislation to fund the government byond a midnight Friday
deadline.
   The bulk of the federal work force of 2.4 million was told to
report to work Tuesday - even if only to be sent home after a few
hours. Monday is a federal holiday.
   Barring a last-minute compromise, this would be the fourth time
over the past decade that the federal government has sent its
employees home because its authority to spend money expired. The
last time, in 1986, the impasse lasted half a day.
   Then, the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument and St.
Louis' Gateway Arch all were closed because Park Service workers
were sent home.
   This time, tourists to the nation's captial would find the
Smithsonian Institution's 12 museums closed too. White House
gardeners hung up their rakes and left.
   The Park Service prepared to shut down these monuments Saturday
and to ``padlock everything that can be padlocked,'' said Bob
Walker, a spokesman for the Interior Department.
   ``If a visitor wants to drive into Yellowstone or Shenandoah
Park, there'll be no one there to keep them out - or charge them a
toll to get in. But those people would be largely on their own,''
Walker said. ``If their car broke down, there would be no friendly
ranger to help them.''
   The Postal Service would not be affected by the shutdown because
it is not dependent on government appropriations.
   Amtrak rail passenger service would not be immediately affected
for the same reason. It does, however, receive a large government
subsidy so that its operations would be hard hit if the budget
impasse is long lasting.
   President Bush convened an emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss
details of a government shutdown.
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said there would be significant
disruptions of government services beginning on Saturday and each
day they would grow ``a little worse.''
   Each agency decides what is an essential service. But,
generally, employees whose jobs are needed for protecting public
health or safety - such as air traffic controllers, prison guards
and the military - would be allowed to keep working.
   ``Beginning Saturday morning, the head of each agency must be
prepared to implement his or her existing plan for closing down
operations,'' Darman said in a memo to the agency heads.
   Only those services needed to ``protect life and property'' will
be permitted to continue in the absence of a budget agreement,
Darman said.
   A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Bob
Buckhorn, said that ``if we have a shutdown, essential services
remain in place,'' including air traffic controllers. Other FAA
employes who deal with safety would also continue working, he said.
   Every office in the Commerce Department except the National
Weather Service would be affected by a shutdown, a Commerce
spokesman said.
   The shutdown would hit NASA at an awkward time. Shortly before
midnight, fueling is to begin for an early morning launch of the
space shuttle Discovery.
   No one is suggesting a layoff for the five astronauts who,
during the four-day mission, are scheduled to deploy the Ulysses
probe on its five-year journey to the sun.
   However, the government technically will lack the authority to
pay employees for their work because none of the 13 appropriations
bills needed to fund the government for the fiscal year that began
Monday has been enacted.
   After the government was forced to shut down briefly in 1981,
1984 and 1986, Congress voted to reimburse all federal employees
for lost pay.
   This time, the situation was complicated by the fact that the
government's power to borrow money was also expiring at midnight
Friday - unless Congress passed and Bush signed an extension of the
federal debt limit.
   At the Agriculture Department, workers who normally work on
weekends - primarily Forest Service workers - were told they would
likely be sent home Saturday.
   Kelly Ship, a department spokeswoman, said only that a handful
of the department's 100,000 employees nationwide would be
considered essential and expected to report to work during a
shutdown, she added.
   State and county offices of major USDA agencies, such as the
Farmers Home Administration and the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, would close.
   Federal meat and poultry inspection, however, would continue
during a general shutdown, she said.
   A Pentagon spokesman said senior department officials were in
closed meetings Friday afternoon discussing what actions would be
required on Saturday if the government were shut down.
   The spokesman, Jim Turner, said the department would not comment
on its contingency plans.
   The Pentagon has more than 3 million employees, including 2.1
million uniformed personnel. It appeared unlikely that any forced
shutdown of Defense Department operations would affect the
deployment of more than 170,000 servicemen and women in the Persian
Gulf.
   At the State Department, officials said that all personnel are
expected to show up Tuesday but that non-essential employees would
be sent home. No estimate was available on the number of employees
in that category.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, said the impact on
overseas posts is likely to be minimal for the time being.
   They added that the budget situation would not affect the State
Department task force monitoring the Persian Gulf crisis.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister in Jordan Calls for Attacking American Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundamentalist Cabinet minister and
senior clergymen on Friday urged Moslems to retaliate against the
U.S. military intervention in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We cannot retaliate against the United Saates itself because
vast oceans separate us. But we now have the opportunity to
retaliate against the American troops and other crusaders who are a
stone's throw from us,'' Ali al-Fakir, minister of religious
affairs, told 10,000 worshippers attending a prayer sermon.
   Al-Fakir, a sheik who was elected to Parliament last year,
previously has stressed that political statements he makes at
Friday prayer gatherings or reflect only his personal opinion and
not that of the government.
   ``I assure you that you will take them captives and shackle them
with chains as Moslems did with crusaders'' in the 12th century, he
told the crowd at Hamzah Mosque in the suburb of Marka, five miles
east of Amman.
   Fakir also blasted Egypt and Syria for committing troops to the
U.S.-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   Many Moslems view the presence of non-Moslem forces in the
kingdom that harbors Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina as
an insult to their faith.
   ``That decision by Cairo and Damascus was inspired by material
motives. Which is dearer to the nation, Kuwait or Palestine?'' he
said criticizing the Arabs' failure to fight Israel to regain
territories lost in the 1967 war, including Jerusalem.
   ``Which is more sacred, the oil wells or Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa
Mosque?'' he said, referring to Islam's third holiest shrine.
   The Jordanian government has officially condemned the invasion
of Kuwait and called for an Iraqi withdrawal. However, as a close
ally of Iraq it has denounced the foreign military intervention in
the region, urging an Arab solution to the problem.

<HEAD>David Duke Attacks GOP Tactic in Senate Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke
predicted Friday that the withdrawal of the Republican Party's U.S.
Senate candidate would help Duke defeat incumbent Democrat J.
Bennett Johnston.
   Both Johnston and Duke predicted an outright win in Saturday's
open primary.
   State Sen. Ben Bagert, the party-sanctioned Republican, withdrew
Thursday. He said his polls indicated he could draw just enough
votes from Johnston to force the Democrat into a Nov. 6 runoff
against Duke, who is campaigning as a Republican.
   Duke threatened at a news conference to sue the state over
absentee ballots cast for Bagert. Duke wants those voters to have
another chance to vote over several days next week. About 62,000
absentee ballots - a state record - were cast, officials said.
   ``The people of Louisiana are sick and tired of back room
deals,'' Duke said. ``Most of the Bagert votes are conservative and
would go against a liberal incumbent. ... We have thousands of
Louisianans who are being disenfranchised from this very important
vote.''
   Secretary of State Fox McKeithen has said that votes for Bagert
will not count and will not figure into the official percentages
that determine whether a runoff is needed.
   Johnston, a Democrat seeking his fourth term, predicted an
overwhelming turnout against Duke, a Republican state
representative.
   ``There is a message going out to the voters tomorrow,''
Johnston said at rally. ``There is no place in Louisiana. There is
no place for Nazism in this state.''
   Smiling and appearing relaxed, Johnston implored his supporters
to vote, especially in light of Thursday's withdrawal by Bagert.
   ``We're going to surprise them at the polls tomorrow,'' Johnston
said.
   Johnston, who garnered the unprecedented endorsement of eight of
his Republican Senate colleagues, has said that Duke's politics
would cost Louisiana military installations and other federal
projects.
   ``This election is about a definition of Louisiana,'' Johnston
said. ``I think when it is over ... we're going to be a better
state for it.''
   Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development, endorsed
Johnston on Friday.
   ``I was for Ben Bagert. Now that he's dropped out ... I'm
announcing my support for Bennett. There is no place in the
Republican Party for the politics of racism, bigotry and
anti-semitism and the politics of essentially negativism,'' Kemp
said.
   National GOP leaders have shunned Duke and barred him from
receiving any party funds. Despite the condemnation, Duke has been
the chief threat to Johnston from the first day of the campaign.
Pollsters have said there may be a ``hidden vote'' for Duke that
has not emerged on any survey of voters.
   State officials have said voter turnout could be over the 75
percent mark. In addition to the Senate race, Louisiana voters
decide Saturday on a proposed lottery and cast ballots for seven
congressional races.
   Democrats are hoping to break a 4-4 tie in the state's U.S.
House delegation. State Sen. Foster Campbell, a Democrat, is trying
to unseat Republican Rep. Jim McCrery in the 4th District. GOP Rep.
Clyde Holloway faces two Democratic state senators - Joe McPherson
and Cleo Fields. In the 2nd District, 12 candidates are vying to
replace retiring Rep. Lindy Boggs, a Democrat.

   Under pressure from town officials, a
theater canceled ``Henry and June,'' a movie that premiered Friday
with the new adults-only rating NC-17.
   The Motion Picture Association of America said the decision
brought back ``the dark ages of censorship.'' And Professor Alan
Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, who is representing ``Henry and
June'' director Philip Kaufman, said Kaufman was considering legal
action against the town.
   ``It's a clear violation of the constitution and a clear
violation of civil rights,'' Dershowitz said. ``The only basis on
which you can legally ban movies is if they are legally obscene,
and the ratings don't go to that.''
   The MPAA replaced the X rating with the NC-17 rating on Sept.
26. NC-17 means children under age 17 cannot be admitted.
   Showcase Cinema called off Friday's opening of ``Henry and
June'' at its Dedham theater after complaints from two selectmen.
The film is based on the diaries of Anais Nin and chronicles her
affairs with writer Henry Miller and his wife.
   Kaufman said his movie covers a range of important adult themes,
including sexuality, creativity and duplicity.
   ``There's this kind of blindness to this film that I find not
only confusing and unfair,'' Kaufman said. ``It's also, I feel, not
part of the tradition of a free country. It amounts to
censorship.''
   ``What two city officials in Dedham have done is to go backward
into the dark ages of censorship, when witches were burned at the
stake,'' said MPAA chief executive officer Jack Valenti.
   Anthony Taurasi, chairman of the town's board of selectmen, said
Showcase Cinema had a gentleman's agreement with the town not to
show X-rated films and that the NC-17 rating was ``just a way
around the ratings bureau.''
   ``They can call it whatever they want to call it,'' Taurasi
said. ``If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it's a
duck. Let's call it what it is.''
   Both Taurisi and selectman Frank Geishecker said they had not
seen the Universal Pictures release, which stars Fred Ward and Uma
Thurman.
   An MPAA spokeswoman said she had heard of no other disputes over
the NC-17 rating.
   Ira Korf, chief executive officer of Showcase Cinema's parent
company, National Amusements Inc., said Friday his company had
thought NC-17 would be added to the rating system, rather than
replace the X designation.
   ``We thought that the X would remain,'' Korf said in a
statement.
   The association changed the rating designation because the X
rating carried the stigma of pornography.
   ``Henry and June'' was given the NC-17 rating because of two
lesbian sex scenes and a shot of an erotic drawing.
   Korf said National Amusements had not seen the rating guide in
writing and wanted to examine it further before taking a permanent
stand on the NC-17 rating.
   ``We decided that we would respect the local community's wishes
until we have had time to further study the matter,'' Korf said.
   More than 25,000 people live in Dedham, about 10 miles south of
Boston.
   ``Henry &amp; June'' was scheduled to open on 77 screens in 31
cities in the United States and Canada Friday.

   Elderly residents said Friday they watched in
horror as panicked neighbors jumped from windows to escape a fire
in a four-story senior apartment house. Four people were killed and
dozens injured.
   The body of a fifth person, who apparently died in his apartment
a few days earlier of a heart attack, was found in the smoking
ruins.
   ``I got out, but some was too scared. They just jumped,'' said
Alison McCants, 61, her hands still shaking hours after the blaze
was extinguished.
   McCants, who lived on the third floor, said she planned to
remain in the partly charred building, possibly on a cot in the
basement. ``I don't have nowhere else to go.''
   The fire broke out Thursday night at the Majestic Manor in
Detroit's midtown Boston-Edison neighborhood. It was extinguished
early Friday. Fire Chief Harold Watkins said the 76-year-old
building lacked fire escapes and sprinklers.
   About 65 tenants over age 50 pay about $190 a month to live in
the building, which is an apartment building, not a care home.
Owner Harold Stehlik of Dearborn Heights didn't return calls
Friday.
   Dr. Bader Cassin, chief medical examiner at the Wayne County
morgue, said four people died of smoke and soot inhalation. The
fifth, an unidentified male, suffered a fatal heart attack in his
apartment and had been dead, unnoticed by neighbors, several days
when the fire broke out, Cassin said.
   Dozens of others were treated for smoke inhalation, police Sgt.
George Anthony said.
   Police and fire officials said they were uncertain of the cause
of the fire. Apartment manager Geraldine Larkin said she believed
the fire started from cigarette butts in a garbage can in a
stairwell, although fire officials also were checking the
possibility of a stove fire.
   Police questioned a 50-year-old resident but released him,
Anthony said.
   Larkin said she was uncertain whether the man was involved.
   ``He had burned a skillet earlier. I was so angry I said, `You
set this,' and they took him to jail,'' Larkin said. ``I might have
jumped the gun.''
   Damage occurred on all four floors of the west wing and the
third floor of the east wing, Larkin said. Some residents moved to
vacant apartments that escaped damage. Others packed up to stay
with friends.
   Diamond Stewart, 58, said he climbed out the window of his
apartment when he saw a fire department ladder appear through the
smoke.
   ``I heard somebody holler `fire.' I couldn't see nothing but
smoke,'' Stewart said. ``I came out the kitchen window through the
fourth floor. I was lucky.''
   Laverga Jones, 31, and her boyfriend, Elmer Slater, in his 60s,
died trying to escape through a window in Stewart's apartment, said
Jones' sister, Ladena Williams. She said her sister was four
months' pregnant.
   ``She was trying to get out and she tripped,'' said Williams,
who ran from her grandmother's house nearby when she heard about
the fire. ``They told me Virgie was dead. I said no way. I looked
all over for her. I can't believe this.''
   The fire also killed Matthew Carter, 50, and Roland Cooper, 42,
Cassin said.
   About a dozen residents gathered in the lobby at midmorning
Friday. Some wearing bathrobes carried canes as they looked at the
blackened brick walls, broken glass and crushed flowers in the
courtyard where their neighbors fell or jumped.

<TEXT>
   President Bush vetoed a bill Friday imposing
tight quotas on imports of textiles and shoes, saying the measure
``picks the pockets of U.S. consumers'' by drastically driving up
prices to the tune of $2,600 per family over four years.
   He called the measure ``reprehensible'' and said it would cause
an ``economic calamity'' by forcing a collapse of international
trade talks.
   Congress had ignored threats of a veto in enacting the
legislation, which imposes quotas of its own on imports of
textiles, textile products and nonrubber shoes.
   Trade in textiles is regulated by international agreements which
impose other quotas.
   ``This highly protectionist bill would damage the national
economy, increase already artificially high costs to consumers of
several basic goos and abrogate our international agreements,''
Bush said in a veto message.
   Disputing claims by the bill's supporters, Bush said the textile
industry was doing well. Domestic production has been up slightly
since 1987, he said, and unemployment in major textile-producing
states is lower than the national average.
   ``Economic indicators illustrate that the problems this bill is
intended to address do not exist,'' Bush said.
   ``The consumer costs of all restrictions on textile and apparel
imports are conservatively estimated to increase to a total of $160
billion over the next five years,'' Bush said. ``That amounts to an
onerous $2,600 for a family of four over that same period.
   ``These costs would continue to rise annually,'' he added. ``In
essence, this legislation picks the pockets of U.S. consumers in
order to subsidize the textile industry at a cost of $70,000
annually per job saved.''
   Bush said there would be swift retaliation against the United
States by nations hit by the quotas. U.S. companies would be
particularly hard hit in agriculture, aerospace, high technology,
capital goods and services, he said.
   Moreover, he said, ``this protectionist bill unquestionably
would result in a mass exodus of perhaps half the 100 nations''
participating in the international trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

<TEXT>
   The head of President Bush's church on Friday
urged that ``he remain steadfast and never give in to the trap of
war'' in the present Middle East crisis.
   Presiding Episcopal Bishop Edmond L. Browning said an atmosphere
of tensions, apparent diplomatic stalemate and ``threat of war''
had moved him to speak out on the situation.
   In a statement addressed to the church's bishops and its 2.5
million members, including Bush, Browning called for ``cooperative
and peaceful solutions.''
   ``In spite of the near unanimity of the United Nations in
confronting the crisis, the time is fraught with danger,'' he said.
``Huge armies and armadas, led by those of our own country, face
each other with the promise of unimaginable destruction and
havoc.''
   Although supporting the U.N. sanctions against Iraq's ``naked
aggression,'' and saying Iraq must withdraw completely from Iraq,
Browning questioned some Western motives.
   ``For what reason has our nation unleashed the greatest military
force since the Vietnam war?'' he said. ``Are we not justified in
suspecting that the reason is primarily economic, having to do with
unimpeded access to oil?''
   He urged examination of ``our national priorites and our
addiction to unnecessary consumption.''
   He said he prayed that Bush adhere to U.N. resolutions ``and I
pray for him as he wrestles with the difficult decisions of his
office. I urge that he remain steadfast and never give in to the
trap of war.''
   Declaring this ``is not a time for propaganda but for sober
truth,'' Browning cautioned that ``we not demonize, stereotype or
oversimplify'' in assessments of the Iraqi people.
   ``Resist the misplaced national pride which refuses to recognize
the face of Christ in your brother and sister in Iraq and the
Middle East.''
   Browning said the crisis is interconnected with the Palestinian
problem and must be seen in that light rather than as an isolated
incident.
   He said, ``I continue to believe firmly that the United Nations
and the Arab states themselves, working in concert, offer the best
hope for a bloodless solution to the conflict.''

<HEAD>Director Resigns, Mayor Says Zoo Operations Due For Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoo Director Warren Thomas announced his
retirement Friday, less than a month after federal inspectors cited
the zoo for more than 100 violations of the Animal Welfare Act.
   Mayor Tom Bradley said Thomas' departure provides an opportunity
to re-examine zoo operations, but denied the director was being
forced out of the $83,000-per-year job he held for 17 years.
   ``This was a volunteer action on his part,'' Bradley said at a
news conference.
   Thomas's last day on the job will be Jan. 4.
   ``I will leave with a variety of emotions, one of which will be,
of course, sadness,'' Thomas, 59, said in a news release.
``However, my successor will inherit one of the great animal
collections of the world, and a dedicated group of experienced zoo
professionals. And I'm proud of that, too.''
   Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited the zoo for
more than 100 violations, including storage of toxic substances
near food additives and medicine, dead mice, inadequate housing and
run-down animal barns.
   If not remedied, the violations could lead to thousands of
dollars in fines and revocation of the zoo's license. A bond
measure on this fall's election ballot would provide some $30
million for badly needed repairs.
   Federal inspectors who visited the zoo on Thursday said most of
the problems had been corrected, said Assistant Recreation and
Parks Director Sheldon Jensen.
   Thomas also came under fire for allegedly keeping a cash account
for special projects without notifying his city government
supervisors. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas funded the
account with fees paid by film crews that used the zoo.
   The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, which held the account,
said Thomas withdrew money for various zoo projects and for a
recent trip. The association said there was no indication any of
the money was misspent.

<TEXT>
   The mutiny on the Philippines'
second-largest island again tarnished the image of President
Corazon Aquino's government, which stood to lose no matter how the
revolt ended.
   Politicians demanded firm action against Col. Alexander Noble,
who launched the seventh rebellion against Mrs. Aquino's
4{-year-old government on Thursday. Noble organized a private army
after taking part in a failed coup in December.
   He surrendered early Saturday after trying to sneak out of the
military garrison he captured two days earlier.
   ``Government must now take the strongest possible measures to
ensure that this become the last challenge that (military rebels)
ever make against constitutional authority,'' said House Speaker
Ramon Mitra.
   Such statements have accompanied the previous coup attempts
against Mrs. Aquino since she took power in the February 1986
``people power revolution'' that overthrew President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Ordinarily, however, the mutineers simply surrender after
protracted negotiations. Key leaders of past revolts have
disappeared. Ordinary soldiers are then sent to different units for
retraining.
   Senior commanders appeared fearful that bloodshed would further
divide the armed forces and encourage sympathy for ``brother
soldiers'' within the ranks.
   It would also play into the hands of renegade officers who
portray the Aquino government as elitist and corrupt.
   In a statement Friday, the underground Young Officers Union
accused the military leadership of barking ``orders from their
air-conditioned rooms and cellular-equipped luxury cars'' while
disregarding the hardships of common soldiers.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate defense committee,
alluded to this when he urged the government to address problems of
pay, promotions and living conditions in the military.
   ``How many times do we have to give this warning before
President Aquino listens?'' Maceda said. ``The Aquino government
must for once to meaningfully and substantially respond to the
problems of our people.''
   The latest revolt was all the more embarrassing because the
military had been predicting for months that mutineers would stage
an uprising on Mindanao, possibly as a prelude to a coup attempt in
Manila.
   Furthermore, the military launched operations in August to
capture Noble and regaled the media daily with reports that the
colonel would soon be captured.
   Instead, he and his forces managed to travel more than 100 miles
across northern Mindanao encountering no resistance.
   ``There is little likelihood that Noble can topple the Aquino
administration, but there is a very real threat that the Aquino
officials may expire from sheer embarrassment,'' commentator Luis
Beltran wrote in The Manila Standard.
   ``Unfortunately, it looks like the only thing this
administration is capable of capturing is the common cold.''
   Most Filipinos have little sympathy for military rebels. But the
inability of the government to control the dissidents has
discredited a civilian administration that seems unable to deliver
basic services, control prices and guide national development.
   That concern has been reflected in the business community, which
is already alarmed over the prospects of economic decline brought
on by the Persian Gulf crisis and the effects of July's earthquake
that killed more than 1,600 people.
   Economists already have revised economic prospects downward
because of rising oil prices and the return of thousands of
Filipinos who were working in the Middle East.
   In a speech Friday, Herman Montenegro, chairman of the annual
conference of the Chamber of Commerce, warned of a crisis of
confidence in Mrs. Aquino.
   ``The government must dispel the fear that a military coup is a
distinct possibility at any time,'' he said.
   Also Friday, the Central Bank reported businesses transferred
$148 million abroad in the first six months of the year - an
increase of more than 400 percent over the same time last year.
   In an editorial Friday, the pro-government newspaper The Manila
Chronicle warned that instability was sapping the nation's viality.
   ``The government's mistakes and shortcomings of the past ...
have exhausted the nation,'' the newspaper said. ``Though most
people still look forward to the 1992 elections for some possible
relief, there are those who are becoming seduced by the idea of an
earlier, more radical change.''

   Texas businessman Sid Bass, saying he
was repaying a debt he owed Yale University, announced Friday the
second $20 million contribution from his family in five months.
   The latest donation will be used to strengthen Yale's humanities
programs and to renovate two classroom buildings.
   ``It's a pleasure to repay a great debt I owe to this
university,'' Bass, a 1965 Yale Graduate and university trustee,
told a news conference. ``I am very proud that the humanities here
is so strong and it is my pleasure to emphasize that course of
interest at the university.''
   The school will use $5 million to endow five junior faculty
research fellowships that will enable non-tenured members of the
humanities faculty to pursue yearlong research projects.
   The university will use $10 million to renovate two Yale College
buildings and the remaining $5 million will be used to create
Yale's first classroom improvement endowment for future renovation
projects.
   In May, Sid Bass's brother, Edward, announced a $20 million gift
from the family to establish the Yale Institute of Biospheric
Studies to support study of the global environment.
   The Bass family has a fortune estimated at $5 billion by Fortune
Magazine. Sid Bass, 48, is president of Sid R. Bass Inc. of Fort
Worth, which has interests in oil, gas, real estate and
agriculture. Edward Bass is chairman and chief executive officer of
Fine Line Inc., a diversified venture and investment capital
company, and has numerous other business intrerests.
   The $40 million from the Bass family of Forth Worth, Texas, is
the biggest donation Yale has received since Paul Mellon, a 1929
graduate, contributed more than $12 million in 1966-67 to construct
the Yale Center for British Art and an art collection worth an
estimated $35 million.

   Saddam Hussein carried on talks with a top Soviet official
Friday while his foreign minister accused the United States and its
allies of pushing the world ``to the brink of a devastating war.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering called Iraq's address to the
General Assembly ``an insult to the Iraqi people, who deserve to be
told no more lies.''
   The United Nations speech, prepared by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz, was uncompromising, accusing the Security Council of
hypocrisy for criticizing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait while allowing
Israel to continue occupying Arab lands seized in the 1967 and 1973
wars.
   The speech came in response to President Bush's demand for Iraq
to end its 9-week-old occupation of neighboring Kuwait.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky later rebuked
Iraq, saying, ``We cannot but feel some satisfaction at the
unprecedented unity in the Security Council. ... That, we think, is
the promise that the United Nations can deal with this highly
dangerous international crisis.''
   In Washington, the State Department said about 300 Americans and
foreign-born family members have signed up for an evacuation flight
due to leave Kuwait on Wednesday. U.S. officials estimate at least
900 Americans remain trapped in Kuwait and Iraq following Saddam's
invasion of the oil-rich emirate Aug. 2.
   Aziz accused America and its allies of ``seeking to gain control
over the oil reserves in the gulf so as to have a free hand in
manipulating the needs of the world, and especially the needs of
the peoples of the Third World, for this important commodity.''
   The speech, delivered Friday afternoon by Iraq's second-ranked
U.N. representative, Sabah Talat Kadrat because Aziz was not in New
York, reiterated Saddam's view that all Middle East problems -
``Palestine, Lebanon, the gulf and others'' be considered on the
same basis and ``on an equal footing.''
   Kadrat stalked out of the hall later with the entire Iraqi
delegation when a Kuwaiti delegate, D. Razzooqi, replied that
``there are no falsifications of facts similar to what we have
heard from the representative of dictator Saddam Hussein.''
   ``We are going to return to Kuwait, God willing, we will
return,'' Razzooqi declared.
   Saudi Arabia's Ambassador Samir Shihabi accused Iraq of ``an
unforgivable crime, a crime to shine in the history of crimes'' by
``swallowing up other countries through looting, through pillage,
through invasion.
   Noting that Kuwait had helped finance Iraq during its war with
Iran in the 1980s, Shihabi said, ``It seems that Kuwait was feeding
a snake, a snake which would swallow up its neighbors.''
   Bush demanded an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait but
suggested before the world body Monday that there could be
``opportunities'' later to promote negotiations on Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Britain and France have made similar suggestions, which could
allow Saddam a face-saving exit from the oil-rich emirate.
   In Baghdad, Saddam met with an aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
accepted a message from the Soviet president. The official Iraqi
News Agency did not disclose the contents of the message.
   The news agency said Saddam and the Soviet envoy, Yevgeny
Primakov, discussed the gulf crisis and stressed ``the desire for
peace.'' Soviet diplomatic sources reported that Primakov urged
Saddam to cooperate with U.N. resolutions demanding the Iraqi
pullout.
   It was not clear if they discussed the plight of 5,000 Soviets
unable to leave Iraq. About 4,500 of the Soviets in Iraq are key
oil industry workers. Most are employed in new oil fields being
developed by Iraq.
   ``The Iraqis are now dependent on these oil people,'' a source
in Baghdad said on condition of anonymity. ``If they go, no one
else will come in to operate these fields.''
   Other Soviets in Iraq are military advisers who had been
training Iraqi soldiers in the use of Soviet-made weaponry and
other equipment. Moscow was Iraq's largest weapons supplier before
Aug. 2, but cut trade after the invasion.
   Meanwhile in Washington, five senators called for a Pentagon
investigation of how Iraq might have obtained the technology to
make fuel-air explosives for extremely powerful bombs that can
spread their blast over a wide area.
   The explosives have 10 times the power of conventional
explosives and create a huge fireball and shock wave over a
concentrated area, without the radiation fallout associated with
nuclear weapons, according to Pentagon officials.
   The senators are concerned that a German company,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, may have given away the formulas
needed to make the xplosives, which were used by U.S. forces in
Vietnam.
   Military officials say the United States has no ready defense
against the explosives, which could devastate oil fields, air bases
and troops, the newspaper reported.
   The United States now has 170,000 troops in Saudi Arabia and on
ships in the area, making up most of the estimated 200,000-member
international force. The Pentagon says Iraq has massed 460,000
troops in Kuwait since the invasion.

   A Dominican nun has decided to leave her
religious order to don judicial robes.
   Mary Ellen Fitzmaurice was sworn in Thursday as a Family Court
judge by Mayor David Dinkins.
   Fitzmaurice became the first nun in city history to become a
judge. The job required her to leave the order because ``church law
prohibits clergy ... to assume public offices which entail a
participation in the exercise of civil power,'' said a statement
from Sister Veronica Greeley, prioress of the Dominican Sisters of
Amityville.
   Sister Greeley said Fitzmaurice ``has decided to begin the
process of separation from her religious congregation.''
   The parting was apparently amicable. Sister Greeley described
the new judge as someone with ``intelligence, competence,
compassion and mercy'' who will make fine contributions to the
court.
   Fitzmaurice, 41, has been practicing law for 10 years, serving
as a law guardian in Queens Family Court and an attorney with the
Human Resources Administration.
   She refused to speak to reporters at the swearing-in ceremony.

   Former Atlanta Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, who
resigned this sumrates for the rich.
   To boost pressure on budget writers to forge a spending plan for
the five-day-old fiscal year, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush would not sign any such temporary financing
bill.
   ``We would close down the government at midnight'' Friday unless
Congress completes a broad budget outline by then, Fitzwater said.
   Only those services needed to ``protect life and property'' will
be permitted in the absence of a budget, White House budget
director Richard Darman wrote in a memo to agency chiefs.
   With the long weekend about to start, it seemed likely that the
full brunt of the shutdown would not be felt until Tuesday. But the
Park Service was preparing to close the Statue of Liberty, the
Washington Monument and other tourist favorites, at least for the
weekend.
   Most of the nation's 2.4 million federal workers were told to
report on Tuesday - after Monday's federal holiday - even if only
to be sent home after they arrived.
   Congressional leaders of both parties met with administration
officials to grope for a deficit-cutting plan that would be
acceptable to lawmakers just a month shy of Election Day.
   Democrats sought support for a new plan with fewer cuts for the
elderly and the poor, but there were no signs that Republicans were
willing to accept it.
   Democrats also said they would be willing to consider cuts in
the capital gains tax rate, a Republican proposal, in exchange for
higher taxes for the rich. Budget negotiators had rejected the
tradeoff last week.
   Earlier, in a Thursday night session that stretched into Friday
morning, a rebellious House overwhelmingly defeated the
$500-billion compromise package of tax boosts and spending slashes
that Bush and congressional leaders preferred.
   That vote was an embarrassment to administration officials and
top lawmakers of both parties, who had waged an all-out lobbying
thrust on behalf of the measure. Uncertainty reigned on Capitol
Hill.
   ``This thing could be - who knows?'' said a confused Rep. Robert
Matsui, D-Calif.
   The president has 10 days to decide whether to sign a bill he is
sent by Congress. Until a measure is signed, it does not become
law.
   Democrats hoped that by sending the emergency spending bill to
Bush, the president - and not Congress - would be blamed for the
closure.
   But lawmakers of both parties agreed that all sides looked bad
in light of the seemingly endless budget battle.
   Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., tugged on a tie bearing a Mickey
Mouse pattern and said, ``Everybody ought to have these on today.''
   The House's 254-179 rejection of the budget was driven by
unhappiness among members of all stripes. Conservatives disliked
its $134 billion in taxes and as well as its spending cuts they
considered overly gentle.
   Liberals thought the $60 billion in Medicare reductions,
including cuts in benefits, were too steep. They said the plan's
higher levies on gasoline, heating oil, tobacco and alcohol would
hit the poor too hard.
   And members of both parties said they resented the process by
which the package was written - four months of closed-door summit
talks involving only congressional leaders and administration
officials.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he believed that as a result,
lawmakers should try to write a budget themselves, perhaps with
reduced Medicare cuts and a lesser tax burden for low-income
people.
   ``We will, of course, keep in touch with the White House, but I
do not anticipate ... the resumption of anything that would be
called summit talks,'' he said.
   Foley said he wanted a budget that would be supported by a
majority of Democrats and Republicans. ``I am not of the opinion
that political warfare is of some value at this point,'' he said.
   But not all lawmakers agreed. Conservative Republicans urged
Bush to keep the government shut down until Democrats agreed to
limit federal spending.
   ``A budget plan ought to be put together by the president in
consultation with Republicans,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
``Tell the Democrats to put up their best shot. We'll sustain every
veto he's got.''

   An unarmed Soviet man forced an
Aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight with 26 people aboard to
land in Finland on Friday and then asked for political asylum.
   The Soviet Embassy requested the extradition of the 40-year-old
hijacker, identified by police as Nikolai Ivanovich Selivanov, the
Foreign Ministry said.
   The hijacker surrendered soon after the 28-seat Yak-40 aircraft
touched down, police said. None of the 21 other passengers or four
crew members was hurt, and the plane flew to Leningrad later Friday
evening.
   The hijacker walked out of the plane to meet Finnish police, who
took him to central Helsinki for interrogation.
   Passengers said the man used no violence to hijack the plane but
warned them it would explode if something happened to him. One
passenger said the hijacker claimed to have recently left a mental
institution.
   ``The hijacker wanted to go to Stockholm, but he was told there
was not enough fuel,'' Chief Inspector Pertti Virolainen told a
news conference.
   The small aircraft landed in Helsinki two hours after takeoff
from Novgorod, 310 miles northwest of Moscow. It was on its way to
Petrozavodsk via Leningrad.
   ``Fifteen minutes after we took off, a thin, pale
nervous-looking man walked up to the hostess and handed her a
note,'' said Yevgeni Khodorkovsky, a 32-year-old passenger.
   Passengers said the hijacker walked up and down the aisle of the
plane and visited the toilet several times.
   ``He kept on looking out of the windows and when he saw the
islands below he smiled,'' said passenger Antonina Urjetskaya, 68,
of Novgorod.
   ``I heard the hijacker saying that he had a friend on board and
if something happens to him then his friend would blow up the
plane,'' Mrs. Urjetskaya said.
   The hijacker mentioned no motive for the hijacking except
``rather unclear, strange circumstances in his life,'' Khodorovsky
said.
   ``He said he had been unemployed for six months, that his father
was an invalid and he had just come out of a mental institution.''
   The passengers included a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old child.
   ``All the passengers were of course very worried and we passed
the two children from lap to lap so that they wouldn't run in the
aisle,'' Mrs. Urjetskaya said.
   ``My heart is in bad shape so I was very worried, but I took a
heart pill and I am very glad that the situation ended so well,''
she said.
   When the hijacker left the plane, she said, he announced he knew
he had done something wrong, but would rather be in jail in Sweden,
than in the Soviet Union. An air hostess had announced that the
plane was landing in Stockholm.
   The passengers were taken by bus to an airport personnel
cafeteria where they were interviewed by police.
   A Soviet Embassy official at the airport asked if anyone else
wanted to stay in Finland, Khodorkovsky said. ``The official's
request was met with laughter.''
   Khodorkovsky, of Leningrad, said he and his wife had received
exit visas to emigrate to Israel.
   Earlier this year, five domestic planes were hijacked to Finland
and to Sweden by young men who said they were political dissidents
or fugitives from the Soviet army.
   Swedish and Finnish officials extradited four of them. One was
given political asylum in Sweden.

   The families of four people killed in the 1987
crash of a Continental Airlines jet in Denver will share $10
million in an out-of-court settlement, a lawyer says.
   Plaintiffs' Attorney Michael Sydow said Thursday the case
against the airline was settled a few hours before it was scheduled
to go to court on Monday.
   But Continental spokesman Ned Walker said Friday the settlement
reached this week involved the family of just one victim. The other
three settled about eight months ago, Walker said.
   Sydow was in court Friday and unavailable to answer questions
about the discrepancy, an assistant said.
   Walker declined to give the amount of the settlement, which he
noted will actually be paid for Continental by the airline's
insurance company, United States Aviation Insurance Group of New
York.
   Twenty-eight people died and 54 were injured when the
Continental DC-9 crashed while attempting to take off in a
snowstorm at Stapleton International Airport on Nov. 15, 1987.
   The Houston-based carrier already has paid more than $20 million
to settle 36 other crash-related cases, lawyers said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled the crash was
caused by a combination of weather factors and pilot errors.
   The NTSB noted that the first officer, who was at the controls
and killed in the crash, had little flight time on DC-9s.
Investigators also noted that the takeoff came 27 minutes after the
jet was last de-iced.
   Sydow said $4.5 million will go to Mary Cook of Boise, Idaho,
and her daughter, Kay Gosse. Mrs. Cook's husband, Richard Cook,
died in the crash, Sydow said.
   Helen Hideshima of Denver will receive $2.5 million for the
death of her husband, Mako Hideshima; Byron Owens of Nyssa, Wash.,
will get $750,000 for the death of his wife, Terry; and David
Daniel of Nampa, Idaho, $2.2 million for the loss of his wife,
Tamara, the attorney said. Daniel was seated next to his wife in
the plane.
   Sydow has two remaining cases filed on behalf of families of
crash victims pending against Continental.

   Archaeologists are uncovering more graves of freed
slaves than they originally believed were beneath a city park in
the path of a freeway-widening project.
   Officials originally believed Freedman's Cemetery contained less
than 100 graves. But new excavations, prompted by the widening of
Dallas' Central Expressway, have uncovered about 1,100 graves, said
archaeologist Jerry Henderson.
   Officials now estimate that more than 2,000 slaves and freed
slaves were buried in the cemetery, which operated from 1861 to
1925. The cemetery was largely forgotten and covered by the park,
and recently was rediscovered because of the freeway widening
project.
   The project threatens about 150 known graves, but Ms. Henderson
said workers could find up to 800 graves that must be moved to make
way for the new road.
   Scientists hope to catalog the vital statistics of 800 bodies
before reburying them to learn more about the slaves' lives, said
Jerome Rose, chairman of the University of Arkansas anthropology
department.
   ``I think it would ba a fantastic contribution to Afro-American
history,'' Rose said.

   An art gallery and its director were acquitted
Friday of obscenity charges by a jury that rejected prosecution
claims that sexually graphic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe lacked
artistic value.
   The two-week obscenity trial was the nation's first of an art
gallery.
   ``What a great day!'' gallery director Dennis Barrie told
reporters.
   The jury of four men and four women returned the verdicts after
slightly more than two hours.
   Barrie smiled slightly as a clerk read the verdict. When the
clerk finished, Barrie smiled broadly, said ``All right!'' turned
in his chair and hugged his attorney, H. Louis Sirkin.
   Spectators in the Hamilton County Municipal Court room shouted
and applauded. The jurors were ushered out of the courtroom.
   Judge David Albanese expelled gallery board Chairman Roger Ach
and Robert Allen, whose video production company sponsored the
exhibit, when they jumped out of their seats to hug Barrie.
   The jury cleared the Contemporary Art Center and Barrie of
misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and using children in
nudity-related material. Barrie could have been sentenced to one
year in jail and fined $2,000, and the gallery fined $10,000, if
convicted on both counts.
   ``Obviously, this is a very emotional moment. It's been a very
hard time for me,'' Barrie said. ``We did something very important
for this city. We stood up for the First Amendment.
   ``This is a major battle fought here today. It's a major battle
for the arts and for freedom of expression in America.''
   However, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, whose American Family
Association in Tupelo, Miss., has fought National Endowment for the
Arts funding for exhibits such as Mapplethorpe's, said: ``This is
not a landmark, Pearl Harbor decision. This was just another
obscenity trial. ...
   ``I think this really puts the NEA issue right back in the
political arena where it belongs.''
   In closing arguments, defense attorneys contended there was no
basis for the charges of using children in nudity-related material
since the mothers of the children gave their consent. The
prosecution contended that consent was not in writing when the
exhibit opened.
   The defense also noted the U.S. Supreme Court's three-pronged
test of obscenity: Material must appeal to a prurient interest in
sex, be patently offensive according to contemporary community
standards and must lack redeeming artistic, scientific or political
value.
   ``The jury has made its decision. We accept it,'' said Frank
Prouty, assistant city prosecutor.
   During closing arguments, Prouty told jury members it was up to
them to decide the artistic merit of the photographs.
   ``Are these Van Goghs, these five pictures?,'' he asked.
   ``A forearm rammed up a rectum - that's art? A finger stuck in
the head of a penis - is that art? A canister ... or something ...
stuck up your rectum - is that art? Another picture where you have
a man urinating into another man's mouth - is that art?''
   The fifth photo is a self-portrait of Mapplethorpe with a
bullwhip in his rectum.
   ``All five pictures - think of it - art?'' Prouty asked.
   He told the jury to judge what they considered to be art using
contemporary community standards, not the standards of art experts
who testified for the defense.
   Prouty recited the fable of the vain emperor who, although
naked, believed he was fully clothed because his subjects praised
his imaginary clothing.
   ``The art world wants to tell you these are art. And the
townspeople sat there and watched the emperor walk down the street
without any clothes on, but yet all his advisers told him `You have
a beautiful coat,' because nobody wanted to come out and tell them
that it's not art.
   ``You are the townspeople. Don't let somebody from outside come
in and say it is art. You say whether these five pictures are like
the emperor without any clothes on.''
   Sirkin, Barrie's attorney, said the five photos no doubt
offended some people but had serious artistic merit.
   He quoted from a speech by John Kennedy:
   ``Society must set the artist free to follow his vision,
wherever it takes him. We must never forget that art is not a form
of propaganda. It is a form of truth. The highest duty of the
writer, the composer, the artist, is to remain true to himself.''
   ``That's exactly what Dennis Barrie did,'' Sirkin said. ``He
wanted to share with this community a beauty that he felt was shown
by an artist, Mr. Mapplethorpe.''
   Sirkin reminded jurors that the same exhibit was shown in
Philadelphia, Chicago and Berkeley, Calif., without incident.
   ``Is Cincinnati that different? Are we that childish? Are we not
big enough to say we can't accept what other cities have seen?''
Sirkin asked.
   Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe was an
accomplished and respected photographer, and that photographs of
the children were morally and sexually innocent. Mapplethorpe died
last year of AIDS at age 42.
   The exhibit drew 81,000 people during its seven-week run last
spring, an attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It
closed Friday in Boston, where 103,000 tickets were sold.
   Attorney Marc Mezibov, representing the gallery, said the state
failed to prove its case. No presentation was made to back up the
assertion that the photographs were not legitimate art.
   ``Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic
value? Don't you think that if there were people out there who
thought that, the state of Ohio would have found them?'' Mezibov
asked.

<TEXT>
   This financially troubled city sued
a judge who gave away City Hall to pay a debt, but the new owner's
lawyer says the property's already been sold.
   The suit, filed Friday in federal court, seeks to reverse the
Sept. 27 county circuit court ruling awarding City Hall and some
other city land to the guardians of a man who won a $3.4 million
judgment after being injured in the city jail.
   Mayor Carl Officer contends in the $125 million lawsuit that the
ruling by St. Clair County Circuit Judge Roger Scrivner was part of
a pattern of racism against the predominantly black city. The mayor
also called for a U.S. Senate investigation of the circuit court.
   The mayor's suit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the
people of East St. Louis, alleged the circuit court ``has engaged
in a pattern and practice of racially motivated conduct that has
deprived the city of East St. Louis and its citizens of due process
of law.''
   The mayor also asked the circuit court to reconsider Scrivner's
decision and bar him from handling other cases involving the city,
said City Attorney Eric Vickers
   Scrivner awarded City Hall and a piece of city-owned industrial
property to Walter DeBow, 55, who suffered permanent brain damage
after being beaten into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city
jail more than six years ago. DeBow has no short-term memory and is
being cared for at a head-injury rehabilitation center in New
Jersey.
   Calls for comment to Scrivner and the chief judge of the court
weren't returned Friday.
   DeBow's attorney, Clyde Kuehn, said Friday he'd already made a
deal to sell City Hall. He refused to name the prospective buyer or
give the price.
   Kuehn said Scrivner's ruling was the only way to get the city to
pay its debt to DeBow - about $4 million because of interest.
   ``The rights that were enforced in circuit court were the rights
of a black man, and a good guy too,'' said attorney Clyde Kuehn,
referring to the allegation of racism. ``You can win a $4 million
verdict, but you don't win until they pay.''
   DeBow, who was in jail on charges of illegally transporting
alcohol when the beating occurred, needs the money to pay for his
$325-per-day care, his family said.
   The city's lawsuit seeks $25 million in actual damages and $100
million in punitive damages.
   The St. Clair County Recorder of Deeds said Friday the property
was placed in a trust Oct. 1, with Eric Rhein as guardian. A phone
call to Rhein's Belleville law office was not immediately returned.
   City Hall is worth about $10 million, Vickers has said. And city
officials had been negotiating with a company to buy the other
piece of property for $5 million to build a trash recycling plant.
   East St. Louis is plagued by debt estimated at $47 million. Gov.
James R. Thompson signed a $34 million bailout bill Aug. 30. The
money will come from state bond issues.
   The population of the city, which has one of the nation's
highest murder rates, fell from 55,000 in 1980 to 40,000 this year,
the Census Bureau estimates.
   Selling the property rids DeBow of responsibility for paying
property taxes, which could be as high as $400,000 annually on City
Hall alone, Kuehn said Thursday.
   It also eliminates potential liability for injuries on the
property, he said.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of events in the
obscenity case based on photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe:
   -April 1987-Dec. 1988: Mapplethorpe assembles an exhibition
called ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment'' in consultation
with Janet Kardon, curator of the Institute for Contemporary Art in
Philadelphia.
   -Oct. 1988: Dennis Barrie, the director of the Contemporary Arts
Center in Cincinnati, decides to host the show, calling the photos
``the most stunning photographic show I'd seen in years.''
   -March 1989: Mapplethorpe dies at age 42 of AIDS in Boston.
   -June 1989: The Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., cancels a
planned Mapplethorpe exhibition. The gallery director says she
acted to defuse debate over government support to the arts.
   -March 16, 1990: Hamilton County Sheriff Simon L. Leis Jr. says
in an interview that he considers parts of the planned 175-picture
exhibition legally obscene and says he plans to take legal action
if Cincinnati police don't act.
   -March 27: The Contemporary Arts Center files a lawsuit seeking
a court ruling on whether the pictures are obscene before the
exhibition opens.
   -April 2: Cincinnati police vice officers review the
Mapplethorpe exhibition at the gallery's request, but decline to
file charges.
   -April 6: A Hamilton County Municipal Court judge dismisses the
gallery's lawsuit. The exhibition opens with a private showing to
more than 4,000 dues-paying gallery patrons.
   -April 7: The exhibition opens to the public, and more than
8,000 see it the first day. A county grand jury indicts the
Contemporary Arts Center and Barrie on misdemeanor counts of
pandering obscenity and using children in material involving
nudity. The indictment covers five pictures depicting sex acts and
two showing children with their genitals exposed.
   -April 8: U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin issues an injunction
barring police from seizing the photographs at the gallery.
   -April 16: Barrie and the Contemporary Arts Center plead
innocent before Judge David J. Albanese in Hamilton County
Municipal Court.
   -April 19: County Prosecutor Arthur M. Ney turns the case over
to city prosecutors, saying his office cannot handle it because it
involves only misdemeanor charges.
   -April 23: The Association of Art Museum Directors, which
represents directors of 176 museum directors in the United States
and Canada, promises to pay any fine imposed on Barrie and the
Contemporary Arts Center.
   -May 26: The exhibition closes after more than 81,000 people pay
to see it, making it the largest arts event in Cincinnati history.
   -June 20: Albanese, rejecting defense arguments that the
artistic quality of two pictures of children make them immune from
child-nudity law, orders Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on the child-nudity charge.
   -Aug. 1: The exhibit opens in Boston at the Institute for
Contemporary Art.
   -Sept. 5, 1990: A Municipal Court clerk in Boston refuses a
request by critics of the show to file obscenity charges.
   -Sept. 6: Albanese rules that jurors in Barrie's trial will
consider only the seven photos named in the indictment, saying they
need to find that only one of the pictures is obscene to return a
conviction. The judge orders Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on the obscenity charge.
   -Sept. 24, 1990: The trial begins.

testifies that the photos of sex acts lack artistic value and that
the photos of the children could encourage child abuse.
   -Oct. 5: Jurors deliberate just two hours before finding Barrie
and the Contemporary Arts Center innocent on all charges. The
exhibit closes in Boston, after 103,000 people paid to see the
photographs.

   A Republican group agreed Friday it will
no longer use a controversial fund-raising technique in Alabama,
said the state attorney general and the GOP organization.
   Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman said he will abandon a
lawsuit against the Republican Presidential Task Force, which
mailed about 1 million fund-raising letters nationwide in August
and early September. The task force is a fund-raising program of
the Washington-based National Republican Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   Each three-page letter from the task force contained a $25 check
and a three-page letter explaining that by depositing the check,
the recipient agreed to have $12.50 a month automatically
transferred to the Republicans' Candidate Support Program.
   The letters said a person could cancel after two months. If not,
the withdrawals would continue. The back of the $25 check
reiterated the automatic withdrawal, but Siegelman said the print
was so small one could hardly read it.
   ``Solicitations which could trick people into making involuntary
contributions must not be tolerated,'' Siegelman said in a prepared
statement.
   The attorney general said he agreed to drop his lawsuit after
receiving a commitment from the group not to send letters to
Alabama in the future.
   In addition, the group will send to each person who received the
original letter another letter stating that monthly contributions
of $12.50 are being withdrawn from their bank accounts.
   Task force spokeswoman Wendy Burnley confirmed Friday night that
an agreement had been reached and that it applied only to the
specific mailing made to Alabama voters.
   Siegelman said the case began with a complaint from the daughter
of a 76-year-old Hamilton woman who was prepared to deposit the
check before her daughter examined it carefully.
   Burnley has acknowledged that the letter prompted complaints in
at least six states. State officials in New Jersey and Illinois
have filed suit. Attorneys general of Oregon, Minnesota and
Michigan have complained.
   Burnley said Friday night that the group will have discussions
with the attorneys general in Oregon, Minnesota and Michigan after
the November elections.
   She said the Illinois suit is pending and that there will be a
court proceeding next month in the New Jersey suit.

<TEXT>
   A follower of the late guru Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh was arrested in Germany in a plot to kill the chief
federal prosecutor in Oregon, authorities said Friday.
   Carol Matthews, 40, a New York native also known as Prem
Samadhi, was arrested Thursday by police in Baden Baden, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Baron C. Sheldahl said.
   ``We are beginning the extradition process,'' Sheldahl said,
adding that it would be months before Matthews could be returned to
the United States.
   Matthews is one of three Rajneeshees being held in Germany in
connection with an alleged wiretapping scheme and a conspiracy to
kill U.S. Attorney Charles H. Turner during 1985 and 1986 at
Rajneeshpuram, the sect's former commune in central Oregon.
   Federal prosecutors said Anand Sheela, who as the guru's
secretary led the sect, devised the murder plot because she
believed it would derail state and federal investigations for
immigration fraud and other offenses.
   Sheela left the United States in December 1988 after serving 29
months in a California prison for crimes related to the sect's
activities in Oregon.
   They included the poisoning of 750 people by contaminating salad
bars in The Dalles with salmonella bacteria cultivated in the
sect's laboratory, the operation of a wiretapping scheme that
intercepted all telephone calls in Rajneeshpuram, and immigration
fraud.
   Matthews is the fifth Rajneeshee arrested within the past month
in connection with the alleged plot. Catherine Jane Stubbs, 45, a
native of Australia; and Richard Kevin Langford, 40, a native of
Syracuse, N.Y., were arrested three weeks ago in West Germany. Ann
Phyllis McCarthy, 43, a German native, was arrested in South
Africa. British citizen Susan Lissanevitch, 43, was arrested in
England.
   Sheela has not yet been arrested in the plot, although Turner
said recently that authorities have a ``pretty good idea'' of her
whereabouts.

   A class-action lawsuit accusing Southwest Airlines
of discriminating against older pilots was filed by the U.S. Equal
Opportunity Commission on Friday.
   The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court, alleges that
Southwest has not hired a pilot older than 45 since 1987.
   Southwest Airlines, which serves 13 states, employs 800 pilots.
   A spokesman for Southwest denied the allegations.
   ``We think their statistics are simply incorrect,'' said Jim
Parker, vice president and general counsel for Southwest Airlines.
   Since 1987, Southwest Airlines has hired 39 pilots over 45,
Parker said.

<DATELINE>WARWICK, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles J. Donovan is running against
Republican Lincoln Chafee in the mayor's race, but the Democrat
seems to be taking on the entire Chafee clan.
   Donovan, a state senator, ran an ad in the Warwick Beacon
blasting not only Chafee but the Republican's father, Sen. John
Chafee, his brother, assistant U.S. Attorney Zechariah Chafee, and
two of his cousins - independent Providence mayoral candidate Fred
Lippitt and Duncan H. Doolittle, a former DiPrete administration
official.
   Donovan criticized the Chafees and their cousins for collecting
state or federal pensions and working in what the Democrat called
``patronage'' jobs.
   ``The apple doesn't fall far from the family tree,'' the ad
said. It pictured the heads of all five men as apples hanging from
a tree.
   ``A little desperate over there,'' Zechariah Chafee said.
   ``Gosh,'' said Edward Quinlan, Sen. Chafee's spokesman. ``Fred
Lippitt is running for mayor of Providence.''
   ``I wonder if he's forgotten where he's running,'' said
Lippitt's campaign manager, Richard White.
   Donovan stood by the ad, but said he had no gripe with Sen.
Chafee.
   ``I really do kind of like his father,'' he said, ``but issues
are different than personalities.''
   Lincoln Chafee said the ad was incorrect because it implied that
he receives a city pension for his service as councilman and that
his brother gets a federal pension. Both said they were still
ineligible.
   Sen. Chafee, who will turn 68 this month, started receiving a
state pension of $6,200 a year at age 60 after serving six years in
the Rhode Island House and three terms as governor, Quinlan said.
   The ad, which ran Thursday, made no mention of Donovan's state
pension. Donovan, 52, receives $34,271 after taking early
retirement this year from his 20-year job with the state school
lunch program, and a $4,800 pension for his time in the
legislature.

<HEAD>An ``American Dream'' That Will Be Tough to Sell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``American Dream,'' an emotional, uncompromising
documentary of the Hormel meatpackers strike in the mid-1980s, is
very much hot off the presses.
   It was completed the day before its screening Thursday at the
New York Film Festival, and the director hopes the success of
``Roger and Me'' means there's an audience for her film, too.
   But it will be a tough sell for Barbara Kopple, whose 1976
movie, ``Harlan County U.S.A.,'' won an Academy Award for best
feature documentary. ``American Dream'' tells a bleak story, with
little of the irony and dark humor that made ``Roger and Me'' so
entertaining despite its account of corporate greed and
indifference in Flint, Mich.
   Speaking at a press conference at the festival, where the movie
received an extended ovation, Kopple spoke of the years she spent
in Austin, Minn., the location of the strike, and her desire to
gain national attention for the documentary.
   ``I think `Roger and Me' is a film that takes a different look
at the problems of working people and I enjoyed it very much,''
said Kopple, whose other films include ``No Nukes'' and ``Civil
Rights: The Struggle Continues.''
   ``I just want to follow in its footsteps,'' she said.
   The film begins in 1984 with Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co. asking workers
to accept wage cuts although the company was turning a profit.
Hormel, which said it needed the reductions to remain competitive,
had enjoyed good relations with workers over the years and several
plants agreed to the concessions.
   But Austin's Local P-9 of the United Food and Commercial Workers
decided to fight. Ray Rogers, a maverick consultant known for
organizing J.P. Stevens textile mills in the South, was recruited
and the union followed his policy of confrontation.
   Hormel would not back down, and on Aug. 17, 1985, the nearly
1,500 members of Local P-9 walked off their jobs. The national
union urged Rogers and P-9 President Jim Guyette to negotiate, but
they angrily refused and most of the workers supported them.
   The strike dragged on for months and became increasingly bitter.
Workers lashed out at Hormel and fought with each other as the
company filled their jobs with replacement workers. Some employees,
their strike fund cut off by the national union, crossed the picket
lines.
   Hormel eventually returned the plant to full capacity and most
of the strikers never returned to work. Some remain in Austin,
others looked for jobs elsewhere.
   Kopple had access to local and national union officials. She
shows meatpackers breaking down and crying and lifelong friendships
being destroyed. There is a brief moment of humor, a closeup of a
billboard reading: ``Enjoy Austin: Where the Good Life Is Here to
Stay.''
   ``There was a lot of media there for the strike,'' Koppel said,
``but I'm not a newsperson. I have a much more personal style. I
wanted to get inside people's heads. I'm very sympathetic to
people's making decent wages and wanted to make an explanation of
what happened.''

   A sculpture of St. George slaying a dragon
made from the wreckage of American and Soviet nuclear missiles was
dedicated Friday on the grounds of the United Nations.
   ``The nuclear dragon is the ultimate evil,'' said Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at a ceremony attended by U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker III, U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and the artist, Zurab Tsereteli.
   ``Here are these monsters, born not of the artist's imagination,
but of the cruel realities of our time, the Pershing and SS-20
nuclear missiles,'' Shevardnadze added. ``They have been beheaded
and destroyed not by the artist's fantasy but by the will of the
governments and people of those countries where they once came into
being.''
   The 39-foot-high monument depicts in bronze St. George atop a
rearing horse. Holding a long pole topped by a tiny cross, the
rider spears broken SS-20 and Pershing missiles. The missiles form
the body of a two-headed dragon.
   Entitled ``Good Defeats Evil,'' it weighs 40 tons.
   Pershing and SS-20 missiles were dismantled under the
Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was signed Dec. 8,
1987, by President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Shevardnadze said his country was giving the sculpture to the
United Nations in honor of its 45th anniversary, which is
celebrated this month.
   Tsereteli told several hundred people who gathered at the
sculpture dedication that he got the idea for the monument in a
dream in which St. George was slaying dragons made from missiles.
   After the INF treaty was signed, Tsereteli got hold of some
actual missile parts and gave them to an international group of
children who were attending an art workshop with Soviet children in
his native Georgia.
   ``The children destroyed these missiles,'' he said, explaining
that observing the children helped inspire him.
   Tsereteli, 56, is the Soviet Union's artist laureate and has
been named People's Artist of the U.S.S.R. In 1976, he was awarded
the Lenin Prize, which honors contributions to culture.
   With his 12-year-old grandson, Vaseli Tsereteli, the artist
placed a bright yellow bow with long streamers on the green
sculpture. Tsereteli said this symbolized his hope for peace in the
Middle East and fulfilled the dream in which he visualized the
sculpture as green and yellow.

   Nine more lobbyists were subpoenaed
Friday in a growing criminal investigation into lawmaker ethics,
while a prominent state senator amended a disclosure report to
include three 1989 trips.
   Assistant State Attorney Anthony Guarisco ordered the lobbyists
to produce records of every occasion they spent more than $100 on a
legislator over the past five years. The subpoenas are identical to
those already issued to a half-dozen others.
   ``We're not through yet,'' Guarisco said. ``This thing will
continue, and we'll go through as many as we can get to.''
   The investigation is aimed at finding legislators who accepted
gifts, travel and other perquisites from lobbyists worth over $100
but failed to report them as required.
   Sen. Gwen Margolis, a North Miami Beach Democrat who could
become Senate president after the November elections, sent a letter
to the Division of Elections this week amending her financial
disclosure reports. She disclosed 1989 trips to Chicago, the
Bahamas and to Moscow - all paid for by others.
   Margolis couldn't be reached for comment Friday, but she has
said she was confused about whether they should have been included.
   All but two of the lobbyists subpoenaed Friday appeared in a St.
Petersburg Times story Sunday that described some of the biggest
spenders among the 4,000 Florida legislative lobbyists. Guarisco
confirmed prosecutors used the story as a guide.
   Those subpoenaed have a wide variety of clients in such fields
as tourism, alcoholic beverages, insurance and other industries.
They often spent money on legislators by providing hunting trips.

<TEXT>
   Boston Celtic basketball player Dee
Brown says he plans to move to this affluent Boston suburb, even
though police interrupted his house-hunting trip by holding him at
gunpoint on the ground.
   Brown, who is black, was confronted Sept. 21 by officers seeking
a black bank robbery suspect.
   ``I'm going to make my home in Wellesley,'' Brown told WBZ-TV in
Boston in interview broadcast Friday.
   But Brown also authorized his lawyer to consider filing suit
against the town, after private negotiations failed to work out a
settlement over his detention by police.
   ``The town has chosen the position that racism was not a factor
and that all of the police procedures were proper and correct,''
Brown's attorney, Alan Margolies said, in an news release. ``We
disagree.''
   Margolies said he had offered the town a deal to resolve the
case, but was rebuffed. He did not return telephone calls seeking
details of his settlement proposal, nor would Wellesley officials
disclose it.
   However, town officials said they were surprised by the
attorney's announcement that talks had broken off.
   ``My understanding is and always has been that we were having
ongoing discussions,'' said Barbara Shanahan, chairman of the
Wellesley Board of Selectmen. ``We want to make things right.''
   In two meetings with Margolies on Sept. 24 and Thursday,
Shanahan said officials promised to bring in Justice Department
experts on race relations to talk with residents and police. Blacks
make up less than two percent of the town's population, according
to state estimates.
   Brown, 21, is the Celtics' top draft choice. The 6-foot-1 point
guard participated in the first day of training camp Friday.
   Brown said he had received letters and petitions from Wellesley
residents asking him to move there.
   ``You don't want a rap like that on your town, that every time a
black person (or) a suspicious person or everybody that doesn't
look like a Wellesley citizen, you have to check them or ID them,''
Brown said.
   Shanahan said she was ``delighted'' that Brown was moving to
Wellesley.
   ``He will be warmly welcomed,'' she said.

   School officials raised a stink and
handed a pair of smelly students three-day suspensions for eating
too much garlic.
   Lake Worth High School juniors Paul Martikainen, 16, and Tomi
Ilves, a 17-year-old vegetarian, were intrigued by tales of
garlic's power to cleanse blood and keep blood pressure down.
   So the pair said they each munched half a garlic head Wednesday
night and three or four heads each for breakfast Thursday.
   Classmates and teachers weren't pleased by the aroma.
   One instructor told the boys twice to stop eating garlic at
school, Principal David Cantley said. By third period, they were
sent to the office.
   ``This isn't like we were doing it on purpose to get anybody
mad,'' Martikainen said. ``We were blowing in each other's face,
and we couldn't sense a garlic smell.''
   School Board counsel Abbey Hairston said the suspensions are
appropriate because ``there was some disruption and some complaints
that those students were odoriferous.''
   The Fresh Garlic Association in Sausalito, Calif., says studies
show garlic may improve circulation and lower cholesterol.
   ``But there is one thing they recommend, and that is not to
overdo it,'' association spokesperson Caryl Saunders said.

   About 500 Belgian paratroopers were flown
into Belgium's former colony of Rwanda on Friday in a bid with
French forces to quash a rebel uprising, authorities said.
   Diplomats from Kigali, Rwanda's capital, said small-arms and
artillery fire that broke out overnight in the city outskirts had
died down later Friday.
   French military officials in Paris said its forces engaged in
defensive fire early Friday against armed men while tightening
ranks around the French Embassy.
   The French soldiers ``were obliged to ripost, in a purely
defensive manner'' to ``armed elements,'' the army press service
said. It said it was not known whether there were casualties.
   The French Defense Ministry denied as ``absolutely false''
reports that its forces engaged in gunfire around the airport at
Kigali.
   The scattered shooting in this impoverished country in central
East Africa marked the sixth day of unrest since the rebel force
made up of Rwandan refugees invaded from neighboring Uganda.
   Diplomats from Kigali, a city of about 160,000 residents, said
the French and Belgian forces were helping Rwandan forces maintain
control of the capital.
   The French Defense Ministry said its troops, 150 sent Friday in
addition to 150 dispatched earlier, were there only to protect
French citizens and the diplomatic mission.
   Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme said four companies of
paratropers, or about 500 men, arms and vehicles were being flown
in.
   Coeme said the Belgian troops would cntrol Kigali airport and
roads around it. He declined to give more details.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the arrival of the French and
Belgian troops had bolstered the morale of government troops in the
mountainous nation the size of Marlyand.
   ``They're happy to see that their friends are backing them up in
their time of need,'' Tom Martin, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in
Kigali, told CNN in a phone interview.
   ``It's also made a big difference for all the expatriates,'' he
said. ``It's made everybody feel a lot safer, not just the Belgian
and French citizens who the troops were sent in to protect.''
   Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, in an afternoon address
broadcast nationwide, said government forces were in ``full
control'' of the situation.
   According to Martin, the dissent is over the poor economic
conditions of Rwanda, which has suffered from declining world
prices for its main export crop, coffee, as well as food shortages
and tribal conflict.
   Martin said support for the rebels appeared limited.
   Diplomats, interviewed by telephone on condition of anonymity,
said it appeared no foreigners had been hurt in the unrest. An
estimated 250 Americans are in the country of 6.7 million
residents, including tourists.
   ``It looks like the French, Belgians and Rwanda militias have
things under control,'' one diplomat said. ``However, the streets
still are not safe.''
   There are an estimated 670 Frenchmen in Rwanda, and Radio France
Internationale said the French Embassy was arranging for 200
citizens to fly out of Rwanda, perhaps as early as Friday night.
   In Bonn, the government said some of the 400 German nationals in
Rwanda would be evacuated on planes, and others in truck and car
convoys to neighboring Burundi or Zaire.
   Belgium rushed paratroopers and military equipment said to
include two C-130 transport aircraft to Rwanda to protect its 1,630
citizens there.
   The rebels, Rwandan refugees mostly from the minority Tutsi
tribe, invaded across the northern border with Uganda on Sunday.
Many deserted from Uganda's army. Estimates of the size of the
invading force have ranged from several hundred to several
thousand.
   Rwanda's government Friday urged people to stay indoors and
banned gatherings of more than two people and unauthorized travel.
A dusk-to-dawn curfew ordered Tuesday remained in effect.
   Rwanda's Habyarimana, of the majority Hutu tribe, has ruled
Rwanda since seizing control in a bloodless 1973 coup.

<HEAD>Defense Rests in Miller Spy Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense rested in the third sex-for
spying trial of Richard W. Miller without calling the former FBI
agent to testify.
   Miller's lawyer, Joel Levine, said he didn't put Miller on the
stand in U.S. District Court because he suffers from auditory
dyslexia, a condition that affects his verbal abilities in
stressful situations.
   Judge Robert M. Takasugi is hearing the case without a jury.
Closing arguments were expected Tuesday.
   Miller did not testify in his first trial, which ended in a hung
jury, nor in his second trial, which ended in him being sentenced
to life in prison. A federal appeals court overturned the
conviction.
   Miller, the only FBI agent ever charged with betraying his
country, did testify in pretrial hearings, which Takasugi will
consider as evidence, Levine said.
   The portly Miller, who had chronic money problems, was arrested
in 1984 and charged with passing documents to Svetlana Ogorodnikov
in exchange for sex, an overcoat and promises of $50,000 in gold
and $15,000 in cash. He was a member of the Los Angeles FBI office
counterintelligence unit at the time.
   Levine said he would argue that Miller's auditory dyslexia makes
his statements to FBI interrogators questionable.
   ``I've told the truth and I always have,'' Miller said during a
pretrial hearing. ``I did not give anybody any documents.''
   Levine also declined to call to the stand Miller's two alleged
Soviet contacts, Ms. Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nikolai
Ogorodnikov.
   The couple pleaded guilty to espionage charges. The husband has
finished his prison term, but the wife remains in prison.
   Earlier, Miller's lawyers requested deportation of Ogorodnikov
be delayed so he could be called as a witness. Levine said Friday
that he wasn't needed to testify.

<HEAD>Outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease Restricts VA Heart Transplants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease has
forced doctors to temporarily stop performing heart transplants at
one of just three veterans' hospitals that perform such surgery,
officials said Friday.
   Two heart recipients at the Salt Lake VA Medical Center have
gotten the disease, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced.
   VA spokesman Warren Longley said patients awaiting transplant
surgery at the Salt Lake VA hospital may be referred to one of two
other Utah hospitals for the operation.
   ``We want it made clear there won't be any delay should an organ
become available,'' he said.
   Longley said the patients apparently became infected after
taking drugs to prevent organ rejection. The drugs suppress the
immune system, making patients more to infection, he said.
   One of the patients, identified by family members as William
``Tink'' Badget, of Sheridan, Wyo., was listed in critical
condition following a transplant earlier this week.
   Officials withheld the name of the second patient.
   Badget's family said he was showing no signs of rejecting the
new heart but that the Lgionnaires' infection was compromising his
respiratory system.
   Legionnaires' disease got its name from a 1976 outbreak at an
American Legion convention in Philadelphia.
   The sometimes-fatal disease is caused by a common bacteria that
grows in water, including that in air-conditioning ducts.
   Longley said the second patient suffered a mild infection and
had recovered both from the illness and the transplant. He was
expected to be discharged over the weekend.
   Only two other VA hospitals perform heart transplants, in
Richmond, Va., and Chicago, Longley said.
   Longley said doctors have not yet determined where the infection
at the VA originated.

<TEXT>
   A renegade colonel who led a revolt
on the Philippines' second-largest island surrendered Saturday,
ending the seventh military rebellion crushed during President
Corazon Aquino's four-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino had refused to negotiate with the rebels and
promised to crush them.
   Col. Alexander Noble surrendered unconditionally at 3 a.m. t
Sen. Aquilino Pimentel on Mindanao island, said Pimentel and
military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa.
   Brig. Gen. Emiliano Templo, a military spokesman, said Noble's
chief civilian ally, Reuben Canoy, had also been arrested. Canoy is
leader of the Mindanao Independence Movement and joined Noble in
proclaiming self-rule for the island.
   Pimentel said he would bring Noble, 42, to Manila later Saturday
and turn him over to the military. Government troops were rounding
up Noble's followers ``group by group,'' de Villa said.
   ``The small disruption in northern Mindanao is over,'' he said.
``We have recovered the camps that they seized. We are normalizing
the conditions in these two cities.''
   There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Aquino. Officials said
she was notified shortly after Noble gave up.
   In Cagayan de Oro, 500 miles south of Manila, a grim-faced Noble
claimed his objectives of drawing attention to problems of Mindanao
had been achieved.
   ``At least the basic issues can be resolved peacefully,'' Noble
told reporters. ``It's a good pattern for everyone for national
reconciliation.''
   Noble and his forces launched their rebellion early Thursday,
seizing military camps in Butuan and Cagayan de Oro and proclaiming
independencefor Mindanao.
   De Villa said Noble's followers in Butuan, 70 miles east of
Cagayan de Oro, had surrendered. The report could not be
immediately confirmed.
   De Villa said Noble and another renegade officer, Lt. Col.
Victor Erfe, tried to slip out of Camp Evangelista, headquarters of
the 4th Infantry Division, before dawn Saturday but changed their
minds and surrendered to Pimentel.
   Local officials said Noble gave up after several hours of
negotiations.
   About 2 a.m., Noble telephoned Pimentel and said he was ready to
surrender, local reporters said. Pimentel sent a car to pick up
Noble, and Noble's troops then filed out two-by-two in civilian
clothes, witnesses said.
   In Manila, Col. Juanito Rimando said about 150 of Noble's troops
had been taken into custody as of midmorning. Officials had
estimated Noble had about 300 troops and up to 600 civilians with
him.
   De Villa said he had been contacted by the division commander,
Brig. Gen. Miguel Sol. Sol disappeared soon after the takeover and
was ``temporarily'' relieved.
   De Villa quoted Sol as saying he had ``escaped'' Noble's troops
and wanted to return to government control.
   Pimentel, a former mayor of Cagayan de Oro, flew to the city on
Friday to offer himself as a negotiator to end the crisis.
   During a radio interview, Pimentel said he would accompany Noble
to Manila later Saturday and that the colonel would be handed over
to military authorities.
   ``They want me to continue their cause for Mindanao, which is
for the national government to give enough attention,'' Pimentel
said. ``I don't see anything wrong with that.''
   Military officials here suspected that Noble's goal was not
independence for Mindanao but to create a diversion. They suspected
that Noble wanted to force the government to deploy troops from
Manila.
   Military dissidents would then strike in the capital and try to
topple the government.
   Troops were placed on full alert in Manila and garrisons in the
capital were reinforced. But there was no sign of any unusual troop
movements here.
   It appeeared that Noble gave up after realizing that his mutiny
had not led to any general uprising on Mindanao or in the Manila
area.
   Earlier Friday, about 150 elite Scout Rangers from the 23rd
Infantry Battalion in the Mindanao city of Iligan had declared
their allegiance to Noble. Local journalists said the Rangers
joined the revolt because of an air raid Thursday on their
garrison.
   Military officials said government planes fired on the camp
while attacking and destroying a rebel helicopter. Late Friday, the
mutinous rangers left their camp and marched to the heart of
Iligan, where they planned to camp overnight.
   Government forces did not attempt to stop them to avoid a
firefight in the industrial center.
   Earlier in the day, Noble offered to negotiate with the Aquino
government and met later for about 90 minutes with local clerics.
   Mrs. Aquino's administration has come under increasing criticism
for failure to provide basic services and to maintain law and
order.
   Noble was formerly chief of staff of Mrs. Aquino's guard force,
but he turned against her and joined a coup attempt last December.
   He later fled to the jungles of northern Mindanao, where he
organized a private army of Higoanon tribesmen.
   Noble said he wanted talks with the Moro National Liberation
Front, a Moslem guerrilla group that has been waging a 20-year-old
struggle for self-rule. Mindanao is the home of the 5 million
member Moslem community in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Study Finds Higher Than Expected Rate of AIDS Infection Through
Oral Sex</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new analysis of the sexual behavior of
dozens of men infected with the AIDS virus has implicated oral sex
between men as a greater risk than many scientists had assumed.
   The researchers looked at 82 men at three continuing San
Francisco Bay area studies who tested positive for HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS. Of the 82, 17 percent reported they engaged in
oral sex and no other behavior that carries a high risk of catching
AIDS.
   ``Oral sex was not implicated as a major risk factor in previous
studies,'' one of the primary researchers, Warren Winkelstein, said
Friday. ``What this study does is show pretty clearly that it is a
strong risk factor.
   ``We've always pointed out that oral sex was a potential risk.
Now, we've confirmed it,'' added Winkelstein, professor of
epidemiology at the University of California at Berkeley's School
of Public Health.
   Kent Taylor, spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease
Control, said the findings were important.
   ``We're looking for more information on the transmission by way
of oral sex because not a lot has been documented in this area,''
Taylor said. ``I would say this is a very interesting finding. This
is obviously a very difficult topic to research.''
   Epidemiologist Michael Samuel, who presented the analysis this
week at the American Public Health Association annual meeting in
New York City, said the men analyzed became infected between 1984
and 1990.
   More than half of the 82 men engaged in receptive and insertive
anal intercourse and receptive and insertive oral sex, according to
the study.
   Thirty-four percent didn't engage in anal receptive intercourse
- which is known to carry a high risk of AIDS transmission - but
did participate in at least one of the other three behaviors. And
17 percent of the infected men reported only oral intercourse,
either receptive or insertive.
   Samuel said that the infection risk also was elevated with the
use of a douche or enema before anal intercourse, countering a
belief by some that such actions might decrease a chance of HIV
infection.
   The data also confirmed findings of others studies: that ``the
risk was unmistakably higher for those with two to four partners
than for those with one partner.''
   The new findings do not address the risks of oral sex between
men and women. They also do not indicate how the AIDS virus was
transmitted during the oral sex, or to what extent condoms or any
other protective measures could have prevented infection.
   On Oct. 1, 1989, the San Francisco Health Department reported
the first two documented cases in which men became infected with
the AIDS virus through oral sex.
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Kopp had warned four years
before that oral sex might be a transmission path for the AIDS
virus. But at the time health authorities and parts of the gay
community were debating the issue.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of August 146,746 have been diagnosed with AIDS in the United
States since reporting began in 1981. As of Aug. 31, 89,761 deaths
had been recorded.

   Here is a statement of president Bush on the
temporary budget resolution passed by Congress Friday night. The
statement was read by Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The hour of reckoning is at hand. At midnight the Congress of
the United States must face up to the shutdown of government
services and resulting confusion that will be strewn across this
land because we could not produce a budget.
   It is deeply discouraging that the governing bodies of this
country would wrangle with the nation's fiscal affairs for nearly a
year and fail.
   Tonight, because there is no budget, the United States
government under existing law does not have the authority to
continue operations, and I will not be a party to the process that
would once again put off meeting its responsibilities for a few
more days.
   I will not sign the continuing resolution passed by the House
and Senate tonight, which simply delays once again the most serious
constitutional responsibilities of government, to manage the
people's money.
   At midnight tonight our national parks and monuments will close.
   Cleanup at hazardous waste sites will cease.
   Social Security offices will accept no new applications.
   Border inspections will be delayed.
   In one agency after another, thousands of federal employees
would no longer be able to serve public tasks necessary for the
public good.
   The people of America did not send their representatives to
Washington to produce these consequences.
   As I said in my inaugural address, they did not send us here to
bicker, and tonight I challenge the Congress to act as quickly as
possible to produce an acceptable budget.
   Don't wait for people to lose confidence in their government.
   Act now, tomorrow, as soon as possible to produce a budget that
reduces the deficit, avoids recession and puts our economy on the
path of sustained growth.
   I stand ready to work with the members of Congress and to
produce a responsible plan.
   After months of hard work we produced a budget agreement that
would have cut a real 500 billion dollars off out deficit over the
next five years.
   The White House and the Congressional leadership of the
Democratic and Republican parties worked hard to put together that
agree and put in place the largest deficit reduction in history.
   It's a sad commentary that the full House did not have the
courage of those convictions.
   But surely the reality of a government closedown will convince
everyone that a solution must be found.
   It is time to act responsibly on this problem and produce a
fiscal 1991 budget.

   A student leader at the University of the
District of Columbia Friday said students would end their 10-day
protest and occupation of a campus office building.
   Mark Thompson, spokesman for the protesting students, said the
Board of Trustees had agreed to msot of their demands.
   Earlier, he said students might be open to compromise on their
insistence that the 11 mayoral appointees to the university's
15-member board of trustees resign.
   ``There must be at least some personnel changes on the board if
not all - if not immediately, then soon,'' Thompson said.
   The students will now propose a bill in the City Council to
reorganize the board, he said.
   Operations at the 12,000-student school have been on hold since
as many as 500 students barricaded themselves inside a campus
building Sept. 26 and presented 44 demands, including improvements
in academic and athletic programs. Most of the demands were granted
early in the negotiations.
   Trustees and student leaders met early Friday, but gave
differing accounts of whether an agreement was close.
   Earlier in the day, trustee Alonza Evans said the board made
additional concessions to the students in an attempt to end the
standoff at the Student Affairs Building.
   Those included a public apology by trustee Richard Gross for
remarks made during negotiations that students said belittled the
school and a meeting with the city's new mayor after Election Day
to discuss university problems.
   Students said five board members had resigned by Wednesday, but
university spokesman John Britton said that number had been reduced
to three by Thursday afternoon.
   A. Knighton Stanley withdrew his resignation, and Britton said
student reports that trustee Herbert O. Reid had agreed to resign
were incorrect.
   Stanley offered his resignation again Friday, however.

   Austria is searching for a new role in
Europe with the fall of the Iron Curtain and rise of a united
Germany, but campaigning for parliamentary elections Sunday has
focused on domestic issues and mudslinging.
   Emerging populist and environmental parties could deal the worst
blow to the main Socialist and Peoples' parties since the
republic's formation in 1945.
   The Socialists, in government since 1970, have been hurt by a
series of corruption scandals. Several of their officials have
tampered with public funds, and alleged cover-ups from the past are
now in the courts. Former Socialist Chancellor Fred Sinowatz was
recently found guilty of perjury.
   The conservative Peoples' Party, which joined the Socialists in
a coalition after the last elections in 1986, has suffered because
its leadership is often perceived as weak.
   The Peoples' Party, headed by Vice-Chancellor Josef Riegler,
also still bears the burden of its support four years ago for
President Kurt Waldheim, who is accused of concealing his World War
II past. Waldheim is not a major issue in the campaign, however.
   The opposition parties stand to gain from the weakness of the
governing coalition.
   The right-leaning Freedom Party, under populist leader Joerg
Haider, has garnered considerable support in recent years, gaining
strongly in regional elections. Haider, 40, hopes to win more than
20 percent of the vote. In 1986, the Freedom Party won 9.7 percent
of the vote for 18 of the 183 seats.
   The Green-Alternative Party, holding eight seats in Parliament,
hopes to double its mandate. It has been among the most critical of
Haider, with one Green leader, Peter Pilz, calling Haider's party a
mixture of ``right-radical and populist-opportunist.''
   The Socialists now have 80 seats and the Peoples' Party 77.
   The Socialists, who in opinion polls are just ahead of the
Peoples' Party, have categorically excluded coalition with Haider,
who has relentlessly criticized the government.
   Some in the Peoples' Party have hinted at a coalition with the
Freedom Party if it draws votes away from the big parties. Riegler
himself, however, has ruled out governing with Haider.
   According to pollsters, an unusually high 25 percent of voters
were undecided or determined not to vote about two weeks before the
election.
   With the governing parties on the defensive, the campaign has
been marked by mutual accusations and name-calling.
   A Peoples' Party poster with a photo of a yawning hippopotamus
says, ``Mouthing off is not enough,'' a reference to Haider's
repeated criticism.
   Haider turned the hippopotamus to advantage at a recent rally.
   ``Where would we be if we hadn't opened our mouths in the last
four years?'' Haider asked an approving Vienna crowd.
   Besides, he said, a hippopotamus ``has the ability to become
extremely old and survive all others.''
   In a televised debate 10 days before the election, Socialist
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and conservative leader Riegler also
exchanged barbs.
   The Socialist Party campaigned heavily on the merits of
Vranitzky, a charismatic 50-year-old whose background in banking
and performance as chancellor endear him to many Austrians.
   Riegler scathingly compared the Socialists to a store vendor
saying, ``Don't look at my goods, but I have a very attractive
salesperson.''
   Vranitzky charged Riegler was unable to coordinate a clear line
on major issues.
   Haider has struck more emotional chords.
   A Freedom Party poster in the capital cries: ``Vienna must not
become Chicago,'' a reference to rising crime that many Austrians
believe is perpetrated by immigrants.
   The government last month imposed visa restrictions for Poles
and sent troops to the open border with Hungary in an attempt to
cut down on illegal immigration and black market labor.
   Haider has urged tougher measures since East Europeans have been
allowed to travel freely.
   Campaigning in Vienna, Haider earned applause when he admonished
Eastern Europeans: ``What was valid for our parents and
grandparents must also be valid in Eastern Europe. In 1945, we also
had nothing and had to work. So work hard and build it up again.''
   While other parties have preferred to chart a new European
course for Austria after the elections, Haider has demanded an end
to restrictions imposed on the country by the victorious Allies in
World War II.
   Among those restrictions are arms sales and other trade with
Germany, which under Hitler had annexed an independent Austria in
1938.

   NASA workers loaded rocket fuel on
space shuttle Discovery Friday, preparing the craft for a Saturday
morning launch of the spacecraft carrying the nuclear-powered solar
probe Ulysses.
   Pumping more than half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and
oxygen into the fuel tank was a critical test of the shuttle's
rocket plumbing system. Fuel leaks earlier caused four launch
scrubs in Discovery's sister ships, but officials said no leaks
were immediately found Friday night.
   Discovery was scheduled to lift off at 7:35 a.m. Saturday.
   ``Everything is going according to plan,'' said NASA spokesman
Dick Young.
   Earlier Friday, a judge rejected a petition by anti-nuclear
activists who wanted to prevent NASA from launching the
nuclear-powered Ulysses. The action, in a Washington federal court,
cleared the way for launch preparations to continue.
   Two demonstrators opposed to the radioactive cargo on Discovery
were arrested Friday morning at the Kennedy Space Center.
   Six hours after launch, Discovery's five-man crew was scheduled
to release Ulysses from the shuttle cargo bay. The probe is
designed to rocket itself out of Earth orbit for a roundabout
voyage that eventually will enable it to study the unexplored polar
regions of the sun.
   Young said Discovery's mission would be unaffected by any
government shutdown resulting from the federal budget dispute. He
said funds for the mission had already been set aside and notices
had gone out that all employees were to report to work.
   ``The mood of the team is confident and that's despite
distractions and disappointments recently,'' said launch director
Robert B. Sieck. ``If the weather is good to us, we'll have some
good news'' on Saturday.
   For NASA, the news has been mostly bad since the last successful
shuttle launch in April. The agency has scrubbed four shuttle
launch attempts because of hydrogen fuel leaks and learned that
there is a serious flaw in the Hubble space telescope.
   Another problem was added to the list Thursday when workers
discovered that a 9-foot, 70-pound metal beam had been left in the
engine compartment of the shuttle Atlantis.
   When the craft was hoisted from a horizontal to a vertical
position, the beam clanked around inside the compartment, causing
up to 25 dents and dings. None of the damage was believed serious,
Sieck said, and Atlantis is still scheduled for a mission in
November.
   The beam is normally used to support a work platform used when
the shuttle is being processed on the ground.
   William Lenoir, boss of NASA's spaceflight program, said the
problems are isolated incidents and not signs of the agency's
decline.
   ``I don't see a common thread that connects the Hubble incident,
the hydrogen leaks, and the beam,'' Lenoir said at a news
conference.
   A group of 20 demonstrators gathered at a restricted entrance to
the space center Friday morning and protested Ulysses' nuclear
power supply. They milled around the gate, waving signs and calling
to space center employees driving in to work.
   Two women from the group were taken into custody after they
walked past a checkpoint into a restricted area. They were charged
with trespassing.
   In Washington, D.C., a judge rejected a petition by three
activist groups that sought to block Discovery's launch with its
nuclear-powered payload. They asked for more research into the
risks of the spread of radioactive materials should Discovery
explode during launch.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch rejected the contention, just
as he did for a similar claim filed last year before the launch of
Galileo, which also was nuclear powered.
   Ulysses is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator,
or RTG, which generates electricity from the heat of 23.7 pounds of
highly radioactive plutonium. The United States has used 22 RTGs on
earlier space missions, including five moon flights.
   NASA says the plutonium is housed in a module that has been
tested to withstand any probable accident. The agency estimated
that in the worst possible accident, there is only a 1-in-44
million chance of 14.5 cancer fatalities over 50 years.
   After Ulysses is released from Discovery, a two-stage rocket
will fire and send the European-built craft streaking toward
Jupiter. Ulysses will loop over Jupiter's north pole in 1992 and
the giant planet's intense gravity will give it a powerful burst of
speed and hurl it back toward the sun's south pole.
   In 1994, Ulysses will pass within 120 million miles of the sun's
south pole and about 18 months later it will pass over the solar
north pole.
   Discovery's commander is Richard N. Richards. The pilot will be
Robert D. Cabana. Others in the crew are William M. Shepherd, Bruce
Melnick, and Thomas D. Akers.

   A dozen more crimes would be subject to the
federal death penalty and executions would be carried out more
quickly, under amendments approved by law and order-minded House
members.
   ``I hope we never bring up another crime bill a month before an
election,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., said Thursday as the House
bowed to conservative demands for a major reshaping of the measure.
   Hughes said campaign considerations were overshadowing the
debate, but critics of the bill said stern measures were needed to
curb mounting crime.
   Sarcastic cries of ``kill, kill, kill'' wafted through the House
as lawmakers added harsh provisions that Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.,
said were being demanded ``by the cop on the beat and the man on
the street.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A fundraiser hosted by savings and loan
operator Charles H. Keating Jr. plays a major role in a
recommendation that an ethics investigation proceed against Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., say sources familiar with the inquiry.
   Just weeks after the March 23, 1987, fundraiser for Riegle, the
Michigan Democrat and four Senate colleagues met with U.S. banking
regulators on behalf of Keating - a political donor to all five.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is trying to establish whether any
of the five senators were influenced to help Keating by the $1.3
million he and assocites donated to the lawmakers' campaigns and
causes.
   Congressional sources previously confirmed that special counsel
Robert S. Bennett had recommended that the investigation continue
against Riegle and Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Bennett also proposed that Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and John
Glenn, D-Ohio, be dropped from the investigation.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) - The small central African nation of
Rwanda faced a population and ecological crisis even before it was
invaded this week by armed refugees from neighboring Uganda.
   An exodus of Asian businessmen from their adopted country was an
ominous sign of deteriorating conditions, including overpopulation,
soil erosion and AIDS.
   Western experts say more than 50 families of mainly Indian and
Pakistani origin have left Rwanda in recent months in search of
fresh opportunities in neighboring Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire -
countries also suffering from poverty, disease and violence.
   Reflecting the trend, the black market price for U.S. dollars,
preferably in $100 bills favored for smuggling, shot up to more
than double the bank exchange rate of 68 Rwanda francs per dollar.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - NASA, embarrassed by more shuttle
trouble, counted down to Saturday's launch of Discovery while
trying to figure out how a 9-foot-long, bright yellow beam was left
to bang around inside Atlantis.
   In Washington, meanwhile, a federal judge was expected to rule
today whether Discovery's launch with a nuclear-powered sun probe
will be allowed to proceed.
   The 70-pound metal beam crashed around Atlantis' engine
compartment as the orbiter was being hoisted into an upright
position in the assembly building. Some insulation covering
interior components and plumbing was dented, said Forrest
McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center.
   The beam was left by an experienced crew and paperwork indicated
that everything had been removed, he said.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Louisiana's U.S. Senate race has become a
head-to-head match between an incumbent Democrat reluctantly
supported by Republican party leaders over a Republican who was
once a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
   State Sen. Ben Bagert dropped out of the primary race Thursday,
saying he feared his Republican candidacy could force incumbent
Democrat J. Bennett Johnston into a runoff with ex-Klansman and
Republican state Rep. David Duke. Under Louisiana's open primary
system, all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party
affiliation. A runoff between the top two finishers is held if no
one receives a majority of votes.
   Bagert said his polls indicated he might pull just enough votes
to keep Johnston from getting more than 50 percent of the vote and
force the three-term incumbent into a runoff with Duke.
   GOP leaders say such an event would embarrass the state and the
Republican party nationally. Eight Republican senators endorsed
Johnston earlier this week.

   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Neighborhood beautifiers who say
driveway basketball hoops are eyesores want to slam dunk them all.
Opponents eager to bench the plan say it's un-American.
   ``What's the point of having the pristine appearance in Garden
City if it's not for our children to enjoy,'' Donna Robins, the
mother of three ball-playing boys, said at a village trustees
meeting Thursday night.
   Others in town - including New York Knicks Hall of Famer Dave
DeBusschere and ex-New York Nets guard Bill Melchionne - are
mounting a fast break to overturn the town's policy.
   The flap actually began two years ago, when the affluent Long
Island town included basketball hoops under a 1924 law banning
``accssory structures.''

   A renegade colonel who led a revolt
on the Philippines' second-largest island surrendered after trying
to leave the military garrison he seized two days earlier, the
military chief said Saturday.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said Col. Alexander Noble
surrendered unconditionally at 3 a.m. to Sen. Aquilino Pimentel,
after he and a companion tried unsuccessfully to slip out of Camp
Evangelista in Cagayan de Oro, 500 miles south of here.
   De Villa said government troops were rounding up Noble's
followers ``group by group'' and that the situation in Cagayan de
Oro had returned to normal.
   De Villa also said Noble's followers in Butuan, 70 miles east of
Cagayan de Oro, had surrendered.
   The report could not be immediately confirmed.
   Noble and his forces launched their rebellion early Thursday,
seizing military camps in Butuan and Cagayan de Oro and proclaiming
independence for Mindanao, the country's second largest island.

<HEAD>IN THE SPIRIT OF HITCHCOCK: Yuppie Mayhem and Icebox Logic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Schlesinger lately has been thinking a lot
about Alfred Hitchcock.
   Actually, he hasn't had much choice. Schlesinger's latest film,
``Pacific Heights,'' is a psychological thriller with irresistible
connections to the master of suspense himself. Questions are bound
to arise.
   Based on a true story, ``Pacific Heights'' stars Melanie
Griffith and Matthew Modine as a young couple who purchase a large
Victorian house in San Francisco and plan to rent rooms on the
ground floor.
   But they are nearly ruined when smooth-talking Carter Hayes
(Michael Keaton) occupies one apartment and refuses to pay,
manipulating the legal system so Griffith and Modine end up on the
wrong side of the law.
   Hitchcock would have loved it. He specialized in making a little
mayhem with ``ordinary'' lives, turning an advertising executive
into a fugitive in ``North by Northwest'' and placing a dead body
in a small New England town in ``The Trouble With Harry.''
   There's more. Schlesinger gave a minor role to Tippi Hedren,
Griffith's mother and the star of two Hitchcock films, ``The
Birds'' and ``Marnie.'' He also makes a most Hitchcock-like cameo;
Schlesinger's the heavy-set man with a white beard riding the
elevator with Griffith. (In Hitchcock's ``Spellbound,'' the
director is seen leaving an elevator at the same time as Gregory
Peck.)
   Your defense, Mr. Schlesinger?
   ``I haven't made a study of his films in order to ape him,''
said the director, who has made some pretty fair movies himself,
including ``Darling,'' ``Sunday, Bloody Sunday'' and the Academy
Award-winning ``Midnight Cowboy.''
   ``But what Hitchcock used to do quite often was take normal
life, yuppie life, and from normalcy have something gradually creep
up on you. And as a child I saw `The Lady Vanishes,' that wonderful
film with Dame May Whitty, and was haunted by the image of a
bandaged head.
   ``As far as the appearance, I used to appear in all my films,
and then I said, `This is ridiculous, Hitchcock did this all the
time,' so I stopped.''
   Schlesinger fans will spot some of the director's own touches in
``Pacific Heights,'' a sense of understatement, an insistence that
all ends remain loose, and an ever-observant camera that cases a
room, item by item, like an electronic house detective.
   ``I like the idea of using a camera to tell the story about
people,'' he said. ``My doctor in London, you can barely go sit in
his consulting room because it's filled with frogs, little funny
things hanging from the ceiling. There's a scene in a lawyer's
office. I thought why not make the lawyer collect frogs and
introduce her with that image.''
   Schlesinger, born in London in 1926, was a character actor for
stage, film and televison and also made documentaries; ``Terminus''
won the Golden Lion for best documentary at the 1961 Venice Film
Festival.
   The following year he established himself as one of England's
finest young directors with ``A Kind of Loving'' and then made
``Billy Liar'' and ``Darling,'' for which Julie Christie won an
Academy Award for best actress in 1965. He also managed to top
Hitchcock, who never won an Oscar, by receiving one in 1969 for
``Midnight Cowboy.''
   His theory of directing: Life is double-edged and movies should
be, too. No Schlesinger film ends with a couple walking
hand-in-hand into the sunset (if it did, he'd probably make them
escaped convicts) or a guy with flowers arriving on top of a car,
as in a certain popular romantic comedy.
   ``When I first heard about `Pretty Woman' I said, `Ugh.' But
it's a very well-confected film. . . . I had a good time.
   ``If I've ever had any commercial success, it's been a total
fluke. I wouldn't have known `Midnight Cowboy' would have done so
well.''
   Schlesinger doesn't condemn ``Pretty Woman'' because he's also
been guilty of relegating reality to a supporting role. In
``Marathon Man,'' a 1976 thriller with Laurence Olivier and Dustin
Hoffman, a vicious Nazi (Olivier) risks going to the Jewish quarter
in New York in search of diamonds.
   Great action, Schlesinger notes, but unnecessary - he didn't
have to go to the Jewish quarter to find about the diamonds.
   And in the middle of ``Pacific Heights,'' Modine overhears
Keaton discussing his con game and has the incriminating evidence
he's been hoping for. But Modine doesn't act on it, and fails to
tell police or his lawyer.
   ``It would have ended the film,'' laughed Schlesinger, who in
his defense again summoned the spirit of poor Mr. Hitchcock.
   ``There's an expression applied to Hitchcock's films called
`icebox logic.' Icebox logic is as long as the film plays for the
audience as they're seeing it, it doesn't matter if they go home
and later, when they open the fridge to get out the milk,' say to
themselves, `Now wait a moment, why did they do this?' ''

<HEAD>Molestation Case Becomes TV Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You wouldn't be wrong if you thought today's
tragedy is tomorrow's TV movie. Producers commonly scour
newspapers, magazines and TV news shows, seeking fare for
``fact-based'' flicks.
   Whatever happened to what you might call ``fiction-based'' TV
movies?
   They exist, but viewers are more interested in the other kind,
says producer Steve Tisch, who has made both:
   ``And selfishly, networks are more interested in true stories.
It's almost a joke, but if they can say `Based on a true story,'
they feel it gives them three or four (more) ratings points.''
   Tisch should know. He co-produced ``The Burning Bed,'' a 1984
NBC movie based on the true story involving wife-beating. The
fourth highest-rated TV movie in history, it got a 52 percent share
of the audience.
   Now he has ``Judgment,'' another true-story dramatization.
Premiering Saturday on cable's Home Box Office, it's written and
directed by Tom Topor, a former New York reporter and author of the
Broadway drama ``Nuts.''
   ``Judgment'' is about a Louisiana couple whose son was among a
number of young boys sexually molested by their parish priest.
   (The real priest pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts and was
sentenced to 20 years in prison).
   Played by Keith Carradine and Blythe Danner, the couple, devout
Catholics, refused the Catholic Church's offer of a secret
financial settlement that the other parents were willing to accept.
   In the film, the couple also wants the priest sent to prison.
The local district attorney balks, explaining that a conviction is
unlikely. But he refers them to an old friend, a veteran trial
lawyer played by Jack Warden.
   They sue the church, accusing it of concealing information about
the priest's past history of child molestation.
   As their attorney explains things, he wins the civil case and
then, ``I take the transcript of the trial to the D.A. He goes to
trial, he wins.''
   While ``fact-based'' films may get the ratings, they sometimes
can backfire for a network, if only in terms of the network's
image.
   Case in point: ``Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston,'' a
CBS movie that aired last month. The movie dramatized a
headline-making tragedy last year in which a pregnant woman, Carol
Stuart, was shot dead. Her husband, Charles, later apparently
committed suicide.
   The dead woman's family sharply criticized CBS, saying the film
set a ``dangerous precedent'' that could sacrifice the privacy of
other grieving families for the sake of profits.
   Such criticism is unlikely to happen with ``Judgment,'' for
several reasons.
   Tisch's previous TV films generally have drawn praise for their
taste and responsibility, and, he said, the couple depicted in
``Judgment'' wanted their story told and ``enthusiastically allowed
us to make the movie.''
   Their one restriction: Their real names weren't to be used.
   Unlike the families in the CBS movie, the Louisiana couple also
was paid for rights to their story, although Tisch said they had no
say in how the story was told. He declined to say how much they
were paid.
   With ``fact-based'' TV movies so rampant, Hollywood's producers
may seem like the new version of ambulance chasers, rushing minions
to the scenes of nationally publicized crimes and tragedies to snap
up the movie rights even before the victims' tears dry.
   But Tisch didn't go after the story of the Louisiana couple. It
was brought to him, he said, by a CBS News producer, Rob Hershman.
The TV journalist had first done the story as a segment on CBS'
fast-paced, now-defunct ``West 57th'' series.
   Hershman, who still works for CBS News, is getting a
co-producer's credit on ``Judgment.''
   Tisch's other efforts range from the successful Tom Cruise
sleeper hit of 1983, ``Risky Business,'' to ABC's acclaimed but
short-lived series ``Call to Glory'' to last year's CBS bomb,
``Dirty Dancing.''
   Television movies have occupied a large part of his career, but
more are based on fiction than fact, said Tisch, a nephew of CBS
president Laurence A. Tisch.
   ``I would say that of the 14 or so television movies I'd done,
maybe four or five have been based on true stories,'' he said.
   ``Yes, they get ratings. Yes, people are interested in watching
true stories. But I've always taken the position that I'm going to
be morally responsible, and in my movies educate as well as
entertain.''

   Muzi is a Zulu in alien
territory, a migrant in a settled township, and needs no time to
think when asked what he hates most about living in a workers'
hostel.
   ``Everything is bad,'' he said. ``There's no privacy, even in
the toilets. Nothing's being done.''
   He sat on one of four beds in a dark concrete-block room beneath
a roof of corrugated metal, a stocky, bearded man with his arms
wrapped across his chest. Grease and dirt stained the floor and
walls. A lone electric wire stretched overhead.
   ``Staying here, you end up drinking,'' Muzi said. ``I'm so tired
of waiting.''
   The squalid hostels, long a source of many social ills, have
become flash points of political violence that has killed nearly
800 blacks in townships around Johannesburg since Aug. 12.
   Many of the vicious street clashes have pitted hostel dwellers,
usually Zulus like Muzi, against township residents from other
tribes.
   Most of the Zulus support the conservative Inkatha movement
based in their homeland in Natal province, and many township
residents support the African National Congress.
   Even South Africa's white government, architect of the apartheid
system that spawned the hostels, has called for change. President
F.W. de Klerk visited a Soweto hostel in September and, standing in
a urine-stained hall, said the conditions were unacceptable.
   Officials have suggested converting some hostels to family
dwellings, but no action has been taken.
   More than 130 hostels housing nearly 200,000 people dot the 31
black townships around Johannesburg.
   Muzi, who is 32 and has two children, is one of countless blacks
who for decades have left their families in impoverished rural
areas to seek work in Johannesburg, the financial hub of South
Africa. He would not reveal his last name.
   Apartheid laws made the move difficult, requiring a migrant to
obtain a job first in order to live in an urban township. Most
restrictions were repealed in the 1980s, but overcrowding in the
townships has left migrant workers little choice but to live in the
cramped, single-sex dormitories without heat or indoor plumbing.
   Miserable living conditions combined with tribal and political
rivalries encourage fighting.
   ``The evil migrant labor system . . . lies at the root of the
current conflict,'' said a group of national church leaders,
including Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop who won the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize.
   Other observers say it's more complicated.
   John Kane-Berman, head of the respected Institute of Race
Relations, a private organization, said personal disputes,
political and tribal differences, human nature and poor living
conditions contribute to the violence.
   ``It's a lot of different factors, and one might not be aware of
them,'' he said.
   For example, rooms in many hostels are segregated by tribe. If a
man has a fight with someone from another room and his friends get
involved, he said, a personal dispute has the appearance of tribal
fighting.
   He insisted that tribal differences play a role, despite
statements to the contrary by black leaders.
   ``It's not fashionable in liberal circles to talk about black
ethnic rivalry because the government used that argument as part of
its divisive strategy,'' he said.
   Kane-Berman said township residents look down on the poorly
educated rural workers, creating class differences, and the
frustration and danger of hostel life compound the problems.
   More than 5,000 people live in some hostels, like Jabulani and
Merafe in Soweto. Residents pay monthly rent of about $6 for a bed
in a room that usually is shared by with at least three others.
   Many turn to prostitutes, alcohol and drugs while away from
their families.
   ``The compounds are a social disaster, not only in terms of
separating breadwinners from families, but in terms of the
psychological strains placed on the workers in them,'' Jerry
Majatladi, spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers, told
the Star newspaper.

<HEAD>The Bottom Line Discipline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An immense difference exists between the
techniques and procedures for cutting expenses in private industry
and cutting them in government.
   The products and services are different, of course, and the
method of doing business is, too. While the private sector is
profit-seeking the government is a not-for-profit organization, and
it almost always achieves that goal.
   But there is an even vaster difference, one that involves the
recognition of reality. Governent budget cutters tend to shirk from
the task, even to evade or fudge the issues. Should a business do
that it would go bankrupt.
   Businesses have indeed gone under after futile attempts to hide
from the realities. In the end, the bottom line always catches up
to them. The banks shut them off. Creditors bring them to court and
mete out the remains.
   Governments aren't like that; they persist. Some Third World
nations owe more money than they can count, and the same might even
be said about the U.S. government. Some budget ``agreement''
numbers had a strange appearance.
   The budget cut package assumed, for example, that long-term
interest rates might fall to 5.3 percent, a level unseen since
1967, and that short-term rates might decline to 4.2 percent, which
would be a post-1972 record low.
   Questionable assumptions also were made about economic growth,
that the rate would nearly double over the next year and exceed
even that pace in 1991 and 1992. Considering taxes would be higher,
that scenario was suspect.
   Some of the devices used in cutting government budgets could
never exist in the private sector, such as tossing certain expenses
off the books, throwing them ``off budget.'' Business could never
get away with writing off a creditor.
   Neither could the management of a business ever convince
shareholders and directors that it was really cutting to the bone
when it was merely cutting the rate of previous spending
projections. The budget summitteers did that.
   Businesses all over the country are cutting these days. Some are
doing so because they fear a recession is under way and might get
worse, and others, such as Chase Manhattan Bank, are cutting simply
to exist. The choices for private-sector firms are painful but
unavoidable; they must close plants and lay off workers.
   Some companies, in fact, are choosing to shrink themselves on a
more permanent basis. They are abandoning product lines and selling
off divisions, retreating to their basic core of expertise - back
to their original self.
   Government could never do this. Its customers simply would never
let it happen. Should it make the attempt, its elected officials
and directors would lose their jobs as quickly as voters could make
their way to the polls.
   In short, the marketplace makes business relatively honest. The
bottom line is an impartial disciplinarian, one that doesn't
forgive and seldom tolerates excuses. While it has been known to
miss some crooks and charlatans, usually it steps right in and
slaps down fuzzy thinkers and financial tinkerers.
   Yes, it can be bent through creative accounting and tax
loopholes, but compared to political accounting it is inflexible.
It is where the buck stops, and that seems not to be the way of
politics.
   A public-sector official, therefore, might find anything like a
bottom line an intolerable intrusion, a dangerous presence, an
infringement on style to be enacted out of existence.

   Francia Martinez stood
in line for rice, beans and flour. She wanted sugar, too, but knew
there would be none of that sweet staple.
   Sugar, the foundation of this Caribbean nation's economy for 400
years, is gone from store shelves. It is being shipped to foreign
buyers, who pay more than Dominicans can afford.
   ``Nobody understands what's going on in this country,'' said
Freddy Sanchez, waiting in a nearby gas station line that was four
blocks long. ``Prices go up, but we're still short.''
   Mrs. Martinez, taking shelter from the midday sun under a black
umbrella, said she was ``lacking everything at home'' for her
husband and three children.
   Rising consumer prices and shortages of gasoline, food,
electricity - even water - are causing hardships and widespread
protest among the Dominican Republic's 7 million people.
   Two nationwide protest strikes since August have led to violence
between security forces and demonstrators in which at least 14
people have been killed and 90 wounded. Police report 2,300
arrests, but strike leaders say the number is higher.
   A few days before a strike in September, three Santo Domingo
university students were killed by the explosion of a bomb they
were making on campus. Police found an arsenal of explosives in
Santiago, the second-largest city.
   Protest began when President Joaquin Balaguer imposed economic
austerity shortly before beginning his second consecutive four-year
term in August.
   He ended subsidies for such basic goods as flour, cooking oil
and gasoline, causing prices to triple in some cases. Gasoline has
risen since August from 55 cents a gallon to $1.42, with added help
from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Balaguer's government could not afford the normal level of oil
imports after the Persian Gulf crisis drove world prices up, so it
began importing about one-third less and rationed gasoline.
   ``There's no flour, sugar, gas, medicine because the country has
no dollars, no foreign currency, no reserves,'' said Andres
Dauhakre, a leading economist. ``Certainly the crisis in the Middle
East doesn't help.''
   Economic problems have mounted since world sugar prices
collapsed and U.S. import quotas were cut in the 1980s. Last year's
crop was smaller than usual.
   The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, has a foreign debt of $4.1 billion. By conservative
estimates 28 percent of its workers are jobless and annual
inflation is 70 percent.
   A $500 million building spree largely tied to the 500th
anniversary in 1992 of Columbus' discovery of America has created
schools, roads, housing, irrigation dams and monuments, but the
government has financed it by the inflationary means of printing
money.
   Power plants have deteriorated from neglect, causing blackouts
of up to 18 hours a day. Many homes and factories have their
generators, but fuel shortages make them unreliable. Breakdowns of
electric pumps cause water shortages.
   The International Monetary Fund demanded the austerity measures.
Balaguer, 84 and blind from glaucoma, says they are necessary and
has urged Dominicans to conserve.
   ``We have to use less gas, go out less, go to the beach less,''
he said recently. ``We must appeal to Dominican patriotism so that
we can overcome this crisis.''
   There is no current agreement with the IMF. Because the country
could not pay interest on most of its debt in the past year, it is
ineligible for loans and has no credit.
   Talks with the IMF are under way, but Dominicans are wary. The
last IMF program in 1984 led to higher prices and riots that took
100 lives.
   Tourism, the really bright prospect, is expected to net $1
billion this year, but visitors may start choosing islands with
fewer problems.
   Officials blame the unrest on supporters of leftist former
President Juan Bosch, 81, whom Balaguer defeated by 1 percent of
te vote in May.
   Jose Luis Arteaga, Balaguer's economic adviser, said: ``The
opposition thinks the Balaguer government is illegitimate because
of the elections. They want to make life impossible for us.''
   Bosch accused Balaguer, his longtime political foe, of
widespread vote fraud, but an independent electoral board said a
lengthy review of voting tallies produced no evidence.
   Balaguer's narrow victory deprived his conservative Social
Christian Reformist Party of a congressional majority and critics
accuse him of ruling by decree.
   To soften the the austerity measures, the government gave public
employees a 30 percent pay raise and froze some prices. The freezes
have led to speculative buying, creating further shortages.
   Unions demand a 150 percent general raise. The minimum wage now
is equivalent to $72 a month.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The women's rights organization Khalida
Massaoudi leads is the largest in this Moslem nation - 400 members
in a total population of 26 million.
   Ms. Massaoudi, 32, worries that the shift to democracy will do
nothing to end tyranny for Algerian women. Her fears deepen with
each political advance by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front, known as the FIS.
   ``The biggest danger for us is if the FIS take power,'' said the
soft-spoken teacher of high school mathematics. ``It will prolong
the totalitarianism Algeria has already known too long.''
   She said the Marxist revolutionaries who ruled Algeria
unchallenged for 28 years had given the fundamentalists a
ready-made framework for oppressing women under Islamic law.
   The National Liberation Front, or FLN, imposed one-party rule on
Algeria after winning independence from France in 1962. Many FLN
leaders were devout Moslems despite their Marxist phisosophy, and
wrote into the constitution that Algeria would be an Islamic
nation.
   Ms. Massaoudi said each member of her Independent Association
for the Triumph of Women's Rights is a heroine in a society ``that
has never made a gift to women.''
   ``For the crushing majority of women in this country, the only
world is the family,'' she said.
   Although barely 5 feet tall, Ms. Massaoudi stands out in her
working-class neighborhood. She holds a job, lives alone, leaves
her red hair uncovered and asks no man's permission to go out.
Algeria's work force of 8 million includes only 380,000 women.
   Most of the rights leader's female neighbors cover themselves
with long robes and scarves before leaving their houses, and nearly
always are accompanied by another woman or a male relative.
   Women served in the National Liberation Front during the
eight-year guerrilla war and Islamic tradition coexisted uneasily
with Western concepts of women's rights during the first generation
of independence.
   Women in Algiers and Oran wore skirts and trousers, but most
rural women concealed themselves behind veils.
   Divided as it was between devout Moslems from rural areas and
more secular leaders from the cities, the FLN sidestepped the issue
of women's rights.
   Then, in 1984, the National Assembly passed the Family Law in
response to pressure from Islamic fundamentalists. It was reformist
in theory, restricting polygamy, giving women a say in educating
their sons after age 10 and allowing women to initiate divorce
proceedings.
   In practice, according to Ms. Massaoudi, law codified
second-class status for women.
   One of its victims was a woman who would identify herself only
as Keltoum.
   Her husband declared them divorced in January and threw Keltoum,
31, and their five children out of the house.
   He didn't need a court ruling. Under Islamic tradition
guaranteed by the Family Law, Keltoum's husband divorced her simply
by telling her the marriage was over.
   Had Keltoum sought a divorce, she would have had to prove in
court that he had committed adultery or had not wanted children.
   ``I can't imagine saying such things before a judge,'' she said.
``No Algerian woman could.''
   An electoral code passed in 1986 allows husbands to cast their
wives' votes, which contributed to the sweeping municipal and
regional election victory by fundamentalists in June.
   ``That law was the final stab in the back by the FLN,'' Ms.
Massaoudi said. ``The FLN dug the grave for women and put them in
it.''
   The FLN has a women's wing, as do other parties, but they remain
under the control of male hierarchies.
   President Chadli Bendjedid has proposed reforming the election
law, but the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front accuses him of
bending the rules to help the FLN.
   With solid support among Algeria's swollen ranks of unemployed
young men, the fundamentalists have the strongest party as the
spring parliamentary elections approach.
   Most followers of the fundamentalist party favor separate
education for males and females.
   ``The woman is sacred,'' said Dilinjer Boualem, 55. ``We want
them to learn, to do medicine, as the (Islamic) law says. But
mixing, this we are against. It is forbidden for Moslem people.''
   On rights to work, they are more vague. An article in the
Salvation Front's newspapr said women should work ``when necessity
arises.''
   ``The woman who goes to work and preserves her honor, modesty
and purity, who honorably fulfills her task, then comes home as
clean as she left . . . should not, in our humble opinion, be
considered as having disobeyed the commandments of God,'' it said.
   One test of modesty is whether a woman wears the hijab, a scarf
covering the head and neck. Increasing numbers of women, even in
Algiers, are doing so because of religious conviction, social
pressure or reasons of fashion.
   Others refuse, even those who will not speak to a Western
journalist without permission from a male relative.
   Rhodia Belkacem, a 21-year-old secretary who binds her long
black hair with gold combs, said: ``I could never go out in a
hijab. Nobody's threatened me, but I'll never wear it, even if they
kill me.''

<HEAD>Bear Market Offspring: Tax Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news isn't all bad for stock-market
investors these days.
   Just consider the bumper crop of potential capital-loss tax
writeoffs the market decline of 1990 has produced.
   As a note of cheery reassurance, that may have a hollow ring.
But a good many stock traders will be thinking along precisely
those lines through the remainder of the year, seeking a chance to
shift some of the burden of their ill fortune onto the shoulders of
Uncle Sam.
   The basic rule they follow is that losses on financial
investments - not just stocks, but also other securities like bonds
and mutual-fund shares - can be deducted within limits against
income when you fill out your tax return.
   First, a loss realized on a security sold during the year is
used dollar for dollar to offset any capital gain you might have
realized, such as on the sale of a stock.
   If you have losses that exceed your investment gains, they can
normally be deducted against your other income up to a limit of
$3,000. Net losses of more than $3,000 can be carried forward
indefinitely to future years.
   Hence the annual exercise known on Wall Street as ``tax
selling,'' in which investors juggle their portfolios to minimize
the amounts they will owe the government.
   A generation ago, tax selling often was cited as a primary force
behind the market's fluctuations in the closing weeks of a year. In
recent years it has drawn less attention.
   That is partly due, analysts say, to the increasing dominance in
the marketplace of investing institutions, such as pension funds,
that are exempt from current taxation.
   In addition, there have been relatively few losses for investors
to consider taking in most years of late, thanks to the mighty bull
market of the 1980s. Even in 1987, when the market crashed in
October, stocks wound up the year about where they started.
   Not so in 1990. Through the first three quarters of the year the
Dow Jones industrial average was down about 11 percent, and some
broader market measures showed losses twice that size.
   Thus many observers believe tax selling could put some extra
pressure between now and mid- to late December on stocks such as
the depressed bank issues and small ``growth'' companies that have
been particularly poor performers to date.
   In their dealings with individual investors who are considering
selling a losing investment to get the tax benefits, brokers
generally advise them to act early and avoid the December rush.
   What if an investor wants to take a tax loss, but also wishes to
keep his or her position in a stock, expecting better times ahead?
   To avoid a ``wash sale'' that invalidates any tax loss, you
cannot sell the stock and buy it back within any 30-day period.
   Of course, selling in, say, mid-November and buying a stock back
31 days later exposes you to the risk of missing a sudden rally in
the interim.
   An alternative strategy is to ``double up,'' buying an
additional lot of the security first and selling the old investment
at least 31 days later.
   ``Although this will enable you to maintain your original
investment position, it will also double your risk for at least 31
days,'' points out the Consumer Reports annual Guide to Income Tax
Preparation.
   ``Your decision should be based primarily on whether you want to
own the stock, not on some perceived tax benefit that increases
your risk. Otherwise, if the stock continues to drop, you have
simply increased your loss.''

<HEAD>Many Feel Budget Compromise Squeezed Farmers Too Much</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to update with budget rejection by House</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says he
would oppose any attempt to increase his department's share of
budget cuts, but farm leaders say that isn't enough.
   They are predicting that the $13 billion in cuts included in the
deficit-reduction package rejected by the House last Thursday would
send the farm economy into a tailspin.
   It was not immediately clear if any new budget agreement would
make further cuts in the USDA budget.
   All of the $13 billion would have come out of Commodity Credit
Corp. operations.
   The CCC is synonymous with commodity price supports - the arcane
and expensive world of acreage reduction, loan rates, target prices
and deficiency payments.
   Plainly, the budget plan would have cut federal subsidies to
farmers, a major portion of annual income over many years.
   Although declining from a peak of $16.7 billion in 1987, those
direct payments are expected to be around $9 billion this calendar
year.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation sounded a complaint common
among agriculture leaders. Farm programs, it said, account for less
than 1 percent of the federal budget, yet the agreement requires
those to absorb 10 percent of the total federal reduction.
   Dean Kleckner, federation president, also cited tax increases
that he said would hurt agriculture.
   ``The proposed tax increases threaten to harm an already shaky
economy,'' he said. ``That in itself is bad for agriculture, but
the provisions affecting agriculture make matters worse.''
   Among the proposed tax hikes was an increase of 12 cents per
gallon on fuels, which Kleckner said would hurt rural people
because they drive greater distances for services and have no
public transportation alternatives.
   David Senter of the American Agriculture Movement said, ``In
effect, farmers are going to lose a major part of their income due
to this budget agreement.''
   Other factors add to the impact of budget cutting on farmers,
said Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union. Grain
prices are depressed and operating costs are rising because of the
Mideast crisis and soaring prices of crude oil.
   The $13 billion slash in USDA programs would ``throw the farm
sector into a tailspin'' financially, he said.
   Even Yeutter, who endorsed the package adopted by budget
negotiators, recognized that the cuts would ``squeeze agriculture
hard'' and that there would have to be a lot of belt-tightening.
   Yeutter said the House defeat of the plan on Thursday night made
USDA programs ``even more vulnerable to cuts than before.'' He said
the House vote was a ``betrayal of political responsibility'' to do
something about the deficit.
   ``I will strongly resist any efforts to cut agricultural
expenditures further in any future budget agreements,'' he said.
   An irony in all this is the general improvement in the financial
health of U.S. agriculture in the last few years.
   Yeutter, in a Sept. 24 letter to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said the expiring
1985 farm law helped the farm sector rebound from the doldrums of
the early 1980s.
   Farm equity, or net worth, bottomed out at $552 billion in 1986,
he said. It's now estimated at $688 billion, which he called a
``truly spectacular'' improvement of $136 billion in four years.
   Yeutter said farm debt, which peaked at $193 billion in 1982,
has been clipped to $127 billion in eight years.
   ``That puts American agriculture in a much better position to
deal with the economic shocks of the coming decade, including the
ones we've felt in recent weeks,'' he said.
   The purpose of Yeutter's letter to Leahy was to note the
challenges ahead and urge the chairman ``to design farm legislation
accordingly'' as Senate and House conferees work out compromises
for the 1990 farm bill.
   Meanwhile, USDA economists are trying to decipher what may
happen to farm income in 1991 after being at record or near-record
levels since 1985.
   One measure favored by the economists is net cash income, the
amount left over after paying cash expenses during a calendar year.
In 1990, says the department's Economic Research Service, this
could be a record, in the range of $59 billion to $63 billion.
   But 1990 farm income will not bear the brunt of the recent jump
in energy costs prompted by the Mideast crisis. Not only gasoline
and diesel, but petroleum-based fertilizers and other agricultural
chemicals will be hit.
   Couple those effects with whatever Congress decides about
cutting farm subsidies, and 1991 - and probably the presidential
election year of 1992 - will shape up as extremely tricky for
economists peering into crystal balls.
   A major upturn in exports could go a long way to ease the
financial crunch on farmers, pushing up market prices and creating
demands for greater production.
   But if that happens, it won't be quick. At the moment, USDA
forecasters are still working on 1991 export projections.
   A hint of what may happen was included in the October issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine, however. It said that both the value
and the volume of U.S. commodity exports are expected to decline.

   Trans World Airlines will lay off between 450
and 500 employees nationwide Friday because of high fuel prices, an
airline official said Thursday.
   Spokesman Donald Morrison said the layoffs would be among lower
and middle-management and clerical workers and would not disrupt
service. He said furlough notices would be sent out Friday.
   More layoffs, and possibly flight reductions, could come later,
he said. TWA, whose hub is St. Louis, has 33,000 employees. The
cuts are expected to affect about 100 workers in St. Louis.
   Bill Hoar, chief vice president, told KSDK-TV in St. Louis that
the layoffs were due to ``exorbitant'' fuel prices, not TWA's
financial status, which he called solid.
   TWA, headquartered in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., lost $300 million last
year and had to pay $366 million in interest expense on debts of
$2.5 billion.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn has been trying to reduce operating
costs for the airline and has tried to get concessions from the
pilots before he'll modernize TWA's fleet, one of the oldest in the
industry.

   President Bush and congressional leaders
pressed reluctant lawmakers to support the $500-billion
deficit-cutting plan, as Congress neared its first votes on the
election-year package of tax boosts and spending cuts.
   White House and congressional vote-counters Thursday sought
majorities from both parties but acknowledged they were shy of
their goal - especially among House Republicans.
   The first votes would be on an outline of the five-year plan
that Bush and congressional leaders completed last weekend after
four months of bargaining. Votes on specific spending cuts and tax
increases were planned in two weeks.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Lincoln Savings and Loan Association
owner Charles H. Keating Jr. asserted his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination in a reply to administrative charges
filed by federal regulators.
   According to documents released Thursday, Keating also asked the
Office of Thrift Supervision to postpone any hearing until after he
resolves separate criminal charges in Los Angeles.
   Keating has been jailed in Los Angeles since Sept. 18 in lieu of
$5 million bail in the 42-count criminal case, and his lawyers said
he had neither the time nor freedom-of-travel necessary to prepare
a defense to the agency's action.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department subpoenaed records of
major U.S. oil companies to further its investigation of steep
gasoline prices increases.
   The department announced Thursday it had sought records from a
large number of oil companies, independent refiners and marketers.
In August, government lawyers began interviewing petroleum industry
executives to seek explanations for the steep rise in gasoline
prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.

   DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. gave the United Auto Workers union
a comprehensive proposal for a new national labor contract that,
according to one company official, mirrors the contract reached
with General Motors Corp.
   The union, which ratified a three-year agreement with GM late
last month, has insisted that the UAW-GM agreement serve as a model

presented Thursday.
   Except for one provision on overtime pay, Ford isn't expected to

Japan, announced a new trade plan that could bring lower prices to
consumers.
   The proposal Thursday for a new five-year agreement to succeed
the 1986 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement, set to expire
next July 31, marks the first time chipmakers and computer makers
have joined to achieve the same trade policy.
   The proposal would end price controls on imported memory chips

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Pipeline companies that allegedly
profited illegally from higher natural gas prices in the early
1980s agreed to a $432 million settlement in an antitrust suit
brought by utilities.
   Consumers should get 100 percent of the settlement after legal
costs, probably in the form of credits on their bills and lower

have agreed to pay $1.4 million to the U.S. Treasury and a $35.5
million rebate to long-distance customers to resolve allegations
they overcharged customers through a subsidiary.
   The payment, announced Thursday, resolves apparent violations of
Federal Communications Commission rules governing transactions

   CHICAGO (AP) - United Airlines employees moved closer to their
proposed buyout of parent UAL Corp. after a Dutch bank agreed to
join four U.S. banks in loaning the employees' group $350 million

<HEAD>Playskool Makes a Run On Fisher Price, Turns Babies Into Big

<TEXT>
   Babies cost bucks. That translates into
big business for Playskool, a name once associated almost
exclusively with toys.
   Today, Playskool sells everything from sleepwear to safety
latches, bibs to cribs. It's in a close race with Fisher Price as
the leader in items for infants and toddlers.
   The number of products under the Playskool name has more than
tripled since 1983, said Bob Stebenne, president of Playskool Baby,
the division that deals with articles other than toys. Playskool
Baby will put more than 30 million products on the market this
year, he said.
   Playskool still makes a complete line of baby toys, including
Raggedy Ann dolls, Gumby, Lincoln Logs and Mr. Potato Head.
   Its 1991 line will include a $33 collapsible baby carrier for
parents on the go, a $5 snack dispenser that resembles a bird
feeder, and a versatile clothing line that grows with the child
through a system of fasteners.
   ``We are honestly the most diversified company out there when it
comes to what we do,'' Stebenne said, though Fisher Price disputes
that claim.
   The change at Playskool started about six years ago, after toy
maker Hasbro Inc., based in Pawtucket, R.I., acquired Playskool
with its takeover of Milton Bradley. By then, Hasbro already owned
Glenco Infant Items and its Tommee Tippee line.
   ``We changed that whole product range from Glenco to Playskool
because we knew we had a lot of equity in that Playskool name,''
Stebenne said in a telephone interview from Dallas, where he was
preparing for the Thursday opening of the annual Juvenile Products
Manufacturers Association convention.
   Through the rest of the decade, Playskool continued to expand.
It purchased Child Guidance from CBS Toys, the Pur line of infant
feeding and care products and introduced a line of medical products
for daily health care needs.
   Last year, Hasbro started licensing the Playskool name to
companies that make humidifiers, tape recorders and other types of
electronic equipment.
   ``I think the marketing concept quite honestly was, how can we
strengthen the Playskool brand name, and the way to do it was
introduce it to new moms both pre-natally and post-natally,'' said
Stebenne.
   An estimated 4.1 million babies will be born in the United
States this year, which gives Playskool and its competitors an
enormous opportunity to promote their items. Playskool Baby is
planning to give new parents about 2.2 million complimentary baby
baskets, which include coupons and free products.
   Overall, Playskool Baby estimates it will reach 70 percent to 80
percent of new parents through various marketing strategies,
Stebenne said.
   ``I think all companies are looking to broaden their product
offerings. I think Playskool just saw a number of niche
opportunities and went after them,'' said industry analyst Gary
Jacobson, of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   Bob Mann, executive vice president of Playskool, said he
believes the company took the lead in the infant toy market last
year from the Fisher Price division of Quaker Oats Co.
   But Strawn Cathcart, Fisher Price vice president of marketing,
says his company still leads that market, although it does not
offer medical products or safety items like outlet covers and
cabinet latches.
   ``We do a lot more than Playskool does,'' Cathcart said.
``Playskool does not, except through licensing, compete in the
juvenile business.''
   Still, industry analysts say Fisher Price has faltered recently,
allowing Playskool to gain an advantage.
   John McMillin, a Fisher Price analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, said that company faltered by
introducing too many expensive items that aren't selling well. The
result is that Fisher Price likely will only break even this year
after a decade of growth.
   ``We did introduce a number of high price products that proved
to be less than successful in the marketplace and we've taken care
of those problems,'' Cathcart said, ``but it does not for a minute
mean that we were taking our eyes off the infant and juvenile
area.''

<HEAD>Housing Construction Slump Has Florida Feeling Unemployment Pinch</HEAD>

   Real estate manager Lynn Mooney, whose turf
is the retirement community of Sun City Center, usually has her
hands full with retirees looking for a good buy. But this year is
different.
   Snowbirds, as the refugees from colder climes are known, are
having trouble unloading their homes. So for now, at least, they're
staying with the snow.
   ``With the real estate market so bad up north right now, it's
harder for them to just sell their homes and come down here - they
have to wait,'' Mooney said.
   And that, economists say, is hurting Florida's construction
business and unemployment rate, which at 6.7 percent is outpacing
the nation's 5.6 percent.
   ``We're seeing the same kind of ripple effect in just about
every state where retirees from the Northeast tend to settle,''
said Robert Villanueva, economic forecaster for the National
Association of Home Builders.
   He added that new housing starts in Florida have dropped 18
percent; in California, 19 percent.
   In the past, retirees would come to Sun City Center and plunk
down up to $300,000 for a new home - money they don't have now, Ms.
Mooney said.
   And some who do come are forced to take out mortgages or forgo
their dreams of a retirement home in favor of renting or moving
into a condominium, which also adds to the slump in new
construction.
   Construction unemployment took the biggest bite out of the
state's 5.5 million-person workforce, according to August figures
from the Florida Dpartment of Labor.
   Unemployment in construction rose nearly 5 percent in the past
year, accounting for 15,900 jobs. Depository institutions lost
6,000 jobs in the same period and manufacturing 5,000.
   While Florida's unemployment is high, none of the blame can go
to its biggest industry - tourism. Employment in the service
sector, which includes hotels and amusement parks, grew nearly 7
percent in the past year, picking up 105,000 new jobs.
   ``It's hard to pin unemployment on one thing,'' said Becky Rust,
an economist with Florida's Labor Market Information Bureau in
Tallahassee. ``High interest rates, expectations of a recession and
a continually growing population don't help at all.''
   Economists say those factors will also help to keep the state's
construction and related employment in the dumps for years.
   Villanueva predicts new home starts in Florida won't begin to
recover until at least the middle of the decade, with a slowdown in
the influx of retirees a factor.
   Demographer Stephen Golant of the University of Florida said
economics won't be the only reason for the retiree slowdown. In a
recent study, he predicted the drop will continue through the 1990s
as the population of the 65-74 age group shrinks in the nation's
colder climes.
   Between 199O and 2000, he predicts an 8 percent drop in the
number of elderly migrating to Florida from the Northeast and
Midwest.
   The 1980 census showed that, as migration peaked in the late
1970s, more than 80,000 people over age 60 were moving to Florida
annually.

<HEAD>Skepticism About UAL Deal Returns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skepticism about the proposed worker buyout of
UAL Corp. is returning even as United Airlines employees move
closer to getting bank financing for a bid.
   Analysts said a sharp drop in UAL's stock price Thursday
reflected investor doubts that UAL's board will accept the employee
offer, which is expected to value the airline company at $165 to
$175 per share, or $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
   The board accepted a bid from the group of $201-per-share or
$4.4 billion in April.
   The buyout group is racing to meet a Tuesday deadline imposed by
the board to put together financing for the deal.
   Samuel Buttrick, airline analyst with Kidder Peabody and Co.,
said that when the board gave the employees a two-month extension
on Aug. 9, ``the board made it clear that they would be hard
pressed to accept any offer that was not commensurate in value''
with the $201 per share bid.
   ``Are they going to take a $175 deal? They are under no mandate
to do so,'' said PaineWebber Inc. analyst Edward Starkman.
   UAL stock fell $6.37{ to $105.37{ a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The stock had risen earlier in the day after a Dutch bank agreed
to join four U.S. banks in each loaning the workers $350 million.
   About 20 other banks were to have responded by Thursday to
requests to participate in the deal, which requires at least $2
billion in bank financing.
   One person familiar with the transaction, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the four lead banks would not decide until at
least Friday whether the other banks had offered enough loan money,
in addition to the $1.75 billion already committed, to keep the
deal alive.
   The New York Times quoted unidentified sources Thursday as
saying bank financing was assured but the employee group still
lacked $1 billion in financial commitments from non-bank sources.
   The Dutch bank NMB Postbank Groep N.V. agreed to contribute $350
million in financing for the employee bid, said Greg Flynn,
vice-president for corporate finance, in a telephone interview from
New York.
   NMB was the first foreign bank to commit funds to the deal and
the first major lending institution to line up behind the four lead
banks: Bankers Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp.,
Security Pacific Corp., and First Chicago Corp.
   The lead banks' agreement was contingent on the participation of
other banks, most of them foreign, to complete the loan package, a
source told The Associated Press.
   The source said the lead banks wanted the total amount of bank
financing commitments to be ``well in excess of the $2 billion''
that the buyout group needs.

<HEAD>Government Considers Plan To Let Banks Advertise Trust Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission says he will impose securities rules on banks if another
federal regulator lets them advertise a type of trust fund that
could put them in competition with the trillion dollar mutual fund
industry.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency says that's okay
but notes that banks are exempt from certain SEC regulations.
   But the mutual fund industry is opposed to allowing banks to
advertise the trust funds will put investors at risk while giving
banks an unfair advantage over the more heavily regulated mutual
funds.
   Supporters and opponents of the proposed rule change aired their
views Thursday before the finance subcommittee of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, which oversees both the SEC and mutual
funds.
   Under the proposed change, the Comptroller of the Currency,
which regulates 4,000 national banks around the country, wants to
allow banks to advertise collective investment funds separately
from their other services.
   Bank trust departments are allowed to combine individual trusts,
like those maintained for wealthy widows and minors, into
collective funds for administrative purposes.
   The comptroller's office wants to lift a ban preventing banks
from advertising the availability and performance of those combined
funds, in effect, letting them be marketed as ersatz mutual funds.
   Mutual funds, small banks and some members of Congress have
criticized the proposal as risky after the savings and loan debacle
and reports of underfunding of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which guarantees bank deposits.
   There also is concern that financial products sold in banks will
give customers the impression they are federally insured, which
they are not. That was a problem arising out of the failure of
Lincoln Savings and Loan, where some investors lost their life
savings in securities sold at the thrift.
   ``Without appropriate safeguards in place the potential for
investor confusion is substantial,'' Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., said at a hearing before the finance subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee. Markey is chairman of the
panel.
   But Robert L. Clarke, the comptroller of the currency, said that
while the negative reaction is large, the issue is small.
   ``The revisions we are contemplating would not expand bank
powers,'' Clarke said. He said banks already are permitted to
advertise the service along with others but not separately.
   ``The government doesn't tell supermarkets that they cannot
advertise carrots unless they advertise all the other vegetables in
the produce section,'' he said. ``Why then should the government
keep banks from advertising common trust funds services separately
from other trust services?''
   Markey suggested that since Congress is trouble-shooting the
country's banking laws, the comptroller's office should wait to
implement the change until the Bush administration presents its
opinion.
   Clarke said afterward that he had no timetable for making a
decision.
   Supporters of the proposed change testifying Thursday included
Wells Fargo Bank's William E. Aldinger III, speaking for the
Coalition of Regional Banks, and Richard W. Heiss, of the
Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, representing the American
Bankers Association.
   Opponents included David Manning of the Community Bankers
Association of Illinois and Peggy Miller of the Consumer Federation
of America.
   The SEC doesn't oppose the change, but SEC Chairman Richard C.
Breeden told the panel it would impose its own regulations on banks
if they are allowed to market their collective trust funds.
   But Clarke noted that banks are exempt from two of the four laws
that govern mutual funds.
   Therefore the SEC would be unable to regulate the sales
practices of banks vending funds as it now can for mutual fund
salesmen. That would deny investors the protection of those laws,
Breeden said. ``In our view, the commission believes these
statutory exemptions for banks are no longer appropriate,'' he
said.
   David Silver, president of the Investment Company Institute,
which represents the mutual fund industry, said ``these loopholes
leave serious gaps for investor protection.''
   He said the industry doesn't oppose bank entry into the mutual
fund business as long as appropriate investor safeguards and equal
regulation are in place.
   Silver also warned that banks would be permitted to double
charge trust customers for management fees on the common trust fund
as well as the individual trust accounts.

<HEAD>Keating Asserts Fifth Amendment Rights in Administrative Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Former savings and loan owner Charles H.
Keating cannot fully defend himself against federal administrative
charges without risking a conviction in a separate criminal case,
his attorneys say.
   Keating asserted his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in a reply to the charges filed by the Office of
Thrift Supervision. He also asked OTS to postpone a hearing on the
case until after he resolves the criminal charges.
   Keating's lawyers, in documents released Thursday by OTS, said
it was difficult for their client to focus on the administrative
proceeding because he has been jailed since Sept. 18 in lieu of $5
million bail in the 42-count criminal indictment in Los Angeles.
   On Aug. 9, the thrift office filed administrative charges
seeking $40.9 million in reimbursement from Keating for his actions
as chairman of the American Continental Corp., the Phoenix-based
holding company for Lincoln Savings and Loan, based in Irvine,
Calif.
   It also sought to ban him from ever owning or working for a bank
or savings institution.
   His lawyers said further refusal to testify at a hearing would
risk an unfavorable ruling in the administrative case. But, they
said, waiving his Fifth Amendment rights would risk a conviction in
the criminal case, where Keating faces a maximum jail sentence of
10 years.
   ``Besides putting Mr. Keating in a no-win position, the very
real threat of future criminal prosecution would no doubt cause key
third-party defense witnesses to invoke their Fifth Amendment
rights in the (thrift office) proceeding, further undercutting Mr.
Keating's defense,'' they said.
   The government loses little by delaying the hearing because
Keating, with a negative net worth of $4 million, ``lacks the
wherewithal to satisfy any judgment,'' his attorneys said.
   Moreover, Keating is willing to agree not to participate in the
affairs of any federally insured depository institution, the
documents said.
   Regulators seized Lincoln in April 1989, later estimating the
taxpayer cost for protecting depositors at as much as $2 billion.
   Besides Keating, others asserting their Fifth Amendment rights
in the thrift office case are: Judy J. Wischer, former president
and chief executive officer of American Continental; Robert J.
Kielty, who was a senior vice president and general counsel of the
company; Charles H. Keating III, a former executive vice president
and the elder Keating's son; and two of Keating's sons-in-law who
were vice presidents, Robert J. Hubbard and Robert M. Wurzelbacher
Jr.
   In an unrelated case, Thomas Spiegel, former chief executive and
chairman of Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills,
Calif., denied thrift office charges filed against him July 5 and
amended Sept. 4.
   Spiegel was accused by the thrift office of squandering millions
of the S&amp;L's funds on luxury condominiums, limousines, a gun
collection and such exotica as ``survival chamber bathrooms with
bulletproof glass and an independent air and food supply.''
   In a reply dated Sept. 21 but released Thursday, Spiegel's
lawyers asked for dismissal of the charges and reimbursement from
the government for attorney's fees and other expenses.
   Columbia, which is under new management and has not been seized
by regulators, is the industry's largest holder of junk bonds.

   New England Telephone and New York Telephone
will make a voluntary $1.4 million payment to the U.S. Treasury and
cut their long-distance rates $35.5 million to resolve allegations
that they overcharged customers from 1984 to 1988.
   The $1.4 million payment, announced Thursday as part of a
consent decree between the companies and the Federal Communications
Commission, is a record amount and is identical to a proposed fine
the FCC had announced in February.
   But the FCC said the payment was not a fine and it was making no
finding of wrongdoing. The commission said it was ending its
enforcement action against the companies.
   The $35.5 million is the interstate portion of an alleged $118.5
million in overcharges for equipment, supplies and services the FCC
had said the two phone companies paid Materiel Enterprises Co., the
unregulated purchasing arm of New York-based NYNEX Corp., from 1984
to 1988. NYNEX is the parent firm of New York and New England
Telephone,
   The FCC had said the $35.5 million was charged to long-distance
companies such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., MCI and US
Sprint for connecting with the local phone network. The
long-distance companies pass those charges on to residential and
business customers.
   Toby Webb, NYNEX vice president for government affairs, said he
could not estimate how much long-distance phone bills would be
affected by the $35.5 million rebate.
   Local phone rates will not be affected.
   NYNEX agreed to the $35.5 million rebate, to be made within 30
days, and also said the two phone companies would reduce their
capital accounts by $32.6 million to ``remove the alleged excess
profits on plant and equipment purchased from MECO (Materiel
Enterprises).''
   ``We hope this puts to rest any questions concerning NYNEX's
desire to comply with all FCC regulations and policies in
transactions among affiliate companies,'' NYNEX Chairman William C.
Ferguson said in a statement.
   NYNEX had claimed the FCC was incorrectly subjecting NYNEX to
accounting rules that were established in 1977 for AT&amp;T and its
unregulated affiliate, Western Electric Co. NYNEX said Thursday it
continued to hold that view.
   Webb said the $1.4 million contribution to the Treasury will be
paid by NYNEX shareholders, and will not effect telephone rates.
   He estimated the consent decree would have an effect of about 12
cents per share on earnings in the third quarter. ``That doesn't
mean per-share earnings will go down by that much,'' since other
factors are involved, he added.
   The agreement ends one of several pending federal or state
actions against NYNEX, one of the seven regional Bell holding
companies that were created in 1984 from the old Bell System.
   NYNEX also has been the focus of investigations into bawdy
parties in Florida for NYNEX employees and vendors that included
prostitutes. NYNEX has denied that any ratepayer funds were
involved in the conventions.
   In May, the Justice Department filed a one-count criminal
indictment alleging that NYNEX had violated the information
services restrictions in the 1982 consent decree that created the
regional Bell companies. NYNEX denied any wrongdoing.
   On Wednesday, New York state utility regulators authorized a
study into whether NYNEX should be forced to divest New York
Telephone.
   In its February announcement, the commission said New York
Telephone, New England Telephone MECO apparently had violated FCC
rules governing transactions between regulated telephone companies
and an unregulated affiliates.
   FCC Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett said in a statement Thursday
he believed the FCC could have won its case in court.
   However, he said the commission still had sent a clear message
to phone companies that ``if they violate our rules, they should be
prepared to pay the penalty.''

   America's climbing unemployment rate, which
has fanned fears that the nation is skidding into a recession,
isn't expected to improve any time soon, analysts say.
   They will get their first look at the nation's economic activity
for September with today's release of the Labor Department's
unemployment report.
   In advance of the report's release, many economists said the
unemployment rate probably rose last month to 5.7 percent from
August's 5.6 percent.
   That would mark the third consecutive jump in the jobless rate
and put it well above the 5.2 percent rate recorded in June. In
July and August, the ranks of the jobless swelled by 550,000 people
as the unemployment rate for the two-month period jumped 0.4
percentage points.
   The recent increase in joblessness reflects a U.S. economy that
was showing little signs of life even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring and increased fears of an
imminent recession.
   An uptick to a 5.7 percent unemployment rate - which would be
the highest level in more than two years - would provide further
evidence of an economic downturn, said Allen Sinai, chief economist
at the Boston Co.
   ``A rise to 5.7 percent does not suggest a caving in of the
economy - it simply underscores the slide,'' said Sinai, one of
many analysts who believe the nation is already in a recession.
Government data to back up the theory is not yet available.
   Many analysts expected the Labor Department's report to probably
show that the nation's industries produced around 50,000 new jobs
last month, excluding the lost jobs caused by the temporary census
workers laid off by the government.
   A jobs gain of 50,000 would be considered mediocre, especially
when compared with the robust jobs gains of last year, when the
economy was producing nearly 200,000 jobs a month.
   Before the recent rise in unemployment - caused largely by the
economy's failure to produce many new jobs - the jobless rate had
stayed relatively low and stable, fluctuating within a tenth of a
percentage point of 5.3 percent for much of the past year and
one-half.
   Many economists say the only reason the unemployment rate has
not risen faster in recent months is because fewer Americans are
entering the work force.
   ``One of these months, there will be a more normal growth in the
labor force, on top of weak jobs growth. We'll see a big jump in
the unemployment rate and it will be very scary,'' Sinai said.

   Stock prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today, but the gains were held in check by Congress' failure to
pass the proposed U.S. budget. The dollar, meanwhile, plunged
against the yen.
   Analysts said the surge higher indicated investors had digested
the Finance Minstry's market-propping measures announced Monday and
were less skittish about the Middle East crisis.
   The government's steps included slightly shorter trading times
for stock options and an increase in margin deposits, which went
into effect today.
   Stocks continued to receive support from U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments earlier in the week that hinted
lower interest rates were likely.
   But news of the U.S. budget's failure hit the market in the
early afternoon, depressing the day's gains. ``Just at the time you
think you are out of it, the bear market swats you upside the head
again,'' said Darryl Whitten, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
analyst.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected stocks rebounded 549.46
points, or 2.47 percent, to close at 22,827.65. It fell 571.20
points, or 2.56 percent, on Thursday.
   Trading was moderate on the first section, with an estimated 450
million shares changing hands.
   Masaki Sumi, a manager at Sanyo Securities, said that beyond the
Finance Ministry's measures, ``fundamentally . . . you can't find
many positive factors. So most institutional investors are
sidelined. And a small amount of buying can push up prices.''
   Traders said big losses have kept institutional investors out of
the market. As of Thursday, the Nikkei had lost 27.76 percent of
its value before Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Negatives such as inflationary pressures and higher oil prices
are expected to keep interest rates high.
   The usual bear market that chases a long bull session probably
will last until well into 1991, despite the record bounce on
Tuesday after the Finance Ministry's announcement, Whitten said.
   On Tuesday, the market scored a 2,676.55-point surge, its
biggest in history.
   The direction of trading next week will depend on how Wall
Street responds to the budget's failure and to U.S. September
unemployment figures, due out today in Washington, he said.
   The dollar, meanwhile, suffered from the stock market's rise,
the prospect of lower interest rates in the United States and from
a weakening U.S. economy. Lower interest rates tend to curb demand
for dollars by making returns on dollar-denominated investments
less attractive.
   The dollar closed at 133.72 yen, down 2.18 from Thursday's
close.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds dropped to 8.110 percent by 3 p.m. from
Thursday's 8.235 percent close. Their price rose to 83.15 points
from 82.63.

   The U.S. dollar rose against major foreign
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said the vote by the U.S. Congress to reject the
deficit-cutting budget package boosted the dollar.
   The deficit reduction deal was expected to lead to lower U.S.
interest rates, but with its rejection interest rates are now
expected to remain high, dealers said. Higher interest rates make
dollar-denominated securities more attractive to investors.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 2.18 yen to a closing 133.72 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 133.12 yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9125, compared
with $1.9115 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.5372 German marks, up from 1.5340;
1.2847 Swiss francs, up from 1.2760; 5.1473 French francs, up from
5.1400; 1.7340 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7300; 1,150.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,150.00, and 1.1500 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1485.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$393.00 an ounce at midmorning, down from $396.25 bid late
Thursday. In Zurich, the bid price was $393.20, down from $396.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.47 to close at a bid
$391.95.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.69 a troy ounce,
down from Thursday's $4.71.

   The government's rail inspection system isn't
good enough to guarantee that trains are running safely, the
General Accounting Office said today.
   Last year, the government failed to inspect 1,164 miles of
track, skipping over 18 percent of all railroads that own track.
The Federal Railroad Administration also did not verify the
accuracy of 54 percent of the accident or incident reports filed by
railroads, said the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``FRA does not have assurance that the nation's 580 railroads
are running safely,'' GAO Associate Director John W. Hill Jr. said
in testimony submitted for a hearing today by the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on transportation, tourism and hazardous
materials.
   ``We found that 32 railroads did not receive any type of
inspection in 1989. Typically, these were the smaller, short-line
railroads, which have higher accident and injury rates than overall
industry averages,'' Hill said.
   Because there are no standards telling railroad inspectors how
often they must examine tracks, signals, equipment and operating
practices, there is no way to know whether the lack of annual
inspections translates into a special safety risk, he said.
   The GAO also criticized the FRA for failing to pay special
attention to railroads with poor safety histories or a string of
accidents.
   ``While the number of Union Pacific accidents in Idaho more than
doubled between 1986 and 1988, the total number of Union Pacific
inspections in Idaho decreased nearly 38 percent during this time
period,'' Hill said.
   Federal Railroad Administrator Gilbert E. Carmichael said the
report ``broadly confirms many of my own conclusions.''
   ``FRA must improve the training of its inspectors ... and it
must use its data more scientifically in planning inspections and
in assuring consistent application of safety regulations,'' he
said.
   But Carmichael also said that rail safety improved during the
1980s. He said his agency's success should be measured by ``overall
safety performance from the railroads'' and not ``whether each
instance of noncompliance is corrected.''

<HEAD>TWA Planning Layoffs Due To Higher Fuel Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines, struggling with
increasing fuel prices, is expected to issue lay-off notices to as
many as 500 employees across the country today.
   TWA Spokesman Donald Morrison said Thursday the layoffs would
center on management and clerical employees and would not disrupt
service.
   ``This whole thing is fuel-related,'' Morrison said. ``It
doesn't have anything to do with everything else that is going
on.''
   In the United States, TWA is paying more than 90 cents a gallon
for jet fuel - roughly twice as much as before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   More layoffs, and possibly flight reductions, could come later,
Morrison said. TWA, which has its hub in St. Louis, has about
33,000 employees worldwide. The cuts are expected to affect about
100 of the roughly 8,000 workers in St. Louis.
   The airline has been taking other steps to cut costs to counter
the surge in fuel prices and a slowdown in travel.
   In the past two weeks, the steadily shrinking carrier has
decided to pull out of two more cities, close its flight base in
Los Angeles and stop hiring and training new pilots and flight
attendants.
   TWA also put the squeeze on its advertising agency, Young &amp;
Rubicam Inc., but its bid for lower rates backfired when the firm
took the unusual step of giving up the airline's $45 million
account.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn, told The Wall Street Journal that the
airline would replace Young &amp; Rubicam by doing some of the work
itself and hiring a ``small creative shop'' to do the rest.
   TWA said Wednesday that it might make even more cuts in the new
schedule that takes effect Oct. 28. The airline already has
announced it will pull out of Harrisburg, Pa., and Oslo, Norway.
   Since the beginning of the year, TWA has abandoned Long Beach
and Burbank, Calif.; Madison, Wis.; Midway Airport in Chicago;
Freeport and Nassau in the Bahamas; and Stuttgart, Germany.
   Last week, the airline said it intended to close its pilot base
in Los Angeles on Jan. 1 and shift about 300 West Coast crew
members to bases in New York and St. Louis.
   Icahn told leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association that cost
studies showed the closing would save the carrier money over the
next two years.
   The union is questioning that claim, saying the expense of
retraining pilots who shift to new cockpit positions or new
equipment might eclipse the projected savings.
   Three of TWA's rivals - USAir Group Inc., Pan Am Corp. and
Midway Airlines Inc. - already have announced layoffs in response
to the problems that have gripped the industry.
   TWA, headquartered in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., lost $300 million last
year and had to pay $366 million in interest on debt totaling $2.5
billion.

<HEAD>UAL Chairman Sold Stock Below Price Sought in Buyout: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen M. Wolf sold most of
his UAL stock rights far below the price he has asked from the
union group trying to buy the company, according to a report
published today.
   Wolf sold 200,000 of his 208,333 stock rights for $150 per share
this spring, the Wall Street Journal reported. John C. Pope, UAL's
chief financial officer, recently sold 50,000 of his 60,000 rights,
the Journal reported, citing unnamed persons familiar with the
transaction.
   The union group trying to buy the parent company of United
Airlines is racing to meet a Tuesday deadline to secure financing.
UAL's board accepted a $201-per-share, $4.4 billion bid in April.
But the employee group is expected to value the airline at $165 to
$175 per share, or $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
   Wolf was concerned the union group would find a way to nullify
his rights if he waited to sell until after the buyout was
complete, the newspaper said.
   Wolf and Pope sold the rights ``in light of (the unions')
clearly stated intent to replace them with their own senior
management'' if the buyout succeeds, a spokesman for Wolf told the
paper.
   Union officials discounted that explanation, saying Wolf would
not have lost his rights under a change of management, the Journal
reported.
   ``He obviously has no interest in seeing the deal close,'' a
union official said.
   ``It would be pretty inconsistent for (UAL directors) to say
shareholders can't get $170 today when Wolf sold for $150,'' said a
UAL shareholder who asked not be named.
   ``We're offering the shareholders more (than $150 a share),''
said Frederick C. Dubinsky, president of the United pilots union,
one of the unions involved in the buyout bid. ``How can Wolf tell
the board our offer isn't enough?''
   Wolf has denied trying to block the buyout bid.
   UAL stock fell $6.37{ to $105.37{ a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock has traded as low as $87.25 since
Wolf sold his shares.

   Kirin Brewery Co. said Friday it will establish a
joint venture with Tropicana Products Inc. to market orange juice
and frozen fruit products in Japan.
   Kirin, Japan's leading beer brewer, said the new company will
begin marketing Tropicana 100 percent orange juice and frozen items
in Tokyo's metropolitan area in March. The company tentatively is
called Kirin-Tropicana.
   Florida-based Tropicana, the largest U.S. orange juice maker,
would be an equal partner in the venture. The deal will enable
Kirin to add U.S. brand-name juices as well as its own frozen
products to its product line, while easing Tropicana's entry into
the Japanese market.
   The venture comes ahead of the scheduled 1992 liberalization of
U.S. oranges into Japan's orange market.

<HEAD>Polly Peck May Sell Del Monte Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polly Peck International PLC may seek to raise
cash by selling a stake in its Del Monte fruit and produce business
to the public early next year, reports published today said.
   The Wall Street Journal said proceeds from a possible sale of 40
percent of Del Monte for $400 million would be used to pay off some
of Polly Peck's $1.58 billion in long-term debt.
   The Journal account, quoting unidentified sources close to the
company, said the public offering also would ease pressure from
short-term lenders, who have clamped down on credit lines to Polly
Peck.
   Separately, the London-based Financial Times quoted Polly Peck
Chairman Asil Nadir saying the interest in Del Monte would offered
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Polly Peck bought Del Monte, the world's largest distributor of
bananas, last year from RJR Nabisco Inc. for $875 million. Polly
Peck also has interests in consumer electronics and the leisure
industry.
   Polly Peck's lines of credit were tightened after the Sept. 20
trading suspension in the company's shares. The suspension stemmed
from an inquiry by Britain's Serious Fraud Office into a possible
stock manipulation scheme in Polly Peck shares.
   The suspension, which is still in force, has given Polly Peck a
liquidity problem, the company said earlier this week.
   Bankers for the cash-starved conglomerate were meeting with the
company's managers today to discuss the liquidity problem and
arrange a credit package.
   The critical meeting came as the Foreign Office confirmed a
report in today's Financial Times that Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd sent a message to the Turkish government last week.
   The Financial Times said the telegram, signed by Hurd, called on
the Turkish government to provide about $190 million to rescue the
embattled company, which is a major employer in Turkish-occupied
Cyprus.
   Hurd's letter was in reply to a letter received from Turkish
Economics Minister which said that Turkey was considering aid to
Polly Peck, the Financial Times said.

<TEXT>
   America's unemployment rate posted its third
consecutive increase in September, rising to 5.7 percent, the
government reported today as the economy continued to flash warning
signals of an impending recession.
   The 0.1 percentage point increase pushed the jobless rate to its
highest level since the spring of 1988 and private economists
predicted even higher unemployment figures in the months ahead,
reflecting a deteriorating U.S. economy.
   More industries lost jobs than gained them in September, causing
an overall loss of 101,000 jobs from non-farm payrolls, the Labor
Department said. About 42,000 of those were census workers laid off
by the government.
   It marked the first time since the 1981-82 recession that the
unemployment rate increased three months in a row, the government
said.
   While the Bush administration continues to insist that the
country can avoid a recession, a growing number of economists think
the country has either already entered a recession or will be in
one before the end of the year.
   ``It's an economy that's started the slide down the slippery
slope,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern
Trust Co. of Chicago. ``The weakness has become more diffused,
which is characteristic of an economy losing ground.''
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
noted the weakness in September's jobs data had hit factories and
service industries alike.
   ``Few areas of the economy are escaping the downward tug of the
current economic slowdown,'' Mrs. Norwood said.
   Last month's 5.7 percent jobless rate was the highest since it
was that same level in March 1988; the unemployment rate hasn't
been worse since it was 5.8 percent in November 1987.
   The nation's employment picture began a downward spiral in July,
as the nation's economy began failing to produce enough jobs to
keep up with the number of Americans looking for work. Since then,
the jobless rate has risen 0.5 percentage points from June's rate
of 5.2 percent.
   The rapid jump in the jobless rate over the past three months
reflected a U.S. economy that was showing little signs of life even
before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring and
increased fears of an imminent downturn.
   The 101,000-job loss in September, though inflated by the census
workers, was the biggest job decline since the economy lost 104,000
jobs in June 1986, the government said. A year ago, the economy was
producing nearly 200,000 new jobs a month.
   The nation's jobless rate is derived from a household survey.
But most economists consider a separate survey of business
establishments - from which the government gets its figures on how
many new jobs were created in a given month - a better barometer of
economic activity.
   The slump in the manufacturing sector continued in September, as
factory jobs posted a 66,000 job loss. It was the 17th time out of
18 months that manufacturing jobs declined.
   Since reaching a post recession peak in January 1989, the
manufacturing sector has lost more than 500,000 jobs, the
government said.
   In September, construction also continued on its downward slide,
posting the fourth decline in as many months to reflect weakness in
the housing market. After seasonal adjustment, construction jobs
fell by 20,000, bringing losses in the industry to more than
100,000 in recent months.
   The service-producing sector, which until a few months ago had
been enjoying robust job growth and providing most of the economy's
steam, actually lost 17,000 jobs in September. Within the sector,
the services industry itself, which employs one in four non-farm
workes, added only 20,000 jobs, one of the smallest gains since
the 1981-82 recession.
   Health services, which had added an average of 50,000 jobs each
month in the first half of this year, continued to show healthy
gains, adding 45,000 jobs last month.
   Labor costs, which are frequently blamed for worsening the
nation's inflation problems, rose a sharp 0.5 percent. The average
hourly worker made $10.13 an hour in September, up from the $10.08
made in August.
   The Labor Department's household survey showed that overall,
total civilian employment was about 117.9 million in September, up
from the 117.7 million employed in August.
   The jobless numbered nearly 7.1 million, slightly up from the 7
million employed in August.
   The average manufacturing workweek was 41 hours in September,
unchanged from August. Manufacturing overtime was 3.7 hours last
month, down from August's average of 3.8 overtime hours.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the September
jobless rate was 5.6 percent, up from the 5.5 percent in August but
lower than September's civilian rate of 5.7 percent.
   The unemployment rate among major demographic groups last month
was:
   -Adult white men, 4.3 percent, unchanged from August.
   -Adult white women, 4.2 percent, unchanged from August.
   -White teen-agers, 12.5 percent, down from 13.2 percent.
   -All blacks, 12.1 percent, up from 11.8 percent.
   -Adult black men, 11.8 percent, up from 10.6 percent.
   -Adult black women, 10.3 percent, up from 9.9 percent.
   -Black teen-agers, 26.9 percent, down from 35 percent.
   -Hispanics, 8.7 percent, up from 7.8 percent.

   The stock market declined broadly today as
traders responded to the rejecion of a government budget plan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 24.75 to 2,492.08
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 199 up,
1,086 down and 422 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 48.30 million shares at
midmorning.
   The selloff at the opening had been widely predicted following
the overnight news that the House had defeated the budget proposal
worked out last weekend by President Bush and congressional
leaders.
   Analysts said that development dismayed investors who had pinned
their hopes on some tangible signs of progress in the struggle to
narrow the government's chronic deficit.
   But after the initial wave of selling passed, the market
steadied. Brokers said hopes lingered that Congress might come up
with an alternative budget plan.
   Separately, the Labor Department issued monthly statistics
showing an increase in the unemployment rate and a drop in nonfarm
payroll employment.
   The figures, which came in a bit weaker than expected, were
taken as corroborating evidence that the economy is close to or
already in a recession. Some observers also saw them, however, as
cause for hope that interest rates might soon decline.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down ~ at 107; General Electric, down \ at 54&lsqb;; Philip
Morris, down { at 47{, and Pepsico, down { at 24\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.60 to 169.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.71 at 305.43.

   Rising imports and overseas tourism helped slash
Japan's trade and services surplus by 72.5 percent in August from
the same month last year, the Finance Ministry said Friday.
   Despite some fluctuations, the surplus in the current account,
the widest measure of a nation's trade in goods and services, has
generally been declining in recent months.
   That has been good news to Japanese officials pressured by
trading partners, particularly the United States, to cut the
surplus.
   August's drop to $942 million from $3.43 billion in August 1989
was the largest decline in the surplus since January, when it
registered a deficit for the first time in six years.
   In July, the current account surplus fell 63 percent from a year
earlier to $2.02 billion, following a moderate 12 percent rise the
previous month.
   The ministry said Japan's August trade surplus, which measures
only goods, fell 15.4 percent from the previous year to $4.12
billion.
   Imports rose 7.2 percent to $17.77 billion for their fifth
consecutive month of increase. The value of imports was the
fourth-largest ever, the ministry said.
   Ministry officials said the effect of higher oil prices from
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait did not surface during the month.
   Although the total volume of Japan's crude oil imports rose 4.8
percent from August 1989 to 18.1 million kiloliters, the total
value dropped 0.4 percent to $1.86 billion because of lower prices,
the ministry said.
   The officials said the impact of higher oil prices was likely to
start being felt in October trade figures.
   Auto imports in August rose 21.6 percent, while imports of
machinery such as office equipment rose 7.1 percent. Art imports
surged 160.3 percent.
   Exports rose for the third consecutive month, despite the recent
strengthening of the yen against the dollar. They edged up 2.1
percent to $21.89 billion, in part because of stronger exports of
automobiles, up 6.4 percent, and audio-video equipment, up 7.5
percent, ministry officials said.
   But the officials said the chief cause of the drop in the
current account surplus was a rise in the ``invisible'' trade
deficit - which includes investment flows and tourism - to its
second-highest level ever.
   The tourism deficit rose to $2.09 billion in August, surpassing
the record deficit set in August 1989 of $1.96 billion.
   Ministry officials said 1.09 million Japanese went abroad in
August, the first time that more than 1 million people left the
country during one month.
   Economists also pointed to a growing deficit in capital flows.
The long-term capital account deficit in August was $4.84 billion,
up sharply from $3.63 billion in August 1989, the ministry said.

   A cut in short-term interest rates by the
Federal Reserve Board could take months to affect the economy and
even then it might be too little too late, economists say.
   Some say that regardless of what type of federal budget
agreement ultimately is approved, they expect the central bank to
moderately lower its target for the Federal Funds rate, the
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 7} percent
from 8 percent.
   But as the economy moves closer to recession, it moves further
from the Fed's control, analysts say.
   ``The Fed is going to be pretty much impotent to stop what's
already on track,'' said Ray Stone, of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc., referring to beliefs that the economy is already
in a recession or quickly headed for one.
   Such a small cut in the Fed Funds rate may be absorbed by banks
trying to bolster earnings and never affect consumer and business
loans through a cut in the prime rate, said John Lonski, chief
economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc., a debt-rating agency.
   A lower Fed Funds rate would mean banks would pay a smaller
wholesale price for money. Banks could widen their profit margin by
holding the prime rate steady.
   ``Twenty five basis points (one-fourth of a percentage point)
for the most part will help shore up bank earnings. Whether or not
we'll see any discernible difference in lending rates remains to be
seen,'' Lonski said.
   Lonski and others anticipate another 25 basis point cut in the
Fed Funds rate before long. That would likely be enough to affect
the prime, he said.
   It might be a longshot, but a move to lower interest rates could
have a psychological impact on consumers by making them more
confident that the economy will recover soon.
   Consumer confidence has sagged and, as people feel less secure
in their jobs, they are more prone to spend less money. A signal
that the Fed is trying to move the economy could boost spending.
   ``Maybe they'll go out and buy that new car,'' Stone said.
   Others were more skeptical.
   As far as consumer attitudes are concerned, more people will be
looking to the Persian Gulf than the Federal Reserve, said Alan
Levenson, of the Wefa Group, an economic forecasting firm in
suburban Philadelphia.
   Moreover, it's doubtful most consumers know or care what the Fed
Funds rate is doing.
   ``What the man on the street wants to see is a reduction in the
cost in borrowing from banks such as a significant downward
movement in variable rate mortgages,'' Lonski said.
   Economists warn that although Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is
confident that congressional approval of a credible budget
agreement would lead to lower short-term interest rates, plans to
ease monetary policy could still be scuttled.
   Members of the House, fearful of taking tax hikes and spending
cuts to their constituents less than a month before an election,
stalled passage of a compromise package of tax increases and
spending cuts.
   The House on Friday rejected the $500 billion deficit-reduction
proposal backed by President Bush and Greenspan. An alternative
proposal might not be to Greenspan's liking and could steer the Fed
away from following a more generous credit course.
   Then there's inflation.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has been sending oil prices on a
roller-coaster ride, fanning inflation fears.
   More proof of the negative impact the Middle East situation is
having on U.S. inflation will be available in a few weeks. The
Labor Department will release the September Consumer Price Index on
Oct. 18. It is expected to show a 1 percent jump.
   Many analysts have noted the Fed appears more concerned with
controlling inflation by keeping interest rates high than with
spurring economic activity by cutting borrowing rates.
   The rise in oil prices, the budget impasse and the weaker
dollar, which increases the price of imports, have been blamed for
inhibiting the Fed.
   Even assuming that Congress eventually cracks the budget
deadlock, economists still warn that a sharp rise in prices could
spook the Fed from relaxing its guard against inflation.

   General Motors Corp.'s new Saturn cars will
carry a base price as low as $7,995 and a money-back guarantee good
for a month, considerably more attractive terms than industry
analysts had foreseen.
   Saturn Corp., GM's first new division in 58 years, said Thursday
its four models of sedans and coupes will go on sale Oct. 25 at
Saturn dealerships in the South, West and Southeast. The cars had
been expected to have a base price as high as $12,000.
   ``We know we're in the most competitive segment of the small car
market,'' Saturn President Richard S. LeFauve told dealers at a
meeting in Nashville, Tenn., Thursday night.
   Saturn officials have said they expect 80 percent of the
projected 250,000 annual car sales will come from people who
seriously considered buying imported vehicles.
   Depending on model, the Saturn will be competing against the
Toyota Corolla or Camry, Nissan Sentra, Honda Civic, Mazda Protege
or Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   However, Saturn cars also will be going against the Chevrolet
Corsica, Beretta and Cavalier and Geo Prizm, all sold by GM
dealers. Analysts have wondered how deep Saturn sales will cut into
GM sales, despite what LeFauve and other GM executives have said.
   Base prices for the four Saturn models will be: Sports Sedan,
$7,995 or $8,595 depending on trim level; Sports Touring Sedan,
$10,295; and Sports Coupe, $11,775.
   Saturn owners dissatisfied for any reason will be able to return
their new cars within 30 days or 1,500 miles for a full refund. A
roadside protection plan will go along with each Saturn sold.
   Volkswagen and GM's Oldsmobile divisions currently offer
buy-back programs. Oldsmobile and some expensive European and
Japanese automakers, including Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor
Corp.'s Lexus Division, also offer roadside assistance programs.

   Stock prices fell today as traders responded to
the rejection of a government budget plan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.87 to
2,503.96 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 369 up, 989
down and 436 unchanged.
   The selloff at the opening had been widely predicted following
the overnight news that the House had defeated the budget proposal
worked out last weekend by President Bush and congressional
leaders.
   Analysts said that development dismayed investors who had pinned
their hopes on some tangible signs of progress in the struggle to
narrow the government's chronic deficit.
   But after the initial wave of selling passed, the market
steadied. Brokers said hopes lingered that Congress might come up
with an alternative budget plan.
   Separately, the Labor Department issued monthly statistics
showing an increase in the unemployment rate and a drop in nonfarm
payroll employment.
   The figures, which came in a bit weaker than expected, were
taken as corroborating evidence that the economy is close to or
already in a recession. Some observers also saw them, however, as
cause for hope that interest rates might soon decline.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down \ at 107|; Pepsico, down &rsqb; at 24&rsqb;; Philip Morris,
down \ at 47}, and Abbott Laboratories, down &rsqb; at 40\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.88 to 170.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.20 at 305.94.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.53 million shares at
noontime, against 72.87 million at the same point Thursday.

   The British pound will enter Europe's exchange
rate mechanism, a move that will link the currency closely to its
European neighbors and limit exchange rate movements, an official
said today.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said that as part of the
move, which will take effect Monday, a key British interest rate
will simultaneously drop by one percentage point to 14 percent.
   Joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism symbolizes Britain's
willingness to participate in European integration ahead of 1992,
when Europe is scheduled to meld into one marketplace of 220
million consumers.
   Despite the cooperative stance, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
still remains opposed to creating single a European central bank
and a single currency.
   The pound, which had been rising in anticipation of the
announcement, surged on the news to $1.9360 from $1.9185 in early
trading. Against the German mark, the pound also catapulted, to
2.9953 marks from 2.9492 marks. Stock prices also soared.
   The European Community's Monetary Committee is likely to approve
the British plan for the pound to join the European Monetary
System's ERM.
   Under the terms of entry, national central banks are obliged to
prevent their currencies from falling outside prescribed bands by
direct market intervention.
   The move, which takes a free-floating pound and ties it to other
currencies, should limit disruptive exchange rate movements and
promote economic stability.
   A high pound also should help fight inflation by lowering the
cost of imports.
   Thatcher agreed in principle to link the pound to the other
currencies at a community summit meeting in Madrid last year but
said she would move only when Britain's inflation rate was lower.
However, the government went ahead despite the current high
inflation rate of 10.6 percent.
   The pound will enter the mechanism at a central rate of 2.9500
German marks and, like the Spanish peseta, will be allowed to
fluctuate by 6 percent above or below that rate, the Treasury said.
   The other participating currencies are limited to a narrow 2.25
percent band.
   Rates have been adjusted 12 times since the mechanism's
inception 11 years ago, the mechanism has avoided any major
adjustments to rates in the last 3 12 years.
   The other currencies already in the mechanism are the German
mark, the French franc, the Dutch guilder, the Italian lira, the
Belgian and Luxembourg francs, the Danish krone, and the Irish
pound.
   Not participating are the Portuguese escudo and the Greek
drachma.

<HEAD>Regulators Want Accounting Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission wants
the accounting profession to change methods.
   Whoa! Don't stop reading yet!
   Altering the way the bean-counters count could mean big
differences in the way a company reports its financial health. That
could have far-reaching effects on your employer, investments and
future.
   ``As we enter the decade of the 1990s, we should consider a
fundamental shift in the goal we set for the accounting standards
for financial institutions,'' SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told
the Senate Banking Committee.
   Had such a change been undertaken years ago, for example, it may
have helped avoid one of the worst financial debacles of all time:
the thrift industry's collapse, estimated to cost American
taxpayers $500 billion over the next 40 years.
   How thrift assets were counted made all the difference, said
Breeden. Using the currently approved method, savings &amp; loans
showed a healthy surplus in assets - the cash, securities and real
estate they controlled.
   But when the thrifts began failing and the government took them
over and began selling off those assets, the market value turned
out to be a deficit, largely because of the accounting for the debt
securities, which had made them grossly overvalued.
   Present accounting standards, known as Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles or GAAP, allow financial institutions to
count debt securities one of two ways depending upon whether they
were bought for trading purposes or for long term investment.
   ``That treatment exalts psychology over economic worth,''
Breeden said in a recent interview. ``I mean it comes down to an
exercise for the regulators and accountants to try and determine
what the motivation or intent was with respect to the holding of
that security.''
   If the debt securities are being held for investment, their
value is listed as the purchase price or historic cost, whereas if
they were bought with imminent trading in mind, they have to be
listed at their true value on the market, a practice known as
marked to market.
   In essence, it's like picking grapes, leaving them in the sun
and still calling them grapes long after they've turned to raisins.
   For example, says Breeden, take a hypothetical financial
institution that buys $1 billion in 30-year Treasury notes for
investment.
   ``The very next year they fell to $900 million. The idea that
for the next 29 years that loss can be carried as if it didn't
happen, it demonstrates the degree of distortion that can result
from this distinction based on investment intent vs. trading
intent,'' said Breeden, who as a White House aide, helped draft the
thrift bailout legislation.
   Breeden has made changing that distinction a top priority and
has called in officials of the top accounting standards-setting
groups to persuade them.
   The SEC oversees the accounting profession because accountants
must certify the accuracy of financial statements that companies
file with the agency.
   But in the past, the SEC has left most of the rule-making
authority to private industry organizations.
   The most important are the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
which sets the general rules for accounting, GAAP, and the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which oversees testing
of certified public accountants and provides accounting principles
for specialized industries such as financial institutions.
   These groups tend to move cautiously when considering changes.
Last month, the accounting institute's standards committee withdrew
a proposal that would have created tougher standards for financial
institutions' accounting methods but stopped short of a complete
rollback after the SEC complained.
   At a meeting earlier this month with officials of the standards
board and the accounting institute, Breeden urged them to
reconsider guidelines for listing debt securities on financial
institutions' balance sheets.
   ``We've committed to get back to chairman Breeden within 30 days
on whether or not we are willing to undertake tis project,'' said
   Thomas Kelley, vice president of the accounting institute, said
the accounting officials pledged to give Breeden a response to his
proposal in 30 days. But Kelley said the earliest such a change
could take place would be the end of 1991.
   ``There's no question something has to be done,'' said Walter
Primhoff, director of professional programs for the New York State
Society of Certified Public Accountants. But he expressed worry
over too much SEC meddling.
   ``The SEC has not very often interfered in this process,'' he
said. ``There's only been a few times where they've come in and
said `We don't like what you did with the rule, we're going to
change it.'
   ``If it happens occasionally it just shows there is a
responsible public oversight but if it becomes a very frequent
occurence, accounting standards will become politicized, and if
they do, the people who rely on them for making decisions probably
will be forced to rely on them less.''
   Eventually the SEC may push beyond the limited issue of debt
securities at financial institutions.
   But even Breeden concedes ``moving beyond that to other types of
assets is a direction that we think ought to be pursued but that
has to be done very carefully and very deliberately.''
   One of the other four SEC commissioners, Philip R. Lochner Jr.,
said the commission has taken no action yet to explore a wider use
of market price accounting.
   ``It's kind of premature to go beyond that. We may go much
farther but I'm just speaking for myself,'' said Lochner.

<HEAD>Woolrich to Lay Off More Than Half Its 2,600 Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOOLRICH, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Woolrich Inc., which primarily manufactures
outdoor clothing, will lay off more than half its 2,600 employees
nationwide because it has few orders for deliveries beyond
December, the company said.
   In a letter delivered to employees this week, Woolrich President
S. Wade Judy said a soft retail market and high inventory levels
would force the company to lay off about 1,500 employees at least
until spring.
   Layoff notices will begin going out this month and those who
will be released should know their fate by the end of November,
said Rod Bailey, the company's vice president of human resources.
   ``We feel badly about this at this time of year, but we really
don't have much choice about it,'' he said.
   Judy's letter said consumer buying habits were shifting away
from Woolrich's basic line of outdoor clothing. He said the company
has developed new lines of clothing for the current season, but
that there were few orders for delivery in 1991.
   ``We don't have ample orders beyond Dec. 10, which is very
unusual and a major reason for the work force curtailment,'' Bailey
said.
   Woolrich has 2,600 employees nationwide at five plants in
Pennsylvania, two in Georgia, two in Colorado and one in Nebraska.
   In the spring, Woolrich placed more than 1,000 workers on a
three-day work week, but reinstated all to a 40-hour week within
two months, Bailey said.

   Soybean futures prices were mixed, wheat futures
gained and corn was lower at the close of a light day of trading
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans futures opened slightly higher amid strong buying and
worry about the U.S. House defeat of the budget agreement and its
possible effects on farming programs. But trading became mixed
after there were no reports of new export business, analysts said.
   ``There was some expected follow-through on Russian business and

research for Refco Inc.
   Corn turned lower for the same reasons, Feltes said. Wheat,

higher on expectations of sales of subsidized government wheat
flour, he said.

<TEXT>
   It's becoming clear just how bad a summer it was
for business and the economy.
   Data reported this past week showed widespread damage from the
slowdown in growth and the shock of the Middle East crisis.
   Among the grim findings:
   - Stock mutual funds lost an average of 15.5 percent during the
third quarter, compared with a gain of nearly 6 percent in the
preceding three months, according to Lipper Analytical Securities
Corp. The quarter was the worst since the fourth quarter of 1987,
which included Black Monday.
   - September was the worst month for American manufacturers since
the end of the 1982 recession, the National Association of
Purchasing Management said.
   - Unemployment increased for the third straight month in
September to 5.7 percent, the highest level since the spring of
1988.
   - Help-wanted advertising dropped in August in another sign of
labor market weakness, according to a business research firm.
   - Sales of new homes fell 1.4 percent in August, and would have
fallen even further if not for some buyers who locked in deals
before the Persian Gulf crisis pressured interest rates higher.
   - Sales of cars and trucks by U.S. automakers dropped 3.7
percent in late September, capping the worst model year since 1983.
Adding insult to injury for American manufacturers, the Japanese
Honda Accord was the best-selling car of the year.

   First, there was a budget agreement, then there wasn't.
   President Bush and congressional leaders presented a budget deal
that promised to cut $500 billion from the federal deficit over
five years. But despite the added support of Federal Reserve chief
Alan Greenspan, who indicated easier credit might follow, the pact
didn't survive the week.
   The House voted it down in the wee hours of Friday morning,
after hearing loud complaints from businesses and consumers. Higher
taxes on gasoline, lower farm subsidies and reduced Medicare
benefits were more than many people could swallow.
   Wall Street, which had lobbied successfully to kill a proposed
tax on securities trades, was disappointed when the deal collapsed
since it revived uncertainty about the prospects for lower interest
rates.

   In such a depressed climate, troubled companies could prove the
best investment.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. said it had raised $700 million to invest
in companies with heavy debts.
   The strategy marked a big change from the days when investment
houses chased takeover targets and helped companies pile up big
debts for mergers and leveraged buyouts.
   The Goldman fund would seek profit in mopping up some of that
mess by helping companies restructure their finances and rise from
the ashes.

<HEAD>JAPAN: Stocks Leap, Then Stumble</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Japanese stocks took their biggest one-day jump in history
Tuesday, pushing a key market index up more than 13 percent.
   The runup was powered by the government's announcement of
measures to prop up the ailing market, which had lost nearly half
its value - or about $2 trillion - over the course of the year.
   The euphoria was short-lived, though. The market resumed its
slide the next two days before rebounding slightly at week's end.
   The measures, which eased limits for buying stock on credit and
shortened hours for trading futures contracts, were aimed at
stimulating trading and reducing volatility.
   Most observers were pessimistic about the chances for turning
the battered market around.

   Dueling lists of the best American cities for business reached
different results.
   Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the big commercial real estate firm, said
the best was Seattle, the Northwest's biggest metropolis. Fortune
magazine countered with Salt Lake City.
   Quality of life figured heavily on both lists. Still, there was
little agreement. Indeed, neither of the list leaders merited so
much as a mention in each other's ranking. Seattle was nowhere to
be found on the Fortune list; Salt Lake was likewise missing from
the C&amp;W survey.

   Stock prices lost ground today in an erratic
session that followed the rejection of a government budget plan.
   Prices dropped sharply at the opening after the overnight news
that the House had defeated the budget proposal worked out last
weekend by President Bush and congressional leaders.
   Analysts said that development dismayed investors who had pinned
their hopes on some tangible signs of progress in the struggle to
narrow the government's chronic deficit.
   But after the initial wave of selling passed, the market
steadied. Brokers said hopes lingered that the White House and
Congress might come up with an alternative budget plan.
   Separately, the Labor Department issued monthly statistics
showing an increase in the unemployment rate and a drop in nonfarm
payroll employment.
   The figures, which came in a bit weaker than expected, were
taken as corroborating evidence that the economy is close to or
already in a recession. Some observers also saw them, however, as
cause for hope that interest rates might soon decline.

<HEAD>Gets Temporary Moratorium on Debt Repayments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polly Peck International PLC on Friday secured a
temporary debt repayment moratorium from lenders, gaining time to
cope with a liquidity crunch, the company said.
   The food and electronics company controlled by Asil Nadir, its
chairman and chief executive, had sought the freeze on repayments
after lenders clamped down on its credit lines.
   The lines of credit were tightened after the Sept. 20 trading
suspension in Polly Peck's stock. The suspension, which is still in
force, caused the liquidity problems, the company said earlier this
week.
   The trading halt stemmed from an inquiry by Britain's Serious
Fraud Office into a possible stock manipulation scheme in Polly
Peck shares.
   The payment moratorium came after bankers for the cash-starved
conglomerate met with the company management on Friday.
   ``It was agreed by the bankers and other lenders . . . that a
temporary standstill would be granted to the company so that the
best way forward may be discussed,'' the company said in a brief
news release late Friday.
   The release added that the discussions will be conducted by a
steering committee of 10 representatives of the lenders and may
lead to a longer standstill period. The panel may wait to conclude
its business until after reviewing a report on Polly Peck being
done by an accounting firm.
   Executives of Polly Peck weren't available to comment on the
exact terms of the standstill arrangement. A company spokesman,
speaking anonymously, said he wasn't authorized to elaborate on the
matter.
   Banking industry sources gave conflicting reports on how long
the moratorium would last. It was expected to run from one week to
a few weeks but not as long as the 90 days Polly Peck had sought.
   Standard Chartered PLC, a major U.K. commercial bank, is leading
the Polly Peck steering committee and will be responsible for
coordinating further talks between the company and its lenders,
according to banking sources who didn't wish to be identified.
   Polly Peck's announcement also suggested that the review being
done by accountants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte would ease
persistent doubts about the company's financial health.
   The report by the British arm of the international accounting
and consulting firm isn't expected to be completed for three
months. But preliminary findings might be available sooner to Polly
Peck's major lenders.
   The company's main creditors had contemplated forcing Polly Peck
into hands of a court-appointed adminstrator while questions over
its financial and fiscal soundness were addressed.
   But banking sources who attended the Friday meeting with Polly
Peck's management said the company made a strong case to maintain
its independence while its financial affairs are sorted out.
   ``There are many, many questions which still have to be
answered,'' said a banker leaving the talks. ``At this point, banks
want to avoid administration,'' said the banker, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   It also emerged Friday that the Bank of England last week
advised Turkey of Polly Peck's urgent need for $190 million.
   The Bank of England, the country's central bank, declined to
comment on its involvement with Polly Peck and the Turkish
government, which has indicated it is considering offering some
form of assistance to the company and its Turkish chairman.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds totaled a

   Boosting the total were sales of $544 million in September, a 3

   At the same time, redemptions in fiscal 1990 totaled $7.54

<HEAD>Wall Street Looks For A Turning Point</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the midst of a bear market on Wall Street,
some analysts are keeping busy searching out the seeds of future
opportunities.
   Prolonged declines in stock prices are naturally painful and
dispiriting to investors, these observers acknowledge. But they add
that many of the best opportunities to buy stocks for handsome
returns have come in periods of financial travail.
   ``There is no question that the market is currently weak,'' says
George Putnam III in the current issue of his investment advisory
publication The Turnaround Letter.
   ``The word we hear most often to describe market conditions
these days is `ugly.' Investors are very skittish, and any bad news
will send a stock plummeting.
   ``But we view the current market as an attractive buying
opportunity. Good companies in all categories have been hammered
over the last two months, and they will recover sharply when
investors regain some confidence in the market.
   ``It may not happen this month, or even this year, but it will
happen.''
   Or as Barton Biggs at the investment banking firm of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. puts it, ``The bear is aging. In the U.S., I think we
are somewhere in the second half of a cyclical bear market, in
which the averages normally decline in the range of 20 percent to
30 percent.
   ``The bad news is no secret anymore. Everyone knows most of the
bear story.
   ``The news doesn't have to become good for stocks to stop going
down - just that it is less bad than what has already been
discounted in prices.
   ``The scare scenarios always seem more credible when the markets
are falling, but you have to be careful not to get more bearish as
prices decline. Instead, you logically should become more bullish
because you can buy quality goods cheaper.
   ``I think we have further to go in this bear market, but as
prices go down I want to begin averaging in.''
   Observers like Putnam and Biggs readily concede how difficult it
is to call a market ``bottom.''
   Indeed, some analysts contend that stocks are likely to keep
sliding as long as it takes to discourage just about all the
``bargain hunters'' and self-proclaimed patient optimists.
   ``This global bear market should still be respected and treated
with great caution,'' says Stan Weinstein, publisher of the
Professional Tape Reader advisory in Hollywood, Fla.
   In the past week the market made some fitful efforts to rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,510.64,
up 58.16 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.85 to
170.70; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 12.85 to 347.36, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index lost 1.24 to 306.48.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 164.96 million shares a day,
against 171.48 million the week before.
   Most analysts believe stock prices at recent levels have already
taken into account a moderate, relatively short recession. Their
main worry is that confidence among investors will suffer some
further blows, raising the prospect of a deeper and longer slump.
   ``In every bear phase there has been what seemed to be a
plausible doomsday scenario that terrorized investors,'' Biggs
said. ``In retrospect most of them seem far-fetched, but they sure
scared me at the time.
   ``If the economic apocalypse does really come this time, it
won't happen overnight, and my guess is that the central banks will
try to inflate their way out.
   ``We are not going through the end of the world, just the end of
the euphoria. Some gloomy, rainy day, for no clearly discernible
reason, stocks will stop declining.''

<HEAD>Stocks, Bonds Tumble, Rebound After Budget Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failed federal budget accord slammed stock
and bond prices Friday but the markets recovered nearly all the
lost ground, partly on President Bush's tough stance against
Congress.
   The key Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped nearly
70 points after the opening bell before steadying to close the day
down 6.19 points at 2,510.64.
   In a lengthy night session, a rebellious House early Friday
overwhelmingly defeated the $500-billion compromise package of tax
increases and spending cuts sought by Bush and congressional
leaders.
   Wall Street professionals had hoped for a budget accord to help
reduce the amount of borrowing needed to pay the federal deficit
and spur the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates to stimulate
economic activity. Lower interest rates tend to make stocks and
bonds more valuable.
   In an unstable market already whipped by rising oil prices and
the turmoil in the Persian Gulf, the congressional rejection
initially appeared to quash those possibilities.
   ``It's more uncertainty,'' said Dan Williams, head of equity
trading with Dillon, Read &amp; Co. ``With the Middle East now, all you
need is another guy throwing the hat in the ring.''
   The opening plunge triggered a New York Stock Exchange restraint
on computerized selling strategies aimed at helping stabilize the
market, an outgrowth of the stock market crash nearly three years
ago.
   But stocks and bonds staged a gradual recovery during the day as
some traders believed the sell-off was too great and that budget
negotiators would resolve their differences.
   Additionally, a White House statement that Bush would refuse to
sign emergency financing legislation to keep the government
operating heartened some traders looking for strong leadership in
Washington.
   Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J., said the markets believe Congress
will not allow a long-term government shutdown ``and therefor they
will come to vote for the accord, and probably soon.''
   Stock and bond prices also received a boost when Britain dropped
a key interest rate and announced that the pound will enter
Europe's exchange rate mechanism, effective Monday. Those moves
incited a rally in British stocks and the buying mood spilled over
to Wall Street.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy and
interest rates, the key 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged after
falling close to $6 per $1,000 in face amount earlier in the day.
Its yield finished at 8.78 percent.
   Oil contracts traded in the futures market, which determines
prices, rose $1.06 to around $37.99 a barrel after easing slightly
on Thursday.
   A report from the Labor Department this morning showing
unemployment in September rose slightly was overshadowed by the
budget vote and had little effect on the markets, strategists said.

   News of the pound's entry into Europe's exchange

   The late news moved the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share

   The London market closed an hour later than normal to take
account of the increase in trading volume.
   ``Buying orders are coming out of our ears,'' one trader said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 43 points at
1,644.3. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 28.98 points to

   Stock prices fell Friday, but the market managed
to minimize the damage from an early selloff that followed the
rejection of a government budget plan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.19 to
2,510.64, reducing its gain for the week to 58.16 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
598 up, 893 down and 464 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled about 60 points at the
outset. Such a selloff had been widely predicted following the
overnight word that the House had defeated the budget proposal
worked out last weekend by President Bush and congressional
leaders.
   Analysts said the news dismayed investors who had pinned their
hopes on some tangible signs of progress in the struggle to narrow

   The figures, which came in a bit weaker than expected, were
taken as corroborating evidence that the economy is close to or
already in a recession. Some observers also saw them, however, as
cause for hope that interest rates might soon decline.
   British stocks chalked up some of the day's most notable gains,
responding to lower interest rates in London and plans for
inclusion of the pound in the European Monetary System.
   Barclays climbed 2} to 28}; British Telecom 4&lsqb; to 55&lsqb;; Glaxo

   Among U.S. issues, the battered bank stocks rallied a bit. Chase

   By contrast, Travelers Corp. fell 4&rsqb; to 16&rsqb;. The company reduced
its dividend, and said an addition to its reserves for mortgage and
real estate investments would result in a $500 million
third-quarter loss.

consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 186.43 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   ``That whiff of peace that the market smelled is wearing off,''
said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil went up $1.06 to $37.99 per barrel for
November delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   For the week, crude fell $1.52 per barrel, unable to erase sharp
losses from Monday and Tuesday, when prices plummeted a total of
more than $5 on what were construed as peaceful overtures from Iraq
and the United States.
   On Friday, oil traders were responding mostly to news reports
that Iraq would not make any conciliatory statements to the United
Nations in a much-awaited speech that had been canceled twice
during the week.
   An advance copy of Iraq's statement showed Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz was accusing the United States and its allies of
bringing ``the entire world to the brink of a devastating war'' in
a plot to gain control of Persian Gulf oil.
   America and other nations have assembled a military force in the
Gulf in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August.
   Prices were boosted somewhat during late trading on news Friday
that a Jordanian clergyman and government official had urged his
countrymen to retaliate against the U.S. troops, possibly through
terrorist acts, Hittle said.
   Crude oil's rise Friday was mostly steady, and it lifted futures
for refined products.
   Home heating oil went up 2.78 cents to $1.027 per gallon for
November delivery, while unleaded gasoline was up 1.78 cents to
92.64 cents per gallon for November delivery.
   Later contract months were higher for crude, heating oil and
gasoline.
   For the week, heating oil went down 3.2 cents per gallon, while
gasoline dropped 6.07 cents per gallon.
   Natural gas rose 3.7 cents to $1.935 per 1,000 cubic feet for
November contracts on Friday, finishing the week unchanged. Most
later contract months for natural gas were higher Friday.

   Ted Arison, one of the nation's richest men,
announced Friday he is quitting as chairman of Carnival Cruise
Lines effective immediately.
   Arison, 66, will remain on the board of directors and act as a
consultant. His son Micky, 41, who has served as president and
chief executive officer since 1979, will take his place as
chairman.
   ``The reality is that there won't be that much difference in my

   Arison was listed by Forbes magazine a year ago as the nation's
third-richest man with a fortune valued at $2.86 billion.
   But he has suffered recent reverses, including the Aug. 31
seizure of Ensign Bank, his $1.9 billion New York thrift taken over

   Ensign had unsuccessfully attempted a merger wih the
now-defunct CenTrust Bank in January, but regulators vetoed the
deal and later liquidated the Miami thrift.

   MCI long-distance customers in the

afternoon when a switch failed, the company said.
   The 45-minute outage affected perhaps 20 percent of the incoming

   The problem was confined to the local area and service was

   Houser said the failure in the switch was ``comparable to a
circuit breaker going out.'' The switch was one of five that MCI
has in the Washington area and may have caused temporary backups
for calls going through the other four switches, he said.
   Houser would not disclose the number of customers MCI has in the

   Washington-based MCI is the nation's second-largest

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Continue Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork belly futures prices aimed for near-record prices Friday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a perceived shortage on the
market had traders fearing supplies would run ou before next
summer.
   Frozen pork bellies settled .37 cent to the trading limit of 2
cents higher with the contract for delivery in February at 66.45
cents a pound.
   On other commodity markets, livestock futures were mixed;
soybeans were mixed, wheat gained and corn was lower; precious
metals were mixed; and energy futures prices rose.
   Pork bellies futures continued to rise on last week's
hogs-and-pigs report from the Agriculture Department that estimated
the number of pigs born during the summer was 2 percent lower than
had been expected.
   ``Pork bellies prices have been going absolutely crazy,'' said
Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill. ``There's going to be a tight fit on cattle and pork
supplies.''
   Pork and cattle futures prices already had been driven higher on
indications the markets were low. Frozen pork bellies supplies
reportedly are virtually depleted.
   Concern that U.S. packing plants might be shut down if a budget
agreement is not reached by next week also drove prices higher,
Morgan said.
   ``We may end up with days where there is no meat in the grocery
stores, and that's certainly going to affect prices,'' he said.
   In livestock trading on the Merc, live cattle futures settled
.30 cent lower to .23 cent higher with October at 79.77 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
October at 87.82; and hogs were .08 cent lower to .45 cent higher
with October at 57.17 cents a pound.
   Soybean and wheat futures prices were mostly lower, and corn was
mixed at the close of a light day of trading on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   Soybeans futures opened slightly higher amid strong buying and
worry about the U.S. House defeat of the budget agreement and its
possible effects on farming programs. But trading became mixed
after there were no reports of new export business, analysts said.
   ``There was some expected follow-through on Russian business and
pre-hedging in advance of what appears to be a good harvest weekend
in the Midwest,'' said Rich Feltes, director of commodities
research for Refco Inc.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to } cent lower with December at
$2.73} a bushel; corn futures were 2{ cents lower to \ cent higher
with December at $2.28} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 1{ cents
lower with December at $1.21{ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents
lower to \ higher with November at $6.17 a bushel.
   Energy futures climbed higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on technical buying. Little news from the Persian Gulf
limited advances.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 21 cents to $1.06 higher
with November at $37.99 a barrel; heating oil settled .35 cent to
2.78 cents higher with November at $1.027 a gallon; unleaded
gasoline settled .20 cent to 1.78 cents higher with November at
92.64 cents a gallon.
   Gold followed the energy markets and silver fell in light
trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.30 higher with October at $393.60 a
troy ounce. Silver settled .2 cent to .1 cent lower with October at
$4.667 an ounce.

   A surging British pound dominated foreign
exchange trading Friday as dealers scrambled to buy sterling on
word it would be formally linked to other major European
currencies.
   The dollar rose against its major foreign counterparts except
the pound and the Japanese yen, rebounding from a selloff Thursday
incited by expectations of lower U.S. interest rates.
   The dollar buying came mostly as a byproduct of cross trading
between sterling and the German mark.
   Gold prices gained modestly in domestic trading but moved mostly
lower overseas.
   Market participants in the United States said the dollar began
on a weak note due to news of another deterioration in the
country's job market.
   The Labor Department reported an increase in the unemployment
rate for the third straight month and a decline in nonfarm
payrolls. The jobless rate rose to 5.7 percent in September from
August's 5.6 percent.
   The House's rejection of a $500 billion deficit-cutting
compromise also was a negative for the dollar because it cast doubt
on the government's ability to solve the chronic deficit problem.
   Andrew Busch, a currency dealer at Harris Trust in Chicago, said
attention turned to sterling around midmorning in the United States
when the British government announced the pound would join Europe's
Exchange Rate Mechanism.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said starting Monday the
pound will join the mechanism that presently links nine of the
currencies of the 12-nation European Community.
   The move, which is expected to help Britain fight inflation and
improve that country's economic prospects, will be coupled with a 1
percentage point cut in key British interest rates to 14 percent.
   The pound jumped to $1.9455 from $1.9185 before the announcement
in London, and was more than three cents higher than its level of
$1.9115 late Thursday.
   Against Europe's pivotal currency, the German mark, the pound
finished at 2.9933 marks, up from 2.9322 late Thursday. Major said
the pound will enter the ERM at 2.95 marks and be allowed to
fluctuate by six percent either way.
   The pound also bounded ahead in New York. It took $1.9525 to buy
a pound late in the session, more costly than $1.9145 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late quotes, included: 1.5475 German marks, up from 1.5340; 1.2940
Swiss francs, up from 1.2800; 5.1850 French francs, up from 5.1375;
1,160.25 Italian lire, up from 1,149.00; and 1.1524 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.14865.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates on
Thursday, were: 1.5372 German marks, up from 1.5340; 1.2847 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2760; 5.1473 French francs, up from 5.1400;
1.7340 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7300; 1,150.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,150.00; and 1.1500 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1485.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 133.72 Japanese
yen from 135.90 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, the
dollar fell to 132.50 yen. The dollar closed at 132.20 yen in New
York, down from 133.83 yen late Thursday.
   Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
bullion for October delivery settled at $393.60 a troy ounce, up
$1.30 from Thursday. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a bid for
gold of $394 an ounce, 80 cents higher than Thursday's 4 p.m. EDT
bid.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid of $394.35 a troy ounce from
$396.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $394.40 from $396.25 late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold rose $3.47 to close at a bid of $391.95.
   Silver prices edged down. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery settled at $4.667 a troy ounce, down from $4.668
on Thursday. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.69 a troy
ounce from $4.71 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Bonds Recover After Sell-Off Pegged to Budget Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished little changed Friday after
a volatile session in which failure to reach a federal budget
accord overshadowed another rise in unemployment.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended the day largely
unchanged, recovering from a sharp decline earlier in the day that
pushed prices down about $6 per $1,000 face amount. The bond's
yield dipped to 8.78 percent from 8.79 percent late Thursday.
   The House voted 254-179 early Friday to reject President Bush's
plan aimed at cutting $500 billion from the federal budget deficit.
   Bond traders said the rejection made it unlikely the Federal
Reserve would take quick action to lower interest rates to spur the
slumping economy, which would boost the value of fixed-income
instruments such as bonds.
   The bond market for weeks has awaited a Fed easing and pinned
its hopes to the budget deal.
   ``The market is realizing that without any federal budget
accord, the Fed probably won't ease,'' said Kevin Flanagan, a money
market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The budget collapse took precedence over the Labor Department's
report that unemployment rose to 5.7 percent in September, another
sign of weakening. But analysts said the report had some
inflationary signals, which dulled its impact on bonds.
   ``The significance of the report was severely diminished because
of the knowledge that the Fed will not respond to any weak
(economic) data until there is a budget-cutting accord,'' said Ward
McCarthy of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
   Treasury bills dropped sharply at the market's opening, with the
discount yields on three-month and one-year bills dropping below 7
percent for a short time for the first time since August 1988. All
maturities began rebounding around midmorning.
   Economists attributed some of the gain to President Bush's
stance refusing to sign emergency legislation to keep the
government operating. That was seen as an attempt by the White
House to press for a quick resolution to the budget impasse.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of
short-term, intermediate and long-term government issues all ranged
from unchanged to up 1-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.68 to 1155.31.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.25 percent as the
discount tumbled 9 basis points to 7.03 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.42 percent as the discount dropped was
down 6 basis points to 7.07 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell
to 7.49 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points to 7.01
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7 15-16 percent, down from
8 3-16 percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 88 23-32, down 1-16 point. The
average yield to maturity rose to 7.77 percent from 7.76 percent
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Sale of UAL Stock Rights Seen As Sign Wolf Opposes Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. employees say Chairman Stephen Wolf
will look hypocritical if he urges the company's board to reject a
buyout offer, now that he's sold some of his UAL stock rights for
less than the buyout bid.
   The United Airlines labor unions leading the buyout group
contend Wolf has been lobbying the board not to accept any buyout
offer less than $201 a share, or about $4.4 billion.
   The employees said Friday that Wolf's sale of stock rights
indicates his lack of faith - if not downright opposition - to the
employee buyout.
   But they said the news could help their effort because Wolf will
look hypocritical if he urges UAL's board to reject an offer that's
higher than the reported $150 sale price for his stock rights.
   Meanwhile, the buyout group awaited word on whether it has
enough bank financing to approach the board next week with a bid
expected to value UAL at $165 to $175 a share, or $3.6 billion to
$3.8 billion.
   One person familiar with the situation said the unions expected
to continue receiving loan commitments through the weekend. The
group needs to line up financing by Tuesday, when UAL's board is
expected to meet.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Wolf exercised
200,000 of his 208,333 stock appreciation rights last spring when
UAL's stock was selling at about $150 a share. Wolf made a $14
million profit on the deal, the newspaper said.
   The Journal also said UAL's chief financial officer, John Pope,
sold 50,000 of his 60,000 rights at the same time, earning $4.2
million.
   UAL stock closed down $2.62{ at $102.75 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Stock appreciation rights, when exercised, enable their owners
to receive in cash the amount a stock has increased over the
exercise price. The Journal said Wolf's rights had an average
exercise price of $83.31 and Pope's exercise prices averaged $69.
   The company confirmed the executives had sold part of their
stock rights in light of the unions' intent to replace them with
their own senior management team if the buyout bid succeeds.
   Wolf was said to be worried the unions would nullify the rights
if they succeeded in buying the company.
   Airline analyst Stephen Dexter of Kemper Financial Services Inc.
said Wolf apparently sold his stock rights because he saw the
employee buyout offer, which was then for $201 a share, as
``totally unreasonable, or at least he did not believe it was
do-able.
   ``From what I can tell, he made a smart business decision,''
Dexter said, noting that UAL's stock fell as low as $87.25 a share
during the summer.
   Some observers in the unions' camp said Wolf's actions confirmed
that he opposes the employee buyout, despite his public statements
to the contrary.
   ``We're offering the shareholders more (than $150 a share). How
can Wolf tell the board our offer isn't enough?'' said Frederick
Dubinsky, chairman of the United pilots union.
   The four large U.S. banks that are trying the arrange a loan for
the buyout continued to receive commitments Friday from smaller
banks, a source told The Associated Press.
   The banks likely will decide by Monday whether to finance the
deal, the source said.

<HEAD>Travelers Corp. Adds to Reserves; Third-Quarter Loss Put at $500
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. said Friday it is
adding $650 million to its reserves to cover expected real estate
losses, a move that will result in a third-quarter net loss of $500
million.
   The Hartford-based insurance company will also reduce its
quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 40 cents per share.
   Edward H. Budd, Travelers chairman and chief executive officer,
said reserves were boosted to cover expected losses in the
company's mortgage loan and real estate investments.
   He blamed the sharp decline in the commercial real estate
market.
   ``Following an intensive review of our mortgage loans and real
estate holdings, we determined it appropriate to increase reserves
to provide for real estate losses which we expect to emerge over a
number of years,'' Budd said.
   The company said this was the first major addition to reserves
since June 1988, when Travelers added $415 million to cover
anticipated real estate losses. The latest increase boosts reserves
to $1.15 billion at quarter's end.
   Travelers said it will post a net loss of $500 million in the
quarter, compared with net income of $94 million for the same
period last year. The company also will have a net loss for the
year, Budd said.
   He said the one-third reduction in the quarterly dividend, to
save $100 million by the end of 1991, will allow the company to
retain more earnings to support growth.
   Despite its losses in the real estate market, the company said
its main businesses continue to be strong.
   Budd said the company has made progress in restructuring its
insurance operations, generating cost improvements of nearly $200
million in the past two years. He said the company wrote a record
$1.3 billion in new business in the managed care and employee
benefits area in 1989.
   The company expects operating profits in the third quarter to
surpass 1989 levels of $63 million, and operating income for 1990
to rise by about 25 percent above last year.
   Travelers stock fell sharply on the announcement, closing down
$4.37{ on the New York Stock Exchange to $16.37{ a share.
   Two top rating agencies also acted negatively. Both Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Friday they had
lowered their ratings on Travelers' debt because of continuing
problems in the commercial mortgage and real estate markets.
   Moody's said the addition to reserves, combined with previous
writedowns of mortgage assets, would give the company a cushion to
absorb any increases in non-performing assets over the next few
years.
   ``The company's decision to reduce its common stockholder
dividend, and its conservative financial leverage, will provide the
company with greater financial flexibility, enabling it to respond
to this worsening environment,'' Moody's said.
   About $1 billion of long-term debt was affected by the Moody's
downgrade. Standard &amp; Poor's actions affected about $649 million in
debt.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Order Against Payments by Asbestos Trust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday again extended a freeze
on payments to asbestos disease victims by the Manville trust fund
pending completion of a court-ordered reorganization.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said the month-long
extension was needed to finalize an agreement on a restructuring in
which Manville Corp. would inject up to $520 million over seven
years to reverse a cash shortfall.
   The shortage has jeopardized compensation payments to tens of
thousands of victims. The agreement to refinance the trust was
announced last month. The payments by Manville would begin late
next year.
   It was the third month-long extension by Weinstein on the
payments freeze, which applies to all claims or court judgments
made since the first order in August or until the new Nov. 6
expiration date.
   The trust was created in 1988 as part of Manville's bankruptcy
court reorganization, which was forced by mounting liability for
lung cancer and other serious and fatal diseases caused by
asbestos.
   Under the freeze, the trust is permitted to make payments for
hardship claims and emergency health needs, as well as operating
expenses, legal fees of trust attorneys and fees to a court adviser
overseeing the restructuring.
   The trust to date has settled close to 24,000 claims for more
than $1 billion from people made sick by inhaling asbestos fibers,
mostly during shipbuilding and other construction.
   The trust faces 130,000 more claims it can't meet. Weinstein
ordered the reorganization after the trust said it was out of money
to pay new claims it said would not be met until well into the 21st
century.
   The reorganization is designed to speed payments and alter the
compensation scheme so that claims are processed based on victims'
health and financial need rather than when they file a claim.

   America's unemployment rate worsened for the
third straight month in September, the government said.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilian jobless
rate rose to 5.7 percent last month.
   Coupled with unemployment rises in July and August, marked the
first time since the 1981-82 recession that the jobless rate has
increased three months in a row, the government said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The failed federal budget accord slammed stock
and bond prices but the markets recovered nearly all the lost
ground, partly on President Bush's tough stance against Congress.
   In a lengthy night session, a rebellious House early Friday
overwhelmingly defeated the $500-billion compromise package of tax
increases and spending cuts sought by Bush and congressional
leaders.
   Wall Street professionals had hoped for a budget accord to help
reduce the amount of borrowing needed to pay the federal deficit
and spur the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates.

Continental Corp. junk bonds sold through Lincoln branches.
   Keating, who has been unable to post $5 million bail, was then

   The company said it was the first major addition to reserves
since June 1988, when Travelers added $415 million to cover
anticipated real estate losses. The latest increase boosts reserves
to $1.15 billion at quarter's end.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) - Trans World Airlines Inc. sent layoff notices
to 430 employees to cut its losses further in an industry hit hard
by rising fuel prices and the slumping economy.
   A TWA spokesman said Frida that more layoffs, and possibly
flight reductions, could come later. TWA, which has its hub in St.
Louis, has about 33,000 employees worldwide.
   The spokesman said the layoffs were related to higher jet fuel
prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. USAir Group Inc., Pan
Am Corp. and Midway Airlines Inc. also have announced layoffs.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve policy-makers decided two
weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to keep interest rates
unchanged but to permit lower rates if economic conditions
warranted, newly released records show.
   Short-term interest rates, which the Fed has used for two years
in combatting inflation, did not change after the Aug. 21 meeting
of the Federal Open Market Committee. They have remained at 8
percent since mid-summer. The Fed records were released Friday.

   LONDON (AP) - Dropping long-standing resistance, the government
said it will link the pound to Europe's exchange rate mechanism, a
move expected to help Britain's fight against inflation.
   The move Friday symbolized British willingness to participate in
European integration, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher stressed
her continued opposition to creating a single European bank and a
single currency.

   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) - The executive who oversaw the manufacture
of the Hubble Space Telescope has resigned from Hughes Danbury
Optical Systems Inc., a month after the company was blamed for a
flaw that blurred the scope's view.
   John D. Rehnberg, 53, operations manager of the space science
division, said his decision to resign this week was
``unequivocally'' his own.
   He oversaw the manufacturing of the Hubble mirror, which
contained a flaw that has caused the $1.5 billion telescope to
deliver blurry pictures to earth.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The decline of American banks compared with
their foreign competitors threatens to harm an already weak U.S.
economy and diminish the nation's world influence, a congressional
report concludes.
   A House Banking Committee task force, chaired by Rep. John J.
LaFalce, D-N.Y., strongly suggested that the Depression-era
constraints barring banks from expanding into new services such as
securities underwriting and insurance must fall if U.S. banks are
to regain their edge.

damage from an early sell-off that followed the rejection of a
government budget plan. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped
6.19 to 2,510.64, reducing its gain for the week to 58.16 points.
   The dollar rose against most major currencies. Gold gained
modestly.
   Bonds were little changed.
   Pork belly futures prices aimed for near-record prices;
livestock futures and soybeans were mixed; wheat gained and corn
was lower; and energy futures rose.
