   In the land where high school football is
as important as oil, cattle and chili, a traditional cross-town
rivalry is hotter than ever after a stinging expose, a tattling
coach, a lawsuit and death threats.
   Police patrols were more than doubled for the game between state
powerhouse Permian High School and longtime rival Odessa High
School on Friday night and city leaders urged rabid fans to keep
their cool.
   ``There was a lot of concern that, because of anger, there could
be vandalism, even violence, if we did not pull together as a
community,'' Mayor Lorraine Bonner said.
   Permian won 24-6 and there were no incidents reported
immediately after the game. Players from both teams hugged each
other at midfield after the game as 20,000 fans stood in ovation.
   Before the game, a student read a prayer and the schools' bands
played ``America the Beautiful'' together.
   Contributing to the pre-game tension was action by Odessa
football coach Jerry Taylor. He ended Permian's chances of
defendingits state title when he told University Interscholastic
League officials he saw the Permian team holding an organized
practice before the Aug. 20 starting date.
   Taylor's accusation resulted in Permian's ban from the 1990
playoffs and several anonymous death threats against Taylor.
   Attorneys for the Permian football coaching staff filed a
lawsuit against the league Friday in hopes of reversing the
sanctions, which included a two-game suspension for Coach Tam
Hollingshead and a year of probation for the team.
   The Permian Panthers, widely known as ``Mojo,'' have won five
state titles and finished second four times.
   Permian fans also were angered by H.G. Bissinger's book,
``Friday Night Lights.'' It depicts a city where racism is rampant,
football gets more attention than English class and school district
lines are drawn to guarantee the best athletes play for Permian.
   Book-signing appearances by Bissinger in this west Texas city of
108,000 were canceled last week by bookstore owners after they
received threats on the Pulitzer Prize-winning author's life.
   Some residents claimed Bissinger duped them into cooperating
with assurances he was writing a positive account of local prep
football, along the lines of ``Hoosiers,'' a heroic tale of an
Indiana high school basketball team.
   To keep tensions at a low boil, Odessa High canceled its yearly
mock funeral procession of Permian's mascot.
   ``This rivalry was bad enough before all the sanctions came
down,'' said Candy Dennis, a Permian graduate who works at Odessa
High. ``They canceled the panther funeral because they don't want
any more trouble between the two schools.''
   The mayor and 14 students from both schools on Wednesday
videotaped a public service message they hoped will reduce
animosity.
   ``With this appeal ... we are asking that everyone who goes to
the game Friday night show the real stuff that Odessa is made of,''
Ms. Bonner said. ``Let's show everyone watching, and that's going
to be a lot of people, that Odessa has a lot of strengths, too.''
   Odessa High, which has not beaten Permian since 1964, was given
its best chance in many years to beat Permian this year. The game
at Odessa's 20,000-seat Ratliff Stadium has been sold out for days.
   The city's police department assigned about 50 officers to the
game, ``where normally we would have no more than 20,'' said Sgt.
Jim McKown.
   ``Tensions run high for this game even when there isn't all the
added conflict, so there is a real potential for trouble.''

<NOTE>EDs: Inserts new 5th graf, The negotiators, to update with talks
over for evening</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Congress and the White House
opened a final-weekend search on Friday for tax increases and
spending cuts acceptable to enough lawmakers to avert disruption of
major government services on Monday.
   By most accounts, the negotiators were hung up over two
perennially tough issues: Whether and how to tamper with Social
Security benefits and whether and how to reuce taxes on capital
gains.
   They were working through the Yom Kippur holiday on Saturday,
and the House and Senate scheduled sessions Sunday to deal with the
emergency.
   Differences were said to be narrowing but nobody was about to
guarantee agreement before the new budget year begins Monday.
``There are some remaining issues that are very difficult that
remain to be resolved,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   The negotiators quit for the day just before midnight. ``Lots of
issues are left,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole told
reporters. ``I'm optimistic,''
   Members of both parties agreed it will be no easy job getting
support among rank-and-file lawmakers for whatever agreement is
reached by the leaders.
   ``Obviously, everybody wants something to pass but very few
people want to vote for it,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said after
briefing other GOP senators on what negotiators are doing. ``We've
got a lot of heavy lifting to do'' to get any agreement enacted
into law, he said.
   ``The best news we could get would be that the negotiators had
reached an agreement,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``But the
big question is whether it can pass Congress.''
   Delaying cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits or
increasing the portion of benefits subject to tax - both options
are being considered - could weaken support for the package,
especially among Democrats.
   On the other hand, if Republicans are unhappy with the
capital-gains provision or whatever offsetting tax increase on the
wealthy is proposed to pay for it, they might walk away from the
whole package.
   Sources in both parties said a recent proposal to exclude from
taxation any capital gain - profit from the sale of an investment -
caused solely by inflation apparently was finding little favor
among negotiators.
   So, Republicans and Democrats exchanged new capital-gains
proposals on Friday.
   Democrats proposed to exclude from taxation 30 percent of
capital gains. In turn, the current maximum 28 percent income-tax
rate on the wealthiest Americans would be raised to 32 percent.
Republicans pressed instead for excluding 40 percent of capital
gains while raising the maximum income-tax rate on the wealthy to
31 percent.
   Capital gains are taxed at the same rates as apply to wages and
other income. President Bush is demanding that they be given
preferential treatment as a spur to investment.
   Democrats, noting nearly 80 percent of such a cut would go to
those with incomes over $100,000, are insisting that any
capital-gains reduction be offset by raising other taxes on
high-income Americans.
   Unless Congress and Bush can agree before Monday on a
deficit-reduction package, $85 billion worth of arbitrary spending
cuts will be triggered, affecting hundreds of programs though
sparing others, including Social Security benefits and military
pay. More than 1 million federal workers have been told to expect
furloughs.
   Although Bush raised the specter of Social Security checks being
delayed, the Social Security Administration says there is no chance
of that happening immediately.
   October Social Security checks already have been handed over to
Post Offices and should be delivered by Wednesday, said Social
Security spokesman Campbell Gardett.
   The deficit crisis is heightened by the fact that Congress has
not enacted any of the 13 annual appropriations bills. Although
Congress is planning to pass stopgap legislation continuing
spending authority until Oct. 20, Bush has said he will veto the
measure because it also would postpone the across-the-board
spending cuts.
   Democrats, who control the House, devised a fallback plan in
case the four-month-old deficit negotiators fail to produce results
by Sunday. Over opposition of Republicans, the committee cleared
the way for House action on an alternative budget reflecting
Democratic positions.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., said that fallback, which envisions
removing the threat of the $85 billion worth of automatic cuts,
would encourage Democrats to ``bob and weave and quote Jefferson
and come to no conclusion.''
   Negotiators are working on a package that would cut the deficit
$50 billion during the 12 months that begin Monday and an
additional $450 billion in the following four years.
   Any agreement is expected to include higher taxes on alcoholic
beverages, gasoline, cigarettes, airline tickets and such luxuries
as high-priced cars and electronic equipment.
   Tentative agreement also has been reached on Medicare cuts
totaling $60 billion over five years, federal workers' retirement
benefits, farm support payments and major reductions in the defense
budget.

<HEAD>Magazine: Pricey Marcos Collection Not Worth the Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-six paintings seized from Imelda and
Ferdinand Marcos are not worth the multimillion dollar price tag
placed on them for auction, an arts magazine says.
   Experts quoted in the October issue of ARTNews said the artwork
is not worth the $8.6 million to $12.5 million Christies auction
house estimated they will bring at a January auction.
   Manhattan conservator Marco Grassi told the magazine that
galleries sold Mrs. Marcos ``inferior art at superior prices.''
   Ian Kennedy, vice president of Christies' Old Master paintings
department, stood by the estimates.
   ``Of course anybody can disagree with estimates, but I am
perfectly satisfied,'' he said. ``You can tell it's not garbage. A
lot of these pictures have been published.''
   The 76 paintings were seized by the Philippine government after
Marcos was ousted and the couple fled to Hawaii in 1986. Marcos
died last year.
   Mrs. Marcos was acquitted in July of fraud charges. Prosecutors
had contended she helped her husband loot their country's treasury
of more than $220 million and spent elaborately on art and other
luxuries.
   Among the paintings scheduled for auction at Christies is one of
the Madonna and child for which Mrs. Marcos paid $700,000. She was
reportedly told that it was by the Renaissance master Fra Filippo
Lippi, but ARTNews said it was really done by Zenobi Machiavelli, a
lesser-known artist.
   Christies' estimate for the painting was $40,000 to $60,000.
   ARTNews said the most valuable artworks Mrs. Marcos owned are
missing, including works by Monet, Renoir, Degas, Gauguin, Cezanne,
van Gogh, Picasso, Chagall and Magritte.

   Doctors in Shanghai have performed what is
believed to be the first sex-change operation in China, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Xinhua reported Friday that Qin Huirong wanted to become a woman
and began mutilating himself, twice cutting his genitalia.
   Without the sex-change operation, Qin might have died, said He
Qinglian, the doctor who performed the operations.
   The 27-year-old graduate of Shanghai's prestigious Fudan
University underwent two operations in July and August at
Shanghai's Changzheng Hospital.
   Qin's father, a farmer, was so angry that he broke off all
relations between them, the report said.Qin planned to start a new
life elsewhere.
   ``I wish to set up a family and look for a gentleman with a
background in higher education as my husband,'' Qin was quoted as
saying.
   The sex-change operations cost about $200, the news agency said.

   China and the European Community have
opened talks on restoring diplomatic relations, which were severed
after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in
June 1989.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis, current head of the
12-nation European Community, announced the development Friday
after meeting with China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen.
   De Michelis indicated the move was linked to China's cooperation
with the U.N. economic embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   ``China's foreign minister has repeated to us that China will
participate fully in the international effort, the international
political solidarity for the application of the United Nations
resolution,'' he said.
   De Michelis said that when the EC Council of Ministers meets in
October, ``I will recommend to my colleagues to take the decision
to renormalize relations with China.''

   Freddie Lo and Susanna Mok finally have their
wedding portrait - taken underwater in a swimming pool.
   The couple was married last month but city officials scuttled
their plans to have their portrait taken in a municipal pool
because the couple failed to apply for permission.
   Undaunted by the red tape and the loss of $3,800 organizing the
picture session, Lo re-applied for permission, spent $5,000 more
and the couple took the plunge Thursday.
   Lo, a foreign exchange manager and former diving coach, wore a
tuxedo and his bride a white wedding gown. Both wore goggles and
she had a bouquet of flowers.
   The bottom of the pool was carpeted with gauze and a poolside
jet-sprayer created a wall of bubbles in the water.
   His bride spent six months taking swimming lessons to prepare
for the photo session.

<HEAD>Iraqi Atrocities in Kuwait May Spur Military Action, Bush Aide
Says</HEAD>

   Iraqi atrocities in occupied Kuwait could
prompt the United States to return to the United Nations to seek
tougher sanctions against Saddam Hussein, possibly even military
action, the White House says.
   On Friday, Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jabir al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
gave President Bush a harrowing account of what the president
called a ``population assaulted, incarcerated, intimidated and even
murdered.''
   The narrative included tales of babies being removed from
incubators and critically ill patients being taken off life-support
systems so that the hospital machinery could be sent back to Iraq,
said national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``It was a pretty devastating account, especially in the face of
Saddam Hussein saying he is the defender of the Arabs against the
outside,'' Scowcroft said.
   As a result of these reports and other accounts of violence and
pillaging, Bush is reviewing the possibility of seeking additional
United Nations action beyond the existing trade embargo and naval
and air blockades, Scowcroft said.
   The White House official also mentioned Iraqi threats to cut off
food supplies to Westerners trapped inside Kuwait and Iraq after
the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``The whole element of what the Iraqis are doing inside Kuwait
to a whole people could conceivably be the subject of another U.N.
action,'' Scowcroft said.
   Asked if the United States might seek a resolution that
specifically sought military action to force Iraq out of Kuwait,
Scowcroft said, ``That's one of those things which is
conceivable.''
   Meanwhile, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said he believes the administration ``is
looking more favorably on an early war option.''
   Aspin told reporters he based this assessment on four factors:
The diminishing chances of Kuwait regaining its independence;
cooler weather; Moslems' January pilgrimage to Mecca, which would
make fighting then more difficult; and a more hawkish tone to
recent administration remarks.
   Scowcroft noted that one provision of the United Nations charter
that might be ``called into operation'' already establishes
procedures for assembling a multinational military force under the
U.N. flag.
   The presidential adviser noted that the charter allows the
Security Council to organize military actions against a nation if
other sanctions ``prove to be inadequate.''
   Scowcroft said, however, that Bush did not plan to include an
appeal for further United Nations action against Iraq during his
visit to the world body this weekend.
   The president was flying to New York today for a U.N. conference
on children's diseases and hunger. He will address the General
Assembly on Monday.
   After his luncheon meeting with the exiled Kuwaiti ruler on
Friday, Bush told a departure ceremony on the White House lawn,
``What normally would be a pleasurable occasion instead is a time
for sobriety and sorrow.''
   Bush reiterated his commitment to seek to isolate Saddam, the
Iraqi president, and force withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   ``His highness and I agreed that we must keep all our options
open to ensure that Iraq's unlawful occupation of Kuwait is ended
and Kuwait's legitimate government restored,'' Bush said.
   ``Iraq will fail,'' he declared.
   For his part, the exiled emir praised Bush for showing a
``principled, courageous and decisive position in the face of Iraqi
aggression'' and said he hoped the president would one day be able
to visit him in ``liberated, independent Kuwait.''
   The White House meeting was intended as a clear sign that the
United States still regards the 64-year-old emir as the legitimate
ruler of Kuwait.
   Bush has consistently insisted that not only must Iraq withdraw
its invasion troops from Kuwait but that the emir must be restored
to the power he has wielded since 1977.
   Several hundred pro-Kuwaiti demonstrators across Pennsylvania
Avenue from the White House erupted into excited cheers as Bush and
the emir briefly waved to them from the front portico.
   Briefing reporters on the meeting, Scowcroft said a peaceful
resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis remained in everyone's best
interest.
   ``The sanctions have not been in place very long,'' he said.
   But, he added, ``there is no question that what's happening
inside Kuwait affect the timetable. There is no question about
that. But I think we need to at least come to a sincere judgment as
to whether or not there's a peaceful way to resolve this.''
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a request might come before the United Nations within a week
or so, likely at the request of Kuwait, for a resolution condemning
Iraq's treatment of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Administration Sticking With 5 Million Barrel Sale of Stockpiled
Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is moving ahead with a
test sale of 5 million barrels of stockpiled oil, despite
contentions by lawmakers and its own energy secretary that the
amount is too small.
   The Energy Department sent out formal notices of the sale Friday
as the House voted to give President Bush authority to triple its
size, as recommended a day earlier by Energy Secretary James
Watkins.
   The White House stopped short of disavowing Watkins' suggestion
that the 5-million-barrel sale announced by Bush on Wednesday was
too small to even test how the 590-million-barrel Strategic
Petroleum Reserve might work in an oil emergency.
   ``We'd have to look at'' any proposal to expand it, said Steven
Hart, a White House spokesman.
   But Watkins' testimony and the House's prompt response to it
amid a doubling of crude oil prices since July left the
administration scrambling to find a single policy voice on using
the reserve.
   Although the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait removed 4.3 million
barrels of oil daily from the world market, large inventories and
shipments already on the ocean have prevented any actual shortages
from developing so far.
   But the anticipation of shortages as winter approaches and
commercial stocks begin to decline has sent prices from about $21 a
barrel when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 to $39 this week.
   The administration contended for nearly two months that the
reserve, built at a cost of $20 billion to taxpayers after the 1973
Arab oil embargo, was never intended to counter escalating oil
prices.
   However, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday that one of the purposes of the test is ``acting against
what we believe is speculation in terms of unwarranted price
increases.''
   Lawmakers have embraced claims by market analysts that Bush
could have stopped the price spiral at $25 to $27 per barrel by
tapping the reserve last month at a rate of 500,000 barrels a day.
   ``Since Aug. 2, $4 billion more in energy prices have been paid
by American consumers than should have been,'' Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., said Friday. ``Businesses are being driven into recession
by this head-in-the-sand energy policy the administration has
adopted.''
   The Energy Department has the capability to pump up to 3.5
million barrels of oil a day from the stockpile, which is stored in
salt deposits along the Louisiana-Texas coast.
   Rep. W.J. Tauzin, D-La., who guided a bill authorizing a
15-million-barrel test sale through the House on Friday, said the
administration had vowed just two weeks ago that Bush would veto
legislation with a test sale above 5 million barrels.
   Watkins, however, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee
on Thursday that a 15-million-barrel test was needed.
   ``It's our belief the secretary of energy was correct,'' Tauzin
said. ``There are no shortages. But fears of shortages are allowing
speculators on Wall Street to drive up prices and take advantage of
consumers.''
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
introduced a Senate bill Friday for a 15-million-barrel sale.
   ``The road in the Senate may not be so smooth,'' said an
administration source, who acknowledged efforts under way there to
prevent a vote on the proposal.
   Meanwhile, the Energy Department said it will open bids on the
5-million-barrel sale Oct. 5 and sign the first contracts with the
successful bidders a week later for an average daily release of
167,000 barrels.
   ``If a buyer can arrange for a tanker to be at the dock, we
could load oil the next day,'' said DOE spokesman Bob Porter. ``But
we expect most of these deliveries to occur in November.''
   Potential buyers will have to bid for minimum quantities of
200,000 barrels if delivery is to be by tanker, 75,000 barrels by
pipeline and 40,000 barrels by barge.

<HEAD>Backers of Cable Controls Vow Tougher Bill Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of legislation to re-regulate cable
television prices and services say that despite a Senate defeat,
they'll be back next year with an even tougher bill.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., on Friday objected to bringing the
bill to the floor for debate or a vote, where it was expected to
pass easily. Faced with a possible filibuster, a sponsor of the
bill, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, declared the measure ``dead and
buried'' for the 101st Congress.
   Congress is expected to adjourn as early as the middle of
October.
   Backers of the bill said the cable industry's victory may be
short-lived and that it would only strengthen the hand of would-be
competitors.
   Home satellite companies are itching to compete with cable and
are expected to push provisions of the Senate bill that guarantee
them access to cable programming. Broadcasters also want cable to
pay for the programming it now takes virtually for free.
   ``There may come a time when the cable industry will devoutly
wish they had taken today's deal,'' said Edward O. Fritts,
president of the National Association of Broadcasters.
   ``This bill was like inpatient surgery on the cable industry
dealing with surface wounds,'' said Gene Kimmelman, legislative
director of the Consumer Federation of America. ``My guess is that
next year's bill is going to be like heart and brain surgery
combined.''
   The Office of Management and Budget had issued a veto warning on
the bill, which would have restored some of the government
oversight of cable that Congress lifted in 1984.
   OMB said the bill imposed too many restrictions on cable and
that increased competition - perhaps from the telephone industry -
was the answer to any problems in the cable industry. Basic cable
prices on average have risen 43 percent in the past three years.
   Wirth said service and prices had been the driving forces behind
the bill, ``but we have gone far beyond that. ... There are some
provisions in there that don't have anything to do with rates or
service.''
   Cable executives had said they could live with some form of rate
re-regulation, but they bitterly opposed provisions that would have
imposed strict business restrictions on their industry, including
banning exclusive programming contracts.
   Nonetheless, the bill had been expected to pass by a wide
margin. A similar version sailed through the House on a voice vote
earlier this month.
   ``Consumers are outraged and we have the opportunity to do
something about it. And we will do something about it next year,''
said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., one of the bill's architects. ``But
as for now, the cable companies have won. They get to increase the
price of service and allow the quality of service to deteriorate
until the Congress acts.''
   The legislation would require cable systems to provide a ``basic
tier'' of local broadcast and public TV channels and require the
FCC to monitor rates for cable-owned programming such as MTV.
   The House bill would prohibit programmers owned by cable
operators from ``unreasonably refusing to deal'' with competitors
and require them to provide their signals to backyard satellite
users.

<TEXT>
   A highway patrolmen's group gave
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Dianne Feinstein a $150,000
contribution, a donation made possible by a federal judge's ruling
overturning contribution limits for statewide candidates.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton of Sacramento was asked
Friday to delay his ruling while the initiative's backers appeal
it. He later rejected the request. The decision six weeks before
the Nov. 6 election has turned campaign funding into chaos.
   Meanwhile, Republican Pete Wilson began television ads claiming
overwhelming police support.
   Wilson was endorsed by the California Narcotics Officers
Association, which represents 5,000 federal, state and local
anti-drug officers.

<HEAD>Lieutenant Governor TV - Positive So Far</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a campaign year splattered by
mudslinging television ads, there's a little good humor in the
lieutenant governor's race between Bob Bullock and Rob Moosebacker,
er Meesebecker, er whatshisname.
   Neither candidate so far is using a TV ad attacking the other.
   Democrat Bullock touts his record in state government, and GOP
candidate Rob Mosbacher Jr. pokes fun at his lack of name
identification.
   The Republican's 30-second spot features a line of folks
mispronouncing his name - ``Messbacker ... Mossmacker ...
Mossbicker ... Muckbacker.''
   Interrupting now and then are the candidate and his children,
chuckling and explaining: ``No, Mosbacher.''
   ``Because of the nasty, negative natureof the campaigns through
the summer on television by many of the candidates, we decided to
try to do something a little different,'' said Mark Sanders,
Mosbacher's press secretary.
   The Mosbacher ad was the candidate's own idea, although some
advisers initially were skeptical, Sanders said.
   Bullock, meanwhile, is emphasizing his accomplishments at the
comptroller's office, where he has served for five terms. His
commercials end by calling him ``an independent voice for Texas.''
   ``He shakes up the bureaucrats, says no to special interests, no
to high insurance rates and forces out-of-state corporations to pay
billions in taxes,'' the ad says.

   Republican candidate for governor Pierre
Rinfret's campaign claims that state GOP Chairman J. Patrick
Barrett had offered to resign.
   A top aide to Barrett quickly denied Friday that any such offer
had been made.
   Rinfret strategist Eddie Mahe and campaign spokesman Ted Kavanau
both insisted that Barrett had offered to step down earlier this
week, but was asked to stay on by Rinfret.
   ``That is not true,'' said Barrett aide Elizabeth DelTorto
angrily. ``Pat did not offer to resign.''
   Rinfret, whose campaign tactics of late have been termed
``bizarre'' by one former state GOP chairman, first mentioned the
Barrett resignation offer during a flight to the Utica area
Thursday.
   During that flight, Rinfret also said he might seek the state
chairmanship if he lost his bid to unseat Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo. A recent independent statewide poll showed Cuomo with a
massive lead over Rinfret, a millionaire economist making his first
run for public office.
   ``I'm sure Pat Barrett will step aside for me,'' said Rinfret,
adding later that Barrett ``hasn't been a leader.''
   Barrett, a former head of the Avis car rental company, has said
previously that he has no intention of leaving the party
chairmanship.

   A new Jesse Helms television ad touting his
support for environmental legislation ``is a calculated distortion
of his disgraceful record,'' the North Carolina Sierra Club chapter
says.
   The Helms campaign said the Sierra Club was distorting the
Republican senator's record.
   ``If you believe that Jesse Helms is a friend of the
environment, then you'd believe that Saddam Hussein is a
peace-loving man and a friend to motorists everywhere,'' said Randy
Schenck, the state Sierra Club conservation chairman.
   The 30-second television commercial for Helms' Senate campaign
says Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt, while mayor of Charlotte,
asked to have his city exempted from the Clean Air Act. It also
says that Helms has supported bills to make oil companies clean up
spills and to protect the New River from being dammed.

<HEAD>Forest Service Says Logging Ban Will Affect 3 Million Acres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Forest Service says saving the northern
spotted owl from extinction will require banning logging next year
on 3 million acres of the Northwest's oldest forests.
   And some lawmakers, while fearful of the impact on timber jobs,
say they are optimistic that adoption of a credible protection plan
will help avert environmental lawsuits that threaten to bring the
region's logging to a standstill.
   Concerned that its current protection plan may violate the
Endangered Species Act, the Forest Service announced Friday it will
follow instead the recommendations offered in April by one of its
biologists, Jack Ward Thomas, and a panel of government scientists.
   Congressmen said the move will mean greater cuts in logging than
the White House predicted last week.
   The Forest Service estimated last spring that the Thomas plan
would cause federal timber harvests in the Northwest to fall by
nearly 50 percent and result in the loss of more than 20,000
logging jobs.
   However, President Bush last week endorsed a finding by a White
House task force that the owl could be saved from extinction by
reducing next year's harvests by only about 20 percent - from this
year's 3.85 billion board feet to about 3 billion board feet.
   Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., said Friday's announcement by the
Forest Service means that harvests will tumble to about 2.6 billion
board feet. ``This is just a further cave-in to the folks that are
trying to put us out of business,'' said Smith, a strong supporter
of the timber industry.
   The action came as environmentalists were preparing to return to
federal court in Seattle to try to force the Forest Service to
accept a scientifically sound plan to protect the spotted owl's
habitat in the Northwest's old-growth forests.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service on June 22 declared the rare owl a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. An estimated
3,000 pair live in the Pacific Northwest, their only habitat.
   Lawmakers said the Thomas proposal would be the most sweeping
protection of wildlife in the history of the act, banning logging
on 3 million acres of national forests currently open to harvests -
an area larger than the state of Maryland.
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said implementation of the Thomas plan
should help prevent an onslaught of environmental lawsuits that
could block the sale of much greater amounts of timber.
   Todd True, an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,
said the action was overdue. ``Certainly it is appropriate that the
old (plan) has been thrown out and recognized as the poor job it
has always been,'' the environmental lawyer said.
   But Evelyn Badger of the pro-industry Oregon Lands Coalition
said the announcement means that Forest Service Chief Dale
Robertson ``has just signed eviction notices for tens of thousands
of families in the Northwest.''
   The Thomas plan will remain in force until Congress adopts
another plan or the Fish and Wildlife Service adopts a permanent
recovery plan for the owl.

   Darkness hampered a Coast Guard effort to
determine the extent of a petroleum spill from a collision Friday
between a tanker and a barge, authorities said.
   A tanker struck one of two barges being towed by a tugboat in
the Houston Ship Channel, where about 700,000 gallons of oil
spilled in a July accident, the Coast Guard said.
   The leaking barge contained reformate, a volatile, colorless
liquid product of petroleum distillation that is used as a
manufacturing solvent, a dry-cleaning fluid and a gasoline-blending
stock.
   The Coast Guard's marine safety office in Galveston said the
collision occurred at 9 p.m. about 3 miles east of a Galveston Bay
beach.
   Details remained sketchy early today. No injuries were reported.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Frank Whipple said darkness prevented
authorities from determining the extent of the spill.
   The 538-foot-long Norwegian tanker, designed to carry a chemical
cargo of undetermined size, was not damaged, Whipple said.
   A slick formed from the leaking barge and a spill response team
from contractor Garner Environmental Co. of Houston was sent to the
spill, he said.
   The collision occurred as the tanker was leaving Houston and the
297-foot-long barges, both loaded with reformate, were coming in,
Whipple said.
   ``The tug was able to push the barges out of the channel and up
onto the bank,'' Whipple said. ``They are resting on the bank.''
   The July 28 collision between the Greek tanker Shinoussa and two
barges in the ship channel spewed crude oil into the
environmentally sensitive bay.
   On June 8, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg was rocked by an
explosion about 58 miles offshore from Galveston, dumping more than
3.9 million gallons of oil.

<HEAD>GAO Doubts Ability of Anti-Tank Apache Helicopters to Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's Apache anti-tank helicopter needs
repairs after an average 2{ hours in the air during peacetime and
may be useless in war, say congressional investigators.
   The Apache's see-in-the-dark electronics, 30mm cannon, guided
missiles and rockets make it a powerful tank killer when in
operation. It has been deployed to Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert
Shield.
   The Army has ordered all but 66 of 807 Apaches it planned to
purchase from McDonnel-Douglas Corp. for $12 billion.
   But the General Accounting Office, in a report issued Friday,
said rather than buy more of the helicopters, the Army should beef
up the maintenance organization devoted to the aircraft.
   A similar GAO recommendation was made in April, when the Army
had 132 choppers to go, but another 66 helicopters were bought
anyway.
   Investigators said the Army has too few Apache mechanics. About
100 maintenance personnel assigned to an Apache battalion take care
of 39 helicopters, including 18 Apaches. The Marine Corps, however,
achieves far more flying hours with 225 technicians taking care of
24 simpler helicopters.
   The GAO said in April that Apaches were ``fully mission
capable'' only about half the time, far short of the Army's 70
percent goal. The figure was repeated in Friday's report.
   ``Why buy more headaches?'' Richard Davis, director of the GAO's
Army Issues Group, asked in an April appearance before Congress.
``Use the money to operate and fix existing Apaches.''
   ``Given that the Apache has not been able to attain availability
goals in peacetime despite favorable conditions, it is questionable
whether it can meet the far more strenuous demands of
high-intensity combat,'' the GAO said in the Friday report.
   The GAO said the aircraft's electronics fault detection system
about 40 percent of the time detects a fault that does not actually
exist.
   In addition, soldiers maintaining the Apache spend only about 30
percent of their time repairing the aircraft. They spend the rest
of their time on required assignments such as guard duty, physical
training, motor pool detail, marksmanship testing and other such
tasks. For this reason, re-enlistment rates are low and experienced
mechanics rare in Apache battalions.
   Components fail at rates far higher than expected when the
aircraft was designed - for instance, the main rotors must be
replaced every 164 hours instead of lasting 1,500 hours, GAO said.
   According to the GAO, the Army's commander in Europe has said
``as much as 50 percent of the time Apaches spend in the hangars
for maintenance is devoted to troubleshooting and that this time
was increasing.''
   In an Aug. 31 letter to the GAO, David J. Berteau, principal
deputy assistant secretary of defense for production and logistics,
said the agency's findings ``mostly portray the readiness and
support problems of the Apache helicopter of about 18-24 months ago
and were not new to the Army.''
   Maj. Nancy Burt said Friday that the Army and McDonnell Douglas
had identified 173 problems, resolved 106 and are fixing 67.
   Burt also said that Apaches sent to the Persian Gulf have exceed
the service's goals for capability.
   In April, GAO officials testified that the Army handpicked six
of its best Apaches for the invasion of Panama last December.
   One helicopter never took off because of a hydraulic failure,
the fuel cell failed in another and still another was forced to
return to the base when its target detection system didn't work,
the GAO said.
   Complicating matters were the helicopters' sensitive electronic
components that failed to work when rain and humidity caused a
build up of moisture. Army officials were forced to dry the parts
in kitchen ovens, the GAO said.
   The GAO report was requested by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, and Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
its panel on oversight and investigations.

   Millions of Iranians on Friday protested the U.S.-led forces in
the Persian Gulf with chants of ``Death to America!'' and Iraq
warned that war in the region would ravage other Arab states and
Israel.
   Also Friday, Britain began sending some of the 6,000 ground
troops it promised to add to the forces in the Saudi Desert, the
Defense Ministry in London said.
   President Bush promised the exiled leader of Kuwait that his
country will not remain under Iraqi control.
   ``Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity will be
restored,'' Bush said after meeting with Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah. The White House meeting was intended as a sign that the
United States still regards the emir as the legitimate ruler of
Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2.
   A Bush aide said the graphic account of the Iraqi occupation
that the exiled ruler gave Bush could lead the president to push
for tougher U.N. action against Saddam Hussein, including
U.N.-backed military action.
   ``That's one of those things that's conceivable,'' said Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
   Al-Sabah described ``terrifying conditions'' in Kuwait,
including soldiers taking patients off life support systems and
removing babies from incubators so the equipment could be shipped
back to Iraq, Scowcroft said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he feels the administration ``is looking more
favorably on an early war option.''
   The Wisconsin Democrat said he based this assessment on four
factors: The diminishing chances of Kuwait regaining its
independence, cooler weather, Moslems' January pilgrimage to Mecca,
which would make fighting then more difficult, and a more hawkish
tone to Bush administration remarks.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said millions of Iranians
staged demonstrations nationwide, denouncing the United States and
Israel.
   ``We have seen how they have defiled our sacred lands, the land
of divine revelations, just as they did in Jerusalem, by bringing
corruption, devastation, godlessness and debauchery to that
hallowed region,'' a reporter said in a live report from the Tehran
rally.
   Iran has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but it also has
deplored the U.S.-led forces sent to protect Saudi Arabia and
enforce a U.N.-imposed embargo against Baghdad. It says it is
honoring the blockade, however.
   The protests capped a week of celebrations marking the
anniversary of the beginning of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Iran
sees cause for celebration because last month Baghdad caved in to
its demands for peace, ending two years of deadlocked talks. Some
observers say that in return Baghdad expects Iran to circumvent the
embargo and deliver food to Iraq.
   Iraq's government newspaper Al-Jomhouriya again warned about
widespread devastation if war broke out. ``The battle arenas would
be multiple and the fires would devour all oil fields, the Zionist
entity and agents of America in the region,'' it said in an
editorial.
   The newspaper was referring to Israel and Egypt, Syria, Morocco,
and Arab Gulf states cooperating with the United States in the
multinational buildup following the invasion of Kuwait.
   British ground forces bound for the gulf began leaving ports in
Britain and Germany, the Defense Ministry said in London.
   Initial estimates put the number of troops of the 7th Armored
Brigade and support units being sent to the gulf at between 6,000
and 8,000. But The Times of London said Saturday that the number
could reach 9,000.
   Three thousand British military personnel aboard ships or with
air force fighter units are already in the gulf.
   The main weapon of Iraq's opponents in the gulf standoff has
been the economic embargo imposed by the United Nations. The world
body this week extended the land and sea blockade to the air.   Foreign
ministers from the United States, Britain, China, France
and the Soviet Union met with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, and released another statement condemning the Iraqi
invasion, while emphasizing their commitment to seeking a peaceful
solution.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen addressed the issue in a
speech to the U.N. General Assembly in which he omitted China's
standard opposition to ``big power'' involvement in the gulf.
Western diplomats said the omission could reflect greater Chinese
acceptance of, and possibly support for, the U.S. military buildup
in Saudi Arabia.
   The commander of the American battle group patrolling outside
the gulf said Friday he doubted that ships were evading it by
hugging the Iranian coast.
   ``Personally I feel that we are being 100 percent effective,''
said Rear Adm. Jerry Unruh. ``Iraq may be loading their ships with
oil, but their ships are not coming out.''
   Turkey enforced the air embargo by searching Indian, Soviet and
Polish planes bound for Baghdad.
   In Paris, representatives of the United States and 20
industrialized nations met to discuss how to replenish oil supplies
if they are depleted by the crisis.
   The nations are members of the International Energy Agency,
which issued a communique that said it was preparing to protect the
West from an oil supply crisis but that there was no immediate need
to use strategic reserves to offset embargoed oil from Iraq and
Kuwait. If a significant oil shortfall develops, the board will
hold an emergency session, the communique said.
   Investor fears sent some stock markets plunging.
   Stock prices dropped to the lowest point in 3{ years in Tokyo,
and analysts blamed fear of war in the Middle East, high interest
rates and climbing oil prices.
   The U.S. government said its main economic forecasting gauge -
the Index of Leading Economic Indicators - declined 1.2 percent in
August following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the steepest drop in
three years.
   In other developments:
   -The Iraqi News Agency said radical Palestinian leader Mohammed
Abbas vowed to strike American interests if any Iraqi aircraft were
attacked to enforce the air embargo.
   -A grenade attack killed the 9-year-old son of a French soldier
and wounded 17 other people in the Red Sea nation of Djibouti,
which has served as a staging ground for French forces in the
Persian Gulf, officials said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
Thursday night and it was unknown wether it was linked to the gulf
crisis.
   -Spain and South Korea joined other nations in pulling envoys
from embassies besieged by Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
   -Bulgaria has offered to send 400 troops to the gulf, the U.S.
State Department said. The Poles, Czechs and Romanians have offered
medical facilities.

<TEXT>
   An environmental activist group is seeking a
federal court order to stop the scheduled launch next week of the
space shuttle Discovery with the nuclear-powered Ulysses sun probe
in its cargo bay.
   ``We have an extraordinary risk here from an agency whose
competency in the last year has been abysmal,'' said Andrew C.
Kimbrell, a lawyer for the Foundation on Economic Trends, which
asked Friday for a preliminary injunction.
   The organization's motion is the latest round in a legal battle
begun last year when the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration dispatched the Galileo probe to Jupiter from shuttle
Atlantis.
   At that time, U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch refused to stop
the launch and Galileo was sent on its way.
   The foundation's Friday motion was made part of that earlier
suit, brought by the Florida Coalition on Peace and Justice. The
coalition staged a demonstration last Saturday at the Kennedy Space
Center.
   ``It was not unexpected,'' said NASA general counsel Edward
Frankle. ``It's basically similar to the one that was done last
year in Galileo and I hope it has the same result.''
   Both planetary probes use electricity generated by decaying
radioactive pellets of plutonium-238, which causes cancer and death
in humans if inhaled.
   The United States has launched 23 missions with nuclear power
sources; three have had accidents, including one that released
radioactive materials. NASA said the risk with Ulysses is minimal.
   Galileo carried 49.6 pounds of plutonium to provide power for
the $1.5 million probe on its six-year journey, during which it
will twice fly close to Earth for added momentum.
   The Ulysses probe, which is to be ejected from Discovery's cargo
bay hours after the shuttle launch Oct. 6, carries just under 23.7
pounds of plutonium-238, which Kimbrell called ``one of the most
toxic substances known to man.''
   The current complaint restates the risk of a Challenger-like
explosion on launch and introduces an element not present last
year: the fuel leaks that three times have stopped the launch of
shuttle Columbia since May. NASA has grounded the shuttle until an
investigative team solves the problems.
   ``Until NASA shows it can become competent again, it should not
be in the business of putting nuclear fuel in space,'' Kimbrell
said.
   The motion to Gasch says the challenged launch ``comes at a time
of crisis and confusion at NASA.'' It said the agency is being
criticized in Congress and elsewhere ``for unreliability in
predicting mission goals and risks and lack of quality control.''
   ``Basically, we are saying where are their studies on where the
hydrogen leaks are coming from,'' Kimbrell said. ``Where are the
hard numbers on radiation risks on actual risks of a shuttle
explosion?''
   The government has until Tuesday to respond.

   The Chicago Tribune violated federal labor law by
not signing a new contract with 427 striking mailers and must pay
any wages or benefits lost, an administrative law judge has ruled.
   A union official said the cost could run as high as $10 million.
   Robert A. Giannasi, an administrative law judge with the
National Labor Relations Board, said the newspaper should pay the
1985 strikers for any loss of wages or benefits since July 27,
1987, when the Chicago Mailers Union Local 2 accepted a
Tribune-offered contract that the newspaper then refused to sign.
   The Tribune held that the union no longer was the workers'
bargaining representative, the newspaper reported Friday. The story
added that the newspaper planned to appeal the decision, which was
released Thursday.
   Giannasi's order also requires that the newspaper pay back wages
at the higher, negotiated rate to about 200 workers who replaced
striking mailers.
   ``We're just guessing, but this could cost the Tribune better
than $10 million,'' said Robert C. Maida, secretary-treasurer of
Chicago Mailers Local 2.

   One of the most intriguing political
realignments triggered by the Persian Gulf crisis is the one
between King Hussein of Jordan and radical PLO factions he has
feuded with for 20 years.
   George Habash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and Nayef Hawatmeh of the Marxist Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine were feted as heroes when they returned
to Jordan last week for the first time in two decades.
   They left as the sworn enemies of Hussein but returned to Amman
as allies, thrown into his arms by political fallout in the wake of
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Hussein has pledged to honor the U.N. sanctions against Iraq,
but the king steered clear of a confrontation with Saddam Hussein.
   Jordan is heavily reliant on Iraq for trade and cheap oil.
Jordan's 3 million Palestinian residents - half its population -
strongly back Saddam, who has positioned himself as the champion of
Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel.
   Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser
Arafat has turned away from Syrian President Hafez Assad, a
traditional foe of Saddam who has sent troops to bolster the
multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
   The warm reception for Habash and Hawatmeh in Amman last week
appalled the U.S. State Department.
   Habash described his meeting with the monarch at his palace
Sept. 18 as cordial. ``We came out with the impression that we
share the same political ground ... We're facing a common danger,''
he told reporters.
   Habash and Hawatmeh were received by the king ``more as old
friends, rather than former deadly enemies,'' a senior Jordanian
official said.
   ``You wouldn't have thought that 20 years ago the two
Palestinians were fighting to topple the king or have him
assassinated,'' said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Many Palestinians had moved into Jordan after the 1967 war in
which Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. In 1970, Habash's
guerrillas hijacked three airliners and blew them up in the
Jordanian desert, after evacuating the passengers.
   Hussein, fearing that the growing power of the PLO threatened
his Hashemite throne and was drawing punitive Israeli military
strikes against Jordan, decided to move against them.
   Habash and Hawatmeh fled Amman on Sept. 30, 1970, after 13 days
of fierce house-to-house fighting between Palestinian guerrillas
and King Hussein's tough Bedouin troopers.
   The Palestinians suffered close to 10,000 casualties during
``Black September'' and began referring to the king as the
``Butcher of Amman.'' Government forces lost more than 600 dead and
1,500 wounded.
   Many of the Palestinians leaders dispersed to Damascus or
Lebanon, where their heavily armed presence and alliance with
leftist Moslems contributed to the outbreak of the Lebanese civil
war, which continues today.
   Ironically, King Hussein could yet find his throne in danger
again.
   He has already paid a high price for his support for Iraq. Saudi
Arabia last week cut off financial aid worth $300 million a year to
the economically strapped kingdom and blocked oil deliveries.
   Political and diplomatic sources in Amman believe that any
attempt by the king to adopt a more pro-American stand would spark
off massive protests that could endanger the throne.
   Crown Prince Hassan, the king's brother, complained Friday of a
lack of understanding from the West. Jordan was respecting
sanctions, he said, even though it has meant a 50 percent decline
in the gross national product.
   ``Is it expected that Jordan commit economic hari kari?'' he
said during a conference in Washington. ``Are we expected to commit
economic suicide?''

   It won't happen next season, but there might
still be a move in store for Roseanne Barr's hit television show.
   Tom Arnold, Barr's husband, said earlier this week they plan to
buy a house in the Twin Cities and bring with them production of
``Roseanne,'' possibly as early as next season.
   David Brokaw, a spokesman for the company that produces the ABC
series, said Friday the move is too expensive and will not happen
any time soon.
   ``But we will definitely take a look at it in the future,''
Brokaw said in a statement he issued jointly with Barr and Arnold.
   Arnold said he and Barr want out of the ``loony bin'' that
passes for their life in Los Angeles.

   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Archbishop Desmond Tutu says the
United States is vacillating on the value of sanctions against
South Africa's apartheid government.
   Tutu spoke Friday at Seton Hall University, where he was honored
for his civil rights work on behalf of blacks in South Africa. He
told a crowd of about 500 people that sanctions should be
maintained until apartheid is dismantled.
   ``We hope your government is not going to lift sanctions
prematurely,'' Tutu said.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, heads the 2.6
million-member Anglican Church of the Province of Southern Africa.

   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to pump up
Nebraska and the rest of the United States.
   The actor and bodybuilder told a crowd of more than 4,000 people
Friday he plans to visit every state to promote fitness as chairman
of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.
   He told the crowd at the University of Nebraska Coliseum that
he'll return to the state to check on the progress of physical
education and fitness programs in schools.

   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Zimbabwe President Robert G. Mugabe,
at a ceremony in which Michigan State University gave him an
honorary doctor of laws degree, said there are new signs of hope
for democracy in South Africa.
   Mugabe, Zimbabwe's first president elected under majority rule,
said at Friday's ceremony he hopes current peace initiatives in
South Africa will lead to elimination of apartheid and ``create a
non-racial democratic order as a new political reality.''
   ``Hence encouragement should be given to all forces fighting to
dismantle apartheid and to replace it with the desired just social
and political order,'' Mugabe said.

   CHICAGO (AP) - A South Side street that was once a hub for jazz
and blues will be renamed after the late Sammy Davis Jr.
   Davis, who died this summer of cancer, performed in Chicago
throughout his career, beginning in the early 1940s.
   ``Legendary artists of the '30s, '40s and '50s were showcased in
clubs and theaters and even private homes that lined 31st Street,
which was once the hub of jazz and blues,'' Mayor Richard M. Daley
said.
   ``Thus it's only fitting that this street is chosen to honor one
of the greatest performers in show business, the late Sammy Davis
Jr,'' he said.
   City officials planned a ceremony Thursday to change the
street's name.
   --
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Former President Reagan renewed his
friendship with country-music king Roy Acuff during a visit to the
Music City to address a bottlers convention.
   Acuff and Reagan spent about 15 minutes together Friday night,
discussing sports, retirement and other topics, said Grand Ole Opry
spokesman Jerry Strobel.
   ``Mr. Acuff wanted to thank him for coming to Nashville for his
81st birthday celebration in 1984,'' Strobel said. ``And President
Reagan said, `Glad to do it - it's always a treat to see Roy
Acuff.' ''
   The men have been friends since the 1940s, when Reagan was
president of the Screen Actors Guild and Acuff was in Hollywood
making movies.
   Reagan also served as honorary chairman of a May 1984 tribute to
Acuff at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

   Weary congressional and Bush administration
officials headed today into what could be a last-ditch attempt to
fashion a deficit reduction agreement and avoid massive cuts in
federal services Monday morning.
   ``Lots of issues are left,'' Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas told reporters after a lengthy session ended late Friday
night.
   Dole added, ``I'm optimistic. We are committed to getting it
done.''
   A source familiar with the negotiations said Republicans
indicated they might be ready to give up their insistence on a
capital gains tax cut demanded by President Bush - the issue that
has been the source of most of the debate during the more than four
months of budget talks. Democrats have claimed that the tax, which
is charged against the profits on property sales, is of primary
benefit to the rich.
   The source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
bargainers tentatively agreed to scale back a planned increase in
taxes on beer, wine and liquor and to impose some new limitations
on the total amount of itemized deductions allowed for high income
couples and individuals.
   The House and Senate scheduled rare Sunday sessions in
anticipation of an agreement that would cut the deficit by about
$50 billion during the budget year that begins Monday and by
another $450 billion in the following four years.
   Monday could be chaotic for federal workers and for users of
many government services unless a deficit reduction package is
produced. If no agreement is in place, $85 billion in arbitrary
spending reductions will be forced on hundreds of government
programs ranging from meat inspection to air traffic control.
   Social Security, military and congressional salaries, and many
initiatives for the poor are exempt from the cuts.
   But more than 1 million of the 2.1 million civilian federal
workers already have received notices that they will be furloughed
up to 22 days during the next year. The office of Management and
Budget told agency heads Friday that all employees should report to
work on Monday and those considered nonessential would be sent
home.
   The situation is made worse by the fact that Congress has failed
to enact any of the 13 annual appropriation bills for the new
budget year. Lawmakers are ready to approve stopgap legislation to
extend spending authority for another 20 days, but Bush has
promised to veto the measure unless it is striped of a provision
postponing the mandatory $85 billion in cuts until Oct. 20.
   The president insists that the pressure of mandatory cuts is
necessary to force agreement on a package of targeted spending
reductions and tax increases.
   Among the most contentious issues still to be resolved is
whether Social Security beneficiaries should be made to pay a
greater share of the deficit reduction cost. One proposal under
consideration would increase from 50 percent to 85 percent the
share of Social Security benefits on which higher income recipients
could be taxed. Another would delay for two or three months the
Jan. 19, 1991 cost of living increase in benefits.

   World-class gridlock, protests galore and
security sweeps at Bergdorf Goodman before the arrival of important
shoppers make it General Assembly time again in the Big Apple.
   And this year the ranks of world leaders at the United Nations
are swollen by the pull of the World Summit for Children.
   Earlybirds zipped around at various events Friday - President
Patricio Aylwin of Chile speaking at a foreign affairs forum;
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu picking up an honorary degree
at New York University; Queen Fabiola of Belgium visiting the
Covenant House shelter for runaways.
   Some of the 160 expected leaders, including heads of state and
foreign ministers, are staying at their nation's embassies. For the
rest, Manhattan hotels readied a welcome.
   ``Our Indianapolis 500,'' said Jim Mastrangelo, sales manager of
the United Nations Plaza Hotel.
   There will be no speedway, however.
   ``This will be the largest number of world dignitaries assembled
in New York at one time,'' said city Transportation Commissioner
Lucius Riccio. ``There is the potential for a very large
international gridlock.''
   Only President Bush, expected to arrive today, gets traffic
frozen. Police planned to immobilize cars and pedestrians along the
president's route. On past visits, the freezes have lasted an hour.
Bush was scheduled to address the United Nations Monday.
   Various groups have scheduled a score of demonstrations around
U.N. events, and the dignitaries may also run into other protests.
   For example, should any of them pop into a fast food joint for a
snack, they might encounter members of the Coalition to Liberate
Animals Worldwide. The coalition promised to make dining
uncomfortable for meat-eaters at various chain diners in midtown.
   Shoppers at the swank Bergdorf Goodman witnessed a sweep
Thursday by phalanxes of security men in advance of a browse by a
foreign bigwig.
   ``They're big shoppers,'' said Elizabeth Maguire, speaking for
the Plaza hotel, where Suzan Mubarak, wife of Egypt's president,
and a number of other international guests are staying.
   ``But the rumor is that they've all been clued into Secaucus,''
she added, referring to a bustling discount center across the
Hudson River in New Jersey.

<TEXT>
   Business is booming at the Twins Cafe
since the 89-year sisters who own it decided to close up after 37
years.
   Twins Hassie Seivers and Lassie Disney have had enough of their
grueling 4 a.m. to 4 p.m., six-day-a-week, cooking-to-cleaning
schedule.
   On Oct. 6, the day this East Tennessee town celebrates its 100th
birthday, the twins will dish up food and conversation for the last
time.
   ``It's not retirement. We're just quitting work,'' Lassie said.
   ``We're not exactly quitting,'' Hassie added. ``We're
changing.''
   Their cafe is a four-booth, six-table,
five-stools-at-the-lunch-counter operation with a small neon sign
outside and an open invitation to a bottomless cup of coffee you
can get yourself.
   The menu jokingly offers ``ham an tue aigs an gravie or grits''
for $2.75.
   The customers are mostly Clinton residents - everyone from
workmen to lawyers. But the guest list has grown since the twins
delivered a pie, some lard-baked biscuits and several one-liners on
``The Tonight Show'' show in March.
   After a newspaper reported the twins planned to close the
restaurant, the cafe became standing-room-only.
   ``One more time, they say,'' Hassie said.
   The sisters are widows with lots of family. They say they'll
help out the Salvation Army, go to church socials and attend
meetings of their American Association of Retired Persons group.
   ``There'll be plenty for them to do,'' said Wayne Seivers,
Hassie's 34-year-old grandson. ``But they are going to miss this.
If they've ever taken a week's vacation, it's been a rare
occurrence.''
   The twins grew up ``about eight miles down the road in the
country,'' Hassie said. They've always dressed alike, ``even going
to the bathroom.''
   They came to Clinton at age 15 to work in a hosiery mill. The
pay was 5 cents an hour, 10 hours a day. They worked there for more
than 30 years.
   Two years after leaving the mill, they started the Twins Cafe
with $800 borrowed from Hassie's husband's stepmother's brother. It
was Sept. 7, 1953.
   Over the years, the cafe moved from one side of Clinton's
block-long business district to another. The sisters also sold the
restaurant a time or two. ``And we wanted it back, every time,''
Hassie said.
   The shortest time anyone else owned the cafe was four days.
``They just didn't keep it long enough to get to know our guests,''
Lassie said.
   The twins were enjoying the diner's final moments.
   ``A lady says not long ago, `Well, how much longer you going to
stay?' I said, `All day,''' Lassie said.
   ``Then I went over to another booth and a lady says, `Have you
been back there cooking all day?' I said, `No, the day's not gone
yet.'''
   When customers ask, ``Have you been here all your life?'' Lassie
responds. ``No, I'm not dead yet.''

   A 15-year-old girl whose song promoting peace
captivated Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev is organizing an
airlift of granola bars and lip balm for U.S. soldiers in the
Persian Gulf.
   Sherry Lynn Biedrzycki said she got the idea from news reports
on mail and meal times being the most important parts of the
soldiers' long, hot days in the desert.
   ``I saw on `Good Morning America' a soldier who looked into the
camera at mail time and he said `looks like there's no mail for
me,' '' Sherry said. ``I felt really bad for him.''
   Sherry gained international attention in 1987 when her song ``We
Can Walk in Peace'' caught the eyes of Soviet and U.S. leaders
during the height of nuclear arms reduction talks. The tune earned
her a visit from then-President Reagan and a trip to the Soviet
Union to meet Gorbachev.
   The latest effort of the suburban Milwaukee girl began two weeks
ago at St. Francis High School.
   ``She was going to start a letter writing campaign at school and
then she decided that she could do better than that,'' said
Sherry's mother, Judy.
   The Milwaukee office of the Vietnam Veterans Foundation has
agreed to send Sherry's care packages of granola bars, other
snacks, packaged drink mixes and lip balm to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Sherry's a very busy little girl,'' said Michael Pepp, special
events coordinator for the group.
   Pepp said the items likely would be on their way next week.
   ``My teacher is also helping me,'' Sherry said. ``She's giving
extra credits for people who do this.''
   Sherry managed to persuade the parent company of the Pick 'N
Save food store chain in Wisconsin to donate items, a feat that
amazed her mother.
   ``I said Sherry, you're never going to get anywhere with Pick 'N
Save, that's a big grocery store,'' Mrs. Biedrzycki said. ``But the
manager said `Well, of course.' I was real surprised.''
   Sherry wants teen-agers all over the United States to join in
her effort.
   ``I want this to be a teen project and show that teens care
about soldiers,'' she said. ``I know that teens care about this and
I want to put our caring into action.''
   Elsewhere, homemade cookies flowed into Memphis for transport
overseas to the troops, according to participants in Operation
Cookie Drop.
   Guaranteed Air Freight and Forwarding of Memphis volunteered to
transport the estimated 500,000 cookies by truck to New York today,
where they will be inspected by the government and shipped.
   ``This has really taken on a national type awareness,'' said Ken
Veneklase, regional manager of Guaranteed Air Freight.
   Kathy Young, who organized the operation, said the tins full of
cookies must be labeled with the name and address of the person
sending them.
   Ms. Young, who sent home-baked cookies to soldiers during the
Vietnam War, said response to the three-week local drive was
overwhelming.
   ``Citizens called me and asked to help,'' Ms. Young said. ``I
have never had to ask anyone to help.''

<HEAD>U.S. Refused $100 Million Offer From Taiwan, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, not wanting to
alienate China, refused Taiwan's offer of about $100 million to
help pay for the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, a newspaper
reported today.
   The United States wants to remain on good terms with China,
which has one of five permanent seats on the United Nations
Security Council, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's
editions.
   The United States has depended on China in the Security Council
to support sanctions against Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion and
subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   Taiwan made its $100 million offer through its Vice Foreign
Minister C.J. Chen during his recent visit to Washington, the Times
quoted unidentified diplomatic sources as saying.
   U.S. officials have sought donations from other countries to pay
for the deployment of thousands of American troops to Saudi Arabia
and the Persian Gulf region.
   But the administration refused the Taiwanese offer not wanting
to upset Beijing, which has always opposed any official recognition
of the Taipei government, the newspaper said. There was no
immediate administration response to the report.
   A spokesman at the Taiwanese Coordination Council for North
American Affairs in Washington would neither confirm nor deny the
offer.
   ``Speaking hypothetically, even if we did make an offer and it
was turned down, we would be understanding,'' the unidentified
spokesman said. ``If the sanctions fail to take effect, the
Administration will still need the Communist regime's
cooperation.''
   However, the Times said some sources indicated the Taiwanese
government was angered by the rebuff.
   U.S. officials apparently told Taiwan to give the money instead
to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, but Vice Foreign Minister Chen did not
want to do this, the Times said.
   Taiwan recently announced it would give $30 million to those
countries.
   President Bush and National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft met
with former Chinese ambassador to the United States Han Xu two
weeks ago.
   Han, a friend of Bush's, came seeking a renewal of high-level
contacts between the two countries that were broken after Chinese
soldiers attacked pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Hundreds were left dead.

   Assailants threw a bomb that exploded
outside a U.S. drug firm this morning, slightly injuring a
bystander and causing little damage, police said.
   The attack on Vicks International was the seventh in four days
against American companies, including Squibb, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
   It was also one of at least 32 explosions in the capital since
Aug. 13 when the spate of bombings allegedly committed by renegade
soldiers began.
   Police Sgt. Mario Tolentino said officials were unable to
identify today's attackers. The explosion took place outside the
compound of Vicks International, a pharmaceutical division of
Proctor and Gamble, an American company.
   Tolentino said one of the assailants hurled the homemade
explosive device from one of the two cars that drove by. The bomb
hit the company's wire fence and bounced off the street where it
exploded, injuring a bystander.
   On Thursday, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said his government
was worried about the rash of bombings which have hit American
companies since Wednesday. He told Americans in Manila to ``hang in
there and be careful.''
   Early Thursday, bombs were exploded outside the Squibb drug
company and Wyeth-Suaco Laboratories also in Makati. The explosions
in the two U.S. drug companies caused little damage and no
injuries, police said.
   Minutes earlier, police also defused a bomb at the Boston Bank
of the Philippines in suburban Kalookan City.
   On Wednesday, small bombs also were exploded at the Coca-Cola
and Pepsi Cola bottling plants and another was defused at a factory
operated by Motorola, a U.S. electronics and communications firm.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS WISCONSIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This 60,000-ton battleship,
built in 1961, was sprouting grass from its desk just a few years
ago.
   Today, its 16-inch guns, the largest of their kind in the world,
are poised for any battle with Iraq, and the U.S. Navy is again
proud of this recommissioned vessel.
   At a change of command ceremony in the Persian Gulf, Rear Adm.
William M. Fogarty said Friday this ship provides ``a visible
reminder'' of the firepower facing Iraq.
   Fogarty, commander of the Middle East naval force that patrols
inside the gulf, was addressing 800 sailors grouped on the deck of
the USS Wisconsin.
   During the ceremony, Capt. David S. Bill III relieved Captain
Jerry M. Blesch as commanding officer of the ship. The change of
command is a routine procedure aboard U.S. warships, usually taking
place once every two years.
   ``The Wisconsin performs its mission today on the doorstep of an
aggressor. It is a constant, highly visible reminder of the peril
facing those who would ignore good faith efforts to resolve the
present crisis through peaceful means,'' Fogarty said.
   ``But should that warning not be heeded, and it becomes
necessary to actively translate our resolve into action, your
presence offers the naval component commander unparalleled
firepower,'' he said.
   Blesch, of Fort Thomas, Ky., was the Wisconsin's first
commanding officer after it was recommissioned in 1988. During the
ceremony Friday, he said, ``I was not impressed with her condition
when I first took her over.''
   He said there was grass growing on her deck, and he rememberd
saying at the time, ``I'd hate to be the guy to bring this thing
back to life.''
   Today the battleship is considered a force commander's dream.
   Its 16-inch guns can hit targets beyond 20 miles. The ship is
also equipped with 32 long-range Tomahawk cruise missles, 16
Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and 12 5-inch guns.
   The new commander, Bill, of Norfolk, Va., is a 1966 graduate of
the U.S. Naval Academy. His tours of duty have included commands in
Vietnam, the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Indian
Ocean.
   ``I am humbled by this awesome responsibility to take command of
one of the world's most impressive warships,'' he said Friday.
``But I hasten to add, I wouldn't trade places with anybody I
know.''

<HEAD>Whitney's Invention to Teach Children Importance of Manufacturing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The musket factory in which Eli Whitney
introduced mass production to the world has been reborn as a
working museum where children can learn the importance of
manufacturing by making toy soldiers.
   At the site where in 1798 the inventor began to beat his
competitors with the revolutionary production concept that helped
arm the federal government, the goal now is 25 toy soldiers
produced by 25 youngsters in 25 minutes.
   ``Ask me in a couple of weeks if we can do it,'' said William
Brown, director of the Eli Whitney Museum. The exhibit opened
Sunday.
   Whitney, fresh from a disappointing attempt to profit from his
cotton gin, set up the musket factory in a small barn along the
Mill River just north of New Haven.
   The museum thought a working exhibit would be the best way to
demonstrate Whitney's genius.
   ``Kids are taught that `factory' is a dirty word,'' Brown said.
``We wrongly equate factory work with degrading, repetitive labor.
Our goal is to help kids realize that this is a good and noble
tradition.''
   Twenty-two antique lathes, drill presses and other machines cut
and shape the 3-inch-tall toy soldiers. The machines were collected
from other museums, factories and machine shops throughout the
state.
   Whitney's mass production system - based on interchangeable
parts, the use of machine tools and the division of labor - made
possible levels of precision and productivity unheard of in his
day.
   Whitney's work paved the way for Connecticut's rise as a hub of
precision manufacturing, a legacy most children know little about,
Brown said.
   ``The experience of producing something collectively has become
as foreign to these children as ballet or opera,'' Brown said. ``In
the last 20 or 30 years, we've moved away from teaching anything
about manufacturing. That's a horrible mistake.''
   Whitney's muskets were followed by Colt's revolvers - the
legendary ``gun that won the West'' - and locks, clocks,
typewriters and sewing machines. Today, jet engines, nuclear
submarines and helicopters are made in Connecticut, along with Colt
guns.
   But manufacturing has tapered off since 1943, when 507,000
workers in the state - 63 percent of the Connecticut work force -
were employed. Now only 22 percent of the work force, or 350,000
out of 1.6 million jobs, are in manufacturing.
   Over the next nine months, the museum hopes to send as many as
25,000 students and other visitors home with toy soldiers - and
even more importantly, with a better understanding and new
appreciation of manufacturing.
   Peter Moanfeldt, a professor of mechanical engineering at
Greater New Haven State Technical College, said the project
addresses what he sees as a fundamental problem that threatens the
health of the U.S. economy.
   ``We need people who are willing to go into plants and do
work,'' he said. ``And we're not turning out people who have that
mind set. We're turning out people who want to sit in glassed-in
offices and run the plants.
   ``We can't become a nation of bosses,'' Moanfeldt said.

   Hundreds of Sri Lankans who fled the
Persian Gulf crisis sang traditional songs and waved as a chartered
ship bringing them from Jordan docked at Colombo today.
   The Safina E-Arab, a Pakistani vessel, sailed from Aqaba, Jordan
on Sept. 17 with 1,756 Sri Lankans on board. They had fled Iraq and
Kuwait after Baghdad invaded the desert emirate on Aug. 2 and
reached Jordan after journeying across the desert.
   ``In my life, it was the worst suffering I ever had to
undergo,'' said Mohamed Uvaisa Hammed, a 24-year-old driver who was
working in Kuwait.
   He said he left Kuwait on Aug. 31 on a bus along with 54 other
Sri Lankans. They traveled to Baghdad and then to Jordan, where
they stayed at a refugee camp before leaving for Aqaba and boarding
the ship, he said.
   The ship was chartered by International Organization Migration,
a United Nations-funded refugee agency.
   The refugees sang Sinhalese songs and waved and were given a
ceremonial welcome near the port. Names of those who returned were
announced on loudspeakers for the throngs of waiting relatives and
friends.
   An old woman burst into tears when she realized her two
daughters, who were working in Kuwait, were not among the evacuees.
   At least 100,000 Sri Lankans were employed in Kuwait at the time
of the Iraqi invasion. About 60,000 remain, another 20,000 have
returned home and the rest are on their way, foreign office
officials say.
   Hundreds of Americans are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``We hope to evacuate all Sri Lankans before the end of the
month,'' said Labor Minister Gamalath Premachandra. He said the Sri
Lankan government was trying to organize daily flights from Jordan
and would request Iraq permit flights from Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   Rape charges against two Naval Academy
midshipmen come at a time when the male-dominated institution is
trying to rid the campus of sexual harassment.
   Academy students Melvyn Malcolm Davis and Gordon Scott Wilson,
both 21, were charged Friday with rape and related charges after a
woman told police she met them at an Annapolis bar and accepted
their offer of a ride home, Annapolis police spokesman Dermott
Hickey said.
   ``They took her to an unknown location in the city and she was
taken inside where she was raped and then they took her back to
whatever street she lived on,'' Hickey said.
   The midshipmen also allegedly forced the woman to perform oral
sex, Hickey said.
   Lt. Commander Michael John, an academy spokesman, said the
charges are criminal charges rather than military charges. The
academy will take no immediate action against the midshipmen, he
said.
   Naval and congressional inquiries into sexual harassment and
student hazing at the academy began earlier this year after the
resignation of second-year midshipmen Gwen Marie Dreyer. She told
authorities male midshipmen dragged her from her room, handcuffed
her to a urinal and snapped photographs.
   Other women midshipmen later said they also had been subjected
to abuse by male officers and male students.
   In May, the academy toughened its rules, increasing the penalty
for midshipman found guilty of physical abuse of a plebe to
expulsion. Previously, midshipmen were expelled for the more
narrowly defined offense of hazing.
   A Navy survey found 46 percent of female midshipmen and 31
percent of male midshipmen thought the 4,500-student academy had a
problem with sexual harassment.
   Dreyer quit the academy in April to protest the punishment meted
out to two male midshipmen. They were penalized with loss of leave
time and demerits and six others were issued written reprimands.

<HEAD>U.S. Announces First Cambodian Aid in 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has signed agreements
to provide $2 million to meet child health care needs in Cambodia,
the first U.S. aid to that country in 15 years.
   Friday's announcement by the U.S. Agency for International
Development came on the eve of a meeting today between Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach. It was a further signal of the improving relations between
the United States and Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government.
   The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Vision
Relief and Development will administer the funds.
   A.I.D. said the UNICEF program involves immunizations, oral
re-hydration, nutrition and health education.
   World Vision will receive an $800,000 grant to upgrade a
pediatric hospital in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital.
   U.S. aid to Cambodia was suspended after the communist Khmer
Rouge triumph there in 1975. Congress recently lifted a legal
prohibition on such aid.
   Administration officials have recently expanded diplomatic
contacts with both Hanoi and Phnom Penh out of concern that the
Khmer Rouge rebel group might force its way back into power.
   The Khmer Rouge is widely accused of killing hundreds of
thousands during its 3{-year rule in the 1970's.
   Also Friday, a $9.8 million humanitarian aid agreement was
signed with the president of the Soviet Republic of Armenia.
   It was described as the first A.I.D. program in the Soviet
Union. But the United States provided substantial assistance to
Armenia following the December 1988 earthquake there.

<HEAD>House-Adopted NASA Bill Includes Money for Moon, Mars Trips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to place a
settlement on the Moon and begin work on a manned expedition to
Mars was included in a House-passed $44 billion, three-year
spending authorization bill for NASA.
   The measure, adopted Friday, would allow the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to spend no money for the Moon
and Mars programs in the next fiscal year, but the agency could
spend $444 million to begin the efforts in fiscal 1992 and $649
million in fiscal 1993.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote after a brief debate, now
goes to a conference committee to work out differences with the
Senate.
   The bill's three-year spending authorization is designed to
allow NASA to make longer-range plans, including space shuttle
missions, space exploration and development of expendable launch
vehicles and an experimental high-speed aerospace plane.
   A multi-year authorization bill was adopted by the House last
year, but the Senate never took action.
   President Bush proposed last year that NASA establish a
permanent settlement on the Moon and begin a 30-year project to
send a manned expedition to Mars by the year 2019. The bill
authorizes the Bush administration's request for the project's
start.

<HEAD>Kemp Applauds First Public Housing Sale Accolade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of a public housing project here are
the first residents of federally subsidized housing units in the
nation to purchase their complex.
   The Kenilworth-Parkside development in the city's northeast
quadrant was transferred to the residents on Friday for $1. The
transaction capped a five-year process in which the residents
successfully managed the complex and qualified to purchase the
property under a program boosted by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp.
   ``The residents have worked so hard over the past five years to
make this possible. This can open the door for residents of other
public housing complexes across the country who'd like to have a
definite say about their living conditions,'' said Kimi Gray, head
of the Kenilworth-Parkside Resident Management Corp.
   The first phase of the changeover included the transfer of 132
housing units to the management corporation. The remaining 332
units are to be exchanged as renovations are completed.
   A study by an independent accounting firm showed the program
would save the government $6 million over 10 years and $26 million
over 40 years.
   The sale was made possible in part by amendments to the 1987
Housing Act, which gave resident councils the right to manage their
own developments.

<HEAD>Jews Thinking of Gulf Crisis on Their Holiest Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jews celebrated their holiest day today after a
televised message from their chief rabbi, who told them to pray and
fear no enemy - ``not even the ruler of Baghdad.''
   Israel shut itself off from the outside world Friday as Jews
began observances of the Yom Kippur holiday with fasting and
prayers of penitence.
   Although most Israelis are non-observant Jews, Yom Kippur is
widely observed. Holiday services were held at the nation's 7,000
synagogues from sundown Friday until sundown today.
   With tensions high as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, many
Israelis were mindful that Friday also marked the 17th anniversary
of the 1973 Middle East war, which began with attacks by the
Egyptian and Syrian armies during Yom Kippur.
   In a holiday address on television Friday, Chief Rabbi Mordechai
Eliyahu made a reference to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who has
threatened to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
   Eliayahu said Israelis should pray to God, for ``then we have
nothing to fear from any enemy ... even the ruler of Baghdad,''
whose capture of Kuwait last month caused a massive buildup of U.S.
and other forces in Saudi Arabia.
   For some of the 90,000 Soviet immigrants who have arrived in the
past year, this will be the first Yom Kippur they will be allowed
to observe with prayers.
   All traffic halted at dusk Friday, airports closed and border
crossing points were shut until tonight. Even the non-observant
Jews refrain from driving for fear of being stoned by religious
zealots.
   The nation's chief rabbis appealed to the public not to stone
ambulances or cars that may be on the road for an emergency.
   By midafternoon Friday, the state-run Israel radio and
television and army radio ceased broadcasts to follow the tradition
of silence and reflection during the holiday.
   Jews traditionally fast during the 24 hours; restaurants in
Israel must shut down by law. Observant Jews beat their chests and
ask forgiveness for sins committed during the past year.
   This year, as in the past, the army has barred Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Israel during
the holiday. The Palestinians have been waging a 34-month-long
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
   Israeli newspapers printed reminiscences and commentaries about
the 1973 war, and many families placed notices in newspapers
memorializing some of the nearly 2,700 soldiers who died.
   Early Friday, some Orthodox Jews went to the markets to carry
out the ancient rite of kapparot. Waving live chickens over their
heads, they prayed that their sins would be transferred to the
sacrificial chicken. Afterwards, the chickens were slaughtered and
given to the poor.
   Yom Kippur ends the 10-day ``days of awe'' that begin on Rosh
Hashana, the Jewish New Year.

<HEAD>Teachers Continue Nation's Longest School Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUKILTEO, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers in the year's longest school
strike voted overwhelmingly to defy a judge's order to report to
work Monday.
   ``If we give in now we'll lose our collective bargaining rights,
not only in this district but in surrounding districts and all over
the state,'' union leader Judith Prinz said after teachers decided
Friday to continue their strike.
   Only 65 of 387 Mukilteo teachers who voted were in favor of
returning to work, said John Cahill, a spokesman for the Washington
Education Association, a statewide teacher's union.
   Today was the 31st day of the contract dispute, making it the
longest teachers' strike in Washington history and the longest in
the nation this year.
   Teachers walked out Aug. 30. Classes were originally scheduled
to begin Sept. 5 for the district's 9,100 students. Bargaining was
set to resume Sunday.
   Superior Court Judge Stuart C. French ruled the strike illegal
Thursday. He said teachers could be fined $100 and the Mukilteo
Education Association $500 for each day the walkout continues.
   Under the ruling, the school board directed teachers to return
to work Monday and set Tuesday as the first day of classes.
   ``We want to be there for the kids. We would like to be there
for the parents, but we have our rights,'' teacher Elsie Miller
said.
   Another Washington teacher strike ended Friday with a vote by
teachers to ratify a contract in the University Place School
District, which has about 4,600 students in the Tacoma suburbs.
   That strike began Sept. 19. Classes were to resume Monday.
   Teacher strikes have been scattered around the country. The
nation's largest continues in New Orleans. Some 4,420 teachers and
1,100 teachers' aides and secretaries walked out Sept. 17, but
schools have been kept open with substitutes and more than 1,600
regular teachers who crossed picket lines.
   About 470 teachers work in the predominantly white,
working-class Mukilteo School District. The district includes the
town of Mukilteo, much of southwest Everett and the suburbs around
the Boeing 747 and 767 assembly plant.
   Major issues include: class size; assignment, transfer and
vacancy policies; teacher involvement in decision-making at the
schoolhouse level, and pay for extra time, responsibility and
incentives.
   Fairmount PTA president Marilyn Cole said her fourth-grade son
was following the strike closely.
   ``Andrew has asked some really penetrating questions ... `Why
wouldn't the teachers go back to school if the court orders them
to?'
   ``I told him, `They feel very strongly about what they're
doing,' '' she said. ``He came back and said, `Well, if a bank
robber said he felt very strongly about what he was doing, the
judge wouldn't let him off the hook.'
   ``I just said, `We'll talk about that a little more some other
time.' ''

   Here are some facts about the united
Germany that will be created when West Germany and East Germany
unite on Oct. 3.
  
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NAME: Federal Republic of Germany.
   POPULATION: 61 million in West Germany plus 16.6 million in East
Germany, for a total of 77.6 million people.
   SIZE: West Germany's 95,975 square miles plus East Germany's
41,768 square miles. Total: 137,743 square miles, or more than half
the size of Texas.
   NATIONAL FLAG: The West German flag, with broad horizontal
black, red, and gold stripes, with no emblem.
   NATIONAL ANTHEM: West Germany's current national hymn, which is
part of a poem called ``Deutschlandlied,'' or ``German Song.'' It
uses a melody written by Franz Josef Haydn in 1797. Its opening
words are ``Unity, and justice and freedom...''
   CURRENCY: The two Germanys joined their economies on July 1.
Since then West Germany's deutsche mark has been the official
currency across Germany, as will be the case after unity.
   STATES: Five East German states added to West Germany's 11.
   CAPITAL: Berlin becomes the capital of all Germany on unity day.
Bonn will remain the seat of government, with an all-German
Parliament to decide whether the government will be moved to
Berlin.
   GOVERNMENT: Helmut Kohl, West Germany's chancellor, becomes
leader of all Germany on unity day and remains in power until
elections to choose a new government and Parliament. The balloting
was set for Dec. 2 but a West German court today struck down the
election law, which excludes smaller parties. The action could
force postponement of the election until a new plan is agreed on.
Kohl is being challenged by Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine in the
Dec. 2 elections.

   The first of thousands of British ground troops
and military hardware were on their way to Saudi Arabia today to
join U.S. and other forces facing the Iraqi army in the Arabian
desert.
   Several hundred troops left by air Friday from bases in southern
England and Germany. The 5,800-ton logistical landing ship Sir
Tristram sailed Friday night from Marchwood military port in
southern England with 80 soldiers and equipment.
   The airborne troops were mostly advance parties from engineer
units, the Defense Ministry said in a statement Friday that
detailed the monthlong operation.
   The statement Friday said today's schedule included movement of
Challenger tanks by road transporters from the 7th Armored
Brigade's base at Fallingbostel in northern Germany to the North
Sea German port of Bremerhaven 65 miles away.
   Initial estimates put the number of troops of the 7th Armored
Brigade and support units being sent to the Persian Gulf at between
6,000 and 8,000. But The Times of London today said the number
could reach 9,000.
   Three thousand other British armed service personnel aboard
ships or with Royal Air Force fighter units are already in the gulf
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The United States has sent about 165,000 soldiers to the Persian
Gulf region to ward off any Iraqi southern advance into Saudi
Arabia. Thousands of Arab and French troops also are dug into the
Saudi desert.
   The Pentagon said this week that Iraq had boosted its forces to
430,000 in and around Kuwait.
   Scores of U.S., British and other warships have assembled in the
region to enforce a U.N.-ordered embargo against Iraq.
   The British Foreign Ministry has chartered 15 civilian ships and
several civilian jumbo jets to assist British military ships and
aircraft involved in the new deployment.
   Britain's shipments of military hardware, expected to arrive in
the Persian Gulf in about three weeks, are to include 500 British
combat vehicles and of more than 2,000 support vehicles, 10,000
tons of ammunition and 22,000 tons of other stores, spares, rations
and medical supplies.
   Transportation of the entire 7th Armored Brigade is scheduled to
be completed by the end of October and the brigade will be ready
for action by mid-November, the ministry said.

   Lawrence F. O'Brien, an architect of John F.
Kennedy's New Frontier and later commissioner of the National
Basketball Association at the dawn of free agency, has died at age
73.
   O'Brien, who influenced Democratic politics for two decades,
died Thursday of cancer at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center.
   The Kennedy family confidant was a ``founding father of post-war
politics,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass, said Friday. ``He was
the organizational genius of my brother's presidential campaign and
the architect of much of the New Frontier.''
   O'Brien served as congressional liaison for President Kennedy
and President Lyndon B. Johnson, was postmaster general under
Johnson for three years and twice served as chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.
   O'Brien's Democratic Party office was broken into in
Washington's Watergate complex in 1972, setting off a scandal that
toppled President Nixon.
   ``Larry was one of the last of the old-time political leaders
who had no factional or philosophical disputes with any member of
the party and was interested primarily in winning elections,'' said
Theodore Sorensen, former special counsel to President Kennedy.
   O'Brien was with Kennedy when the president was assassinated in
Dallas in 1963. O'Brien also was with Sen. Robert F. Kennedy when
he was assassinated in Los Angeles in 1968 during his Democratic
primary bid for president.
   O'Brien left politics in 1972 for Wall Street, then was named
NBA commissioner in 1975, a year when free agency and big money
were reshaping professional sports. He retired as commissioner in
1984.
   Born in Springfield, Mass., O'Brien thought as a boy about
running for office but became more interested in behind-the-scenes
politics.
   ``All I wanted to do was get more votes than the other guy,''
O'Brien once said.
   O'Brien directed John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign and his
earlier U.S. Senate upset of Henry Cabot Lodge, who was the symbol
of Protestant Republicanism in Massachusetts.
   At the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles, O'Brien's
delegate count was so accurate that he predicted within a half-vote
the final tally in favor of Kennedy. It was O'Brien's greatest
triumph.
   Survivors include his wife, Elva Brassard O'Brien; a son,
Lawrence F. O'Brien III of Washington; two grandsons, and a sister,
Mary Placzek of Wilbraham, Mass.
   Wakes were scheduled for Sunday in New York and Monday in
Springfield. The funeral was set for Tuesday at St. Michael's
Cathedral in Springfield.

   The government has indicated it may
have to raise taxes because of the Persian Gulf crisis, and it
unveiled a $16.4 billion borrowing plan to help finance the growing
costs of German unity.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel also presented a new $12.8 billion
supplementary budget Friday. Most was earmarked for helping East
Germany.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has doggedly rejected opposition claims
that he will eventually have to raise taxes to finance unification,
scheduled for Wednesday. But government officials have been hinting
taxes may go up.
   Waigel told reporters, ``Through strict spending discipline, we
will do everything to avoid raising taxes.''
   Asked how Germany will pay for its contributions to help ease
the gulf crisis, he replied that ``the exclusion'' of a possible
tax increase is ``limited to German unity.''
   Kohl has pledged $2.1 billion to help the anti-Iraqi effort. The
sum includes equipment for U.S. forces deployed in Saudi Arabia and
assistance for nations like Jordan that are suffering from a loss
of trade.
   Raising taxes for gulf assistance would let Kohl technically
keep his word that Germans won't face a tax increase because of
unity.
   Kohl's political rivals have charged the chancellor is trying to
hide the true costs of unification so voters won't turn against him
in all-German elections.
   The vote had been set for Dec. 2, but West Germany's
constitutional court ruled today that the plan is illegal because
it keeps smaller parties off the ballot. That could force
postponement of the balloting unless political leaders agree on a
new procedure.
   Waigel called the news conference Friday to unveil the
supplementary budget, which would raise total outlays for this year
to $252 billion.
   The extra borrowing that he announced increases 1990 total to
about $42 billion.
   The added borrowing would cover new outlays earmarked for
helping rebuild what is now East Germany after unification.
   Higher-than-expected unity costs have already forced Kohl's
government to adopt two previous supplementary budgets.
   The latest budget addition includes extra money for the creation
of new jobs in East Germany, which is suffering from heavy
unemployment as antiquated businesses collapse in the new
free-market system. It also provides more funds for housing,
jobless benefits, pensions and health insurance.

   Sidestepping Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the Russian Republic has asked Israel to form direct
economic ties, Russian and Israeli legislators say.
   The Israelis said Friday they would consider the request but
don't want to jeopardize the big prize - eventual renewal of ties
with the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev is seeking better relations with Israel and more
investment in the troubled Soviet economy. But he would probably be
angered by a special deal between Jerusalem and the Russian
Republic led by his chief rival, Boris Yeltsin.
   ``We will act carefully, and I emphasize that,'' said Eliyahu
Ben-Elissar, chairman of the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee
in Israel's Parliament.
   ``We can't endanger all that is going on between us and the
central authorities of the Soviet Union,'' he told Israel radio.
   He was referring to the warming of ties between the two
countries in the past three years. There are growing indications
that diplomatic relations could be restored in the near future.
   The offer of direct ties with the Russian Republic came from
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the
republic's Parliament. In a message to his Israeli counterpart,
Ben-Elissar, Lukin said he was interestd in forming close working
relations between the two committees, the Israeli legislator said.
   But Lukin suggested in an interview with Israel radio broadcast
Friday that the real objective would be economic cooperation.
   ``The idea of exchanging delegations between the foreign affairs
committees of the two parliaments is in the works. But the most
important area is economics,'' Lukin said.
   Russia, the Soviet Union's wealthiest, largest and most populous
republic, has adopted a radical economic reform plan. It is
scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1.
   The central Soviet government, meanwhile, is working out details
of a somewhat more conservative plan for leading to nation toward a
free-market system.
   ``The Russian Republic has something to offer to Israel, and we
are interested in your technologies,'' Lukin told the radio,
speaking in Russian.
   ``Based on our radical economic program, all are invited to
trade, to establish joint factories. But many Israelis would have a
competitive edge because they know Russia and its language,'' he
said.
   Lukin assured the Israelis that they wouldn't harm their chances
with Gorbachev by developing ties with the Russian Republic, which
has been seeking greater independence from the central government.
   Ben-Elissar said several months ago he asked the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's Parliament, to
establish working ties, but that he didn't receive an answer.
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic relations with Israel after the
Jewish state conquered territory of Moscow's Arab allies during the
1967 Middle East War.

   China is still holding hundreds of prisoners
detained during last year's crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement, a U.S.-based human rights group says,
   The group, Asia Watch, on Friday issued the most comprehensive
list to date of prisoners of conscience held in Chinese jails.
   Most of the 1,000 prisoners profiled in the report were arrested
after the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators on June
4, 1989.
   Sidney Jones, executive director of the New York-based
organization, said the aim of the report was to keep the prisoners
from being forgotten.
   ``We are concerned that human rights in China as an issue is
going to fade from public view. ... We want to make sure that these
names become very much in the public eye,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   Asia Watch also hopes the report will help gain the release of
those listed, she said.
   The group planned to try to give a copy to Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen when he attends the United Nations General
Assembly in New York.
   The Chinese government did not immediately respond to the
report. It generally rejects criticism of its rights record as
interference in its internal affairs.
   Thousands of Chinese nationwide were detained or arrested
immediately after last year's student-led democracy movement was
put down.
   The Asia Watch report lists the names and backgrounds of those
whose cases are known. It also enumerates other arrests and
executions reported by the official Chinese media without giving
names.
   Only 226 of the 1,000 prisoners in the report have been tried.
Sixty-seven were sentenced to death or executed.
   Called ``Repression in China Since June 4, 1989,'' the report is
far more comprehensive than those issued previously by Asia Watch
and other international rights groups.
   It includes people from every segment of society - students,
intellectuals, peasants, workers, and government officials - from
all 29 of China's provinces and regions.
   ``The focus has been on Beijing when people think about (the
crackdown), but it's been widespread throughout China,'' Jones
said.
   The government has announced the release of 881 people in
Beijing and Shanghai the past year, but it has refused to say how
many remain in jail nationwide for political offenses.
   Among those named in the report are such well-known figures as
Liu Xiaobo. He is a literary critic who was on a fellowship at
Columbia University when the democracy movement began, and he
rushed back to China to take part.
   The report mentions Wang Dan, the bookish student who became one
of the main protest leaders. He has been held in solitary
confinement in a maximum-security prison outside Beijing.
   The report also includes hundreds of other people who were
caught up in the pro-democracy protests that spread to more than 80
cities throughout China.
   The report also includes dozens of Tibetans and Moslems
imprisoned for separatist activities, and Christians arrested for
conducting religious activities outside the state-run churches.
   Asia Watch plans to present the report to Congress next week
during a hearing on a bill that would link future renewal of
China's most-favored-nation trade status to its rights record,
Jones said.
   President Bush extended China's preferential status for one year
in June. Some legislators criticized his decision, but it is not
expected to be overturned.

<HEAD>East German Prisoners Protest Amnesty Plan; Youths Rampage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesting inmates today seized prison
rooftops nationwide and rioters clashed with police in the capital
as East Germany braced for growing unrest in its final days as a
nation.
   About 60 inmates occupied the roof of a prison in Dresden to
demonstrate against a plan passed by the Parliament late Friday
that would trim their sentences by a third.
   A 19-year-old man made good on a threat to jump and leaped from
a 9-foot ledge, East Germany's ADN news agency said. The inmate was
slightly injured.
   ADN said inmates also occupied rooftops in Buetzow and Leipzig.
Prisoners have been mounting periodic protests for weeks over the
amnesty plan.
   Exempt from the prisoner amnesty plan are people convicted of
murer, war crimes, sex offenses and other violent crimes.
   The convicts want a broader amnesty program. Many claim they
were falsely imprisoned under the former Communist regime.
   The amnesty plan passed by Parliament was one of the
legislature's last official acts before it formally disbands on
Tuesday, one day before East Germany is absorbed by West Germany.
   Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel spoke to the Dresden
inmates for several hours early this morning, ADN said.
   In East Berlin, authorities arrested 15 people after hundreds of
young people rampaged Friday night through East Berlin's main
square, Alexanderplatz, following a soccer match between Berlin and
Leipzig teams.
   The rioters attacked passersby, hurled rocks in a train station
and clashed with club-wielding police. But no injuries were
reported.
   The rampage was the latest of several in East Berlin, which has
become increasingly violent since the borders to the West were
opened.
   Neo-Nazi skinheads, leftist radicals from West Berlin and bands
of self-proclaimed toughs with no political loyalties except to
soccer teams routinely stage rampages in the city center.
   Police have been preparing for organized attacks by leftist
radicals who have promised to mount protests this weekend over
Wednesday's unification of Germany.
   Also Friday night, a group of club-wielding skinheads in the
city of Saalfeld rampaged through a youth clubhouse and injured two
people, ADN said.

   West Germany's constitutional
court ruled today that plans for united German elections in
December are illegal because they keep smaller parties off the
ballot.
   The ruling does not affect the unification of East Germany and
West Germany that comes on Wednesday. But it will force political
leaders to seek a new election plan or perhaps postpone the united
elections planned for Dec 2.
   West German Justice Minister Hans Engelhard said today his
government will try to keep the Dec. 2 election date in place but
also respect the decision of the constitutional court.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be in charge of a united
Germany until the common elections are held.
   The constitutional court acted on a complaint brought by East
Germany's former Communist Party, the environmental Greens
coalition, and the far-right Republicans.
   Hans Christian Stroebele, spokesman for the Greens, hailed the
court's decision. He called it ``sweet success against the
arrogance of the cocky dominant parties.''
   The smaller parties have opposed the election agreement between
mainstream political groups because it required a party to win 5
percent of the vote across a united Germany in order to win a seat
in Parliament.
   The election treaty would allow smaller parties to form
alliances with larger parties and share ballot space with them,
allowing them to get the necessary 5 percent.
   But the former Communists and the rightist Republicans have
virtually no chance of finding mainstream parties that would share
the ballot with them.
   The court's decision was announced by Ernst Gottfried
Mahrenholz, vice president of the constitutional court in
Karlsruhe, near the French border 80 miles south of Frankfurt.
   He said the 5 percent clause in the election agreement would
infringe on the rights of the parties that brought the complaint.
   The court also struck down the mechanism that would allow
smaller parties to be listed with larger, allied parties.
   The agreement rejected by the court represented a compromise
between the Kohl's Christian Democrats, which is the leading party
in both Germanys, and the main opposition group - the
left-of-center Social Democrats.
   The Social Democrats wanted the 5 percent limit to keep smaller,
left-of-center parties from getting in Parliament and diluting the
Social Democrats' clout in a united Germany.
   The Christian Democrats wanted the agreement that would allow
bigger parties to form alliances with smaller parties because
Kohl's power base is comprised of coalitions with other
conservative parties, such as the powerful Christian Social Union
in Germany's biggest state, Bavaria.

   Leftist rebels killed a rural activist for
President Alberto Fujimori's party during a flurry of guerrilla
violence around the nation, police said.
   At least four police and eight Maoist Shining Path guerrillas
also died Friday in clashes.
   In Pucura, an Andean town 120 miles east of Lima, about 10
Shining Path rebels stormed the home ofHugo Hidalgo, a local
representative of Fujimori's Change 90 party. Hidalgo was shot
twice in the head during the attack late Thursday, police said.
   Early Friday, four police and six rebels were killed when
guerrillas ambushed a police patrol in a mountainous area about 525
miles southeast of Lima.
   Police said about 70 rebels attacked a 25-man patrol traveling
in two vehicles. Two officers were wounded.
   In addition, two leftist guerrillas were killed by police in a
dawn gun battle in the Lima suburb of Surco, police said.
   They said they recovered dynamite, fuses, revolvers and
ammunition from a stolen car used by the rebels. The guerrillas
were planning to use the stolen vehicle as a car bomb, police said.
   Guerrillas also bombed three state electricity company branches
in Lima early Friday morning, police said.
   The outbreak of violence follows the Shining Path's
assassination of former Labor Minister Orestes Rodriguez in Lima
one week ago.
   Members of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a
smaller group, kidnapped Congressman Gerardo Lopez in Lima on
Sunday. Lopez is still being held.
   Nearly 20,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980. The
Tupac Amaru band began operating in 1984.

<HEAD>Shuttle Pad to be Converted for Titan 4-Centaur Launches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force has decided to convert a
mothballed $3.5 billion space shuttle dock into a backup pad for
launches of the Titan 4-Centaur rocket.
   The Pentagon said Friday the multimillion dollar conversion of
Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base will start
after Oct. 1.
   The first launch of Titan 4 rockets equipped with Centaur
upper-stage boosters at the pad is expected in 1996, the Pentagon
said.
   The Air Force believes the pad is needed in case an accident
ever cripples Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex-4 East, which will
be used early next year for the first West Coast launch of a Titan
4 without a Centaur upper stage, Col. Charles F. Sterling, Titan 4
program director, said in a statement.
   Sterling cited the 1985 explosion of a Titan 34D rocket that
temporarily halted use of another launch pad.
   But a critic predicted the pad will never be used because
Congress will refuse to pay for the costly military communications
and surveillance satellites meant to be launched on Titan
4-Centaurs.
   ``They've been working on this launch pad for more than two
decades and it still hasn't launched anything,'' space policy
analyst John Pike said Friday by telephone from the Federation of
American Scientists, a public interest group in Washington. ``They
just want to keep pouring concrete.''
   The conversion of SLC-6 will cost $300 million to $500 million,
and will be faster, cheaper and environmently safer than building a
new launch complex for up to $800 million, said Maj. Tom Worsdale,
a Vandenberg spokesman.
   Pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more. He said
the decision ``effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from
California.''
   The cost of Titan 4 and Titan 4-Centaurs ranges from $173
million to $265 million each, according to various Air Force and
General Accounting Office estimates.

   Bongo, an African gorilla who played a
major role in breeding gorillas in captivity, has died of a lung
infection at Columbus Zoo, officials say.
   Bongo's keepers found the 33-year-old silverback dead Friday in
his quarters.
   ``If there was ever a gentle giant, it was Bongo,'' zoo Director
Jack Hanna said. ``He was a major factor in helping us bring this
zoo to where it is and an important contributor to the North
American captive gorilla population.''
   For 26 years, Bongo romanced Colo, the world's first
captive-born gorilla. Bongo sired Oscar and Toni, who live in the
zoo. In 1986, Bongo became the oldest breeding male in captivity
with the birth of his son, Fossey, zoo officials said.
   When Fossey's mother, Bridgette, died 14 months after the birth,
Bongo took on the rearing of the young gorilla, often cradling it
in his arms.
   Bongo was about a year old when he was brought to America from
Africa, where he was captured in the wild.

   Britain today sent ground forces to the Persian Gulf, and Iraq's
foreign minister arrived in Jordan carrying a message from
President Saddam Hussein.
   Baghdad's government threatened to spread any war across the
region, and talk of war also came from Washington.
   Following a meeting Friday between President Bush and Kuwait's
deposed emir, a presidential aide suggested Bush might push for
tougher U.N. action against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, including
a military operation.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
said he feels the Bush administration ``is looking more favorably
on an early war option'' to end Saddam's 8-week-old occupation of
oil-rich Kuwait.
   So far, tough U.N. sanctions and a naval blockade that has
choked off virtually all of Iraq's oil exports and food imports
have failed to break Saddam's resolve to absorb the emirate.
   The Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, was meeting today with
Jordan's King Hussein. The message he brought from Saddam dealt
with the ``tense situation'' in the region, a senior Jordanian
Foreign Ministry official said.
   Jordan has also condemned the invasion of Kuwait, but Saddam has
widespread popular support in Jordan, and the Jordanian government
has spoken out strongly against foreign military intervention in
the region.
   The pace of the multinational deployment picked up today.
Egyptian military sources said about 1,000 Egyptian soldiers left
by ship for Saudi Arabia. The reinforcements will bring to about
12,500 the number of Egyptian troops in the region.
   Meanwhile, British ground forces were to begin leaving Britain
and Germany today for the Persian Gulf, the Defense Ministry said
in London.
   The first of 500 British combat vehicles and of more than 2,000
support vehicles, 10,000 tons of ammunition and 22,000 tons of
other stores, spares, rations and medical supplies left the North
Sea German port of Bremerhaven on two ships on Friday, the ministry
said.
   The 5,800-ton logistical landing ship Sir Tristram, meanwhile,
sailed Friday night from Marchwood military port in southern
England carrying 80 soldiers, equipment, spares and food, the
ministry said.
   Advanced parties of several hundred men, mostly belonging to
army engineering units, set off by air on Friday from bases in
southern England and West Germany, the British Defense Ministry
said.
   The ministry said that loading of equipment on to ships in
Germany and Britain began Friday and will last a week. The cargo is
to arrive in the gulf in three weeks.
   Initial estimates put the number of troops from the 7th Armored
Brigade and support units at between 6,000 and 8,000. But The Times
of London said today the number could reach 9,000.
   About 3,000 British forces are already serving aboard ships or
with Royal Air Force fighter units as part of the international
military buildup opposing Iraq.
   The United States has led the international forces with more
than 150,000 soldiers on ships and on the ground in Saudi Arabia,
facing an estimated 430,000 Iraqi troops in and around Kuwait.
   Iraq invaded its southern neighbor Aug. 2 after a dispute over
land, oil and money, and increased its share of world crude
reserves to 20 percent.
   Iraq's government newspaper Al-Jomhouriya again warned about
widespread devastation if war broke out. ``The battle arenas would
be multiple and the fires would devour all oil fields, the Zionist
entity and agents of America in the region,'' it said in an
editorial.
   The newspaer was referring to Israel as well as Egypt, Syria,
Morocco, and Arab gulf states cooperating with the United States in
the multinational buildup.
   The Iraqi News Agency said radical Palestinian leader Mohammed
Abbas vowed to launch terrorist attacks on U.S. interests if any
Iraqi aircraft were attacked to enforce a new U.N. air embargo on
Iraq.
   In Irbid, Jordan, about 50,000 people rallied Friday in support
of Iraq. During the demonstration, the fundamentalist Moslem
Brotherhood Party vowed to fight all the Western troops in Saudi
Arabia if Iraq was attacked.
   ``Moslems will kill all American and Western troops who are
dirtying our Holy land, and their corpses will be sent home in
black bags addressed to Bush,'' party member Sheik Abdul Munem Abu
Zant declared.
   In Tehran, millions of Iranians on Friday protested the
multinational force in the Persian Gulf with chants of ``Death to
America!'' according to Tehran radio.
   In Washington, Bush promised the exiled leader of Kuwait that
the oil-rich kingdom will not remain under Iraqi control.
   ``Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity will be
restored,'' Bush said after meeting with Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah.
   A Bush aide said the account of the Iraqi occupation that the
exiled ruler gave Bush could lead the president to push for tougher
U.N. action against Saddam, including U.N.-backed military action.
   ``That's one of those things that's conceivable,'' said Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
   More than 1,700 Sri Lankans who fled Iraq and Kuwait sang
traditional songs and waved as a chartered ship arrived home today
via Jordan, where thousands of Asian refugees have been stranded in
camps.
   The ship was chartered by International Organization Migration,
a United Nations-funded refugee agency.
   Thousands of Westerners, including hundreds of Americans,
remained trapped in the Iraq and Kuwait. Scores of men are being
held at potential military targets as human shields.
   In other developments:
   -Turkish customs officials at the southern port of Mersin have
refused to unload Iraqi-bound chemicals from a Polish ship after
receiving a tip they constitute raw materials for mustard gas, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency reported Friday.
   U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia have been preparing for possible
chemical attacks by Iraq.
   -Four East European countries have offered help in countering
Iraq, the U.S. State Department said Friday. Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Romania have offered medical facilities, and Bulgaria pledged
400 soldiers, the department said.

funding of the Boy Scouts of America, reversing a decision to cut
off funds because of allegations that the scouts' oath
discriminated against atheists.
   The board voted 8-1 late Friday to resume the $1,250
contribution it had voted down Aug. 29, said Joan Hendricks, a
board member for the Genoa-Kingston United Way and a member of
American Atheists Inc.
   ``The accusation of discrimination has yet to be fully decided
by the courts,'' board Chairman Jim Ferris said in a statement late
Friday.
   Hendricks cast the only dissenting vote but denied that the
cutoff of funds had originally been her idea.
   The decision to withhold 1991 funding from two local Boy Scout
troops and a Cub Scout pack made it the only United Way among 1,400
agencies nationwide to take such action, the national association
said Wednesday.
   A lawsuit filed in May in U.S. District Court in Chicago
challenged the requirement that scouts take an oath to do their
duy ``to God and my country.''
   United Way of America officials have said the organization would
not change its policy of funding the scouts until their was a legal
decision.

   The Berlin Wall guard post at Checkpoint
Charlie was handed over to a German museum today for future
exhibition to the public, and it was lauded as a ``symbol of the
American support for a free life.''
   ``In the course of its 29-year existence, Checkpoint Charlie
witnessed acts of courage and acts of desperation,'' said Maj. Gen.
Raymond E. Haddock, the commander of U.S. forces in West Berlin.
   The post, which stood between the American and Soviet sectors of
Berlin, ``provided constant, visible proof of Allied determination
to maintain their freedom of movement in all of Berlin and to
defend the freedom of Berlin,'' Haddock said.
   Decorated with American, British and French flags, the small
one-story building was given to the German Historical Museum at a
ceremony attended by Allied military chiefs, diplomats and notables
from Berlin.
   The guard post had stood at the Friedrich Street crossing
between West and East Berlin since 1961 when East Germany erected
the Berlin Wall to keep its citizens from moving to the West. Last
November, after a popular revolution, the wall was opened, and in
June the guard building - actually the fourth in a series of
temporary structures - was lifted by a crane and put in storage.
   ``Checkpoint Charlie stood as a symbol of the American support
for a free life,'' said Anke Martiny, a member of the West Berlin
city council responsible for cultural affairs.
   She also recalled the Berlin airlift in which U.S. and British
planes kept Berlin alive in 1948-49, when the Soviet blockade tried
to starve the outpost city in the middle of Communist East Germany.
   ``Without the help of the Allies, Berlin would not have
survived,'' she said.
   Museum Director Christoph Stoelzl said the building would be
stored while a place is found to display it safely. Stoelzl said
the same souvenir-hunters who are hammering constantly on the
remains of the Berlin Wall would probably attack Checkpoint
Charlie, too.
   ``They want to take it away in pieces,'' he said.
   The mundane function of the checkpoint was to serve as a place
to register American, British and French military people traveling
into the Soviet sector. It was usually manned by two American
military police and one French and one British MP, though in 1961,
after the wall went up, U.S. and Soviet tanks faced each other
across the checkpoint in a tense dispute over the right of Allied
soldiers to travel unhindered in the eastern sector.
   ``I've seen it all here,'' said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Nathaniel
Brown, 39, a veteran of three years with the Checkpoint Charlie
unit.
   Brown, of St. Louis, said he had been on duty last Nov. 9 when
the wall was opened ``and a three-day party started.'' Brown said
he also had seen two unsuccessful escape attempts in the summer of
1987.

<HEAD>Serbs Attack Police Station, Seize Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Serbs claiming
harassment by authorities in the republic of Croatia attacked a
police station overnight, seizing arms and ammunition, the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug reported today.
   Hours later, special police units took control of the police
station and began confiscating the weapons, Tanjug said.
   The incident was the latest in a series of increasingly fierce
confrontations between the Croatian authorities and the Serb
minority in the republic.
   Tanjug said an angry crowd of Serbs from Dvor, a Croatian town
about 200 miles west of Belgrade, and from nearby Bosanski Novi,
located in the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, attacked Dvor police
station Friday night.
   The crowd overpowered police - who refrained from using their
firearms during the attack - and occupied the police station,
Tanjug said.
   Members of Croatia's special police units arrived in Dvor
shortly after midnight Friday to help local police, Tanjug said.
   All approaches to the police station and to the town hall were
blocked, with police checking vehicles and their passengers on
access roads, it said.
   Serbs and Croats have been rivals since Yugoslavia was created
in 1918. This traditional rivalry has intensified markelly since
free elections in Croatia resulted in the election of a
center-right government in the republic last spring.
   In Serbia, by contrast, President Slobodan Milosevic has stuck
to rigid communist-style policies. Serbia, the largest of
Yugoslavia's six republics, also wants Yugoslavia to stay a
centralized federation with its capital in the current Serbian and
federal capital of Belgrade.
   Croatia and its northern neighbor Slovenia, where the Communists
also lost power to a center-right coalition in elections last
spring, seek a much looser confederation of republics.
   On Friday, Serbia approved a new constitution emphasizing
centralized control, while the Slovenian parliament adopted
amendments edging that republic closer to full independence.

<HEAD>Ousted Prime Minister Says She'll Appear Before Tribunal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said today she would appear before a tribunal that will decide her
political future.
   Ms. Bhutto has been ordered to stand trial before the special
one-judge court Sunday on charges of misconduct and abuse of power
during her 20 months in office.
   ``I don't recognize the tribunals,'' Ms. Bhutto said after a
speech. ``But I will go there and my lawyer will present my
objections.''
   The 37-year-old former prime minister also was expected to
appear before another tribunal in the eastern city of Lahore on
Tuesday on two similar charges.
   If she is convicted of any of the four charges, she could be
disqualified as a candidate in the Oct. 24 elections and barred
from politics for seven years.
   Ms. Bhutto's husband also has been summoned before the Sindh
High Court on Sunday for allegedly failing to cooperate in police
investigations into high-level corruption.
   Ms. Bhutto won election in November 1988 and became the first
woman to lead a modern Moslem nation.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, using his constitutional power,
dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government on Aug. 6 and installed a
caretaker government comprised largely of her opponents.
   Ishaq Khan accused Ms. Bhutto's government of corruption,
incompetence and abuse of power.
   Ms. Bhutto has denied any wrongdoing and accused the president
and the caretaker government of launching a witch hunt against her,
her government and her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party.
   The charges to be weighed by the Karachi tribunal accuse Ms.
Bhutto of illegally using an Asia Development Bank loan to hire a
foreign consulting firm to oversee a Karachi power project and of
allowing a British-based firm to export cotton at rates far below
the international market rate.
   The caretaker government has tried to portray Ms. Bhutto's
administration as the most corrupt in Pakistan's 43-year history.
   But many Pakistanis believe the way she has been treated has
generated a wave of sympathy for Ms. Bhutto. Analysts say she and
her party appear to be gaining strength and could emerge from next
month's election as the single largest party.

   Vietnam's foreign minister today promised
that his country would withdraw all its military advisers from
Cambodia, but he provided no timetable for the withdrawal.
   The pledge by Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach came before his
meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the
highest-level talks between the two countries since the Vietnam
War.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, has withdrawn all or
most of its 140,000 troops from Cambodia, western intelligence
officials believe. It was not immediately known how many military
advisers remain in Cambodia.
   ``We have withdrawn our forces and we will withdraw all our
advisers,'' the foreign minister said, adding that Vietnam had
agreed to international monitoring in Cambodia.
   The private meeting with Baker followed a series of sessions
this summer between Vietnam's U.N. ambassador and State Department
officials. Vietnam has been seeking to forge diplomatic ties with
the United States.
   Baker said that the two countries would have to resolve such
issues as American prisoners of war and those missing in action
during the Vietnam War.
   ``The minister knows that the pace and the scope of our ability
to move toward normalization with Vietnam is going to depend on
further progress on the POW-MIA issue,'' Baker told reporters.
   President Bush's administration has been expanding diplomatic
contacts with both Hanoi and the Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia. The United States had supported the rebel resistance, but
officials in Washington are now worried that a Communist rebel
faction that once ruled Cambodia will force its way back to power.
   Vietnam installed the Cambodian government when it invaded that
country in 1978 to oust the Communist faction, the Khmer Rouge.
   During its rule from 1975-79, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians directly through purges and executions and
indirectly through starvation and the hardship of a radical
agrarian relocation program.
   Washington has said improved diplomatic ties with Vietnam depend
on Vietnam's cooperation with a U.N. peace plan for Cambodia.
   Under that plan, the United Nations would administer most of
Cambodia's government until new elections are held.
   The plan was worked out by the five permanent U.N. Security
Council members: the United States, Britain, France, China and the
Soviet Union.
   If carried out, it would be an unprecedented U.N. operation to
settle a regional conflict, costing up to $5 billion over one or
two years. It would involve up to 10,000 peacekeeping troops and
10,000 civilian personnel.
   On Friday, President Bush's administration signed agreements
providing $2 million to meet health needs of Cambodian children. It
is the first U.S. government aid earmarked for that country in 15
years.
   The aid will be administered by World Vision Relief and
Development and UNICEF, the U.N. agency to help children.

<HEAD>Senate Race Focuses on Duke's Past as Cross-Burning Ex-Klansman</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Senate Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican David Duke's past as a
cross-burning Ku Klux Klansman is under attack as Democratic Sen.
J. Bennett Johnston tries to deal him a knockout blow in
Louisiana's open primary.
   Johnston, who is seeking a fourth term in Washington, is out to
capture 50 percent of the vote in the Oct  6 primary to avoid a
November runoff against Duke. The senator has gone on the offensive
against Duke after earlier seeking to stress his own experience and
influence in Congress.
   One of Johnston's latest TV spots features old footage of Duke
saluting a burning Klan cross and quotes him as saying, ``There is
no more truly representative symbol of the white race than the
fiery cross.''
   The narrator then warns: ``David Duke is lying about his past.
Don't trust him with our future.''
   Another ad, financed by an independent anti-Duke group, features
a ``Jeopardy''-type game show that asks what politician hired
ex-Nazis to work on his campaign, failed to file state income taxes
for four years and lied about serving in the military. Contestants
correctly answer, ``Who was David Duke?'' in each case.
   The ad closes with the caption: ``Who IS David Duke?''
   Duke, who was elected to the state House in 1989 and remains the
head of the National Association for the Advancement of White
People, insists too much is made of his past.
   He said he plans to go on television this week with a 30-minute
fireside chat explaining his stand on the issues. Duke says he is
opposed to affirmative action plans for minorities and favors
``civil rights for everybody.''
   ``Every elected official is going to find out there is a
majority out there in favor of equal rights, not affirmative
action, and against further tax increases,'' he says.
   The presence of a third major Senate candidate, state Sen. Ben
Bagert of New Orleans, increases the possibility of a runoff
between Johnston and Duke. Although Bagert has the official
blessing of the Republican Party, his campaign has been hampered by
a lack of money and support.
   A recent poll by the University of New Orleans showed Johnston
with 46 percent of the vote, Duke with 21 percent and Bagert with 8
percent. Twenty percent were undecided and 5 percent would not
reveal who they planned to vote for.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, all candidates,
regardless of party, run on the same ballot. If no candidate wins a
majority, the top two finishers meet in a runoff.
   Based on heavy absentee voting, which ended at noon Saturday,
the secretary of state's office predicted that up to 70 percent of
the state's registered voters would cast ballots.
   Johnston said Duke can't win the state, but can damage
Louisiana's reputation if he forces his way into a November runoff.
   Wayne Parent, a political science professor at Louisiana State
University, said a runoff involving Duke could be devastating to
Republicans in other races across the nation.
   ``Republicans have been haunted by the perception that they are
anti-black,'' Parent said. ``Given David Duke's history, his
candidacy is reinforcing the concept of Republicanism and racism.''
   Although the national Republican Party has repudiated Duke,
Parent said, a runoff would give Duke the opportunity to be ``the
Republican Senate candidate for a month.''
   National Republican officials have echoed Parent's view, saying
they do not want Duke to make a runoff. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
campaigned recently with Johnston and said Bagert should drop out
of the race.
   Until early 1989, the Ku Klux Klan's telephone number and that
of Duke were the same. Duke also has been criticized for selling
neo-Nazi literature out of his office and has admitted he wrote a
book showing blacks how to attack ``whitey.''
   Research into Duke's past last week brought to light a 1987
letter in which he advocated separating blood banks by race to
fight the spread of AIDS.
   Duke responded that he now would favor segregating the blood
supply only if AIDS presented a greater threat to one race or
social group. He said he is no longer sure that AIDS is more
prevalent among blacks than whites.
   Duke, a former imperial wizard of the Klan, first attracted
attention in the early 1970s when he showed up at Louisiana State
University's ``Free Speech Alley'' in a Nazi uniform.
   Johnston said that if Duke is elected, Louisiana faces the loss
of federal projects and military installations. Duke has accused
Johnston of using ``scare tactics'' and says he would be effective
in Washington because of a changing national political climate.

   EAST BERLIN (AP) - East Germany's children will grow up in a
nation that is vastly different from the one in which their parents
lived.
   The Associated Press asked German literature teacher Ingeborg
Knirsch to assign an essay to students at Grammar School No. 18 in
East Berlin.
   Forty students were asked to describe how they felt about the
end of East Germany and their future in the new land.
   Here are some representative responses:

   I think it's truly good that German unification is coming. You
could hardly travel freely and give your opinion in other years.
   There is naturally also a negative side, for example
unemployment, losing your home. In any case, I see Germany as my
fatherland, but I think the hatred of foreigners and the drugs are
totally bad. There already is hatred of foreigners in the GDR (East
Germany). But I am totally for a united Germany.
   I have truly given no thought about my own future. But I have no
fear, because I hope to become a catechism teacher, which is
something I could not be before.
   Up until the fifth grade, I thought the GDR was super. But after
I thought about it and talked about it with my parents, I realized
it was a bad government. I found it to be sinister and terrible.
   True, I was content, because we had food and other things, but
that's not my opinion now. I hate the Stasi (secret police) and the
police. The teachers used to ask us for our opinions, but if we
gave our opinions they said that was wrong.
   ... And (former Communist leader Erich) Honecker gave orders to
shoot people who crossed the border. All this was done for the
people.

   I think it's right for a united Germany to be created, but not
so fast and not in this fashion. The coming unity is bringing many
problems for us.
   My mother lost her job and my father is on shorter hours.
Because of that there are a lot of problems in our family. My
mother is afraidbecause the jobless pay is so small and she has to
go to the unemployment office every day to see if there are jobs.
   We had a lot of things that were good, such as social things,
free kindergarten, work holidays, cheap rent and subsidies for
food.
   My future is very uncertain. I hope to learn languages and later
become an interpreter. Perhaps I can also work with computers.
   We should have reformed the older government, but now it is too
late. We brought about a lot with the demonstrations (last year),
but the end of the GDR should not have looked like this. Unity came
too fast.

   There are ... many problems in my family. My parents were both
members of the (Communist Party) and are now in the (reformed
Communist Party.) This party is not particularly beloved, but it
has many supporters.
   I don't believe everything was so bad before the revolution.
Some things were bad, the Stasi for example, but every country has
a secret service.
   My dream is to be a reporter in Boston and to meet the group New
Kids on the Block. But I am afraid that is only a dream.
   I think it was right the wall was built in 1961, but it should
have let more people through. The borders shouldn't have been made
absolutely tight.
   I believe for many people, from a moral standpoint, it was good
that the border was opened on Nov. 9, 1989, because my grandma had
not seen her brother for 28 years.
   The end of the GDR is as if my apartment burned down. It was the
homeland.

   I don't want any unity. Because I always read in the paper and
see on television and hear on the radio that there is so much
joblessness and so much fear.
   The rents rise. How can you pay your rent if you don't have a
job?
   I think it's terrible that the CDU (Christian Democratic Union,
the governing party in both Germanys) is getting rid of all the
foreigners here. They have been here for years and now what?
   I am afraid that I won't find a job. I want to be a zookeeper.
   I find it idiotic that the stores here won't sell East products
anymore. Now that the wall fell I don't really feel secure. Now
there is robbery and murder.
   I also find it idiotic that you have to pay for a doctor visit.
What happens if you are sick and don't have a job?

   The unity of German brings for our fatherland great changes.
Many positive things have come to us, for example, a new range of
goods, but also it raises new questions, for example, unemployment.
   ...The GDR was a highly developed socialist country with many
industries. Certainly I can't write about all of that because I am
still small.
   I am only 12 years old and have still not made a plan for the
future.
   Now the GDR will soon end and we will join together with the FRG
(West Germany). In case of a war, which we would never hope for,
that is a good thing. Because Karl Marx indeed said: ``Unity makes

   Of course, there are things that please me, too. We can buy
pretty things and sweets. But we must not think about our futures,
but the jobs of our parents and about the rent.
   My parents cannot afford to pay 1,000 (marks) per month in our
building, where the elevator doesn't work and there is no warm
water. I don't think it's right that whatever is in the (West
Germany) must be given to us.
   For bread we paid 90 pfennigs, and now we pay three marks.

   The GDR had many good sides and not only bad ones, as everyone
always says. The old government made a lot of mistakes.

<HEAD>Study Shows One-Fifth of Eligible Voters Cast Primary Ballots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer than 20 percent of eligible voters cast
ballots in the 1990 primaries, according to a nonpartisan study
released on Saturday.
   Dismal as it might appear, that turnout was about average for a
midterm election, reported the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate. The report also cautioned that turnout in
primaries is not an indicator of whether voters will be motivated
to go to the polls in November.
   The turnout for states which had primaries in both parties was
19.56 percent, down a fraction of a percent from 1986.
   There were a few bright spots. Hot contests for the Republican
and Democratic nominations for governor of Massachusetts brought
out 32 percent of the voters, the highest turnout for such
elections there since 1962.
   In the District of Columbia, nearly 27 percent of the eligible
Democrats turned out to choose nominees for mayor, the highest
participation since the city gained home rule in 1974.
   In both Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, the surge of
primary election voters resulted in a rejection of political
insiders.
   John Silber won the Democratic nomination for governor of
Massachusetts, easily defeating the pre-election favorite, former
Attorney General Frank Bellotti. Also campaigning as an outsider,
William Weld captured the GOP nomination for governor, defeating
legislative Republican leader Steven Pierce.
   Sharon Pratt Dixon, who has never held elective office, defeated
four officeholders to win the Democratic nomination for mayor of
Washington.
   ``Even in this era of cynicism, public disillusionment with
politics and declining voter participation, the public will vote if
they have something important to vote for or against,'' said Curtis
B. Gans, director of the committee.
   But Gans said it was ``too early to tell whether the
anti-incumbent mood that was reflected in some of the primaries
will turn activist (in November) and whether it will affect all
incumbents or, as is more traditional, the party which occupies the
White House.''
   He also noted primary election turnout has ``not necessarily
been a reliable indicator of general election trends.''
   The states with the highest percentage turnout in the primaries
were Alaska with 37.9 percent; Wyoming 36.3; Arkansas 32.5;
Massachusetts 32.4; Montana 32; Oklahoma 31.3, and Nebraska 30.2.
   Lowest turnout was in Connecticut with 5.2 percent; New Jersey
5.5; South Carolina 7.4; Wisconsin 9.0; Maine 11.3, and Michigan
12.3.

   Ingeborg Knirsch thumbed through the thick
stack of essays and shook her head. So many pages of childhood
scrawl were laced with fear and anxiety.
   These were words written by East German children about the end
of their nation and the birth of a new one. This was the voice of
the next generation.
   ``I was astounded ... astounded,'' said Mrs. Knirsch, a teacher
in East Berlin. ``I'm more optimistic about our future than these
children seem to be.''
   What these essays reflected were households in turmoil, a nation
in transition, a society on the edge of enormous change.
   No one has a greater stake in the fate of the new German nation
than the children of East Germany. The shifting winds of history
have profoundly altered their future.
   They will be the first generation of East Germans to come of age
in a free land, but one that faces tremendous social upheaval as it
leaves the old ways behind.
   The Associated Press visited Grammar School No. 18 and asked
Mrs. Knirsch to assign some of her German literature students an
essay about Wednesday's unification of Germany.
   She chose an eighth-grade class and a sixth-grade class and told
them to write 100-200 words.
   But each class produced torrents of words, an outpouring that
mixed hope for the distant future with a startling bleakness about
the coming months.
   ``I told them `short, short, short,' and they said `No, I must
write,''' Mrs. Knirsch said. ``Five hundred, 600 words, one of them
wrote 800 words. In 45 minutes!''
   She said she was stunned by the content.
   ``They were worried about keeping their homes, about their
parents keeping their jobs, about their rents rising,'' she said.
   Much, she said, was a reflection of the worries expressed by
anxious parents, the grim accounts of furrowed-brow newscasters.
   ``Everything is getting more expensive ... rents, telephone
service and so forth, and many people are jobless,'' wrote Diana
Schulz, 12. ``My parents also are already jobless.''
   ``The rent is higher and my parents lost their jobs,'' wrote
Lohin Lueben, 12. ``The only good thing about Oct. 3 is that it's a
school holiday.''
   There was support for German unity but, paradoxically, regret
the ``GDR'' - German Democratic Republic - would end.
   These children, like all others, were drilled to be loyal to
their nation and Communism, and suspicious of the crime-ridden,
greedy West.
   ``The GDR was my fatherland, and now the GDR really won't be any
more. It is incomprehensible,'' wrote 12-year-old Anke Schramm.
   You can kick a soccer ball from the playground of Grammar School
No. 18 to where the Berlin Wall once loomed. Checkpoint Charlie,
the former Allied border crossing, stood half a block away.
   Much of the neighborhood, part of East Berlin's increasingly
seedy Leipziger Street, has become a lure for derelicts and
criminals.
   On Tuesday, about 200 leftist radicals from West Berlin, wearing
black ski masks and wielding pipes, destroyed the front of a
grocery store nearby.
   Mrs. Knirsch said many children watched the scene from their
apartment buildings.
   Many essays contained worried references to crime.
   ``Now that the Wall fell I don't really feel secure,'' wrote
Julia Axmann, 13.

   The Soviet empire crumbles. Germany unites. Iraq
invades. America intervenes. Japan, though, mainly talks. And
talks.
   Before the Persian Gulf crisis began, serious questions were
raised about whether this Pacific power would soon replace the
United States as the leading global force.
   To some it seemed only a question of time. It will take more
than time, Japan analysts now say. It's not likely to happen at
all, many agree, because in an era when many commentators are
declaring the start of a new world order, the world's No. 2
economic power lacks the vision to be anything more.
   Japan, whose postwar rise was helped by avoiding the military
costs shouldered by the United States and Soviet Union, may see
little reason to grasp a greater political or military role
worldwide.
   ``No other country can replace the United States as the leader
of the world,'' said Seizaburo Sato, a Tokyo University political
scientist and adviser to two former prime ministers.
   ``The world has become uni-polar in a sense. The U.S. is the
only remaining superpower. But the pole is not so high as it once
was, so we would like to support the pole and make it higher.''
   During the gulf crisis, as in many times past, Japan has been
nudged into action by the United States. After 3{ weeks of
government haggling, it promised $1 billion and medical aid to the
multinational gulf force and Arab nations affected by the U.N.
trade embargo on Iraq. Washington criticized the offer as stingy.
   Japan returned with a promise of $3 billion more. But the
belated offer smacked of Japan's old habit of doing the minimum
necessary to appease America.
   ``Japan does not have any idea what to do beyond joining in the
economic sanctions,'' the Asahi Shimbun newspaper editorialized.
   Today, two months after Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, there are
about 200,000 U.S., British and French troops in the Middle East.
   Japan has sent 17 medical personnel. And a debate looms in
Parliament over Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's proposal Thursday -
made on the eve of a U.S. visit - to deploy a small number of
unarmed troops overseas for the first time since World War II.
   Some conservative politicans, fearful of a loss of international
prestige for Japan, are pushing for more: a reinterpretation of the
ban in Japan's postwar constitution on using force overseas.
   They are quietly backed by commanders of the Self-Defense
Forces, Japan's military. But the commanders have little say in a
country still bitter over an independent military that broke free
of civilian control in the 1930s, leading to war.
   Japan's political timidity predates the gulf crisis. Wielding
economic might beyond her militarist dreams a half-century ago,
Japan still dragged its feet in offering aid to newly liberalized
Eastern Europe. Officials contended the region was too remote.
   Tokyo recently became the world's No. 1 source of foreign aid,
but only after years of pressure from the United States and other
Western nations tired of watching Japan recycle profits back into
its blockbuster economy.
   Most of the aid has been issued in loans, not the typical
grants, and the program has been criticized as commercially
self-serving and inefficient.
   ``Japan still doesn't have a concept of itself as a global
actor,'' said Sheila Smith, a researcher at the Japan Institute of
International Affairs in Tokyo. ``(Japanese believe) the world is
not their problem.''
   U.S. public opinion polls show Americans overwhelmingly back
President Bush's policy of intervening in the gulf. Surveys here,
however, indicate most Japanese feel America is only defending its
oil interests, even though Japan imports more of its oil - 70
percent - from the Middle East than any other industrialized
nation.
   In one recent poll, 83 percent of Japanese said they opposed
sending military personnel to the gulf.
   Japan's leaders are not being naive. As historian Paul Kennedy
argued in his bestselling book ``The Rise And Fall of The Great
Powers,'' major nations have declined by overexpanding, straining
their economies with military expenditures.
   Japan has avoided such a role.
   ``Japan has been able to enjoy all the advantages of evolving
into a global economic giant, but without any of the political
responsibilities and territorial disadvantages which have,
historically, followed from such a growth,'' Kennedy wrote.
   ``Little wonder that it prefers things to remain as they are.''
   Japanese analysts argue that empire-building nations usually
focused on pragmatic, self-centered policies. Only the United
States, they say, has made its ostensible goal the exportation of
democracy and freedom as universal principles.
   Japan recently made independent diplomatic forays into North
Korea and China as part of its strategy of creating a regional
power base.
   Japan's foreign policy has been summed up as: Do whatever is
needed to maintain Japan's ``special relationship'' with the United
States - a code phrase signifying the U.S.-Japan security
arrangement and Japan's huge export stake in the U.S. economy.
   ``It's been a very successful foreign policy for 40 years,''
said Gerald Curtis, a Japanese politics expert at Columbia
University in New York. ``But it's no longer sufficient.''

   The Houston Ship Channel reopened today after
emergency crews determined that only a small amount of cleaning
solvent escaped from a barge punctured by a Norwegian tanker in
Galveston Bay.
   ``It looks like it evaporated off,'' said Lynn Garner, president
of Garner Environmental Co. of Houston. ``There's no pollution.''
   No injuries were reported in the latest accident in the Houston
Ship Channel, where 700,000 gallons of oil was spilled from a Greek
tanker in July.
   The 538-foot tanker on Friday evening struck one of two barges
pulled by a tugboat about three miles offshore from Texas City, the
Coast Guard said.
   ``The tug was able to push the barges out of the channel and up
onto the bank,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. Frank Whipple said. ``They are
resting on the bank.''
   At least one of the 297-foot barge's eight tanks, each with a
capacity of 134,400 gallons, leaked a substance known as reformate,
said Michael Lee, a Coast Guard spokesman in Galveston. Reformate
is a volatile, colorless petroleum distillate used as a
manufacturing solvent, as a dry-cleaning fluid and in blending
gasolines.
   Garner said he did not know how much solvent spilled, but ``it's
a small amount.''
   In June, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg was rocked by an
explosion about 58 miles offshore from Galveston, spilling more
than 3.9 million gallons of oil.
   In July, about 700,000 gallons of oil spilled into the
environmentally sensitive bay when the Greek tanker Shinoussa and
two barges collided.
   About 860 million barrels of oil are shipped into Texas ports
each year, according to the state General Land Office, which is in
charge of cleaning up oil spills.

<TEXT>
   The first units of the famed French
Foreign Legion arrived Saturday in Saudi Arabia, joining the
largest deployment of French forces overseas since Algeria's war of
independence.
   About 150 men marched silently off the ferry Le Corse, which
docked in this Red Sea port at noon after an eight-day trip from
Toulon. Docking was delayed more than two hours by thick morning
fog.
   Two cargo ships, the Atlas and the Cap Ferat, docked Saturday
with some of the French force's 250 trucks. Five more ships
carrying troops and equipment are expected the next two days.
   The legionnaires are part of France's 4,000-man Rapid Action
Force. Most of that contingent is due to arrive Sunday at the vast,
new industrial complex in Yanbu.
   When the deployment is complete, there will be 2,300
legionnaires in their distinctive dark green berets in Saudi Arabia
among the growing U.S.-led multinational force confronting Iraq.
   France, which has 14 warships in the region and is sending three
squadrons of combat jets, will have a force of about 13,000 men in
the gulf region when the deployment is completed.
   French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has said the
French force will be autonomous and not under U.S. command.
   ``Heat is our first enemy,'' said Capt. Renard, the officer in
charge of the first company of the 2nd Foreign Legion infantry
regiment based in Nimes, France. He would not give his first name.
   Aside from the legionnaires, the ferry carried about 750 other
troops - 150 from the 21st Regiment of Marine Infantry from Frejus
and about 500 from logistics and medical units.
   Its hold was full of trucks carting everything from kitchens to
generators and ammunition.
   The ground forces will to head overland for northeastern Saudi
Arabia, a three-day trip.
   They will take up positions among the other foreign troops in
the Legion's largest overseas deployment since Algeria's 1954-62
independence war.
   The position will be about 60 miles from the nearest Iraqi
troops across the border in occupied Kuwait. About 150 troops of
the Rapid Action Force who arrived Monday are already in place.
   Gen. Michel Roquejeoffre, the overall French commander and a
paratrooper, greeted Col. Gilbert LeGuen, commander of the
logistics unit.
   Most of the legionnaires maintained a stony silence, following
orders, as they marched single-file along the quay.
   Their first stay will be in a warehouse larger than a football
field to regroup for the trip across the desert.
   Their commanding officer said it has been a half-century since
the Legion gave refuge to any person off the street.
   ``We take who we like, not just anybody. The days of anybody are
over,'' said Renard, a 10-year veteran of the force.
   But the Legion is still made up of 90 nationalities and
occasionally British-clipped English could be heard from the ranks.
   The legionnaires themselves would not say where they were
originally from, although about half are French.
   ``Once you join the legion, you're just a legionnaire,'' said an
officer who ordered all his men to speak French while reporters
were around.
   Renard, 47, said most of the men under his command had returned
from more than four months in the Sahara desert in Chad last
February, and he expected conditions in Saudi Arabia to be the
same.
   ``I think it may be a little hotter here. We'll find out,'' the
captain said.
   Renard said the legionnaires had not been briefed on how long
they would stay in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The legionnaires do what is asked of them. A legionnaire is a
soldier first,'' he said.

   After 45 years, the Soviet Union finally got
invited to the premier celebration of capitalism, the annual
meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   But the Soviet delegates spent the week sitting in a corner, far
away from the action, playing the role of economic wallflowers.
They came to the ball but were not asked to dance.
   Instead, they sat on the sidelines right next to Mongolia.
   The only difference is that Mongolia has formally applied for
membership in the IMF and the World Bank and its application is
expected to receive speedy approval.
   The Soviet Union, uncertain of its chances for success, has yet
to apply for membership. The Soviet delegation, however, left no
doubt that the country would like to join the institutions Soviet
leaders used to deride as bastions of capitalist economics.
   The IMF and World Bank, with their huge lending resources, look
a lot more inviting these days with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev appealing for massive amounts of Western aid for his
faltering economy.
   Victor V. Geraschenko, the head of the Soviet delegation and the
chairman of the country's state bank, the Gosbank, met wit various
finance ministers and with top IMF and World Bank officials to
present his country's case.
   He declined to be specific about when the Soviets might submit a
formal membership application although he said one could come next
year.
   But even with the desperate situation facing the Soviet economy,
IMF and World Bank officials said they did not see any prospect for
quick membership for the country.
   ``The Soviets are obviously interested in integrating their
economy into the global economy. But it will take some time for
them to go through the process of membership application,'' World
Bank President Barber Conable said at the close of last week's
meetings.
   ``We do not anticipate an early membership by the Soviet
Union,'' Conable said.
   Officials give a variety of reasons for hesistance in accepting
the Soviets as members in the two institutions. These range from
the difficulty in interpreting Soviet economic statistics to the
lack of convertibility for the Soviet currency, the ruble.
   However, the major stumbling block is political. The United
States, the country with the largest voting power in both
institutions, is at present opposed to Soviet membership.
   The fear in the Bush administration is that given the turmoil
wracking the Soviet economy, massive amounts of Western aid
supplied now could well end up being wasted or perhaps even
delaying needed movement toward a free-market economy.
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford said the United States is
awaiting the results of a study of the Soviet economy before
deciding whether to modify its current opposition to direct Western
aid.
   That review, which is being coordinated by the IMF, is scheduled
to be completed in December. Top finance officials from the world's
seven richest industrial countries - the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy - received a closed-door
briefing on the study last week.
   One official, who spoke on condition that he not be named, said
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus stressed that the Soviet
Union needed a strong central bank as a key step in getting control
of its serious economic problems.
   The debate over how much power to give the central government is
currently being hotly debated in the Soviet Union with many leaders
in the 15 Soviet republics seeking ways to give the central
government less, not more, power.
   In the absence of IMF and World Bank membership, the two
agencies did make an offer to provide the Soviets with technical
assistance, an approach that also is favored by the United States.
   ``The Soviets are interested in doing a lot of restructuring and
doing it fairly quickly. We are happy to advise them about that
because that is our business,'' said Conable, whose agency last
year made $20 billion of development loans to Third World
countries.
   Camdessus said there was a precedent for the IMF providing
technical advice to non-members. He said the agency was
instrumental in helping Namibia set up a central bank before it
became a member this year and he said the same help would be
available to the Soviets.
   With the speed of current events, Camdessus said it would be
wrong to assume that just because the Soviets did not now qualify
for IMF-World Bank membership, that situation would never change.
   ``At last year's meeting, who could have imagined that we would
be on the verge of seeing a unified Germany,'' Camdessus said.
``History is moving very rapidly. To tell you where we will be in a
year or two is very difficult.''

   Iran's resumption of diplomatic relations
with Britain caps two months of nonstop political, military and
economic gains for Tehran since its old foe, Iraq, invaded Kuwait.
   For the past few weeks, everything seems to have been going
Iran's way amid the chaos touched off by the Iraqi invasion. In
many ways, Iran has won more since Kuwait was overrun Aug. 2 by
Iraqi forces than it did in the decade of upheaval and war that
followed the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   The gulf crisis is far from being resolved. But Tehran, courted
by both sides, is already looking like one of the winners from the
confrontation between two of its old enemies, Iraq and the United
States.
   The irony is that Tehran owes much of what it has gained to
Saddam Hussein, whose country it fought from 1980 to 1988 in a war
that had no victor, only victims, and caused at least 1 million
casualties.
   Saddam's invasion gave Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani a
golden opportunity to accelerate his efforts to end the Islamic
republic's isolation, improve relations with the West and secure
investment and advanced technology to rebuild the economy.
   Last week, Iran boasted it has taken delivery of advanced MiG-29
interceptors for its badly depleted air force under a $6 billion
economic and military agreement with Moscow.
   Restoring relations with London will likely speed up
Rafsanjani's efforts to normalize links with western Europe and
could herald the release of British hostages held in Lebanon.
   Four Britons are among the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
Most are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants.
   The Tehran Times, which often reflects Rafsanjani's thinking,
noted Saturday: ``The complete normalization of Iranian relations
with the European Community can lead to extensive cooperation in
many areas, particularly the Persian Gulf crisis.''
   Tehran severed relations with Britain on March 7, 1989, over
Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which Iran's late
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, deemed had
blasphemed Islam. He issued a fatwa, or religious ruling,
condemning Rushdie to death.
   Britain rejected Iranian demands to ban the book and denounce
Rushdie. Iran refused to lift the death sentence, even after
Khomeini died in June 1989.
   The 12 EC nations withdrew their ambassadors from Tehran in
solidarity with Britain after Khomeini's death decree. Most later
sent envoys back, but have withheld full normalization until
relations with Britain were restored.
   Thursday's announcement that relations are being restored did
not spell out the agreement beyond saying it was based on ``mutual
respect.''
   But British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd stressed that Iranian
leaders had indicated there would be no interference in the
``internal affairs of any other country.''
   That was interpreted to mean Iran would quietly drop the death
sentence on Rushdie, without publicly revoking it.
   There have even been slight movements in Iran's stormy
relationship with the United States. On Sept. 21, the United States
paid a $200 million claim to Iran for undelivered American
equipment orders dating from before the 1979 Islamic revolution. It
was the largest claim before a tribunal settling billions in
Iranian assets frozen by the United States.
   In the last few days, Iran has also restored relations with
Tunisia, severed in 1987 amid allegations Tehran was backing Moslem
fundamentalists seeking to topple the government. There are signs,
too, of a thaw in the feud with Saudi Arabia.
   Some analysts and diplomats are talking about including Iran in
a new regional defense alliance with Egypt, Turkey, Syria and Saudi
Arabia.
   Whether that ever emerges, Arab strategists even talking about
including Iran underlines now how Rafsanjani has led his country
toward international acceptance after years as a pariah and how the
gulf crisis has redrawn the political map of the Middle East.
   ``The Islamic Republic has emerged more powerful than ever. It
has won everything for which it fought,'' an Asian diplomat in
Tehran said in a telephone interview.
   Saddam, finding himself in a tight corner after the invasion,
abruptly gave into Iranian demands Aug. 15 after two years of
deadlocked peace negotiations on formally ending the war.
   He withdrew his army from Iranian territory seized in the
conflict, began a prisoner-of-war exchange and agreed to share
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the strategically
important southern border between Iran and Iraq.
   Baghdad's improved relations with Tehran have allowed Iraq to
shift forces toward Kuwait. Iraq also has tried to persuade Iran to
break a U.N. Security Council embargo, but Iran has pledged to
abide by the sanctions.
   For the Iranians, Saddam's cave-in meant they had won the gulf
war, in a moral sense if not militarily.
   They felt it vindicated their claim that Iraq was the aggressor
and their warnings that Saddam would one day turn on his erstwhile
allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   Iran's leaders are now waiting for a possible visit to Tehran by
Saddam himself - an event that for them would be the final act of
Iraqi submission.

   The gathering of nations to the brink of war in
the Middle East is a sign some evangelical leaders believe may
herald the most feared and sought-after age in Christianity -
Armageddon and the Second Coming.
   At least one fundamentalist television evangelist believes God
may call all born-again Christians up to heaven at any day. That
would usher in a seven-year period of destruction that only a third
of the world's population would survive before Christ comes to rule
over a world in which the lion will lay down with the lamb and
swords will be beaten into plowshares.
   ``Saddam Hussein is just kind of an activator bringing it all
together,'' said the Rev. Charles Taylor, host of the syndicated
television show ``Today in Bible Prophecy.'' ``It's time to rejoice
for the Christians. We're going home.''
   What has caused the current revival in speculation of the end
time is the resurgence of Babylon in the form of modern-day Iraq.
The ruins of the ancient city lie 60 miles south of present-day
Baghdad.
   Several of the Bible's prophetic books, including Isaiah,
Revelation and Ezekiel, refer to the rise and fall of Babylon. Some
believe Babylon's rise today may be the precursor of the final
battle between the Lord and the enemies of Israel, and the coming
of the savior to rule over the world.
   Few evangelicals are ready to don white robes and implore people
on street corners to ``Repent, the end is near!'' But some are
saying Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and menacing stance toward Israel
point toward the the final conflict between good and evil.
   ``I would not predict we are near the end of the age, although I
personally think we are,'' evangelist Billy Graham said.
   Religious movements built around predictions of Christ's Second
Coming have long been a part of U.S. religious history.
   In the 19th century, the Rev. William Miller caused thousands of
Americans to prepare for the Lord's Coming. Even after his
predicted dates in the 1840s passed by uneventfully, his work laid
the foundation for the Seventh-Day Adventist movement. Later in the
century, Jehovah's Witnesses grew into a national movement amid
similar predictions.
   More recently, some thought former President Reagan's foreign
policy, particularly his hawkish view of Soviet Union, may have
been based on a belief in biblical warnings of Armageddon being
started by invaders from the north.
   Saddam has done little to discourage speculation he may trigger
the final conflict. Seeking to exploit his nation's past glories,
the Iraqi leader has spent millions to rebuild Babylon. He also has
portrayed himself as the new Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian
warrior-king who sacked Jerusalem in the 6th century B.C.
   In seeking greater Arab support for his invasion of Kuwait,
Saddam also has spoken in increasingly ominous terms about Israel.
   ``History has gone full circle and we are coming back to these
lands,'' Graham said during a recent crusade. ``This is not another
Korea, it is not another Vietnam - it is something far more
sinister and far more difficult.''
   ``The circumstances are such that we see the culmination of
God's plan for planet Earth,'' said the Rev. Paul Schenck of New
Covenant Tabernacle, a large Assemblies of God church in suburban
Buffalo, N.Y.
   He added that he has mixed feelings about the possibility - ``I
will not be disappointed if my children grow up and I see my
great-grandchildren.''
   Most mainline biblical scholars give little credence to such
speculation. They say such analysis takes out of context biblical
passages that were written in a specific culture and time for
different teaching purposes.
   Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee puts it
bluntly: ``I would not give Saddam Hussein any place in a
theological end time.''
   Such criticism does not bother a fundamentalist such as Taylor,
who interprets the Bible literally and believes the bodily ascent
of Christians into heaven before Armageddon can happen at any time.
   ``Wars usually happen in the Middle East in the October period -
before the snows come and after the hot weather,'' Taylor said.
``The Lord would really have to put it on hold the way things are
going.''
   thers are less certain that the decisive battle between the
forces of good and evil is at hand.
   ``Even some of the most intense prophecy preachers are reluctant
to say, `This is it','' said the Rev. Richard Buhler, host of a
national radio show for evangelicals called ``Table Talk.''
   Some factors work against the theories linking Saddam and
Armageddon.
   For one thing, skeptics can cite references to Babylon's being a
great power holding the riches of the world at the time of its
destruction. The Rev. Chuck Smith, a radio evangelist based in
Costa Mesa, Calif., says the Iraqis could fit that description
within two years if they gain control of enough oil.
   ``God is focusing the attention of the world on the Middle East
to alert us to the fact time is running out,'' said Smith, whose
program, ``The Word for Today,'' is heard on 150 radio stations.
   Meantime, what does one do?
   Taylor is urging his listeners to make a final effort to convert
friends and relatives to born-again Christianity, while others say
Christians should look beyond the initial period of suffering to
promises of another paradise beyond Armageddon.
   ``Rather than forebodings of doom, these things to us are just
the prelude to a glorious new day,'' said Smith. ``Personally, I
believe the Lord will ... create heaven on Earth.''

   Three years ago, George Bush complained that the
United Nations was ``another light that failed,'' largely
ineffective and sometimes counterproductive. On Monday, he will
stand before the General Assembly and praise the U.N.'s resolve in
opposing Iraq's aggression.
   There has been a remarkable turnabout in the White House
attitude toward the U.N., which not so long ago was viewed as a
platform for anti-Americanism and Third World dissent.
   Now, administration leaders do not hide their delight over the
tough stands taken by the U.N. against Iraq, spanning eight
Security Council resolutions condemning its invasion of Kuwait and
imposing bans on trade and financial dealings.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said John Bolton, assistant secretary of
State for international relations. ``It's like being in San
Francisco in 1945'' when the U.N. was founded amid an air of
idealism.
   ``We are reading articles of the U.N. charter that have not been
seriously read in 45 years,' Bolton said. ``A lot of what we're
doing, we're doing quite literally for the first time in the
history of the United Nations.''
   Says Bush: ``We're now in sight of a United Nations that
performs as envisioned by its founders. ... The United Nations is
backing up its words with action.''
   The dramatic change is due in large measure to the warming of
relations between the United States and Soviet Union. The
superpowers, throughout the Cold War, had used the U.N. as a
primary forum for ideological battles. Now, they stand more as
allies than adversaries.
   ``When the U.S. and the Soviets decide the U.N. will be a
serious place, it's a serious place,'' said Judith Kipper, a Middle
East expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
   There are other explanations, as well, for the U.N.'s unity in
the Persian Gulf crisis. There are Third World nations worried by
the specter of a larger nation gobbling up a helpless neighbor;
there are countries concerned about oil prices and supplies; there
are countries jockeying for position in the Arab world.
   ``Everyone is acting according to their self-interests,'' said
Alan Keyes, former assistant secretary of State for international
relations. ``It didn't require much persuasion'' to achieve a U.N.
consensus.
   Charles Lichenstein, who was alternate U.S. representative at
the U.N. in the early 1980s, said the Security Council resolutions
were a useful way of rallying nations that traditionally feel
obliged to be anti-American.
   ``It provides a number of countries with a marvelous excuse for
being on the side of the United States when they might not have
leapt to their feet otherwise,'' he said.
   Bolton said that when Iraq invaded Kuwait, ``it was kind of an
automatic decision'' to turn to the U.N. For one thing, Bush had
been U.S. ambassador to the world body from 1971 to 1973 and had a
feel for the organization.
   Perhaps more importantly, there was a belief that the U.N., over
the past three to four years, had started to act effectively in
matters of international peace and security, such as the Iran-Iraq
war, the transition of Namibia to independent status and U.N.
oversight of Nicaraguan elections.
   Bush signaled a new attitude toward the U.N. when he picked a
highly respected career diplomat, Thomas Pickering, as U.N.
ambassador. A skilled trouble shooter, Pickering had served as
ambassador both in Israel and in Jordan.
   ``The fact that he selected Pickering shows very strongly that
he (Bush) has a commitment to the institution,'' said James
Spiegelman, director of research for Georgetown University's Center
for International Business and Trade. ``You can't underestimate the
importance of having a guy like Pickering in there as Bush's top
man, maneuvering votes and doing his bidding.''
   Administration officials say Bush has taken an active role with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in advising Pickering.
   ``He knows the strengths and weaknesses of the U.N. better than
the head of government anywhere in the world,'' said Bolton. ``He
just has a very good sense of the institution.''
   With a penchant for personal diplomacy, Bush also has used the
telephone frequently to sustain the consensus against Iraq. Between
Aug. 2 and Sept. 7, Bush talked with foreign leaders on 71
occasions about the gulf, officials said.
   Yet, some question whether Bush's U.N. experience has been
instrumental in dealing with the world body.
   ``The fact is, it takes you about five minutes to learn what
string to pull,'' said Lichenstein. ``He was there for
substantially less than two years. You don't learn very much in two
years.''
   Keyes said that with reduced Soviet tensions and Arab
nervousness about Iraq, ``It's not very hard for us to put together
the coalition'' at the U.N.

<HEAD>Cape Verde Parliament Approves Proposal for Multiparty System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament of Cape Verde has
approved a proposal to revise the West African island nation's
constitution to permit a multiparty system and free elections,
according to news reports Saturday.
   The ruling African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde
(PAIVV) has announced plans to hold legislative elections in
January and presidential elections the following month.
   Under the current 1980 constitution, the PAICV is the only party
permitted in the nation of 360,000 inhabitants, which gained
independence from Portugal in 1975. The PAICV has governed since
independence.
   Portuguese newspapers reported Saturday that the government and
the leading opposition Movement for Democracy (MPD) had reached
agreement on major political reforms after four days of talks.
   The government agreed to replace top people in state-run media
to avoid manipulation of the news preceding the elections.
   But MPD leaders criticized the government for refusing to
recognize the existence of a political police force and promise to
disband it.
   The Popular Assembly, or parliament, also voted Friday to remove
from the constitution a reference to the PAICV as the driving force
in the state and society.
   The assembly is expected too to consider proposals to grant the
president powers to veto government decisions and dismiss the
Cabinet.
   Cape Verde President Aristides Pereira has vowed to steer the
10-island archipelago 385 miles west of Senegal into a free-market
economy.

   The hills know nothing of Saddam Hussein;
they hear no talk of recession. The vibrant reds, oranges and
yellows emblazon the countryside in a burst of glory before the
long, white silence that lies ahead.
   Only the people worry, especially those who make money from the
annual pilgrimage of millions of ``leaf-peepers'' who come north to
view nature's autumn splendor. New England's sagging economy has
many in the tourism business eager for a hearty foliage season.
   ``This is a critical season for the travel industry,'' said
Christopher Barbieri, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.
``After a soft summer in the region, we're counting on this as a
last blast before ski season.''
   But with wild cards such as the Persian Gulf crisis and
increased competition from other states, the New England fall
season may be weaker than in the past.
   ``This Middle East crisis could not have come at a worse time,''
Barbieri said. ``We're watching to see how it affects the economic
situation, which will in turn affect us. It's a danger signal.''
   A slow summer in the northern New England states - Vermont, New
Hampshire and Maine - has them looking to the mid-September to
mid-October fall foliage season to bolster the travel and retail
industries.
   ``June and July were off by 5 and 15 percent,'' said Dick
Hamilton, president of New Hampshire's White Mountain Attractions
Association. ``If we can do well and go into a long, cold winter
with a good fall season, people will be happy.''
   In Maine, where tourism is the state's second largest industry
behind paper production, a weak season hurts the whole economy,
said John A. Johnson of the Maine Tourism Office.
   ``Tourism is all we've got. In Massachusetts, people who aren't
hired as waiters or chambermaids can get jobs in light industry. We
don't have that here,'' he said. ``Oh, do we need a good year.''
   The fall season has long been considered the gravy of the
tourism year, because little or no promotion was needed to get the
people here.
   But competition from other states that are heavily promoting the
colors of their leaves - even Arkansas is jumping for the
leaf-peepers with a sophisticated advertising campaign - is hurting
the New England states, Barbieri said.
   ``We've always taken it for granted, but those days of assuming
we have a corner on the leaf market are over,'' he said. ``Other
places have discovered that they have pretty leaves too.''
   New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont officials each estimate about a
million people flock to their states in the brief but brilliant
season.
   But some of those people travel by car and may be inclined to
stay at home this year because of rising gas prices.
   ``If there is a fuel shortage scare, then we will see a drop in
business,'' Barbieri said. ``And if gas prices rise above the
psychological threshold of $2 a gallon, people may think twice.''
   One indicator of a slow fall is the hotel and bus tour
reservations. Some motor coach operators say the market to New
England is softer than it has been in the past.
   ``Reservations are not where they were four or five years ago,''
said Peter Tauk, owner and general manager for Tauk Tours of
Westport, Conn. ``New England this fall is soft for every tour
operator.''
   The states are not forecasting a poor year, just a year that
could leave some general store tills a little less full.
   Barbieri said he expects the million tourists who will visit
Vermont - twice the state's population - to spend more than $16
million.
   And the tourists in the fall are likely to be a bit freer with
their money. Foliage draws the singles, couples and senior
citizens, who may have a greater disposable income, Barbieri said.
   ``These folks are less likely to ride the Alpine Slide, but more
likely to buy some things for Christmas,'' he said.

   After combatively defending himself at a public
hearing against federal conflict-of-interest charges, Neil Bush now
faces a potentially more damaging hurdle that could hit his wallet
as well as his reputation.
   In addition to the government's conflict-of-interest case, the
president's son faces a new $200 million lawsuit against him and
other former directors of a failed Colorado savings and loan. The
suit alleges that ``gross negligence'' by the directors contributed
to the thrift's collapse.
   That intensifies the pressure on Neil Bush, 35, who already has
become an unwilling symbol of the savings and loan crisis and a
potential political liability for his father and the Republican
Party.
   The negligence suit, filed Sept. 21 by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., ``obviously made it more difficult'' for Neil
Bush, his attorney, James Nesland, said in an interview Friday.
   Bush testified for three hours Thursday before an administrative
law judge, insisting that his business dealings with two Denver
developers did not conflict with his role as a director of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association. The developers,
Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, eventually defaulted on more than
$132 million in loans from Silverado.
   Silverado collapsed in late 1988, leaving U.S. taxpayers with a
$1 billion tab for reimbursing depositors of the federally insured
institution. Bush was a director of Silverado from August 1985 to
August 1988, quitting the post a few days after his father won the
Republican presidential nomination.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking an
administrative order against Bush that could lead to barring him
from the banking and savings industry. The regulators contend that
Bush failed to adequately inform fellow Silverado directors of his
business ties with Good and Walters, who invested in Bush's oil
company, JNB Exploration.
   Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson will examine
testimony from last week's hearing before him and is expected to
recommend in January to OTS Director Timothy Ryan what sanctions,
if any, should be taken against Bush. Ryan is scheduled to make a
decision in May, and Bush would have the right to appeal it to a
federal court.
   Just four days before the start of the OTS hearing in a federal
courtroom in Denver, the FDIC filed its lawsuit.
   ``That can't be coincidental,'' Nesland said in an interview in
his high-rise office. ``One has to recognize that those (federal)
agencies act jointly.''
   The timing of the lawsuit, he contended, was ``symptomatic of
the concerted effort by the banking agencies'' to prejudice his
client's case.
   The regulators insisted, however, that the suit was filed that
day because the FDIC had just finished its review of the matter
after about six months of consideration.
   ``Politics simply are not involved,'' said Alan Whitney, an FDIC
spokesman in Washington.
   Politics or no, the civil lawsuit brings a new dimension to the
Bush case by threatening him with financial liability, not just
banishment from the banking and savings industry.
   The liability insurance for Silverado officers and directors
lapsed in 1986, and it is unclear whether the defendants would be
able to tap a special fund which the thrift had set aside for legal
fees.
   Bush's financial situation also is uncertain. He borrowed
$125,000 for his new oil exploration venture, Bush Energy Co., over
the past 16 months from a Denver cable television executive, Fred
Vierra, according to public records.
   ``As far as Fred was concerned, the loan was personal,'' John
Neal, a spokesman for Vierra, said Friday.
   ``Fred didn't ask them what they were going to do with the
money,'' Neal added, referring to Bush and his wife, Sharon.
   He said the loans, with an interest rate of around 10 percent,
were secured by a second lien on the Bush's $550,000 house in an
upscale area of Denver. The first lien, for $440,000, is held by
Bank Western.
   Bush has declined comment on the matter.
   Neal said Vierra, the president of United Artists Entertainment
Co. of Denver, has known Neil and Sharon Bush for about seven
years.

<HEAD>One of World's Last Great Gothic Churches Completed After 83 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the world's last great Gothic churches
was formally completed today, with President Bush and thousands of
others gathering to see the final stone laid for what Bush called
the ``symbol of our Nation's spiritual life.''
   Bush said the completion of the Washington National Cathedral
recalled to him the words spoken by the late Rev. Martin Luther Kig
from its pulpit just days before the civil rights leader was
assassinated.
   ``He said `We will bring about a new day of justice and
brotherhood and peace. And on that day, morning stars will sing
together, and the sons of God will shout for joy,''' Bush said.
   He said the cathedral, in use during most of its construction
years, has been a place where the nation has come to understand, to
grieve, to celebrate and to express concern.
   ``And so we have constructed here this symbol of our nation's
spiritual life, overlooking the center of our nation's secular
life,'' the presdient said at the stone-laying ceremony.
   He said the cathedral ``carries with it a constant reminder of
our moral obligations.''
   It was a long time coming. It was just 83 years ago to the day
that President Theodore Roosevelt rode to Mount St. Albans, the
highest point in the capital, to see the foundation stone laid. A
crowd of 10,000 braved threatening weather to join him.
   Cathedral spokeswoman Jean Grigsby said at least that many were
expected today. Sunny and warm weather was forecast. On Sept. 29,
1907, it had been raining and the sun burst through the clouds just
moments before the ceremony began.
   The stone reserved to the last is a 1,000-pound piece of Indiana
limestone carved in the shape of a folded leaf or flower. It has
been on display inside, but was moved onto the grounds of the
cathedral and lifted into place by a crane.
   The stone rests on the southwest pinnacle of the cathedral's St.
Paul Tower.
   The 873,021-square foot building, roughly 14th century English
Gothic in style, is the sixth largest cathedral in the world.
   St. Peter's in Rome is the largest, followed by one in Seville,
Spain; the unfinished St. John the Divine in New York and
cathedrals in Liverpool, England, and Milan, Italy.
   Richard T. Feller, the canon clerk of the works at the
cathedral, said in a recent interview that he believes it will be
the last built in the Gothic style.
   ``There isn't the craftsmanship available,'' he said. ``There
isn't the design ability.''
   The 150,000-ton church was built in the traditional
stone-on-stone method of the medieval cathedral builders, although
with modern equipment. The bearing walls have no steel
reinforcement, but are supported by stone buttresses.
   Construction began at the east end with the laying of the
foundation stone beneath what is now the Bethlehem Chapel. The twin
towers at the west end, a tenth of a mile away, are named for St.
Peter and St. Paul.
   The cathedral is the headquarters of the Episcopal Diocese of
Washington but calls itself a ``house of prayer for all people.''
   Funeral services for President Eisenhower were held in the
cathedral. President Woodrow Wilson is buried there. As Bush
recalled, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached from its pulpit.
So has the Rev. Desmond Tutu.
   Work on the cathedral was halted during World War I and World
War II and stopped again in 1977 because of a shortage of funds. It
was resumed in 1980.
   Today's ceremony will be followed by a service of consecration
Sunday.

<HEAD>Student Leader Says D.C. University Protest Likely to Continue Into
Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiations between students and members of
the board of trustees of the University of the District of Columbia
began again today but student leaders say the impasse over student
protests won't end in time for classes to resume on Monday.
   ``Honestly, right now we don't anticipate an end by Monday,''
said student spokesman Mark Thomspson.
   Thompson said the board was undermining the talks through
actions taken against the students.
   ``While negotiations are contiuning, all students here are in
imminent danger,'' he said.
   ``We have been threatened by the board of trustees and by the
mayor that police could move in at any given moment.''
   University spokesman John Britton denied the allegations,
calling them ``hogwash.''
   He said the trustees have issued no threats.
   Thompson also said that the heat had been turned on the
buildings they occupy during the day when temperatures are warm.
Conversely, Thompson said, the air conditioning was activated in
the late night and early morning hours as it became cooler.
   The cars of students participating in the protest also were
being impounded, Thompson said.
   UDC officials said Friday they would resume classes next week
despite a student protest that has kept the school closed since
Wednesday.
   ``We are prepared to move this institution forward,'' the Rev.
A. Knighton Stanley, a member of the school's board of trustees,
said Friday night. ``This board of trustees is prepared to open
this institution on Monday morning.''
   Stanley declined to say how the 12,000-student public
institution will be reopened if the dozens of students occupying
university offices refuse to leave, but he said negotiations would
go on over the weekend.
   Former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson showed up on the
campus Friday night and said he was prepared to place himself
between the students and police if a confrontation developed. But
he said, ``I am convinced that rational and caring minds can arrive
at a just and non-violent conclusion.''
   The protesters seized control of two university buildings
Wednesday and asked fellow students to boycott classes, accusing
the board of taking actions that threatened the school's quality of
education.
   They asked for the resignation of the 11 mayoral appointees to
the 15-member board of trustees.
   The students had cut off negotiations Friday after board members
refused to quit immediately, Stanley said.
   ``The only thing they were willing to hear was the resignation
of this board,'' he said. ``When I indicated to them that it would
put them in a position of negotiating with nobody or with lame
ducks or with non-entities, they would not move in that regard and
legal counsel did not move them to move beyond (that).''
   The UDC Faculty Senate has backed the students, who also want
improved academic and athletic programs, compliance with education
standards set by a regional accreditation board and an increased
emphasis on African-American studies.
   Sam Carcione, president of the faculty union, said he also
wanted trustees to resign. ``The board has been our enemy for a
long time,'' he said. Three City Council members also called for
the trustees to quit eventually.
   Trustee Nira H. Long agreed to resign as the board's chairwoman
on Friday but said she would remain as a member.
   The students had Mayor Marion Barry's help and support until
Wednesday afternoon, when he bowed out, saying two attorneys
advising the students had talked them into refusing to compromise.
   But Thompson, said the students are in charge of the protest,
not the lawyers.
   Stanley said he and other school officials were willing to make
changes.
   ``We are prepared to admit that perhaps we and our predecessors
have been somewhat remiss in governance of this institution,'' he
said. ``We are more than willing to review the issues of governance
of the University of the District of Columbia with all aspects of
the university community.''

<HEAD>French Reactor Flaws Revealed as Pro-Nuclear Forum Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists challenged the safety of France's
big nuclear power network Saturday, a day after the end of an
international conference touting nuclear energy as crucial to
global development.
   France has 50 nuclear power plants and obtains a higher portion
of its electricity from nuclear power - more than 70 percent - than
any country in the world.
   Leaders of the ecology-oriented Green Party accused energy
authorities of lax response to investigations by safety experts,
who this week reported finding flaws in the water filtration
systems at 17 French reactors.
   Officials said the flaws posed no immediate danger, and would be
fixed during a series of shutdowns at the affected plants.
   On Friday, as the extent of the defects became known, more than
2,000 scientists, engineers and energy experts from 30 countries
ended the week-long European Nuclear Conference in Lyon.
   Several speakers, asserting the importance of nuclear power,
invoked the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis on the world oil
market.
   ``The only existing possibility is nuclear energy, if we don't
want to go toward major energy crises,'' said Remy Carle, a deputy
director of state-run Electricite de France, which operates the
nuclear power system.
   He said standardized global safety regulations and better
technical cooperation would help alleviate worries about nuclear
safety.
   Defects in water filtration circuits were first detected at the
Golfech plant near Toulouse in January. Authorities have been
criticized for not determining until this month that the same flaws
existed at 16 other 1,300-megawatt reactors.
   Said Michel Laveyrie, head of the safety service that pursued
the investigation: ``I'm not shocked that there were anomalies in
the system - nothing can be 100 percent perfect. But when you find
one, you must treat it rigorously. This wasn't the case.''
   Greens leader Antoine Waechter, at a news conference, denounced
France's ``nuclear dictatorship'' and said officials ``lied by
omission'' by failing to reveal the extent of the problems.
   Robert Malgras, a regional councilor in Lorraine in eastern
France, called Saturday for a meeting between the area's mayors and
nuclear safety officials to discuss the flaws found at the area's
Cattenom plant.
   ``We can't be content with an annual report,'' he said. ``We
want to know what's going on.''

   Some Christian fundamentalists believe the current crisis in the
Middle East may herald Armageddon and the Second Coming of Jesus.
   Here are some biblical passages some evangelicals cite as
evidence the final battle between the Lord and the enemies of
Israel, and the coming of the savior, may be near at hand. The
ancient city of Babylon is within present-day Iraq; ``Gog,'' in the
view of some, is a surrogate term for Babylon. The quotations come
from the New Oxford Annotated Bible, Revised Standard Version.
   
   From Isaiah 13:1-6:
   The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
On a bare hill raise a signal, cry aloud to them; wave the hand for
them to enter the gates of the nobles.
   I myself have commanded my consecrated ones, have summoned my
mighty men to execute my anger, my proudly exulting ones.
   Hark, a tumult on the mountains as of a great multitude! Hark,

<HEAD>Californians Face Vote on Curbing, Extending Tax Revolt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN GRUBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California voters will decide Nov. 6
whether the tax revolt they started a dozen years ago with
Proposition 13 is dead.
   The 28 propositions on the statewide ballot include three
proposed tax increases and 14 bond issues that would increase state
debt by $5.8 billion. But another measure would disallow any tax
increase approved by less than a two-thirds majority of voters,
substantially strengthening the anti-tax movement.
   The voters also will decide whether to ban cancer-causing
pesticides, take new steps aimed at saving ancient redwoods, throw
out veteran lawmakers and put prisoners to work.
   The $5.8 billion in bond proposals come just five months after
voters approved $5.1 billion in state bonds on the June primary
ballot.
   The November bond measures would go for forest preservation,
housing loans, universities, schools, prisons, jails, juvenile
halls, county courthouses, water and sewer projects, parks and
child care centers.
   Tax measures include proposals to increase the state sales tax
by a half-cent and to raise the state tax on alcoholic beverages.
But a rival initiative, backed by the alcohol industry, could wipe
out those tax increases.
   Reflecting a growing public disdain for politicians as shown by
the recent vote in Oklahoma to limit politicians' time in office,
two initiatives would turn out state elected officials after two to
six terms, depending on the measure and office.
   Local ballot propositions range from a measure to roll back rent
controls in Berkeley to a $1.2 million bond issue to purchase land
for a butterfly habitat in affluent Pacific Grove.
   A plan to move the San Francisco Giants 40 miles south to
suburban Santa Clara depends on a Santa Clara County vote on a
utility users tax to finance a proposed stadium for the National
League baseball team.
   Four environmental measures on the statewide ballot pit
conservationists and Hollywood celebrities against farmers,
chemical manufacturers, loggers and timber companies.
   One sweeping initiative could affect how much Californians pay
for food and energy, how many trees are planted in their
neighborhoods and whether their take-out hamburgers keep warm in a
foam box. It also could regulate their air conditioning and require
cars to average 50 miles per gallon of fuel by 2010.
   Dubbed ``Big Green'' by its backers, Proposition 128 would phase
out pesticides known to cause cancer, ban chemicals that harm the
ozone and require a dramatic reduction in emissions of gases that
contribute to global warming.
   It also would authorize $300 million in bonds to preserve
old-growth redwood trees, restrict offshore oil drilling and create
a new elective office of environmental czar.
   Opponents call Proposition 128 ``The Hayden Initiative,'' after
one of its chief sponsors, Tom Hayden, the student anti-war leader
of the 1960s who as a 50-year-old state assemblyman has refocused
his activism on environmental issues.
   Another measure sponsored by environmentalists seeks to save
old-growth forests. It would restrict clear-cutting of timber,
impose new restrictions on logging and prohibit exports of logs
harvested from state forests. It also would provide $742 million in
bond financing to preserve old-growth forests and retrain timber
workers who might be forced out of work by its harvesting
restrictions.
   Two rival measures backed by industry offer less restrictive
regulation of pesticides and logging.
   If two questions on the same subject pass, they both take
effect, except for provisions that conflict. In that case, the
courts have ruled, the measure with the highest vote total
prevails.
   Proposition 134, a ``nickel-a-drink'' surtax on wine, beer and
liquor, would earmark the extra $760 million a year for drug and
alcohol programs, health care and law enforcement. An
industry-backed rival, Proposition 126, would raise the tax by a
smaller amount, roughly a penny a drink.
   Proposition 133 would raise the state sales tax by one-half cent
per dollar for four years. The $1.5 billion to $2.1 billion in
annual revenues would go for anti-drug education, drug treatment,
prisons and jails.
   But Proposition 136, which would take effect election day, could
nullify the alcohol and sales tax measures by amending the state
constitution to require a two-thirds vote for ballot measures that
raise special taxes.
   The question of whether such a proposition could actually
nullify another vote taken the same day, or could be applied only
to future propositions, would probably be decided in the courts.
   Proposition 136 is supported by followers of the late anti-tax
crusaders Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann. Opponents say the real
backers are alcohol interests who want to defeat the liquor tax.
   Proposition 131 would limit the governor and other statewide
elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms. Legislators
would be limited to 12 years in office.
   It also would set new limits on campaign contributions,
establish partial public financing for state campaigns, restrict
closed meetings of the Legislature and create a new political
corruption prosecutor.
   Under Proposition 140, the governor and most other state
officials down to senator could each serve up to eight years.
Assembly members would be limited to six years. It also would
eliminate legislative pensions and cut the Legislature's budget by
about 40 percent.

<HEAD>Polish Senate Approves Laws on Presidential Election, Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Saturday unanimously
approved legislation to hold a popular presidential election as
early as Nov. 25.
   The legislation, already passed Thursday by the lower chamber of
Parliament - the Sejm - includes a constitutional amendment in
which the president is elected in a general vote to a five-year
term. It also includes an election law authorizing the Parliament
speaker to set a date for the elections.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has already declared his candidacy
in the first popular presidential balloting here in more than 50
years to succeed Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who is stepping down
early as head of state.
   Walesa is likely to face Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, his
former adviser, in the presidential race. Mazowiecki is expected to
announce his candidacy within days.
   According to Piotr Nowina-Konopka, a minister of state in the
office of the president, Jaruzelski planned to sign the legislation
immediately and the Sejm speaker is expected to announce the
election date as early as this weekend.
   ``The first round of presidential elections can be held Nov.
25,'' Konopka told the official PAP news agency, stressing the law
requires election dates to be announced 45 days in advance.
   Jaruzelski asked the parliament Sept. 19 to shorten his six-year
term in order to allow a free presidential election following calls
for the former Communist Party head to step down.
   He had been elected president by the two-chamber National
Assembly in July 1989.
   Under this timetable, the new president would be sworn in before
Dec. 25.

<HEAD>Hungarian Police Ban Demonstration by the Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Saturday banned a
demonstration at Southern Railway Station by Budapest's homeless
people.
   No disturbances were reported following the ban, issued after a
meeting Friday of the state railway authority, which says Budapest
railway stations have now become overnight havens for the homeless.
   The number of homeless is increasing rapidly here as an annual
inflation rate of 30 percent starts to hurt those living on fixed
incomes, such as pensioners, and with the emptying of prisons
through government amnesties.
   Peter Gyeori, a sociologist, told Hungarian radio Saturday the
problem is also increasingly a refugee issue.
   ``Refugees from all over Eastern Europe, many of them with
children, sleep in railway stations in Budapest,'' he said.
   Last winter, several homeless people were found frozen to death.
The magnitude of the problem is expected to worsen this winter.
   The Welfare Ministry this week set up a special office to manage
the ``social crisis'' in Hungary.
   Its head, Zoltan Lackner, told reporters the problem of the
homeless will be up to the new local governments to be elected in
nationwide balloting Sunday.
   Lackner told radio Saturday the government has allocated the
equivalent of an extra $500,000 to finance soup kitchens and
hostels for the growing number of poor until January.
   Maria Komar, a Budapest City Hall official, earlier told the
daily Nepszabadsag that $500,000 already allocated for the poor
this year has been used up.

<HEAD>Police in Yugoslavia Clash With Ethnic Protesters; 27 Detained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IVAN STEFANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic protesters clashed with
police reinforcements Saturday after seizing police weapons in two
Croatian towns, and at least 27 people were detained, authorities
said. One policeman was injured.
   Croatia's Interior Ministry dispatched special police units to
the trouble spots south of the Croatian capital of Zagreb and
accused unnamed Serb politicians of encouraging what it called
``terrorist acts.''
   Serbs and Croats, Yugoslavia's two largest ethnic groups, have
been fierce rivals since the country was formed in 1918.
   With increasing ethnic, economic and political differences
tugging at Yugoslavia's fragile, six-republic federation, the
Serb-Croat rivalry is becoming more intense and violent.
   The center-right coalition that ousted the Communists in free
elections in Croatia last spring is pushing for a much looser
confederation of sovereign states in Yugoslavia.
   Serbia wants to maintain a more centralized system and vows to
protect the Serbs living in Croatia, if necessary by changing the
borders between the two republics.
   The Croatian Interior Ministry said shots were fired on police
Friday in Petrinja, about 25 miles south of Zagreb, when they used
tear gas and clubs against about 2,000 minority Serbs protesting
seizures of weapons issued to them as police reservists.
   One policeman was seriously injured and at least 27 of the 90
people identified as responsible for the unrest were detained, the
ministry said, according to the state news agency Tanjug.
   The local police chief was among those detained on suspicion of
``irresponsible work,'' Tanjug said.
   Tanjug also said about 1,000 angry Serbs from Dvor, 25 miles
south of Petrinja, and from nearby Bosanski Novi, in the republic
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, attacked Dvor's police station Friday night.
   The crowd overpowered police, who did not use their firearms.
They occupied the building and seized unspecified weapons and
ammunition, Tanjug said.
   The Serbs then barricaded roads leading into the town, Tanjug
said. Special police units eventually arrived after midnight,
retook the police station and began recovering the confiscated
weapons, Tanjug said.
   It did not say whether force was used, but it said all
approaches to the police station and town hall were blocked. Police
checked vehicles and passengers on access roads.
   In addition to the seizure of weapons at the police station,
Tanjug said the crowd stole hunting ammunition overnight from a
weapons shop in Dvor.
   ``The developments point to recklessness of gangs of bandits''
trying ``to start an armed uprising in the republic of Croatia,''
the Interior Ministry statement said.
   Tension is rising throughout Yugoslavia as the quarreling
republics and their leaders move toward a showdown over the
country's future.
   November's free elections in Bosnia-Hercegovina, which has
strong Serb, Croat and Moslem groups, and elections scheduled Dec.
9 in Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic, are expected to decide
whether the federation stays together or falls apart.
   Slovenia, which like Croatia elected a center-right government
in free elections in spring, also advocates a confederation.
Slovenia has threatened full independence if a new arrangement is
not found, and its parliament on Friday adopted measures bringing
the republic closer to rupture with the others.

   The Washington National Cathedral, begun at
the dawn of the century, was formally completed Saturday with
President Bush overseeing the laying of the final stone atop what
he called ``this symbol of our nation's spiritual life.''
   ``The fabric of this Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul
is completed,'' Richard T. Feller, canon of the clerk of the works,
announced to Bush and the thousands who gathered at the cathedral.
   Bush told the crowd, ``We have constructed here this symbol of
our nation's spiritual life, overlooking the center of our nation's
secular life. A symbol which combines the permanence of stone and
of God, both of which will outlast men, and memories.''
   The visitors crowded the grounds atop Mount St. Alban - the
capital city's highest point - to witness the end of a project
begun in 1907.
   Theodore Roosevelt was president when construction began on what
is now the world's sixth largest cathedral.
   Roosevelt watched the laying of the foundation stone, along with
10,000 people who braved chilly damp weather to join him.
   Saturday's celebrants gathered under sunny, warm skies on a day
that highlighted the grandeur of the Gothic-style cathedral's newly
visible facade. For years, the front, flanked by twin towers was
obscured from passers by on Wisconsin Avenue by massive
construction equipment and scaffolding.
   Today, the massive limestone church is set back impressively
from the broad avenue on 57 acres of landscaped grounds that also
house three schools, a college, the offices of the Episcopal
Diocese of Washington and St. Alban's Parish Church.
   Bush told the gathering the nation has come to the cathedral to
grieve, to understand, to celebrate and to express concern.
   He noted the funerals of presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight
Eisenhower and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey were held there.
   ``Over a three-day period at the dedication of the Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial, the names of 57,939 lost Americans were read in
chapels. Other times we listened to Bishop Tutu, Billy Graham and
Martin Luther King.''
   He also recalled ``when the hostages were freed from our embassy
in Iran, there was a service of thanksgiving.''
   ``We went to express our concern, to hold a memorial for victims
of the American embassy bombing in Beirut, a service of reflection
on the 40th anniversary of Hiroshima, and even now prayers for our
brave young servicemen and women in the harsh, distant deserts,''
he said, referring to troops in the Persian Gulf region.
   The final ceremonial stone was a 1,000-pound chunk of Indiana
limestone carved in the shape of a folded leaf or flower.
   It was lifted into place atop the southwest pinnacle of the
cathedral's St. Paul Tower.
   Feller directed the delicate crane operation in a voice
broadcast over loudspeaker. The crowd below erupted in cheers when
one of the two workmen exclaimed ``bull's eye!'' as the stone was
positioned over a mortar bed.
   Bush said the words spoken from the pulpit by the late Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in his last Sunday sermon ``should become
our new vision.''
   ``He said, `We will bring about a new day of justice and
brotherhood and peace. And on that day, morning stars will sing
together and sons of God will shout for joy.''
   The 873,021-square foot cathedral, in 14th century Gothic style,
is bested in size only by: St. Peter's in Rome, the world's
largest, followed by one in Seville, Spain, the unfinished St. John
the Divine in New York and cathedrals in Liverpool, England, and
Milan, Italy.
   It is officially named the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St.
Paul.
   Feller said in a recent interview that he believes it will be
the last built in the Gothic style because that type of
craftsmanship is no longer available.
   He had said ``only the most optimistic person would have bet on
the Washington cathedral ever being finished.''
   In 1981 the Protestant-Episcopal Foundation had fallen $10.7
million in debt and work on the church stopped. But a fundraising
drive revived the project and the final phase of the nearly
century-long project began in 1983.
   The 150,000-ton church was built in the traditional
stone-on-stone method of the medieval cathedral builders, although
with modern equipment. The bearing walls are supported by stone
buttresses.
   President Woodrow Wilson is buried there. So is Helen Keller,
whose memorial is in braille.
   Work on the cathedral was halted during World War I and World
War II and stopped again in 1977 because of a shortage of funds. It
was resumed in 1980.

<TEXT>
   A Kuwaiti businessman said Saturday that
he saw Iraqi soldiers summarily execute eight men accused of
resistance activities in occupied Kuwait.
   The eight were ``murdered by Iraqi soldiers who shot them with
pistols,'' said the businessman, who spoke through a satellite
telephone conversation - a rarity in this region since the Aug. 2
takeover of Kuwait by Iraq's forces.
   ``Each victim was killed with one bullet in the head and another
in the heart,'' he said, adding that the killings occurred Sept.
21.
   The same day, the Iraqis rounded up 17 businessmen and former
parliamentarians on charges of refusing to cooperate with the
occupation authorities, said the businessman, who spoke on
condition his name was not used.
   The 17 included Faisal al-Sanie, former parliamentarian and
member of the opposition group that had been demanding more
democracy in Kuwait, along with businessmen brothers Khaled, Adnan
and Salah al-Wasmi, he said.
   ``They were arrested and moved along with their families to
unknown places, possibly to Iraq,'' he said. ``Also last week, the
Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society was closed and the six members of its
board board were seized and taken away.''
   The Red Crescent officers were taken to the southern Iraqi Basra
region, he said.
   The report was the latest reaching Bahrain from the estimated
300,000 Kuwaitis living under Iraqi occupation.
   ``Things are getting real bad here,'' said the businessman.
``Food is scarce and the Iraqis are becoming extremely ferocious.
''
   He said the Kuwaiti resistance ``is doing a good job, but not
good enough.''
   ``Our beloved and beautiful Kuwait has been reduced to a
shambles. In daytime the city is like a cemetry, oppressive and
silent,'' he said. ``After sunset, we hear only the sound of death
- the rattle of machine-gun fire, the thud of cannons and blasts of
bombs.''
   The telephone connection was clear. The businessman sounded
tired and shaken, saying, ``It's a big risk making this call. They
(Iraqis) kill Kuwaitis in cold blood.''
   Regular telephone and Telex links between Kuwait and the rest of
the world were cut off in the first days of the invasion.
   The exiled ruler of the invaded country, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, gave President Bush a graphic account of the situation in
the country under the Iraqi occupation.
   As a result of these reports and other accounts of violence and
pillaging, Bush is reviewing the possibility of seeking additional
United Nations action beyond the existing trade blockade, according
to Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
   Scowcroft said Friday that military action was one possibility.
   Kuwaitis fleeing since the invasion have been providing frequent
accounts of oppression, rape and plunder by the Iraqi occupation
forces. The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
recently sent a team to the gulf to try to investigate the reports.
   The businessman's report was the first about an Iraqi crackdown
on members of the opposition ranks in Kuwait who had been on a
collision course with the Emir over the months seeking the return
of a Western-style parliament. But they had always affirmed loyalty
to the Emir.
   At the start of the Iraqi invasion there were claims that Kuwait
opposition leaders would be asked to form a government to run their
country when the Iraqis withdrew. Instead, Baghdad announced the
formation of a 9-member ``Provisional Kuwait Free Government'' led
by an obscure Col. Alaa Hussein Ali.
   Other Kuwaiti refugees reaching Bahrain said that they saw Alaa
on television with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, requesting unity
between their two countries. The same day, Kuwait was annexed by
Iraq and Alaa was never seen again, and was presumed executed, they
said.

<HEAD>Vet's Mistake: Boy Watches as Dog in for Rabies Vaccination is Put
to Sleep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-age boy who brought his beloved
dog in for a rabies vaccination watched as his pet was mistakenly
put to sleep.
   ``It was a real tragedy, very serious,'' said Dr. Keith
Sultemeier, the veterinarian who operates the clinic in Azle,
northwest of Fort Worth.
   Fifteen-year-old Tony McCarty and his mother brought the dog, a
2{-year-old pit bull-chow mixbreed named Runt, into the clinic
Thursday, about the same time a female pit bull-chow mix was
brought in for euthanasia, Sultemeier said. ``The lady and her son
came in with a dog for a fairly straightforward vaccination and
walked out without the dog. ... We are at fault,'' the veterinarian
said.
   The boy was with Runt when the dog got the lethal injection
instead of the rabies shot. To make up for the error, Sultemeier
bought McCarty a full-blooded chow puppy.
   McCarty's mother, Pam Peyton, said she won't sue Sultemeier.
   ``I don't see any reason to ruin his practice over this,'' she
said. ``He's gotten us a new dog and said he will take steps -
whatever that means - to make sure it doesn't happen again and I
believe he will.''

<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem leader on
Saturday pointed to renewed ties between Tehran and London and said
Washington should ``improve its conduct'' to help win the freedom
of six American captives.
   Te leader, Hussein Musawi, said he does not expect the ``early
release'' of any of the U.S. hostages - ``not before Americans
improve their conduct like the British started doing.''
   Britain and Iran restored diplomatic ties Thursday, 18 months
after severing relations following Iran's death decree against
author Salman Rushdie, a British citizen. Iran's late Ayatollah
Khomeini said Rushdie should be killed because his novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' defamed Islam.
   If any American were freed, Musawi said, it ought to be Terry
Anderson, the longest-held foreign captive. Anderson, 42, the chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   ``I hope that Anderson will be the first to be releasd when
conditions are ripe for American hostage to be freed,'' Musawi
said.
   ``The Americans should apologize to the Moslems for their
traditional support for Israel. They should withdraw from the
(Persian) Gulf,'' he said. ``They should release Iranian funds.
They should treat Moslems with respect.''
   Asked if he had any information on Anderson's whereabouts or
health condition, Musawi said: ``No one heard that there is
anything (wrong) with Anderson's health.''
   Musawi hinted that one of the four British hostages might be
freed as a result of the renewal of the renewed diplomatic ties
between Britain and Iran, but said he did not have ``accurate
information'' on any specific plans to free one of them.
   Asked about former Irish hostage Brian Keenan's contention that
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite had fallen ill in captivity,
Musawi said: ``I don't know anything about Terry Waite except what
we read in the press attributed to Keenan ... I hope he is in good
health.''
   Waite, 51, personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut for a meeting with a representative of Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the underground faction believed to
hold Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   No group has claimed responsibility for Waite's abduction, but
Keenan, released in August, said he was held with the Anglican
envoy for a while in the same house.
   The Westerners are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
groups. Musawi denied his Islamic Amal Movement group was holding
hostages, but said the Islamic leadership in Iran ``is the only
force outside Lebanon that can influence these special Islamic
security groups.''
   The 13 Western captives, in addition to the six Americans and
four Britons, also include two West Germans and an Italian.

<HEAD>Bush Celebrates Laying of Final Stone at National Cathedral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
at the celebration of the completion of the Washington National
Cathedral on Saturday.
   
   Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.
Thank you all. Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you,
Bishop Browning.
   Please -- thank you, Bishop Browning, and a -- it's a great
pleasure to be with you again. And a special thanks to Bishop
Haines and special thanks to Colonel Broussard and our wonderful
Marine Band.
   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
   And a warm welcome to all of you out there, standing and seated,
in this splendid scene of bright unity across these gorgeous
grounds: the clergy and other interfaith leaders, members of this
great Washington National Cathedral, representatives of our
government and other countries, and the men and women who have
worked on this magnificent structure and all our friends.
   Barbara and I feel privileged -- privileged to be with you on
this day of ecumenical thanksgiving.
   There's one man, mentioned by Bishop Browning, who's gone before
us, yet who is in so many of our hearts today, the late Episcopal
Bishop of Washington, John Walker.
   Like many of you here, I treasured his friendship and I valued
his counsel. And were he still with us, the stone-setting would be
the culmination of his life's work and his life's dream.
   But tomorrow, on the first anniversary of his death, the very
first service will be held in the completed cathedral, and I'd like
to dedicate these remarks to his memory.
   What an extraordinary moment this is! Eighty-three years ago,
this day, this hour, our predecessors here laid a cornerstone. And
now, eight decades later, we look at Mount St. Alban, and say,
``Here, we have built our church.''
   Not just a church -- a house of prayer for a nation, built on
the rock of religious faith, a nation we ceebrate as one nation
under God, a nation whose founding president, George Washington,
said ``No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the
invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the
people of the United States.''
   And so, we have constructed here this symbol of our nation's
spiritual life, overlooking the center of our nation's secular
life, a symbol which combines the permanence of stone and of God,
both of which will outlast men and memories; a symbol that carries
with it a constant reminder of our moral obligations.
   You know, whenever I look up at this hill and see the Cathedral
keeping watch over us, I feel the challenges reaffirmed.
   Woodrow Wilson's last public words, inscribed here on the wall
next to his tomb, say it best. ``Our civilization cannot survive
materially unless it be redeemed spiritually.''
   To do that, we must govern by the imperatives of a strong moral
compass, a compass based on the kind of purity and vision and
values that inspired our early founders, a compass that would lead
us to enter this building through its oldest door, the way of
peace.
   And a compass oriented to the words of Saint Paul, who gazes
down from our left: ``And now abideth faith, hope and love, these
three; but the greatest of these is love.''
   Our personal family compass has for many years led us here for
public and private worship. We were neighbors when we lived at the
Vice President's residence, and before that our children went to
school at St. Albans. And I was a board member at National
Cathedral School, and Ken and Martin baptized one of our
grandchildren, and two sons were confirmed here; and Barbara has
even read the Christmas story.
   I'll stop in case each of you want to tell me of your family
connection with this wonderful institution.
   One of the high points of our inaugural weekend was the prayer
service here, part of a national day of prayer across the country.
   I want to take a moment to say goodbye to Provost Perry, Charles
Perry, who so beautifully organized that service, and who is
leaving tomorrow after a dozen years of devoted work.
   And I would like to share with you some thoughts on why we find
this Cathedral so moving.
   To begin with, there is profound meaning in the physical beauty.
The devout say they can see here the invisible hand of God in the
visible handiwork of man.
   We all can see, in this astonishing place of stone and light, a
massive, 300 million-pound mountain of Indiana limestone created as
an act of worship.
   I want my grandchildren to come here. I want them to feel
reassured that there always will be comfort here in the presence of
God, and I want them to delight in the colors and the sounds and
the tapestries and mosaics to the fine old hymns.
   And I want them to know a very special way of understanding this
wondrous place, studying the brilliant stained glass windows. From
where we now stand, the rose window high above seems black and
formless to some, perhaps. But when we enter and see it backlit by
the sun, it dazzles in astonishing splendor.
   And it reminds us that without faith, we too are but stained
glass windows in the dark.

   But the magnificent story of this place, then, is human as well
as spiritual. The greatness of this masterpiece comes from the
loving and sometimes lifelong dedication of the finest craftsmen.
   For some it has been a multigenerational work, son following son
throughout the birth of this house of worship.
   Many of these workers are now gone. For their memorial, simply
look around you.
   But most of the gifts that made this great American dream a
reality -- gifts of funds, work, love, spirit and prayer -- were
from the people who are its congregation, the millions across
America.
   They caught the exhilaration of the dream that seized those who
envisioned this cathedral and yet who didn't live to see it a
reality -- men like Pierre L'Enfant, whose 1791 plan for Washington
included a great church ``for national purposes''; or Henry
Satterlee, this city's first Episcopal bishop, who yearned for a
place ``forever open and free''; and the members of Congress, who
voted the 1893 Charter of Foundation.
   There are some here who share that dream in a unique way. They
were also here 83 years ago today for the laying of the
cornerstone, and they remember sunlight shining through the rain
while 10,000 watched and cheered.
   For instance, Elsie Brown is now 90, but was seven when her
mother took her to that event.
   Ninty-five-year-old Taylor Eicher was 12 when he donned his
cassock to sing in the boy's choir that noon. And Ruth Oliphant,
now 98, walked over with her other 15-year-old cathedral school
classmates.
   It was a very American ceremony. President Teddy Roosevelt
spoke, and Bishop Satterlee tapped the stone with the gavel which
George Washington had used to set the cornerstone of the United
States Capitol.
   That was only right for a cathedral whose style is 14th century
Gothic and yet also very much American, a cathedral that's not just
about faith, but was also about a nation and its people. A
cathedral where mosaics of the great seal of the United States and
the state seals are set into the floors, where bays honor
Washington, Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, where you
can find an eagle, a bison, and even a stained -- stained-glass
codfish.
   Or needlepoint memorials or to Herman Melville, Alexander Graham
Bell, Harriet Tubman and John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Where lie the
graves of President Wilson, Admiral George Dewey, and Helen Keller.
   Where the mesmerizing stained-glass space window included
--includes a moon rock, given by Astronaut Michael Collins who went
to school on these very grounds at St. Albans.
   And where an unexpected shaft of sun can leave a stunning
memory. The statue of George Washington, strong and solid and
earth-bound, suddenly dappled by the brilliance of stained-glass
light.
   It's a place where the history of the cathedral and of the
country have been interwoven.
   When we need to grieve, we come here. We held funerals for
Presidents Truman and Eisenhower and Vice President Humphrey, the
burial of President Wilson, and a fantastic memorial service for
Winston Churchill.
   When we want to understand, we come here. Over a three-day
period at the dedication of the Vietnam memorial, the names of
57,939 lost Americans were read in chapels.
   Other times, we listened to Bishop Tutu or Billy Graham or
Martin Luther King.
   When we want to celebrate, we come here. When the hostages were
freed from our Embassy in Tehran, there was a service of
thanksgiving and later a national prayer service for the 50th
presidential inauguration.
   And bells peal out on the national holidays.
   When we want to express our concern we come here to hold a
memorial for victims of the American embassy bombing in Beirut, a
service of reflection on the 40th anniversary of Hiroshima, and
even now, prayers for our brave young service men and women in the
harsh, distant deserts.
   And so today, we prepare to raise that final 100 -- 1,008 pound
grand finial to its spot on one of the great pinnacles of St.
Paul's Tower -- the last step in an eight-decade-long journey.
   And now that our national treasure is complete, how will it fit
into our lives?
   I would love to see the entire country discover this cathedral
as America's resource, refuge and reminder somewhere to strengthen
the nation's heart. We should consecrate this place in the words of
Isaiah. ``For mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all
people,'' -- all people, all America.
   And we should come here to pledge ourselves to the work of
Martin Luther King envisioned from the splendid Canterbury pulpit
in his last sermon three days before he died, and he said, ``We
will bring about a new day of justice and brotherhood and peace,
and on that day, morningstars will sing together, and the sons of
God will shout for joy.''
   For eight decades, the dream of a completed cathedral dominated
this hill, and now Dr. King's words should become our new vision.
   Eighty-three years ago on this spot, President Teddy Roosevelt
said, `God speed the work begun this noon.''
   And today I say, God speed the work completed this noon, and the
new work yet to begin.
   God bless all of you, this magnificent cathedral and the United
States of America. Thank you all very much.

In Deaths</HEAD>

   The strangled bodies of two women dumped in
a trash bin last year were identified as the wife and mother-in-law
of a New Jersey police officer already charged with murder in their
deaths.
   Diane Palumbo Woodrow, 32, and Yolanda Palumbo, 67, both of
Williamstown, N.J., were identified Friday after a review of dental
records and forensic evidence from an autopsy, Maryland state
police said.
   The bodies were discovered Aug. 12, 1989, in a trash bin at the
rear of a Joppatowne shopping center.
   Sgt. Andrew J. Woodrow, 26, a six-year veteran of the Woodbury,
N.J., police department, was indicted Sept. 13 in New Jersey for
murder. Over the past year, the indictment charges, he cashed 13
Social Security checks issued to his mother-in-law, worth more than
$5,000.
   Confirming that the bodies found in Maryland were Mrs. Woodrow
and Mrs. Palumbo bolstered the prosecution's case, said Gloucester
County Prosecutor Richard Hickey III.
   ``We are obviously in much better shape now,'' Hickey said.
   A judge on Friday refused to reduce Woodrow's $500,000 cash
bail, noting that Woodrow, if convicted, could be sentenced to
death. He is being held at the Ocean County Jail in Toms River,
N.J.
   Woodrow and his wife, married in 1986, lived with Mrs. Palumbo
at her Williamstown mobile home, Hickey said. Woodrow continued to
live in the mobile home, before moving to West Deptford, N.J., in
April, the prosecutor said.
   Woodrow was described as a model officer who climbed the ranks
in his six years with the Woodbury force. He was promoted to
sergeant last May.
   ``He was one of our better officers,'' said Woodbury Police
Chief Craig Hoelbinger. ``It's shocking and hard to believe this
could happen.''

<HEAD>Six Killed in Factional Fighting in South Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six blacks were killed in two
clashes Saturday, including three youths who died when
gasoline-soaked tires were put around their necks and set ablaze,
police said.
   A large group of blacks assaulted the three youths, aged 19, 18,
and 16, then killed them by the ``necklace'' method Saturday
morning in Evaton, a black township south of Johannesburg, police
said.
   Authorities gave no motive for the attack, but rival black
factions have been battling in townships outside Johannesburg since
early August, leaving about 800 dead.
   Also, three blacks were shot dead in the Crossroads community
outside Cape Town in an ongoing battle between squatters and
residents in formal brick houses, police said.
   In other developments, a right-wing white in detention without
charge told supporters to accept a government offer granting
amnesty to people who surrendrr illegal weapons.
   Piet Rudolph, deputy leader of the Boer State Party, said ``this
call does not mean ... I have given up the struggle for our
freedom.''
   But in a letter released by police, Rudolph conceded that ``no
one with a few guns will be able to obtain the declared goal of ...
the overthrow of the government.''
   The Boer State Party is one of several right-wing groups that
want strict apartheid and have vowed to resist President F.W. de
Klerk's plans to share power with the black majority.
   Rudolph was arrested Sept. 17 after several months in hiding.
While underground, he declared war on the government and claimed
responsibility for bomb attacks on offices of de Klerk's ruling
National Party.
   Meanwhile, African National Congress leaders said Saturday that
apartheid was dying, but the government was still attempting to
undermine the ANC.
   ``The government has got a double agenda,'' ANC treasurer Thomas
Nkobi said in Cape Town. ``One is to negotiate with the ANC for the
purposes of responding to international pressure, and two,
promoting nationwide violence to weaken the ANC.''
   Nkobi and other ANC leaders addressed delegates at regional
conferences in Cape Town and Johannesburg. They were the first such
ANC conferences in South Africa since 1959, the year before the ANC
was outlawed. The ANC, the largest black opposition group, was
legalized in February.
   The government has denied charges that police have fueled
fighting between the ANC and the rival Inkatha movement in the
townships outside Johannesburg.
   The government points to a sharp decrease in the fighting since
emergency police measures were announced two weeks ago.
   In Johannesburg, ANC leader Walter Sisulu told delegates that
apartheid was near its end.
   ``The period we find ourselves in is ripe for the transfer of
power to the people,'' he said.

   Does Nessie, Scotland's fabled Loch Ness
monster, have a cousin?
   A handful of sightings of huge serpentlike creatures in Lake
Erie were recorded in 1985 and 1987. But things remained quiet
until Sept. 4.
   That's when Harold Bricker and his family returned from a
fishing trip with a new sighting, and monster mania began spreading
along lakefront communities.
   The Brickers said they saw a large creature moving in the water
about 1,000 feet from their boat. They described it as black, about
35 feet long and with a snakelike head. It moved as fast as their
boat.
   ``I told my son that I wanted to get a look at it,'' the
67-year-old Bricker said. ``My son said, `No way, that thing is
bigger than we are.' So we stayed where we were.''
   Bricker, his wife, Cora, and son, Robert, told rangers at East
Harbor State Park about what they'd seen.
   The creature has since been reported by five people on three
separate occasions, including a Huron firefighter and a 50-year-old
woman from Pennsylvania vacationing at her Lake Erie cottage.
   John Schaffner, editor of a weekly newspaper in Port Clinton,
has set up a toll-free phone for people to call if they see the
serpent.
   He also ran a contest to name it. South Bay Besse was chosen in
part because of the location of the Davis Besse nuclear power plant
near Port Clinton - not to mention that Besse rhymes with
``Nessie.''
   The story of the monster in Loch Ness in north-central Scotland
dates back centuries and is worth tens of millions in tourist
dollars to the region each year. Three years ago, a million-dollar
scientific expedition to find her turned up just vague sonar
readings, but the legend remains.
   Any similar effort to find a creature in Lake Erie would be even
more difficult - at 240 miles, it's more than 10 times as long as
Loch Ness.
   Thomas Solberg, owner of Huron Lagoon Marina, has offered a
$5,000 reward to anyone who captures South Bay Besse alive. He also
posted a sign at his marina calling it the future home of the Lake
Erie sea serpent.
   But while some people are having fun with the creature, marine
researchers remain skeptical.
   Fred Snyder, a researcher with the Ohio Sea Grant, an
organization that examines Great Lakes issues, said it is highly
unlikely a monster is living in Lake Erie.
   He added that he's ``not trying to be the sour old guy who
throws a bucket of water on things'' and loves stories about the
Loch Ness monster.
   But he noted that Loch Ness is old, while Lake Erie is a
youngster, geologically speaking.
   ``A lot of people kind of assume, like most places in the world,
it must be millions and millions of years old,'' he said. ``It's
not the case. The glaciers receded and the area stabilized about
12,000 years ago, which, geologically, is just yesterday.
   ``So the monster really can't be anything left over from the
dinosaur days, because it's just too young.''
   Snyder also noted that no sightings were reported before the
mid-1980s. And he said he doubts a big sea creature could have
gotten in from the Atlantic Ocean because of the difficulties of
navigating the St. Lawrence Seaway.
   The sturgeon, Lake Erie's largest fish, can grow to 300 pounds
and 10 feet in length, but it is on the endangered species list and
is a bottom dweller, Snyder said.
   He speculated monster sighters may have seen a school of fish
and mistakenly thought it was a creature.
   ``I truthfully don't know what people have been seeing, but it's
hard for me to believe that there could be a monster out there,''
he said.

<HEAD>Last Cruise On President Riverboat Is End Of An Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest excursion riverboat still plying
the waters of the Mississippi casts off on its final
dinner-and-dancing cruise tonight before opening a new chapter in
river history as the nation's largest floating casino.
   First thing Monday morning, workers will start tearing up the
insides of the 57-year-old President, a national historic landmark.
They'll rip out the huge polished hard maple dance floor, the
carpeting, the tiles.
   Come April, after a $10 million facelift, the President will
re-emerge with 27,000 square feet of gaming space - more than some
Las Vegas or Atlantic City casinos.
   ``It's going to dazzle them,'' Capt. Bob Goodman said.
   Goodman sat recently at a table in the ballroom on the boat's
main deck and described his mixed feelings about the boat's future.
   ``The thing that really tears me up is that dance floor's going
to come up - that's the heart and soul of this boat. You can just
imagine the proposals that have been made, the sweet nothings that
have been whispered on that floor,'' said Goodman, who has worked
on the boat since 1985. ``Literally millions of people have danced
on this floor.''
   The old riverboat holds fond memories for George and Margery
Perry, who have been doing the ballroom fox trot on the President
for at least 25 years.
   ``We've been referred to as the black Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers,'' said Perry, 70.
   The President's history dates back to 1924, when it was a
sidewheel steamboat called the Cincinnati, an overnight packet boat
carrying freight and passengers from Cincinnati to Louisville.
   As more of the nation's transportation needs were handled by the
expanding railroad, Streckfus Steamers in St. Louis bought the
boat, and transformed it into the President, the country's first
all-steel riverboat.
   Five decks tall and nearly a football field long, the President
conducted daytime and moonlight excursions in St. Louis during the
spring and summer and in New Orleans during the fall and winter
from 1933 to 1940.
   In 1941, the President took up official residence in New
Orleans, returning to St. Louis only when nww 2,000 horsepower
diesel engines were installed in 1978, replacing the paddlewheels.
   In 1985, the deteriorating riverboat was bought by John E.
Connelly, a Pittsburgh-based riverboat entrepreneur and developer,
and was returned to St. Louis.
   ``The first time I saw the President, I said `That's a
riverboat. That's a real boat,''' Goodman said. ``I fell in love
with it.''
   After renovation, she'll be based in Davenport, Iowa. The Iowa
law legalizing riverboat gambling takes effect next April. The boat
will feature 680 slot machines and 32 gaming tables.
   ``Can you imagine, all that floating on the Mississippi River,
with all the glamour and allure of the river and gambling?''
Connelly said. ``I'm very excited. She's had a great past and I
think her future is very bright.''
   It will be the end of an era for Israel ``Izzy'' Gorman, who has
worked on the President since 1939, when he was 10 years old and
working as a captain's boy for Capt. Roy Streckfus.
   Through the years, Gorman has met such entertainers as Louis
Armstrong, Fats Domino, Al Hirt, Chuck Berry and many others who
have worked the President.
   But Gorman was more philosophical than sad about the President's
last cruise.
   ``Regardless of how they change it, it's still the same boat.
It's not laid up in some dirty old wharf or what not. She's still
sailing, still living, and I'm proud of that.
   ``Everybody needs a new suit once in a while.''

   A senior Iraqi official denied Saturday
that foreigners would be deprived of food supplies when a rationing
system begins this week.
   Iraqi officials had threatened last week to withhold food from
non-Arab foreigners starting Monday.
   But on Saturday, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, minister of trade and
finance, told the Iraqi News Agency that rationing would provide
basic foodstuffs in equal share for ``for Iraqis, Arabs, diplomatic
missions, foreigners working in Iraq and all those who arrived as
guests of Iraq without any preferential treatment for any group,''
   ``Guests of Iraq'' is the term Baghdad applies to Westerners who
have been taken to strategic sites to serve as shields against
potential military attack.
   ``There are no instructions whatsoever to deprive any foreign
nationals of the right to benefit from the ration card system, as
claimed by some hostile and suspicious media reports within the
context of their rabid campaign against Iraq,'' Saleh said.
   He accused foreign governments of embarking on a ``smear
campaign against Iraq's treatment of the foreigners.''
   Iraqi leaders had said Wednesday they would cut off food to
non-Arabs in the country, and announced at the same time they
planned to extend nationwide rationing to rice, flour, sugar, tea
and cooking oil. Bread is already rationed.
   Word of the planned food cutoff came from diplomats speaking on
condition of anonymity, who quoted a Foreign Ministry memorandum as
saying rations would be suspended because of the latest U.N.
Security Council resolution It imposed an air embargo on Iraq.
   The memorandum was delivered to all non-Arab missions.
   ``We received a memorandum explaining that the government's
priority is to feed the Iraqi population,'' a Western diplomat
said. They said they contacted Arab diplomats who told them they
had not received any such notice.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
his counterpart from Vietnam on Saturday, taking a step toward
normalizing relations severed since the Vietnam War.
   They were the highest-level talks between the two countries
since the war ended in April 1975.
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, promised his
country would withdraw all its military advisers from Cambodia, but
he provided no timetable for the withdrawal.
   Baker offered to lift the usual travel restrictions on
Vietnamese diplomats, which limit them to a 25-mile radius of New
York City, so they can meet in Washington with relatives of
Americans missing in Vietnam.
   When asked if the talks were a step toward normalizing
relations, a senior State Department said: ``It would be fair to
say it was a step in that direction, although it did not constitute
commencement of normalization.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said restoration of
relations would depend on Vietnam's cooperation on two issues:
resolving the war in Cambodia and providing ``a full accounting''
of Americans missing since the Vietnam War.
   The official said progress on the Cambodian issue hinges on the
signature of a peace treaty in Paris by the parties to end the
conflict, and the implementation of a U.N. peace plan in which U.N.
administrators would run major Cambodian government ministries
until new elections are held.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, has withdrawn all or
most of its 140,000 troops from Cambodia, western intelligence
officials believe.
   It was not immediately known how many military advisers remain
in Cambodia, but the State Department official said there are
``more than dozens.''
   ``We have withdrawn our forces and we will withdraw all our
advisers,'' Thach said before the meeting with Baker. He added that
Vietnam had agreed to international monitoring in Cambodia.
   On the POW-MIA issue, the State Department official said Thach
would go to Washington to meet with Gen. John Vesey, President
Bush's special emissary on the issue, and with Anne Griffiths, head
of the National League of Families of missing Americans.
   Progress on that issue will depend on the outcome of that
meeting, which will be planned in the next few days, the official
said.
   Washington wants the ``fullest possible accounting'' of the
missing Americans, the official said.
   ``We would certainly want progress on Cambodia and POW-MIA to be
matched by progress in the (U.S.-Vietnam) relationship,'' he said.
   The private meeting with Baker followed a series of three
sessions this summer between Vietnam's U.N. ambassador and State
Department officials. Vietnam has been seeking to forge diplomatic
ties with the United States.
   A crowd of several hundred boisterous anti-Communist protesters
rallied outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where the meeting was
held. When Thach left the hotel and heard their chants, he ducked
into his waiting car and left without making any statement.
   Baker stayed inside to hold more meetings with other leaders.
   President Bush's administration has been expanding diplomatic
contacts with both Hanoi and the Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia. The United States had supported the rebel resistance, but
officials in Washington are now worried that a Communist rebel
faction that once ruled Cambodia will force its way back to power.
   Vietnam installed the Cambodian government when it invaded that
country in 1978 to oust the Communist faction, the Khmer Rouge.
   During its rule from 1975-79, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians directly through purges and executions and
indirectly through starvation and the hardship of a radical
agrarian relocation program.

   A man pulled the pin of a grenade and
handed it to his ex-girlfriend, then watched as she ran away from
nearby houses and held onto the safety lever until police arrived.
   No one was injured when Lisa Wood fled from the steps of her
home to an open area in her neighborhood - followed by her former
boyfriend in his car - then knelt down and waited for police Friday
afternoon, police said.
   Said Dave Durham, a neighbor who witnessed the incident:``I
yelled to her, `Lisa! Don't let go! Hold it baby, hold it! Just sit
down and wait till the police get here!' And she was squeezing it.
That little girl had a death hold on that grenade.''
   A 30-year-old man was being held at the city jail. He is
expected to be arraigned Monday on assault charges, Sgt. Beverly
Palumbo said. Police did not identify him pending the formal filing
of charges.
   ``She was afraid but she remained rational,'' Detective Tim
Hurtt said Saturday. ``Officers were able to put something in the
place of the pin.''
   Police said they confiscated a second grenade Friday night at
the suspect's home. A state police bomb squad was dissecting the
grenades this weekend to determine whether they were live, Palumbo
said.
   Wood and the suspect dated a few weeks ago, but she broke up
with him, said Wood's friend Frances Hall.
   Police arrived within minutes after the suspect handed Wood the
grenade on the steps of her home, authorities said.
   ``I thought he was going to hit her and she might have dropped
it,'' said Wood's mother, Evelyn Richey. ``I was scared ... my
daughter, standing there holding it. Then I ran in the house and
called the police.''

<HEAD>Engineering Grads Still in Demand; Journalists' Starting Pay Dips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nursing graduates and other health workers
just out of college enjoyed the biggest boost in salary offers,
while engineers gained slightly and starting pay for journalists
fell, a survey found.
   The ``Salary Survey,'' released Friday by College Placement
Council Inc., was based on offers extended to students graduating
between Sept. 1, 1989, and Aug. 31. The information was gathered
from 428 career service offices at U.S. colleges and universities.
   The cost of living rose 5.6 percent during the period, according
to the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index.
   A continued shortage of nursing graduates drove their starting
salary offers up 13.5 percent to an average of $28,270. Similarly,
a heavy demand for other health field graduates boosted their
average offer to $27,436, a 12.4 percent rise.
   Journalism was one of the few fields in which offers declined.
The average offer was $19,488, a 3 percent drop from the previous
year.
   Engineers fared better. Offers to petroleum engineers rose by
7.4 percent to an average of $35,202. Chemical engineers received
offers up 6.6 percent, to an average of $35,122. Aerospace
engineers received offers up 3.7 percent to an average of $30,509.
   Starting salary offers to mechanical, electrical and civil
engineers also rose, but not so much, the report said.
   Offers to computer science graduates rose 4 percent to an
average of $29,804.
   Cutbacks by financial institutions tightened the job market for
economics and finance graduates, who saw salary offers rise only
1.9 percent to an average of $25,184.
   Some graduates with master's degrees in business administration
did better than others.
   Offers to MBAs with non-technical undergraduate degrees and no
previous work experience went up 6.8 percent to an average $36,175,
but offers to MBAs with technical backgrounds rose only 1.7 percent
to an average of $37,737. Consulting firms made the most offers to
this group.
   The College Placement Council is a national professional
association aiding the career planning and employment process of
college graduates.

   A court ruling upholding an amnesty for
alleged human rights violators during the former military regime
will not prevent ``finding the truth and making justice'' about
abuses, a leader of the new civilian government said Saturday.
   Enrique Krauss, acting as government chief in the absence of
President Patricio Aylwin, who is in New York to attend U.N.
meetings, said the Supreme Court ruling causes a ``clash'' between
the executive and the court.
   The court ruled Friday 15-1 that the amnesty law covering 1973
to 1978 was constitutional, and ordered judges to halt any human
rights investigations or trials linked to incidents during the
five-year period.
   The amnesty law was issued in 1978 by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who
took power in a violent 1973 coup and ruled until lastMarch.
   After seizing power, the military launched severe repression on
supporters of the toppled leftist government. Thousands were
arrested, executed, tortured or forced into exile. The most serious
violations occurred during the period covered by the amnesty.
   Krauss, however, suggested the government may continue probes of
alleged abuses for the entire 16{-year Pinochet rule, even if the
courts do not. But he acknowledged the investigations covering the
1973-78 period would not lead to trials.
   ``This ruling can not prevent the government from pursuing its
goal of finding the truth and seeking justice,'' said Krauss.
   Krauss stressed the government ``respects the court ruling.''
   Aylwin, who succeeded Pinochet last March, named a nine-member
special pannel to investigate rights abuses and send the findings
to the courts for trial.
   Since May, the panel has documented about 3,200 killings linked
to the military, according to commission president Raul Rettig.
   The Supreme Court ruling was made following a legal challenge of
the amnesty law by Communist lawyer Alfonso Insunza, who claimed it
was unconstitutional.
   The ruling immediately affects at least 15 cases, including the
finding of mass graves containing the remains of 106 people
believed killed for political reasons.
   The situation poses a sensitive problem to the Aylwin
government, which faces pressure from the victims' relatives and
political groups, and the danger of an angry reaction from the
military.
   Pinochet remained commander of the powerful 60,000-man army
after handing the presidency to Aylwin. A clause in the 1980
constitution written by the Pinochet regime prevents his dismissal.
   Before leaving power, Pinochet repeatedly warned he would not
tolerate ``any of my men'' being brought to trial on human rights
charges.
   But some Pinochet supporters, including former Justice Minister
Monica Madariaga, one of the writers of the amnesty law, said they
would not oppose government inquiries into alleged abuses.

<HEAD>Gasoline, Heating Oil to be Rationed in Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline and heating oil will be rationed
in Bulgaria beginning next month because of the Iraqi embargo and
other fuel delivery cutbacks, according to a government decree
cited Saturday.
   Special coupons will be issued to ensure the gas rationing is
observed, Bulgarian media reported, quoting from the order.
   Long lines formed at gas stations this summer as Soviet oil
deliveries became erratic and the country lost crucial Iraqi
imports following U.N. economic sanctions in the aftermath of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Drivers of private taxis in the capital of Sofia staged short
``warning strikes'' Saturday after learning each vehicle would be
limited to 8{ gallons of gasoline a month beginning Oct. 15.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov, who traveled to Moscow last week,
reported that the Soviets would be able to deliver about two-thirds
of their previous oil shipments.
   The Dominican Republic has also begun gas rationing because of a
loss of Iraqi oil shipments.
   Bulgaria has offered to send about 400 soldiers to join the
multinational force in the Persian Gulf region, President Zhelyu
Zhelev said during a visit to Washington this week.
   The decision was welcomed by the newspaper of Zhelev's Union of
Democratic Forces, the main opposition party, but was questioned
Saturday by the governing Socialists.
   ``Since we are not officially invited by the United Nations, it
looks more like an interference in internal affairs. It would be a
great risk to start down this path,'' Socialist party spokesman
Dimitar Iontchev wrote in the party-affiliated Duma newspaper.
   Duma also quoted the head of the Movement for Rights and
Freedoms, which represents many of Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish
minority, as saying he opposed the dispatch of Bulgarian troops.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sitting in her study, with the dust from a
desert refugee camp covering her cowboy boots, Jordan's Queen Noor
worried that a decade of progress was slipping away because of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``To lose the momentum, after painstakingly building it for so
many years, would really be a tragedy,'' said the American-born
wife of King Hussein.
   ``All our people have been hit pretty hard. We have to help them
keep hope in the future. They mustn't lose heart during this
difficult time,'' she said. ``We're not going to let all our work
die.''
   By almost any measure, life for the nearly 3 million people of
Jordan has improved the past 10 years. Life expectancy is up;
infant mortality is down. More girls were going to school.
   Although unemployment remains high and income low, the country
met or surpassed International Monetary Fund targets and was set to
begin repaying its $8.3 billion debt.
   ``We'd finally reached a point where things were working. That,
of course, has been completely changed by the present
circumstances,'' said the former Elizabeth Halaby, a
Princeton-educated architect and planner who married the king in
1978.
   Tens of thousands of refugees from Iraq and Kuwait have overrun
the kingdom since the Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, and the nation's
small but valuable tourist industry collapsed.
   Meanwhile, King Hussein has been criticized for joining only a
handful of nations that did not fully denounce Iraq.
   The queen, who played a central role in the good times, is now a
key player in the bad. She has taken personal responsiblity for the
welfare of refugees, which reached about 100,000 at its peak.
   She's now in the United States, attending a conference on
children at the United Nations and presenting Jordan's position in
the crisis to groups in Washington, D.C., where she was born.
   Queen Noor, whose name in Arabic means ``light of Hussein,''
surprised many who expected her to wrap herself in luxury and
quietly raise a family after marrying the king.
   Jordanians didn't immediately warm to the idea of an American
queen, who has been chastized for reported extravagances and is
sometimes misunderstood.
   ``I wanted to come to the Arab world and contribute in any way I
could, knowing I'd come from a privileged environment where I'd had
the best of everything. I wanted to give something back,'' said the
39-year-old queen, who met King Hussein while working as a planner
for Royal Jordanian Airlines.
   ``So here I am in this fantastic, privileged position, able to
do what I want. I consider myself very lucky even in the worst of
times.''
   She has sponsored clinics and schools in crowded Palestinian
refugee camps and remote Bedouin villages. About the time her
fourth child was born five years ago, she set up the Noor
al-Hussein Foundation to coordinate her social and cultural work.
   The queen was also the catalyst for a cottage industry of
artisans that has caused a renaissance in Jordanian crafts.
   But a group of Jordanian businesswomen who met with the queen
recently complained their factories and stores were suffering from
the near-closing of Jordan's only port at Aqaba and the U.N. trade
sanctions against Iraq.
   ``We don't know how much longer this is going to go on,'' said a
matchstick manufacturer. ``We can't plan ahead. We can't ship our
stock by sea and we can't sell to our biggest customer.''
   With the tourist industry now moribund, The Jordan Design and
Trade Center has a new importance as it seeks to develop export
markets.
   About 1,000 women sell their richly textured rugs, colorful
embroidered pillows and dresses and other goods through the center,
which just received a $100,000 U.N. grant to teach management
skills to the women.
   In a room across from the meeting of Jordanian businesswomen, a
dozen Palestinian women, their heads covered in Moslem style,
listened to a lecture on quality control.
   When the queen entered, nobody got up and the women showed more
curiosity than warmth.
   ``She's accepted but not loved,'' said a Jordanian journalist
familiar with the royal family. ``No matter what she does, she'll
never be an Arab and will never have the affection of the people
that an Arab woman would receive without doing anything.''

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Orders Attack on Rival Accused of Violating Truce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Prince Johnson said
Saturday that his fighters have begun attacking forces of rival
guerrilla chief Charles Taylor, who he accused of violating a
weeklong cease-fire.
   Johnson also said he planned to capture, court-martial and
execute soldiers of slain President Samuel Doe found guilty of war
crimes.
   People who ``committed a lot of atrocities and slaughtered so
many innocent civilians cannot be given any clemency,'' he said.
   A precarious truce between four armies in Monrovia - declared by
Taylor on Sept. 22 - was endangered by heavy artillery fire Friday
and increased shooting Friday night and Saturday in the city
center.
   Johnson said Taylor's men twice in two days had attacked his
forces, and that he ordered his men to fight back Saturday.
   Taylor's army has overrun most of Liberia, but he has been
unable to capture the capital city and presidential mansion that is
the seat of government.
   Trapped in the heavily fortified mansion are remnants of Doe's
army, who Johnson threatened to attack.
   The remarks from Johnson, who controls most of downtown
Monrovia, appeared aimed at provoking an attack on Taylor by the
fourth army, a five-nation West African army sent to enforce a
truce.
   ``ECOMOG (the West African force) is delaying peace in this
country,'' Johnson told reporters. ``The problem now is with
ECOMOG, which is supposed to deploy its troops in the war zones now
that there is a cease-fire and clear those who violate the
cease-fire.''
   All three Liberian armies have slaughtered more than 5,000
civilians since Taylor invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to oust
Doe. The war fast became a tribal conflict. Most victims lost their
lives because of ethnic affiliations.
   Since Doe's death, battle lines had been drawn with the
4,500-strong West African army, Johnson and Doe officers backing
West African plans to install an interim government, and Taylor
trying to impose a government of which he has declared himself
president.
   Johnson said Saturday: ``When the interim government comes, I
will hand over to them and go back to the barracks to play my role
as a soldier.''
   Taylor accuses the West Africans of plotting to install a puppet
administration. Both sides say their governments would organize
fair elections. The West African-sponsored government, named by
Liberian opposition parties, businessmen and clergymen, excludes
the warring parties to help ensure fair balloting.
   Meanwhile, Monrovians are dying of starvation and disease.
   Thousands of hungry people gathered Saturday around the
capital's port, where the West African force was unloading the
first major relief food to arrive since July aboard a Nigerian
commercial vessel. It includes 150 tons of rice and 10 tons of
canned food and cooking oil.

   Seventy-six paintings seized from Imelda and
Ferdinand Marcos are not worth the multimillion-dollar price tag
placed on them for auction, an arts magazine says.
   Experts quoted in the October issue of ARTNews said the
paintings are not worth the $8.6 million to $12.5 million Christies
auction house estimated they will bring at a sale in January.
   Conservator Marco Grassi told the magazine that galleries sold
Mrs. Marcos ``inferior art at superior prices.''
   Ian Kennedy, vice president of Christies' Old Master paintings
department, stood by the estimates.
   ``Of course anybody can disagree with estimates, but I am
perfectly satisfied,'' he said. ``You can tell it's not garbage.''
   The paintings were seized by the Philippines government after
Marcos was deposed and the couple fled to Hawaii in 1986. Marcos
died last year.
   Among the paintings is a Madonna and child for which Mrs. Marcos
paid $700,000. She was reportedly told that it was by the
Renaissance master Fra Filippo Lippi, but ARTNews said it was
really done by a lesser-known artist. Christies' estimate for the
painting was $40,000 to $60,000.
   ARTNews said the most valuable artworks Mrs. Marcos owned are
missing, including paintings by Monet, Renoir, Degas, Gauguin,
Cezanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Chagall and Magritte.

   Jurors in the trial of an art gallery accused
of violating obscenity laws by displaying sexually explicit
photographs were given plenty to think about even before they were
empaneled last week.
   ``If you were shown a picture of a homosexual act, would you be
offended?'' Marc Mezibov, an attorney for the Contemporary Arts
Center, asked prospective jurors. ``Does it make him (Mapplethorpe)
any less of an artist because he was a homosexual?''
   The gallery and its director, Dennis Barrie, are charged with
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
The charges were based on seven photographs that were part of the
175-picture exhibit ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
appearance. It closed May 26 and is on display in Boston. A grand
jury viewed the exhibit April 7 before returning the indictments.
   Defense lawyers say the controversial work has artistic and
political merit, but the prosecution says the photos violate
obscenity laws.
   ``You understand that the arts community is not on trial here,''
Assistant City Prosecutor Frank Prouty asked a prospective juror.
``The issue is whether or not ... these pictures are obscene.''
   Attorney H. Louis Sirkin, representing Barrie, tried to steer
jurors in another direction.
   ``Can you accept that photography is an art form?'' Sirkin
asked. He spent some time talking about the intent and feeling that
goes into a floral display.
   In his opening statement Friday, Sirkin said that ``art is not
always to be pleasing to our eyes.''
   ``Art is to tell us something about ourselves, to make us look
inside ourselves and to look at the world around us,'' he said.
``By doing that, it (the Mapplethorpe exhibit) does without
question have serious value both artistically and politically.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court has said the test of obscenity is whether
the dominant theme of the artwork appeals to a prurient interest in
sex, whether the work is patently offensive based on contemporary
community standards and whether the work lacks serious artistic or
political value.
   Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March 1989 at age 42.
   The photographs show a man urinating into another's mouth and
pictures of objects, including a whip, inserted into men's anuses.
The child nudity charge is based on two pictures of children, one
of a boy and one of a girl, with genitals showing.
   Prouty repeatedly told jurors that the photos, by their mere
presence, could secure a conviction.
   ``Obscenity is obscenity,'' he said.
   ``You may have to look at the picture, but what's really on
trial is Mr. Barrie,'' Sirkin told jurors. ``Robert Mapplethorpe is
not on trial, and his lifestyle is not on trial.''
   In attempting to assess community awareness, defense attorneys
asked prospective jurors how often they visited galleries, heard
concerts and saw movies.
   One man said he didn't go to many movies because ``I don't want
to put out the $3.75.''
   ``It has been a long time since you've been to a movie,'' Sirkin
responded.
   On Friday, two police officers testified they saw the photos on
display at the gallery. Testimony is scheduled to resume Monday in
Hamilton County Municipal Court.

   The world's highest AIDS rates are in Africa, a
continent where health officials are ill-equipped to cope with the
disease, experts at an AIDS symposium said Saturday.
   ``AIDS comes on top of Africa's already intolerable burden of
economic, social and health problems,'' said Dr. Nzilambi Nzila,
deputy director of a Kinshasa, Zaire, AIDS project.
   ``The countries which have been most affected are the countries
least able to handle this problem,'' said Dr. P.K. Kataaha,
presenting a report from Ugandan health officials.
   Some 65,000 AIDS cases have been officially reported in Africa,
but the World Health Organization estimates the true total is
probably closer to 500,000. In some countries, such as Uganda,
health officials estimate that one person in every five is already
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
   In contrast, about 150,000 cases have been recorded in the
United States, and about one in 200 persons is infected with the
virus.
   Kataaha and other researchers spoke at a symposium sponsored by
the Morehouse School of Medicine and the federal government's
Research Centers in Minority Institutions program. Saturday was the
final day of the symposium.
   The African AIDS epidemic has effects beyond the immediate toll
of death and sickness, said Dr. Alfred J. Fortin, a specialist in
AIDS and development issues from the University of Hawaii.
   AIDS in Africa ``is just one more reason for those with capital
to look elsewhere when they're investing, traveling, or
contemplating starting new industries,'' Fortin said.
   And Africa, a continent with substandard health care to begin
with, faces ``major political problems'' trying to address AIDS
concerns, he said.
   African nations, like many Third World countries, ``tend to
place all their eggs in the international-assistance basket,'' he
said. And ``there is no active AIDS constituency there, as there is
in this country.''
   The disease is sweeping through middle- and upper-income people
in Africa, robbing countries of laborers, technicians and
government workers they badly need, Fortin said.
   ``This is having a significant effect on the productive powers
of those societies,'' he said.

   The Supreme Court agreed Saturday to
hear an appeal to halt a plan that reserves nearly half the civil
service posts for low-caste Hindus. The policy has led to a rash of
protest clashes and suicides.
   A panel of five justices are expected to meet Monday on an
application by the Supreme Court Bar Association for a temporary
injunction on the program, announced Aug. 7 by Prime Minister V.P.
Singh to counteract centuries of discrimination.
   The appeal seeks to suspend the quota program until a Nov. 6
hearing on its legality.
   Meanwhile, some members of Singh's Janata Dal party in
Parliament issued a letter accusing him of mishandling the issue
and demanding his resignation.
   Leaders of the critics refused to say how many people signed the
letter, but most had previously been aligned with Singh's party
rivals, Indian news agencies reported.
   Four upper-caste students committed suicide to protest the
policy and one person died from gunshot wounds Friday when police
tried to quell riots in Hansi, about 50 miles northwest of New
Delhi.
   Thirteen youths have taken their lives the past 10 days, some
burning themselves or taking poison. Each left a note blaming the
job policy. Also, 48 people have died by police gunfire in street
battles.
   White-collar government jobs are highly coveted by graduates in
India, where more than 5 million educated people are unemployed,
according to official figures. The government employs about 18
million people.
   K.K. Venugopal, president of the bar association, said he hoped
an injunction would stop the wave of suicides. A three-member
Supreme Court tribunal had earlier declined to intervene in the
case.
   Singh has refused to retract or delay the policy to increase the
low-caste job quota to 49 percent, saying it is necessary to
reverse centuries of discrimination. Previously, 22 percent of jobs
were reserved for the lower castes.
   India's complex Hindu caste system sets social levels according
to birth, ranging from the top-level Brahmins to the Sudras, who do
menial tasks. Below them are the ``untouchables.'' Tradition
forbids them from wearing shoes, riding bicycles or sharing a water
well with caste Hindus.
   Upper-caste students claim reverse discrimination will deprived
them of jobs even though they are better qualified. Some
psychologists quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency said
the dozens of suicide bids suggest mass hysteria.
   Hoping to ease student anger, the government announced a plan to
create 3 million new jobs in five years in the nation of 880
million people.
   The unrest has also threatened the stability of Singh's minority
National Front coalition.
   Singh's allies have attacked his handling of the demonstrations,
though none has criticized the idea of reserving jobs for deprived
classes.
   Senior leaders of Singh's party decided at a closed meeting
Friday to leave the government's decision intact, news reports
said.
   A test of Singh's 10-month-old coalition government may come
early next month when Parliament convenes in special session to
discuss extending federal rule over the state of Punjab, where Sikh
militants are fighting to leave the Indian union.
   India, which is 82 percent Hindu, embraced secularism and
socialist ideals when it became independent from Britain in 1947.
It pledged to discard the caste system, but the ancient social
order continues.

<HEAD>Report: Officials Suspect German Ship Carries Chemicals for Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are trying to stop a
ship carrying chemicals they suspect are headed for Iraq, a major
West German magazine said Saturday.
   The Hamburg-based Spiegel magazine said the German ship was
docked in Turkey loaded with 90 tons of sodium cyanide, which can
be used to produce prussic acid and other poison gases.
   The shipload of chemicals was registered to be delivered to Iran
and destined for use in that country's mining industry, the report
said. But it said Turkish authorities believe the chemicals'
intended destination is Iraq.
   According to Spiegel, West German authorities have been notified
about the matter, and officials are working to prevent delivery of
the shipment.
   In related reports, Spiegel also said a Bonn businessman was
suspected of illegal exports to Iraq, and that a Foreign Ministry
employee had been arrested as an alleged Iraqi agent.
   It said a 50-year-old manager of a Bonn-based export-import
company was under investigation for allegedly providing Iraq
technology needed to construct atomic weapons, and material to
improve Soviet-made rockets.
   The report said the manager was also suspected of helping to
provide material to produce poison gas.
   Spiegel identified the company as Import-Export Firma Inwako
GmbH, but did not identify the manager by name. It said he had been
arrested and released on bail pending further investigation.
   The newsweekly also said that officials have arrested a West
German Foreign Ministry employee who worked in Egypt for allegedly
providing secrets to Iraq and other Middle East countries.
   The report identifed the employee as Mohammed Juergen Gietler,
who it said had worked for the ministry in Alexandria.
   Spiegel said that Gietler had been given the name Mohammed when
he converted to Islam in 1987.
   Excerpts from the reports, which will appear in Spiegel's Monday
editions, were provided in advance to other news media.

   A senior Iraqi official denied that foreigners would be deprived
of food supplies when a rationing system begins this week. Iraqi
officials had threatened last week to withhold food from non-Arab
foreigners starting Monday.
   But on Saturday, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, minister of trade and
finance, told the Iraqi News Agency that rationing would provide
basic foodstuffs in equal share for ``for Iraqis, Arabs, diplomatic
missions, foreigners working in Iraq and all those who arrived as
guests of Iraq without any preferential treatment for any group,''

   The first desert-hardened units of the French Foreign Legion
arrived Saturday in Saudi Arabia, joining the largest deployment of
French forces overseas since Algeria's war of independence, which
lasted from 1954-62. The bulk of French ground forces - 4,000
troops - are expected to arrive Sunday.
   France will have about 13,000 troops in and around Saudi Arabia
when the current deployment is completed.

   France warned it would retaliate if it turns out Iraq was behind
a grenade attack that killed a French child and injured 17 other
people Thursday night in Djibouti. The small Red Sea country
provides support bases for French forces deployed in the gulf
region.

   A monthlong British deployment of up to 9,000 ground forces is
under way, British officials said. The logistical landing ship Sir
Tristram sailed Friday night from southern England, and several
hundred troops left by air from bases in southern England and
Germany. Initial estimates put the troop size in Britain's 7th
Armored Brigade and support units being sent to the gulf at 6,000
to 8,000. But The Times of London said Saturday the number could
reach 9,000. ---
   More than 70 world leaders, including President Bush, were
arriving in New York for the two-day World Summit for Children,
opening Saturday at the United Nations. Bush was to speak Monday to
the U.N. General Assembly, where a parade of world leaders last
week condemned the Iraqi invasion.

   A report said the Bush administration had refused Taiwan's offer
of about $100 million to help pay for the military buildup in the
gulf. The Los Angeles Times said in Saturday's editions the U.S.
move was prompted by the wish to remain on good terms with China,
which has one of five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council.
The United States has depended on China to support Security Council
sanctions against Iraq.

<HEAD>Soviet Premier Warns of Economic Disorder, Hungry Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov warned Saturday of
economic disorder spreading through the country and said the potato
crop must be harvested within three weeks to avoid a hungry winter
for the masses.
   Ryzhkov, in a nationally televised interview, depicted a
crumbling economy, with promised shipments of food, medicine and
other necessities going undelivered, and ``economic warfare'' being
waged among cities and regions.
   ``I don't want to dramatize things. I don't want to frighten
anyone. I have no right to do that,'' Ryzhkov said.
   ``But laws are not obeyed, decrees are not obeyed, resolutions
are not obeyed. There are massive violations, to say nothing of
criminal violations,'' he said. ``It's been a long time since we
had such a situation in this country.''
   Ryzhkov has been pushing for a more moderate economic reform
than that endorsed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
has backed a plan to move from central planning to a market system
in this nation of 290 million residents.
   The Soviet parliament has been unable to enact a coherent reform
plan, and last week bestowed extraordinary powers on Gorbachev to
direct the economic transition. Gorbachev's first step was a decree
threatening fines against suppliers who do not make promised
deliveries.
   That decree, and Rykhkov's televised warning, came amid media
reports that the harvest was going poorly, especially for potatoes,
a staple of the Soviet diet.
   This week, factory workers, soldiers and city dwellers swarmed
to the countryside to help farmers pull potatoes from rain-soaked
fields in an effort to fend off hunger this winter.
   ``In some industrial regions, people are going to the fields
despite the difficult weather conditions, and the Army helps,''
Ryzhkov said.
   He referred to a resolution by the Council of Ministers on
Wednesday aimed at ``saving the harvest, especially vegetables and
potatoes. ... The situation is very difficult.''
   Asked to evaluate prospects for an adequate food supply this
winter, Ryzhkov replied: ``I think now these weeks, two or maximum
three, if we work as we should, we have reasons to say that we will
be able to store up potatoes, even though the crops are worse this
year.''
   He mostly blamed the weather, which has been cold and rainy in
central Russia since mid-August.
   But he also laid the onus on the collapse of the system of
economic planning, in which the central government orders factories
and farms what goods to deliver, when and where.
   As the country prepares to shift to a market economy, and
producers cast about for higher profits, those centrally planned
deliveries are not being made.
   ``What causes great concern, and even indignation, is the
discipline of deliveries. Take meat, for example. The meat
situation has sharply worsened,'' said Ryzhkov.
   He cited the failure of collective farms to deliver meat to
Sverdlovsk, a key industrial city in the Ural Mountains east of
Moscow, and a decision by authorities in Karelia near Finland to
make scheduled timber deliveries outside that region because
Karelians were not receiving food from elsewhere.
   ``We cannot allow ourselves into a situation where regions wage
economic war against each other,'' he said.
   ``It's like a chain reaction. Ultimately, it's bad for
everyone,'' he said. ``It's a single economic organism, and it
ought to work precisely and be well-coordinated ... People
themselves will suffer. The question of discipline is coming to the
fore today.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, in a message to the World
Summit for Children, urged families Saturday to respect ``all human
life, unborn as well as born.''
   The pontiff also said the Vatican supports an international
treaty on children's rights as long as programs do not advocate use
of birth control, opposed by the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``The children of the world cry out for greater respect for
their inalienable individual dignity and for their right to life
from the first moment of conception, even in the face of difficult
circumstances or personal handicap,'' the pope said in a message to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De Cuellar.
   Reiterating the church's opposition to abortion, John Paul said
children should be raised in families ``where there is profound
respect for all human life, unborn as well as born, and where both
mother and father jointly make responsbile decisions regarding the
exercise of their parenthood.''
   A text of the pope's message was released by the Vatican.
   The two-day summit at the United Nations is aimed at mobilizing
governments to protect up to 100 million children from death by
disease and malnutrition in the 1990s.
   The pope praised the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
which went into effect this month and requires ratifying nations to
guarantee the survival of children and their development.
   In a reference to birth control, John Paul stressed the Vatican
endorsed the convention on the understanding that future programs
and actions will respect ``the moral convictions of parents
regarding the transmission of life, with no urging to resort to
means which are morally unacceptable.''

<HEAD>Ivorian Cardinal Says Ghana Group Plotted to Kill Pope</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Bernard Yago said Saturday
a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II was uncovered prior to a
papal visit earlier this month, but denied Ivory Coast opposition
parties were involved.
   The cardinal attributed the plot to a group based in Ghana, and
condemned President Felix Houphouet-Boigny for disclosing details
about the plot.
   ``He should have kept it secret. ... He has held political
interests above those of the (Roman Catholic) Church,'' the
cardinal said in rare criticism of Ivory Coast's leader of 30
years.
   The cardinal noted Houphouet-Boigny accusation's came as the
president faced the nation's first multiparty elections on Oct. 28.
   The 85-year-old president did not name those he claimed were
responsible for hiring mercenaries and former soldiers to kill John
Paul when he visited Ivory Coast on Sept. 9-10. No attack was made
on the pontiff.
   Yago said one assassination plotter had confessed to a parish
priest, and said he was ``disgusted'' by Houphouet-Boigny's
``political use'' of knowledge that came from the confessional.
   Emile Boga, a leader of the opposition Ivorian Popular Front,
called the assassination plot allegations ``a fabrication.''
   The cardinal said the pontiff had been told about the plot
before the visit.
   Earlier, chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro, asked about
Houphouet-Boigny's claim, said, ``We never comment on such
matters.''

   In a major step toward normalizing relations,
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has given the green light for
direct flights between the Soviet Union and Israel, a senior
Israeli official said Saturday.
   The flights will begin within a month, said Yossi Ahimeir, a
spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. He said the Soviets
did not provide further details about the arrangement, which by
late Saturday had not been reported by Soviet media.
   The flights would accelerate the exodus of Jews from the Soviet
Union to Israel. The Jewish state is already straining to
accommodate more than 100,000 newcomers who have arrived since last
year.
   A senior Israeli immigration official, however, said the number
of direct flights would initially be limited to about two per week
each way, and thus would not immediately have a dramatic effect on
the numbers of Soviet immigrants.
   ``But hopefully the number of flights will eventually be
expanded,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``We would like to be in a position in which the majority of Soviet
Jews can come straight from the Soviet Union. It's easier and
safer.''
   The immigrants now arrive via European transit points, and space
is often limited. Even before the direct flights agreement was
announced, estimates said the number of Soviet Jewish immigrants
could swell to 1 million by the end of 1992.
   Ahimeir praised the Soviet step as ``a very positive development
in the direction of strengthening and intensifying the relations
between Israel and the Soviet Union.''
   He said it was another leap toward resuming diplomatic ties.
``The Soviets themselves have told us that after such a period of
improved relations, it is very possible that there will be
diplomatic relations,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The Soviet Union cut ties with Israel after it captured
territory of Moscow's Arab allies in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Relations have warmed the past three years, in part because
Israel is seen by the Soviets as a conduit for Western investment
and because Moscow wants to play a role in Middle Eastern
diplomacy.
   The Soviet decision to allow direct flights was passed on by
Soviet Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov to Israeli Transportation
Minister Moshe Katzav in a telephone call on Friday, the eve of Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, Israel radio reported.
   The national airlines of the two countries, Aeroflot and El Al,
signed a direct flights agreement last year, but Aeroflot then said
it needed approval from Soviet leaders before flights could being.
   Gorbachev held up the deal because he didn't want to anger Arab
states protesting the immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. Arab
fears heightened after Shamir suggested in January that Israel
needs to hold on to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to house
the newcomers.
   In April, Israelis rejected a Soviet offer of direct flights in
exchange for a promise not to settle Soviet Jews in the occupied
lands. Israel maintains it cannot tell immigrants where to live.
   ``It seems they (the Soviets) are now softening their
position,'' Ahimeir said.
   The apparent Soviet concession comes at a time when the Arab
world is busy with the Persian Gulf crisis.

<HEAD>State Department Renews Warning of Possible Iraqi-Inspired
Terrorism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Saturday issued a new
warning to Americans traveling abroad of the threat of
Iraq-sponsored terrorist attacks ``in the near future.''
   ``The State Department is particularly concerned about possible
terrorist attacks in Europe and the Middle East,'' the advisory
said.
   Like an initial warning issued Sept. 7, the new announcement did
not cite specific locations that may be targeted by terrorist
forces loyal to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
   However, it said, ``Evidence continues to accumulate that
Iraqi-sponsored terrorism may occur in the near future.''
   The department said for the first time that its evidence points
to Europe and the Middle East as the likeliest areas for terrorist
attack.
   ``While information does not suggest that Americans traveling
abroad are the specific targets of possible Iraqi-sponsored
terrorism,'' the advisory said, ``Americans overseas should
exercise caution, particularly when in or near U.S. milttary or
civilian facilities or at other facilities commonly identified as
`American.'''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters in a
briefing Friday that Saddam was ``actively discussing things'' with
terrorist leaders.
   Asked if there was evidence of specific threats, Scowcroft said,
``There have been a couple of strange incidents in Brussels, for
example, and there was a recent one, there was a soldier shot, I
think, and wounded in Saudi Arabia.''
   Last week, assailants broke into the Brussels home of a U.S. Air
Force general assigned to NATO, and Belgian reports called the
incident an attempted kidnapping or murder. The general was out of
the country at the time.
   And an Air Force mechanic suffered a gunshot wound to the
shoulder Thursday at a facility in Saudi Arabia. The Air Force said
it was unable to determine whether the shooting was a terrorist
act.
   ``What we do have are some indications that Saddam Hussein is
actively discussing things with leaders of certain terrorist
organizations, and it was for that reason that we gave him an
explicit warning that we would consider terrorist activities as
coming from him and hold him personally responsible,'' Scowcroft
said.
   France warned Saturday it would retaliate if it finds Iraq was
even indirectly behind a grenade attack that killed a French child
and injured 17 other people Thursday night in Djibouti.
   On Thursday, assailants hurled grenades into a crowded cafe
popular with French soldiers stationed in the Red Sea nation.
   The State Department's original advisory was released about a
month after the United States began the massive deployment of
forces to the Persian Gulf region in response to Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.

   Russian President Boris Yeltsin was injured more
seriously than previously thought in a car accident, and he is
recovering at home, a Soviet newspaper said Saturday.
   The reform leader's car was broadsided in rush hour traffic on
Sept. 21, but he went on to work at the Russian republic's offices
in Moscow later that day. News reports said he suffered only minor
hip injuries.
   The Soviet newspaper Trud reported Saturday that Yeltsin had
suffered ``massive injuries of the body, especially the thigh,''
that it said were ``slowly healing.'' The newspaper did not specify
what kind of injuries.
   Doctors have not prescribed any special medicines, the report
said, but recommended Yeltson rest for 10 days.
   ``However, Boris Nikolaiyevich is optimistic and is carefully
watching all developments, and his family is taking care of him,''
Trud said.

   United Auto Workers union members appeared to be
giving overwhelming approval to a new three-year contract with
General Motors Corp. as voting wound down Saturday.
   Voting on the new pact concludes Sunday. Union officials said
they will not release final totals until later this week, but
checks at more than half of the 155 union locals at GM facilities
revealed large ratification margins.
   ``I felt that it was well-received,'' UAW Local 696 President
Joseph Hasenjager said Saturday, the day after 83 percent of voting
members in his 3,200-member local at Dayton, Ohio, approved the
contract.
   Other locals approving the contract late last week included
Local 1618 at the Reatta Craft Centre in Lansing, Mich., with 94
percent in favor; Local 662 in Anderson, Ind., with 90 percent
support; and Local 653 in Pontiac, Mich., with 88 percent favoring
the pact.
   Meanwhile, in Toronto, Canadian Auto Workers union spokeswoman
Peggy Nash said her union's talks with General Motors of Canada
Ltd. continued this weekend on local issues.
   She said the first meeting of top negotiating committees from
both sides is scheduled for later this week. The union, which is
basing its demands on a contract it reached with Ford of Canada
earlier this month, has set an Oct. 10 deadline for talks with GM's
Canadian subsidiary.
   In the United States, the UAW hopes to pattern agreements with
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. with the contract it reached with
GM on Sept. 17. After the ballots on the UAW-GM contract are
counted, the union will begin intensive bargaining with either Ford
or Chrysler Corp.
   UAW contracts with each of the Big Three expired at midnight
Sept. 14.
   Provisions of agreements covering more than 450,000 active
workers were continued while bargaining and ratification voting
went on. GM employs about 300,000 of the union's members, Ford has
about 106,000 and Chrysler has about 60,000.
   It's expected that Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker
behind GM, will have little problem coming to terms with the UAW
over a contract similar to GM's.
   There's a much more ominous tone to the UAW-Chrysler talks.
   The union repeatedly has said it will not settle for a contract
with Chrysler outside of the pattern set with the other automakers.
And Chrysler has said just as often it needs to cut its labor
costs, especially in health care.
   The GM-UAW contract provides for no change in the health-care
system offered to employees.
   Maintenance of health care provisions negotiated in 1987 and
improvements in the pension plan were two of the big sellers of the
1990 contract, Hasenjager said.
   Other selling points included a GM promise to pay up to $4
billion to guarantee wages for workers laid off mre than 36 weeks
during the next three years.
   In addition, the contract provides for a 3 percent raise in the
first year and lump sum payments in the second and third years of 3
percent. Cost of living adjustments were retained.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new violence. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 Palestinians spilled gasoline onto
roads near Jerusalem's Old City on Saturday and battled riot
police, who wounded three youths by firing rubber bullets,
according to police and Arab witnesses.
   The clashes broke out just before sundown, which marked the end
of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and holiest day on the
Jewish calendar.
   Earlier Saturday, high school principal Mohammed Mustafa Abu
Hassanein, 50, was killed by masked Palestinian gunmen in his
office in Gaza City. He reportedly had been accused him of
collaborating with Israel.
   The reports said the attackers entered Saladin Preparatory
School and shot Abu Hassanein in the head at close range.
   Palestinian youths blocked roads in the Arab Silwan neighborhood
just south of the walled Old City and then marched toward the Old
City's Dung Gate, police spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   Near the gate, they spilled gasoline on the road and built
roadblocks with stones, Arab witnesses said. They gasoline
apparently was aimed at blocking the access of police.
   Sandori said riot police fired rubber bullets, wounding three
youths. Four others were arrested.
   Clashes were also reported inside the Old City, and police said
three Palestinians were arrested.
   Abu Hassanein was the 269th Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs
in the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Most were accused of collaboration
or of dealing in drugs or prostitution.
   At least 730 other Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians, and 48 Israelis have died in the violence.
   The army blocked Palestinians from entering Israel from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip on the holy day.
   Bureij refugee camp, where a soldier was killed Sept. 20,
remained under curfew, Arab reports said. Curfews also were in
force in a half-dozen other Gaza camps and towns.

<TEXT>
   A barge spilled nearly 30,000 gallons of
a partly refined crude oil solvent after colliding with another
ship. Officials said the spill was evaporating quickly Saturday.
   ``There's very little to clean up,'' U.S. Coast Guard Capt.
Thomas Greene said. ``We're letting nature and the effects of the
sun and temperature take its course.''
   The Norwegian tanker Bow Panther, lost power Friday night and
collided with the barges being pulled by a tugboat toward the Port
of Houston, he said. There were no reported injuries.
   A cargo tank on the 297-foot barge cracked, spilling the solvent
reformate, a partly refined crude oil that resembles gasoline.
   Texas Department of Health officials were investigating the
effects of the spill on shellfish, but since the solvent will not
dissolve in water or sink it was deemed too early to issue
warnings.
   In July, about 700,000 gallons of oil spilled into the
environmentally sensitive Galveston Bay when the Greek tanker
Shinoussa collided with two barges in the ship channel.

<HEAD>Polish Senate Endorses Law Outlawing Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Saturday approved a proposal
that would outlaw most abortions in Poland for the first time in 34
years, while setting jail terms for doctors who perform them.
   The bill passed 50-17 with five abstentions. It must next be
considered by the Sejm, Parliament's lower chamber.
   The bill would allow abortions only when a woman's life is in
danger or when pregnancy is a result of a crime. The senators
rejected a provision to establish jail terms for woman who have
abortions.
   Feminist groups from around the country protested vociferously
during the two-day Senate debate. Abortion has been legal since
1956, when Communist authorities made the decision without public
debate.
   Poland is about 90 percent Roman Catholic but it has one of the
world's highest abortion rates.
   More than 500 people, mostly young women, marched outside the
Parliament building Saturday carrying banners and throwing leaflets
criticizing the legislation.
   ``Don't let a small group of men decide about the life of
women,'' one female demonstrator called over a loudspeaker. The
100-member Senate has seven women.
   Sen. Edward Wende, who spoke with a five-member delegation of
protesters, said the proposal was still far from becoming law.
   ``This is only the beginning of the legislative process. We all
agree in principle that the mother should not be punished,'' said
Wende. ``This is Parliament and further discussion will be held
here about the final shape of this law.''
   In May 1989, the Sejm proposed a more punitive bill that would
have penalized both doctors and the women who undergo abortions.
Action on the bill was delayed, but the Senate decision throws the
matter back into the Sejm.
   As Poland and other East Bloc nations move toward democracy,
issues such as abortion and religious education in schools have
emerged.
   In some areas of Czechoslovakia, groups have pushed to restrict
relatively easy access to abortion. Roman Catholic church leaders
in Hungary also are campaigning to restrict abortions.
   In Romania, on the other hand, nearly 500,000 women have had
abortions since a ban by the late President Nicolae Ceausescu was
lifted when he was deposed in December.
   Although the vast majority of Poles consider themselves Roman
Catholic, many young couples turn to abortion when they are unable
to find larger apartments in the housing-starved nation. Reliable
contraceptives are infrequently available in Poland.

   The chief of U.S. military
logistics in Saudi Arabia said Saturday the supply flow was on
schedule and could sustain American forces for more than a month of
all-out war with Iraq.
   Maj. Gen. William G. Pagonis said present American resources
could last up to two to three months. He called his supply problems
``peanuts'' compared to those facing President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq.
   ``My goals and objectives are to be able to sustain ourselves
for as long as necessary in a defensive posture, or to do anything
else that . . . (President Bush) and the king of Saudi Arabia
decide for us to do,'' Pagonis said in an interview.
   He said this meant building up reserve stocks for 30 days.
   Delivery of ammunition and other fresh supplies would be a top
priority even in a brief conflict between Iraq and the United
States and its allies.
   Pagonis, the commander of the U.S. Army Support Command, arrived
here Aug. 3, a day after Iraq seized Kuwait. He said he had to use
a rented Chevrolet as his office at first and slept one night in
the back seat.
   U.S. forces have the supply edge over Baghdad despite having to
import huge amounts of material from the United States, Pagonis
said.
   Iraq would have ``an enormous problem'' in maintaining its
supply lines over ``limited road access with a limited number of
trucks, that can only carry so much cargo.
   ``My line of communication is from the port to the soldiers . .
. That's peanuts compared to his.''
   Iraq's supply problems are sure to grow worse as a result of
U.N. economic sanctions, he said.
   Pagonis said the first sea delivery of supplies was completed
within 30 days and that eight fast sealift ships that brought the
first loads of armor and other major equipment now are on the way
with more.
   ``We've delivered more soldiers and discharged more ships in a
short period of time than any armed forces in the world,'' the
general said.
   Pagonis said logistical troops now arriving would be able to
take up the slack should an outbreak of hostilities send the
thousands of drivers and other civilian contract workers now
employed by the Americans fleeing for safety.
   Many of the workers are third country foreigners who have no
families in Saudi Arabia and would probably remain with the U.S.
troops in the event of war, he said.
   The general estimated overall costs of U.S.-contracted services
at $380 million a month.
   The Saudis are providing free water, fuel and most of the food
for U.S. troops other than field rations, he said.

   Lebanese President Elias Hrawi held five
hours of talks Saturday with President Hafez Assad and received
Syria's support for the measures he is taking against a rebel
Christian leader, officials said.
   Hrawi's army closed all crossing points into east Beirut enclave
of Gen. Michel Aoun on Friday in a bid to starve him into
submission.
   It was not clear whether Hrawi had asked for military support,
although it is generally understood that Syria is willing to
provide military assistance if Hrawi asked.
   ``President Assad expressed Syria's full support to the moves
taken by the Lebanese legitimacy to extend its authority, and
expressed Syria's readiness to provide every assistance to achieve
this purpose,'' presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said.
   Hrawi's move Friday tightened an economic blockade that his
government imposed July 30 against Aoun and his 15,000 soldiers,
who control an area of 80 square miles in east Beirut and the
neighboring Metn Mountains.
   Troops stopped all supplies of flour, food and vegetables from
entering the zone Friday. Fuel supplies and money transfers had
been banned for two months.
   Hrawi and Aoun are both Maronite Catholics, the sect that has
dominated government structures in Lebanon since independence from
France in 1943.
   Hrawi was elected last fall within the framework of a peace plan
brokered by the Arab League to resolve Lebanon's 15-year-old civil
war between Moslems and Christians.
   Aoun rejected the plan because it did not include a timetable
for the withdrawal of Syrian troops, in Lebanon since 1976.

   Lockheed Corp.'s prototype
of a 21st century fighter jet made its first flight Saturday in a
winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar Advanced
Tactical Fighter contract.
   The YF-22 was airborne just 18 minutes, taking off from Air
Force Plant 42 in Palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desert
flight test center.
   The flight was a milestone in a high-stakes contest between an
aerospace team headed by Lockheed and a team led by Northrop Corp.
for 1,250 ATF jets, to be built at a projected cost of $51 million
per plane.
   The winner must produce a jet that is highly maneuverable, uses
radar-evading stealth technology and can fly twice the speed of
sound for long periods of time. The Air Force wants 750 of the new
planes and the Navy needs 500.
   Pilot Dave Ferguson said the YF-22 flew as expected although the
flight was shortened by 42 minutes because of problems at ground
telemetry stations.
   The jet burned so much fuel while sitting on the runway waiting
for takeoff that there wasn't enough left for the scheduled
one-hour flight.
   ``It was a very easy airplane to fly,'' said Ferguson, adding,
``I would be happy to put fuel in it and fly it this afternoon.''
   The jet reached an altitude of 12,500 feet and a speed of about
280 mph. The two-tone gray jet with stubby wings and a V-shaped
tail touched down smoothly in a light rain.
   The YF-22 was built by Lockheed, General Dynamics Corp. and
Boeing Co. It was unveiled in Palmdale Aug. 29, two days after the
YF-23, built by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., made
its first flight.
   Lockheed Vice President Sherman Mullin, head of the YF-22
project, said he could not compare the two planes because he didn't
have enough information about the YF-23.
   Each team has spent about $600 million producing two prototype
jets each.
   ``It's obviously an extremely important program to us,'' said
Mullin. ``(But) it's not a program that's going to make or break
the Lockheed Corp.''
   Both planes are built of advanced composite materials. The
Lockheed aircraft has stubby wings. The Northrop fighter has a
longer, cigarlike fuselage and a wingspread that looks like a kite.
   ``This is a great day from a technological perspective,'' said
Gary L. Denman, who heads an Air Force research division. ``I can
assure you, what's out there in the airplane is the best in the
world.''
   Survival of the advanced fighter program was threatened by
Congress until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense contracts.
   If Northrop and McDonnell Douglas win the contract, the YF-23
would be built in California. The Lockheed-General Dynamics-Boeing
team plans to build YF-22s in Marietta, Ga., if it wins. The
selection is due in 1991.
   The $51 million cost of each jet is about twice that of the Air
Force's present top fighter, the F-15 Eagle.

   Many city officials agree with the students
who forced the University of the District of Columbia to close
because of their frustration with the mayoral appointees running
the school, a university trustee said Saturday.
   The protestors seized of a number of university offices
Wednesday because they believe the school's programs are being run
by a board of trustees made up of pals of Mayor Marion Barry rather
than by educators, Alonza Evans said.
   ``They wanted to know why they didn't have big name trustees who
could bring in millions of dollars in donations ... rather than
just some of (Barry's) political cronies,'' he told reporters
before returning to closed-door negotiations among students,
administrators and trustees.
   Trustees at UDC, a public institution with about 12,000
students, are nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the council
members. They cannot be forced to resign.
   The students have demanded a number of academic improvements in
return for leaving one of the campus' main buildings so classes can
resume. They also asked the 11 mayoral appointees to the 15-member
board to resign immediately, a demand that was rejected Friday.
   At least three City Council members have said they also would
like board members to resign. Council members plan to call a
hearing soon to devise a new way of appointing board members,
Councilman James Nathanson said.
   ``We have been very dissatisfied with performance of the board,
we are looking for a way to restructure the board,'' Nathanson said
last week.
   The trustees admit the school, which has had five presidents or
acting presidents in the last eight years, is in trouble and have
offered to make changes, Stanley said.
   Regardless of the outcome of talks, classes will resume Monday,
according to Trustee A. Knighton Stanley.
   The students say otherwise.
   ``School will remain closed until this matter is ended,''
student leader Mark Thompson said before talks began Saturday.
``Honestly, right now, we don't anticipate an end by Monday.''
   He also said the students will not compromise on their
insistence that the board members resign.
   That stand could backfire on the students, said Evans, a 1978
alumnus who was appointed by the school's alumni organization, not
the mayor.
   ``I have been saying for four days that the students have
legitimate concerns,'' he said. ``But we are prepared to resume
classes Monday.''
   The protest led Trustee Nira Long to resign as the board's
chairwoman effective Oct. 16, and that was a significant victory,
he said.
   Students have complained that school officials have threatened
to remove them forcibly if they are not out by Monday.

   Beirut hostage Jon Turner's high school sent
1,343 balloons loose at its homecoming football game - one balloon
for every day of his captivity.
   A slip of paper in each balloon carried Turner's name and date
of capture from the Beirut university where he taught: Jan. 24,
1987 - 1,343 days before Friday's game.
   ``I hope God listens and I hope these balloons reach him so that
Jon will be back soon,'' said his wife, Badr Turner, a Lebanese
native who was watching her first American football game.
   Turner graduated from Boise High School in 1965 and his mother,
Estelle Ronneburg, still lives in town.
   ``We want people to know that we haven't forgotten Jon,'' said
Libby Shivers, who attended Boise High with Turner and organized
the launch.
   Turner is among six U.S. hostages in Lebanon. There are seven
other Western captives, four Britons, two West Germans and an
Italian.

<HEAD>Abortion Foes Protest Restored Planned Parenthood Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several hundred abortion opponents broke
their credit cards into pieces outside a department store Saturday
to protest a company's decision to restore funding to Planned
Parenthood.
   Abortion rights advocates got the Dayton Hudson Foundation to
reconsider its earlier decision to cut Planned Parenthood funding
with similar protests and threats of a holiday season boycott.
   About 400 abortion foes staged their protest outside a Target
store. Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. operates Target
stores, as well as Dayton's, Marshall Field's, Mervyn's and
Hudson's stores in 33 states.
   Brian Gibson, executive director of Pro-Life Action Ministries
Inc., urged protesters to boycott Dayton Hudson stores for at least
one year. Some protesters snapped their Dayton Hudson credit cards
and collected the pieces to send to company officials.
   The foundation funded Planned Parenthood for 22 years before
deciding in August to suspend the aid in an effort to distance
itself from abortion controversy.
   After abortion rights' groups threatened to start a holiday
boycott the day after Thanksgiving and hundreds of customers cut up
their Dayton's credit cards, the Foundation last week announced it
was restoring its $18,000 grant to Planned Parenthood for a
restricted community education fund.
   Planned Parenthood Executive Director Thomas Webber has said
that money from the Foundation never paid for abortion services.
The agency provides birth-control add gynecological services, as
well as abortions.
   Gibson told protesters, ``Dayton Hudson's gift to Planned
Parenthood is like this organization giving money to the Nazis and
saying, `Use this for your super race, just don't use it for your
gas chambers.'''

   Iraq's foreign minister made a surprise appearance in Jordan on
Saturday, giving rise to speculation that Saddam Hussein might be
seeking to circumvent the economic embargo or open new diplomatic
maneuvers.
   President Bush meanwhile sought to solidify the international
condemnation of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait in a series of
meetings with other world leaders in New York beginning Saturday.
   In the gulf region, the multinational force took on a more
multinational character. Britain launched a deployment that was to
include thousands of ground troops, Egyptian reinforcements were on
their way, and the first French Foreign Legionnaires arrived in
Saudi Arabia.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Saturday the
Soviet Union also would be willing to send troops into military
action in the Persian Gulf if it is sanctioned by the United
Nations.
   ``We will comply with any decision, with any resolution of the
Security Council. . . . And that would include anything regarding
the involvement of the Soviet troops under the flag, under the
auspices, of the United Nations,'' he said in a taped interview for
broadcast Sunday on NBC News' ``Meet the Press.''
   France warned Saturday it would retaliate if it turns out Iraq
was behind a grenade attack that killed a French child and injured
17 people Thursday night in Djibouti. The small Red Sea country
provides support bases for French forces deployed in the gulf
region.
   If Iraq is found responsible, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
said, ``there will be a response from France and - you better
believe it - it will be appropriate to the hateful nature of this
attack.''
   Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said Saturday most
European Community embassies in Kuwait City, including Belgium's,
will probably close next week because the situation is becoming
unbearable. The Iraqis have cut off water and energy supplies to
the embassies.
   At the same time, Iraq backed off a threat to deprive non-Arab
foreigners of food under new rationing beginning Monday. The threat
came last week in a Foreign Ministry memorandum sent to non-Arab
embassies, Western diplomats said.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Trade and Finance Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh as saying Saturday that rationed food would be
provided equally to all, and calling earlier reports part of a
``rabid campaign against Iraq.''
   An estimated 650,000 foreigners remain in Iraq and Kuwait, of
the more than 2 million there before the invasion.
   It was the second time in two weeks Iraq made a drastic threat
against foreigners and then rescinded it.
   Last week, Baghdad told Western diplomats that harboring
foreigners was a crime punishable by death - a threat Western
governments interpreted as directed at their envoys. A day later,
Iraqi officials said the decree applied only to Iraqi citizens.
   In an interview over Belgian TV from New York, where he was
attending the U.N. General Assembly, Eyskens said water and
electricity to the Belgian Embassy were cut, ``food has practically
run out and psychological pressure is enormous,'' with Iraqi troops
ringing the embassy.
   Eyskens said Britain may continue to hold out, but almost all
other EC countries probably will close their embassies, too. The
U.S. Embassy still defies Iraqi closure demands.
   Bush was in New York to attend the World Summit for Children at
the United Nations. But the gulf crisis was high on his agenda.
   He set weekend and Monday meetings with leaders including
Shevardnadze and prime ministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain and
Toshiki Kaifu of Japan. On Monday, Bush was to make a major speech
on the gulf to the General Assembly.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz visited Amman on Saturday,
meeting with King Hussein and then returning to Baghdad.
   Jordan was a principal trading partner of Iraq before the
invasion, and even after the United Nations approved the trade
embargo, some supplies continued to flow through Jordan.
   Iraq imported three-quarters of its food before the sanctions
started. It imposed rationing of some staples as a result of the
embargo. New nationwide rationing on Monday is to cover rice,
flour, sugar, tea and cooking oil.
   Jordan has been battered economically by the sanctions, and
agreed only reluctantly to abide by them. It was not known whether
Aziz specifically sought a loosening of the embargo in Saturday's
talks, but Baghdad is believed to have made similar overtures to
Iran, with which it recently patched up relations.
   Jordan's difficult position was underlined Saturday when the
king postponed for 48 days convening of the regular session of
Parliament, which had been set for Monday.
   The monarch gave no reason, but some lawmakers saw it as an
attempt to muzzle strong pro-Iraqi sentiment in the legislature.
   Although Jordan condemned the Iraqi invasion, it has spoken out
strongly against the U.S.-led foreign military deployment in the
region.
   The U.S. contingent stood almost alone early in the crisis, but
allies have been contributing larger and larger shares of troops
and equipment.
   The first desert-hardened units of the French Foreign Legion
arrived Saturday in Saudi Arabia, joining the largest deployment of
French forces overseas since Algeria's 1954-62 war of independence.
The bulk of French ground forces - 4,000 troops - are expected to
arrive Sunday.
   France will have about 13,000 troops in and around Saudi Arabia
when the deployment is completed.
   A monthlong British deployment of up to 9,000 ground forces was
under way, British officials said. The logistical landing ship Sir
Tristram sailed Friday night from England, and hundreds of troops
left by air from bases in England and Germany.
   Egyptian military sources said Saturday about 1,000 Egyptian
soldiers had left the port of Alexandria for Saudi Arabia. Gen.
Mohammed Ali Bilal, commander of Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia,
said he expected the number of his troops in the kingdom to reach
20,000 within the next 15 days.
   The United States has sent about 165,000 soldiers to the gulf
region, most of them in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon said Iraq had
boosted its forces to 430,000 in and around Kuwait.
   In other developments Saturday:
   -Maj. Gen. William G. Pagonis, commander of U.S. military
logistics in Saudi Arabia, said the supply flow was on schedule and
could sustain U.S. forces for more than a month in an all-out war
with Iraq. He called his supply problems ``peanuts'' compared to
those facing Iraq.
   -The Indian passenger ship Akbar moved out of Iraqi waters with
1,700 Indian refugees as the Tipu Sultan approached the southern
gulf port of Dubai with 700 others. The Al-Safeer, also Indian,
brought out 725 refugees earlier this month.
   -Iranian and Iraqi newspapers carried editorials warning of a
flood of refugees in case war broke out and cautioning Moscow not
to play into Washington's hands.
   The English-language Baghdad Observer said, ``It is paramount
that Moscow should not miss the historic opportunity of playing a
positive role which it can do without risking its fundamental
economic, political and financial interests.''

   Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro gave
President Bush a souvenir Saturday of her country's shift toward
democracy: a confiscated AK-47 rifle cut in half by a blowtorch.
   Mrs. Chamorro said the Soviet-made weapon was seized from a
civilian as part of her government's efforts to pacify the country
after a decade of rule under the Sandinistas.
   The two presidents met in advance of Sunday's World Summit for
Children at the United Nations.
   Speaking in Spanish, Mrs. Chamorro said, ``This is a souvenir of
the peace that I am bringing about in my country. I want to give it
to you as a sign of the end of the war and the beginning of our
democracy.''
   Mrs. Chamorro, a newspaper publisher, defeated Sandinista
President Daniel Ortega in free elections last February and took
office two months later.
   ``I don't know if you really like the gift,'' said Mrs.
Chamorro.
   ``I do, I do like the gift,'' Bush assured her. Aides said later
he planned to display the disabled weapon in a special trophy room
at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.
   The Sandinistas distributed rifles to the populace in their
closing weeks in power, and Mrs. Chamorro's government has since
been rounding up the weapons.
   Bush assured Mrs. Chamorro he would make a special effort to
ensure that Nicaragua gets the full $200 million in aid for fiscal
1991 that Bush has asked for, notwithstanding the United States'
current budget difficulties.
   ``The president and the secretary (Secretary of State James
Baker III) made it clear that Nicaragua was a priority ... and
we'll do everything we can to provide as much of that amount as
possible,'' a senior administration official said.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said Mrs. Chamorro
also told Bush that a new passed law against arms trafficking in
Nicaragua will help ``strengthen her ability to crack down on any
continuing arms to the FMLN,'' the leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Mrs. Chamorro, speaking with reporters after her meeting with
Bush, stressed her country's need for humanitarian aid as it
struggled to rebuild.
   Speaking through an interpreter, she said she is ``not going to
allow that 50 years of struggle for democracy in Nicaragua, which
is now only five months old, should fail because of economic
need.''

<HEAD>Goverment Seeks to Revoke Lockheed Retirement Policy for Test
Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is suing Lockheed Corp. over
its mandatory retirement age for test pilots.
   The lawsuit filed Friday by the Equal Employent Opportunity
Commission seeks to allow Kenneth Wier, 59, to keep his job as a
chief test pilot past his birthday on Oct. 20. Lockheed requires
mandatory retirement at age 60.
   Lockheed has warned Wier he will face retirement if he does not
give up his pilot's job and accept a ground position by Monday.
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court seeks to overturn the age
limit, plus back pay and possible reinstatement for test pilots
forced to retire under the policy.
   U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. denied an EEOC motion to
temporarily block the retirement policy while the suit is pending.
Lockheed officials expressed surprise at the federal agency's
action.
   ``We don't know why they decided to do this now, with this
pilot,'' company spokesman Jim Ragsdale said.
   Lockheed says its retirement policy is based on commercial
airline policy, which also mandates retirement at age 60.
   ``The physical and psychological demands on Lockheed pilots are
significantly greater than those placed on pilots in commercial
aviation,'' Lockheed lawyers argued in court documents. ``Certainly
no lesser standard can be applied.''
   Wier, of Santa Ana is currently chief test pilot for the U2 and
TR1 reconnaissance plane programs, a job he has held for 18 years,
Ragsdale said.
   Wier's record is excellent and his performance has shown no
deterioration in the past few years, Ragsdale said.
   Court documents say Wier has flown more than 235 types of planes
in his 35 years as a pilot. He has flown for Lockheed for 24 years.

   A special Senate counsel recommended more than
two weeks ago that the Ethics Committee clear two of the five
senators under investigation for their ties to savings and loan
operator Charles H. Keating Jr., sources confirmed Saturday.
   The confidential Sept. 10 report of Robert S. Bennett said there
was inadequate evidence to pursue the case against Sens. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz., but advised the panel to
look further in the case of the three others - Democratic Sens.
Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and
Alan Cranston of California, the sources said.
   Neither Bennett nor any of the six members of the ethics panel,
led by Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., would comment on the
disclosure, originally made late Friday, about the special
counsel's recommendations or why the committee has yet to act upon
them despite three interim meetings.
   And none of the senators targeted by the probe said he had any
formal word about Bennett's findings, though McCain's spokesman,
Scott Celley, said: ``We presume it's true, since there's been no
denial. The senator is pleased to hear this ... and hopes the
Ethics Committee will vote these recommendations soon. Certainly he
hopes it will have acted before the election. There is an old
saying, `Justice delayed is justice denied.'''
   None of the five is up for re-election this year, but some
sources, talking on condition of anonymity, said they believed
Heflin and other members of the ethics panel are reluctant to take
any definitive action in the heated political atmosphere,
particularly at a time when the Senate is burdened with crucial
floor business over the budget and other issues.
   ``I wouldn't look for a thing until after election day,'' said
one aide close to the case. ``Believe me a lot of senators on both
sides of the aisle feel that way. I can't count the number of them
who have told me, `There, but for the grace of God, go I,' and want
to move the issue off center stage.''
   If Glenn and McCain were cleared, Republicans could point to the
fact that those remaining under scrutiny in Congress are all
Democrats, and some GOP aides suggested that may have something to
do with the delay. But Republicans still would have no monopoly on
finger-pointing in the S &amp; L debacle, with President Bush's son,
Neil, facing serious allegations over his dealings in a Colorado
case.
   And conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., an Ethic
Committee member and close political ally of McCain, said earlier
in the week the committee is moving as fast as it can. ``Do you
suggest we don't work every angle?'' he asked. ``We just have a
heavy load.''
   All five senators subject to the investigation have acknowledged
intervening with banking regulators on behalf of Keating, but say
they did so in a proper manner consistent with their duties toward
any constituent seeking help. Collectively, they received $1.3
million in campaign contributions from Keating and his associates.
   The three senators who, under Bennett's recommendation, would
remain under investigation declined direct comment on that
prospect. Riegle's spokeswoman, Karolyn Wallace, said ``The
committee is in stage one of a possible three-stage process.
Senator Riegle is confident its review will find his conduct to
have been proper.''
   Keating controlled Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.,
whose failure has been estimated to cost the taxpayers $2 billion.
His family is from Ohio; he had a hotel project in Michigan and his
principal corporation operated in Arizona, where his enterprises
once pumped an estimated $100 million annually into the economy and
had a payroll of 50,000.
   Keating, charged with fraud in the sale of more than $200
million in risky junk bonds, is in jail in Los Angeles, unable to
make $5 million bail.

<HEAD>Spanish Director Pleased With Movie Ratings Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An award-winning Spanish director whose
latest film received an X rating in the United States said he hopes
a change in classifying adult-oriented movies will bring his work
to a wider American audience.
   ``I'm very pleased because this means there will be a new market
for the film,'' Pedro Almodovar told El Pais newspaper in a story
published Saturday.
   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' the 38-year-old director's seventh
feature film, was rated X earlier this year by the Motion Picture
Association of America because of the movie's explicit sexual
scenes. The film tells the story of a former mental patient who
kidnaps a pornographic film star and ex-drug addict, who eventually
falls in love with him.
   Almodovar and the film's distributor, Miramax Films, sued in May
to get the film's rating changed to R, which prohibits minors
unless accompanied by a parent. The film was finally distributed
without a rating.
   Many U.S. movie houses shied away from X-rated films because of
the perceived link to hard-core sexual films, which often use the X
rating in advertisements. The X rating, the only category not
copyrighted by the film association, prohibits viewers under 18
years old.
   The X rating was eliminated Wednesday in favor of a new NC-17.
The R rating remains intact, as does the PG-13, PG and G ratings.
   The first beneficiary of the new rating system is Philip
Kaufman's formerly X-rated film on the life of author Henry Miller,
``Henry and June,'' from Universal Pictures, scheduled for release
Oct. 5.
   ``We all feel that Universal's protest over the rating (of
Kaufman's film) was the determining factor,'' said film producer
Agustin Almodovar, the director's brother.
   Agustin Almodovar said he and his brother would seek a new
rating for ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   The new rating ``would open the possibility of showing the film
in at least 100 theaters of the most conservative states where it
was refused because it had no rating.''
   Pedro Almodovar's ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''
has grossed nearly $30 million in worldwide sales and is the
biggest box office hit in Spanish history. Actress Jane Fonda has
bought the rights for a U.S. production.
   Almodovar, who worked for the telephone company in central Spain
before getting involved in underground productions, has based many
of his films on confusion over sexual roles, unrequitted love and
the hassles of life in modern Spain.
   He said recently he would like to change the tenor of his work
and has purchased the rights to ``Time for Friendship,'' a short
story set in North Africa by American author Paul Bowles.
   The director added that he felt the movie association's
decisions seemed biased against foreign films.
   Another Miramax-distributed film, British director Peter
Greenaway's ``The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' also
was rated X.
   ``I don't think I would be overly modest in saying that it was
we Europeans, or my brother and I if you like, who put our necks on
the line for a principle,'' he said.
   Other X-rated films of high artistic quality have included
1969's ``Midnight Cowboy,'' 1973's ``Last Tango in Paris,'' 1969's
``if...'' and 1971's ``A Clockwork Orange.''
   There is no rating system for films in Spain, which emerged 14
years ago from the rigid censorship of the 36-year dictatorship of
Gen. Francisco Franco.
   Spanish state television features striptease acts on prime time
shows, and two of the three new private TV channels compete for
audience with parades of topless - and sometimes bottomless - young
women.

   Five U.S. soldiers were injured
Saturday in a helicopter crash during a night training mission in
the Saudi desert, according to a U.S. military statement.
   It said the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter belonged to the 17th
Cavalry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. No details on the crash
or the condition of the soldiers were immediately available.
   The names of the soldiers were withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   It was the fourth crash of a U.S. military helicopter since the
deployment to the Persian Gulf region following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. There have been no deaths reported in the
crashes.
   Two U.S. soldiers were killed and three injured in vehicle
accidents in the gulf. A Saudi man was killed in a collision
between taxi and a Marine Corps pickup truck.
   Saturday's crash came shortly after the release of a statement
by the U.S. Command Center saying the number of injuries during
Operation Desert Shield had been ``surprisingly low.'' A report
from Fort Rucker, Ala., found the number of accident-related
injuries lower than when troops are at bases in the United States.

   A Soviet Progress M-5 cargo space craft carrying

Mir space station, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and
Gennady Strelakov were shown on Soviet television with items that
the supply craft was to carry back to Earth, including canisters
containing crystals grown in space. The crystals are used in
manufacturing computer chips.
   Manakov and Strekalov boarded the space station in early August,
replacing Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin.
   Solovyev and Balandin, using a furnace in the special
``Krystall'' module docked to the Mir, produced 23 pure crystals
from February to August. Authorities said the crystals were worth
about $1 million each, and could make the current project the first
profitable space mission.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush promised Colombian President
Cesar Gaviria on Saturday that he will seek special trade benefits
for Colombia in recognition of that nation's efforts to curb
international drug trafficking.
   Gaviria told a news conference after a meeting between the two
presidents here that Bush's plan includes eased tariffs on
Colombian flowers, the Latin country's second biggest export after
coffee.
   The White House confirmed that Bush would seek benefits for
Colombia under a Caribbean Basin proposal that will be sent to
Congress next week. The president's proposal, if approved by
Congress, would make Colombian flowers duty free, White House
deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said.
   Gaviria met with reporters after conferring with Bush and aides
to both presidents in the Waldorf Astoria. He said the United
States was ``very satisfied'' with Colombia's efforts in the drug
wars.
   Gaviria said that Bush ``indicated we deserve special treatment
... They are announcing that the Caribbean Basin Initiative will be
extended for some Colombian products.''
   That will include flowers, he said. His country exports 80
percent of its flower crop to the United States.
   The administration, responding to complaints from American
growers, had accused Colombia of ``dumping'' cut flowers in this
country at unreasonably low prices.
   As a result, the United States had sharply increased tariffs on
Colombian flowers.
   Gaviria said Bush also thanked him for Colombia's support in the
United Nations Security Council for the international embargo and
other moves to pressure Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw
his troops from Kuwait.
   Bush also expressed gratitude for Colombia's increase in oil
production in the crisis.
   The White House said Bush told Gaviria of concerns that market
speculators were driving up the price of oil.
   The Colombian president was asked if Bush seemed optimistic or
pessimistic about the chances of avoiding war. ``I only can say
that he is realistic,'' Gaviria said. ``He knows all the
limitations he has in the Middle East.''
   ``He has the hope that we will not have a war there,'' he added.
   Discussing the war against drugs, Bush expressed concern over a
new wave of terrorism in Colombia ``and the need for both countries
to deal forthrightly with the drug situation,'' a White House
statement said.
   It said that Bush raised the idea of ``consensual'' boarding of
ships suspected of carrying drugs. Gaviria said he would look into
the process of getting approval for the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect
ships at sea.

<HEAD>Mormon Church Gets Recognition For First Soviet Branch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mormon Church has gained recognition
for its first branch in the Soviet Union, the church said Saturday.
   The Soviet Union's Council on Religious Affairs has registered
the Leningrad Branch of the Mormon Church, the Utah-based church
said.
   Mormon officials said efforts to obtain official recognition of
the church in the Soviet Union go back to June 1987.
   The Soviet parliament last week adopted a new freedom of
religion law, easing decades of strict prohibitions on religious
instruction at home and in private schools. The law also forbids
the government from interfering with religious activities and
improves the legal status of religious organizations.
   Mormon missionary work in the Soviet Union is proceeding on a
limited basis, conducted in members' homes. Church services also
are held in members' homes, said church spokesman Don LeFevre.
   Under Soviet law, each congregation of a religious organization
must be registered separately. When 20 or more members reside in
any one political district, they may apply for recognition, the
church said in a news release.
   The 7.5-million-member church provided no estimates of
membership in the Soviet Union except to say it was small.
   The Leningrad Branch will be administered as a unit of the
Baltic District of the Finland Helsinki East Mission. There is no
mission in the Soviet Union.
   Representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints were notified of the branch recognition during a Sept. 19
meeting in Moscow with Evgenii Chernetsov, head of the nation's
religious affairs section for non-Russian Orthodox religions,
LeFevre said.

   Volunteers trying to bring a little
cheer to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf loaded care packages with
books, magazines, chewing gum and other goodies Saturday -
including letters from school children.
   People from all over Arkansas traveled to Little Rock to make
contributions.
   Paul Howell, vice president of the state Council of Vietnam
Veterans of America, and fellow veteran C.D. Smith, both of Little
Rock, spearheaded the care package effort.
   ``We know how valuable, both of us being combat veterans, this
is to the troops,'' Howell said, adding that besides providing
support for the troops, the effort gave worried families and
friends left behind a chance to help.
   ``We give them a sudden burst of energy in a positive direction,
to take their frustrations in not knowing what to do, and put them
into this project,'' Howell said.
   Boxes were packed with gifts including shaving lotion, lip balm,
toilet paper and dozens of other items.
   Howell said response to the project dubbed Operation Desert
Relief has been overwhelming and the most touching gifts were the
children's letters.
   ``That's pretty heavy - children that don't know these people
and they're writing in support, showing their love for these
strangers,'' he said. ``We're talking children that don't even know
what the price of freedom is, but they're growing up fast in this
situation.''
   Organizers don't know how the goods will be distributed, but
they worked with military authorities to make sure the boxes met
regulations.
   Perhaps the most-prized donation was an autographed football
from University of Arkansas head coach Jack Crowe and the Razorback
team, accompanied by a letter of support.
   ``That's very warming to our hearts,'' Howell said. ``That's
something we're very proud of.''

<HEAD>Principal at Nationally Recognized School Demoted Over Altered
Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elementary school principal recently
honored by the White House has been demoted after investigators
concluded the school faked report cards, doctored achievement tests
and inflated attendance records.
   Michael Kesselman, who two weeks ago received a White House
award for excellence at his school, was transferred Friday to
another school where he will teach social studies.
   Dade County School Superintendent Paul Bell said the school
board's investigation did not turn up any evidence that Kesselman
altered school documents.
   ``In none of the interviews conducted by the investigators was
there anyone who said they saw him change anything,'' Bell said.
``The substantiated facts lead to the conclusion that at best Dr.
Kesselman is guilty of administrative incompetence.''
   ``Errors were made,'' Kesselman said, but pointed out that
investigators cleared him of intentional wrongdoing. ``I've had
nine years of exemplary evaluations as an administrator, so I must
have been doing something right.''
   Kesselman made $66,530 a year as principal at North Beach
Elementary School. As a teacher, he'll receive $49,400.
   His departure was met by protests from supporters and PTA
leaders who credit him with gaining recognition from President Bush
and the U.S. Education Department as a National School of
Excellence.
   Investigators checked a selection of achievement test answer
sheets and found clear evidence that they had been altered to
improve scores. Evidence of doctoring was found on 53 of 62 tests.
In some cases, wrong answers were erased and changed to correct
answers.
   ``No one saw anyone change the test scores, but Kesselman was
responsible for securing the scores,'' Bell said.
   The investigation also found that 75 students who were on the
school rolls during the 1989-90 school year did not attend the
school. Some phantom students even got report cards.

   Cracking down on black market

minimum amounts of goods when they leave the country on trips this
winter.
   The government also barred Romanians and foreign travelers from
taking more than a day's supply of food across borders from Oct. 1
through April 30.
   ``This decision is a reaction to confront the hemorrhage of
Romanian goods across the border, which is squeezing the Romanian

Sirbu said.
   Romanians seeking foreign currency or scarce foods like meat and
sugar are selling items such as carpets, clothing and tents in
Turkey, Hungary and Bulgaria.
   The government also restricted imports of foreign cars. Sirbu
said Romanians were buying second-hand gas guzzlers in Austria,
West Germany and Holland.
   ``Most of these western cars have powerful engines, so they eat
more gasoline,'' Sirbu said. Gasoline is also scarce in Romania.

<TEXT>
   India and Pakistan are trading ever
harsher accusations before the U.N. General Assembly, even as other
speakers welcome the easing of tension and rivalries in some other
parts of the world.
   In speeches Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister, Sahabzada Yaqub
Khan, accused India of reneging on a 40-year-old pledge of
self-determination for the Kashmir. He urged the international
community to ``exert its moral and political influence to support
the struggle of the people of Kashmir.''
   External Affairs Minister Inder Kumar Gujral of India charged in
his speech that Pakistan armed and assisted terrorists for more
than eight years in the Indian Punjab. Recently Pakistan ``has
chosen to extend these practices'' to the northern territory of
Kashmir, he said, where thousands have died since Indian military
forces began a crackdown in mid-January.
   Gujral said Pakistan ``characteristically denied responsibility
and involvement in these acts'' and now tries ``to justify them on
the pretext of support to religious fundamentalism'' in violation
of international law and good neighborliness.
   Yaqub Khan described the upheaval in Kashmir as a ``spontaneous
uprising'' that 300,000 Indian security forces people are trying to
crush.
   The two countries have twice gone to war over the Kashmir, in
1947-48 and in 1965. The wars have left Kashmir divided into
Pakistani and Indian sectors.
   Both foreign ministers accused the other of rejecting proposals
for resolving their disputes and building confidence.
   Yaqub Khan said that at two high-level meetings in July and
August, ``the Indian side evaded the core issues, namely discussion
of the Kashmir dispute and redeployment of forces to peacetime
locations'' in the region.
   Gujral said India and Pakistan ``can have a great future if we
respect each other's integrity and unity and once Pakistan desists
from the temptation of interfering in our internal affairs.''
   He said that in that spirit, ``I will not refer to the gross
flouting of human rights in Pakistan,'' and the dismissal of Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   ``That is Pakistan's internal matter, even though democrats
everywhere feel concerned,'' he said.
   Ms. Bhutto, elected in 1988, was thrown out of office by
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan last month. Sunday she was to appear
before a court that will decide whether she can participate in
politics in the future.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's highest court ruled in favor
of East Germany's former Communists on Saturday and threw out a
plan for holding united German elections on Dec. 2.
   The Federal Constitutional Court said the election format would
deny small parties a fair chance at power in the united Germany
that will be created on Wednesday.
   Although the ruling will not halt the historic merger, it is a
victory for the now-reformed Communists who once ruled East Germany
and increases the chances they will win seats in a ew Parliament.
   The decision also will force lawmakers to scramble this week to
come up with an alternative election plan and avoid postponing the
first united German elections in 60 years.
   Meanwhile, the top lawman in West Berlin warned of an ``alarming
security situation in East Berlin,'' where leftist radicals have
been reported to be planning riots to protest Germany unity.
   West Berlin Interior Minister Erich Paetzold, in a letter to
police officials in both Berlins, called on officers to work
together next week to contain violence as their departments merge.
   About 5,000 people marched Saturday from West Berlin to East
Berlin to protest what they called ``the annexation'' of East
Germany by West Germany.
   The protest was called by a women's group demanding greater
rights in a united Germany.
   Although it is popularly called German unification, in fact East
Germany is essentially dissolving itself and acceding to the larger
nation, whose laws will supplant East Germany's.
   East Germany braced for growing unrest in its final days as a
nation.
   Inmates seized prison rooftops in Dresden, Buetzow and Leipzig
on Saturday to protest a prisoner amnesty plan that would exempt
those convicted of violent crimes. Many claim they were falsely
imprisoned under the Communists.
   In East Berlin, authorities made 15 arrests after hundreds of
young people rampaged Friday night through the city's main square,
Alexanderplatz, following a soccer match. East Berlin has become
increasingly violent since borders to the West were opened.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be in charge of a united
Germany after Wednesday.
   Kohl plans to add four East Germans to his Cabinet. West
Germany's Parliament also will add 144 lawmakers chosen late Friday
from the 400-member East German Parliament.
   Among those East German lawmakers are 24 members of the reformed
Communists, who are the third-largest party in East Germany but
would be only a small political voice in a greater Germany.
   West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel said he hoped the
combined Parliament this week would come up with a new election
plan quickly enough to still hold elections on Dec. 2.
   The constitutional court's decision was based on a complaint
brought by the former Communists, the environmental Greens
coalition, and the far-right Republicans.
   Hans Christian Stroebele, spokesman for the Greens, hailed the
decision as ``sweet success against the arrogance of the cocky
dominant parties.''
   The rejected election plan was the result of a compromise in
August between the conservative Christian Democrats, the top party
in both German lands; and the main opposition; the left-leaning
Social Democrats.
   Under the election plan, parties would need to win 5 percent of
the vote across a united Germany to get a seat in Parliament.
   The election treaty also would have allowed smaller parties to
form alliances with larger parties and share ballots, allowing
small parties to get the necessary 5 percent.
   But the former Communists and the rightist Republicans have
virtually no chance of winning 5 percent of the total German vote,
nor of finding mainstream parties willing to share a ballot.
   Ernst Gottfried Mahrenholz, vice president of the constitutional
court, said it was unfair to require small East German parties to
get 5 percent of the vote nationwide.
   The court also struck down the mechanism that would allow
smaller parties to be listed with larger, allied parties.
   The Social Democrats wanted the 5 percent limit to keep small,
left-leaning parties from getting in Parliament and diluting the
Social Democrats' clout in a united Germany.
   The Chrstian Democrats wanted the agreement that would allow
bigger parties to form alliances with smaller parties because
Kohl's power base is comprised of coalitions with other
conservative and centrist parties.

<HEAD>Atheists Angry After United Way Chapter Reverses Boy Scout Funding
Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Way chapter, fearing a fund-raising
backlash, reversed its decision to cut funding to a Boy Scouts
group because of protests from atheists over the scout oath,
officials said Saturday.
   Atheists blasted the decision and said they'd continue the
fight. They oppose a scout's oath to do his duty ``to God and my
country.''
   The Genoa-Kingston United Way chapter reversed itself by an 8-1
vote late Friday and will resume its $1,250 contribution to the Boy
Scouts of America-Two Rivers Council.
   ``There was an overwhelming response from our donor base that
they wanted the Boy Scouts funded,'' United Way board chairman Jim
Ferris said at a news conference. ``There was some concern that our
ability to collect may be hurt by the previous board decision.''
   Robert Sherman, a spokesman for the northern Illinois chapter of
American Atheists Inc., based in Austin, Texas, said the United Way
group violated its promise not to support an organization that
practices religious discrimination. ``They are soliciting money
from atheists and others under a promise that these funds would be
used for human care services without discrimination,'' Sherman said
at a news conference.
   ``There is an impression that society will tolerate the
violation of atheists' rights,'' he said.
   The Genoa-Kingston United Way group, based about 60 miles
northwest of Chicago, voted to halt the Boy Scout funding Aug. 29.
The Boy Scout council is based in the small north Chicago suburb of
St. Charles.
   A pending federal lawsuit filed in Chicago challenges the
requirement that Boy Scouts take the oath.
   ``The charge of discrimination that the atheists are raising is
in the courts right now for a decision,'' United Way of America
spokesman Tony De Christofaro said in an interview from Alexander,
Va.
   ``That is why (local officials) reinstated the allocation,'' he
said.
   The Boy Scouts receive more than $80 million a year from United
Way agencies across the country, Christofaro said.
   The local chapter's original decision to withhold 1991 funding
made it the first of 1,400 United Way groups nationwide to take
such action.
   The atheists' group will ask the Illinois attorney general to
investigate the United Way chapter, Sherman said.
   Atheists also hope to block any future United Way grants to the
scouts with legal action and plan a federal lawsuit seeking to
revoke the Boy Scouts' national charter, granted by Congress, he
said.

<HEAD>China Supplied Rare Chemical to Iraq, Newspaper Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China sold Iraq large quantities of a rare
chemical used to make missile fuel, poison gas - and possibly
nuclear weapons - in violation of the U.N. trade embargo, a
newspaper reported.
   The Independent in its Sunday editions said it had documents
showing that around Sept. 20, a subsidiary of North China
Industries Corp. agreed to supply about seven tons of lithium
hydride to Iraq for about $1.5 million.
   The deal was struck ``in great secrecy,'' the newspaper said.
   Britain's Foreign Office said it was studying the report.
   China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, voted
for a resolution banning trade with Iraq following its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The Independent reported the U.S. Embassy in Beijing told the
Chinese Foreign Ministry it was concerned about the activities of
the Chinese firm, known as Norinco. It was not known if the
embassy's statement was related to the lithium hydride deal, it
said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has previously tried to obtain
lithium hydride, but the three Western manufacturers of the
chemical are suspicious of large orders. The chemical is used in
minute quantities in the pharmaceutical and computer industries,
the newspaper said.
   Just before the U.N. trade embargo vote, the Norinco subsidiary
sent sales material about lithium hydride to five international
arms dealers, the newspaper said.
   The company offered 10 tons of the chemical at about $210,000 a
ton. The offer was open ``to any purchaser'' and Iraq agreed to buy
seven tons.
   ``Sources suspect that they planned to fly it to Tehran, and
then forward it as `pharmaceuticals' to Baghdad,'' the newspaper
said.
   The Independent said it had copies of some of the original
documents and had seen others.
   The Iraqis are most likely to use the chemical to make missile
fuel, but it could be used to make poison gas, the newspaper said.
   Iraq's failure to obtain the chemical has held back Saddam's
ballistic missile program, it said.
   The newspaper said the chemical can be used in the manufacture
of hydrogen bombs, but Western experts do not believe Iraq has
adequate nuclear technology.
   Julian Perry-Robinson, an authority on the science of chemical
weapons, was quoted as saying the chemical is also needed for
lithium aluminum hydride, which can be used to produce nerve gases.
   Saddam has used chemical weapons against Iranians during the
seven-year Gulf War and on ethnic Kurds fighting for independence
in northern Iraq.

to argue at trial that constitutional religious freedom exempted
them from prosecution, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled
Friday.
   ``The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty
to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the
latter to ill health or death,'' the appeals court said, quoting a
1944 U.S. Supreme Court decision.
   Hermanson, 43, a former Sarasota banker, and his 39-year-old
wife were convicted last year of felony child abuse and
third-degree murder in the 1986 death of their daughter Amy from
untreated diabetes.
   In accordance with their Christian Science beliefs, the
Hermansons shunned modern medicine to treat Amy and instead relied
on prayer.
   ``As the jury could and did determine, the Hermansons'
acknowledged absolute right to hold their religious beliefs did not
permit them to exercise that right at the price of Amy's life,''
the appeals court said in its 32-page decision.
   ``I think they covered the whole ballpark with it,'' said
Assistant State Attorney Deno Economou, the lead trial prosecutor.
``I'm extremely pleased.''
   Defense attorney Thomas Dart said he would have to study the
decision further to determine whether to appeal.
   Regardless of further legal proceedings, spokesman Nathan Talbot
said the Boston-based church must maintain its efforts to make
people understand Christian Scientists' reliance on prayer.
   ``We'll just have to continue to let people know that there's an
alternative method of healing that doesn't have a perfect track
record but has been so successful that a large segment of society
relies on it,'' Talbot said.
   The Hermansons were given suspended four-year prison sentences,
placed on probation for 15 years and ordered to seek medical
treatment for their surviving children. They have moved to St.
Louis since their convictions and could not be reached for comment
Saturday. A message was left on their answering machine.
   Courts in various states have delivered split decisions in
similar cases in which parents who shun traditional medicine for
religious reasons have been charged in the deaths of their
children. In a case in July, a Christian Science couple in Boston
was convicted of manslaughter in the death of their 2{-year-old
son.

   Lights went out in some of the Big Apple's
tallest buildings Saturday in tribute to the World Summit for
Children at the United Nations.
   The Empire State Building, the Chrysler building, the Pan Am
building, the Times Tower in Times Square, the Pepsi-Cola sign over
the East River and other spots went dark at 8 p.m. for one minute.
   However, not everything went as planned. St. Patrick's Cathedral
and many other churches that had been asked to ring bells at 8 p.m.
in honor of the summit did not. Broadway theaters failed to turn
off their marquees; and the World Trade Center was supposed to dim
one tower and did not.
   Happily, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles concert at Radio City
Music Hall came through with a moment of silence. And earlier in
the day, a moment of silence was observed at Shea Stadium during a
New York Mets baseball game.
   Taxi drivers were also supposed to honk their horns at 8 p.m.
But, as Bob Bosch, who organized the tribute, said, ``I don't know
how one would tell the difference between tonight's horns and every
other night.''
   The display was to honor the 70 world leaders participating in
the historic World Summit for Children at the United Nations.
   President Bush came to town on Saturday, bringing along what he
always does - massive traffic tie-ups. The path the president takes
uptown after helicoptering in from New Jersey is always cleared of
vehicles and pedestrians.
   Most of the VIP guests were in meetings Saturday, as opposed to
a day earlier when they were bopping around town. President
Patricio Aylwin of Chile spoke at a foreign affairs forum; Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu picked up an honorary degree at New York
University; Queen Fabiola of Belgium visited the Covenant House
shelter for young runaways.
   More visible than the heads of state are those angered by their
presence. On Friday, there were three demonstrations outside the
United Nations.
   Things were a little slower Saturday. A group of U.S. veterans
demonstrated outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to protest the
meeting between Nguyen Co Thach, foreign minister of the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam, and Secretary of State James Baker.
   Later Saturday, the United Ukrainian American Organizations of
Greater New York held a protest against the signing of a new treaty
between the Ukraine and Moscow.

   President Bush, weighing new steps against Iraq,
consulted with world leaders on the Persian Gulf crisis Saturday as
a top Soviet official pledged Moscow would send troops into
military action if it were sanctioned by the United Nations.
   White House officials said Bush's blitz of personal diplomacy
with more than two dozen leaders was aimed at shoring up the
consensus of global outrage over Iraq's invasion of neighboring
Kuwait. The president will address the U.N. General Assembly on
Monday.
   Bush's appointment list over three days included Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner and
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   He conducted the first six of the meetings Saturday, concluding
with an evening session with Kaifu, whose government has pledged $4
billion to support the multinational force in the gulf and to aid
the front-line states of Jordan, Egypt and Turkey.
   Bush asked Kaifu to ensure that the money is disbursed quickly,
and the Japanese leader pledged that it would be, officials from
both sides said. Bush also urged that Tokyo increase the money it
contributes to underwrite the cost of keeping U.S. forces in Japan.
   ``It goes without saying that Japan should continue to
increase'' spending for that purpose, said Taizo Watanabe, the
spokesman for Kaifu.
   Kaifu invited Bush to make a state visit to Japan early next
year and Bush readily accepted. Solomon said the dates still must
be worked out.
   Shevardnadze, meanwhile, made a commitment to involve Soviet
forces in any action against Iraq authorized by the United Nations.
   The Soviet official said ``we will comply with any decision,
with any resolution of the Security Council. ... And that would
include anything regarding the involvement of the Soviet troops
under the flag, under the auspices, of the United Nations.'' He
made his comments in a taped interview for broadcast Sunday on NBC
News' ``Meet the Press.''
   The White House applauded Shevardnadze's comment. ``If the U.N.
should move in this direction, we would, of course, welcome Soviet
participation,'' said Roman Popadiuk, a deputy presidential press
secretary.
   Bush's diplomatic meetings are interspersed around three major
speeches he is making in New York.
   On Sunday, Bush will address the United Nations Children's
Summit, a meeting that brings together more than 70 world leaders
to plan a battle against the scourges of hunger, disease, poverty
and illiteracy. An estimated 40,000 children die every day around
the world from disease, malnutrition, crime and war.
   On Monday, Bush will address the General Assembly on the Persian
Gulf crisis, hailing the world body for its resolve against Iraqi
aggression.
   Also, before returning to Washington, he will address a meeting
of foreign ministers of 35 nations trying to conclude an agreement
to slash non-nuclear weapons in Europe. The group, the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, is struggling to produce a
treatyin time for a mid-November summit in Paris.
   The meetings with world leaders occur at a dramatic moment in
global affairs, with many nations moving toward the brink of war in
the Middle East.
   Upwards of 150,000 U.S. combat troops have been moved into the
Persian Gulf to join the forces of Arab countries, Britain, France
and other nations aligned against Iraq.
   White House officials say the systematic dismantling of Kuwait
by Iraq since the Aug. 2 invasion has caused a reassessment of how
long the world can wait to see if U.N. sanctions will work against
Baghdad.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
Friday that the United States was considering making a new request
for action to the United Nations. The U.N. already has adopted
eight resolutions condemning Iraq's aggression and imposing trade
and economic penalties, backed up by naval and air blockades.
   ``The atrocities, the devastation inside Kuwait, really are
worthy of world attention and a U.N. resolution is one way to bring
that kind of attention,'' Scowcroft said at a briefing on Bush's
trip.
   Scowcroft said it was possible the United States might seek
action that mentions the military option available under Article
42, which authorizes the use of ``all appropriate measures,''
including force, to enforce sanctions.
   Scowcroft said the gulf crisis would be discussed in most of
Bush's meetings with leaders.
   In addition to Kaifu, Bush's schedule on Saturday included talks
with Mulroney, President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, Prime Minister
Salim Al-Huss of Lebanon, President Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua
and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland.
   In his meeting with Salim, Bush pledged that U.S. contacts with
Syria concerning the Persian Gulf crisis ``would in no way be
detrimental to Lebanon,'' a White House statement said.
   Bush reassured Salim that the United States seeks the withdrawal
of all foreign forces from Lebanon. That would include Syrian
troops who occupy the country.
   On Sunday, Bush will meet with Woerner and leaders of El
Salvador, Mexico, Spain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Venezuela,
Czechoslovakia and Britain.
   Monday's schedule includes meetings with leaders of Argentina,
Uruguay and Malta. He also will see Shevardnadze, Perez de Cuellar,
Organization of African Unity Chairman Yowery Museveni of Uganda
and other African heads of state.

   The Observer newspaper reported Sunday that
British forces will retaliate with battlefield nuclear weapons if
Iraqi troops attack them with chemical gas.
   It cited as its source an unidentified senior officer attached
to the British 7th Armored Brigade, which began leaving for the
Persian Gulf on Saturday from Bremerhaven, West Germany.
   ``We do not comment on any aspect of our nuclear capability,''
said a Defense Ministry spokesman, who in line with British
practice would not allow use of his name.
   The ministry refused to say if the brigade, normally stationed
in Germany, was taking along its 155mm self-propelled howitzers,
which can fire W48 nuclear shells or conventional high explosive.
The newspaper said the nuclear shells are normally held by the
British in dual custody with American troops.
   W48 shells are equivalent to 100 metric tons of high explosive,
which is 100 times smaller than the atomic bomb dropped on
Hiroshima at the end of World War II, the report added.

<HEAD>Disaster Declaration Asked Two Weeks after Soviet Toxic Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Soviet Kazakhstan asked the
Kremlin to declare an ecological disaster in part of his republic
after an explosion at a nuclear fuel factory on Sept. 12 released a
cloud of toxic gas, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said Saturday that the blast and fire
at the Ulbinsky metallurgical plant in a workshop using beryllium
spewed toxic gas that affected ``a considerable part of the
population of Ust-Kamenogorsk.''
   Ust-Kamenogorsk, a city of about 20,000 people, lies near the
border with China and Mongolia in the Altai mountains.
   ``The public of Kazhakstan and population of the city demand
urgent measures to improve the situation and they demand
compensation for damage to their health,'' said a telegram sent on
Friday by Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the republic, to
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Nazarbayev also asked that Soviet experts be sent to
Ust-Kamenogorsk to decide on continued operation of the plant, and
he requested an investigation by independent, international
ecological experts, Tass reported.
   He was quoted as saying in the telegram that local authorities
had already declared the region an ecological disaster zone.
   Several people were injured in the blast. There was no report of
any radiation release.
   The plant is one of the largest producers of fuel for nuclear
power plants in the Soviet Union and lies in a densely populated
part of Ust-Kamenogorsk, Tass said.
   After the explosion and fire, toxic gas filled the streets and
dissipated slowly because of there was little wind. Preliminary
tests showed twice the permitted levels of beryllium in air and
water samples.
   Beryllium is a very light metal that can catch fire easily and
burn like a magnesium flash, vaporizing and releasing a deadly
smoke of beryllium oxide.
   Ust-Kamenogorsk is about 105 miles east of Semipalatinsk, where
the Soviet Union conducts its nuclear weapons tests. Residents have
campaigned against the nuclear tests, and none have taken place for
months.
   Izvestia reported shortly after the blast that officials
involved in the accident were hiding documents to avoid blame.

   Reinforcements for local police began arriving in
the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, as nationalists prepared for a rally
Sunday and a one-day strike to press demands for greater autonomy
from the Kremlin.
   Stephen Gura, a strike committee member, said as many as 500,000
people were expected to take part in the demonstration.
   Large numbers of Interior Ministry tanks and troops were
reportedly moved to the Kiev area, and one demonstration organizer
quoted local authorities as saying they were prepared to use tanks
to ``promote safety and order.''
   Peter Barsuk, secretary of the Ukrainian Republican Party,
quoted Kiev police chief V. Shaposhnikov as saying that his forces
had been issued a non-lethal gas to disperse any unruly groups.
   Police also were ordered to check cars to prevent arms from
entering the city, he said.
   ``They also received orders to arrest anyone who looks
suspicious or who looks like someone with psychiatric problems,''
Barsuk quoted Shaposhnikov as saying.
   Ukrainian-Americans in the United States said they were
receiving telephone calls from Kiev reporting the city had been
cordoned off by troops. Those reports could not be confirmed
independently. The Soviet Interior Ministry runs the national
police force, and also has its own troops and tank units.
   The Tass news agency said that local police had requested help
to control Ukrainians arriving for Sunday's rally, which was
approved by the city council. The local Communist Party opposed the
rally and the one-day strike that was to follow Monday.
   Organizers are demanding the resignation of the national
government, additional benefits for miners and rejection of a new
national union treaty, which they say exploits Ukrainians.
   Furthermore, Gura said protesters are demanding a halt to
operations at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the 1986 nuclear
disaster, and the nationalization of property controled by the
Communist Party.
   The legislature of the Ukraine, the second largest Soviet
republic, already has declared sovereignty from the Soviet Union,
giving it greater control of its economic and political life. Some
Ukrainians, particularly in Western regions that were taken over by
the Soviet Union during World War II, are pressing for full
independence.
   The Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee met on Friday
and denounced plans for the demonstration and strike, the
independent news agency Interfax reported.
   ``They have geared their efforts to seizing political power and
they don't stop at using violent methods,'' the agency quoted
Stanislav Gurenko, the party's first secretary, as saying.
   Gurenko said leaders of the Ukrainian Republican Party and Rukh,
both nationalist movements, had organized the demonstration in an
effort to destabilize the republic.
   Kiev officials, meanwhile, declared Saturday a day of mourning
for the victims of the Babi Yar massacre by Nazi occupiers 49 years
ago, the Tass news agency reported.
   Bari Yar was a ravine on the outskirts of Kiev where Nazis
killed about 35,000 Jews on Sept. 29-30, 1941. The victims had been
ordered to report to the area for resettlement, but were
machine-gunned when they arrived.
   Over the next two years, Babi Yar became a Nazi burial ground
and the remains at least 100,000 bodies, mostly Jews, were found
after the war.

   Iraqi atrocities in occupied Kuwait could
prompt the United States to return to the United Nations to seek
tougher sanctions against Saddam Hussein, possibly even military
action, the White House says.
   On Friday, Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jabir al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
gave President Bush a harrowing account of what the president
called a ``population assaulted, incarcerated, intimidated and even
murdered.''
   The narrative included tales of babies being removed from
incubators and critically ill patients being taken off life-support
systems so that the hospital machinery could be sent back to Iraq,
said national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``It was a pretty devastating account, especially in the face of
Saddam Hussein saying he is the defender of the Arabs against the
outside,'' Scowcroft said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration is moving ahead with a
test sale of 5 million barrels of stockpiled oil, despite
contentions by lawmakers and its own energy secretary that the
amount is too small.
   The Energy Department sent out formal notices of the sale Friday
as the House voted to give President Bush authority to triple its
size, as recommended a day earlier by Energy Secretary James
Watkins.
   The White House stopped short of disavowing Watkins' suggestion
that the 5-million-barrel sale announced by Bush on Wednesday was
too small to even test how the 590-million-barrel Strategic
Petroleum Reserve might work in an oil emergency.
   ``We'd have to look at'' any proposal to expand it, said Steven
Hart, a White House spokesman.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - One of the world's last great Gothic churches
was to be formally completed today, with President Bush and
thousands of others gathering on the grounds of Washington National
Cathedral to see the final stone put in place.
   It was a long time coming. It was just 83 years ago to the day
that President Theodore Roosevelt rode to Mount St. Albans, the
highest point in the capital, to see the foundation stone laid. A
crowd of 10,000 braved threatening weather to join him.
   The stone reserved to the last is a 1,000-pound piece of Indiana
limestone carved in the shape of a folded leaf or flower. It has
been on display inside, but was moved onto the grounds of the
cathedral to be lifted into place by a crane.
   The stone will rest on the southwest pinnacle of the catheral's
St. Paul Tower.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - President Bush has a plan to combat
measles and AIDS in the young but still opposes a children's rights
treaty endorsed by scores of other nations, say U.S. officials at a
conference examining those issues.
   Bush was expected to unveil the program to more than 70 other
world leaders at the two-day World Summit for Children, scheduled
to begin today.
   The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which went into
effect this month, requires nations to guarantee the survival of
children and their development. It sets new standards for fighting
child neglect, sexual exploitation and other abuse.
   But U.S. officials say they are not yet ready to support the
treaty, though it already has been ratified by 43 nations and
endorsed by more than 100 others.

<HEAD>Scottish Teacher in ``Head of the Class'' A Hoot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a lot of babble about unconventional TV
shows nowadays, mainly by people who talk about but don't watch
``Twin Peaks.'' But there are some truly unconventional shows
about.
   Case in point: ABC's veteran Tuesday series about high school
life, ``Head of the Class,'' which began its fifth season last
month. It's well-crafted, literate - and even funny.
   This can't be said of the newer high school sitcoms, NBC's
``Ferris Bueller'' and Fox's ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose.'' They're
so conventional that the students are smarter than their teachers
and high school principals.
   ABC's ``Class,'' on the other hand, is set in an honors program
class, its students are there to learn, and, as in the earlier era
of ABC's long-running ``Welcome Back, Kotter,'' the teacher knows
more than they do.
   If you haven't yet seen this season's ``Class,'' you might take
a look tonight, because it has yet another unconventional touch - a
new history teacher from Scotland played by comedian Billy
Connolly.
   Connolly, who even is from Scotland, brings a wonderful warmth
and exuberance to the show.
   Full of good will, with a musical lilt to his voice, he belies
the rumor that all Scots are dour (the rumor started in 1746 after
the Scots and the English had a frank exchange of views at a place
called Culloden).
   As Oxford-educated Billy MacGregor, Connolly succeeds Howard
Hesseman, who played the original, more laid-back teacher, Charlie
Moore, but left to pursue ``various non-series projects.''
   In the ``Class'' premiere, Moore's departure was explained as a
sudden exit to take a shot at acting. As one student jokingly put
it, he left to be in ``a low-budget musical - `Seven Brides for One
Brother.' ''
   There is some resentment of the newcomer with the strange accent
and obvious eyes for the lovely vice principal (Jeannetta Arnett).
   Most of the resentment is by Dennis (Dan Schneider), the rotund
chemistry whiz who berates the class nerd, Arvid (Dan Frischman),
for taking such an immediate liking to the new teacher.
   But it's hard not to like a guy who not only knows his history,
but also describes the first westward rush of East Germans after
the Berlin Wall came down as ``a tangled wave of bad denim.''
   In tonight's episode, Connolly, who greets his young charges
each morning with a cheery ``Good morning, geniuses,'' has to cope
with the impact of a flu epidemic on a citywide high school
Shakespeare competition.
   There might not be an epidemic at his school were it not for
Arvid. Obsessed with maintaining a perfect attendance record, he
insists on coming to class, even though he's so stricken by flu he
faints at the start of the show.
   This prompts MacGregor to tell him, ``You look like smmething
the cat dragged in, changed its mind, dragged back out again, came
back in, threw up, went back out, dragged it farther away, and
diiiiiiiied.''
   It's not said meanly, though, but in the caring tradition and
gentle humor of yesteryear's Kotter - who like MacGregor taught in
a New York school, albeit to a class that was, er, of a lower I.Q.
   There also are nice bits of byplay in ``Class'' between the
lovely vice principal and the new teacher, as when he agrees to
help out in the flu-ravaged Shakespeare competition.
   Assuming a Shakespearean look, he intones: `I would sooner mine
eyes be plucked from my head than deny thy lip's request.''
   She smiles sweetly: ``That's beautiful. But it's not
Shakespeare.''
   Yep, this is unconventional television. Don't know if it'll
survive. Why, the kids don't even say ``Surf's up.''
   But take a look at this ``Class'' tonight. You may enroll in it.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ON THE FRONTLINE OF GLOBAL DUMPING: Public TV's ``Frontline''
starts its ninth season tonight, with a 60-minute report by
``Frontline'' visitor Bill Moyers on the international export of
toxic waste from the United States. Entitled ``Global Dumping
Ground,'' it's a collaboration by Moyers, the Center for
Investigative Reporting and San Francisco public TV station KQED.
