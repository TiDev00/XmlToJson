   After peering into their crystal balls,
Italian clairvoyants predict war tensions in the Persian Gulf will
dissipate and President Mikhail Gorbachev will weather Soviet
upheaval over the coming year.
   Don't celebrate yet, though. This is from the bunch that foresaw
the failure of German unification. And not all that is augured is
good.
   ``Europe will have to defend itself from an invasion of foreign
workers and foreign investments and may have temptations of
isolationism,'' wrote Lucia Alberti, an astrologer who prints a
yearly calendar of events.
   Recession will be the major evil in most countries during 1991,
she said.
   Most Italian members of the European Association of Clairvoyants
predicted in newspaper accounts this week that not a single shot
will be fired over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   But President Bush and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may face
assassination attempts, according to Bernardo Gandolfo, a Naples
clairvoyant.

   The army has released an American priest
and an Italian cameraman held for a week, after rebel fighters held
the cameraman for two days.
   The cameraman, Giorgio Salomone, and the Rev. Joseph Bragotti,
were freed Thursday by military authorities in Lira, 130 miles
north of the capital, Kampala.
   The detentions came after Salomone was captured and held by
guerrillas from Dec. 17-19 in northern Uganda, where he and another
Italian journalist were working on a report about missionaries,
Bragotti said.
   Braggoti, hometown unavailable, said they were not abused but
that Salomone was asked to write three statements about what he saw
during his abduction by the rebels.
   Braggoti, 53, said he had been in Uganda on vacation when he
volunteered to assist the Italians in their film.

   The price of bread, sugar and rice will
increase by about 30 percent in the new year as part of the
government's austerity plan to get international loans, a newspaper
reported.
   The Budapest daily Nepszabadsag, quoting managers at state food
trading companies, said flour, cosmetics and other household goods
also will increase.
   These are suggested retail prices; final prices will be
determined by market conditions, the paper said.
   The increases are seen as necessary to revitalize industries
whose traditional subsidies have been slashed by the government as
it tries to qualify for credits from the International Monetary
Fund.
   The state railroads announced earlier in December that domestic
fares would increase by 80 percent and the national telephone
company is planning a 150 percent hike in phone charges.
   Postal services are going up by 40 percent and municipal bus
fares by 55 percent early next year.

<HEAD>China Said to Continue Military Aid To Khmer Rouge, Despite Denial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China is supplying new military
aid to Cambodia's communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, despite its
claim to have halted shipments months ago, Western intelligence and
other sources say.
   The sources also say the Cambodian government is receiving
support from thousands of Vietnamese soldiers disguised as
Cambodians. Vietnam says it has withdrawn all its troops, but the
rebels have long disputed that.
   The reports emerged this week as peace talks were stalled
between the Cambodian government and the resistance. Fighting has
intensified in western Cambodia over the past month.
   The Khmer Rouge are loading ``trucks and trucks of new Chinese
ammunition,'' said one Western intelligence official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``There is a recent increase in Chinese
supplies to the Khmer Rouge.''
   Other sources at the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet and
elsewhere along the Cambodian frontier said this week that the
Chinese are preparing fresh deliveries of ammunition in
anticipation of a government offensive.
   China is the main backer of the Khmer Rouge and two other
guerrilla groups fighting the government Vietnam installed after
invading Cambodia in late 1978. The Khmer Rouge, which was ousted
from power by the invasion, is the strongest guerrilla army.
   China said it had stopped military assistance after the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, including China and
the United States, adopted a peace plan for Cambodia in late
August.
   ``Since the five member countries of the Security Council
adopted the five documents on Cambodia, China has not provided any
military assistance, including weapons, to the Cambodian
resistance,'' China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Li Zhaoxing, said
last month.
   The guerrillas have supported the U.N. plan, which calls for a
truce followed by U.N. involvement in the country's administration
and U.N.-supervised elections. But the Vietnamese-installed
government has rejected key elements of the plan.
   Meanwhile, government forces are preparing a major offensive in
the approaching dry season, Western intelligence and guerrilla
sources say.
   They say the government is supported by Vietnamese troops who
have secretly returned to Cambodia disguised as Cambodian
government soldiers.
   Vietnam says it withdrew all troops from Cambodia in September
1989. But Western intelligence sources in Bangkok say they believe
there are 4,000 to 9,000 Vietnamese military personnel in the
country.
   They say Vietnam has supplied large amounts of ammunition to the
government in recent months.
   However, one analyst predicted that if peace talks break up, the
Khmer Rouge is in a position to win the war.
   ``If the Phnom Penh government chooses to fight it out with the
Khmer Rouge, they are making a big mistake,'' said the intelligence
analyst in Bangkok.
   ``(Khmer Rouge) support within the country is growing, and they
have the means to continue, regardless of any international cutoff.
If this peace proposal fails, it is out of the control of anyone
but Cambodians, and in the long run it is the Khmer Rouge who will
win.
   During its rule from 1975-79, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians directly through purges and executions and
indirectly through starvation and the hardship of a radical
agrarian relocation program.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle doesn't abide
discrimination at golf clubs, his office says, but he still plays
at one of the most exclusive all-male courses near the capital as
an honorary member.
   Quayle on Friday canceled a second round of golf at the
all-white Cypress Point golf club near Monterey, Calif., after he
learned the facility was mired in a racial controversy, said his
press secretary, David Beckwith.
   He had played there Thursday, unaware, Beckwith said, that the
club was ruled ineligible for its share of the 1991 AT&amp;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am tournament next month because it has no black
members.
   Quayle was ``unwilling to leave any impression that he condones
any form of discrimination,'' so he left California and returned to
Vail, Colo., where he had been on a skiing vacation, Beckwith said.
   But the spokesman said he could not explain why Quayle is an
honorary member of the Burning Tree Club in suburban Bethesda, Md.,
which bars women from its course.
   ``He encourages all clubs to adopt non-discriminatory
policies,'' Beckwith said.
   He said Quayle is not a ``dues-paying member.'' The club's
membership roster lists him as an honorary member.
   Burning Tree's members include some of the nation's most
powerful political leaders. The 68-year-old club last year lost a
court battle to regain a tax break the Maryland legislature had
revoked in 1986 because of its refusal to admit women as members or
generally allow them on the property.
   Quayle's chief of staff, Bill Kristol said in a telephone
interview, ``I don't think playing at Burning Tree is inconsistent
with opposing discrimination. Lots of people with good
anti-discriminatory records have played golf at Burning Tree.''
   Cypress Point does admit women, but it refused to admit black
members in time to conform to the Professional Golfers
Association's new guidelines that hold no host tournament club can
discriminate against blacks or women.
   ``We have no discrimination clauses in our bylaws, but we do not
have black members,'' said club pro Jim Langley. ``We have a
waiting list of approved applicants of several years, and we
couldn't bypass them.''
   Quayle went to Cypress Point at the invitation of his college
roommate, Mark Rolfing, a media golf commentator, according to
local sources. He teed off Thursday with two Cypress Point Club
members who are administration officials - Air Force Secretary
Donald B. Rice, and Ebersole Gaines, the top U.S. diplomat in
Bermuda.
   Beckwith said Quayle was assured the club had no policy of
discrimination but left Friday because he did not want to leave any
appearance of condoning discrimination.
   Asked how Quayle could be unaware of the highly publicized
banning of Cypress Point from the PGA tournament, Kristol said:
``It proves he's not spending time reading the golf pages.''
   The vice president leaves Washington tonight on a New Year's
visit to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf area.

   Indonesia plans to try leaders of a
little-known insurgent movement next month, and overseas human
rights groups should monitor the trial, one of the groups says.
   About 40 defendants face charges in three cities for alleged
activity in behalf of Aceh Merdeka, or Free Aceh, an armed
liberation group operating at the northern tip of Sumatra, Sidney
Jones, executive director of Asia Watch, said Friday.
   The cases could provide accounts of torture, killings and other
atrocities that have become routine in counterinsurgency campaigns
in the Aceh region and elsewhere in Indonesia, Asia Watch said.
   In Aceh, ``there is no question that both sides have engaged in
atrocities, but the scale and brutality of the Indonesian response
is out of all proportion to the threat posed by the insurgents,''
Ms. Jones said.
   The current outbreak of violence in the Aceh region began 18
months ago and the combined death toll on both sides has been
estimated as high as 1,000, Asia Watch said in a year-end report on
the situation.
   ``Corpses continue to be found along roads and rivers in three
districts of Aceh,'' it said. The Indonesian military ``appears to
have systematically killed at least dozens and perhaps hundreds of
suspected Aceh Merdeka supporters in revenge, as a deterrent and as
a means of disposing of prisoners.''
   Human rights violations in the Aceh region ``fall into a pattern
of systematic and gross abuses already well established in
Indonesia,'' the report said.
   It cited similar abuses in past disturbances in East Timor, East
Irian and Central Java. ``Torture techniques reported from Aceh
occur throughout Indonesia, including in Jakarta police stations
... torture reported from Aceh and standard throughout Indonesia is
the placing of a chair or table over the suspect's foot, which the
interrogator then sits on,'' it said.
   Indonesia does not admit international human rights
organizations for official observation, but Asia Watch hopes to be
represented unofficially at the open trials in the cities of Medan,
Banda Aceh and Lhokseumawe, Ms. Jones said by telephone from New
York.
   Asia Watch is affiliated with Helsinki Watch and other groups
that promote observance of human rights set forth in the 1975
Helsinki East-West agreement.
   Ms. Jones said she discussed human rights at a meeting with
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas at the United Nations this
fall, and later visited Sumatra privately.
   She quoted Alatas as telling her that Asia Watch could come to
his country officially when it ``stops taunting'' Indonesia. She
said she replied that ``international pressure is critical to bring
about improvements in the human rights situation, and what they
call taunting we call constructive criticism.''

<TEXT>
   Comedian Bob Hope, back from
a round of USO Christmas shows in the Persian Gulf region, says
American troops are in high spirits despite their desert ordeal.
   ``We found the morale over there just sensational,'' the
87-year-old Hope told a news conference Friday night at Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington.
   ``My opening line in the last week has been, `Are you ready?'''
he said. ``And, man, they all stood up with a fist and said, `We're
ready.'''
   Hope confessed that he and his entourage were tired after a
20-hour flight from Bahrain that seemed like ``the longest flight
of my career.''
   He said the gulf trip would be the last of the Christmas tours
to entertain American troops overseas that began during World War
II and continued through Korea and Vietnam.
   Hope was accompanied by his wife, Dolores, actress-singer Ann
Jillian, former Cincinnati Reds baseball star Johnny Bench and
country singer Aaron Tippin.
   Hope was asked to compare morale among the troops in the gulf
with that of Vietnam. ``They know more what they're doing,'' he
said.
   In deference to Saudi religious customs, Hope toned down the
racy jokes and did without the scantily clad beauties who have been
included in shows in years past. Reporters were banned from
covering the performances.
   Ms. Jillian and other female performers did entertain troops
aboard ship off Bahrain. ``We referred to ourselves as the
pantyhose division of Bob Hope's USO tour,'' she said.
   Portions of shows at camps across Saudi Arabia and aboard ship
will be spliced together for a 90-minute special to be telecast by
NBC on Jan. 12.
   Hope said he has been going on Christmas tours so long that in
1983 some servicemen told him that their grandfathers had seen him.
But he added: ``If anybody tells you I was in the Civil War, I'm
denying it.''

<TEXT>
   The Political Council of the Organization of
American States has appealed for reinstatement of a democratic
government in Suriname and denounced the military coup that
overthrew that nation's elected leadership.
   Twenty-four of the 32 governments in the OAS quickly joined
Venezuela's sponsorship of a resolution denouncing the Dec. 24
coup, in which President Ramsewak Shankar was forced from office.
   Suriname is a former Dutch colony located on the northern coast
of South America.
   The United States and all Latin American representatives, with
the exception of Honduras, endorsed the Venezuelan request despite
a request from the Surinamese ambassador to delay action.
   Ambassador Glenn A. Alvares had asked the council for the
postponement until ``we have sufficient information of what
happened in Suriname to act in conformity with the realities.''
   But the Venezuelan representative, Guido Grooscors, refused to
accept a delay, calling the coup an intolerable action against the
will of the people of Suriname.
   ``The use of armed force to take decisions in the political
field must be eradicated from this continent,'' he said.
   U.S. Representative Luigi Einaudi said:
   ``We cannot be silent about the events in Suriname that deprive
the Surinamese people of their rights. We cannot allow those
illegal acts to threaten the democracy now developing in Latin
America.
   ``The United States condemns the violation of constitutional
order in Suriname and calls on the Surinamese military to restore
power immediately to the democratically elected authorities of that
country.''
   Earlier this month President Bush visited South America,
emphasizing the movement away from military government and
dictatorship.
   In Paramaribo, the Surinamese capital, President Shankar and his
cabinet handed their resignations to Parliament on Friday.
Parliament was expected to name a new president and vice president
by Saturday.
   The resolution adopted by the OAS council ``appeals for the
reinstatement of the democratic institutional order and the
avoidance of any act that could aggravate the situation and impair
the full enjoyment of human rights.''

   A native of the Dominican Republic, fed up with
cold Canadian winters, has been arrested after trying to steal an
airplane and fly himself home, police say.
   Police said the 24-year-old man climbed over a fence at
Montreal's Dorval airport after dark Friday and forced his way into
an empty twin-engine plane at Avionair Inc., a charter-flight
company.
   ``He started to get something going inside the cockpit when he
was intercepted by one of the workers,'' said Det. Sgt. Kevin
McCready of the Montreal police.
   Police refused to release the name of the suspect but said he
has landed-immigrant status and has been in Canada since 1988.
   He was depressed and wanted to return to his native country,
McCready said.
   ``He said he wanted to go home. He doesn't like our winters,''
McCready said.
   The man did not have a pilot's license and McCready believed he
did not know how to fly the plane, which seats six passengers.

<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan says millions of sick, elderly or poor Americans will
suffer if proposed cuts in his budget are implemented.
   The reductions would leave Sullivan's agency unable to maintain
current services in programs like Medicare and Social Security, the
secretary said in a letter to the White House protesting the Office
of Management and Budget's proposed cuts. He said the result would
be longer processing times for claims.
   Sullivan's letter said also that the OMB proposal would provide
inadequate funds to turn more attention to prenatal care and
expansion of programs to combat lead poisoning, breast cancer,
tuberculosis and AIDS, as the department wants to do.
   The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press
on Friday, was sent last Friday night to OMB Director Richard
Darman. First word of it appeared in Friday's New York Times.
   A department budget official said that during the past week much
progress had been made in negotiations with OMB, but he declined to
give specifics. The negotiations are continuing, he said.
   The letter said that cuts in funds for administration of the
Health Care Financing Administration, which handles Medicare and
Medicaid, and the Social Security Administration could hurt ``our
ability to respond to the needs of 50 million aged and disabled
beneficiaries.''
   Kevin Moley, HHS assistant secretary for management and budget,
said that while the figure of 50 million was correct when the
letter was written a week ago, it is ``far fewer today than last
week, and we expect to resolve those issues by the time we announce
our budget.''
   Moley declined to say how much money was in dispute, and the
letter did not spell out the total.
   Sullivan's letter of appeal is part of the annual budget-making
process. After a department drafts a budget request, OMB reviews
it, makes changes and sends the resulting proposal, called a ``pass
back,'' to the department. The department then negotiates with OMB
and, if still not satisfied, may appeal to the president himself.
   It is rare that any agency head is satisfied with OMB's ``pass
back.''
   President Bush will give his budget proposal, covering the 1992
fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, 1991, to Congress in early
February.
   OMB's ``pass back'' to HHS would cut Medicare by $2.7 billion in
addition to the nearly $6 billion agreed to in the
deficit-reduction package approved by the administration and
Congress in October. The extra cuts would come from payments to
physicians and hospitals.
   The proposed cuts in administrative expenses of Social Security
would increase the backlog of telephone calls and mean more busy
signals, Sullivan's letter said.
   Sullivan said the department needs an additional $82 million
beyond what OMB would provide for efforts to get high-risk women
into prenatal care. These efforts would help reduce the United
States' high infant mortality rate and reduce costs for care of
premature infants, he said.
   Sullivan also wants $143 million beyond OMB's proposal for
programs that increase access to health care for minorities and the
disadvantaged.
   The secretary also told Darman he wants to further decrease the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to $468 million, which
has been running at about $1 billion a year in recent years, and
``target it to the Northeast states where low-income residents are
most likely to use fuel oil to heat their homes.''

<TEXT>
   A Cuban medical worker fled to a
Colombian island the day he was due to return to his homeland, a
newspaper reports. It was the fourth defection in six weeks by a
member of Cuba's volunteer medical brigades in Nicaragua.
   Barricada, official newspaper of the leftist Sandinista Front,
reported Friday that Fausto Mambes Ramirez left the Atlantic Coast
port town of Bluefields earlier this month for Corn Island, a
nearby Nicaraguan island.
   The 43-year-old anesthesiologist, traveling aboard a private
speedboat, then went to the Colombian island of San Andres, the
paper said, citing unspecified official information.
   A call to the Cuban Embassy in Managua, seeking independent
confirmation, was not immediately returned.
   Barricada said Ramirez left on Dec. 22, the day he was to return
to Cuba after completing his second stint as a volunteer medical
worker in Bluefields, 200 miles southeast of Managua.
   Despite this year's change from a leftist to a pro-U.S.
government in Nicaragua, Cuba's Communist government has continued
to send medical brigades totaling about 300 people, half of them
doctors.
   In late November, two Cuban doctors and a male nurse defected
and were allowed to travel to neighboring Costa Rica.
   The incident proved an embarrassment for the Nicaraguan
government, which doesn't want to jeopardize the aid provided by
the Cuban medical brigades.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's 10-month-old Cabinet
resigned today after intense party pressure to allow other senior
politicians to hold prestigious government posts, a top official
said.
   Kaifu's new Cabinet was to be announced this evening. Many key
ministers are expected to retain their posts and no major policy
changes were expected.
   The make-up of the new Cabinet has been the subject of intense
debate within the governing Liberal Democratic Party. Kaifu is
strongly opposed to demands by some senior party leaders to bring
back politicians who were tainted by an influence-peddling scandal
last year.
   Whether Kaifu can keep his Cabinet free of politicians linked to
the scandal, in which the Recruit job-placement conglomerate
offered lucrative unlisted stock to influential politicians, is
being viewed by analysts as a test of his political clout.
   There was no immediate official announcement of the Cabinet
reshuffle, but politicians leaving an afternoon meeting with Kaifu
indicated the resignations had been tendered.
   A top government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that all 21 Cabinet members had handed letters of
resignation to Kaifu upon his request.
   ``Nothing is going to change except faces in the Cabinet profile
book,'' said Masaya Ito, a prominent political analyst who served
as secretary to the late Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda.
   Japan's Cabinet is typically reshuffled annually to give
desirable assignments to senior lawmakers of the Liberal Democratic
Party.
   The party is comprised of five major factions, each headed by a
powerful politician who aspires to become prime minister and to win
Cabinet posts for his allies.
   Because he belongs to the smallest faction, Kaifu is regarded as
having a weak power base and needs to compromise with other faction
leaders.
   Kaifu originally had said he would not announce a change before
the new year in an effort to display some independence, but
apparently changed his mind after meeting Friday afternoon with
Ichiro Ozawa, the party's powerful secretary general.

<HEAD>Public Focused More Attention Gulf Crisis In 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans paid more attention to the Persian
Gulf crisis than to any other news story in 1990 - a year in which
domestic news reports were dominated by international events, a
survey shows.
   Two-thirds of the public closely followed stories about the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the deployment of U.S. forces in the
region over the last five months, according to the survey by the
Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press.
   But Americans showed little interest in the historic fall of
communism in almost all of Eastern Europe and the economic and
political turmoil in the Soviet Union. The survey said that at no
point did more than 30 percent of Americans closely follow these
events.
   The Mideast events also figured in the most closely followed
domestic news story of the year. Sixty-two percent of those
surveyed said they regularly read stories about soaring gasoline
prices in August and September.
   By comparison, reports in November about the declining economy
attracted only 39 percent of the readers on a regular basis.
Stories leaing up to and including the November general election
caught the regular attention of only 38 percent, as did stories
last January about the war against drugs.
   Only one other news event, also involving U.S. soldiers fighting
abroad, caught the close attention of more than a majority
Americans: Sixty percent of Americans regularly read stories about
the U.S. invasion of Panama. Although U.S. troops invaded Panama in
December, 1989, their presence in the country and numerous news
stories continued into 1990.
   According to the survey, the Times Mirror News Interest Index,
public interest in some issues shifted significantly during the
year.
   Last spring, only 18 percent of the public paid close attention
to stories about the first signs of economic problems. By September
that percentage had increased to 29 percent and in November it was
39 percent.
   There was only scant attention to the nation's budget deficit
last spring when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., proposed a deficit
reduction plan. During the summer as Congress debated a budget
package 18 percent of the readers were following the issue closely
with public attention increasing to 34 percent by the fall amid
threats to shut down the federal government.
   Interest in news concerning President Bush also fluctuated
widely during the year.
   When Bush attended the drug summit in Columbia last February,
only 22 percent of the public paid close attention to news stories
about the visit. Criticism of the president on his changing
position on taxes and his Persian Gulf policy caught the close
attention of slightly less than a third of the public.
   By contrast, three out of four people read last March about
Bush's distaste for broccoli.
   Sensational crimes and trials brought substantial public
interest during 1990.
   News about the serial killings in Gainesville, Fla., attracted
more public attention - 36 percent - than any other crime story
during the year. Twenty-eight percent of the readers followed the
drug arrest of Mayor Marion Barry of Washington D.C., but interest
waned. Only 16 percent paid close attention to stories about
Barry's conviction on some of the charges.
   Some stories attracted less public interest than expected.
   Despite the extensive coverage of the nomination of David Souter
to the U.S. Supreme Court, only about 15 percent followed the event
closely. And more than half of the people surveyed said they
strongly felt too much was written about the marital breakup of
Donald and Ivana Trump. Twelve percent of the public said they
closely followed the affair.
   Here are a few other major news events and their interest
quotient:
   -The Supreme Court decision affirming the right to burn the
flag, 24 percent.
   -The Super Bowl, 22 percent.
   -The controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr's singing of the
national anthem, 21 percent.
   -Continuing news last June about the savings and loan scandal,
18 percent.
   -The election in Nicaragua, 19 percent.
   -The death of 87 people in a first at a New York City social
club, 28 percent.
   -Political changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, 26 to
28 percent.
   Among the news stories in the survey that attracted the least
interest were: the United Nation's children's summit, 6 percent;
civil war in Cambodia, 4 percent, and actor Tom Cruise's separation
from his wife, 2 percent.
   The 1990 survey reflects monthly telephone polls of about 1,200
adults nationwide. Each monthly survey has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEAD>Parliament Opponents Of Coup Refuse To Vote For Army's Presidential
Nominee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some parliament members protesting a
military coup say they will cast blank ballots rather than take
part in voting for an army-backed president.
   The National Assembly was scheduled to vote today on the
military's proposal for Johan Kraag to assume the presidency of the
South American nation and lead an interim government that would
organize elections within 100 days.
   The army needs at least 34 votes in the 51-member National
Assembly to confirm the selection of Kraag and his proposed vice
president, Jules Wijdenbosch.
   But at least one assembly member said he and some colleagues
would cast blank ballots to protest the Christmas Eve ouster of
President Ramsewak Shankar.
   Shankar had been locked in a dispute with Desi Bouterse, who
headed a military dictatorship that ruled the former Dutch colony
from 1980-88. Bouterse is widely believed to have planned the coup.
   Kraag belongs to the National Party of Suriname, the party of
ousted Vice President Henck Arron. Wijdenbosch is chairman of the
National Democratic Party, which was organized by Bouterse.
   Shankar and his Cabinet formally submitted their resignations to
the parliament Friday. The military claims Suriname's constitution
permits military intervention as long as the National Assembly is
left intact.
   Shankar's former coalition has 40 seats in the assembly, and the
National Democratic Party has three seats.
   Cmdr. Ivan Graanoogst, acting army chief, said the new president
will set the election date and the interim government will decide
whether to allow international observers to monitor the elections.
   Bouterse met Friday with Lugo Turon, a special emissary from
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, and told him ``the army
will keep its word and there will be elections,'' an army statement
said.
   The ethnically diverse nation of 400,000 people has suffered a
progressive economic crisis since 1980.
   The Dutch government cut off aid payments after Bouterse killed
15 of his political opponents in 1982. The economy has also been
hurt by a guerrilla war and plunging world prices for bauxite, the
main export.
   In Washington, the Organization of American States denounced the
military takeover. The United States and all Latin American
representatives except Honduras also criticized it.
   Their resolution Friday ``appeals for the reinstatement of the
democratic institutional order'' in Suriname.
   Luigi Einaudi, the U.S. delegate to the OAS, said: ``We cannot
be silent about the events in Suriname that deprive the Surinamese
people of their rights. We can not allow those illegal acts to
threaten the democracy now developing in Latin America.''

<HEAD>Federal Goverment Ties Highway Funding to Stricter Drug Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California stopped telling casual marijuana
users ``smoke a joint, go to jail'' 15 years ago. But the federal
government's new version - ``smoke a joint, lose your driver's
license'' - promises to rekindle debate over the state's pot law.
   A little-noted amendment to a new federal highway funding law
seeks to use federal funding as a weapon against liberal state drug
laws. It would particularly affect California and New York because
of those states' relatively liberal marijuana laws and large
amounts of federal funding.
   The federal law calls for every state to pass a law in 1991-92
requiring a six-month driver license suspension for anyone
convicted of violating any drug law, including possession of
marijuana for personal use.
   States that refuse could lose 5 percent of their federal highway
aid in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, 1993. That would be $60
million at current levels of aid to California, said the
amendment's sponsor, Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y. The amendment
passed in July.
   New York's penalty would be an estimated $16 million, said state
Transporation Department spokesman David Ernst.
   The penalty would become 10 percent two years later.
   The penalty appears modest in light of California's $55 billion
budget. But with 1991's state deficit projected as high as $10
billion, any potential loss of revenue is a sensitive issue.
   Gov.-elect Pete Wilson has not taken a position on driver
license suspensions, but press secretary Bill Livingstone said
Wilson agrees with outgoing federal drug overseer William Bennett
that California's drug laws are too lenient.
   Wilson cannot require the Democratic-controlled Legislature to
pass a license suspension law, but his position could determine the
fiscal impact on the state. Solomon's amendment lets a state avoid
a monetary penalty only if both the Legislature and the governor
oppose the requirement of license suspensions.
   California liberalized its marijuana law in 1975. Possession of
an ounce or less, which previously could be prosecuted as a felony
with a state prison sentence, is now subject to a $100 fine, with
no jail time or permanent criminal record.
   The state requires a four-month license suspension for drunken
drivers but doesn't suspend licenses for drinking, drug use or drug
possession unrelated to driving.
   Any action by the New York state Legislature on the requirement
probably wouldn't come for several years, after the federal
government issues details of how the highway program would be run.
   ``We're aware of the law. We're waiting for the regulations to
see how to best proceed,'' said Christopher Cernik, counsel to
Assemblyman Michael Bragman, chairman of the Assembly
Transportation Committee.
   A spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, Gordon Brownell, called the mandatory license
suspension ``tantamount to a recriminalization'' and a ``federally
imposed interference with California public policy.''
   In California, the chairmen of the legislative committees that
would handle the license suspension bill both criticized the
federal law but declined to predict the state's response.
   Sen. Bill Lockyer, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said he generally favored minimal sentences for possessing small
amounts of marijuana, but was noncommittal on the license
suspension proposal.
   Assemblyman John Burton, chairman of the Assembly Public Safety
Committee, said he opposed the license suspension as unwarranted
federal interference, as well as on its merits.
   ``Driving under the influence of a drug is one thing, possessing
it is another,'' he said.

   Rebels in Rwanda say they have killed
more than 70 government soldiers in recent clashes in the northern
part of the Central African country.
   In a statement released in the Ugandan capital Friday, the
Rwandan Patriotic Front said its guerrillas inflicted the losses in
six skirmishes against government forces in the week before
Christmas.
   The statement put rebel losses at 11 dead and 37 injured.
   Referring to a recent government claim that it had killed 400
rebels, the statement said most of those slain by Rwandan soldiers
had been civilians.
   Independent casualty figures were unavailable.
   ``The truth of the matter is that after being hit by our troops,
the regime's forces turn on innocent civilians,'' the statement
said.
   The rebels, mostly members of Rwanda's Tutsi ethnic minority,
entered their homeland nearly three months ago from neighboring
Uganda, where they had been living in exile.

<HEAD>Sleuths Sniffing for Fake Perfumes also Find VapoRub</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ELIMINATES redundant ``owns'' in 3rd graf `The Nov. 22...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators looking for the counterfeiters of
several famous brands of perfumes found a more common but no less
distinctive trademark - bogus jars of Vicks Vaporub.
   Sleuths hired to track down suppliers of phony Yves Saint
Laurent and Giorgio scents discovered 10,000 fake jars of the cold
remedy in a raid on an illicit perfume laboratory.
   The Nov. 22 raid was confirmed this week by Brandt Handley,
director of marketing for Procter and Gamble, the Cincinnati-based
company that owns Richardson-Vicks Inc.
   The bogus Vaporub jars with Arabic words in addition to English
on the label were intended for sale in the Middle East, Handley
said. Valid Vaporub, made in neighboring Malaysia, has only English
and Chinese lettering for the regional market.
   The salve is sold in more than 100 countries and made in more
than a dozen legitimate plants around the world, from its
birthplace in North Carolina to factories in Mexico, India and
Australia.
   Handley said his company's trademark had been ripped off
sporadically over the past 15 years. The latest batch smelled more
like Chinese medicated oil than the distinctive mix of menthol,
camphor and eucalyptus oil.
   Responding to pressure from the United States, Singapore
tightened its copyright laws in 1987. This was an attempt to end
its reputation as one of the hubs of counterfeit goods ranging from
computer software to clothing, books, watches, perfumes and music
and video recordings.
   U.S. officials complained that the copying, often called piracy,
cost legitimate producers hundreds of millions of dollars a year in
lost revenue.
   Five years ago pirated cassettes accounted for 90 percent of all
tape sales in Singapore. Tens of millions of illicit pre-recorded
cassettes were exported each year.
   The 1984 Band Aid charity recording of ``Do They Know It's
Christmas,'' produced to aid famine victims in Ethiopia, was
pirated in Singapore two weeks after it was released in Britain.
   Singapore's role as the major world center for sham scents
peaked in 1987-88 when 800,000 bottles were exported annually, said
Jean-Louis Faure, security director of Yves Saint Laurent.
   Perfume pirates took advantage of the country's excellent
shipping facilities and duty-free status to import components
cheaply. The bottles generally came from Taiwan and essences could
be ordered from specialist companies in France and Switzerland.
   They prospered because the equipment needed could be cheaply
installed in an apartment and the penalties were relatively light.
   After pursuing the pirates for years with limited success,
manufacturers hope that a recent series of raids mark a turning
point.
   Private investigators mounted 17 raids in the last 14 months.
Two of the last three major illicit perfumeries known to be
operating were hit in November, Faure said. They found the Vaporub
in one of those raids, apparently a synthetic sideline.

<HEAD>Texas House Speaker Indicted On Misdemeanor Ethics Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas House speaker was indicted on
charges he accepted $5,000 from a law firm and didn't disclose it,
joining legislative leaders in the two other most populous states
under an ethical cloud.
   House speakers in New York and California also are under
scrutiny as they prepare for new legislative sessions. The
investigation in Texas also involves other legislators.
   A Travis County grand jury returned indictments on two
misdemeanor charges Friday against Gib Lewis, alleging he solicited
and received a gift from the San Antonio-based law firm of Heard
Goggan Blair &amp; Williams, then failed to report it.
   Despite the charges, Lewis' lawyer said the lawmaker would seek
an unprecedented fifth term as House speaker.
   ``I don't see any legal reason or otherwise why he shouldn't be
elected to the speakership,'' attorney Bill Willms said.
   The 150-member House will elect a speaker Jan. 8, the first day
of the regular legislative session.
   The first charge alleges the law firm paid part of a tax bill
Lewis owed. The second claims he failed to disclose the payment as
a gift on his public financial disclosure statement.
   The maximum penalty upon conviction of both charges is 1{ years
in jail and a $3,000 fine.
   ``Although these crimes are misdemeanors, they are among the
most serious crimes a public official can be charged with,''
prosecutor Ronnie Earle said Friday.
   Lewis, a Fort Worth Democrat, has denied any wrongdoing, and his
lawyers said he would plead innocent. Lawyer Allen Hill and other
defense attorneyes said the charges were politically motivated.
   Lewis, 54, was traveling and unavailable for comment on the
indictment, said his spokesman, Monte Williams.
   The grand jury, which will remain in session for another three
months, also is investigating an April 1987 trip to Mexico that
Lewis took with four partners in the law firm, an Austin lobbyist
and six women, one of whom reportedly was a topless dancer named
Chrissee.
   ``There are a number of allegations remaining under
investigation concerning Mr. Lewis, various members of the
Legislature and lobbyists,'' Earle said.
   Heard Goggan, one of the few law firms in Texas with contracts
to collect delinquent taxes for local governments, paid about half
of a $10,433 delinquent tax bill owed by a company partly owned by
Lewis, the indictment claims. Lewis has said the payment
represented a ``business settlement.''
   As speaker for the last eight years, Lewis has controlled the
House, assigning bills to committees, naming their chairmen and
directing floor debate.
   Earle said the indictments were issued Friday to meet the
statute of limitations on misdemeanor charges and because of the
upcoming election for House speaker.
   In the past eight years, the law firm has flourished under a
state law that allows a private firm hired by local governments to
add a 15 percent fee onto overdue tax bills.
   Numerous legislative attempts aimed at changing the law have
died in House committees.
   In New York, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller pleaded innocent Dec.
20 to federal mail fraud harges involving allegations of a real
estate scam.
   Miller, a Democrat from New York City, and top aide and former
law partner Jay Adolf were indicted on 19 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy and falsifying documents.
   The charges stem from Miller's private law practice and Miller
claims they amount to a political witch hunt.
   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown reportedly is being
investigated about allegations that he was involved in legislation
aimed at helping a regional garbage company get around local
restrictions on landfills. Brown has not been charged with any
crime and denies any impropriety.

<TEXT>
   Nancy Cruzan is ``free at last,'' her father
said at a tearful funeral amid proud reflections on the young
woman's role in the national right-to-die debate.
   Ms. Cruzan's nearly eight-year journey to death resulted in a
landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision and a 500-fold jump in
inquiries about living wills, Joe Cruzan told mourners Friday.
Living wills allow adults to specify in advance their wishes about
life-sustaining treatment.
   ``I believe that these facts speak to the legacy that Nancy left
us,'' he told more than 200 mourners. ``She did not die in vain.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, severely brain damaged in a 1983 car accident,
died Wednesday at Missouri Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon,
12 days after her feeding tube was removed.
   She was buried in Carterville Cemetery just north of Joplin.
Mourners crowded under a broad green tent to view her blue metal
casket, which was etched with flying sea gulls and decorated with
about two dozen bright floral arrangements.
   The flowers included a single red rose from Ms. Cruzan's
grandparents, a red, white and blue arrangement from her 1975 Webb
City High School graduating class and violets from the cheese plant
where she worked.
   Before the burial, 13 photographs of Ms. Cruzan were displayed
above the casket, including one of her as an infant bundled for
winter play, as a little girl wrestling with a too-tall bicycle and
as a smiling young woman.
   ``We all feel good that Nancy is free at last,'' Joe Cruzan told
reporters. ``It was time.''
   After most mourners left, he returned for a moment alone and
placed a pink flower on the grave.
   Ms. Cruzan's parents waged a long legal battle for permission to
remove the feeding tube, contending their daughter would rather die
than continue in a persistent vegetative state. But their request
was stymied because she left no written instructions about being
kept alive.
   In its first right-to-die decision, the Supreme Court ruled in
June that Missouri could require ``clear and convincing evidence''
to verify Ms. Cruzan's intentions.
   A federal judge ruled that the family did provide such evidence
and the feeding tube was removed. Ms. Cruzan died 12 days later.
   Demonstrators kept a death watch outside the hospital and made
unsuccessful pleas to Missouri and federal courts to reconnect the
feeding tube. There were no protests at the funeral or burial.

<HEAD>Weapons And Cash Found In Ershad's Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today that
investigators have seized 15 weapons, cash and luxury goods worth
over $100,000 from the home of deposed President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad.
   Police have told Ershad he is suspected of corruption and
abusing his office, but formal charges have not been filed.
   Ittefaq, a Bengali-language daily, quoted an unidentified source
close to the investigating team as saying seven shotguns, six
pistols and two revolvers were found in Ershad's official residence
located in a complex of military barracks and officers' homes.
   All the weapons except for three handguns were unlicensed, the
paper said, quoting the source.
   The team comprising a magistrate, police and army officials
examined Ershad's property after the former army general was
escorted from his house Dec. 12 and placed under house arrest in an
exclusive suburb.
   Ershad resigned Dec. 6, yielding to 7-week-long mass protests
against his government.
   Ittefaq said the list of seized property is still incomplete.
But it said $60,000 in cash was found along with 30 trunks of gold
ornaments, crystal and luxury items which may push the value beyond
$100,000.
   ``The investigating team has found certain illegal items which
should not have been at an official residence of a president,'' the
paper said, without saying what they were.
   The list will be handed over to a government-appointed
commission investigating the suspicions against Ershad, who ruled
Bangladesh for more than eight years.
   The caretaker government which replaced Ershad also has arrested
four former officials, including ex-Vice President Moudud Ahmed,
and is seeking 14 more officials of the ousted regime.

<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 56-year-old Swedish woman, one of
several Western peace activists aboard an Iraqi ship intercepted in
the Arabian Sea, has been airlifted to a hospital by a U.S. Navy
helicopter, a U.S. spokesman reported today.
   The Iraqi captain of the 11,000-ton Ibn Khaldoon, forced to
anchor off the coast of Oman on Wednesday, radioed for help around
midnight Thursday, the spokesman said.
   The woman was reported to be suffering ``chest pains and
gastrointestinal distress'' and a medical officer from the
amphibious transport dock USS Trenton was sent aboard to examine
her, the spokesman said.
   Later, a helicopter from the assault carrier Iwo Jima flew the
unidentified woman to the warship for further checks.
   She was transferred to a shore hospital Friday, the spokesman
said, without disclosing which medical center. Her current
condition was not immediately known.
   The Ibn Khaldoon was stopped Wednesday by Western warships in
the nothern Arabian Sea outside the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to
the Persian Gulf.
   They were enforcing the United Nations economic embargo on Iraq
for invading Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Boarding parties found the ship, which was heading for Iraq's
southern port of Umm Qasr, was carrying 800 tons of sugar as well
as cooking oil and rice, all banned under the embargo.
   The Ibn Khaldoon was also carrying scores of peace activists
from Arab, Asian and Western countries who were heading for Iraq in
a demonstration of support for President Saddam Hussein.
   Iraq's media said the activists included American, Japanese,
Chinese and European peace campaigners.
   The women tried to resist the boarding teams. U.S. officials
said there were no injuries in the scuffles.
   But the Iraqi media claimed the Western sailors beat the
passengers with clubs and rifle butts, causing some injuries.
   The U.S. Navy said there were 161 women, 66 men and 14 children
on the ship, including the 42-man crew, when it was boarded.
   They will be allowed to continue the voyage to Iraq once the
cargo has been unloaded, officials said.
   The U.S. spokesman said the so-called ``peace ship'' was
anchored off the Omani island of Masirah while the captain awaited
the outcome of diplomatic contacts deciding at what port he could
discharge his cargo.
   The Trenton and other warships of the U.S.-led multinational
armada in the region maintained a watch over the Ibn Khaldoon.

<TEXT>
   Japan's largest consumer electronics company
won two legal victories to clear the way for the expected
completion today of its landmark $6.6 billion purchase of
entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc.
   Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co.'s takeover of MCA would be
the largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. company. It would resemble
the buyout by Japan's Sony Corp. of Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. for $5 billion a year ago.
   The merger would give Matsushita, familiar to American consumers
through brand names such as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar, the
entertainment ``software'' it needs to complement its electronics
``hardware.''
   MCA, owner of Universal Studios, has grown into a colossus of
films (``E.T. the Extra-Terrestial,'' ``Jaws,'' ``Back to the
Future''), as well as records (Reba McEntire, Elton John, Guns N'
Roses) and television (``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Major Dad''). It
also owns theme parks in Florida and California.
   Matsushita officials worked through the night to complete the
$66-a-share tender offer for MCA today, Matsushita spokeswoman
Joele Frank said from New York.
   ``The tender offer is currently scheduled to come down, but
until it's done I can't say anything,'' Frank said by telephone
early today. She said the company would not release details until
Sunday.
   On Friday, a federal judge in Los Angeles refused a bid by
several MCA shareholders to block the sale. They alleged that MCA
chairman Lew Wasserman violated Securities and Exchange Commission
rules by receiving tax-free stock transfers as part of Matsushita's
tender offer for MCA's stock.
   While not dismissing the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Manuel
Real said there was insufficient evidence presented to block the
transaction.
   In a separate case, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
denied a last-minute motion in a lawsuit by Go-Video Inc. to stop
the sale. The Arizona manufacturer of dual-deck VCRs alleged the
deal would violate antitrust rules.
   Matsushita, one of the world's largest corporations with $38
billion in sales recorded last fiscal year, would become the
majority shareholder of MCA, but would not assume ownership of the
company until early next year.
   Ernest Kaufmann, an attorney for the objecting MCA shareholders,
said his clients would continue pursuing the class-action lawsuit
seeking unspecified cash damages.
   As part of the MCA buyout, Wasserman alone is to receive a new
preferred Matsushita stock designed to save him $100 million in
capital gains taxes and additional estate taxes.
   ``Our shareholders, on the other hand, are facing enormous tax
problems,'' Kaufmann said.
   Matsushita is issuing preferred stock worth $330 million to
Wasserman in return for Wasserman's 4.95 million shares of MCA
stock. The stock, in a new Matsushita subsidiary, pays an annual
dividend of 8.75 percent.
   In an earlier interview, Wasserman defended the unusual stock
plan.
   Asked if he would enjoy an unfair tax advantage over other MCA
shareholders, Wasserman said, ``Well, is that against the law?''

   The parliament speaker ducked out under a
barrage of fruit, wastepaper baskets and tea cups after passage of
a clemency bill ignited the latest scuffle among lawmakers.
   Police with shields protected Speaker Liang Su-jung, who fled
the hall as opposition Democratic Progressive Party politicians
tangled with Nationalist Party colleagues, many in their 80s or
older, witnessess said.
   No one was seriously hurt in the 10-minute skirmish late Friday,
but Democratic Progressive lawmaker Hsieh Chang-tien suffered a
bloody nose and dozens of other legislators' suits were stained
with tea, officials reported.
   They were elected in China before 1949, when the Nationalists
lost a civil war to Communists and retreated to Taiwan.
   Fights have been common among the 243 members of the lawmaking
body, or Yuan, since opposition parties were legalized last year.
The Nationalist Party holds 215 seats and the Democratic
Progressive Party has 13.
   The latest brawl began when Democratic Progressive lawmakers
organized a filibuster of a clemency bill, seeking to force an
amendment to reduce the jail sentences of dozens of its supporters
convicted of beating policemen in demonstrations. Nationalists
opposed the change.
   Pandemonium erupted when Liang announced that 77 of the 84
legislators present voted to override the filibuster and passed the
bill.
   The seven Democratic Progressive legislators refrained from
voting, and they immediately began tossing wastepaper baskets and
punching those who tried to calm them.
   During the voting, Democratic Progressive legislators lobbed
fruit and cups of tea at Nationalist members to distract them.
Fruit is regularly supplied to legislators attending lengthy
sessions.
   Democratic Progressive legislator Tai Chen-yao tossed Liang's
chair down from the podium to protest his departure.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Accuse Kellogg Of Deceptive Cereal Claims</HEAD>

   Tony the Tiger says Frosted Flakes are grrrreat, but attorneys
general from five states claim he isn't telling the full story.
   The officials allege Kellogg Co. used deceptive and misleading
health claims about Frosted Flakes and two other cereals. A company
spokesman denied the accusations.
   In documents filed Friday in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa,
the attorneys general responded to Kellogg's claims made in a
lawsuit filed in August against the Iowa attorney general and
secretary of agriculture.
   The lawsuit and counterclaims stem from an investigation into
Kellogg's advertising that began two years ago.
   The officials from Minnesota, California, Florida, Texas and
Wisconsin also made several counterclaims, among them that
Kellogg's lacks ``reasonable substantiation'' for claiming Frosted
Flakes is a healthy snack food superior to some fruits. Television
commercials for the cereal feature the cartoon character Tony the
Tiger.
   Regarding Special K, the officials said Kellogg's misrepresented
the cereal's benefit by saying those who eat it can ``keep the
muscle, lose the fat.''
   They said such representation failed to disclose that ``for the
vast majority of consumers and even for those on a diet, eating one
serving of Special K would have virtually no effect on preventing
the loss of muscle as the majority of dieters are in no danger of
losing muscle, and for those who are, a serving of Special K would
be insignificant...''
   Kellogg's claim that a cereal formerly named 40&plus; Bran Flakes had
a particular benefit because it contained the ``maximum amount of
fiber plus iron'' for people over 40 failed to say the cereal was
not formulated particularly for people over 40, the officials said.
In addition, there was no proof that people over 40 needed the
ingredients contained in the cereal more than younger people, they
said.
   Kellogg no longer markets its bran flake cereal under the 40&plus;
name.
   Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president for corporate
affairs, said the company, based in Battle Creek, Mich., stands
behind its advertising.
   ``The federal authority over advertising exists and these
individuals are attempting now to regulate advertisements
state-by-state,'' he said.
   Kellogg has promoted Special K as a high protein cereal for more
than 35 years, he said, and claims the cereal can help retain
muscle while losing fat when eaten as part of a regimen that
includes exercise.
   Frosted Flakes has 11 grams of sugar while an apple, for
example, has 14 grams of sugar, Stewart said.
   He said Kellogg officials at first sought to negotiate with Iowa
officials, but now contend the accusations amount to harassment.

   A man headed for a liquor store was
unharmed but had a soot-blackened face after a commuter train ran
over him.
   ``I was on my way to the liquor store to buy a bottle of vodka.
I looked up and all I saw was a headlight headed my way,'' Anselmo
Castillo Campos, 35, said from jail where he was taken for
investigation of public drunkenness. ``All I could do was lay down
in the middle of the tracks.''
   Santa Clara Police officer Floyd Worley, who arrested the
5-foot-2, 135-pound Campos after the Thursday afternoon accident,
said it was a miracle Campos survived the brush with the three-car
CalTrain commuter express, which was going about 20 mph.
   ``I'd like to get his five luckiest numbers for the lottery,''
Worley said.
   The train, on its way to San Francisco, was delayed 25 minutes
while paramedics and police examined Campos, who smiled and waved
to bystanders.

<HEAD>Somalia Appeals For Public Support Against Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a growing wave of violence and
unrest, Somalia has appealed for public support for a crackdown on
various armed gangs and rebels bent on overthrowing the government
of President Mohamed Siad Barre.
   The appeal for public support by Information Minister Umar
Muhammad Abd Al-Rahman came late Friday after a government
announcement of new clashes between security forces and armed gangs
Thursday.
   The government said two gunmen were killed and more than 20
arrested in the shootout in a shantytown on the northern outskirts
of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.
   But unofficial reports reaching Nairobi, the capital of
neighboring Kenya, spoke of many more deaths and hundreds of
arrests by security forces in the Somali capital.
   In a broadcast monitored in Nairobi, Somali National Radio said
Al-Rahman appealed to the people of the country to collaborate with
the security forces.
   ``The minister appealed to the Somali masses to show their
allegiance by collaborating with the forces engaged in maintaining
the country's security and stability,'' the radio said.
   It was not clear whether security forces were battling lawless
elements or rebels in Mogadishu. The government has long used the
term ``bandits'' to describe armed rebels.
   Siad Barre's government has lost ground in recent months to
separate rebel groups in the north, center and south of the
elbow-shaped nation. His grip on the capital also appears to be
slipping.
   The United Somali Congress, the insurgency fighting in the
center of the country, is reported by Western diplomats and others
to be within 30 miles of the capital.
   The Somali National Movement, which began the uprising against
Barre's rule two years ago, occupies much of the northern part of
the nation.
   A smaller rebel group, the Somali Patriotic Movement, has tied
up government troops with scattered raids in the south.
   The United States and most other Western nations withdrew all
but essential embassy personnel from Mogadishu two weeks ago and
urged their nationals to leave the Horn of Africa country.

   A Revolutionary Communist Party member was
sentenced to a year in prison for inciting violence after burning
an American flag to protest U.S. military action in the Persian
Gulf.
   Cheryl Lessin, 46, of Cleveland, wore a ``Mao (Tse Tung) more
than ever'' T-shirt at her sentencing Friday before Cuyahoga County
Common Pleas Judge Patricia Cleary. She plans to appeal.
   ``I'm being sentenced for daring to be among the first to call
out and resist their war movement and for being bold enough to burn
their symbol, their flag, despised by oppressed people here and all
across the planet,'' Ms. Lessin told the judge.
   Several of Ms. Lessin's supporters chanted, ``Stop the U.S. war
machine no matter what it takes,'' as they left the court building.
Others wore tape over their mouths, suggesting the defendant's
right to free speech had been violated.
   Her lawyers said they would request bond while her case was
appealed.
   A jury in October convicted Ms. Lessin of inciting violence
after she burned the flag during an Aug. 10 protest.
   The rally in the downtown Public Square escalated into scuffling
and yelling and two police officers testified that Ms. Lessin ran
through the crowd throwing punches and shouting obscenities.
   Ms. Lessin and other witnesses disputed that account.
   Her lawyers said the judge should have told the jury that
flag-burning is a protected form of free speech. The lawyers also
said prosecutors incorrectly used a state law against inciting
violence.

   The weekend arrived cold, wet and miserable for most of the
United States today, with snow falling in Iowa, Colorado,
Minnesota, South Dakota and Idaho, and rain hitting much of the
rest of the Midwest and East.
   Forecasters said the wind chill factor could drop to 80 below in
parts of South Dakota today, with conditions nearly as bad in North
Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.
   Heavy winds were forecast for the Sierra Nevada and California's
Mojave Desert, with more frost expected to threaten citrus crops in
California and Arizona tonight.
   Although rain fell on most of the Mid-Atlantic states, high
temperatures were expected to rise to the 40s and 50s, as much as
20 degrees over Friday, as a warm air system collided with a cold
front.
   The South, the only region to escape the storm system, had
temperatures in the 70s and 80s.
   Elsewhere, highs ranged from zero or lower along the Canadian
border states to the teens and 20s across most of the Midwest, the
teens and 20s in the Northwest and the 40s in California.
   High temperature for the nation Friday was 88 degrees at Naples,
Fla.

   A judge has barred the Southland Corp. from
contacting bondholders by phone to lobby them to support a
bankruptcy reorganization plan that would give control of the
convenience store chain to Japanese investors.
   ``This court isn't in the direct sales or siding business where
we call people on the phone,'' U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Harold
Abramson said Friday.
   Southland, parent of the 7-11 convenience stores, filed for
Chapter 11 protection in October and reported more than half of its
bondholders approved the financial reorganization plan.
   But Abramson called for another vote after dissident bondholders
complained. He also ruled that when ballots for the second vote are
mailed the dissidents may include a letter arguing against the
proposed reorganization.
   Under terms of the proposal, Ito-Yokado Co. and Seven-Eleven
Japan would invest $430 million in Southland in exchange for 70
percent ownership. The Japanese investors' offer has a March 15
deadline.
   The dissident bondholders, primarily wealthy individuals, hope
to get a sweetened offer from Southland, said their attorney, Peter
Wolfson.
   Southland is confident it will win approval of the plan again,
said company spokeswoman Cecelia Norwood.

   Hundreds of American Indians gathered
in frigid weather to commemorate today's centennial of one of the
saddest days in their history - the Wounded Knee massacre.
   The Indians, traveling by foot and horseback, arrived Friday at
the site where hundreds of Sioux, including Chief Big Foot, were
slain by U.S. cavalry soldiers on Dec. 29, 1890, in the last major
engagement between American Indians and U.S. troops.
   Tribal leaders, Gov. George Mickelson and Hawaii Sen. Daniel
Inouye, who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs,
were among those scheduled to participate in commemorative
ceremonies.
   The band of riders left two weeks ago on a 220-mile journey
retracing the path taken by Big Foot and his fellow Sioux, as they
headed toward the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwest South
Dakota.
   ``One hundred years ago, this was the last day Big Foot was
free,'' said Alex White Plume, who helped coordinate the ride.
``They didn't know they were going to bloodshed, but today we know
what happened.''
   Also riding with the group was former American Indian Movement
leader Russell Means, who helped lead an armed takeover of Wounded
Knee in 1973 to protest treatment of Indians. He said his return to
the area he and other protesters held for 71 days filled him with
pride.
   ``Wounded Knee proved to Indian people that it's all right to
stand up and be an Indian, and that it's even worth fighting for,''
he said.
   Two people were killed and several wounded in the takeover,
which divided the Sioux nation. Indictments against Means and 115
others eventually were dismissed.
   After Sioux leader Sitting Bull was killed, Big Foot led a band
of Sioux in December 1890 from central South Dakota toward the Pine
Ridge reservation.
   Accounts vary as to who fired first at Wounded Knee, but scores
of Sioux men, women and children were killed. Federal officials put
the figure at about 150, while Sioux officials say as many as 400
died.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is deliberating its political
ties to Cuba and preparing to drastically cut aid next month, while
its longtime ally in the Caribbean is bracing for the worst.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro on Friday spoke of impending
dismissals of Communist Party officials during a parliamentary
session on ways to restructure the island nation's political and
economic system, the Havana-based official news agency Prensa
Latina reported.
   ``Castro expressed that the Central Committee had reached
excessive levels of personnel,'' said an agency dispatch monitored
in Mexico City.
   It said the party personnel must be transferred to farm work and
construction to meet Cuba's needs in the face of economic crisis.
   Soviet economic aid to Cuba hovers at $5 billion a year, and
military aid is near the $1.5 billion mark, according to Western
estimates. But economic hard times in the Soviet Union are expected
to mean an aid reduction decision during January trade talks.
   The Kremlin maintains it will stand by Castro politically. But
Castro's unflagging rejection of Soviet-style reform may influence
the national Supreme Soviet legislature when it comes to debating a
foreign aid bill.
   ``If they (Cubans) continue the so-called `old course,' we'll
let them continue. But foreign aid won't be as it was before,''
said Nikolai V. Neyland, a member of the Supreme Soviet's Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   Prensa Latina quoted Castro as saying that two-thirds of the
Cuban Communist Party's officials were recently cut from the ranks
and reported that parliament president Juan Escalona invited
lawmakers' suggestions on how to trim away moreof them.
   ``The goal is to propose to the Cuban Communist Party's 4th
congress how municipal governments should be structured and how
many people can function efficiently,'' Escalona said.
   The scheduling of the congress, expected to result in
constitutional reform sometime in the first half of 1991, is seen
as an indication that Cuba needs to adjust its political
trajectory.
   Castro has given a cold shoulder to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political reforms, undertaken in 1985.
   In turn, Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' on foreign affairs led him
to state during a 1989 visit to Cuba that he opposes Castro's
support for Communist revolutions in countries such as El Salvador,
Angola and Nicaragua.
   The Soviets are also promoting a thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations, a
31-year antagonism that nearly led to nuclear war over the 1962
Cuban missile crisis.
   However, the official reason for cutting Soviet aid to Cuba is
financial.
   Gorbachev's foreign aid bill proposes a 75 percent cut in
``gratuitous'' foreign economic aid, apparently for all Soviet
allies.
   It envisions a new policy, starting Jan. 1, requiring allies to
pay convertible currency at world prices for most trade with the
Soviet Union.
   That would mean the end of favorable trade terms to Cuba as well
as Vietnam, North Korea, Ethiopia and other countries.
   Meanwhile, more than 100,000 supporters of the Communist Youth
Guild held a rally in Havana Friday in support of Castro, Prensa
Latina said. Castro's Cuban revolution marks its 32nd anniversary
on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dentist in AIDS Case Accused of Using False Names</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dentist gave a false name and
occupation to doctors treating him for AIDS, contends a lawyer for
a woman who says she contracted the deadly disease from him during
dental surgery.
   Attorney David Eaton, who represents 22-year-old Kimberly
Bergalis, made the allegation Friday during a hearing in her suit
against CIGNA Dental Health of Florida Inc.
   The insurer put the late Dr. David Acer on its list of preferred
dentists to be used by the company's clients. Bergalis claims Acer
transmitted the disease to her during a September 1987 visit in
which he removed two of her wisdom teeth.
   ``One defense being raised is that Acer was told he could
continue treating patients,'' Eaton said.
   But Eaton said Acer, who died Sept. 1, didn't even tell the
doctors treating him his real name.
   ``He said he was David Johnson, a real estate developer, so
there's no way a doctor could have told him it was OK to continue
treating patients,'' Eaton said.
   The dentist died two days after he wrote a letter to former
patients urging them to be tested for AIDS, but expressing doubts
they could have caught the disease from him.
   ``I consulted medical experts on whether I should continue
practicing dentistry,'' Acer said in the letter. ``The experts
advised me that as long as I followed the guidelines promulgated by
the Center for Disease Control ... that I could safely continue to
practice as a dentist and that I would not infect my patients.''
   Continental National America Insurance Co. carried Acer's $1
million dental malpractice policy, which is the only asset of
Acer's estate.
   Attorneys for both sides were in St. Lucie County Circuit Court
on Friday for a hearing on whether Bergalis' attorneys are entitled
to examine Acer's medical records from the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Miami.
   Attorney Dennis Vandenberg, representing CNA, said Acer's
parents don't want their son's family history and names of social
contacts turned over to Eaton.
   Circuit Judge Robert Makemson gave the VA until Jan. 11 to turn
over all medical records, including Acer's family and social
history.

<TEXT>
   A leader of a tourism boycott says the sending of a
2-year-old proclamation to Nelson Mandela fails to make up for what
protesters see as a snub of the South African anti-apartheid
leader.
   Metro-Dade Mayor Steve Clark sent a proclamation designating
June 26, 1988, Nelson Mandela Day. Clark uncovered the little-known
proclamation last weekend.
   Organizers of the 5-month-old tourism boycott want Metro-Dade,
Miami Beach and Miami to each award Mandela a proclamation and keys
to the city - honors denied him during his visit last June.
   ``Since your visit to Miami Beach last June,'' Clark wrote
Mandela on Thursday, ``controversy and misunderstanding have
developed over the lack of recognition given you by our local
officials.''
   The 2-year-old proclamation shows that ``the fight which you
have waged for almost a quarter of a century in opposing the
policies of apartheid in South Africa long has been recognized by
myself and the people of Metropolitan Dade County,'' he said.
   Boycott organizer H.T. Smith said the action doesn't go far
enough. ``The wrong occurred in 1990, and anything that happened
before that does not redress the wrong done in 1990,'' Smith said.
``Because your boss gave you a raise in 1988 dos not at all make
up for him unfairly snubbing you in 1990.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov remained in
serious but stable condition after a heart attack earlier this
week, the official Tass news agency reported today.
   Tass quoted an unidentified Health Ministry official as saying
Ryzhkov's condition was not deteriorating, though the report did
not specify when the official was interviewed. The prime minister
suffered the heart attack Tuesday night.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Central Clinical Hospital
on Friday, talked to Ryzhkov's doctors and asked them to pass on
his wishes for a speedy recovery, Tass said. Ryzhkov was not yet
allowed to receive visitors.
   Ryzhkov experienced the heart attack the same day lawmakers
voted to eliminate the Council of Ministers he heads. The Congress
of People's Deputies voted to replace it with a new Cabinet under
Gorbachev's direct control.
   It was unclear what role if any Ryzhkov might have in the
revamped system.

   Money left to a right-to-die foundation
will be used to market a 30-minute videotape on which a woman who
committed suicide discusses her choice, the organization's
administrator said.
   Lilian Stevens, who killed herself last July at age 84 while in
failing health, bequeathed $32,000 to the My Choice organization
she helped found.
   ``Mrs. Stevens and I think many people in this country have come
to see the right to die as really a pro-choice issue, that a person
should have the right to make this most personal decision,'' the
Rev. John Brooke, a United Church of Christ minister and
administrator for My Choice, said Friday.
   In the videotape, based on several hours of conversation with
Brooke on Nov. 2, 1989, Stevens explained why she thought active
euthanasia should be legal, said Brooke.
   The videotape, called ``Pro-Choice: From Womb to Tomb,'' also
includes information on how to obtain a ``durable power of attorney
for health care'' form, living will and other documents.
   The videotape also addresses arguments against the pro-choice
philosophy, Brooke said.
   ``We talked about the danger of unscrupulous people misusing
such a procedure if it were to be legalized,'' he said.
   Stevens was in failing health when she checked into a Monterey
hotel and killed herself with pills and alcohol.

   A newspaper reporter has been subpoenaed to
testify about a jail-house interview conducted with a woman accused
of shooting her husband to death.
   The Dayton Daily News requested Friday that the subpoena be
thrown out. The newspaper cited the ``critical need to protect the
news-gathering process from compelled disclosure.''
   The subpoena was issued by Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge
William MacMillan Jr.
   County Prosecutor Lee C. Falke also wants Dayton Daily News
reporter Dwayne Bray to reveal the contents of notes he took during
an interview with Joyce Anaga.
   In a story published Dec. 21 in the Daily News, Mrs. Anaga, 42,
said her husband had abused her and that she shot him while they
were struggling over a shotgun. She said she planned to plead
self-defense under a new Ohio law for battered women. She goes on
trial next week before MacMillan.
   Prosecutors said they want to see all of Mrs. Anaga's comments
to Bray.
   ``If she takes the stand and gives a different story, then it
would be very important to know if she said something different ...
'' Falke said.
   Falke said there are precedents in Ohio courts that allow him to
subpoena a reporter to answer questions about an interview.
   The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in June that a subpoena may be
enforced ``over a reporter's claim of privilege, so long as it is
persuaded that the subpoena has been requested or issued for a
legitimate purpose, rather than for harassment.''

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's foreign minister today
launched a new mediation effort in the Persian Gulf crisis on
behalf of the 102-nation non-aligned movement.
   The move by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar, who
arrived in Baghdad Friday night, came 17 days away from the U.N.
deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait or risk attack by the
growing U.S.-led multinational force.
   Yugoslav diplomats said Loncar conferred today with Iraq's
foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, and was to meet President Saddam
Hussein later in the day.
   Also today, the government denied reports of secret contacts
with Washington, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Belousov
left Baghdad after a four-day visit.
   Loncar's trip signaled an effort by the non-aligned movement to
negotiate a settlement as the pressure on Saddam to relinquish the
conquered emirate, now designated Iraq's 19th province, mounts
daily.
   Yugoslavia is the current chairman of the group, which includes
Kuwait and Iraq.
   The Yugoslav diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
declined to comment on reports that Loncar will discuss with Saddam
details of a non-aligned peace initiative.
   Loncar last month visited Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Syria
and Jordan for talks on the crisis.
   Aziz said before beginning discussions with Loncar that there
has been no breakthrough in the stalemate over fixing a date for a
proposed visit to Baghdad by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``No progress has so far been made on this issue,'' he told
reporters.
   Both sides accuse the other of stalling. Saddam has said he is
prepared for ``serious and constructive dialogue'' with the
Americans, but diplomats see little sign of any meaningful talks
between Washington and Baghdad.
   Iraq's information minister, Latif Nussayif Jassim, today denied
reports of secret talks after Radio Monte Carlo quoted unidentified
diplomatic sources in Cairo as saying Iraq was considering some
ideas proposed by Washington.
   The radio said these include an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in
exchange for assuarnces that it will not be attacked by the
multinational force that is expected to total more than half a
million personnel by the end of January.
   ``These are ridiculous ideas and figments of the imagination,''
the official Iraqi News Agency quoted Jassim as saying.
   He reiterated the Iraqi position that there will be no pullout
from Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2. A U.N. Security Council
resolution authorizes the use of force if Iraq does not withdraw by
Jan. 15.
   The Iraqis appear adamant that any negotiations must include
linkage between an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait with an Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab territory designed a Palestinian
homeland.
   President Bush is equally adamant that there is no linkage.
   Belousov, the Soviet envoy, met Saddam Thursday. But no details
of their talks have been released.
   In an interview with the semi-official al-Jomhuriya daily today,
Belousov said they ``covered bilateral relations and issues of
mutual interest, specially those related to the gulf crisis.''
   Moscow has made repeated diplomatic efforts since the invasion
to avert the threat of war. There was no indication whether
Belousov's visit had any positive effect in this regard.
   Belousov told al-Jomhuriya that the majority of Soviet contract
workers left in Iraq will leave before Jan. 10.
   Most of the 10,000 Soviet citizens who were stranded in Iraq at
the outbreak of the crisis have already left.
   The Soviet embassy said 160 Soviets, employed mainly in oil and
power installations, will be staying on.
   Amid the apparently faltering diplomatic campaign, the Iraqis
stepped up preparations for war, with reports that special commando
squads are being trained for behind-the-lines suicide attacks on
American forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Al-Jomhuriya told Iraq's 17 million people today, particularly
those in Baghdad and other cities, to be prepared for mock air raid
warnings to test civil defense drills. Baghdad already staged mock
drills this month.
   In another development that underlined Baghdad's isolation, the
Iraqi News Agency reported that all Iraqi employees of the Arab
League, including its Deputy Under-Secretary, Salah al-Moukhtar,
have resigned in protest over the transfer of the league's
headquarters to Cairo from Tunis.
   The transfer was approved by the majority of league members,
including Egypt, which have denounced the invasion of Kuwait and
which have joined the multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
   The headquarters was moved from Cairo in 1979, when Egypt's
membership of the league was suspended because of its peace treaty
with Israel. Egypt was allowed back into the Arab fold last year.

<HEAD>Thirteen Die in Renewed Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen people died in
scattered nationwide violence following a Christmas lull, police
said today.
   Four of those killed were victims of black factional fighting in
eastern Natal Province, where more than 5,000 blacks have died in
clashes in the past five years.
   The Inkatha Freedom Party, meanwhile, criticized plans by the
rival African National Congress to intensify a mass action
anti-apartheid campaign in Natal.
   A police unrest report distributed by the independent South
African Press Association said 11 of the deaths occurred in Natal,
the power base of Inkatha. The report, which covered the previous
24 hours, provided few details.
   Four people were killed and 11 houses set on fire near Greytown
in what police described as a factional fight, which usually
involves Inkatha supporters against blacks loyal to the ANC. The
report said three of the victims were shot to death.
   Another four people died of stab wounds near Port Shepstone, the
police report said. It provided no further information.
   The burned body of a black man was found near Port Shepstone,
and two bodies with stab wounds were found near Creighton in Natal,
the report said.
   Two people died when police fended off a stone-throwing mob by
firing tear gas, service pistols and shotguns near Koster, 60 miles
northwest of Johannesburg, the police report said.
   It said a police vehicle was damaged and one officer injured in
the stoning.
   Inkatha and the ANC have been feuding for years over methods of
fighting the apartheid system of racial segregation and white
dominance. Inkatha is dominated by Zulus, and the ANC's main
supporters are Xhosas.
   An Inkatha statement late Friday protested ANC plans for
increased demonstrations, strikes and other mass action in Natal
beginning Jan. 13.
   ``All their so-called mass actions have been organized on
intimidation and coercion of people,'' the statement said. ``We in
the Inkatha Freedom Party wish to warn the ANC that their program
is a recipe for conflict, not peace.''
   President F.W. de Klerk has pledged to eliminate apartheid and
negotiate a new constitution that would give blacks political
power.
   The white-led government and the ANC, the largest opposition
group, have held talks aimed at setting up the constitutional
negotiations.
   But chronic violence, usually vicious street fighting between
ANC and Inkatha supporters, has strained the talks. The violence
spread from Natal to Johannesburg-area black townships in August,
an another 1,000 people have been killed since.
   The ANC blames Inkatha for the factional fighting, alleging
Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi wants to broaden his power base
beyond Natal, the traditional Zulu homeland.
   Inkatha accuses the ANC of trying to dominate the black
opposition movement.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today revamped his
Cabinet, replacing his justice minister who drew fire for insulting
American blacks. However, the departing justice minister received a
powerful party post.
   Kaifu's 10-month-old Cabinet resigned earlier in the day under
intense party pressure to allow other senior politicians in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party to obtain prestigious government
posts.
   But Kaifu scored a partial victory over powerful party kingpins
by keeping out some scandal-tainted politicians.
   No major policy changes were expected, although both the
minister of international trade and industry, Kabun Muto, and
Agriculture Minister Tomio Yamamoto were replaced. The move could
affect trade negotiations with the United States and other
countries.
   Seventeen new members were named in the 21-member Cabinet. It
was Kaifu's third Cabinet reshuffle since he rose from being a
member of a weak party faction to prime minister in August 1989.
   The prime minister, however, succeeded in retaining principal
Cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji
Sakamoto.
   ``Japan is facing mounting problems and we needed to maintain
our continuity,'' Sakamoto, the principal government spokesman,
told reporters. He cited Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
scheduled visit in April, the Persian Gulf crisis and strains in
relations over trade.
   Prior to the Cabinet reshuffle, Kaifu's public ratings had been
declining on charges of indecisiveness in responding to the gulf
crisis. But the key question for Kaifu had been whether he
possessed the clout to resist demands by senior party leaders to
bring back politicians tainted by the Recruit influence-peddling
scandal last year.
   The Recruit job-placement conglomerate had offered lucrative
unlisted stock to influential politicians. Kaifu was named prime
minister mostly because his ``Mr. Clean'' image positioned him as a
compromise replacement for those affected by the scandal.
   None of the new Cabinet members had been connected with the
Recruit scandal.
   Among those who will not be back is embattled Justice Minister
Seiroku Kajiyama, who again apologized for making racist remarks
about American blacks that stirred outrage in the United States and
other countries this fall.
   After touring a red-light district in Tokyo on Sept. 20,
Kajiyama had compared foreign prostitutes in Japan to American
blacks, saying they ``ruin the atmosphere of the neighborhoods they
move into.''
   ``I feel relieved now that I quit my post,'' Kajiyama said.
However, shortly after resigning, he was appointed chairman of the
Liberal Democratic Party's legislative affairs committee, an
important post.
   The annual rotation of Cabinet posts has become a party
tradition because lawmakers expect to assume a ministerial position
after serving five or six terms in Parliament.
   Kaifu earlier said he would not announce a Cabinet change before
Jan. 1 in an effort to display independence, but apparently changed
his mind under pressure from party leaders.
   The governing party is comprised of five major factions, each
headed by a powerful politician who aspires to become prime
minister and to win Cabinet posts for his allies.
   Among the key new Cabinet members is the minister of
international trade and industry, Eiichi Nakao, 60, an eight-term
lawmaker who formerly served as director-general of the Economic
Planning Agency.
   The new agriculture minister is Motoji Kondo, 60, a five-term
lawmaker in his first Cabinet post.

   At age 17, Robin the Holstein has
lasted more than four times as long as most dairy cows. Now that
she's finally retiring, her grateful owners wouldn't think of
slaughtering her.
   ``She's a nice old cow. We're real proud of her,'' said owner
Duane Hill. ``I'm going to let her die here on the farm and bury
her in the front yard. We'll probably put a flower garden over
her.''
   Dairy cows are often slaughtered at age 4, Hill said, after
being subjected to regimens under which they're quickly ``used
up.''
   But Robin has produced 35,000 gallons - or six tankers - of milk
in a long career. Of the 65,000 dairy cows in Indiana whose
production is monitored through the Dairy Herd Improvement
Association, only one other living cow has equaled Robin's output,
Hill said.
   But now Robin's getting old and producing only about 2 gallons a
day. The cow bore her 13th calf last April and Hill said he won't
try to breed her again.
   ``She's got a lot of gray in her hair. Her joints pop and crack
and she's thin. It's taking all she can eat to take care of
herself,'' he said
   Robin's offspring also proved good milk producers, earning Robin
a Gold Medal Dam award from the National Holstein Association.
   Hill and his wife, Joyce Ann, milk 50 cows twice a day. They
name all their cows and recognize their individual personalities.
   ``They're part of the family,'' Hill said.

<HEAD>December To Be Record Month For Immigration; Housing Crisis
Deepens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli officials say December will be a record
month for immigration, setting off new debate on how to tackle the
deepening housing crisis.
   About 40,00 newcomers are expected, most of them Soviet Jews.
   Some officials are urging the government take a greater role in
housing construction. Others are calling for such stopgap measures
as creating tent cities or putting newcomers in trailers atop
buildings or in bomb shelters.
   December will be ``a record month in the history of immigration
in Israel,'' Simcha Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish
Agency, told a news conference Friday.
   About 40,000 Jews are expected to immigrate to Israel this
month, 35,000 of them from the Soviet Union, said Dinitz, whose
agency assists the Israeli government in transporting and
resettling immigrants.
   The pace of immigration has accelerated in recent weeks because
of increasing political and economic uncertainty in the Soviet
Union and better transportation arrangements by Israel, Dinitz told
a news conference.
   The government expects more than 200,000 immigrants this year,
about 90 percent of them Soviets. The total will be second only to
1949, when more than 239,000 immigrants arrived in the state
created a year earlier.
   The flood of newcomers has put a severe strain on housing
nationwide, driving up rents and forcing many families to double up
in scarce units.
   Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz advocates purchasing tents to
house up to 20 percent of the 400,000 Soviets expected next year.
   ``There will be no choice but (to adopt) this solution,'' he was
quoted as saying Friday in the Hebrew newspaper Maariv. He noted
that modern tents can be equipped with lights, heating and
appliances.
   Dinitz rejected tents as an outdated response to a housing
shortage.
   ``In 1990 I think ingenuity can find better accommodation than
tents, especially in winter,'' Dinitz said, urging the installation
of more mobile homes.
   Dinitz urged the government to take over construction. He said
the government set aside funds this year for 45,000 new housing
units, but only 27,000 had been started by private contractors.
   ``In the interim,'' he said, ``we will have to use public
buildings, army camps, hostels, hotels - every available space.''
   Israeli mayors have suggested immigrants be put in bomb
shelters, and Housing Minister Ariel Sharon said Thursday that
small mobile homes should be put on apartment house rooftops and in
the back yards of houses to accommodate the crush.
   Soviets have been pouring into Israel since the spring of 1989,
when the Soviet Union eased its policy on exit permits.
   The number has grown each month this year, and the government
has ordered the El Al national airline to use every available plane
for immigrants. This week, planes have been arriving at half-hour
intervals from transit stops in Hungary, Romania and Poland.
   The government predicts that 1 million Soviets will arrive by
the end of 1992, and Dinitz said the figure could exceed 2 million
before the wave of immigration ends. The country's current
population is about 4.5 million.
   Dinitz repeated the government's claim that it was not directing
the new immigrants to settle in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, home to 1.7 million Palestinians. Many of the Arabs were
forced from Israel when the state was created in 1948.
   He said only a few are settling there, he said, estimating the
number at less than 0.5 percent.
   His estimate did not include Arab east Jerusalem, captured with
the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed by
Israel. An estimated 4,500 Soviets now live in the Arab sector of
the city, according to Western diplomats.
   Palestinians have opposed the Soviet immigration, fearing they
will be displaced and arguing that Israel will be less inclined to
give up the occupied territories.

   Iraq met today with the foreign minister of Yugoslavia, a
representative of the world's non-aligned nations, to discuss ways
to avert war, diplomats said. Iraq denied it has had secret
diplomatic contacts with the United States.
   Britain said it would inoculate its gulf troops against
biological weapons, following a similar U.S. announcement.
   The meeting in Baghdad between Yugoslavia's foreign minister and
his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, came 17 days ahead of the U.N.
deadline for Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait or face possible
war. Yugoslavia, leader of the 102-nation non-aligned movement,
appeared to be launching a new mediation effort.
   The Yugoslav official, Budimir Loncar, was also scheduled to
meet with Saddam Hussein, Yugoslav diplomats said on condition of
anonymity. Loncar visited Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and
Jordan last month for talks.
   Previous attempts at mediation have failed but this new
initiative had at least one distinction: Both Iraq and Kuwait
belong to the non-aligned movement, which rejects any formal
military alliances with East or West.
   Iraq's information minister, Latif Nussayif Jassim, today denied
a report of secret U.S.-Iraqi contacts to avert a conflict, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Radio Monte Carlo quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in
Egypt as saying Iraq was considering some ideas proposed by
Washington. The radio said these include an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait in exchange for assurances that it will not be attacked by
the U.S.-led multinational force that is expected to total more
than half a million troops by the end of January.
   ``These are ridiculous ideas and figments of the imagination,''
Jassim was quoted as saying.
   The United States and Iraq remain at an impasse over dates for
direct talks. Iraq had invited Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to visit on Jan. 12, but the Bush administration say that is
too close to the Jan. 15 deadline. Washington has said any
Baker-Saddam meeting must take place before Thursday.
   In other developments:
   -Vice President Dan Quayle was scheduled to leave late today for
a New Year's visit to U.S. troops sent to the gulf region since
Iraq invaded Kuwait nearly five months ago. Quayle's intinerary
included trips to military outposts in the Saudi Arabian desert.
   -Iraqi media reported up to 300,000 paramilitary troops in the
Kurdish region have been reactivated to shore up the country's
northern border with Turkey, part of the multinational coalition
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   -Lloyd's shipping intelligence has advised vessels off Saudi
Arabia's northern gulf coast to use ``extreme caution'' after two
drifting mines were found earlier this week near the Zuluf oil
field. The Friday report did not say who detected and destroyed the
mines.
   -A 66-year-old Swedish peace activist was hospitalized in Oman
for a heart condition after U.S. forces intercepted an Iraqi ship
she was aboard in the Arabian Sea. Omani Health Ministry officials
said Margaret Andersson was on a cardiac monitor in a hospital
after the U.S. Navy airlifted her from the freighter. She
reportedly suffered chest pains after the boarding, which was
condemned by Baghdad. The freighter was carrying sugar and other
goods in violation of a U.N. embargo on Iraq.
   British and U.S. military officials have not given details of
plans to inoculate troops against biological weapons, which are
germs used to carry diseases such as cholera, anthrax and typhoid.
   About 21,000 British civilians in the gulf region will also
receive gas masks, officials said.
   CIA Director William Webster has said Iraq has stockpiles of
germs, which can be delivered on warheads or by low-flying planes.
Iraq has denied the allegations.
   Some of the problems facing the inoculation program is the wide
variety of vaccines needed and the month or more needed for some
vaccines to take effect, military and medical analysts said.
   The British government on Friday ordered 390 army meical
reservists sent to the gulf after too few volunteers came forward.
It is the first military conscription in Britain since forces were
sent to Cyprus, Borneo and Aden in 1965.
   Saddam has sent an estimated 500,000 troops to southern Iraq and
Kuwait since he seized the emirate on Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil,
land and money.

   Israeli troops shot and killed four
Palestinians, of them two teen-agers, and wounded more than 100 in
a series of violent clashes in the occupied Gaza Strip today,
Israeli and Arab reports said.
   The violence in the town of Gaza and the Rafah refugee camp
began in the afternoon after troops killed two masked Arab
activists who were caught writing slogans on the wall and refused
to obey the soldiers' orders to stop, Israel radio and Palestinian
journalists said.
   The two were identified as 16-year-old Osama Ismail el-Bulbeisi
and 19-year-old Islam Harb. Arab accounts said both were shot in
the head.
   When news of the deaths spread in Rafah, an angry Palestinian
mob pelted the soldiers with stones. Troops fired, killing another
two Arabs, the radio said.
   The reports said more than 100 people were wounded.
   The army command earlier said there were ``local disturbances''
in the refugee camps of Jabaliya and Khan Yunis. In Khan Yunis,
three firebombs were also hurled at Israeli soldiers. No injuries
were reported.
   Israeli officials have predicted there would be a surge in the
3-year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza,
linking it to Tuesday's ``Fatah Day.''
   It marks the 26th anniversary of the first anti-Israeli attack
by Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. In the raid on Jan. 1, 1965, a Fatah
guerrilla squad infiltrated Israel and placed a small bomb at the
country's National Water Carrier. One guerrilla was later killed in
a clash with the Jordanian army.
   At least 781 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians in the revolt. An additional 322 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
Fifty-seven Israelis have also been slain in the violence.

   Police said Israeli gunners shelled
Shiite Moslem villages in the Syrian-policed Bekaa Valley today,
killing four children and wounding three people.
   Israel said the shelling was in response to an attack with
Soviet-made Katyusha rockets, apparently launched from north of
Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern Lebanon.
   The army command in Jerusalem said the rockets, which landed in
the security zone or in Israel, caused no injuries or damage.
   The Lebanese police said the Israeli artillery barrage came at
midday and hit the villages of Mashghara, Sohmor, Maydoun and Ein
el-Tineh, two miles north of the security zone.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said the slain children were three brothers and a
girl, ranging in age from 1 to 4. He said the three wounded adults,
all civilians, were reported to be in critical condition.
   Israel carved out the 440-square-mile security zone in 1985
after a three-year occupation of southern Lebanon. The zone is
designed to protect Israel's northern border from guerrilla
infiltration and is patrolled by Israel and its militia allies of
the South Lebanon Army, a mainly Christian force.

   Police swept through Rome, Catania and other Italian

involvement in a Mafia-run drug, extortion and loan-sharking
operation, officers said.
   The roundup by the carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police,
also turned up equipment apparently used by the suspects to monitor
police communications, according to a statement from the force's

   In all, 31 arrest warrants were issued following an

suspected mob boss from a clan in Catania, eastern Sicily, police
said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said that seven of those named in
the warrants were already in jail.
   Police said they confiscated 33 pounds of hashish.

   Two Soviet cosmonauts will spend the Russian
Christmas on Jan. 7 walking in space, Tass reported Saturday.
   Viktor Afanasyev and Musa Manarov will make another attempt to
repair a broken hatch on a module attached to the orbiting Mir
space station, the official Soviet news agency said.
   Two other cosmonauts spent a grueling seven hours in space in
July trying to repair a torn thermal insulation on their Soyuz TM-9
capsule, only to discover they could not close the hatch leading
back to the space station.
   Soviet media reported at the time they were dangerously close to
running out of oxygen, although the cosmonauts later denied they
had any problems.
   They were able to close the hatch on a subsequent space walk,
but Tass said it continues to cause problems.
   Afanasyev and Manarov took the first journalist into space on
their Dec. 2 launch, Toyohiro Akiyama of Japan's TBS television
network. Akiyama returned to Earth eight days later with the
outgoing cosmonauts.

<HEAD>Time: The `Two Sides Of George Bush' Chosen As `Men' Of Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush was named Time magazine's 1990
man of the year, the magazine announced today. Or rather, the ``two
sides of President Bush'' were dubbed the ``men of the year'' by
the magazine, which praised Bush's foreign policy work while
criticizing his domestic role.
   Each year, the magazine chooses as its woman or man of the year
a person who for better or for worse has the most impact on the
year's events.
   This year, Time said it chose to feature the two faces of
President Bush on the cover of its Jan. 7 issue, which hits
newsstands Monday, because he fits both aspects of the magazine's
definition.
   On foreign policy, Bush ``was a study in resoluteness and
mastery'' while domestically he was ``just as strongly marked by
wavering and confusion.''
   The magazine credited Bush for having ``raised a vision of a new
world order'' with his leadership in the creation of the embargo
and military buildup against Iraq that puts him in a position to
have a ``favorable impact on the course of events.''
   Meanwhile, domestically Bush has left ``things alone until he
could no longer avoid taking action.''
   The two sides of Bush show what interests him, according to the
magazine.
   ``Global diplomacy is what he has trained for and what absorbs
him; domestic affairs are just not as much fun,'' Time said.
   In an interview with Time, Bush blamed the Democratic-controlled
Congress for stalling his domestic plans.
   ``To accomplish things, you have first got to beat down the
Democrats. And that's not true in foreign affairs,'' Bush said.
   About Iraq, Bush said his gut feeling is that Saddam Hussein
will withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``But that flies in the face of what some of the Arab leaders
tell me, which is that he cannot get out. He cannot do in Kuwait
what he did in Iran. He cannot do it and survive domestically,''
Bush said.
   Four others cited by Time as among the year's most important
newsmakers were Saddam, Nelson Mandela, Helmut Kohl and Boris
Yeltsin.
   Bush is the ninth U.S. president or president-elect to be
selected for the Man of the Year issue. The others are Franklin D.
Roosevelt, 1932, 1934 and 1941; Harry S. Truman, 1945 and 1948;
Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1959 (also selected in 1944, before he became
president); John F. Kennedy in 1961; Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and
1967; Richard M. Nixon, winner in 1971 and co-winner in 1972 with
Henry Kissinger; President-elect Jimmy Carter in 1976; and Ronald
Reagan, winner as president-elect in 1980 and co-winner with Yuri
Andropov in 1983.

   Authorities blamed the first snowstorm of the
season for an electrical fire that trapped four rush-hour trains in
a smoke-filled subway tunnel, killing one person and injuring 150
others. A second rider died of her injuries today.
   In Boston, authorities investigating a trolley accident that
injured 33 people Friday said tests showed the trolley driver had
high levels of alcohol in his system. It was the second rail
accident this month in the city's Back Bay section.
   The driver of the trolley, which rammed a streetcar that was
unloading passengers, blamed faulty brakes for the collision,
officials said. But investigators ruled that out as a possible
cause, said Peter Dimond, spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority.
   The fire Friday morning in New York filled trains with smoke in
a subway tunnel linking Manhattan and Brooklyn. Fire and transit
officials said melting snow from a 7-inch snowfall overnight
apparently caused an electrical short-circuit.
   Passengers heard explosions and then saw smoke, first pouring
into the tunnel and then into their trains.
   ``We really thought we were gone, that we wouldn't see New
Year's,'' said Gertrude Hoyte, a 51-year-old Brooklyn resident
trapped in the tunnel. Some people began vomiting into their
newspapers, she said.
   ``People were screaming, `We're going to die!''' and others
prayed out loud, said 28-year-old Dana Sullivan.
   Andrew Rea, 29, said that as smoke began filling the train, it
``got so bad you couldn't see halfway down the car.''
   ``A lot of people passed out,'' said Naomi Smalls-Watson, 23.
   Transit Authority spokeswoman Caren Gardner said the exact cause
was unclear, but that snow may have fallen onto the electrified
third rail and caused an electrical cable to short.
   The dead man was identified by Transit Police spokesman Al
O'Leary as Peter Hagen, 35, of Smithtown. The cause of death was
under investigation.
   Another rider, a 37-year-old Massapequa Park woman, died this
morning at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, said said
nursing supervisor Adriene Kushner. Se had been revived at the
hospital Friday after appearing dead at the scene.
   Authorities said 150 people were injured, including some police
and firefighters. Injuries ranged from smoke inhalation to cuts and
bruises.
   Transit Police Capt. Michael Ansbro said 300 to 400 people were
on the 10-car train that carried most of the injured.
   Fire Commissioner Carlos M. Rivera said the accident couldn't
have been prevented. ``It's something that is beyond our control -
nature does what nature wants to do.''
   Boston's Green Line trolley crash occurred during morning rush
hour when one trolley rammed the rear of a second parked in the
underground Arlington Street station. Transit officials said each
had about 40 people aboard.
   ``The driver in the rear car, the car that did the hitting ... a
20-year veteran, was found to test positive for alcohol,'' Dimond
said. The 64-year-old driver, whose name was not released, was
suspended without pay pending the outcome of the investigation,
Dimond said.
   Dimond declined to specify the driver's blood-alcohol content,
but said it was ``high.'' He said investigators had ruled out brake
failure and the signal system as possible causes.
   Ernest Jones, a passenger on the stationary trolley, said one
minute he was reading his newspaper, the next the lights were out
and he saw at least four people bleeding from head injuries.
   ``I was looking at the lady across from me, next thing I knew
the lights went out and she was on the floor,'' he said. ``I saw
one man in the back on the floor on his back, crying, obviously in
agony, hurt.''
   Most of the injured people were treated and released at area
hospitals. One was seriously hurt and taken to New England Medical
Center and another was admitted to University Hospital.
   More than 260 people were injured Dec. 12 when an Amtrak train
derailed in the area.

<HEAD>Vaccinating Against Germ Warfare a Long Shot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's plan to inoculate troops in the
Persian gulf against germ warfare agents is a medical roll of the
dice, because no single vaccine works against all of the hundreds
of microbes that could be used in a biological attack, experts say.
   For a military force to be immune to any such assault, the
troops would have to be vaccinated weeks or even months in advance
and the vaccines used would have to exactly match the microbes used
in the attack, the medical authorities say.
   ``With most vaccines it takes from two to four weeks to develop
adequate immune protection,'' said Dr. Bradley Sack, a Johns
Hopkins University expert on infectious diseases. And, often, he
said, full protection for some specific diseases could take up to
several months.
   To develop immunity, the body of each soldier would have to be
exposed to a vaccine and then have time to build up the billions of
antibodies needed to repel the disease.
   If vaccinations of U.S. forces don't start until next week, Sack
said, it is unlikely that the troops would all have developed the
full immunity needed by Jan. 15, the U.N.-set date for Iraq to pull
out of Kuwait or face military action.
   U.S. military officials refuse to identify any particular
disease for which troops will be vaccinated. But published reports
have said that Iraq's biological arsenal may include these
diseases: typhoid, cholera, anthrax, rabbit fever and botulism.
   This group, says Dr. Sanford Kuvin, vice chairman of the
National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, ``is only the short
list'' of possibilities.
   ``If you restrict the biological warfare possibilities to the
short list of common things, it could probably be dealt with in a
moderately effective way by the U.S. military,'' he said.
   But the real problem, said Kuvin, is that nature has provided so
many microbe warriors that can be marshaled into armies.
   ``The menu of lethality is very long,'' said Kuvin. ``There are
innumerable viral diseases. And I don't know how you could make a
cocktail of vaccines that would be effective against them all.''
   And there are problems even with the ``short list.''
   There is a vaccine for anthrax, the most popular candidate named
by experts as a possible biological weapon. But the vaccine is not
commercially available and few American doctors, even in the
military, have ever dealt with it.
   ``There's very little of that disease in this country,'' said
Sack.
   But another expert, who asked not to be named, said that the
military is thought to have developed an anthrax vaccine designed
for use in combat situations.
   Cholera, another disease candidate on the short list, has
virtually no effective vaccine. Sack said there is an experimental
oral vaccine that has been tested in Bangladesh, but it has not
been tried in this country.
   ``I've heard that the military may want to use it,'' he said.
``Of the little we have, it seems to be the most effective. It
takes at least three doses over a month.''
   For typhoid, there is an oral vaccine that provides 65 to 70
percent protection with few side effects. It requires four doses
over eight days and immunity is good within 10 days of the last
dose, said Sack.
   Science has no vaccine for rabbit fever, or tularemia. Neither
is there one for botulism, the common food-borne bacteria. Both
diseases can be fatal, but both will respond to antibiotics.
   Kuvin said, however, the biological weapons that are of most
concern to him are the hundreds of microbes that are rarely or
never seen in the United States, but which could be devastating to
American troops.
   There are organisms, he said, that spring up from Africa or Asia
or South America, wipe out large populations and then burn
themselves out, only to pop up again years later somewhere else.
They bear names like Blue Nile virus, Rift Valley fever, Marburg
virus, dengue fever or lassa fever.
   ``Some of these are almost universally lethal,'' said Kuvin. And
there is no proven vaccine for many of them.
   And even if there were vaccines for them all, which should
American troops be protected against? That, said the experts, is
the military and biological gamble.
   If the Americans choose correctly, then the U.S. troops would be
protected. But if the soldiers are inoculated for one group of
diseases and then are attacked with weapons containing a totally
different disease, the results, said Kuvin, could be
``devastating.''
   The physician, however, said all of these factors are well-known
to the Army experts who have studied biological warfare for years.
   ``I know, for a fact, that the Army has the best microbe hunters
in the world,'' said Kuvin. ``If anyone does, they have the experts
to solve the problems we have discussed.''

<TEXT>
   For the new Congress convening on Thursday,
the questions of peace and war are waiting, with added urgency as
the days dwindle toward the Jan. 15 for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   Five months of intermittent debate and a dozen House and Senate
hearings have produced no answers and scant guidance to define the
role of the Democratic Congress in a crisis under Republican
management.
   At this point, it's a crisis on hold for the holidays.
   At a quiet Capitol, recorded telephone messages report some
offices closed until after the New Year. President Bush is at Camp
David, Md., on an 11-day break.
   There's little traffic and less tension in the capital, even as
reinforcements are deployed in the Persian Gulf and the Saudi
Arabian desert, building to the troop strength that could deliver
on the U.S. threat to take the offensive after mid-January. That's
when the United Nations has authorized the use of force if
necessary.
   According to the Democratic leaders of Congress, U.S. forces
cannot be sent to fight without congressional approval. According
to the Republican administration, Bush already has all the
authority he needs to act.
   That debate will resume when Congress does. It won't be
conclusive. The answer has been elusive for two centuries under a
constitutional system that makes the president the commander in
chief and empowers only Congress to declare war.
   Bush has met with congressional leaders several times over the
Gulf crisis, and, according to Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, will do so again Thursday, as soon as the new Congress is
sworn in. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III also are expected to participate in the
sessions.
   There were demands during the fall that Congress be summoned
back to declare war. There were calls for a resolution of approval
for Bush's policy of threatening military action against Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait. There were proposals to invoke the creaky
machinery of the war powers system, under which a president can't
send troops into danger unless Congress approves.
   None of that happened, and none of it is likely to happen now.
   But in one form or another, the 102nd Congress is going to have
to come to clear, majority decisions on the Persian Gulf, possibly
but not necessarily on direct questions of policy, certainly on the
money and manpower to back up that policy.
   The administration will need a supplemental appropriation of up
to $20 billion early this year to finance Operation Desert Shield.
Call-up authority for some support units summoned to active duty
will begin expiring in March unless Congress extends it or Bush
declares a national emergency.
   And there may have to be action later in the year to change the
timetable for cutbacks that are supposed to reduce active duty
military forces by at least 80,000 before next Sept. 30.
   An attempt to write a policy resolution and get it through House
and Senate would be risky for both Congress and the White House.
Bush has been quoted as telling members of Congress that he would
welcome a resolution of support, along the lines of the United
Nations resolution authorizing force after Jan. 15, but ``if you're
going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion and
argue about it, then that may not be helpful ... ''
   Resolutions endorsing his policy were adopted by overwhelming
votes in the House and Senate early in October, backing ``continued
action by the president ... to deter Iraqi aggression and protect
American lives and vital interests.'' But the authors of those
measures said they covered only what had been done to that point,
and did not authorize the use of force.
   When those measures passed, the strategy for forcing Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait was built around economic sanctions against
Iraq, with the United States assigned to defend Saudi Arabia
against any attack by Saddam Hussein's forces.
   On Nov. 8, Bush ordered U.S. forces doubled, to create the
capability and raise the possibility of military action to retake
Kuwait. Democratic leaders were told of the decision shortly before
Bush announced it. And support that had been almost unanimous began
to fray, with Democrats urging patience, to give economic sanctions
more time to work.
   But Democrats can't risk becoming the party of dissent while
American forces are at risk. That could weaken the U.S. position in
the current confrontation, at a time when Bush says the best way to
avoid war is to convince Saddam Hussein that he faces war unless he
relents. And it could do them lasting political damage. Vice
President Dan Quayle produced a preview of a Republican
counterattack, saying earlier this month that ``patience at any
price'' would amount to appeasement of Saddam Hussein.
   As the debate resumes, Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, the
majority leader, says whatever the differences on timing and
tactics, the United States is united on the goal of getting Iraq
out of Kuwait.
   The question is how.

   An Air Force weather forecaster
said Saturday the U.S. military isn't getting important data
collected by Saudi Arabia, even as winter sandstorms and choppy
seas pose new obstacles for U.S.-led forces.
   Although the kingdom does supply some information, it does not
share data on wind speed and direction, fearing that teletype
reports would aid Iraq in launching a chemical or biological
attack., the forecaster said.
   ``It's not as good as what we get in the States,'' said Capt.
Judy Dickey, referring to the extensive network of weather
reporting stations operated by the military and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``They aren't transmitting any wind data because of the chemical
threat. They don't want the upper level winds to go out worldwide
so the Iraqis could pick it up,'' she said.
   She said the forecasts are good enough to provide planning
information for commanders to help them decide whether to attack.
But still, the U.S. military could use the wind data to help plan a
defense against chemical attack, she said.
   Capt. Dickey, who produces forecasts for the 1st Tactical
Fighter Wing, said the nightmare condition would be a ``shamal'' -
a violent, 100-mile-wide sandstorm that could shut down air
operations and impede ground units in combat.
   The shamal, or northwest wind, is a rare occurrence that drives
sand at speeds of more than 50 mph and can cause haze as high as
18,000 feet. Sand propelled at that speed can strip paint from
cars.
   Moreover, she said, the same conditions that give rise to the
shamal also can cause smaller disturbances that affect specific
regions, hampering air, ground, and sea operations.
   At Christmas, for example, Dickey thought a shamal was brewing.
Blowing sand cut visibility to one mile, with winds at 32 mph.
   ``That was sort of a little precursor to a shamal,'' she said.
``Sort of a little appetizer, I guess.''
   She said forecasters could only give a two-to-three day warning
of a shamal.
   The United States has a limited weather staff in Saudi Arabia,
split primarily between the Air Force and the Navy. Capt. Dickey
said measurement of weather conditons is the most difficult
problem.
   Comprehensive data, which requires the regular launching of
weather balloons and surface measurements from a wide area, are not
collected regularly by the military, she said. They depend on the
Saudis for the rest.
   The 25-year-old captain from Anaheim, Calif. said some data is
collected from occasional balloon launches by the Marine Corps.
``When they do it, we get great data. But they don't have enough
balloons to do it twice a day like we do in the States.''
   The military is coping by pooling data obtained from pilots, but
such general information is useless for pinpointing the localized
``dust devils'' that play havoc with ground forces. The best the
military can do is warn ground forces that conditions are favorable
for a sandstorm in a given region.
   At sea, military sources have said swells of eight feet and
greater have been observed. High seas could delay amphibious
landings by some landing craft.
   Soldiers are already coping with markedly colder temperatures in
eastern Saudi Arabia. Capt. Dickey said January - the month in
which combat operations could begin - is one of the coldest, with
overnight lows in the 40s.
   It's a big switch from 100-degree-plus temperatures that greeted
the first units of the U.S. force deployed to Saudi Arabia
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In the northern desert, temperatures plunged to 34 degrees
Thursday and Friday night, forcing soldiers to burrow deeper into
their sleeping bags.
   ``You can feel it down to the bone. If you don't wear your
longjohns, you'll be freezing,'' said Army Spec. Hector Macias, 25,
of El Paso, Texas.

   Another arctic cold wave rolled across the United States,
knocking out power to thousands, stranding holiday travelers,
taking lives and threatening what was left of California's
frost-ravaged citrus crop and the very trees themselves.
   The latest cold front, accompanied by howling winds, freezing
rain and snow, hit most of the continental United States on Friday,
leaving only parts of the Southeast untouched.
   It was expected to keep an icy grip on most of the nation at
least through Sunday, although parts of the East Coast, including
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania,
were warming up today after heavy snows made roads treacherous
Friday.
   But in the Dakotas, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah, temperatures
plummeted. Dickinson, N.D., plunged to a record early this morning
at minus 25 degrees, or three degrees colder than in 1946.
Williston recorded 28 below. Gusty northwest winds made it feel
more like 80 below in western North Dakota overnight, the National
Weather Service said.
   In Iowa on Friday night, more than 70 cars and trucks slid into
ditches or into each other on ice-glazed Interstate 35 north of Des
Moines, but no serious injuries were reported.
   ``All I know is it's really bad,'' said Lori Pruismann, a
cashier at Touchdown truck stop near Webster City. ``Most truckers
are staying right where they're at.''
   One day after Pennsylvania residents struggled with snow up to
16 inches deep, they are facing another hurdle to driving - fog.
   ``The whole state's pretty much blanketed in fog,'' Doug Young,
a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said today.
   The fog is produced by warm air moving over the cold snow,
causing the snow to evaporate. Visibility in many places this
morning ranged from a half-mile to zero, according to the weather
service.
   In California, highs were expected to reach the 40s and 50s, but
inland lows in the 20s were predicted, further threatening the
state's embattled citrus crop.
   ``It won't be the bitter cold that occurred last weekend, but
people will still have to take care to shelter plants and
animals,'' said Betty Reo of the National Weather Service in
California. ``In the coldest areas, farmers will suffer more crop
damage.''
   Growers estimate half the state's navel orange crop, $288
million worth, was destroyed by the last cold snap. Now they are
worried about the citrus trees themselves.
   ``How much can (the trees) take? Night after night after night.
And then they get hit again,'' said Tom McNair, a statistician with
the state Department of Agriculture.
   Elsewhere, the latest round of storms knocked out power to tens
of thousands on Friday; stranded thousands more on roads, in homes
or at airports; resulted in hundreds of injuries; and claimed
several lives.
   There have been more than 90 weather-related deaths since the
wave of cold began Dec. 18.
   In New York City, one person was killed and 150 injured when
heavy snow caused an electrical short-circuit that filled a subway
tunnel with smoke. A second rider died of her injuries today.
   Two men in Connecticut suffered fatal heart attacks while
shoveling snow, a 17-year-old Connecticut youth died when the car
he was riding in overturned, a 7-year-old Ohio boy was killed when
a mound of snow fell on him and a woman in Washington state was
killed when heavy winds blew a tree onto her car.
   Heavy fog delayed flights in and out of Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport overnight, and fog in Oklahoma City closed
the Will Rogers World Airport for several hours early Friday.
   In Montana, scores of travelers flocked to a Red Cross shelter
in Kalispell after abandoning their cars along snowbound highways.
   In Arkansas, an ice storm sent trees crashing into power lines,
knocking out electricity to about 70,000 homes. About 700 were
expected to remain without power today.
   Washington state, blasted by heavy snow last week, was hit by
fierce winds in the western part of the state and snow to the east
on Friday.
   The winds knocked out power to about 150,000, blew down hundreds
of trees and whipped up heavy surf that damaged a half-dozen homes
on Vashon Island, south of Seattle.
   About 85,000 customers were without power late Friday and many
were expected to go without through the weekend.
   Crews in Ortonville, Minn., worked in below-zero temperatures
today to restore power, which went out about 9:30 p.m. Friday. The
entire western Minnesota city of some 2,600 residents was affected
as the wind-chill index dropped to about 50 below zero.
   In eastern Washington, officials worried that frigid
temperatures today might create ice jams that would cause rivers to
flood.
   More cold weather and snow was also forecast for parts of Nevada
and Arizona over the weekend, although some in Arizona were looking
forward to the prospect.
   ``We need it for our water table and for the health of the
forest,'' said Tim Grier, owner of Forest Lakes Touring Center and
Cabins.

<TEXT>
   In July 1989, a band of reporters quit a
pro-China newspaper in Hong Kong because they opposed Beijing's
crackdown on a movement for democracy and wanted to report the
truth.
   They started a magazine on China and called it Contemporary. It
was going to be different - independent and analytical.
   But a year after the first issue hit the stands, Contemporary is
foundering - hurt by falling circulation, a virtual boycott on
advertising and a lack of reporters willing to brave criticism from
hardline Chinese officials to report the news.
   What's happening to Contemporary sums up what's happening to
Hong Kong's once freewheeling press.
   1997, the year Communist China takes control of the British
colony, looms as a dangerous deadline for the media in Hong Kong.
   Reporters and editors say they face a choice: Either don't
insult China or leave - the profession or even the territory.
   Contemporary, for example, has lost about half of its 15
founding members, all of whom came from the hardline Wen Wei Po
newspaper. Some have immigrated to the West; others have taken jobs
at less controversial publications.
   Already one religious newsletter is moving its headquarters from
Hong Kong to Bangkok. Several other international publications are
believed to be exploring the same.
   ``We're adopting a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Barry Wain,
publisher of the American-owned Asian Wall Street Journal. ``Our
attitude is that we've made no plans to leave.''
   But the bulk of Hong Kong's 60 plus daily newspapers and 600
plus magazines live and breath the territory. They have nowhere to
go.
   To succeed, reporters at Chinese and English-language
publications say one has to practice self-censorship. And there are
fewrewards for bucking the trend.
   Exploring sensitive topics scares advertisers, loses reporters
access to news conferences and doesn't necessarily win more
readers.
   In the last few months, Contemporary's circulation has dropped
from 10,000 to 8,000, despite a series of well-written pieces on
China's military and several scoops about the workings of the
Xinhua News Agency, China's de facto embassy to the territory.
   Its reporters are now banned from China.
   ``When I started this thing I firmly believed that a society as
rich as Hong Kong could support a serious magazine,'' said Ching
Cheong, Contemporary's editor-in-chief. ``Now I'm dismayed to find
that's not the case.''
   Cheong said the magazine needed to reach 15,000 to break even.
And that's with advertising.
   But Contemporary's ad space has dwindled to nothing due to
apparent pressure from Beijing-controlled companies on potential
advertisers, Cheong said.
   One American-educated advertising executive, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he received a phone call earlier this
year from a Chinese-owned company asking him why his firm placed
ads in Contemporary.
   ``It was subtle, but the message was clear. If we wanted
mainland business, we couldn't deal with Contemporary,'' he said.
   Attempts by journalists to quantify such pressure have failed,
said Emily Lau, a correspondent for the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
Economic Review and the president of the Hong Kong Journalists
Association.
   Several months ago, the association's executive committee
proposed a seminar on the topic. No one attended.
   ``It's a pretty dismal situation,'' Lau said. ``Everybody knows
it's happening but nobody has the guts to confront the issue.''
   Under a historic agreement between China and Britain, the
Chinese have promised to preserve Hong Kong's way of life for at
least 50 years after Beijing takes over in 1997. Clause 5 of the
agreement guarantees freedom of speech and the press.
   But faith in China's pledge has been shaken in the past year by
the crackdown on a pro-democracy movement in Beijing. Chinese
authorities arrested dozens of mainland reporters and editors and
closed or reorganized under hardline leadership several newspapers.
   ``If they treat their reporters like that, how will they treat
us after '97?'' asks Juan Tze, a leading political cartoonist in
the territory.
   Few reporters and editors in the territory have much trust in
Britain's ability to keep China to its word.
   The colonial government itself passed a law in 1988 that allows
the banning of films that could seriously damage relations with
other countries, most notably China. It was most recently invoked
earlier this year when the first half of a Taiwanese film,
``Mainland China 1989'' was cut because it included interviews with
prominent Chinese dissidents.
   To increase its influence, China is also moving into Hong Kong's
media business.
   In October, the Xinhua News Agency announced the launching of
China's first magazine in the territory, a glossy periodical named
Bauhinia after Hong Kong's territorial flower. In 1988, several
Beijing-owned companies merged to form Sino-United Publishing Ltd.,
the largest publishing house and book seller in Hong Kong.
   ``This is not a game,'' Cheong said. ``It's a serious political
struggle.''
   But ironically, it appears to be a struggle that interests few
people in the territory.
   Contemporary's circulation, for example, pales when compared to
the 130,000 of the Ming Pao Weekly which serves up a fare of
gossip, glossy watch advertisements and revealing photographs of
slinky Chinese models.
   And of the territory's 60 plus daily newspapers, more focus on
horse racing, a local obsession, than anything else.

<HEAD>Dukakis Closes the Book on Some 30 Years in Public Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a 30-year political career, Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis is the same cool, untiring technocrat and unflappable
optimist. But if there's any change in Dukakis as he prepares to
leave office Thursday, it may be that he finally managed to lighten
up a little bit.
   He has made spontaneous jokes beyond the canned lines provided
by speech writers. He's used humor to take on old adversaries. He's
shaken hands and posed for photographs with anybody who asked. One
day, he started whistling during a break in a press conference.
   On a recent helicopter trip across the state, Dukakis refrained
from emotional reminiscing with an accompanying reporter. But among
old political allies, nostalgia - and an uncommon lightheartedness
- hung in the air.
   Dukakis recalled, for example, a campaign trip in the early
1980s when the pants to his suit split.
   ``I'm walking around with my back to the wall trying to get the
endorsement of the teachers,'' he said. ``They said, `Take your
coat off and stay.'''
   The memories span a political career that began as a town
meeting member in his hometown of Brookline, the birthplace of John
F. Kennedy. Dukakis still lives there in a modest residential
neighborhood.
   Born to Greek immigrants Nov. 3, 1933, Dukakis went to Brookline
High School, then Swarthmore College and Harvard University Law
School. He was first elected to the Massachusetts House in 1962. In
1970, he lost a bid to become lieutenant governor.
   He won the governor's seat in 1974, but, after raising taxes and
cutting social spending, he lost the Democratic primary to Edward
King in 1978. The resilient Dukakis came back in 1982, beating King
in a rematch, and won a third term by a landslide in 1986.
   Dukakis then became one of the so-called Seven Dwarfs seeking
the Democratic nomination. He was at the height of his popularity
when he left the Atlanta convention with his party's endorsement.
   But his performance in the waning weeks of the campaign
disappointed many, and voters went overwhelmingly for Bush.
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' Dukakis said after he lost.
   Two months later, with what he had ballyhooed as the state's
``miracle'' economy collapsing, he announced he would not seek
re-election as governor.
   While the state's financial rating neared the junk-bond level
and his popularity plummeted, Dukakis' wife, Kitty, drank rubbing
alcohol and sought treatment for alcoholism.
   Then his lieutenant governor, Evelyn Murphy, caused an uproar by
threatening to implement programs of her own while Dukakis was out
of the state. He postponed the trip and squelched the rebellion.
   Dukakis was steadfast throughout. He kept cutting ribbons,
swearing in judges and breaking ground on new projects through his
final days in office.
   And as he leaves office, even Ron Kaufman, a White House aide
and former state Republican activist, had words of praise.
   ``You've got to give the governor some points,'' Kaufman said.
``He, with all his problems now, brought a sense of honesty to
government that no one ever doubted.''
   Dukakis counts among his major achievements in office a job
training program for welfare recipients, a bill that made health
care available to all state residents, and economic incentives that
helped keep a boom running through much of the 1980s.
   He hasn't ruled out the possibility of another run for political
office, although he says that's not the first thing on his mind
these days.
   His immediate plans call for him to travel to Australia, then to
Hawaii, where he will teach political science at the University of
Hawaii.
   William Schneider, the political analyst who's teaching at
Boston College this year, gives Dukakis little hope of resurrecting
his presidential aspirations.
   ``I'd say he's looked upon with contempt,'' Schneider said.
``He's probably the most despised man in American politics along
with Richard Nixon because Democrats believe, I think unfairly,
that he lost the election through incompetence.''
   But if a Democrat wins the presidency, Dukakis may find a
position, Schneider said.
   ``He would probably play some role in that administration, quite
likely in the Cabinet in the health area,'' Schneider said.
   Another former failed Democratic presidential hopeful, Walter
Mondale, urged Dukakis to take time off and to give himself time.
   Mondale noted his one-time boss, former President Jimmy Carter,
has found renewed respect and popularity since leaving office.
   ``Mike's had a tough couple of years here. When this settles,
he's going to find that he's a lot more respected than he might
gather,'' Mondale said. ``I think there's a healing process that
doesn't come quickly.''

   Hijackers commandeered an Algerian
passenger jetliner with 88 people on board but released 23 hostages
today during talks with the government, officials said.
   The hijackers demanded to be flown to another country,
preferably Egypt, Libya or Tunisia, according to sources and news
reports.
   There were conflicting reports on the identity of the hijackers.
The state news agency APS, citing sources, said they were
Algerians, but Algerian radio said they were Islamic
fundamentalists from Tunisia.
   The Air Algerie Boeing 737 was hijacked Friday night during a
domestic flight from Ghardaia to Algiers, the capital, and was
forced to land in Annaba, 250 miles east of Algiers.
   Police surrounded the plane today, and government officials
began negotiating with the hijackers. Officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said 23 people, including men, woman and
children, were freed by this afternoon.
   The nationalities of the freed hostages were not disclosed.
   Airline officials said 14 foreign nationals were among the 82
passengers and six crew members. Most of the foreigners appeared to
be French and Spanish tourists.
   Western diplomats said no Americans appeared to be on board.
   The state-owned airline did not disclose the number of
hijackers.
   Police sources said the hijackers demanded to fly to Tunisia on
Friday night but that the neighboring country refused the request.
   Today the hijackers sought refuge in Egypt, but that country
also denied permission for the plane to land, sources close to the
investigation said.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency cited the French Radio Monte
Carlo as saying the hijackers wanted to go to Libya. No source was
given.
   The Algerian transport and interior ministers arrived in Annaba
this morning to oversee efforts to free the passengers.
   The hijackers demanded water and kerosene, the sources at the
scene said.

<TEXT>
   Confined to a house in a wealthy Dhaka
suburb, ousted President Hussain Muhammad Ershad reads poetry and
occasionally asks his guards plaintively about weather or politics.
   Outside, the capital's streets and newspapers are full of the
gossip that until Ershad's fall was talked about only in the byways
of the bazaars and the private rooms of the country's rich and
would-be powerful people.
   The allegations gathered steam and contributed to the outrage
that finally forced the 60-year-old ex-general to relinquish power.
After two months of protests led by opposition parties and
university students, Ershad resigned as president on Dec. 6, eight
years after he seized power in a bloodless coup.
   Newspapers, including government-owned ones that once carried
only laudatory accounts of Ershad's public deeds, now print saucy
stories full of allegations of corruption and clandestine romances.
   ``Ershad's girlfriend is in jail,'' blared a headline in the
Bengali-language Inqilab the day after Zeenat Mosharaf, wife of a
top official in the Ershad government, was arrested along with her
husband.
   A headline in the English-language Morning Sun said ``Fast Lady
and Husband Arrested.''
   For the past three years, opposition politicians had been
doggedly demanding Ershad's resignation, accusing him in tedious
rhetoric of running a corrupt military dictatorship. But this time,
from the bazaars, the campuses and the mosques, come new
anti-Ershad slogans.
   He has been denounced as an ``emperor'' and a ``womanizer,''
epithets that struck an unsavory tone of opulence and decadence in
his impoverished Islamic nation. Eighty percent of Bangladesh's 110
million people live below the poverty line, which means they can't
afford enough food to meet minimum health requirements.
   Just before and after Ershad's fall from power, teen-age boys
dressed up in women's clothing and paraded through the streets,
mockingly claiming to be presidential girlfriends.
   With Ershad and his wife, Raushan, under house arrest and
expected to stand trial on charges of corruption and abuse of
power, the newspapers have gone public with the long-talked-about
allegations of shady business deals and love affairs.
   Dainik Bangla, a government-owned daily, claimed Ershad and
Zeenat Mosharaf used to meet at a guest house owned by the
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corp. Zeenat's husband, Mosharaf
Hossain, was the company's chairman until 1988 when he was given a
job in Ershad's government as secretary of the Ministry of
Industries.
   The newspaper claimed Zeenat, who is in her 40s, got a BCIC
business deal worth $10.6 million in 1989 without submitting legal
tenders.
   Another story now making the public rounds concerns Mariam
Mumtaz, a Bangladeshi woman who lives in the United States and
claims to be ``the second Mrs. Ershad.''
   In 1986, Britain's Observer newspaper quoted Ms. Mumtaz as
saying she secretly married Ershad on Aug. 14, 1982, after he
forced her to divorce banker Chowdhury Badruddin. Early in 1990,
the story surfaced again in the New York Post and London's Sunday
Correspondent.
   Ms. Mumtaz was quoted as saying Ershad had concealed $150
million in secret bank accounts in the United States and
Switzerland.
   Now the stories are being reprinted in local newspapers, along
with a photo of Ms. Mumtaz and Ershad holding hands.
   Ershad and his relatives have made no public response to the
allegations. But a source at the Home Ministry said Ershad has
asked government permission to hire a lawyer to respond in court.
   ``We have got the request for a lawyer from him. It's under
study,'' the source said, speaking on condition he was not
identified further. He declined to give any other details.
   Ershad presumably is reading some of the newspaper reports,
despite his isolation. Some of the 150 guards assigned to watch him
said he gets two local newspapers every day.
   ``He does not talk much to us. But he sometimes comes down to
the lawn and usually asks about how politics are shaping up in the
country,'' one of the guards said. ``On Friday he was talking about
weather.''
   The guard said Raushan Ershad rarely leaves her room and spends
most of her time watching movies on a video machine.
   ``But Ershad sometimes behaves in a way that suggests he hates
the loneliness. He craves human contacts,'' said another guard, who
like the first spoke on condition he not be identified.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu revamped his Cabinet
on Saturday, resisting pressure from party leaders to give posts to
some powerful but scandal-tainted politicians.
   Kaifu also jettisoned his justice minister, who had drawn fire
for insulting American blacks. However, the minister was given
another important post.
   Both the minister of international trade and industry and the
agriculture minister were also replaced, a move that could affect
some trade negotiations with the United States and other countries.
   Yet no major policy changes were expected from the reshuffle, in
which 17 new members were named to the 21-member Cabinet.
   Officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party said the
administration was concerned with maintaining a unified front in
the face of the Persian Gulf crisis and friction over international
trade. Also, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is scheduled to
visit in April.
   The annual rotation of Cabinet posts has become a party
tradition because lawmakers expect to assume a ministerial position
after serving five or six terms in Parliament.
   Kaifu succeeded in keeping his three principal Cabinet members:
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
and Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto, the principal
government spokesman.
   None of those named to the Cabinet was linked to last year's
Recruit influence-pedding scandal. Kaifu was named prime minister
mainly because his ``clean'' image positioned him as a compromise
replacement for those affected by the scandal.
   Analysts said Kaifu would have lost any remaining credibility
had he opened his Cabinet to senior politicians tainted by the
affair, in which the Recruit job-placement conglomerate had offered
lucrative unlisted stock to influential politicians.
   Underscoring the effort to distance the government from the
scandal, the new Cabinet member agreed to refrain from stock
transactions while in office, Kyodo News Service reported.
   The departing justice minister, Seiroku Kajiyama, again
apologized for remarks made this fall in which he compared U.S.
blacks to prostitutes. The comments provoked an international
outcry.
   ``I feel relieved now that I quit my post,'' Kajiyama told
reporters. However, he was appointed chairman of the Liberal
Democratic Party's legislative affairs committee, an important
position.
   Kajiyama was replaced by Megumu Sato, 66, who like Nakao and
Kondo is a member of one of the party's three most powerful
factions.
   The new international trade minister is Eiichi Nakao, 60, an
eight-term lawmaker who formerly served as director-general of the
Economic Planning Agenc. He replaced Kabun Muto.
   The new agriculture minister is Motoji Kondo, 60, a five-term
lawmaker in his first cabinet post, replacing Tomio Yamamoto.
   Kaifu's administration also includes its first woman since his
last Cabinet reshuffle in February. She is Akiko Santo, a
48-year-old former television personality and Upper House member
who was named director-general of the Science and Technology
Agency.

   In the year since a defeated Manuel Noriega was
dramatically delivered to the U.S. justice system, sideshows and
legal maneuvers have repeatedly sidetracked the drug-trafficking
case against him.
   Red underwear, tape-recorded conversations, frozen Swiss bank
accounts, missing documents, contempt charges against a television
network, an exercise bicycle and endless wrangling over attorneys'
fees have overshadowed what was billed as a showcase trial that
would cap the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``There have been a lot of twists and turns,'' U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler reflected in an interview earlier this
month. ``It's like the quest for the Holy Grail.''
   Amid the hoopla, prosecutors have strengthened their case
quietly by plea bargaining with co-conspirators who may be able to
tie the deposed Panamanian leader directly to drug payoffs.
   The latest coup was a guilty plea Dec. 6 by Luis del Cid, a
former Noriega aide who confessed to handing drug cash directly to
his boss.
   ``The most important developments have been the increased
evidence,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. As for the
unexpected hitches, he said, ``They will disappear and become a
footnote to history.''
   Just when that increased evidence will be heard by a jury is
unclear. Since Noriega's Jan. 3 surrender, the trial date has
slipped from March 1990 to January 1991 to spring 1991. The defense
has asked it be postponed at least until June.
   Panama, meanwhile, is pursuing a $6.5 billion federal damage
lawsuit against Noriega, and has asked for his extradition to face
charges of murdering a major who attempted a 1989 coup. On Friday,
the head of the Panamanian Supreme Court said Noriega also is
suspected in the 1985 decapitation slaying of leftist opponent Hugo
Spadafora.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino says he believes - or at
least hopes - the drug case will be over in another year.
   ``I think the general will be back in Panama and running the
country,'' Rubino says.
   But he's not sure he'll be the winning attorney. Rubino has
announced he will withdraw unless the government finds a way to
unfreeze some of $20 million tied up in European bank accounts.
   He says he and his two fellow attorneys often work until 11:30
p.m. even though they haven't been paid since Noriega's surrender
in January. Rubino has been forced to take other cases to pay the
bills, he complains, giving him even less time to work on the
complicated case.
   He blames some of the controversies on overzealous prosecutors.
   ``I would have thought that they would try to give the general a
fair trial, instead of doing everything they can to thwart it -
wiretapping his phones, freezing his bank accounts,'' Rubino said.
   Rubino's complaints forced the U.S. government to ask reluctant
European authorities to release millions of dollars to the man the
United States accuses of accepting $4.6 million from Colombia's
Medellin cocaine cartel to protect U.S.-bound drug shipments.
   ``It's peculiar on its face,'' Lehtinen said. ``But it's the
same tension that is always apparent when the government believes a
person is guilty, yet still has a right to a fair trial.''
   Noriega spurned a deal to give up power in exchange for
dismissal of his February 1988 indictments. His capture - complete
with red underwear purportedly to ward off the ``evil eye,''
suspected cocaine that turned out to be tamale powder, and rock 'n'
roll music blared into the Vatican Embassy - resulted from an
invasion the defense tried to have ruled illegal.
   But the defense won a battle to prove Noriega was a prisoner of
war, entitling him to wear his uniform in court and receive a Red
Cross allotment. When the United States opposed initial efforts to
unfreeze the accounts because they were drug-tainted, the defense
responded by saying Noriega had received $11 million from U.S.
intelligence agencies.
   U.S. immigration officials then revealed they had enough
evidence to indict Noriega for alien smuggling as soon as his drug
trial was over, prompting a horrified U.S. attorney's office to
announce no such indictment was planned.
   Michael O'Kane, an attorney for co-defendant Daniel Miranda,
angered Noriega's lawyers when he sued the former Panamanian leader
on behalf of two photographers injured during the U.S. invasion.
The combative O'Kane also produced document logs that suggested the
U.S. government had removed some secret documents from files
confiscated in Panama, a charge the government has denied.
   Noriega's quarters at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside of Miami aroused ire in Congress when it was revealed he
had an exercise bicycle, a phone, a telecopier and a computer.
   Prison officials said security requirements made it cheaper to
outfit the cell than move Noriega, who has the right to visit with
attorneys and to exercise. Federal marshals have spent more than
$360,000 on security and transportation for Noriega, The Miami
Herald reported last week.
   Perhaps the biggest flap came over Noriega's taped prison phone
conversations, some of which were telecast by Cable News Network.
Hoeveler ordered the network to stop, an order the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed to remain in force until the judge examined the tapes
and decided they were harmless to the defense. CNN still faces
possible contempt penalties in that case.
   Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, launched their own investigation
of the leaked tapes, determining that one of their potential
witnesses, former Noriega intelligence chief Jose Blandon, was
responsible. He faces possible charges in the case.

<HEAD>`Ghost' Is 1990's Biggest Hit; Battle Continues For Third Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The supernatural drama ``Ghost'' is
materializing as the year's most popular movie, but there's still a
fight for third place as ``Home Alone'' continues to draw packed
houses.
   According to figures compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
through Dec. 25, ``Ghost'' made $202.8 million at North American
theaters in 1990 to claim the top spot. The film, starring Demi
Moore and Patrick Swayze, also is the 11th highest-grossing release
in movie history.
   Second place was nailed down by the prostitution comedy ``Pretty
Woman'' with receipts of $178.4 million.
   Final year-end figures will be released on Wednesday, with
fifth-place ``Home Alone'' starring 10-year-old Macaulay Culkin
likely to move up to third.
   As of Christmas, the third-place release was the pizza-eating
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' on ticket sales of $133 million.
   Fourth went to the Cold War thriller ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' with a gate of $120.7 million. And ``Home Alone''
temporarily sat in fifth with $118.6 million.
   Arnold Schwarzenegger's time-traveling ``Total Recall'' finished
sixth with a gate of $118.3 million. In seventh with $115.3 million
in the bank was Bruce Willis in ``Die Hard 2.'' Eighth was taken by
Warren Beatty's ``Dick Tracy,'' which made $103.7 million.
   The year's No. 9 film was Michael J. Fox in ``Back to the Future
Part III'' on grosses of $87.6 million. The last spot in the Top 10
went to the courtroom drama ``Presumed Innocent,'' with a turnstile
take of $86.3 million.
   Among the year's biggest flops were Jack Nicholson's ``The Two
Jakes,'' an expensive sequel to ``Chinatown'' that made only $9.9
million. Chuck Norris' ``Delta Force 2'' collected just $6.2
million and Diane Keaton's ``The Lemon Sisters'' realized a tart
$3.4 million.
   Two recent holiday releases may prove to be box-office bombs,
too. Robert Redford's ``Havana'' opened terribly, and director
Brian De Palma's adaptation of ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' is being
crushed by deadly reviews.
   The annual box-office take for all films through Christmas was
$4.716 billion, just behind 1989's record-setting pace of $4.786
billion.
   The winners list among 1989 releases was headed by ``Batman''
and followed by ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Lethal
Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's
Talking.''

<HEAD>New Taxes, Recycling and Drug Laws Take Effect in New Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New Year's Day brings new laws aimed at keeping criminals from
buying rifles in California, lobbyists from lavishing gifts on
politicians in Florida and landfills from overflowing in
Connecticut and Wisconsin.
   The federal government already is raising alcohol and cigarette
taxes and the top income-tax rate on Jan. 1. But the tax burden is
going up even more in some states, particularly New Jersey, which
has a $1.3 billion income tax hike tied to a school financing
overhaul.
   Washington state hopes to smoke out $18 million a year with a
$10 a pack penalty on untaxed cigarettes, often illegally bought by
non-Indians on Indian reservations.
   Delaware is increasing cigarette taxes 5 cents a pack and gas
taxes 3 cents a gallon. Motorists in Massachusetts and Florida face
a 4-cent increase. Just a month ago, the federal government got a
nickel-a-gallon gas tax increase.
   Californians will see their sales tax drop by a quarter-cent
with the expiration of a revenue raiser for earthquake repairs. But
gas taxes go up a penny, in what will become a New Year's tradition
through 1994.
   Indiana is going to cut a tax. The motor vehicle excise tax was
so unpopular that thousands crossed state lines to avoid it. On a
new car worth $15,000, the first-year tax will drop from $413 to
$289.
   Several new laws deal with crime, corruption and drugs.
   California becomes the first state to require a waiting period
and a police background check to buy rifles and shotguns.
   ``In 1991, there will be people who would have died a violent
death who won't die,'' Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly said.
   Another California law allows courts to suspend the driver's
license or future driving privilege of anyone older than 13
convicted of graffiti vandalism.
   New Hampshire and Illinois laws authorize longer sentences for
``hate crimes'' such as those motivated by the victim's religion,
race or sexual preference.
   Florida is banning state legislators and some 30,000 other
public officials from soliciting or accepting any gift over $100
from a lobbyist, a lobbyist's employer or a political action
committee.
   Maryland will try reducing the demand for drugs by suspending
users' professional and business licenses. Gov. William Donald
Schaefer's drug program requires courts to notify licensing boards,
which can suspend the license or impose probation with a
requirement of drug tests or treatment programs.
   New Hampshire will let judges revoke driver's licenses for up to
life upon conviction of possession with intent to sell drugs.
   South Carolina is requiring those who do substantial business
with the state to certify they will provide a drug-free workplace.
   Nebraska is trying to stamp out drugs by imposing taxes, ranging
upward from $100 an ounce on marijuana. Many other states already
have tried this tact, which gives authorities another way to
prosecute and fine drug dealers who fail to obtain and affix the
appropriate tax stamp to illicit items.
   Several new laws are aimed at better waste disposal.
   Connecticut's recycling law requires trash collectors to report
any residents and businesses who fail to separate corrugated
cardboard, newspapers, office paper, glass and metal food
containers, leaves, scrap metal, car batteries and waste oil for
recycling.
   Wisconsin is phasing in mandatory recycling. Phase one prohibits
disposing of car batteries, waste oil or major appliances in
landfills or incinerators. Indiana is requiring stores that sell
automotive batteries to accept customers' used batteries for
recycling.
   Virginia is providing an income tax credit for businesses that
buy machinery used for recycling.
   Michigan is attacking the problem of tire dumps, which have been
sites of major fires and Asian Tiger mosquito infestations. The law
will require scrap tire haulers and collection sites to register
with the state.
   Tennessee is imposing a $250 fine for anyone releasing more than
24 balloons of the non-biodegradable kind that choke sea animals.
Some lawmakers who feel the measure is full of hot air calculated
that a crowd in the University of Tennessee's 95,000-seat football
stadium could still legally release about 2.3 million balloons.
   In other measures:
   - Louisiana is cutting the waiting time for a divorce in half by
no longer requiring a six-month separation before a couple files
for divorce. ``Our attempts to legislate morality in the divorce
process have been unsuccessful. We were the only state left in the
nation with the institution of legal separation,'' Rep. Allen
Bradley said.
   - Hawaii is opening adoption records to adoptees who reach age
18, unless one of their biological parents does not want to be
identified. The birth parents would have to restate every five
years their desire to keep the records closed.
   - Shoppers in Maine can go to malls and large stores on Sunday
year-round as a result of an initiative approved by voters in
November. The old ``blue law'' had so many loopholes that opponents
attacked its fairness.

<HEAD>Bush Has `Gut Feeling' Saddam will Withdraw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he has a ``gut feeling''
that Iraq's Saddam Hussein will withdraw from Kuwait, even at risk
of being toppled from power by his own people.
   Bush, in a Time magazine interview to be published Monday, also
said he was confident he had chosen the right course in the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``Maybe that is why I am - I will not say relaxed, but
determined. And I am not churning about it,'' he said.
   Speculation about Bush's state of mind has been growing as the
United Nation's Jan. 15 deadline nears for Iraq's pullout from
Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has authorized the United States
and its allies to use force after that date if Iraq refuses to get
out.
   Bush was spending the weekend at his Camp David lodge in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, about 60 miles northwest of the
capital, with his brother Jonathan and his family. Vice President
Dan Quayle, meanwhile, was headed for Saudi Arabia to spend New
Year's Day with U.S. troops and to consult with Saudi leaders and
the exiled emir of Kuwait.
   Quayle's staff said he bore no new diplomatic initiatives from
Bush.
   At Camp David, the president reviewed reports on the gulf crisis
Saturday and signed an executive order that implemented his
decision to grant the Soviet Union up to $1 billion in credits to
buy farm products from the United States.
   In signing the order, Bush waived the 1974 Jackson-Vanik
amendment, which barred aid to communist governments unless they
allowed free emigration. Bush had announced on Dec. 12 that he
would lift the ban until June 1991 because the Soviets were
allowing unprecedented numbers of Jews to leave for Israel.
   The Soviets asked for the farm aid to help them overcome severe
food shortages. Moscow also will be entitled to buy up to $300
million in U.S. manufactured goods on credit.
   Asked whether he had made the decision to sacrifice American
lives to implement the U.N. resolution against Iraq, Bush bristled
in the Time interview.
   ``No, I am not willing to sacrifice American lives. I do not
like the question put that way.''
   But he also said he was determined to do whatever was necessary
to get Iraq out. ``That includes every inch of territory. No
concessions.''
   Asked whether that means going to war, Bush answered:
   ``My gut says he will get out of there. But that flies in the
face of what some of the Arab leaders tell me - which is that he
cannot get out. ... He cannot do it and survive domestically.''
   Nonetheless, Bush added, anyone who has fought a war ``is going
to have to find a way to see that he does not fight another one.''
Saddam fought an eight-year war with Iran which ended in 1988 with
some 1 million casualties on both sides.
   Bush himself was a young flyer in World War II and saw action
against Japan in the Pacific.
   Bush, or rather ``the two faces of President Bush,'' was chosen
as Time's Man of the Year and will be featured on the magazine's
front cover that hits the newsstands Monday. His interview with the
magazine was on Dec. 20 at the White House.
   The annual distinction features a woman or man deemed to have
made the most impact on the year's events.
   On foreign policy, Bush ``was a study in resoluteness and
mastery'' while domestically he was ``just as strongly marked by
wavering and confusion,'' Time said.
   Praising his ability to form and lead an international coalition
against Iraq but claiming he was unable to lead in similar fashion
on domestic issues, Time asked Bush for an explanation.
   ``There is a very simple one. We don't control either house of
Congress,'' where Democrats far outnumber Republicans, he said. On
domestic matters, ``to accomplish things, you have to first beat
down the Democrats. And that is not true in foreign affairs.''
   Bush said his administration could boast of some domestic gains,
but conceded much remained to be done. Among his goals for the
coming year he listed improving the country's education programs,
speeding progress on fighting drug abuse, passing a strong
anti-crime bill and a new civil rights bill to replace the one Bush
vetoed this year.
   But the president may also be in for a fight on foreign policy,
because Democrats assert he must get congressional approval before
he orders U.S. troops to fight. Bush is expected to meet with the
congressional leadership next Thursday, when the new Congress will
be sworn in.

<HEAD>Police Say Youth Dies in Argument About Spending Night at Friend's

<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old is accused of stabbing a
friend with a piece of glass and leaving him to bleed to death
after a fight over whether the friend should sleep at his house.
   Police booked the youth with manslaughter of Patrick O'Neal
Haney, also 16. The accused teen's name was not released because he
is a juvenile, Cpl. Kevin Cavell said.
   He said police believe the fight began because Haney wanted to
spend the night at his friend's house and wouldn't take no for an
answer.
   A police officer found Haney shortly after 2 a.m. Friday, about
the same time someone called police to report the victim was lying
in blood on the steps of a house, Cavell said. Before a rescue
squad arrived, Haney had bled to death, Cavell said.
   Haney's cousin, Michael Stewart, 22, said he had been with Haney
earlier the night he died, and believed there had to be more to the
story than policereleased. He said Haney and the accused youth
grew up together and had been good friends.

   Filmmaker George Romero, an idol of horror
film aficionados, has been selected as Pittsburgh Magazine's
Pittsburgher of the Year.
   The magazine hails the director of the cult classic ``Night of
the Living Dead'' as ``the man who got us into the movies'' on the
cover of its January issue.
   The 50-year-old Romero invested $600 to make the 1968
black-and-white original and was involved in an expensive color
remake of that film this year. Both films were shot in the
Pittsburgh area and the remake premiered in the city last fall.
   He currently is directing Timothy Hutton in ``The Dark Half,'' a
film from the Stephen King novel of the same name. The movie is
being shot in nearby Washington County.
   Romero is credited with making Pittsburgh an alternative site
for film makers. Nine movies were made in Pittsburgh in 1990,
bringing in $30 million to the local economy.
   ``People used to call me crazy when I said, well, we'll make
these movies right in Pittsburgh,'' Romero said. ``And now ...
there are more and more films being made here, and now, I can't get
out of here, it seems.''

   LONDON (AP) - The Pointer Sisters, en route to the United States
on Saturday after visiting troops in the Persian Gulf, praised the
dedication of forces stationed there.
   The sisters, Anita, June and Ruth, performed for servicemen
aboard U.S. Navy ships and starred in a concert with comedian Bob
Hope at a Bahrain army base during the visit, which lasted from
Christmas Day till Friday.
   ``I felt so honored to be lifting spirits, to be able to give
the troops a charge of love,'' said June Pointer, speaking by
telephone Saturday from a transit lounge at London's Heathrow
airport, where the soul trio was waiting for a flight to Los
Angeles.
   ``They are all homesick but they are very serious about doing
the job they were sent there to do.''
   ``The guys seemed really excited to see someone from home,''
said Anita Pointer. ``It helps the morale of all the troops to see
people are supporting them.
   ``Most really want to go home. But they are determined to get
the job done.''
   The sisters were unable to visit Saudi Arabia with Hope because
that country objects to female entertainers.
   Their performances will be part of a Bob Hope TV special, also
featuring singer Marie Osmond, Jan. 12 on NBC.

   ROME (AP) - As countless Italians are doing in Italy's first
good ski season in three years, Pope John Paul II slipped away to
the slopes during the holidays for a few runs.
   Italian state television reported Saturday that the pope spent
five hours Friday on a slope rated medium in difficulty at Campo
Felice, a popular ski area in the Abruzzo region, about a 90-minute
drive from Rome. The 70-year-old pontiff was an avid skier and
mountain hiker in his younger days in southern Poland.
   His first known ski trip as pope, in the mid-1980s, drew lots of
media attention, but his latest surprise outing drew little notice.

   HONOLULU (AP) - The crackdown by Honolulu police on speeders
means everybody, even the guy who rides around in a black limousine
bearing license number ``1.''
   Gov. John Waihee's chauffeur got a ticket Friday accusing him of
whizzing along at 65 mph in a 55 mph zone on the H-1 Freeway in
Oahu.
   Waihee was a passenger in the limousine at the time.
   Fellow officers say motorcycle officer Albert Kaalele made the
nab. And it's not surprising, they say, because Kaalele has been
known to ticket fellow police officers.
   Police Chief Michael Nakamura, who announced the crackdown on
speeders Dec. 10, had one response when he heard about the ticket:
``Good.''

<BYLINE>After Cruzan: `It's Time to Get Back to Normal'

<TEXT>
   Joe Cruzan didn't want his daughter to
become the focus of a national debate. But she did.
   Anti-euthanasia activists didn't want Nancy Cruzan's
life-sustaining feeding tube removed. But it was.
   Town leaders didn't want their cozy Ozarks community, which
promotes its fall ``Apple Butter Makin' Days,'' to become a news
dateline about protests against stopping Ms. Cruzan's food and
water. But it did.
   No one got what he or she wanted out of Nancy Cruzan's sad saga.
   Joe Cruzan did get a court decision allowing for the removal of
his daughter's feeding tube removed, but he said after her funeral
Friday: ``I would prefer to let my daughter die and let somebody
else be this trailblazer. Our courage came from the young lady we
just buried.''
   For him, there will be no more one-sided conversations with his
33-year-old daughter, who died Wednesday after spending nearly
eight years in a vegetative state because of a devastating car
crash.
   He used to sit in Ms. Cruzan's quiet room at the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center here, talking to her about legal action,
updating family news, explaining why he wanted to help her life
end.
   Encouragement came from supportive letters.
   ``The letters have just been pouring in,'' Cruzan said. ``The
biggest part of the people support us. I'm thankful and appreciate
that.''
   Now, the Cruzan family wants privacy and rest.
   Their home telephone number has been changed. No longer will
they make the drive from Carterville to Mount Vernon that helped
put 38,000 miles on a 2-year-old car. Cruzan says the vehicle is on
its third tape deck, so often have his daughter's favorite songs
been played during the drive.
   ``To the ones who maybe didn't understand or didn't agree, we
did what we felt we had to do,'' Cruzan said. ``We appreciate their
prayers.''
   Those who didn't agree converged on Mount Vernon as Ms. Cruzan
was dying. They camped at the state-run hospital, carrying signs
urging the Cruzans to reconnect the feeding tube. Some spent days
in custody after trying to enter Ms. Cruzan's room, identifying
themselves only as ``Nancy Cruzan.''
   The demonstrators from Wisconsin, Minnesota, Georgia and other
states, ``should have been run out of town on a rail,'' said Gene
Burk, a barber for 24 years in Mount Vernon.
   ``That family has gone through eight years of pure hell,'' he
said between haircuts Friday at his shop near the county square.
``It was a really sad situation. I think the town is ready for it
to be over.''
   Opponents of removing Ms. Cruzan's food and water went to state
and federal courts, but failed in their efforts to reconnect it.
One warned that the state had slipped ``a big notch closer to
hell'' because of the tube's removal.
   Kathy Fairchild, president-elect of the Mount Vernon Chamber of
Commerce, was more immediately concerned about her town's image
than Missouri's status in the hereafter.
   Editor of the weekly Lawrence County Record, she was soliciting
support Friday for an advertisement commending efforts of the
hospital, whose 465-person payroll makes it Mount Vernon's largest
employer.
   The ad omits mention the Cruzan case.
   ``But sure, that's the inspiration. It's disgusting to have all
this attention and to have our friends and neighbors called
murderers,'' Ms. Fairchild said Friday.
   ``It's time to get back to normal. It's like our paper said in
an editorial: `We're ready to drop off the map.'''

   In the wake of Nancy Cruzan's death,
combatants over the right to die are ready for fresh debate in the
Missouri Legislature.
   Ms. Cruzan, who died Wednesday at age 33, had been hospitalized
with no hope of recovery since a 1983 car wreck. Her parents tried
since 1987 to have the woman's life-sustaining feeding tube removed
so she could die, arguing they believed she would prefer not to
live as she was.
   Finally, after a legal fight that went to the U.S. Supreme
Court, the family got what it sought. A judge subsequently ruled
that the family had presented ``clear and convincing'' evidence -
the standard set for Missouri by the Supreme Court - that Ms.
Cruzan would not want to live in a persistent vegetative state.
   The years of litigation were prompted partly because Ms. Cruzan
left no written instructions about how to handle her incapacity.
   With the Cruzan case in mind, state Sen. Bob Johnson is
sponsoring a ``health care surrogate bill'' that he says would
prevent others in Missouri from having to face the same legal
ordeal. He failed in a bid to get similar legislation passed in the
last session.
   His bill would allow a person to sign legal documents
designating one or more people - family or friends - to make any
health care decision when the person becomes incapacitated. Their
advance instructions could include approving withdrawal of food and
water.
   Johnson said this would more than meet the legal standard of
``clear and convincing'' evidence.
   ``If you sign this document, there's no question that you
wouldn't have to go through what the Cruzans faced because it would
be out of the court system,'' he said.
   Missouri law currently has only the Living Will Statute, which
allows a person to leave written instructions about medical care.
But it applies only when the person is in a terminal condition, and
specifically excludes withdrawal of food and water to a patient.
   ``This is not a euthanasia bill. This is not designed to induce
the painless death of a person. It's to be used in cases where
there is no chance of recovery,'' Johnson said, recalling arguments
against the measure.
   Johnson's bill in the last legislative session faced opposition
led by the Missouri Catholic Conference, among others. It was
weakened over several weeks amid allegations that it authorized
euthanasia.
   Finally, with little of the measure's original intent intact,
Johnson spiked it for the year.
   Lou DeFeo, the Catholic Conference lobbyist who organized
opposition to Johnson's bill, said he'll be back in 1991 to work
against it.
   ``The major defect is there are no safeguards for a vulnerable
person, and the persons most in need are the ones who will be the
most vulnerable,'' DeFeo says. ``There's no balancing or protection
by the family. The surrogate could be a total stranger.''
   Johnson said opponents were better organized than supporters of
his measure, but he promises that will change in the upcoming
session.
   Among the supporters: the Missouri Bar, the organization for the
state's lawyers, whose lobbyists have pledged to work the hallways
along with senior citizens groups, he said.

<HEAD>INS Plans Crossing Fee For Express Lanes to Mexico, Canada</HEAD>

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service
plans to establish express lanes at certain border crossings to
Mexico and Canada - and charge for the expedited service.
   According to INS spokesman Verne Jervis, the agency will
inaugurate the system sometime in 1991. Express-lane locations and
the amount of the fee have yet to be decided, he said.
   Supporters of a border-crossing toll say the INS' proposal is a
start, but that the agency has room under legislation passed by
Congress this year to adopt a more ambitious fee program to pay for
improved border security.
   ``They have an opportunity for an aggressive, intelligent
program, and the results could provide for a permanent, effective
financing vehicle for sound border security, and they're ducking
for cover already,'' said Dan Stein, executive director of the
Federation for American Immigration Reform.
   Hispanic rights activists, however, questioned the precedent of
establishing any fee, even if optional, for crossing the U.S.
border. Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza expressed
discomfort about ``paying to get into a country. ... We're living
in an age when walls are coming down in other parts of the world
and yet the United States is considering a fee for coming in.''
   And she questioned whether INS can handle another new program
given its current management and financial woes. The General
Accounting Office, in a recent draft report on the agency, was
harshly critical of the agency's administration and budget process.
   Jervis, in an interview Friday, said that under the
express-crossing program, users who pay the fee would be given a
document or decal entitling them to quicker inspections. The fees
would be used solely to finance the program, and would come on top
of the bridge tolls already charged at some crossings.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the INS has
critical shortages of inspector staff at the largest border
crossings. Waits of several hours are not uncommon for travelers at
some of the large land border crossings, GAO said.
   In addition, GAO said, INS faces a ``significant and unnecessary
degree of potential fraud due to inadequate controls over nearly
$300 million in annual fee revenue.''
   Jervis, however, said the agency would not be tackling a new
program ``if we didn't think we could handle it.''
   Ms. Munoz said a border-crossing fee also has the potential of
operating like a regressive tax, hitting hardest those least able
to afford the cost - poorer residents of the Southwest who travel
frequently between the United States and Mexico visiting relatives,
those who commute legally over the border, or who have businesses
in both countries.
   But FAIR, which proposed a border-crossing fee two years ago,
said quicker inspections funded by a toll would be a boon to
commerce in border communities.
   ``The biggest detriment to trans-border commerce is the two to
three-hour wait currently encountered in cross-border excursions,''
Stein said. ``Those who are crossing the border for legitimate
reasons will be more than happy to pay for better and faster
inspections. Time is money.''
   Stein said a toll of $2 would increase the service's budget by
50 percent.
   The additional money and manpower could also be used to help
control drug smuggling and violence on the border, Stein said.
   ``We want to get the border under control and this is a place to
get the money,'' Stein said. ``But I'm not sure the Justice
Department has the political guts to do anything along these lines.
The administration of (Attorney General Dick) Thornburgh has been
characterized by an overriding desire to avoid controversy.'' The
INS is part of the Justice Department.

<HEAD>Former Hostage Keeps Diary of Survival in War-Ravaged Kuwait</HEAD>

   Dr. James Carroll witnessed the devastation
wrought in Kuwait by Iraqi soldiers and recorded the events in a
diary that he hoped would be delivered to his wife if he lost his
life.
   Carroll, a pediatric neurologist at the Medical College of
Georgia, delivered the diary to her in person after his Dec. 6
release. He was among hostages freed when Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein declared that all foreigners could leave the region.
   The Augusta Chronicle published Carroll's diary in Sunday's
edition.
   Carroll was starting his third year working at Kuwait University
in Kuwait City when Iraq took over the country Aug. 2.
   He spent the next four months first hiding among Kuwaiti friends
and then caring for the people remaining at the American Embassy
until they were freed.
   He didn't believe he would make it out of the Middle East alive,
and intended the diary be given to his wife, Shirley.
   His account began the day of the invasion when a Sudanese friend
phoned to tell Carroll, ``Doctor, don't go outside. ... There is
war.''
   Carroll continued to hide from Iraqi soldiers because of
Saddam's use of foreigners as human shields. But he was able to
describe the toll the invasion and occupation took on Kuwait City.
   ``Day after day, huge flatbed trucks go by the Embassy with
goods of all kinds,'' he wrote on Sept. 1. ``The Iraqis clear out
entire apartment buildings by kicking in doors and evicting or
capturing the occupants. Then they bring the trucks in and load
everything. They even remove the wiring.''
   Carroll twice was invited to flee across the desert with
friends, some who said they had an escape route provided by the
CIA. Both times, he declined, citing the high risk. Both groups
failed.
   When Saddam threatened to execute Kuwaitis caught harboring
foreigners, Carroll fled to the American Embassy, where a depleted
staff was battling to stay open with phone lines cut and food and
water deliveries stopped by the Iraqis.
   Carroll described a hot, boring routine of exercise, digging a
well, eating canned tuna, and standing guard duty.
   ``There is no danger on guard duty: We are here only to notify
everyone if the Iraqis decide to come in,'' he wrote. ``We have no
way to stop them.
   ``I am sitting here looking at the U.S. flag flapping in the
breeze. This must be a real affront to the Iraqis. If they come in
here, I think war might be touched off. Probably, they think the
same.''
   Carroll had no diplomatic passport and so was afraid to leave
the embassy compound. He left once, to take to a hospital a woman
who had broken her hip in a car accident while trying to flee
across the desert.
   ``Somehow, God got us through four Iraqi checkpoints,'' he
wrote. ``The soldiers requested the documents of the driver, who
had a diplomatic passport, but never asked for mine.''
   He also wrote of being glad that his wife and seven children
were safe. The family was to have rejoined him in Kuwait on Aug.
24.
   ``You and I are being tried in a most holy fire,'' Carroll wrote
his wife.
   Carroll was allowed to leave Kuwait on Dec. 9, but he didn't
allow himself to believe the news until he landed in Germany.
   ``We were so out of practice in hearing good news that we didn't
let ourselves get excited. Saddam had lied before and he would
certainly do it again.''
   As he left the embassy, Carroll described what he saw: ``Kuwait
had been transformed from a crowded metropolis to a deserted city
with trash strewn through the streets.''
   Carroll told the Augusta newspaper he believes the strife is
only beginning.
   ``I'd like to go back at some point to help them rebuild the
medical school,'' he said. ``But even if things clear up
miraculously over there, it won't be a safe place - suitable for
families - for a number of years.''

   Israeli gunners shelled Shiite Moslem
villages in the Syrian-policed Bekaa Valley on Saturday, killing
eight civilians, including four small children, police said. Nine
people were wounded.
   In Jerusalem, military officials confirmed the raid and said it
came after several Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel
and the occupied zone from the area around the villages.
   Israeli officials reported no casualties or damage from the
rockets.
   The Lebanese police said the villages of Mashgara, Sohmor,
Maydoun and Ein el-Tineh, 2 miles north of Israel's self-designated
``security zone,'' were hit by 50 shells in the midday barrage.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
three small children were among those killed.
   Three of the wounded civilians were in critical condition, the
spokesman said.
   Israel carved out the 440 square-mile security zone in 1985
after a three-year occupation of southern Lebanon.
   The zone is designed to protect Israel's northern border from
guerrilla infiltrations. It is patrolled jointly by Israel and the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, a mainly Christian force.
   The Palestinian news agency WAFA said Friday that Israel is
massing troops and placing mobile ``long-range surface-to-surface
missiles'' capable of reaching several Arab capitals along the
Lebanese border.
   The report said the deployment accompanied a troop buildup along
the border with Jordan in preparation for action with U.S. forces
in case of an attack against Iraq to force it out of occupied
Kuwait.
   Israeli Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron denied Friday that
Israel is massing troops along the Jordanian frontier.
   The Israeli military command declined comment on the reports of
a buildup on the Lebanese border, saying it does not respond to
reports concerning troop movements.

<HEAD>Five Arabs Killed, At Least 90 Injured In Clashes With Troops</HEAD>

   Israeli troops shot and killed five
Palestinians and wounded at least 90 people in clashes in the
occupied Gaza Strip on Saturday, Israeli and Arab reports said.
   The clashes were the bloodiest in Gaza since a wave of riots
that swept through the seaside strip in May.
   Estimates of the number of wounded Saturday ranged as high as
182.
   The worst violence occurred in the Rafah refugee camp after an
Israeli military patrol encountered a group of masked Arab
activists.
   The army said the soldiers ordered the Palestinians to stop and
when they refused, opened fire, killing two. Palestinian
journalists said the soldiers fired when the activists refused to
stop writing slogans on a wall.
   The army said the activists were carrying ``cold'' weapons. It
did not elaborate but the term refers to weapons that are not
firearms, such as sticks, knives and chains.
   The dead activists were identified as Osama Ismail el-Bulbeisi,
16, and Islam Harb, 19. Arab accounts said both were shot in the
head.
   News of the deaths spread in the refugee camp, and an angry
Palestinian mob pelted soldiers with stones. The army said there
were ``mass violations of order'' and that the patrol commander, a
2nd lieutenant, was injured in the face.
   Palestinians hurled at least 26 firebombs at the troops, and the
soldiers opened fire again after finding themselves in a
life-threatening situation, the army said. Two Arabs were killed in
that shooting, it said.
   Palestinian journalists identified them as Hisham Abu Harb and
Fawsi Eisa, both 19.
   The military also said a Palestinian woman from Rafah was
brought dead to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Yunis. It said the
cause of her death was unclear but the army included her in the
overall toll of Palestinians injured or killed by army gunfire.
   The deaths brought to 785 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops or civilians in the uprising against Israeli rule of
the Gaza Strip and West Bank. An additional 322 Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel. Fifty-seven Israelis have also been slain.
   According to the military command, 60 people were wounded in the
clashes in Rafah and nine were were hospitalized. Israel radio put
the number of wounded in the confrontation at 100.
   The Arab-run Jerusalem Media and Communications Center and Arab
reports from Rafah said 152 people were treated at the United
Nations clinic there and that 30 were in serious condition.
   Rafah is known as a base of hard-core uprising activists who
have killed at least 23 fellow Arabs on suspicion of helping Israel
in the last seven months.
   The last time Gaza was the site of such violence was following
the May 20 killing of seven Gaza laborers by an Israeli gunman near
Tel Aviv. In three days of rioting, Israeli troops shot to death 12
Palestinians and wounded hundreds.
   Earlier Saturday, the military reported ``local disturbances''
in the Gaza refugee camps of Jabaliya and Khan Yunis.
   It was not known whether troops opened fire in Jabaliya; there
were no reports of injuries in the camp.
   In Khan Yunis, clashes broke out after an army patrol trying to
clear a road barricade came under a barrage of rocks thrown by
Arabs from mosque and house rooftops, said Arab reporters based in
Gaza.
   The army said three firebombs were hurled at soldiers, who then
opened fire.
   The army quoted Nasser Hospital officials as saying they treated
30 Palestinians for gunshot and other injuries.
   Israeli officials have predicted a surge in the 3-year-old
Palestinian uprising surrounding this week's ``Fatah Day.''
   Tuesday marks the 26th anniversary of the first anti-Israeli
attack by Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.

   President Lech Walesa on Saturday
nominated as his prime minister a little-known businessman who
promised to continue painful economic reforms aimed at achieving a
market economy.
   The selection of Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, 39, ended weeks of
speculation about who would succeed Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, now serving in a caretaker capacity.
   Parliament was to consider the nomination on Friday. Bielecki
would serve until parliamentary elections, which are to be held
sometime next year.
   Bielecki, a parliament deputy from Gdansk and head of a
consulting company, was once part of the Solidarity underground. He
is a leader of the Liberal-Democratic Congress, a small political
party devoted to development of private enterprise in Poland.
   The choice appeared aimed at underscoring Walesa's commitment to
continuing the difficult transition to a market economy after four
decades of Communist rule. The switchover has caused Poles
considerable economic hardship.
   ``It (the nomination) should first of all be understood as the
president treating economic problems as the most important,'' the
bearded, graying Bielecki told reporters after his nomination was
announced.
   He said he expected to announce his proposed Cabinet within a
few days, combining people ``with a lot of experience'' with
``people as unknown as I am.''
   Walesa spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said talks on forming the
new government would resume after the president and Bielecki return
to Warsaw on Wednesday following the New Year's holiday.
   Walesa, as president, is head of state and commander of the
military. The prime minister heads the government on a day-to-day
basis.
   The selection of Bielecki followed a few false starts. Defense
lawyer Jan Olszewski withdrew from consideration for the prime
minister's job Dec. 18, saying he and Walesa disagreed over the
makeup of the government.
   Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister, was also a contender,
but he wanted to stay in his current post so he could concentrate
on economic reform, according to presidential spokesman Andrzej
Drzycimski.
   Balcerowicz is the chief architect of the shock economic reforms
now under way, which Bielecki said he would work to continue.
   The reforms, which took effect Jan. 1, call for large-scale
privatization and combined sharp rises in prices with an end of
state subsidies on most goods.
   Mazowiecki's announcement that he would quit as prime minister
came one day after he was eliminated from the presidential race in
Nov. 25 balloting, finishing behind Walesa and emigre businessman
Stanislaw Tyminski. Walesa went on to beat Tyminski in a runoff.
   Mazowiecki, who differed with Walesa over the pace of economic
reform, refused his former ally's request that he stay on until the
parliamentary elections.
   Parliament, which is still dominated by former Communists or
their former allies elected in a partially rigged 1989 vote, has
said it will decide by March 1 when to dissolve.
   Vice Adm. Piotr Kolodziejcyzk said Saturday he would remain as
defense minister. But Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski, in
charge of police, declined an offer to stay, Walesa's spokesman
said.
   Bielecki on Dec. 20 had denied rumors that he was to be prime
minister, telling the state PAP news agency that he was not forming
a government. He was apparently tapped for the post after that.
   An early Solidarity activist, Bielecki was fired from a job as a
researcher in the field of management after the imposition of
martial law in 1981 because of his participation in a protest at
the Lenin Shipyard.
   Unemployed, he earned a living as a truck driver hauling lumber
while participating in the Solidarity underground.
   In 1985, he founded a private business consulting company called
Doradca, or Adviser, that hired professionals dismissed for their
Solidarity activities.

   Police on Saturday fired on thousands
of rioting prisoners demanding freedom, killing at least three and
wounding more than 90, prison officials said.
   At least 33 prison guards were injured, 12 of them hospitalized,
after prisoners stormed the prison's main gate with iron rods and
sticks, said a police spokesman who could not be identified under
briefing rules.
   About 5,000 convicts and detainees awaiting trial took part in
the riot at Dhaka Central Jail, and some tried to scale the walls,
a senior police official said on condition of anonymity.
   Police fired bullets and several tear gas shells. State
television said three prisoners were killed.
   The state BSS news agency said the riot was continuing late
Saturday, and some prison wardens were taken hostage. Hundreds of
police surrounded the prison.
   Prisoners later waved blood-stained shirts from the roofs and
threw two slips of paper with written messages for journalists
standing outside the prison compound.
   In one message, the prisoners claimed that 20 to 50 prisoners
were killed in police firing and between 100 and 300 were injured.
   The other message demanded that the prisoners be released
because their crimes were small compared to those of Kader
Siddiqui, an opposition political leader convicted of treason and
sentenced in absentia for 12 years in prison.
   Siddiqui, who fled to neighboring India after the assasination
of political ally President Sheik Mujibur Rahman in 1975, returned
to a hero's welcome this month.
   The unrest started Friday when some prisoners who were jailed
during the four years of martial law rule under former President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad protested their detention and demanded they
be released. Other prisoners joined in the protest.
   Ershad, a former army general, seized power in a 1982 coup and
imposed martial law uptil 1986. He was arrested and placed under
house arrest early this month following seven weeks of nationwide
protests.
   Police have charged Ershad and several former ministers with
corruption and abuse of power.
   Last week, the caretaker government that replaced Ershad freed
167 prisoners when it celebrated the nation's 19th year of
independence from Pakistan.

   A former judge who was convicted of corruption
has declared his candidacy for another 10-year term.
   The state Board of Elections received a copy of the declaration
Friday from Joseph O'Kicki, former president judge of Cambria
County. O'Kicki, 59, was sentenced to two to five years in prison
in June and stripped of his $80,000-a-year judgeship.
   He is free pending appeal, but faces trial again in March on 16
corruption counts that stem from personal business dealings. He
remains on the judicial payroll pending action by the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court.
   O'Kicki was convicted Dec. 16, 1989, of official oppression,
bribery and criminal coercion. O'Kicki made court employees chop
his wood and feed his dogs, solicited $500 from a court officer for
a promotion he never granted, sought payment from an attorney after
a damage award and demanded that a bank favorably settle his
personal loan, the jury found.
   O'Kicki filed notice Nov. 2 in Cambria County Common Pleas Court
that he intends to sue the parent company of The Wall Street
Journal. The case came to light last week when an attorney
representing Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., which publishes the New
York-based newspaper, had the case moved to U.S. District Court in
Pittsburgh.
   W. Thomas McGough Jr., local counsel for Dow Jones, speculated
in court papers that O'Kicki seemed to feel defamed by articles the
newspaper published about him.
   O'Kicki, of Johnstown, has no listed phone number there and
efforts to locate him for comment were unsuccessful.

<TEXT>
   Floods in Peru's central highlands killed six
people and left 12 missing and 500 families homeless, the civil
defense chief said Saturday. Radio reports put the death toll at 20
and said 50 were missing.
   The head of civil defense, Gen. Jorge Ferreyros, said in a
telephone interview that the number of deaths could climb as
floodwaters rose.
   The report on Radioprogramas said rescue workers were recovering
bodies from the turbulent waters of the River Shullcas outside the
central Andean city of Huancayo, a state capital 120 miles east of
Lima.
   Ferreyros said the river was already swollen by a week of heavy
rains when a landslide Friday night shook loose a wall of mud, rock
and ice from the Huaytapallana mountain, sending a wall of water
down the river.
   The floods washed away hundreds of ramshackle dwellings in the
shantytown of Santa Rosa de Lima on the river's edge. The landslide
was triggered by a tremor measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale, the
civil defense chief said.
   The Shullcas river has its source in a mountainous area 12 miles
northeast of Huancayo. Radioprogamas said the river's water level
was 20 yards above its usual level.
   Ferreyros said an air force plane left Lima Saturday with tents,
blankets, food and drinking water for homless families. The army
was working to move others to safety.
   The civil defense chief said thousands of other families living
on the riverbanks were still in danger.
   The rainy season in the central highlands began in early
December, ending a 13-month drought.

   A nurse suspected of murdering her young

stabbing them was killed Saturday when she opened several gas jets
and started a fire.
   The bodies of Lavelle Jernigan, 42, and Leonard Jernigan, 9,

put out the blaze at 7:15 a.m., Fire Marshal Bill Elliott said.
   The nurse's 20-year-old daughter, Teresa Jernigan, who is
pregnant, was found with multiple stab wounds about a block away
from the house in a ditch, Elliott said. She apparently ran from
the house after the mother began stabbing the three in their beds
with a butcher knife, police Lt. Keith Fletcher said.
   Authorities said they had no idea what led the mother to
violence. Lavelle Jernigan was an excellent nurse at Marshall
Memorial Hospital for 22 years, hospital administrator Jim Pears
said.
   Her husband, L.B. Jernigan, is an orderly at the hospital and
was working when the fire began, Pears said.
   Teresa Jernigan was listed in critical condition in Schumpert
Medical Center in Shreveport, La., nursing supervisor Cecilia
Thornton said. Officials did not know hen Ms. Jernigan's baby was
due.
   A 10-year-old daughter, Monique Jernigan, was found in the
doorway of the burning house with 18 stab wounds, Elliott said. She
was listed in critical condition in Marshall Memorial Hospital, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Elliott said Lavelle Jernigan apparently turned on gas jets on
the kitchen stove and a heating outlet in the children's bedroom
before lighting a pizza box, triggering a flash fire. She died from
heat and smoke inhalation, Elliott said.
   Authorities did not know whether the mother intended to kill
herself, Elliott said.
   Fire Lt. Aaron Younger said the fire was confined to a bedroom
where the mother and son were found and was put out in about 15
minutes.
   Teresa Jernigan, a Prairie View A&amp;M University student who was
home for the holidays, told authorities she and the other children
were stabbed by their mother, Elliott said.
   ``There were signs of some struggle and a lot of blood,''
Elliott said. ``There was some sheetrock broken where someone
apparently fell against the wall.''
   Elliott said the family had experienced recent financial
difficulties, but there was no indication why the woman would
attack her children.
   ``Her husband said they were not having marital problems,''
Fletcher said. ``It seems that she may have been suffering from
some type of depression.''
   The husband told police his wife acted normal Saturday morning.
   ``She got up and helped him get ready for work. In the next 30
minutes, all this had happened,'' Fletcher said.
   Elliott said the tragedy was the worst in Marshall since a Dec.
17, 1987, apartment fire that killed a family of seven about two
blocks from the Jernigan house.
   Marshall is about 140 miles east of Dallas in northeast Texas.

   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is sending
thousands more troops to bolster defenses on the border with Turkey
in the north - a potential second front in a Persian Gulf war.
   The Iraqi buildup is believed to include at least eight
divisions, including two armored divisions, or possibly more than
100,000 men, Asian diplomats in Baghdad said Saturday.
   The diplomats said the troops, backed by high-quality T-72
battlefront tanks and supported by paramilitary militias, are being
deployed along the 435-mile boundary to beef up defenses after
Turkey reinforced its army there.
   Iraqi media reported Friday that up to 300,000 paramilitary
troops in the Kurdish region have been reactivated as part of the
plan to shore up Iraq's northern defenses.
   In early November, the Iraqis were reported to have only about
40,000 men along the Turkish border.
   Although both sides have said they have no territorial ambitions
against the other, neither is taking chances. Turkey is a key ally
of the United States in its faceoff against Saddam.
   Turkish newspapers reported last week that the air force was
deploying several squadrons of F-4, F-5 and F-16 fighters in
southeastern Turkey and that 12,500 paratroopers and infrantrymen
would join an estimated 100,000 troops already along the border.
   Turkey has also requested that NATO send 42 jets for its defense
against possible Iraqi attack. Turkey wants the warplanes before
Jan. 15, the U.N. deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait or face attack
by a U.S.-led multinational force.
   The U.S. Air Force has several squadrons of long-range F-111
fighter bombers and F-16 interceptors deployed at Incirlik airbase
in southern Turkey.
   And Germany is considering sending air force planes and pilots
to Turkey. On Friday, Germany flew eight air force advisers there
to look into preparations for basing a jet force there within
weeks.
   None of this is lost on Saddam, whose main force is concentrated
along his southern border.
   About 500,000 Iraqi troops are massed in southern Iraq and
Kuwait, facing a comparable number in the multinational force in
Saudi Arabia and the gulf region.
   One Baghdad diplomat said that increasing Turkish pressure on
Iraq could ``revive the old Turkish dreams in northern Iraqi
provinces.''
   After the Ottoman Empire was divided up after World War I,
Turkey had claims against the province of Mosul and oil-rich Kirkuk
similar to the claims of Iraq on Kuwait. A large Turkoman
population is found in the northern provinces.
   Saddam also must keep an eye on Turkey's southern neighbor,
Syria, which has joined the Arab forces arrayed against Iraq with
19,000 troops in Saudi Arabia.
   President Hafez Assad is a bitter enemy of Saddam, who heads a
rival wing of the Arab Baath Socialist Party. Assad has an active
army of about 350,000 troops at home and 40,000 in Lebanon.
   Soon after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Saddam made a dramatic
move to secure his eastern front by making peace with Iran, giving
in to Tehran's demands for a permanent end to the 1980-1988 Persian
Gulf war.
   Since the U.N. Security Council voted on Nov. 29 to warn Saddam
he must leave Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face possible military action,
Saddam has called up reserves, shifted commanders and moved
divisions in ways that analysts say are clearly preparations for
war.
   Last week, Iraqi Interior Minister Samir Mouhamad Abdul-wahab
urged local chieftains in the Kurdish region to help confront a
possible military challenge in the north.
   The Kurdish chieftains, who supported the government during
Iraq's battle against Kurdish separatists in the 1980s, were
appointed as commanders of the National Defense Brigades, which
were defunct after Baghdad reached a cease-fire with Iran and
crushed the rebellion.
   Analysts said they numbered about 300,000.

<TEXT>
   Survivors of two women shot to death in a
northern Utah cabin burglary were urged at their joint funeral to
forgive the killers.
   More than 200 people crowded into the flower-bedecked Mormon
chapel in suburban Salt Lake on Friday for the services for
76-year-old Beth Harmon Tidwell Potts and her eldest daughter, Kaye
Tidwell Tiede, 51.
   The women were shot Dec. 22 at a family cabin about 45 miles
east of Salt Lake. Two men were charged in the killings.
   The mourners were asked to recall that Jesus' last words from
the cross were of forgiveness.
   ``It is painful to be the victim,'' said Mormon Bishop Bruce
Johnson, who presides over the congregation attended by Kaye Tiede
and her husband, Rolf, in Humble, Texas, a Houston suburb.
   ``But have you not learned how much more painful it is to be the
offender?'' Johnson asked.
   Rolf Tiede, who was shot twice in the face when he arrived at
the cabin later, led about 30 family members into the chapel. His
face was bandaged in several places and part of his head had been
shaved.
   Also in the family procession were Tiede's daughters, Linae, 20,
and Tricia, 16, who were kidnapped and briefly held hostage by the
assailants.
   Summit County officers arrested Von Lester Taylor, 25, and
Edward Steven Deli, 21, following a brief chase. They have been
charged with capital homicide, aggravated burglary, kidnapping,
arson and other felonies.
   The two victims were eulogized by family and friends as model
homemakers and parents.
   ``Mom and Kaye were not only mother and daughter, but were
friends,'' said Sue Ellen Tidwell, one of Mrs. Potts' three
surviving daughters.
   Mrs. Potts had been left partly blind and infirm in an
automobile accident that killed her second husband, but remained
the active matriarch of a family that included 19 grandchildren and
six great-grandchildren.
   ``The rest of us, well, sometimes we'd get short with mother
since the accident .... But Kaye would always point that out to
us,'' said Miss Tidwell.
   ``Her faith was so deeply entwined with her love that it made up
for all the other things in her life she never got to do,'' said
her son, Kenneth Eugene Tidwell.
   He also said his older sister, Mrs. Tiede, was a ``woman of
exemplary faith.''
   ``I think it is no accident that they went together,'' he said.

   Germany is considering sending air force
planes and pilots to Turkey in response to that nation's request
for NATO help in bolstering its defenses against Iraq.
   On Friday, the government flew eight air force advisers to
Turkey to check what preparations are necessary to base a 42-jet
force there within weeks. The unit is made up of 18 German, 18
Belgian and six Italian air force jets.
   The development comes as Germany is under international scrutiny
because of a limited contribution to the anti-Iraq coalition in the
Persian Gulf region and exports to Iraq before a U.N. embargo was
imposed.
   Turkey has requested deployment of the air unit by Jan. 15, the
U.N. deadline for Baghdad to pull out of Kuwait or face attack by a
U.S.-dominated multinational force.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government says Germany is not
considering a deployment of ground troops in Turkey, the only
country neighboring Iraq that is a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, a Western military alliance.
   ``Ground forces are absolutely not under discussion,'' said
government spokesman Dieter Vogel.
   Iraqi media has reported that Baghdad has reactivated up to
300,000 paramilitary troops to shore up defenses on the country's
northern border with Turkey - a possible second front if war breaks
out between Iraqi troops and the anti-Iraqi multinational force in
Saudi Arabia.
   Some Germans worry that sending a handful of air force pilots to
Turkey could lead to a larger German commitment.
   Germany's opposition Social Democrats have demanded Kohl turn
down the Turkish request.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, national leader of the Social Democrats,
instead demanded that Kohl's government launch an initiative to
seek a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.
   Hans-Christian Stroeble and Renate Dumas, leaders of the leftist
Greens Party, called on German troops to desert rather than face
fighting Iraq through deployment in Turkey.
   When tensions arose over Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
Germany avoided joining the anti-Iraq military deployment by saying
that sending troops to non-NATO turf would be a constitutional
violation.
   Instead, Germany agreed to help finance the efforts to isolate
Iraq, and to provide military equipment and logistical help in
moving supplies to the gulf. The total value of the promised
assistance amounts to about $2.2 billion.
   Nonetheless, criticism persists in Washington that Germany has
done too little to support the gulf cause.
   Germany has come under even closer scrutiny in the past two
weeks because of allegations that German firms had helped Iraq
advance its atomic technology. At least 100 German firms are
suspected of helping Iraq develop its unconventional weapons
capabilities.
   There have been reports that Iraq is anywhere from 2 to 10 years
from being able to construct an atomic bomb.
   NATO is expected to decide in early January whether to grant the
Turkish request. Kohl's government has not clearly stated its
position on the matter.
   But opposing a NATO decision to send the mobile force to Turkey
would raise severe doubts about Germany's loyalty to the alliance.
   Kohl's governing party, the Christian Democratic Union, leans
toward showing greater solidarity with Washington's gulf policies.
   Hans Stercken, chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs
committee and a prominent Christian Democrat, said all efforts must
be made to resolve the gulf crisis without a war.
   But he said ``(Germany's armed forces) and all other members of
the North Atlantic alliance'' would be ``obliged to repel'' an
attack on an alliance member such as Turkey.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Imposes a Sales Tax, Establishes Economic Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday ordered
the creation of a development fund and a 5 percent national sales
tax whose revenues would partly go to helping the poor and
stabilizing the ruble.
   Under powers granted him earlier this year by the national
Supreme Soviet legislature, Gorbachev can order emergency decrees
to carry out his plan to create a market economy.
   The latest decrees were not connected to the Soviet parliament
vote Thursday that strengthened Gorbachev's power over a
reorganized executive branch. That vote has brought accusations the
Soviet Union was moving toward a dictatorship.
   A Gorbachev aide was quoted Saturday as saying public debate and
scrutiny by the media and democratically elected lawmakers will
ensure the president does not abuse his strong new powers.
   ``The president's every move and word are discussed by the
people and the press in an ever more open manner, so we have got
the main remedy against dictatorship,'' Georgy Shakhnazarov told
Rabochaya Tribuna, or Workers Tribune, newspaper.
   The decrees announced Saturday appeared to show a sensitivity on
Gorbachev's part to the 15 republics' demands for more autonomy
from the federal government.
   Under the sales tax decree, 70 percent of the proceeds would go
to the republics, with the remainder for the federal government,
the state news agency Tass said. No such sales tax has existed in
the Soviet Union for years.
   ``The purpose ... is to provide financial resources for the
implementation of socio-economic programs adopted by the Soviet
parliament and the parliaments of the union republics, to support
the section of the population in the low income bracket, and to
stabilize the monetary system,'' Tass reported.
   The tax would be imposed on sales of ``production and
technological commodities, consumer goods, work and paid
services,'' Tass reported. It did not say when the tax would take
effect.
   There was no way immediately to determine how much revenue the
tax would generate.
   It would raise the 3-ruble price of a pack of Soviet cigarettes,
for example, by 15 kopeks. A kopek is a hundredth of a ruble. The
average Soviet monthly wage is only 257 rubles ($411 at the
official exchange rate).
   The division of revenues among national and republic governments
became a heated issue last week when the Russian parliament voted
to slash its contribution to the national government by roughly 85
percent next year.
   Gorbachev had said the move could cripple the government and had
pleaded with Russia to reverse the decision.
   Another of Saturday's decrees created a vaguely defined
``non-budget stabilization fund,'' to be created from sales of
state property and from existing taxes and other payments, Tass
said.
   It was created ``with the goal of providing a normal functioning
of the country's economy, of financial investments, of scientific
research and of other programs in the interest of all republics,
... and also for the support of companies that experience hardships
outside their own control during the transition to a market
economy,'' Tass reported.
   The decree ``recommended'' that republics create ``analogous
funds'' that could be consolidated into a single account before the
signing of proposed economic agreements between the republics and
the Kremlin.
   Shakhnazarov, in the newspaper interview, said the powers
granted Gorbachev on Thursday would not allow him to interfere in
areas under the republics' jurisdiction.
   ``If he oversteps the boundaries of his authority, republics
will be able to appeal against his actions,'' he said. He did not
explain how this would work.
   Late Friday, a group of reformist lawmakers issued a statement
warning the Soviet Union ``is heading toward dictatorship where the
key role is assigned to repressive bodies and violence could become
the major means of solving internal political issues.''
   Shakhnazarov said comparison of Gorbachev's powers to those of
former Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev or Josef Stalin were
``stupid.''
   ``We had none of the legislative structures we have now under
Stalin or under Brezhnev,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panama Names Noriega in Another Homicide Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama may ask the United States to extradite
Manuel Antonio Noriega to face possible charges in a second murder
case, the head of Panama's Supreme Court said.
   Also Friday, the United States signed an agreement with the
government of President Guillermo Endara to help train the
fledgling police force, which replaced Noriega's Defense Forces
that were defeated in the U.S. invasion a year ago.
   Court President Carlos Lucas Lopez said Friday that Noriega, in
a Florida prison awaiting trial on drug-trafficking charges, is
suspected of involvement in the 1985 death of Huga Spadafora.
   Panama's attorney general earlier asked the Foreign Ministry to
request Noriega's extradition to face charges in a homicide case
involving Maj. Moises Giroldi, who attempted a coup against Gen.
Noriega's rule in October 1989.
   The judge said the court has decided to hear charges against
Noriega in the Spadafora case and could solicit Noriega's
extradition from the United States.
   Spadafora fought with the leftist Sandinistas against
Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza regime of the 1970s and was later a
critic of Noriega in Panama.
   He was killed and decapitated along the Panama-Costa Rica
border. His attackers were never caught.
   Then-President Nicolas Ardito Barletta in 1985 refused to open
an inquiry into the case after the military, under Noriega, opposed
it.
   The court said it was also opening investigations into the
deaths of Carlos Efrain Guzman Baules, killed in an anti-Noriega
demonstration; of Marcos Alberto Rodriguez Justine, grandson of a
former Noriega aide; and of Carlos Rodriguez Justine, grandson of
former Col. Marcos Justine, a Noriega ally. Rodriguez was killed
this year.
   Panama filed a $6.5 billion damage suit against Noriega in U.S.
District Court in October, claiming he took part in assassination,
torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement, sale of
visas and passports and other abuses while chief of Panama's
Defense Forces.
   The United States and Panama signed an accord Friday providing
U.S. training and support for Panama's struggling, new civilian
police force. No cost was given for the program.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said the pact aims at
establishing ``a civilian police force with a high level of
professionalism that respects human rights and helps
institutionalize Panamanian democracy.''
   He and U.S. training program director Patrick Long signed the
accord at a ceremony attended by U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton.
   Panama replaced Noriega's military police with a civilian law
enforcement agency after Noriega's ouster.
   The accord allows the U.S. International Criminal Investigation
and Training Assistance Program to design police academies, provide
police training and funnel equipment into programs, a U.S. Embassy
communique said.
   U.S. police and Army Reservists have tried to help Panama
convert its corrupt 20-year-old military police system into an
effective civilian one, but many members are military men still
loyal to Noriega.
   Bank robberies, store holdups and prisoner escapes plague the
nation.
   The new 13,000-member agency has half the budget of its
16,000-member predecessor, the Defense Forces.
   Early this month, officers led by an escaped senior police chief
took over the police headquarters for several hours, protesting
their treatment by the government. They surrendered to U.S. and
loyal Panamanian forces.

   A $32 million judgment against a shipping company
has done little to improve pay for foreign sailors whose
substandard wages are hidden by false bookkeeping, attorneys and
industry chaplains said.
   The penalty against Delicia Shipping Co. was handed down in
August by U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner in Tacoma. Tanner found
the company intentionally underpaid 21 Filipino seamen who had
signed shipping articles promising higher wages under the Worldwide
International Transport Workers Federation Collective agreement.
   The decision, hailed as a victory for seamen, has become buried
in months of legal motions, petitions and appeals.
   Richard Dodson, a Baton Rouge, La., attorney for the seamen,
said none has seen a dollar from the case, and more than half have
been blacklisted in the industry and can't get work.
   Dodson said the case was pending before the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco, with several more motions and
hearings possible.
   ``If finally the seafarers win the case, then I think it's going
to have a very serious impact on the practice of double
bookkeeping, because most ship owners are just not going to be able
to afford that kind of penalty,'' said Paul Chapman of the New
York-based Seamen's Church Institute.
   Double bookkeeping refers to the practice of keeping two sets of
financial records. One is shown to in-port union inspectors to
indicate that sailors are being paid the negotiated, standard
wages. The other shows their actual pay, sometimes as little as
one-fifth of the first figure.
   U.S. law gives federal courts jurisdiction over wage cases
involving foreign vessels and crews when their voyages end in U.S.
waters.
   The Delicia case involved the Pine Forest, a ship flying the
flag of the South Pacific republic of Vanuatu, which requires that
sailors sign shipping articles promising the high union wages. The
sailors did not get that pay, but each month were required to sign
a voucher showing they had received it and sign a separate receipt
for their actual wages, Tanner found.
   Chapman said double bookkeeping remained widespread in the
shipping industry after the decision. He said Filipino sailors are
paid as little as $275 a month.
   The practice was defended by Joseph Stacey, an attorney for
Delicia, part of Inui Steamship Co. of Japan.
   ``Once the Filipino seaman is paid as much as the Japanese
seamen, they will just use Japanese sailors,'' he said.
   Low wags ``reflect the realities of the market,'' Stacey said.
   Most Filipino seamen are eager to work for the lower wage, and
some resisted the lawsuit brought by their co-workers, he asserted.
   Seamen's chaplains said the sailors are afraid to complain even
through they often are underfed and denied medical attention and
pay.
   ``They really have to be desperate before they speak. They all
know they would be out of work,'' said the Rev. Norris Stoa of the
Seattle Seamen's Center.
   The Rev. John Moes of the Seaman's Center Christian in Seattle
said he was glad the Pine Forest case focused attention on double
bookkeeping.
   He asserted that on many other ships, sailors work ``under
similar conditions, but they live in such fear to do anything.''
   No one at several seamen's centers in Seattle and Tacoma could
produce a Filipino seaman willing to talk about shipboard
conditions.
   Of the 21 Pine Forest defendants, 13 have been blacklisted in
the Philippines and cannot get shipping jobs, Dodson said.
   The other eight defendants did not appear in court and continued
to work on the ship while their Filipino union represented them, he
said.
   Dodson, who specializes in maritime law and has worked with the
Seamen's Church Institute, said he will represent sailors from the
Fir Grove cargo ship against Inui next July in a case identical to
the Pine Forest's.
   As long as shipping competition remains intense, companies will
look for methods such as double bookkeeping to hold down costs, he
said.
   ``The vessels cost the same. Finances, fuel and food are the
same. The only place you can possibly save money is in wages to the
crew, so if you want to gain some advantage you engage in some
nefarious activity such as double bookkeeping,'' Dodson said.

   Record-breaking cold gripped the Pacific Northwest on Saturday,
and temperatures moderated along the East Coast with some cities
registering record highs.
   Nine cities in Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington,
Oregon, and Nebraska had record low temperatures for the date.
   It was 17 below zero in Rapid City, S.D. - 12 degrees colder
than the record of 5 below set in 1978.
   Wind-chill temperatures dropped lower than 60 below zero in at
least four cities, including a wind-chill reading of 70 below zero
at Pierre, S.D.
   In contrast, 28 East Coast cities broke or tied records for high
temperatures. Among them, Cape Hatteras, N.C., was 75 degrees
Saturday, breaking a 1984 record for the date of 71.
   Snow and freezing rain warnings were posted over parts of
Oklahoma. Winter weather advisories were posted for portions of
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Kansas.
   Wind chill advisories were issued for Nebraska, North and South
Dakota, Minnesota and parts of Iowa and Missouri.
   A frost advisory was posted over the agricultural portions of
California's San Diego County.
   By 1 p.m. EST, rain extended over parts of New England, New
York, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Texas.
   Freezing rain reached over southwest Maine, east central Iowa
and parts of Kansas, Missouri and northwest Texas.
   Snow fell over parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa,

<HEAD>Salvadoran Guerrillas Announce Unilateral Truce on Dec. 31</HEAD>

   Salvadoran guerrillas have
announced an end to their six-week military offensive and declared
themselves ready for new peace talks to end their 11-year-old war
against the government.
   In a broadcast late Friday by the clandestine rebel radio, the
general command of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
said its cease-fire would take effect Monday morning.
   The rebels said they were prepared to resume peace talks aimed
at ending the civil war that has claimed more than 73,000 lives and
made a shambles of the economy in El Salvador, this Central
American country of 5 million people.
   The guerrillas promised to bring new proposals to their next
meeting with the government and ``if it abandons its intransigent
positions, we could reach an agreement rapidly.''
   There was no immediate comment from the government.
   The guerrillas claimed their military campaign, begun Nov. 20,
had caused 1,190 army casualties, including dead and wounded.
   Official statistics put the toll at more than 600 dead and 1,000
wounded, including soldiers, guerrillas and civilians.
   Early this month, the rebels for the first time shot down two
government planes with surface-to-air missiles. The attacks alarmed
the Salvadoran government, which relies heavily on the air force to
keep the rebels from launching full-scale assaults.
   The State Department, also worried, announced Dec. 7 it was
speeding delivery of $48.1 million in military aid to the
government. Those funds included $10.6 million from 1990 and $37.5
million from the 1991 account.
   Congress in October halved the $85 million in military aid
previously allotted for fiscal 1991, saying the Salvadoran
government was too slow in prosecuting human rights abusers in the
military.
   The promise of a truce, if carried out, would belie a U.S. State
Department claim last week that the rebels planned major military
attacks early in the year.
   ``Negotiation is the rational way to solve the conflict,'' the
guerrilla announcement said. ``Nevertheless, ARENA and the armed
forces oppose a peaceful solution with the argument that the
purification of the army is an obstacle.''
   ARENA is the Spanish acronym for the Nationalist Republican
Alliance, the elected right-wing governing party.
   U.N.-brokered negotiations have stalled over the guerrillas'
demand for major reductions in the size of the armed forces and
removal of officers implicated in human rights abuses. The army has
resisted such moves.

   PLO leaders said Saturday that Israeli and
Palestinian officials have met and discussed giving autonomy to the
occupied Gaza Strip in exchange for Palestinian concessions in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization said
a meeting took place last week in Paris. He said the PLO rejects
the proposal, though some individual Palestinian leaders may
consider it.
   ``The plan aims at providing the PLO with imaginary promises and
illusions in order to cause splits in the unified Palestinian
position over its support for Iraq,'' he said, speaking on
condition he not be identified.
   Reports on the meeting were confirmed by officials from the
PLO's mainstream Fatah faction, the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   A Saudi businessman, Israeli Labor Party leader Shimon Peres and
other Israelis ``met with a Palestinian personality and
representatives of some Arab states and discussed the possibility
of granting Gaza Strip to the Palestinians to exercise
self-autonomy there,'' according to Abdul-Rahim Mallouh, politburo
member of the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   Mallouh, whose faction is the second largest within the PLO,
said a final agreement was being proposed only after the ``PLO
offers some concessions,'' including withholding support from Iraq
and dropping the linkage between the Palestinian problem and Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   ``The Paris meeting was one of the American-Israeli plots to
implant a split within PLO ranks,'' he said. ``Once this happens,
they hope to strip Iraq of its main ally and of its claims to
secure a link between all regional problems.''
   Mallouh said that according to the plan, Israeli Housing
Minister Ariel Sharon would coordinate with Israeli left-wing
leader Shimon Peres on forming a new coalition government ``that
would take steps to implement this scheme.''
   There was no Israeli comment on the reported talks.
   The Gaza Strip, home to more than 800,000 Palestinians, was
captured from Egypt during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Arabs have rejected a previous Israeli plan to grant self-rule
to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
They have called for an Israeli withdrawal from those lands and the
formation of a Palestinian state after talks under the aegis of the
United Nations.
   Israeli leaders have rejected a binding international peace
conference on the Middle East. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has
recently suggested he would keep the territories under Israeli
rule.

   Vice President Dan Quayle left Saturday night
for a quick trip to Saudi Arabia to spend New Year's Day with
American troops and visit Saudi leaders and the exiled emir of
Kuwait.
   The vice president and his party took off at 7:45 p.m. EST from
Andrews Air Force Base outside the nation's capital.
   The trip comes just two weeks before the United Nations-imposed
deadline of Jan. 15 for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw
his army from Kuwait.
   Quayle's itinerary included a dinner Sunday night with Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah and a meeting with King Fahd to discuss the
state of the U.S.-led military buildup in the gulf region.
   After spending the night in Riyadh, Quayle and his entourage
will spend Monday and Tuesday visiting troops and sailors deployed
in Saudi Arabia.
   New Year's Day also will include a side trip to Taif, where
exiled Kuwaiti Emir Jaber al-Sabah will receive the vice president.
   Quayle will return to Washington in the pre-dawn hours on
Wednesday.
   Administration officials said the visit primarily is intended as
a morale builder for the troops as tensions mount over whether and
when armed conflict will break out with Iraq.
   Among the more than 400,000 troops President Bush has ordered to
the Gulf are many who serve, as Quayle did, in the National Guard.
   Quayle's military background has caused him some controversy.
When Bush selected him as his vice presidential running mate in
1988, allegations arose that Quayle's family had pulled strings to
get him into the Indiana National Guard in 1969 so he would not
have to be drafted and sent to Vietnam.
   Quayle has said he is proud of his Guard service, and took that
route so he could finish law school while fulfilling his military
obligation.
   Quayle's staff said there were no plans for him to carry a new
diplomatic initiative on the gulf standoff, and that his meetings
with Fahd and the emir were of consultative nature.
   His visit comes as Baghdad and Washington remain stalemated over
a date for Saddam to meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III for talks on the crisis.

   President Bush's resoluteness in foreign affairs
in contrast to his ``wavering and confusion'' over domestic
policies made him Time magazine's two-faced man of the year in
1990.
   Time said Saturday that the ``two sides of President Bush'' will
be presented in the cover story of its Jan. 7 issue, which hits
newsstands Monday.
   One is a leader whose foreign policy during the year ``was a
study in resoluteness and mastery,'' the magazine said Saturday.
The other is a leader whose domestic track record was ``just as
strongly marked by wavering and confusion.''
   ``We did something a little unusual this year, a little
unorthodox,'' Time Managing Editor Henry Muller said at a news
conference.
   The magazine said Bush ``raised a vision of a new world order''
by taking the lead in a United Nations embargo against Iraq and a
military buildup in the Persian Gulf after Iraq's invasion and
annexation of Kuwait in early August.
   But domestically, Bush left ``things alone until he could no
longer avoid taking action,'' Time said.
   ``Global diplomacy is what he has trained for and what absorbs
him; domestic affairs are just not as much fun,'' Time said.
   Bush narrowly defeated Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for the
Man of the Year title, Muller said.
   ``Why didn't we pick Saddam? The answer in the end really is
that invading a little country is not enough to make you man of the
year,'' Muller said.
   Others cited as some of the year's most important newsmakers
were South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian
republic.
   Every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt has been selected by
the magazine as its man of the year.

   Although a tenth of the U.S. Navy's
officers are women, Lt. Cmdr. Darlene M. Iskra last week became the
first to captain her own ship. She'll be even happier, she says,
when women are allowed into battle.
   ``Women are in every aspect of naval duties today,'' Iskra said
Saturday. ``We're limited in the type of ship that we may board,
but that might change, and I hope it does.''
   Women are not permitted to serve aboard combat ships.
   Iskra, 38, was installed Thursday night as commander of the USS
Opportune, a salvage ship with a 98-member, all-male crew.
   She replaced Cmdr. Edgar J. Jones, who flew to the United States
from the U.S. Sixth Fleet base in Naples for emergency medical
treatment. Iskra had been scheduled to replace Jones on Jan. 24.
   ``My being a woman is just not an issue. I'm different from
Cmdr. Jones, but if I was a male I would be different from him
too,'' she said.
   ``It's geat,'' she said of her assignment. ``It's the best
thing I've ever done.''
   Iskra, of South San Francisco, Calif., is a special operations
officer and the Navy's most senior female diving officer, though
she won't be doing much diving as the Opportune's commander.
   Before her assignment to the USS Opportune, Iskra was
second-in-command of the USS Preserver, based in Little Creek, Va.
   After earning a bachelor's degree at San Francisco State
University, she entered the Navy's officer candidate school in
Newport, R.I. in March 1979.
   ``I've always liked the ocean,'' she said. ``My father tried to
join the Navy when he was 16, but he was under age. It was during
World War II and they kicked him out. He joined the Merchant Marine
instead.''
   Crew members said there had been little negative reaction to
Iskra's appointment.
   ``You must respect the uniform and the rank, regardless of who's
behind them,'' said Bill Watterson, a senior chief petty officer
from Norfolk, Va.
   ``It's going to cause some of us to be more careful of our
so-called sailor talk,'' he added with a grin.
   The Opportune, currently on a five-month tour, recovers
equipment or the wreckage of ships from the sea and sometimes tows
disabled vessels.
   The ship will not enter combat zones but could be stationed
somewhere outside the Persian Gulf to help in the event of a war,
said Lt. Scott Campbell, a Navy public information officer in
Naples. Iskra's appointment is to last 30 months.
   Iskra's husband and fellow Navy diver, Lt. Cmdr. Marc J. Thomas,
is the commanding officer of a special boat unit in Norfolk, Va.

   The National Assembly confirmed the
army's choice for president Saturday without a vote, and some
members stormed out of the chamber in protest.
   The new president was sworn in five days after the military
threw out President Ramsewak Shankar in a bloodless coup and
pledged to install a ``non-political'' interim cabinet and organize
a popular vote.
   Shankar had been locked in a bitter dispute with former army
commander Cmdr. Desi Bouterse, who ruled Suriname as dictator from
1980-1988.
   The main purpose of the new government will be to organize
elections within 100 days, according to the military.
   The new president, Johan Kraag, in his late 70s, belongs to the
National Party of Suriname. Ousted Vice President Henck Arron is a
member of the same party.
   Jules Wijdenbosch was also sworn in as the new vice president.
He is a former prime minister who organized Suriname's last popular
elections in 1987, which Shankar won. Wijdenbosch is chairman of
the National Democratic Party, which was organized by Bouterse.
   One National Assembly member, Arti Jesurun, vice president of
the National Party of Suriname, said on Surinamese radio there had
been an agreement for a secret ballot, but the rules were reversed
Saturday.
   ``As far as I am concerned, the National Assembly approved the
new president and vice president with bowed heads,'' Jesurun said.
   National Assembly Chairman Jaggernath Lathmon said that under
Surinamese tradition, no vote was necessary because there was only
one candidate for each office. He declared the nominees to be
unanimously approved without a vote.
   Several of the 51 members at the session stormed out of the
chamber, leaving 34 members on the assembly floor. Had a vote taken
place, at least two-thirds - 34 votes - were needed for approval.
   Shankar and his Cabinet formally submitted their resignations to
the National Assembly on Thursday. The military claims that
Suriname's constitution permits military intervention as long as
the National Assembly is left intact.
   This ethnically diverse nation of 400,000 people on the
northeast coast of South America has suffered progressive economic
decline since 1980, the year that Bouterse rose to power in a coup.
   Shankar's overthrow coincided with growing popular discontent
with his government's inability to revive the economy of this
former Dutch colony, beset by high inflation and unemployment. The
government has a monthly trade deficit of $10 million.
   Bouterse stepped down as army chief just hours before the latest
coup in the culmination of a long-running dispute with Shankar. He
is widely believed to have planned the coup.
   In Washington, the Organization of American States on Friday
denounced the military takeover. The United States joined in the
protest.
   Domestic opposition to the takeover has been muted, although the
daily De Ware Tyd on Friday accused the army of ``imposing its will
on the government.''
   Bouterse still remains the most powerful army figure in the
country as chairman the Military Authority, which supervised the
armed forces. He resigned as army chief, but that resignation is
expected to be reviewed by the new government, the army has stated.

<HEAD>New Attitude Tops Annual List of Resolutions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WISNIEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attitude adjustment is more important in
preventing disease than changes in diet and exercise habits, the
American Institute for Preventive Medicine says in its New Year's
resolutions list.
   The No. 1 entry on the institute's sixth annual ``Top Ten
Healthiest Resolutions'' list is to avoid ``psychosclerosis'' - a
hardening of the attitudes, Dr. Don Powell, president of the
institute, said Friday.
   ``It's the way we view the events in life,'' he said. ``We used
to think physical fitness was from the neck down, but now we see it
as more of an integration of mind and body.''
   Powell, author of ``365 Health Hints,'' said working out at the
gym isn't enough for people who want to live longer, healthier
lives.
   ``You have to look at their attitude, the way they deal with
stress, whether they have a social support network, and the way
they view life,'' he said.
   Adopting the resolutions on the list, which is based on recent
medical research, could add up to 20 years to a person's life,
Powell said.
   The list includes traditional good-health commandments like
watch weight, reduce cholesterol, get physical, control blood
pressure, limit alcohol and use seat belts. It also includes
resolutions to control hostility and develop a social support
network.
   Stop smoking appears on the 1991 list as it has each year since
1985, but this year's list includes a resolution to avoid smokers
to escape the potentially harmful effects of passive smoke outlined
in a recent U.S. Surgeon General's report.
   Thomas Lauria, spokesman for the Washington-based Tobacco
Institute, said that that resolution suggests segregating 30
percent of the population and would foster unnecessary ill will.
   ``We're seeing a 90's version of the new segregationist,''
Lauria said. ``Imagine if you put any other group in that category,
like don't associate with Catholics. Can you imagine the outbreak
that would cause?''
   Resolutions to get at least seven hours of sleep each night was
bumped off the list for 1991 to make room for the attitude
adjustment priority.
   Other past resolutions include seeking the medicinal values of
laughter, avoiding loneliness and practicing safe sex.
   ``That's not to say safe sex isn't a critical issue in our time,
too, but the mental health issues take precedent,'' Powell said.

   Frigid air threatened what was left of California's ravaged
citrus crop Saturday, and parts of the East were in a fog as
temperatures rose and the snow that fell just a day earlier melted,
making roads slushy and slippery.
   Temperatures rose on both coasts, but the Dakotas, Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming and Utah stayed in a deep freeze.
   ``In the coldest areas, farmers will suffer more crop damage,''
Betty Reo of the National Weather Service in California said.
   Daytime temperatures on Sunday could reach 60 in Los Angeles and
the 50s in San Francisco, but growers could battle temperatures in
the 20s in inland areas throughout the state overnight, the weather
service said.
   That prompted concern over crops that escaped the first cold
blitz and the future of the groves themselves.
   ``What a lot of growers are concerned about this weekend is how
much tree damage they'll have,'' said Tom McNair of the state
Department of Food and Agriculture.
   The San Joaquin Valley, the state's major orange growing area,
saw its navel orange crop virtually destroyed last weekend as
temperatures sank into the low 20s and the teens. The loss has been
estimated at up to $288 million.
   One day after Pennsylvania residents struggled with snow up to
16 inches deep, they encountered another hurdle to driving - fog.
   ``The whole state's pretty much blanketed in fog,'' Doug Young,
a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Saturday
morning.
   The fog is produced by warm air moving over the cold snow,
causing the snow to evaporate, he said. Visibility in many places
this morning ranged from a half-mile to zero.
   ``It could make driving hazardous, especially since there's a
lot of slush on the road already,'' Young said. ``Everything seems
to be the same color.''
   In south-central Pennsylvania, freezing rain caused numerous
accidents, police said.
   A 10-year-old Chambersburg boy was killed and his brother was
critically injured in a traffic accident caused by ice on the road
Friday night before the fog set in.
   Icy roads in Oklahoma were blamed for the deaths Saturday of
four people, including a Houston man, in three car crashes. There
have been more than 90 weather-related deaths since the wave of
cold began Dec. 18.
   By afternoon, the fog thinned, and temperatures reached the 40s
and 50s, melting most of the snowpack. More rain also was forecast,
raising the possibility of flooding.
   Frigid temperatures enveloped Montana on Saturday, with Butte
reporting the nation's lowest temperature - 36 degrees below zero.
   Arctic air swept in by a strong north wind plunged Nebraska into
a deep freeze with wind chills down to 58 below zero at Columbus.
   ``It's colder than the devil,'' said Bill Joseph, owner of the
Pepper Mill Cafe in Valentine, the coldest spot in the state at 20
degrees below zero.
   ``A lot of people's cars won't start today,'' he said. ``Some
people had theirs plugged in and it still wouldn't start.''
   The second winter storm that hit Washington state in two weeks
battered beaches as well as inland areas and emergency officials
said as many as 10 waterfront homes on Puget Sound have been
destroyed or damaged by storm waves. About three dozen more were
threatened by water after bulkheads were washed out.
   The water damage was part of the windstorm that whipped into
Washington early Friday, with frigid temperatures and some snow.
One woman on Vashon Island was killed by a falling tree.
   About 150,000 utility customers in western Washington were
without electricity at one time.
   Puget Sound Power and Light spokeswoman Heidi Dunlap said 52,000
customers were still without power Saturday morning. She said crews
hoped to have service restored by Sunday night.
   No power meant no heat, so three shelters were set up. About 300
people spent the night in them.
   Authorities also worked in below-zero temperatures Saturday to
restore power to Ortonville in western Minnesota, a town of about
2,600 residents.
   In Arkansas, anticipated showers provoked the National Weather
Service to issue a flash flood watch for the southeastern
two-thirds of the state.
   The weather service issued a flood warning Saturday for
northwest, north-central and west-central Indiana after more than
1{ inches of rain fell in areas.
   New Year's Day will bring some good news to Southern California,
said forecasters, who foresee picture-perfect weather for the Rose
Parade and Rose Bowl game with highs in the upper 60s.
   And in Philadelphia, most of the snow was expected to melt by
Sunday, so it should not interfere with the annual Mummer's Parade
on New Year's Day.

   Anatoly Karpov kept his hopes alive for a
50-50 cut of the $3 million World Chess Championship prize money
Saturday by defeating Garry Kasparov, who has already won the
title, in the 23rd game of their match.
   Karpov, playing white, forced his fellow Soviet grandmaster to
withdraw in the 29th move after 3 hours, 50 minutes of play. That
narrowed Kasparov's lead in their series to 12-11.
   The pair play their 24th and final game Monday.
   Kasparov, who needed only 12 points to keep his title,
successfully defended it for the third time Wednesday by drawing
with Karpov. The 0.5 points awarded for the draw brought Kasparov's
point total to 12 against 10 for Karpov.
   But Karpov's victory Saturday night brought the score to 12-11,
and the final game is vital for both men in terms of dividing up
the prize money.
   If Karpov wins the last match, he assures himself of an equal
$1.5-million share with his rival. If he loses or draws, he will
have to settle for a $1.3 million share, while Kasparov pockets
$1.7 million.

<HEAD>Cuomo Plans Modest Inauguration Ceremony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who had scrapped plans for
a fancy inauguration because of his state's tight budget, says he
now plans a modest swearing-in ceremony.
   ``It won't be a big public ceremony,'' said the Democrat
governor, who begins his third four-year term on New Year's Day.
   Last month, Cuomo canceled plans for a traditional public
inauguration, a move he estimated would save the state about
$70,000, and planned a private inauguration instead.
   Cuomo changed his mind last week, saying an inaugural ceremony
is ``a nice tradition'' although not legally necessary since he was
continuing in office.
   Cuomo and Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine will be sworn in Monday
afternoon at the New York Court of Appeals building by Chief Judge
Sol Wachtler, and the ceremony will cost nothing, the governor
said.
   Earlier this month, Cuomo and the state Legislature approved a
package of spending cuts to help eliminate a projected $1 billion
deficit. The governor also is laying off 2,000 state workers by the
end of the fiscal year on March 31.
   When he announced he was canceling the traditional inauguration,
Cuomo said he wanted to ``avoid the expense it would necessarily
entail.''
   Past inaugural ceremonies included rousing gospel choirs and
Indian chiefs in traditional dress.

<HEAD>Iraqi Dissidents Vow To Topple Saddam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi opposition factions say they want
to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and form a transitional
government to hold free elections and establish a democracy,
newspapers reported Saturday.
   The conservative al-Anwar and pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq dailies
published a statement by 15 oppositon groups saying the
transitional government should be set up in Baghdad once Saddam has
been toppled.
   It also said the state of emergency should be abolished, a
general amnesty should be declared for all Saddam's opponents, and
human rights should be guaranteed.
   The dissident groups have been meeting in Damascus, capital of
Syria.
   The Syrians are Saddam's archrivals in the Arab world. They have
sent about 19,000 troops to join the U.S.-dominated multinational
force opposing Iraq.
   The crisis has accelerated moves by the disparate and often
fractious Iraqi opposition groups to unite and exploit Saddam's
international isolation.
   They have been seriously weakened by Saddam's ruthless
elimination of opponents, his pervasive security apparatus, and
their own divisions. All the groups are banned in Iraq.
   In recent months, they have made more determined moves to
present a viable alternative to Saddam's one-man rule through the
Baath Socialist Party.
   But analysts do not believe the dissident factions pose a
significant threat to Saddam, even in the dire straits he now finds
himself. Most analysts believe that the Iraqi army is the only
organization capable of toppling him.
   The opposition groups in Damascus included the Iranian-backed
Shiite Moslem ad-Dawa Islami movement, or Islamic Call, which has
waged a bloody terrorist campaign against Baghdad for more than a
decade. Other groups taking part were a splinter Baath faction, the
Independent Arab Nationalists, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led
by veteran guerrilla Jalal Talabani, and other Kurdish factions.
   The Kurdish groups, which have a history of feuding among
themselves, have been fighting the Baghdad government off and on
for decades seeking an independent Kurdish homeland. There are
about 3.5 million Kurds in Iraq's 17 million population.

   Iraq on Saturday denied reports that it is engaged in secret
contacts with Washington to avert war and might withdraw from
Kuwait before the United Nation's Jan. 15 deadline.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, meanwhile, held talks on a
new effort by the world's non-aligned nations to defuse the buildup
in the Persian Gulf.
   Vice President Dan Quayle left Washington late Saturday on a
quick trip to Saudi Arabia to spend New Year's Day with American
troops and to visit Saudi leaders and the exiled emir of Kuwait.
   Iraq's information minister, Latif Nussayif Jassim, denied a
report by Radio Monte Carlo that secret U.S.-Iraqi contacts were
under way, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   The radio report quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in Egypt
as saying Iraq was considering some ideas proposed by Washington.
The radio said these include an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in
exchange for assurances that it will not be attacked by the
U.S.-led multinational force, which is expected to total more than
half a million troops by the end of January.
   ``These are ridiculous ideas and figments of the imagination,''
Jassim was quoted as saying.
   Independent Radio Monte Carlo, which has an Arabic-language
service widely listened to in the Middle East, is generally
reliable in its reporting on the Persian Gulf situation.
   A statement later Saturday by Iraq's ruling Revolutionary
Command Council called the report a ``sick interpretation (that)
exists only in the minds of the planners of evil and their suspect
circles.''
   U.S. officials have also denied that secret talks are being
held.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has sent an estimated 500,000
troops to southern Iraq and Kuwait since he seized the emirate on
Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   The statement by his ruling council reaffirmed Iraq's
determination to hold on to the conquered emiate despite the U.N.
deadline to pullout by Jan. 15 or face possible attack.
   A political activist in Jordan said Saturday that Saddam has
messaged King Fahd of Saudi Arabia warning that his country will be
Iraq's second target after Israel if Saudi leaders continue to push
for war.
   Azmi Khawaja, leader of the Marxist Popular Jordanian Democratic
Unity Party, said Saddam spoke to him of the letter during a
90-minute meeting in Baghdad this week.
   Last week, Saddam threatened to attack Israel in the event of
war.
   Aziz took a hard line in his discussions with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Budimir Loncar, who was in Baghdad on behalf of the
102-nation non-aligned movement, which Yugoslavia leads.
   Iraq's state news agency reported that Aziz repeated Iraqi
demands to link a pullout of Kuwait with a resolution of the
Arab-Israeli dispute. The United States has repeatedly rejected
attempts to link the two issues, demanding Saddam's unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Details of Loncar's initiative were not given. Previous attempts
at mediation have failed but Loncar's new initiative had at least
one difference: both Iraq and Kuwait belong to the non-aligned
movement, which rejects any formal military alliances with East or
West.
   Loncar was to meet Sunday with Saddam. Last month, he visited
Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Jordan for talks on the
crisis.
   Aziz told reporters there had been no breakthrough in the
stalemate over fixing a date for direct U.S.-Iraqi talks. Iraq had
invited Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit on Jan. 12,
but the Bush administration says that is too close to the Jan. 15
deadline. Washington has said any Baker-Saddam meeting must take
place before Thursday.
   In other developments:
   -Iraqi media reported that up to 300,000 paramilitary troops in
the Kurdish region have been reactivated to shore up the country's
northern border with Turkey, part of the anti-Iraq coalition.
   The Iraqi buildup at the Turkish border is believed to include
at least eight divisions, including two armored divisions, or
possibly more than 100,000 men, Asian diplomats in Baghdad said
Saturday.
   Turkey has requested NATO send 42 jetfighters as a deterrent
against Iraq, and Germany is considering taking part in the force.
   -In Bonn, Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
proposed that his European Community colleagues convene a special
meeting next week to discuss the gulf crisis, German radio reported
Saturday. Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio said Genscher has suggested
the meeting occur on Jan. 4.
   Further details were not immediately available.
   -An Air Force weather forecaster said the U.S. military isn't
getting important data collected by Saudi Arabia, even as winter
sandstorms and choppy seas pose new obstacles for U.S.-led forces.
   The forecaster, Capt. Judy Dickey, said that although the
kingdom does supply some information, it does not share data on
wind speed and direction, fearing that teletype reports would aid
Iraq in launching a chemical or biological attack.
   -American medical experts say a U.S. plan to inoculate troops in
the gulf against germ warfare agents could not possibly protect
servicemen against all of the hundreds of microbes that could be
used in a biological attack.
   Dr. Bradley Sack, a Johns Hopkins University expert on
infectious diseases, said the troops would have to be vaccinated
weeks or even months in advance for sufficient protection against
disease.
   In Toulon, French chief of staff Gen. Maurice Schmitt said
Saturday that his country's soldiers in the gulf or en route have
been vaccinated for contagious diseases like typhus and cholera.
   British officials say they are also inoculating their forces.
   -A 66-year-old Swedish peace activist was hospitalized in Oman
for a heart condition after U.S. forces on Wednesday intercepted
the Iraqi ship she was on in the Arabian Sea.
   Omani Health Ministry officials said Margaret Andersson was on a
cardiac monitor in a hospital Saturday after the U.S. Navy
airlifted her from the freighter. The freighter was carrying sugar
and other goods in violation of a U.N. embargo on Iraq.
   -In Tunis, Tunisia, 12 of the 15 Iraqi civil servants employed
by the Arab League quit Saturday in protest of next week's transfer
of the 21-nation organization's headquarters to Cairo. Egypt is one
of the leading Arab countries opposed to Baghdad in the gulf
crisis. On Saturday, it sent 1,000 more soldiers to Saudi Arabia to
reinforce its 20,000-member force.

<TEXT>
   A 20-year transit veteran who operated a Boston trolley that
crashed into another rail car had an alcohol level above the
Massachusetts drunken driving limit, transit officials said
Saturday.
   Investigators worked into the weekend to learn the circumstances
of the Boston accident, which injured 33 people, and a New York
subway fire, which injured 150 and claimed a second life Saturday.
Both occurred underground Friday morning.
   New York Mayor David Dinkins said he expected city workers to
have a report on his desk by Monday afternoon. He ordered the
review amid charges that mistakes and confusion hampered rescue
operations.
   Questions also arose about whether huge ventilation fans in the
Brooklyn subway tunnel that were out of order could have drawn away
smoke from the electrical fire.
   In Boston, federal safety officials began inspecting the
trolleys involved. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
officials said the brakes and signals functioned properly, but the
operator said he had trouble braking.
   ``There is no indication that we know of at this time that
alcohol was used on the job,'' said Peter Dimond, an MBTA
spokesman. He said officials believe the operator drank before
starting his shift.
   Dimond said he could not release the exact alcohol test results
for the 64-year-old MBTA worker, but said the operator exceeded the
state's blood alcohol drunken driving limit, which is .10 percent.
The driver, whose name was not released, has been suspended without
pay.
   The driver was on the return leg of his first trip at 6:34 a.m.
when the car he was steering crashed into the rear of another Green
Line trolley at Arlington Station in the city's downtown district.
   Transit officials were trying to determine whether the operator
involved in the crash was the one a passenger had called to
complain about just a half hour earlier.
   ``We got a message that there was abusive language, that the
driver was not behaving properly, but there was no indication that
there was a safety risk,'' Dimond said.
   The Boston Herald reported that Tony Niederberger of Watertown
telephoned MBTA police and told a fare collector that a driver was
cursing and had sped through a curve, knocking passengers from
their seats.
   The MBTA promised a prompt public hearing.
   ``We want to be fair to the operator. We want to be fair to the
traveling public as well,'' Dimond said.
   The New York review will include recommendations on preventing
further accidents and ensuring rescue efforts ``are performed in a
timely and coordinated fashion,'' Dinkins said.
   Fire and transit authorities blamed melting slush for
short-circuiting a transformer, which exploded and caused a smoky
fire that stopped a Manhattan-bound train.
   Passenger Peter Hagen, 35, of Smithtown, N.Y., apparently
suffered a heart attack and was pronounced dead Friday on arrival
at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn.
   Another rider, Dorene Blumenthal, 37, of Massapequa Park, N.Y.,
died early Saturday at the hospital, said nursing supervisor Fran
Peszko.

   Two former dictators who led the
1970s ``dirty war'' against a leftist insurgency and a rebel leader
whose movement inspired the repression were freed Saturday by
government pardons.
   The onetime dictators, former army Gens. Jorge Videla and
Roberto Viola, and Montonero guerrilla founder Mario Eduardo
Firmenich, walked free for the first time since 1984.
   Videla and Viola were among 11 former officials, mostly generals
convicted of torture and other rights abuses, who were pardoned
under an order announced Thursday by President Carlos Menem.
   Menem, who last year freed 39 other generals and 64 terrorists,
said Saturday's releases would ``definitely close a sad and black
stage of Argentine history.''
   The pardons, however, will reopen wounds for many Argentines.
Recent polls have shown up to 80 percent of the population opposed
freeing the men who symbolized a painful period in which thousands
were spirited away by men in civilian clothing and never seen
again.
   The army said its unconventional war in the late 1970s and early
1980s was the only kind possible to fight leftist insurgents. Human
rights groups say up to 30,000 people died in a campaign of
genocide.
   ``This is a very sad day for Argentina,'' said former President
Raul Alfonsin, who pushed forward the bitter trials of the military
regime after being elected in 1983. Menem succeeded him last year.
   Politicians, clergy and human rights activists planned to
demonstrate Sunday across this South American nation of 31 million
people.
   The others freed by Menem's announcement included dismissed
Admiral Emilio Massera and former army chief of staff Carlos Suarez
Mason, who was extradited from the United States in 1988 for a
trial that never was held.
   Argentina's war began in the early 1970s, when leftists trying
to topple the government unleashed a wave of assassinations,
bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings for ransom.
   Firmenich boldly announced the existence of the Montoneros in
June 1970 by kidnapping and executing former military president
Pedro Aramburu.
   Growing unrest led Videla and Viola to stage the March 1976 coup
that overthrew President Isabel Peron. Videla became president
until 1981, when Viola took over for a year.
   The military stepped down in December 1983 after its disastrous
defeat in the Falklands War with Britain.
   Officials have documented the disappearance of at least 8,960
people in the years after the 1976 coup. All are presumed to have
been kidnapped and executed by the military.
   According to testimony in the trials, the military burned the
bodies of some its victims, buried others in unmarked graves and
tossed some from helicopters into the sea. Thousands of Argentine
families spent years trying to find out what happened to loved
ones. Some still don't know.
   Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize,
said the pardons ``signify the consecration of impunity for the
authors of grave crimes against humanity.''
   Menem, a former governor jailed for nearly five years by Videla,
said he was ready to surrender the past and so should his
countrymen in the interest of national reconciliation and political
stability.
   The pending trials of ``dirty war'' officers sparked three army
insurrections in recent years, and the imprisonment of Videla and
the others was the justification for a fourth uprising, on Dec. 3.
   The government news agency Telam said Videla, Viola, Massera and
retired Gen. Pablo Riccheri were released from Magdalena military
prison, 62 miles south of Buenos Aires, and taken away in a
helicopter.
   Firmenich was met outside Devoto prison in Buenos Aires by his
lawyer and family, and whisked away by car.
   Suarez Mason and dismissed general Ramon Camps were released
from a military hospital in the capital, Telam reported.
   The others who received pardons, including former economy
minister Jose Martinez de Hoz, already had been freed. Two of the
former officials, Norma Kennedy and Duilio Brunello, served prison
terms for fraud charges unrelated to the ``dirty war.''
   The pardon cleared a total of 12 men and women of pending
charges, officials said, but since the decree has not been
published it wasn't known if it permits those pardoned to hold
public office again.

   Twenty-four F-16 pilots left for Saudi
Arabia Saturday, flying the first Air National Guard fighter jets
deployed in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Also Saturday, five Charleston-based warships, part of a 17-ship
fleet headed for the Middle East, left port after heavy fog lifted.
They had been scheduled to leave Friday.
   Pilots from the 169th Tactical Fighter Group took off from
McEntire Air National Guard Base near Eastover. The 15-hour flight
to Saudi Arabia - the unit's longest - will require at least 10
in-flight refuelings.
   More than 700 other members of the unit, mostly support crew,
will follow during the next three weeks.
   The F-16s will fly 7,000 miles without a rest stop, said one
pilot, Capt. Thorne Ambrose.
   ``No one in the squadron has ever flown that far at one shot,
and each one of us is dealing with staying awake in our own way,''
he said. ``We will talk to each other a lot and some of us are
taking CD players and Walkmans to pass the time. And, of course, we
will be busy refueling.''
   Two airborne fuel tankers accompanied the unit.
   The 169th is the first Air National Guard fighter unit in the
nation and the largest South Carolina National Guard unit deployed
for Operation Desert Shield.
   The F-16s are capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground combat and
are commonly armed with AIM-9 missiles and a 20-mm machine gun.
   The guided-missile cruiser Richmond K. Turner, the
guided-missile destroyer William V. Pratt, the guided-missile
frigates Halyburton and Hawes and the ammunition ship Santa Barbara
left the Charleston Naval Station Saturday.
   The ships, carrying about 1,500 sailors, are part of a 17-ship
East Coast deployment.
   The United States began a massive military buildup in the region
after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. The United Nations has set a Jan.
15 deadline for Iraqi troops to withdraw.

<HEAD>Cuba Announces New Pact With Soviets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cash-strapped Cuba signed a new economic aid
pact with the Soviet Union on Saturday. Cuba's official news agency
said Soviet exports would be adjusted, but it gave no figures.
   Soviet officials have warned that the crisis in their own
country would mean significant cuts in aid to Cuba, whose hard-line
Communist government is increasingly at odds with the changing
Soviet Union.
   Western experts say Cuba has received about $5 billion yearly in
economic help and $1.5 billion in military aid for many of the past
30 years.
   The Prensa Latina agency, in a dispatch from Moscow, did not
reveal detailed information about the aid agreement, which it said
was signed after 10 days of talks.
   The agreement was reached by the Cuban foreign commerce
minister, Ricardo Cabrisas, and the Soviet economic relations
minister, Konstantin Katushev, the agency reported.
   ``Cuban sources considered the volumes of Soviet exports
adjusted to the requirements of the country in the special period''
facing Cuba, said the agency, monitored in Mexico City.
   The ``special period'' refers to austerity measures adopted to
confront Cuba's loss of its friends in Eastern Europe, the
declining Soviet economy and increases in the price of oil, which
Cuba must import.
   More and more goods are rationed in Cuba, Communist officials
are being shipped off to do farm work in the countryside, and the
leadership is promoting the use of bicycles to save gasoline.
   The agency said Cuba agreed to ship sugar, nickel, citrus,
tobacco, alcoholic drinks, medications and biotechnology products
to the Soviet Union.
   In return, Cuba will receive fuel, cereals, chemical and metal
products, machinery and other goods, as well as continued technical
and economic assistance.
   Foreign aid is to be considered by the Soviet parliament next
month, and Soviet officials have suggested Cuba's aid may be cut.
   The Soviet Union wants its allies to pay in convertible currency
at world prices starting Jan. 1. That would be a major blow to
Cuba, which has long enjoyed subsidized Soviet exports in return
for exports shipped at inflated prices.

   A light earthquake rattled an area in
west-central Washington State late Saturday, the U.S. Geological
Survey said.
   The agency said the tremor was centered about 30 miles east of
Seattle and occurred at 6:21 p.m. PST.
   USGS earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said they recorded
the tremor at a preliminary magnitude of 3.5 on the Richter scale.
That is enough to cause slight damage.
   It was reported in the Snoqualmie and North Bend areas.
   Every increase of one number on the Richter scale means the
ground motion is 10 times greater.

   Hundreds of American Indians held a
spiritual ceremony Saturday at this massacre site to commemorate
the 100th anniversary of one of the saddest days in their history.
   About 100 horseback riders and several hundred other people
watched as Indian spiritual leaders conducted the half-hour
ceremony in sub-zero temperatures at the grave site of 146 Sioux
Indians killed by U.S. Cavalry troops a century ago.
   ``To us, it was a massacre unjustified,'' said Mario Gonzalez,
attorney for the Wounded Knee Survivors Association. ``The Army had
no legal right to do what it did. We want Wounded Knee to be
remembered, so it will never happen again.''
   Russell Means, a leader of the militant American Indian
Movement, blocked the entrance to the cemetery when Gov. George
Mickelson showed up to pay his respects. The governor made no
effort to get past him, but entered the cemetery later, said an
aide, Gretchen Lord Anderson.
   ``It would be an insult (for Mickelson to enter) because we live
in the racist state of South Dakota and he is the governor,'' Means
said.
   ``He said I wasn't welcome,'' the governor said. ``He wants to
make a mockery of all that has occurred in reconciliation.''
   Mickelson later declared 1990 the Year of Reconciliation as part
of state efforts to improve relations between Indians and
non-Indians.
   The morning ceremony was conducted in temperatures of 21 below
and a wind chill of 60 to 70 below zero.
   Riders who circled the cemetery rode past a spiritual leader
holding up a can of burning sage. They waved their hands and eagle
feathers at the smoke to purify themselves as others beat drums and
sang traditional songs.
   The riders had retraced the 220-mile journey that Chief Big Foot
and his band took before they were killed by cavalry troops at
Wounded Knee. The riders endured snow and sub-zero wind chills
during part of their two-week ride.
   ``I think it (weather) was probably appropriate during this ride
because Indian people believe that when they make a pledge and
commitment that suffering is part of that pledge and commitment,''
said Colorado Congressman Dan Night Horse Campbell, an Indian.
   The crowd later went to a school seven miles away for other
ceremonies at which Mickelson and others spoke. The names of those
who died at Wounded Knee were read.
   ``The massacre at Wounded Knee is one of many dark moments in
American history,'' Mickelson said.
   Mickelson said he was ``pledging my own commitment to learn from
our past in order to build a future for all South Dakotans
regardless of race or culture.''
   The governor said he will keep trying to persuade federal
officials to create a national monument at Wounded Knee. The site
should be preserved according to the wishes of Wounded Knee
descendants, he said.
   Hundreds of Sioux men, women and children were killed b U.S.
cavalry soldiers at Wounded Knee in an event that some historians
said signified the end of the Indian wars.
   On Friday, nearly 300 horseback riders and others on foot
endured wind-chill temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero
Friday on their way to the ceremony.
   The riders assembled their horses in a circle at the massacre
site Friday and prayed for peace within the Sioux Nation and
throughout the world.
   Two former American Indian Movement leaders, Means and Dennis
Banks, joined the riders last week. Some riders said they were
bothered by the participation of activists associated with the
armed takeover of Wounded Knee in 1973, which led to two deaths.
   After Sioux leader Sitting Bull was killed in December 1890, Big
Foot led a band of about 400 Sioux from central South Dakota to
seek refuge at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern
South Dakota.
   Accounts differ as to who fired first and how many died when the
cavalry intercepted the Sioux. The federal government says about
150 Indians died; the Sioux say as many as 400 were killed.

<HEAD>Construction Company Convicted of Homicide Charges in Workers'
Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A construction company was found guilty of
homicide in the deaths of two workers killed in a methane gas
explosion at a sewer excavation site.
   Milwaukee County Circuit Court jurors deliberated about 4{ hours
Friday before finding S.A. Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., guilty of two
counts of homicide by reckless conduct in the deaths of Tony Bell,
25, of Sturgeon Bay, Wis., and Rick Sochacki, 34, of South Holland,
Ill.
   Also killed in the Nov. 10, 1988, explosion was project
superintendent Ron Kohne, 49, of Big Sandy, Tenn. The men died in a
tunnel that is part of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage
Commission's $2 billion improvement project.
   Miwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann announced
the state charges at the same time federal prosecutors revealed a
12-count indictment charging the company with criminal violations
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.
   The company was convicted of failing to provide and maintain a
sufficient ventilation system and proper electrical equipment, of
providing inadequate safety instruction to employees, and of
failing to de-energize electrical power in the area where high
levels of methane gas were detected.
   Testimony at a coroner's inquest last December indicated the
tunnel had been cleared of workers the day the blast occurred
because of high methane levels. The victims were returning to check
the tunnel when the gas exploded.
   Healy attorney David Cannon denied the company was careless.
Kohne wouldn't have entered the tunnel if he had thought there was
a hazard, he argued.
   Project manager Patrick Doig, a mining engineer, testified that
the tunnel's ventilation system was adequate. Cannon said
engineering consultants hadn't encouraged Healy to install extra
safety measures.
   Healy faces a fine of $10,000 on each count. After the verdict,
lawyers said they couldn't comment because civil suits are pending.
   A U.S. District Court trial is scheduled Jan. 22 the 12
misdemeanor counts, which carry a cumulative maximum penalty of $6
million.

   A power outage darkened National Airport
outside the nation's capital for four hours Saturday and airline
workers reverted to pre-computer era methods to get travelers on
their way.
   Security workers checked luggage by hand as X-ray machines went
dark and ticket agents found themselves working without benefit of
the computer reservation systems normally used.
   There were some delays at the airport, located just across the
Potomac River from Washington, and a few flights were canceled. But
a backup generator provided enough emergency power to keep air
operations going.
   The airport's acting manager, Ronald Strange, said all airline
computer reservation systems had been affected as well as baggage
claim facilities.
   Airport personnel used flashlights to guide passengers through
darkened corridors and down stairways. No injuries were reported.
   The first of two power lines that feed the airport blew at 11:53
a.m., causing some areas to lose power.
   The system automatically restored power to those areas by
shifting the entire burden to the remaining line.
   Virginia Power officials said, however, that a few minutes after
noon someone in the airport inadvertently threw a switch that blew
the other circuit.
   The power failure lasted until about 4 p.m., officials said.

<HEAD>Incoming Washington Mayor Calls for $250 Million Spending Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor-elect Sharon Pratt Dixon is calling on
aides to draft plans for $250 million in spending cuts to fight
this city's burgeoning budget deficit without raising taxes, her
financial advisers say.
   Dixon, who takes her oath of office Wednesday, promised in her
campaign last fall that if elected she would not call for a tax
increase.
   Aides said Dixon, who succeeds outgoing Mayor Marion Barry,
hopes to lay the groundwork for an increase in federal aid to the
city by showing Congress and the White House she will back tough
spending cuts.
   ``She's going to try to show her bona fides before she asks for
help,'' top financial adviser Franklin D. Raines said.
   What Dixon wants increased is the $435 million federal payment
that is sent annually to the District of Columbia government to
help with the cost of running the city.
   The federal payment, which has not increased in five years, is
made in lieu of local taxes.
   Raines warned Dixon in a Dec. 21 memo that the deficit for the
fiscal year ending next Sept. 30 could reach $275 million to $300
million.
   Dixon has asked aides to find budget cuts totaling about $250
million, more than 6 percent of the city's $3.8 billion operating
budget.
   The incoming mayor said last week she expects the federal
government to substantially increase the annual payment. Many local
politicians have been claiming that the federal government has been
treating the city unfairly.
   Dixon said in her campaign that she could solve the budget
problem by eliminating waste and inefficiency and cutting 2,000 of
the 48,000 city workers. She said she did not believe it would
require cuts in programs and services.
   But Dixon may reconsider her support of pay raises for city
workers, Raines indicated. The city has planned for raises for
teachers, police officers and other city workers totaling roughly
$60 million to $80 million during the current fiscal year.

   The Texas House speaker was indicted on
charges he accepted $5,000 from a law firm and didn't disclose it,
joining legislative leaders in the two other most populous states
under an ethical cloud.
   House speakers in New York and California also are under
scrutiny as they prepare for new legislative sessions. The
investigation in Texas also involves other legislators.
   A Travis County grand jury returned indictments on two
misdemeanor charges Friday against Gib Lewis, alleging he solicited
and received a gift from the San Antonio-based law firm of Heard
Goggan Blair &amp; Williams, then failed to report it.
   Despite the charges, Lewis' lawyer said the lawmaker would seek
an unprecedented fifth term as House speaker. Lewis has denied the
allegations and his lawyer said he'd plead innocent to the charges.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Authorities blamed the first snowstorm of the
season for an electrical fire that trapped four rush-hour trains in
a smoke-filled subway tunnel, killing one person and injuring more
than 150 others.
   In Boston, authorities investigating a trolley accident that
injured 33 people Friday said tests showed the trolley driver had
high levels of alcohol in his system. It was the second rail
accident this month in the city's Back Bay section.
   The driver of the trolley, which rammed a streetcar that was
unloading passengers, blamed faulty brakes for the collision,
officials said. But investigators ruled that out as a possible
cause, said Peter Dimond, spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority.
   The fire Friday morning in New York filled trains with smoke in
a subway tunnel linking Manhattan and Brooklyn. Fire and transit
officials said melting snow from a 7-inch snowfall overnight
apparently caused an electrical short-circuit.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Dn Quayle doesn't abide
discrimination at golf clubs, his office says, but he still plays
at one of the most exclusive all-male courses near the capital as
an honorary member.
   Quayle on Friday canceled a second round of golf at the
all-white Cypress Point golf club near Monterey, Calif., after he
learned the facility was mired in a racial controversy, said his
press secretary, David Beckwith.
   He had played there Thursday, unaware, Beckwith said, that the
club was ruled ineligible for its share of the 1991 AT&amp;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am tournament next month because it has no black
members.
   Quayle was ``unwilling to leave any impression that he condones
any form of discrimination,'' so he left California and returned to
Vail, Colo., where he had been on a skiing vacation, Beckwith said.
   But the spokesman said he could not explain why Quayle is an
honorary member of the Burning Tree Club in suburban Bethesda, Md.,
which bars women from its course.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - California stopped telling casual marijuana
users ``smoke a joint, go to jail'' 15 years ago. But the federal
government's new version - ``smoke a joint, lose your driver's
license'' - promises to rekindle debate over the state's pot law.
   A little-noted amendment to a new federal highway funding law
seeks to use federal funding as a weapon against liberal state drug
laws. It would particularly affect California and New York because
of those states' relatively liberal marijuana laws and large
amounts of federal funding.
   The federal law calls for every state to pass a law in 1991-92
requiring a six-month driver license suspension for anyone
convicted of violating any drug law, including possession of
marijuana for personal use.
   States that refuse could lose 5 percent of their federal highway
aid in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, 1993. That would be $60
million at current levels of aid to California, said the
amendment's sponsor, Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y. The amendment
passed in July.
   Leaders of California's Democratic-controlled Legislature chafed
at the federal interference, but Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, a
Republican, agrees that the state's drug laws are too lenient.
Solomon's amendment lets a state avoid a monetary penalty only if
both the Legislature and the governor oppose the requirement of
license suspensions.

<TEXT>
   Just how bad a year was it for business?
   Ask Michael Milken. Or Donald Trump. Or Citicorp.
   By almost anyone's standard, 1990 failed to measure up. For the
start of a new decade, the year was particularly disappointing.
   It was a year of undoing and retreat, of dashed hopes and
unfulfilled promises. Fortunes were lost. Reputations were damaged.
Big deals fell apart.
   The economy slid into decline. The stock market hit a record
high and then tumbled downhill. Car sales slumped, and consumers
spent sparingly for Christmas.
   Homebuilding stalled, and real estate values in many parts of
the country plummeted.
   The buyouts of the '80s gave way to the bankruptcies of the '90s
as heavy debts pushed enterprises big and small to the brink of
collapse.
   Banks were left holding the bag for much of the mess, having
loaned billions for souring real estate deals and corporate
takeovers.
   The news turned bad even before Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, but
the ensuing crisis in the Persian Gulf added a ``war premium'' to
oil prices that drove up prices at the gasoline pump and stoked the
embers of inflation.
   It all inspired Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
pronounce ``a meaningful downturn'' in the economy near year's end,
although he stopped short of using the ``R'' word to proclaim an
official recession.
   The chairman of one hard-hit Wall Street firm was more blunt in
his assessment of the 1990 environment. ``Business stinks,'' George
Ball of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said in a November memo to
his staff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY: Slip-Sliding Into Recession</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government's regular monthly statistics on the economy
became a litany of woe in the waning weeks of the year.
   Unemployment reached 5.9 percent in November, a three-year high.
The index of leading economic indicators signaled the beginning of
a recession with five consecutive monthly declines beginning in
July.
   As construction slowed, sales of new homes dipped to their
lowest level since the last recession eight years ago.
   Manufacturing also languished. Just this past week, orders for
durable goods - items that last more than three years - were
reported off by 10.5 percent in November. The drop was viewed by
some economists as confirmation of a deepening recession.
   The lone break in the chain of bad news was a moderate inflation
report for November, which provided an opening for the Federal
Reserve to try to turn things around.
   The Fed, which can influence the fate of the economy by
regulating the nation's money supply, had been holding a tight rein
on credit to keep inflation under control. When inflation abated -
despite the lingering effects of the gulf crisis - the Fed took a
dramatic step to ease credit by lowering its lending rate to banks.
   The drop in the discount rate, by a half point to 6.5 percent,
was the first cut in the rate in more than four years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BANKS: Too Weak to Respond to the Medicine</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The medicine might have worked wonders under normal
circumstances. But the nation's banks were too weak to respond to
the dose of easier credit. Only a handful of banks lowered their
prime lending rates to business customers after the Fed's December
move.
   The biggest banks were busy shoring up their own finances. On
the same day the discount rate was cut, Citicorp, the nation's
largest bank, said it would set aside $340 million to cover bad
loans and cut up to 8,000 jobs.
   Many banks were shaky, and the cost of insuring bank deposits
against failures was skyrocketing. William Seidman, head of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said the insurance fund would lose
$9 billion through 1991, leaving just $4 billion to guarantee $2
trillion in deposits.
   The hard times were expected to prompt a wave of consolidation
in the industry that would leave fewer, stronger banks.

<HEAD>MARKETS: A Record Run Turns South</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One of the most depressing experiences of the year for
shareholders was watching the stock market's steady decline from
the exhilarating heights of a record close in July, a quarter point
shy of the 3,000 mark on the Dow Jones industrial average.
   The fall was precipitated, not by Saddam Hussein, but by a rash
of poor corporate earnings reports that preceded the Kuwait
invasion.
   The gulf crisis added oil price worries to the mix, and
corporate earnings looked even bleaker by the third quarter.
   Most of the action in the financial markets shifted to the oil
pits, where barrels of crude for future delivery are traded.
Frenzied speculation nearly doubled the price of a barrel of oil to
more than $40 by October, before it slid back under $30 toward
year's end.
   The conventional wisdom held that the world was awash in oil,
but the supply side of the equation mattered little, as long as the
threat of a shooting war in the Middle East loomed.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: Let's Not Make a Deal</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One missing ingredient in the markets was merger mania. It
departed with the '80s.
   Some big deals survived into the new decade, but they were few
and far between. With bank credit drying up and the market for junk
bonds exhausted, not much American money could be raised for
takeover wars.
   The biggest play was launched from Japan. Cash-rich Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. cut a $7.4 billion deal to buy
entertainment giant MCA Inc.
   Other deals were driven by necessity. American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., anxious to expand its computer business, tried to
reach out and grab NCR Corp. in a deal worth more than $6 billion.
NCR rejected the proposal and Ma Bell took its case directly to the
shareholders in the form of a tender offer.
   One high-profile deal fell apart, not for lack of financing but
for lack of a star player. Walt Disney Co. dropped its plans to
purchase Henson Associates Inc., home of the Muppets, following the
death of creative genius Jim Henson.
   In the airline business, deals became a way of life, but it was
a life of quiet desperation for some. Rising fuel prices and
sluggish traffic forced the weak to sell assets to the strong. Pan
Am Corp. peddled London routes to United Airlines, and Trans World
Airlines sold its London business to American Airlines. TWA then
made an offer to buy Pan Am.
   Meanwhile, Continental Airlines joined sister carrier Eastern
Airlines in bankruptcy court. Frank Lorenzo, who had paired these
carriers in the largest airline empire ever, disappeared almost
entirely from the scene, giving way to new regimes at Eastern and
Continental.

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Milken, Trump Make Biggest Headlines</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In a year of fading fortunes, the business anti-hero rated the
largest headlines. Michael Milken and Donald Trump, rising stars of
the '80s, became even more famous as fallen angels in the '90s.
   Milken, who popularized the use of debt to bankroll big
corporate deals, pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges, agreed
to pay fines and restitution of $600 million, and was sentenced to
10 years in prison. Drexel Burnham Lambert, the securities firm he
rode to greatness, filed for protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court.
   Trump, who used debt like steroids to pump up his casino and
real estate empire, tumbled with the economy and spent much of the
year fending off his creditors. Along the way, another costly
venture came unraveled: his marriage.
   The mighty-turned-miserable had plenty of company. For the first
time ever, the minimumm amount of money needed to make Forbes
magazine's list of the 400 richest Americans went down.
   Anyone with $260 million still qualified.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's largest electrical company on
Saturday closed its $6.6 billion purchase of entertainment colossus
MCA Inc., completing the largest Japanese acquisition of an
American firm.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. acquired about 77.7 million
shares of MCA stock at $66 per share, Matsushita said in a
statement. Its acquisitions amount to about 97 percent f
outstanding MCA shares.
   The buyout matches Matsushita's electronics products with MCA's
movie and music empire. MCA runs Universal Studios, maker of such
films as ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestial,'' and ``Jaws.'' The firm
holds recording contracts with such artists as Guns N' Roses and
Elton John and produces the television programs ``Murder, She
Wrote'' and ``Major Dad.''
   Matsushita products are marketed in the United States through
such brand names as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.
   MCA will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Matsushita and all
remaining MCA stockholders will be entitled to receive $66 in cash
for each share still held, the statement said.
   Legal obstacles were removed Friday, when a federal judge in Los
Angeles rejected a bid by MCA shareholders seeking to block the
sale. The lawsuit contended that MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman was
violating Securities and Exchange Commission rules by receiving
tax-free stock transfers as part of the deal.
   Wasserman alone is to receive a new preferred Matsushita stock
that saves him $100 million in capital gains taxes and additional
estate taxes.
   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real did not dismiss the lawsuit, but
said there was insufficient evidence presented to block the
transaction.
   In a separate case, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
denied a last-minute motion in an antitrust suit filed by Go-Video
Inc., maker of dual-deck VCRs.
