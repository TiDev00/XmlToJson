   Driftnets meant to catch tuna and squid are
sweeping up and killing huge numbers of other fish and birds that
are just thrown away, the leaders of a Greenpeace Foundation
protest voyage said Thursday.
   In a news conference following the return of the Rainbow Warrior
from a Pacific voyage, expedition leader Ben Deeble said the crew
had found at least 30 species of dolphins, birds and fish dead or
dying in the huge driftnets.
   Shark alone accounted for 30 percent of the catch in one net,
Deeble said.
   ``Generally, they cut the fins off the sharks and throw the rest
away,'' said Roger Grace of Auckland, New Zealand, an underwater
photographer on the mission.
   Pomfret, a small but tasty fish, ``is thrown away by the
thousands,'' Grace said.
   The group plans to use videotapes and photographs of marine life
caught in a plastic monofilament mesh and a 3-mile driftnet that it
seized to campaign for tougher sanctions by the United States and
United Nations against driftnet fishing.
   ``I think the video is the most complete ever shot of the
(driftnet) fleet,'' Grace said.
   Deeble said the Rainbow Warrior crew saw or monitored on radar
about 200 of the more than 1,000 driftnet vessels from Japan,
Taiwan and Korea believed to be operating in the North Pacific.
   He said plans were being made to unfurl the seized net in the
downtown area of a U.S. city, a process he said would require about
200 people.
   ``I think that's one reason we've had so much trouble getting
these driftnets banned,'' he said. ``People can't comprehend the
size of these things.''
   The Rainbow Warrior, a 181-foot converted trawler, departed July
19 from Hawaii with 32 people on a six-week mission covering more
than 6,000 miles to monitor and protest driftnet fishing for tuna
and squid.
   The nets hang like a curtain more than 30 feet below the surface
and stretch as far as 35 miles. Critics say they indiscriminately
trap and kill fish, thousands of marine mammals and 800,000 birds a
year.
   At times the protesters brought inflatable motorized launches
close enough to the fishing vessels to see the faces of the crew,
Deeble said.
   He said he was invited aboard a Taiwanese ship and had dinner
with the skipper.
   ``It was a very sociable meeting where we discussed our views on
driftnets,'' Deeble said. ``He's looking at changing his technology
... changing to long lines to fish for tuna.''
   The skipper claimed he caught no whales and rarely found marine
mammals or birds in the nets although those aboard the Rainbow
Warrior saw dolphins and many birds being hauled aboard, Deeble
said.
   A federal judge in San Francisco on Tuesday ordered a ban on
imports of tuna caught by five nations until they can show that
they are not killing more dolphins than U.S. law allows.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said the Bush
administration had given foreign fleets too much time to comply
with a 1988 federal law requiring an embargo of any nation whose
dolphin-killing rate was more than twice the rate of the U.S. tuna
fleet.
   Some commercial fishing fleets deliberately drop their nets on
dolphins, which swim above yellowfin tuna.

   Ayatollah Marashi Najafi, one of Iran's
top Islamic authorities, has died of a heart attack, Tehran radio
reported Thursday. He was 96.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said he died Wednesday in
his home in Qom, an Islamic holy city in western Iran.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared a three-day
national mourning period in Najafi's memory.
   Najafi was born in 1894 the city of Najaf, Iraq.
   He came to Iran in 1923 on a pilgrimage to the shrine of the
Shiite Moslem saint Imam Reza.
   After a three-month stay in Tehran, he was invited to teach at
the renowned Qom Theological Seminary.
   He remained in Iran and came to be regarded as a grand
ayatollah, or supreme Shiite Moslem authority, in recognition of
his learning.
   During his years in Iran, Najafi wrote many treatises on Islam
and Shiism.

   Leaders of a Capitol rally Thursday demanded
that the governor and Legislature decriminalize drugs as suggested
in an advisory panel report, parts of which were barred from
publication by the attorney general.
   ``It's censorship. And he has the nerve to call himself a
liberal,'' shouted rally coordinator Richard Geiselhart. ``We don't
need a war on drugs. We need a war on greed, corruption, waste and
stupidity, but above all we need a war on hypocrisy.''
   Regina Birdsell, a spokeswoman for Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, denied the allegation of censorship. She said recommendations
of decriminalization were deleted because they were contained in
individual members' statements and not in a collective panel
opinion.
   The seven-member commission was created by the Legislature to
study drug abuse and possible remedies, Birdsell said. Its report
explains where people can write for the individual panel members'
opinions, she said.
   Panel members said they recommended that the Legislature
legalize cultivation of marijuana for personal use, consider
decriminalization of other drugs on an individual basis and
legalize possession of hypodermic needles.
   The state panel said current anti-drug laws have been
``manifestly unsuccessful in that we are now using more and a
greater variety of drugs, legal and illegal.''
   Many of the 300 people who flocked to the noon rally outside the
state Capitol sported long hair and the tie-dyed look of the 1960s.
Marijuana smoke wafted through the crowd.
   Speakers from the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws
and other groups said laws against drugs are unconstitutional and
do more harm than good.
   Eric Garris of Mountain View, a Republican candidate for the
state Assembly, drew a huge cheer from the crowd when he said he
was running for office on a platform of decriminalizing drugs.
   ``All the money, time and energy we spend on this
unconstitutional, unworkable hypocrisy via law enforcement, courts
and prisons should be spent to help take the despair out of
peoples' lives through education, job training, jobs, affordable
housing and medical care,'' Geiselhart said.
   A large federal raid of marijuana plantations in the mountains
180 miles northeast of San Francisco last month drew criticism from
many local officials, who said it achieved little other than to
anger residents who said they were mernaced by Army troops toting
automatic weapons.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Says He'll Launch Conservation Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will raise domestic oil
production and launch its first energy conservation advertising
campaign in more than a decade, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
said in Friday's New York Times.
   He described the campaign as a response to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The United States imported about 700,000 barrels a day from Iraq
and Kuwait before the United Nations embargo went into place. That
will be made up by December by increasing production from Prudhoe
Bay in Alaska, Watkins said in an interview.
   The Energy Department also is seeking another 30,000 barrels a
day from Texas and 50,000 barrels more from companies that have
developed oil reserves off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif.
   The new advertising campaign will begin in mid-September. It
will urge Americans to conserve oil by doing things like inflating
their tires to the maximum pressure, driving more fuel-efficient
cars and observing speed limits.
   If everyone responded to those measures, almost 200,000 barrels
of oil could be saved daily, Watkins said.
   The department also will promote the use of gasohol. Drivers of
the Energy Department's more than 12,000 cars and trucks were
directed Thursday to begin buying alcohol-blended fuels in an
experiment to measure fuel savings.
   Watkins said he hoped the program would ``send signals to the
private sector that we'd like them to do likewise.''
   The department has decided not to speed up its drafting a new
national energy policy for making the country more fuel
self-sufficient.
   That policy is to be delivered to the White House in December
and to Congress in the spring.

   A Chinese businessman's association has been
indicted on charges it ran a multimillion-dollar illegal gambling
operation from several U.S. cities, the federal government
announced Thursday.
   The 34-count indictment names the National On Leong Chinese
Merchants Association in New York and its Chicago, Houston and New
York Chapters, as well as 29 individuals, said Fred L. Foreman,
U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois.
   ``The National On Leong ... directed and controlled illegal
casino-style gambling games such as fan tan, pai gow and 13 card
maintained by several of the local chapters,'' said the 98-page
indictment handed down Wednesday.
   The 29 individuals are listed as residents of Detroit,
Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Houston, Atlanta, Chicago and New York,
according to a statement released with the document.
   The group allgedly used a New York street gang, the Ghost
Shadows, for protection and to resolve disputes.
   The association and some of the individuals were charged with
racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to bribe a witness and
conspiracy to bribe a Chicago area judge.
   Some also were charged with illegal gambling and conspiracy to
defraud the U.S. government by obstructing the Internal Revenue
Service.
   The government sought to seize On Leong buildings in Chicago,
New York and Houston, as well as $11.5 million in proceeds the
indictment said came from illegal gambling.
   Foreman said in a telephone interview that On Leong has run a
gambling operation for at least six years and that the indictments
resulted from a 2{-year investigation.

   There were no injuries or release of radiation and the plant
continued operating during Thursday's incident, said Duquesne Light
Co., the plant's operator.
   The release occurred during maintenance testing of valves, one
of which leaked carbon dioxide and decreased the oxygen level below
safe levels, Duquesne said. Oxygen levels returned to normal after
the area was vented, the utility said.
   The alert lasted two hours. An alert is the second lowest of

<HEAD>What's Missing from Maine Lunch Boxes? `Aseptic' Packaging</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A back-to-school quiz: What lunch box
fixture will be history in school lunchrooms across Maine?
   Answer: The juice box, that soft-sided, single-serving
container. The Legislature has outlawed it because the bonded
layers of plastic, paper and aluminum that keep the contents fresh
defy recycling.
   Maine's unique ban on sale of most beverages in aseptic
packaging takes effect Saturday, just as children prepare to return
to school and parents think about what to pack in their kids' lunch
boxes.
   While the timing of the law was, by all accounts, coincidental,
it has left parents scrambling to replace the drinks packed in
convenient 8{-ounce containers that come with straws.
   ``I don't know what we're going to do,'' said Linda Ball of
Portland, as her 3-year-old son, Billy, selected a three-pack of
fruit juice at a supermarket. ``Those glass things,'' she said,
pointing to a nearby display of single-serving juice bottles.
``We're afraid they'll hurt his teeth.''
   Still, Ms. Ball and other parents who stocked up on the popular
juice boxes before the ban took effect indicated they were prepared
to sacrifice convenience in order to counter the state's buildup of
solid waste.
   ``I'm concerned about the environment, so I'll make do with
something else if it's that much of a problem,'' she said.
   Supermarkets say they will no longer have the same variety of
fruit juices and punches available. Cans or bottles take up more
shelf space and have higher handling costs than ``brick packs'' of
boxes.
   ``We estimate that it's going to cost consumers in Maine about
17 cents more per unit _ for each single item they purchase,'' said
Margaret McEwen, consumer information director at Shaw's
Supermarkets.
   Juice boxes have surged in popularity since they were introduced
to American supermarkets in the early 1980s. Their advantages are
obvious: less weight, unbreakable, safer than metal or glass, easy
to stash in backpacks and lunch boxes, and easily crushed and
discarded.
   But juice boxes have become a prime target of environmentalists
because they replace containers that can be recycled easily with
current technology, observed Jeanne Wirka of the Environmental
Action Foundation in Washington, D.C.
   Maine, with a goal of recycling half its solid waste by 1994,
banned the boxes in an expansion of a law enacted more than a
decade ago to require deposits on bottles and cans of soda and beer.
   The revised law made all beverage containers, except those used
for dairy products, subject to deposits. Liquor bottles came under
the law last January, wine bottles become returnable on Saturday
and all other non-carbonated beverages will require deposits by
year's end.
   The only brick packs permitted under the new law are those that
contain milk products or juice concentrates.
   Tetra Pak Inc., the company that pioneered ``aseptic''
packaging, says juice boxes are environmentally sound because they
are lighter and smaller than bottles and cans.
   ``We have so much less material in our packages that it creates
a lot less waste,'' said Edward Klein, Tetra Pak's vice president
for environmental affairs.
   Juice boxes remain legal in the other 49 states. Lawmakers in
Massachusetts and Vermont last year rejected bans. Rhode Island
took a different tack, enacting a bill that requires the aseptic
packaging industry to work with the state to develop a pilot
recycling program.
   Recycling projects also are under way in Massachusetts, New York
and Canada as well as in Rhode Island, Klein said.
   Sharon Treat of the Natural Resources Council, which fought to
include the ban in Maine's law, expressed skepticism about such
pilot projects, saying they turn out a compound for which there may
be only limited demand.

   Labor unrest is growing in Brazil, and
acquiring a tone of violence and sabotage that could threaten the
government's ambitious anti-inflation program.
   If his members continue to lose buying power, said union leader
Vicente Paulo da Silva, the result might be a ``major social
convulsion with unpredictable consequences.''
   In late July, hundreds of auto workers went on a three-day
rampage at the Sao Paulo subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., where a
strike shut down production for more than a month. They destroyed
more than 50 cars, smashed windows and doors and set fires in the
plant administration buildings.
   A strike by power workers this month caused a 10-hour blackout
in Brasilia, the capital, and shut off electricity for two hours in
the northeastern state of Bahia. In Brasilia, the lights went out
in government ministries and the residence of President Fernando
Collor de Mello.
   Ozires Silva, infrastructure minister of the national
government, told reporters ``signs of sabotage'' were found at
power stations and authorities might sue the power workers' union
for damages.
   Labor leaders say the violence is a sign of rebellion against
the pay restrictions Collor's government contends are vital to its
anti-inflation plan.
   ``The incidents at Ford were merely a sign of the future
violence that could erupt as a result of the workers' despair,'' da
Silva, president of the Sao Bernardo do Campo Metalworkers Union,
said in an interview. ``Their wages are not enough to feed, clothe,
educate or house their children decently.''
   Most foreign-owned auto plants are in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an
industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center and
largest city. Da Silva's union, which says it represents 140,000
workers, is considered Brazil's most militant and politicized.
   Da Silva said the government was ``trying to control inflation
by provoking recession and unemployment, and slashing our
purchasing power.''
   More than 500 strikes have occurred since Collor announced a
radical austerity program March 16, one day after taking office,
aimed at reducing annual inflation of nearly 5,000 percent.
   His plan included an 18-month freeze on savings and money market
accounts, elimination of subsidies and incentives, the sale of
government mansions and cars, and mass layoffs of public employees.
   Inflation came down from nearly 100 percent a month to about 11
percent in July, but the economy headed toward recession, and
unemployment soared.
   The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics said nearly
1 million employees of private companies had lost their jobs since
March 16 and more than 100,000 federal employees had been dismissed.
   Industrial output dropped 7.1 percent during the first six
months of 1990, said the institute, whose statistics the government
considers official.
   In May, Collor's government ended automatic cost-of-living wage
adjustments and said workers must negotiate pay raises with
employers. Indexed pay increases had been a traditional Brazilian
hedge against inflation.
   Hundreds of thousands of workers have gone on strike in an
effort to recover at least part of the purchasing power lost to
inflation.
   Labor leaders want raises of more than 100 percent for their
members to compensate for the wild inflation before Mar. 16.
   ``These losses must be replaced in the worker's paycheck,'' da
Silva said. ``Then we could negotiate real wage hikes based on
productivity.
   ``The government must adopt a wage policy that guarantees wages
will be adjusted to inflation.''
   Collor said in a radio interview he would veto any congressional
attempt to reinstate automatic wage adjustments because they would
``plunge Brazil back into a hyperinflationary spiral.''
   Workers interviewed by The Associated Press said raises obtained
through negotiations had not closed the gap.
   Josemar de Medeiros, a 30-year-old maintenance worker at Ford,
got a 59 percent raise after the strike and earns the equivalent of
$915 a month. That is excellent pay in Brazil, where the monthly
minimum wage is about $62.
   ``This salary makes me a member of the elite of Brazil's work
force, yet I can't buy new clothes for my children, can't pay a
day-care center, can barely pay the rent for a cramped two-bedroom
apartment and can't even dream of buying what I help produce,''
Medeiros said.
   Millions of lower-paid workers are in serious trouble, he said,
and told a reporter: ``Our purchasing power is declining day by day
and we are angry. If this situation continues, the wave of strikes
will certainly grow.''
   Some economists are puzzled by the widespread labor trouble.
During a recession, they say, workers usually are more concerned
with keeping their jobs than getting more pay.
   Da Silva's response: ``Workers are fed up with footing the bill
for economic stabilization programs. The mass dismissals and the
loss in purchasing power prove the Collor government lied when it
said its austerity program would not sacrifice the working class.
   ``Today, the worker feels he has nothing to lose except his fear
of getting fired, and he's losing that rapidly.''

<TEXT>
   The serial killings in Gainesville, Fla.,
recall the terror that gripped Californians during the ``Night
Stalker'' murders, a reign that ended five years ago today.
   On Aug. 31, 1985, Texas drifter Richard Ramirez was captured by
an angry mob that recognized him from news photos, capping a summer
of random, nocturnal attacks.
   The grisly string of satanic crimes still haunts the legal
system and those who became entwined in one of the most complex
prosecutions ever.
   ``It's not over. People think because they're not reading it in
the paper anymore that it's over,'' said Deputy District Attorney
P. Philip Halpin, whose career became captive to the Ramirez case.
``There will be many more anniversaries before this case reaches
its resolution, unfortunately.''
   The appeal process has just begun for the 30-year-old Ramirez,
convicted of 13 murders and 30 felonies. Ramirez also faces trial
soon in San Francisco in a single slaying there.
   In spite of winning Ramirez's conviction and death sentence last
September, Halpin remains assigned to the case full-time. He works
in an office filled with transcripts of marathon court proceedings
for use in the appeal, which is automatic in death-penalty cases.
   How long will it take to resolve the appeal? ``We're talking
years,'' said Halpin.
   Ramirez is being held in the county jail in San Francisco, where
Deputy District Attorney Eugene Sweeters said, ``He hasn't caused
any trouble there as far as I know.''
   Ramirez's reign of terror ended when East Los Angeles residents
captured him after he tried to pull a woman from her car. By the
time police arrived, a crowd was shouting ``Kill him! Kill him!''
Officers formed a human chain to protect Ramirez from the mob.
   Residents said the ``Night Stalker'' held all of them captive
throughout that steamy summer when they kept windows and doors shut
tight in fear.
   As in the Gainesville slayings, it was through unlocked windows
and doors, that the Stalker entered homes. He raped, killed and
mutilated his victims.
   A woman's eyes were gouged out after she was killed by the
``Night Stalker.'' A man was murdered in his bed and his wife was
raped beside the dead body.
   There were signs of devil worship _ a pentagram drawn on the
wall at one murder scene and survivors' accounts of being ordered
to ``swear to Satan.''
   A preliminary hearing in 1986 disclosed the horror of the
victims' ordeals and resulted in witness-stand identifications of
Ramirez as the killer.
   Legal maneuvers by a series of defense attorneys delayed
Ramirez's trial. A succession of judges presided before Superior
Court Judge Michael Tynan took charge and saw the case through a
yearlong trial.
   At the very end, a juror was slain during deliberations. Defense
lawyers sought a mistrial, but the judge ruled the killing in a
domestic dispute was unrelated to the case and ordered jurors to
proceed. They recommended the death penalty, which Tynan imposed.
   Ramirez passed up the opportunity to testify, preventing
hoped-for glimpses of the killer's mind and motivation. He chose to
remain a mystery, spouting slogans of devil-worship.
   ``I am beyond good and evil. I will be avenged. Lucifer dwells
in us all. That's it,'' Ramirez said before he was led off to
prison.
   Halpin said he has concluded the serial killer was really a
small-time burglar out of control.
   He noted that Ramirez failed to fit the usual serial killer
profile of someone who always kills with the same weapon and whose
victims are similar.
   Halpin suggested that investigators in the Gainesville case may
be facing problems similar to those that stymied the ``Night
Stalker'' task force for months.
   ``Frankly, law enforcement wasn't ready for a `Night Stalker,'''
said Halpin. ``Every study of serial murderers led to conclusions
that didn't apply to this case.''

   Militant attitudes may be the new fashion
for many Americans, but townsfolk here are chewing over a proposal
to muzzle ``fighting words'' on the streets of this college enclave.
   The proposal, designed to silence racial slurs, is part of a
long line of efforts to promote harmony in a town that has voted
against every war since 1812. It is already drawing fire from civil
rights advocates.
   ``This is a caring community. It's a community of people who
really have some deep and genuine humane values,'' said Paul
Rogers, a member of the Citizens Review Committee, which has
written a first draft of the bylaw.
   Rogers said he's not sure whether the proposal will succeed. It
was inspired by an incident last May in which a white youth
reportedly shouted racial slurs and knocked a black teen-ager down.
   In Amherst, a town of about 34,000 where residents have marched
for peace and against war scores of times, debating Constitutional
rights is nothing new.
   A University of Massachusetts at Amherst sociology professor
credited the nature of Amherst politics to old-fashioned Yankee
outspokenness at regular and well-attended Town Meetings and having
two colleges and the university.
   ``These are people who are familiar with the use of the tongue
in a situation politically which puts a premium on it,'' said Jay
Demerath.
   In keeping with tradition, a group of residents this month
marched to the Town Common to protest U.S. military buildup in
Saudi Arabia and suggest that President Bush turn to alternate
methods to resolve the invasion of Kuwait.
   Two years ago, a group of senior citizens staged a sit-in at the
University of Massachusetts chancellor's office to protest research
on the anthrax disease that they feared could somehow be put to
militaristic use.
   The proposal doesn't give a list of ``fighting words.'' It
defines them as those that ``by their very utterance inflict injury
upon the person or group of persons to whom they are directed or
which tend to incite an immediate breach of peace.''
   John Roberts, head of the Civil Liberties Union in Boston, said
the proposal is a bad idea.
   ``Obviously it's well-intentioned,'' he said, noting that racial
harassment is on the rise. ``It is ugly and you want to deal with
it. I think this is not a way to deal with it.''
   Rogers said the bylaw doesn't apply to expression of ideas, but
rather to certain offensive forms of speech. He likened prosecution
for shouting racial slurs to a people who get too raucous at a
late-night party.
   ``If we can regulate hooting and hollering and whistling we can
certainly regulate these kinds of words that are not protected by
the Constitution,'' he said. ``I know people are going to be
concerned about protecting free speech and they ought to be.''
   The proposal may go before a Town Meeting this fall if it gets
approval from Town Counsel Alan Seewald, who declined comment on
the bylaw Thursday.
   The bylaw's wording comes from a 1942 Supreme Court case,
Chaplinsky vs. New Hampshire, in which a state law prohibiting use
of ``fighting words'' was upheld, Rogers said. In that case a
selectman had referred to a man as a ``damn fascist,'' he said.
   But Roberts said that case applies to specific confrontations,
which are already prohibited under civil rights statutes.
   ``I think they're going to be in trouble,'' he said.

   Few nightclub comics have the nerve to
jump off the stage and snatch a steak from a fan at a front-row
table.
   Winston the Wonder Dog did.
   Winston's routine was not sophisticated; dog acts rarely are.
But his impression of Barbara Bush was a crowd pleaser. And
audiences roared when he lay on his back and punched the air with
boxing glove-clad feet.
   The Old English sheepdog who traveled the nation's comedy clubs
and college campuses for six years, died at Wednesday at age 11.
   ``He was the straight guy, and I just had to make whatever he
did funny,'' Seattle comedian Earl Burks said Thursday as he
prepared for his first show since Winston's death.
   Winston was humanely destroyed by a Henderson veterinarian after
suffering symptoms of old age that forced his retirement four
months ago and worsened steadily since, Burks said. A younger
sheepdog took over Winston's act.
   Winston the Wonder Dog performed in Las Vegas, 47 states and
Canada, where he once spent a night in jail and entertained the
local police, Burks said.
   The dog's photograph appeared in Rolling Stone and People
magazine and dozens of local newspapers. He was on the nationally
televised show ``Star Search.''
   Winston's talents included dancing on his hind legs and
``answering'' questions, such as ``What's the top of a house
called?'' Answer: ``Roof.''
   ``It was just real stupid but it was funny,'' Burks said.
``Sometimes when he would bark into the microphone he would just
keep on and on, because he could hear himself. It was so goofy that
people would laugh.''
   With a wardrobe of wigs, sunglasses and masks, Winston also
impersonated the political personalities of the day, including the
Ayatollah Khomeini and the first lady, and celebrities such as
Sammy Davis Jr., Stevie Wonder and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
   The shaggy gray-and-white dog's large, pliable mouth leant
itself to manipulation by Burks, whose humor sometimes took a bawdy
turn.
   Burks bought Winston as a puppy. When he needed material to fill
time at a comedy club, someone suggested he take his pet on stage.
   ``There was a guy at a front table with a big steak,'' Burks
said. ``I turned my back and he was up on this guy's table eating
this steak. They were laughing and applauding and I was thinking,
`Oh no, I'm gonna get sued.'''
   A dog star was born.

Paychecks</HEAD>

   The families of some American oil workers trapped
in Iraq or Kuwait have another worry: A company says it can't
afford to keep paying their salaries.
   At least six contract workers for the OGE Drilling Inc. remain
in Kuwait or Iraq. Ten other workers and their dependents left,
according to T.B. O'Brien, president of O'Brien, Goins, Simpson
Inc. in Midland. OGE Drilling is its Houston subsidiary.
   ``You've got to understand, we're not a big company,'' O'Brien
said Thursday. ``Essentially, 90 percent of its income and business
is business in Kuwait. Now it's not a company. That company is
broke because we are out about $470,000 that hasn't been paid to
us.''
   OGE provided drilling supervisors and superintentents to Kuwait
Oil Co. and Kuwait National Petroleum Co. for 10 years. Both
companies were owned by the goverment of Kuwait, which was
dissolved after Iraq invaded the neighboring country on Aug. 2.
   ``Our contract with these people terminated when our contract
with Kuwait Oil Company terminated,'' O'Brien said. ``That's just
the way the contract was written. And the company doesn't have any
money to pay them.''
   He said if the company tried to absorb the loss, soon it
wouldn't be able to pay the stranded workers or its other 40
employees.
   ``It's not by our choice that any of them were there. We have a
number of them who used good judgment to get out and a number used
poor judgment to stay and two got captured and didn't have any
choice in the matter.''
   O'Brien said the stranded workers included people from Texas,
Louisiana and Canada. Two were taken to Baghdad and four, plus a
worker's wife, are believed to have remained in Kuwait.
   O'Brien said his company is going directly to Kuwait Petroleum
Co., which has set up operations in London, to try to get its
payment. He also is seeking guidance from the Texas Employment
Commission in hopes of getting the workers unemployment benefits
from the state.
   Bill Grossenbacher of the Texas Employment Commission said the
state has asked for information on the workers and will examine
each case.
   ``There may be a way we could interpret our laws so some of
these individuals could qualify. If so, we would mail their checks
to their families,'' he said from Austin.
   The checks would amount to no more than $214 per week.
   ``That wouldn't even begin to touch our responsibilities,'' said
Patricia Hale, of nearby Spring, whose husband, Edward, is being
held. ``I really don't know yet what I'm going to do. I have no
other income.
   Donnita Cole, of Odessa, whose husband, John, is a captive, said
$214 ``won't even pay my telephone bill.''
   ``I just can't believe they would do this to us. I never heard
of a company that would do this to dependents,'' she said. ``My
husband did not quit and did not get laid off, so there's no need
to call the Texas Employment Commission.''

   A prosecutor was shot in the head and killed
Thursday in a drive-by slaying as he picked up doughnuts at a store
near the Bronx County Courthouse, but authorities said he was not
the target of the gunman.
   Also Thursday, a former state senator, 49-year-old Vander
Beatty, was fatally shot in his office in the Brooklyn borough.
   The prosecutor, 30-year-old Sean Healy, was hit once as he bent
over to take a box of doughnuts from a store shelf, said Michael
Philbin, chief of Bronx detectives.
   ``He certainly was not a target. He happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time,'' Philbin said.
   Philbin said police had been summoned to a location a block from
the store about an hour before the shooting but no one was there
when they arrived. He said police theorized that the shooting and
the dispute were linked but they did not know for certain.
   Late Thursday, a suspect in the shooting voluntarily surrendered
to police in the Bronx and was being questioned, said Officer Mark
Warren, a police spokesman. No charges were brought immediately,
Warren said.
   Beatty's killing was announced by Mayor David Dinkins, who has
campaigned recently against firearms.
   ``Somehow, we're going to have to get the citizenry of this
country outraged at the proliferation of guns,'' Dinkins said,
after a news conference at City Hall.
   Beatty, a Democrat who left the state senate after being
convicted of forgery and racketeering in 1984, was shot once in the
head at his office.
   Police spokesman Tina Mohrmann said Beatty was killed by an
unidentified man who fled in a blue Oldsmobile.
   Former U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm, with whom Beatty feuded
politically over Brooklyn matters, learned about her former
colleague's death from a reporter.
   ``Oh, God. On the eve of his election coming up,'' Chisholm
said, referring to Beatty's run for district leader in his old
senatorial district. ``I just got the shock of my life.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II arrives
Saturday on the start of a four-nation African tour to be climaxed
by the blessing of a huge, costly and controversial basilica in
Ivory Coast.
   The trip, which will take the pope across the bulge of the
continent, will be his 49th foreign tour and his seventh visit to
Africa, where declining economies and rapidly rising populations
spell misery for millions.
   As in previous visits, the pope is expected to call for
Christian harmony and preach against artificial birth control and
extramarital sex, with its attendant threat of AIDS, a particularly
deadly scourge in Africa.
   The World Health Organization estimates 5 million sub-Saharan
Africans are infected with the virus that can cause the disease.
That is double the number three years ago.
   Pope John Paul will carry his messages from Dar es Salaam to
three other major cities in Tanzania, an East Africa nation of
about 23 million people. Most of them are Moslems. About 20 percent
of Tanzanians subscribe to the Roman Catholic faith.
   After five days in Tanzania, he will fly to Burundi and Rwanda,
tiny neighboring and predominantly Catholic countries to the
northwest. They are the most densly populated nations in Africa and
their recent history has been marked by clashes between their two
main ethnic groups, the Hutus and the Tutsis.
   The pope will spend two nights each in Burundi and Rwanda before
going across the continent to Ivory Coast, where he will end his
trip Sept. 10 by consecrating the immense Basilica of Our Lady of
Peace.
   Rivaling St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican in size, the
structure was built by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny in his
hometown of Yamoussoukro. The government said it cost $133 million.
Critics say the real cost could be twice as high and bemoan the
extravagance in a country undergoing its worst economic crisis in
30 years of independence. Only about 11 percent of Ivory Coast's 11
million residents are Catholics, with the majority practicing
native, tribal religions.
   Houphouet-Boigny has said he is paying for the basilica out of
his own pocket. Published reports have alleged the sale of 16,000
state-owned apartments helped cover the cost.
   Pope John Paul initially refused to bless the basilica, which
was completed last September after four years of work. But in June,
the Vatican said the pope had relented, noting at the same time
that Houphouet-Boigny had agreed to build a hospital next to the
basilica.
   The basilica is modeled after St. Peter's and is the only one in
Africa. With a seating capacity of 7,000 people and standing room
for 11,000 more, it also is the continent's biggest center for
Christian worship.

   Amin, a Palestinian
electrician who fled Kuwait after working there for 21 years,
returned home this week with three small bags and little hope for
the future.
   It was the second time Amin had fled a military occupation. The
first time was after the Israeli conquest of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``This time it's more difficult for us than in 1967,'' said Amin
on Wednesday, noting that he lost $65,000 in savings and property
in Kuwait and had little chance of finding a job in his hometown of
Ramallah in the West Bank.
   Amin, who would only give his first name, said he hoped to
return to Kuwait but was fearful political turmoil would keep him
away. He is one of thousands of Palestinians set wandering by the
gulf crisis, and many have no home to go to.
   Amin is one of the lucky ones since he has the Israel-issued
permit needed to live in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian
leaders estimate that of the 320,000 Palestinians in Kuwait, only
about 100,000 have permits to live in the occupied lands. Many
others are stuck in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   ``Seventy percent of the Palestinians in Kuwait have refugee
documents. They have no home to turn to, no resident status in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, no place to go,'' said Saeb Erakat, a
pro-PLO West Bank university lecturer and newspaper editor.
   Zuhaira Kamal, another prominent West Bank Palestinian, added:
``They have to stay in Kuwait. If there is war, it will be a danger
for everyone.''
   Israeli military officials said they are issuing short-term
visitors' visas to Palestinians without residence permits but will
not let them return permanently to live with relatives in the
occupied territories.
   ``They can come to these areas as visitors. After three months,
they should leave. If we reach the conclusion that it is a real
humanitarian case, we could extend the visit for another month or
two,'' said Brig. Gen. Freddy Zach, deputy coordinator for policies
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Zach said the number of Palestinians in Kuwait with
Israeli-issued residence permits was only 30,000.
   He spoke to reporters during an army-arranged tour of the
Allenby Bridge, a rickety wooden crossing over the Jordan River
that divides Jordan and the West Bank.
   One of those making the trip from Jordan on Wednesday was
69-year-old Rifka al Kurd of Jerusalem.
   She had traveled to Amman shortly after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait to find out about her son Nabil, a 46-year-old Health
Ministry official in Kuwait, and daughter Nabiha, a 38-year-old
teacher.
   Mrs. Kurd said she was unable to make contact with her children
and decided to return home.
   ``I cannot sleep at night, I'm very worried and very sad,'' said
Mrs. Kurd as she waited for an Israeli soldier to dump the contents
of her suitcase on a table and check the items one by one.
   Both Nabil and Nabiha were born in Arab east Jerusalem but were
outside the country during the 1967 Middle East war and a
subsequent Israeli census of the occupied lands. Only those present
for the census are entitled to residence permits.
   Mrs. Kurd said she has applied for permits for her children
repeatedly but was always turned down.
   Like many other Palestinians in Kuwait, Nabil and Nabiha have
Jordanian passports. But the invasion left them stranded without
money needed to start a new life in Jordan, and there are few jobs
in the kingdom.
   Another Palestinian caught without papers is Bassel Ishtayeh,
31, a math teacher in Kuwait. Even though he was born in Kuwait,
Ishtayeh was denied citizenship and passports by the Kuwaitis.
   Ishtayeh, his wife and 1-year-old son were visiting his wife's
family in the West Bank village of Salfit near Nablus when Iraq
invaded Kuwait. Mrs. Ishtayeh and her son have West Bank residence
permits, but her Kuwaiti-born husband does not.
   With his tourist visit expiring next week, he could move to
Jordan on his Jordanian passport but would have to leave behind his
wife and child who as West Bank residents do not have the right to
live in Jordan.

   Investigators have been dispatched
across the state to question possible suspects in the grisly
slayings of five students that have paralyzed this college town,
police said Thursday.
   Lt. Sadie Darnell, a Gainesville police spokeswoman, said some
of the 600 law enforcement officials involved in a manhunt for the
killer have been dispatched around the state to speak to suspects
jailed for other crimes.
   Others were examining reports of other crimes, including a gory
slashing in Ohio earlier this month.
   But ``we don't see an imminent arrest,'' Lt. Spencer Mann of the
Alachua County Sheriff's Department cautioned. Police do not have a
``hot suspect,'' he said.
   Authorities were especially eager to find a man identified as
Warren Virgil Tinch, of Franklin, Ohio, who is wanted for the
stabbing death and mutilation of a 52-year-old Middletown, Ohio,
woman, according to The Gainesville Sun.
   Witnesses allegedly spotted Tinch, 58, in Gainesville and nearby
Ocala about a week before the five murders, and the former auto
dealership employee is alleged to have stolen cars from two lots by
posing as a doctor or veterinarian, the Sun reported Friday.
   ``He is a possible suspect. Where he fits in on the hierarchy of
suspects, I don't know,'' said Darnell.
   Investigators were sent to Bartow, where the Polk County
Sheriff's Department was holding a man arrested for burglary who
discussed the killings after turning himself in to police. But
spokeswoman Lynn Breidenbach said he could have learned the
information from news reports.
   In Brevard County, also in central Florida, police questioned an
18-year-old, first-year University of Florida student arrested
Thursday on charges of battering his grandmother.
   Authorities, meanwhile, were struggling to contend with an
active rumor mill in this city about the ``lust killer'' _ who
according to the one report stole body parts of some victims.
   University of Florida President John Lombardi said the school
was operating normally and would not be ``held hostage to lunacy.''
But flags on campus flew at half-staff and the city was being
combed by an army of local police, state investigators and FBI
agents.
   ``We're trying to put a security blanket over this city,'' said
Police Chief Wayland Clifton.
   Despite efforts by police and school officials to provide a safe
and sane environment in the opening week of classes, the discovery
of the murdered students on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday released a
virus of fear.
   The fear was fed by published reports that the killer stole
flesh from some of the mutilated victims and left the head of a
decapitated victim sitting on a shelf.
   Police have given few details about the mutilations. But the St.
Petersburg Times reported that pieces of flesh from the first three
victims were missing. The Orlando Sentinel reported that the
nipples of the first two victims had been removed and had not been
found.
   Clifton said it was the work of a ``lust killer.''
   Fear affected at least one school assignment. Anne G. Jones, an
English professor, said a class chose to put off reading ``Paris
Trout,'' a novel by Pete Dexter about a psychotic murderer stalking
a small town.
   ``They decided they didn't want to be reading this novel in the
middle of the night,'' she said.
   The rumor mill generated endless false leads and terrifying new
possibilities that hindered the investigation.
   ``I've never seen it this bad. It's out of control,'' said Mann.
   A 24-hour rumor-control hot line at the Alachua County Crisis
Center had racked up more than 4,000 calls since Monday's initial
fright.
   ``They're in full panic,'' said a female counselor, a UF
graduate student who did not want her name used. ``The kids are
claiming that they're not getting enough information from the
authorities.''
   The most persistent rumors involved the discovery of more
mutilated bodies _ but there also were reports of satanism, stolen
police uniforms and phony delivery men. Police categorically denied
the stories.
   Wednesday's discovery of two bodies in Melrose, a small town 20
miles to the northeast of Gainesville, set off a brief panic until
police said the slayings were not related to the student killings.
   Many students left town early for the Labor Day weekend, but
Lombardi asserted that things were returning to normal. School
officials said the frightened departure of some hundreds of
students had little impact on the student body of 34,000.
   Other state universities said they were getting inquiries about
transfers.
   Students attended a memorial service Thursday at the St.
Augustine Catholic Center, while individual services were planned
in the dead students' hometowns.
   More than 1,000 friends and family members attended a memorial
service for one of the victims, Sonja Larson.
   ``Was it just last week that we sat and talked about the
future?'' said the Rev. Ken Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church
in Pompano Beach, where Sonja and her family went to church for
years.
   Sonja's boyfriend, Mic Ocasio, 18, of Margate, wept throughout
the half-hour service, as did hundreds of other friends from Ely
High School and the University of Florida.
   Funeral services were scheduled Friday for Ms. Larson's roommate
Christina Powell, 17, in Jacksonville, for Christa Hoyt, 18, in
Newberry and for Tracy Paules, 23, in Coral Gables. A service for
23-year-old Manuel Taboada, the only male victim, was set for
Friday in Miami.
   Police have said the killer appears to be methodical and chooses
his victims carefully, focusing on petite brunettes with
shoulder-length hair.
   Police have said three of the victims died from multiple stab
wounds and that their bodies were mutilated. Autopsies have not
been completed on the bodies of two students found Tuesday,
sheriff's spokesman Mann said.

   Alex Haley says he may not have become a writer
if his parents and grandparents had not given him a foot-thick
slice from a California redwood as a gift 60 years ago.
   The tree slice had small white markers illustrating the tree's
growth, Haley says in the Sept. 2 issue of Parade magazine.
   ``I was told that, if I read all I could, whenever I found
something notably historic, then that could become another marker
in my slice of tree,'' he said.
   ``From then on, I read every book I could handle, along with my
grandpa's newspapers for black people,'' he said. ``Today, I
absolutely believe that the reading inspired by the tree slice
greatly influenced my becoming an author. It is also why I like
most of all to write about historical subjects.''

   Folk singer Richie Havens, who
founded an environmental group on the East Coast earlier this year,
has opened a chapter in Southern California.
   Havens, 49, planted tree seeds Wednesday at the Angeles National
Forest, 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, to inaugurate the
Southern California branch of Natural Guard.
   ``You give kids something to do, and there is no gang ... no
street-corner drugs,'' said Havens, perhaps best known for his
performance of ``Freedom'' at the 1969 Woodstock music festival.
   Havens started the Natural Guard to augment his Northwind
Undersea Institute, an organization that offers marine education
and environmental programs to 30,000 New York schoolchildren.
   He has already begun Natural Guard chapters in New Haven, Conn.,
and Baltimore, and another chapter is expected to open soon in

   An obsessed fan pleaded guilty to sending
more than 200 threatening letters to actress Stephanie Zimbalist.
   In a plea bargain deal calling for a sentence of no more than
one year in prison, Michael Shields, 42, of Plymouth, Mich.,
pleaded guilty Thursday to seven counts of mailing threatening
communications. Sentencing is Oct. 22.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Davies also will place Shields on
five years' probation, order psychiatric care and tell him to stay
at least 500 feet away from the actress.
   Miss Zimbalist, 34, the star of the old ``Remington Steele'' TV
series, could not be reached for comment.
   Prosecutors said Shields received letters to Miss Zimbalist from
August 1988 until Shields' arrest in March. Most of them were short
missives signed ``Your Secret Admirer.''

   ``Not being American, I really had to broaden my horizons,''
Ward says in the Sept. 2 issue of Parade magazine. ``It's not just
a matter of accents _ it's the whole culture.
   ``Most of the female roles here are squeezed between the
hardware and the special effects,'' she said.
   ``But in the past seven years, I've done quite a selection of
roles, and now I'm getting a lot of scripts out of America, more
varied scripts. So I guess it's a matter of chipping away at the
block of misconception.''
   Ward has appeared in such films as ``Against All Odds,'' ``The
Good Wife'' and ``Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,'' and co-stars with
Bruce Dern in the recently released ``After Dark, My Sweet.''

   Glenn Ford plays an aging policeman not
unlike himself in ``Raw Nerve,'' a murder mystery being filmed in
coastal Alabama.
   The character, Captain Gavin, is ``just as much like me as
possible, I guess. I can't play roles which require me to be
someone other than myself,'' the 74-year-old Canadian-born actor
said Wednesday.
   Ford said it takes ``real nerve'' for him to appear before the
camera. ``I never wanted to be an actor,'' he said. ``I just got
lucky.''
   ``Raw Nerve'' is expected to be released in about a year. It
also stars Sandhal Bergman, Randall ``Tex'' Cobb, Ted Prior, Traci
Lords and Jan Michael-Vincent.

   People who take their pills, even if they are
sugar pills, are more likely to live than those who don't follow
the doctor's orders, according to a study in a British medical
journal.
   Dr. Ralph Horwitz of the Yale University School of Medicine,
author of the Lancet study published Thursday, said researchers
cannot explain why people who take their medicine, even placebos,
are more likely to live.
   ``We need a better measure of the social and psychological
features to explain why it is,'' he said.
   Horwitz said his team of researchers analyzed a 1978 test on
Beta Blockers, often given after a heart attack to reduce the
likelihood of further damage.
   Half of the study's participants were given the drug and the
other half were given placebos.
   Horwitz's analysis of the study found that those who took their
medicine _ placebo or drug _ had a higher survival rate than those
who did not.

   Portugal has committed a naval supply
ship and two civilian support vessels to the international armada
in the Middle East.
   The ships will be the first Portuguese contribution to the
multinational force opposing Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Defense Minister Fernando Nogueira announced the decision
Thursday after meeting with military officials. He said naval
supply ship, Sao Miguel, will help enforce the United Nations
embargo on trade with Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   The two civilian ships are ready sail in answer to a U.S.
request for support vessels to back warships in the Persian Gulf,
Nogueira said.
   Portugal is also sending a frigate to participate in NATO
exercises in the Mediterranean Sea beginning Sept. 10, the minister
said.
   The exercises are not directly linked to the imposition of
sanctions against Iraq, Nogueira added.

   The lower house of Parliament has
approved a bill to loosen government control of television and
radio, which can reach all of the country's 880 million people.
   The bill was passed unanimously Thursday by the Lok Sabha, the
lower house of Parliament, Press Trust of India reported. Approval
is also needed by the Rajya Sabha, the upper house, and President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman before it becomes law.
   The bill proposes that control of the air waves switch from the
government's Information and Broadcasting Ministry to a 15-member
board that will include some government representatives.
   A 22-member parliamentary committee, drawn from both governing
and opposition party members, will be empowered to monitor the
running of the television and radio networks.
   Because about two-thirds of the people are illiterate, radio and
television are extremely powerful media. The government has often
been accused of using the broadcast media for propaganda.

<TEXT>
   In American eyes, the United Nations has come
a long way since those days a generation ago when signs sprouted
along the nation's highways carrying a succinct message: ``The U.S.
Out of the U.N. and the U.N. Out of the U.S.''
   That was a time when the U.N. was a target of widespread
ridicule, seemingly incapable of doing much to keep the peace. The
image of the grim-faced Soviet envoy casting veto after veto was a
topic of many a political cartoon.
   But the ability of Washington and Moscow to get along has
breathed new life into the long-beleaguered world body, which is
coming off one of the best months of its 45-year history.
   Without much fanfare, the Security Council this week laid the
groundwork for an end to the 11-year-old civil war in Cambodia.
Such agreement had been impossible beforehand because three of the
five Security Council members _ the United States, the Soviet Union
and China _ had been backing different factions in that conflict.
   Even more impressive have been the council's labors on the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The lengthening bread lines in Baghdad these days are partly the
result of the mandatory worldwide economic embargo the Security
Council approved for Iraq.
   When it comes to regional conflicts, unanimity has been as rare
in the council as an August snow in the Saudi Arabian desert. But
since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the council has virtually
been working in lockstep, approving even the use of military power
to enforce its economic embargo.
   It helps, of course, for the U.N. to have the luxury of
confronting a situation in which there is almost no ambiguity.
Normally, when one country interferes in the internal affairs of
another, it does so quietly, through support for subversive groups
or other covert means.
   But Iraq's Saddam Hussein is not a man given to subtlety. He had
a gripe with Kuwait and, after overrunning the place with 100,000
troops, he annexed it. If he was counting on a limp U.N. response,
he guessed wrong.
   If he had tried to work his will on Kuwait a few years ago, when
the Cold War was still simmering, the United Nations might have
responded with its customary indecisiveness. But with Moscow and
Washington getting along better, it is much easier for the U.N. to
stand up to Saddam.
   ``Many of the Cold War obstacles have dissipated and permitted
the council to function as it was supposed to,'' says John Bolton,
who heads the State Department office responsible for United
Nations affairs.
   One measure of the changed attitude of the Soviet Union is that,
since the accession of President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Kremlin has
not cast a single veto in the Security Council.
   Before that, the Soviets had vetoed 114 resolutions since the
U.N.'s founding in 1945. The United States used its veto power 69
times during that period.
   Americans came to see the U.N. as a rat hole through which
billions were squandered each year, much of it compliments of the
American taxpayer. The U.N. couldn't seem to take a stand against
terrorism. When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the General
Assembly couldn't bring itself to denounce the Soviets by name. The
assembly was considered little more than a forum for Third World
demagoguery.
   While bloody police states escaped censure, Israel was treated
as a pariah state. In the view of many Americans, the U.N. reached
a low point 15 years ago when the assembly equated Zionism with
racism.
   It was just three years ago that columnist Charles Krauthammer
wrote: ``The U.N. is more than just a failed instrument. It is a
bad instrument. We have the power to see it shelved. We should use
that power.''
   Not many would agree with that sentiment nowadays, except
perhaps Saddam Hussein.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Up, Travel Expected Down for Labor Day Weekend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Day weekend travelers will be taking the summer's last
fling on the most expensive fuel in years, and travel experts say a
few may just decide to stay home.
   The estimated 25.5 million who do travel could find other
obstacles. A nationwide traffic reporting service issued a list of
highways that motorists might want to avoid, and several states
planned to use random checkpoints to nab drunken drivers.
   The American Automobile Association expects a 2 percent decline
in air, train, bus and car travel from last year _ partly due to
rising gasoline prices following Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait and partly due to an economic downturn that predates the
Middle East crisis.
   AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla., says Americans are expected to
travel 100 million miles by all modes of transportation during the
three-day weekend, during which more people are traditionally
killed on highways than any other holiday period.
   Safety groups are hoping that energy and cost concerns will slow
down drivers and decrease traffic enough to bring a death toll
lower than last year's 560, which was a decline from the previous
three-year average of 600.
   AAA's survey of gas prices Thursday showed a plentiful supply of
gas, with unleaded regular averaging $1.30 a gallon.
   The Lundberg Survey, which says it checks more stations than
AAA, put the average for regular unleaded at $1.21 a gallon and the
average for all grades of automotive fuel at $1.30 in its latest
survey Aug. 24.
   Trilby Lundberg of Los Angeles, whose family business has been
charting gas prices since the 1950s, said the increases so far are
remarkably similar to those that occurred after the Exxon Valdez
oil spill last year.
   ``And yet, total U.S. consumption slightly exceeded that of
1988,'' she said. ``It's clear that the amount of increase is not
necessarily enough to greatly alter our consumption patterns.''
   Neither AAA nor Lundberg was projecting pump prices for the
weekend, but both indicate that motorists are paying from $2 to $4
more to fill up an average car's tank.
   That should not be enough to affect long-planned trips, said AAA
spokesman Jerry Cheske, but he said some people who travel on
impulse may have second thoughts.
   Air travel is not expected to be significantly affected by the
increase in jet fuel prices, because most travelers purchased
tickets before the Kuwait invasion, said Philip Davidoff,
president-elect of the American Society of Travel Agents.
   Airlines have announced some fare increases, but many rolled
them back to keep planes filled, and bargain fares have been
available on advance fares up to early December.
   ``We might see a greater impact on Christmas travel,'' said
Davidoff, who runs a travel agency in Bowie, Md.
   The Trump and Pan Am shuttles that fly between some Eastern
cities have discount fares available for the weekend, because they
won't be carrying the usual business passengers.
   But by far the most travel would be by private car, with 23.5
people traveling on highways 100 miles or more from home, said AAA.
The figure was based on past data and a telephone survey of 1,500
Americans. An additional 2 million will ride buses, trains or
planes, AAA said.
   For motorists, higher gas prices won't be the only obstacle.
   Metro Traffic Control, a national traffic reporting service
based in Houston, Texas, listed 48 areas in 23 states were highway
construction or heavy congestion were expected to tie up holiday
traffic. It was the first time the service had issued a list of
road problems.
   Among the worst, according to spokesman Jim O'Neill, were the
detour around earthquake-damaged Interstate 880 in Oakland, Calif.;
I-10 between Lafayette and Baton Rouge, La.; U.S. 50 leading to
Maryland beaches; stretches of Interstate 75 in North Monroe
County, Mich.; I-80 at Parsippany, N.J., and in Clearfield and
Jefferson counties, Pa.; I-5 from Vancouver, Wash., into Portland,
Ore., and all routes into Virginia Beach, Va., which police planned
to close off due to violence sparked by college fraternity revelry
last year.
   Drunken drivers also are getting special attention.
   Police in 27 states were setting up sobriety checkpoints under a
Supreme Court ruling that allows police to make random checks for
drunken drivers, according to the American Alliance for Rights and
Responsibilities, which surveyed state public safety officials.
Most other states planned to step up enforcement for the weekend,
the group said.
   President Bush also declared it National Drive For Life Weekend
to push efforts against drunken driving, which figures in about
half of all traffic fatalities.

<HEAD>District Focuses on Picking a New Leader Now That Barry Trial Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the nation's capital finally are
focusing attention on who will be their city's next leader after
spending months preoccupied with the drug and perjury trial of
outgoing Mayor Marion Barry.
   While Barry's trial dominated the news, the mayor's would-be
successors did little or no campaigning, saving their efforts for a
time when they would have the voters' full attention.
   Five Democrats and one Republican are running for mayor, with
the winner of the Sept. 11 Democratic primary considered the
prohibitive favorite in a city where Democrats outnumber
Republicans by almost a 9-1 margin.
   ``Until last week, the press wasn't paying any attention to this
campaign,'' said City Council Chairman David Clarke, who is one of
the Democratic contenders. ``Finally, we can get the issues out
before the voters.''
   The campaign was forced offstage until Aug. 10, when Barry was
convicted of one misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and
acquitted of another. U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has not said
whether he will retry Barry on 12 other perjury, conspiracy and
cocaine possession charges on which the jury reached no decision.
   ``There was some distraction because of the trial, no
question,'' said candidate Sharon Pratt-Dixon. ``Now they are
paying attention to the candidates and the issues. I feel like I'm
getting my point across now.''
   Barry announced as his trial began in June that he would not
seek a fourth four-year term as mayor, saying ``now is the time for
healing, for me personally and for you politically.'' He maintained
he was unfairly singled out for prosecution, partly because he is
black.
   Barry filed petitions this week to run as an independent
candidate for an at-large seat on the city council, where he served
for four years before being elected mayor in 1978. Barry faces a
maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine on the
misdemeanor cocaine possession conviction.
   The mayor, whose trial featured videotaped evidence that showed
him smoking crack cocaine during an FBI sting operation, made
frequent appearances at school anti-drug rallies as part of his
mayoral schedule.
   Some of the next mayor's biggest challenges will be problems
linked to the district's flourishing drug trade. More than 400
people were murdered in 1989 and another 200 in the first half of
1990 _ more than half of the deaths blamed on drugs.
   The city's infant mortality rate was more than double the
national average in 1988, a problem city officials attributed in
part to drug abuse among women of childbearing age.
   The candidates also are calling for repairs to the city's
deteriorating public housing units, shrinking the district's
bureaucracy and improving its much-maligned public school system.
   As the primary campaign entered the final stretch, council
member John Ray was increasing the advantage he had over his
opponents when the mayor's case went to court in June.
   Ray's rivals criticize him for his close ties to developers, his
efforts to do away with rent control and for omitting mention of
his first wife _ a white woman _ from his official biography.
   Ray, who is black, had the support of 33 percent of registered
Democrats surveyed for a Washington Post poll released this week.
Council member Charlene Drew-Jarvis was second at 17 percent,
followed by Dixon and Walter Fauntroy, the district's non-voting
delegate to Congress, with 10 percent and Clarke with 9 percent.
The survey had a 3 percentage point margin of error.
   Two in 10 voters interviewed were undecided, 48 percent of those
who expressed a preference said they were not solidly behind that
candidate, and 48 percent said it was fairly important that Barry's
successor be black.
   Seventy percent of the district's residents are black. Clarke is
the only white candidate in the mayoral race.
   The only Republican in the race is former D.C. police chief
Maurice T. Turner, who announced he was leaving the Democratic
Party in a highly publicized meeting with President Bush last year.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Rat Tests for Low-Level Chemical Exposures Useless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When rats are stuffed with the maximum
non-lethal dose of a chemical and then develop cancer, it may be
the dose and not the chemical that causes the disease, researchers
say in reports published today.
   Bruce N. Ames, professor of cell biology at the University of
California, Berkeley, said government-supported cancer tests on
rats are ``useless'' because they depend upon the concept that high
doses fed to rats over the short rodent lifetime produce the same
results as very low exposures over a long period of time in humans.
   Ames said cancer may develop in test rats through a process of
``chronic wounding'' caused by the dose and not as a direct effect
of the chemical.
   Animal cancer tests, said Ames, are conducted at the maximum
tolerated doses which kill cells and cause nearby cells to divide
to replace the loss.
   Each time replacement cells are grown, said Ames, there is a
risk of a cancer mutation. The more cells that are replaced over a
lifetime, the higher the odds of a cell mutating into cancer. Thus,
he said, the cancer may be caused by the dose, not by the chemical
action itself.
   ``Government dependence on animal testing for carcinogens is
pretty much useless for protecting us against low levels of
chemicals,'' Ames said in an interview. ``When you test chemicals
on rats at very high doses, the maximum tolerated doses, half of
them will come out positive (develop cancer), but the reason is
that it is killing cells.''
   Such tests, he said, are ``chronic wounding experiments and
chronic wounding is a risk factor for cancer.''
   Ames said that people are unreasonably afraid of synthetic
chemicals, but that humans eat many natural cancer-causing
chemicals in their everyday diet.
   He said 77 chemicals that occur naturally in foods have been
tested on rats at maximum tolerated doses and 37 have been found to
be carcinogens. Ames said about the same proportion of carcinogens
have been found in synthetic chemicals tested _ 212 out of 350.
   A simple cup of coffee, said Ames, has 826 volatile chemicals.
Scientists have tested 21 of these chemicals using high doses and
found that 16 are rodent carcinogens, he said.
   ``You get more carcinogens in a cup of coffee than in all of the
(synthetic) pesticide residues you absorb in a year,'' said Ames.
   The scientists said there is a public fear about minute
quantities in the diet of man-made pesticide residues, but he
noted, ``99.9 percent of all pesticides we eat are natural.'' he
said. And 27 out of 52 tested pesticides that occur naturally in
plants have been found to be rodent carcinogens.
   In another paper in Science, Samuel M. Cohen of the University
of Nebraska College of Medicine said that in studies on mice he and
his collaborators demonstrated that there can be both a dose and a
chemical effect in developing cancer.
   For some chemicals, said Cohen, cancer developed in laboratory
animals only at very high levels, while other chemicals at very low
doses can trigger mutations that can lead to cancer.
   Cohen said, however, that federal law requires all chemicals
that cause cancer in test animals, no matter what the dose, to be
regulated.
   ``A large proportion of the compounds, perhaps 50 percent,
listed in the National Toxicology Program (which evaluates
chemicals), cause cancer only at high doses,'' he said.
   Cohen said the government now classifies chemicals as
cancer-causing or noncancer-causing. He said there needs to be a
third category for those compounds that cause cancer only at very
high doses.
   Ames said many people demand regulation of synthetic chemicals
that may be in the environment at only one part per billion. This,
he said, is not realistic.
   ``One part per billion is one person in all of China,'' he said.
``It's one drop of vermouth in five tank cars of gin.
   ``People should stop spending all the time and money on such
trivial levels and start getting after the important cancer
risks,'' such as smoking, preventable infections and high fat
diets, said Ames.
   Sydney Green, director of toxicological studies for the Food and
Drug Administration, said the views expressed by Ames and Cohen
about the value of animal cancer tests are not universally
accepted. But he admitted that some government scientists are
starting to question past scientific assumptions on cancer tests.
   Cancers may be caused by dose alone in some cases, said Green,
``but that's uncertain at this point and ... you cannot extrapolate
some findings to all substances.''
   Dr. Bernard D. Goldstein, chairman of the department of
environmental medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry
of New Jersey, said he is convening a panel at the National Academy
of Science to examine the use of animal tests in determining human
cancer risk.
   ``The issues are open to scientific debate,'' he said. ``There
is a fair amount of interest developing in the issue of maximum
tolerate dose'' in evaluating the risk of cancer.
   Science, which published papers by Ames and Cohen, is the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<TEXT>
   In this kingdom's oldest inhabited
oasis, the Middle East crisis that brought the American armed
forces to Saudi Arabia seems far away and the future is placed in
``God's hands.''
   Khalid Al-Lataibi shook his head after the weekly camel auction
at the oasis, 100 miles south of the oil capital of Dhahran.
   ``The market was tired,'' he said. Few of the meat camels for
sale reached the top price of $400.
   He did not attribute the low prices to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait and the subsequent war tension on his country's northern
border.
   ``It's the heat,'' said the 27-year-old electrician with the
ARAMCO oil giant who tends camels in his native village on
weekends. August temperatures soar to 120 degrees.
   But war was on everybody's mind, Al-Lataibi conceded.
   ``It's all the people talk about. First let's talk about peace,
then if there's no peace, we can talk about war,'' he said.
   As he spoke, young camels yowled in the background.
   But the sellers seemed more intent on discussing the merits of a
$13,000 racing camel than the conflict.
   The government has recently encouraged the breeding of racing
camels by supporting prizes of up to $26,000 and four-wheel drive
vehicles. The racing season starts in October.
   A 10-year-old boy said he now had four camels. His father had
given him one to start trading with. He said his ambition was to
make money and ``be a pilot.''
   The skies over Houfuf were free of the huge C-5 Galaxy
transports and F-15 jet fighters that roared over Dhahran, capital
of Saudi Arabia's oil-rich Eastern Province and operations center
for the airlift of U.S. men and equipment.
   The mud brick past of the town is long-buried. Its main street
is a strip of carpet stores, auto dealers and fast food
restaurants. Favorite cars include General Motors Suburbans and
Chevrolet Silverados.
   People downtown said there was a run on food in the first days
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's troops overran Kuwait and
massed along the emirate's border with Saudi Arabia.
   ``They were afraid, but now with the American army any rocket or
any plane Saddam sent could be destroyed,'' said an 18-year-old,
who gave only his first name, Ibrahim.
   People still plan for escaping any fighting, but the mood is
calmer now, said shopkeeper Abdullah, 22.
   ``I have my passport. I have my money, but I'm here. We're safer
here,'' he said.
   Escape plans include flight across hundreds of miles of desert
to Mecca and Medina, the holiest cities in Islam.
   But in the palm groves of the surrounding villages the people
are not worried about war.
   ``If there's fighting it would be in Khafji and that's far
away,'' said Haji Fahd Mubarak, selling watermelons at one roadside
stand. Khafji lies 240 miles to the north, on the border with
Kuwait.
   The fruit sellers, like the camel farmers, said the sitaution
was out of their control.
   ``I'm not worried,'' said camel farmer Bakhit Salah, 36. ``I
leave it in God's hands.''

   Fraternity brothers and other male
students in this college town say they've assumed a special
responsibility following five killings, but sometimes bravado masks
fear.
   ``A lot of the guys are feeling the John Wayne macho man kind of
thing,'' said Todd Silberman, 20, a junior at the University of
Florida who volunteered for the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol
to escort women students at night.
   ``My fraternity ... we volunteered to help out with SNAP, but,
you know, we're scared ourselves,'' he said. ``Some of our guys are
going home.''
   When the bodies of the first three victims, all women, were
found early this week, many men at the university say they quickly
phoned female friends to offer escorts or other aid.
   Two fraternities offered their entire memberships as volunteers
to SNAP.
   ``Males suddenly were a pillar of strength,'' said Tom Santilli,
president of the university's Inter-Fraternity Council.
   After two more bodies were found, one of them male, fear spread
among men, Santilli said Thursday. But he added, ``I still think
there's a sense that males protect.''
   In the midnight darkness Wednesday, freshman Peter Dodzik kept
as much as possible in the light spilling from a parking garage as
he returned from escorting a friend back to her dormitory.
   ``Even before the panic really started,'' said the 18-year-old
from Fort Wayne, Ind., ``I called all the girls I know, to make
sure they were OK.''
   Joe Cannistra, 21, a senior, said, ``I've been on the phone many
nights talking to my women friends, making sure they're OK. I'd say
there's an extra responsibility to the women.''
   At the SNAP office, calls for escorts have increased from the
usual 40 or so a night to as many as 200. There are about 23
escorts, screened by campus police, said Brett Hodgson, a SNAP
supervisor and a senior.
   What about fear? ``I don't think any of our guys are really that
concerned,'' Hodgson said, crediting that mainly to training that
teaches them how to ``get a sense of trouble before it would
happen.''
   Stacy Tuerpe, who works in the SNAP office, said men on campus
were making an effort.
   ``I know lots of guys that are staying with girls they don't
know that well,'' she said. ``They just live next door _ the girls
just didn't want to stay alone.''
   At a Gainesville rally Wednesday evening to protest violence
against women, one speaker, Sallie Ann Harrison, criticized the
creators of horror films. ``They know what they're doing. They're
reinforcing male rage,'' she said.
   Authorities on serial killers have said the Gainesville killer
is almost certainly a man, probably a loner in his 20s or 30s.
   Santilli said some of the male students' actions may be attempts
to negate the view that the killer was doing ``a male thing.
   ``I don't think there's that many people like that,'' he said.
``He was just a sick person.''

   The Persian Gulf crisis has placed major
strains on Yemen's new unity, underscoring the deep ideological
divide between its once-rival states and jeopardizing relations
with neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   Iraq, which has close ties to Yemen, invaded Kuwait only three
months after the May 22 merger of conservative North Yemen and
Marxist South Yemen. The merger ended nearly three decades of
rivalry on the southwestern tip of the Arabian peninsula.
   The new nation of 12 million sits astride the Bab el Mandeb
Strait, the southern gateway to the Red Sea. The sea became more
important after the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq spilled into the Persian Gulf.
   Western diplomats say the new Persian Gulf crisis has brought
out smoldering ideological differences inside Yemen. There had been
opposition to the merger from Islamic militants in the north and
diehard Marxists in the south.
   Thousands of Yemenis have mounted demonstrations to support
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Many have reportedly volunteered to
fight for Iraq against the United States and its allies who are
building up forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, president of the new Yemen republic,
has been put on the spot. He is trying to support Iraq while
avoiding a collision with Saudi Arabia, analysts say.
   A Yemeni newspaper editor, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said: ``We're in a difficult situation ... because of our close
ties with Iraq.''
   Saleh, the former president of North Yemen, is one of Saddam's
main allies. He has refused to join Arab moderates in their stand
against Iraq. He has also objected to the thousands of U.S. and
other troops deployed in Saudi Arabia to counter Iraq.
   However, Yemen has also said it will abide by economic sanctions
imposed by the United Nations on Iraq.
   British sources said Yemen could become a staging post for an
air bridge into Iraq to get around the quarantine, but aviation
experts think it unlikely.
   Some Arab diplomats find Saleh's stance inexplicable and even
self-destructive. They contend no Yemeni leader can afford to
offend the Saudis, one of the country's main benefactors.
   But like King Hussein of Jordan, another Saddam ally, Saleh
faces serious damage to his shaky economy if trade ties with Iraq
are severed.
   ``If Iraq comes out victorious in this crisis, Yemen will look
good. If Iraq loses, Yemen will be in a difficult position in all
respects _ politically, militarily and economically,'' said one
Arab diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The invasion of Kuwait was an economic blow in itself to Yemen.
Kuwait, like Saudi Arabia, provided financial aid and crude oil to
Yemen's oil refinery at Aden. Iraq has an agreement to provide
30,000 barrels a day.
   Oil industry sources, indicating that Yemen is abiding by the
embargo, reported that oil is now being pumped from the north to
Aden to make up for the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies.
   British Royal Air Force sources have reported that some Iraqi
combat jets have been flown to Yemen for use if Iraqi air bases are
hit. Saleh has denied that.
   Yemen emerged as a potential flashpoint when U.S. warships began
shadowing Iraqi oil tankers to Aden, enforcing the U.N.-sanctioned
trade embargo against Iraq.
   Yemen's Information Minister Mohammed Ahmed Garhoum denied
British allegations that Yemen violated the U.N. sanctions by
allowing an Iraqi tanker, the Ain Zalah, to unload at Aden.
   He said in a telephone interview that the tanker partially
unloaded before the sanctions, but unloading stopped after the
embargo resolution.
   Yemen last week ordered the expulsion of Britain's
consul-general in Aden, Douglas Gordon, after he was arrested
photographing shipping at Aden. But the Yemenis relented after
strong British protests.
   Garhoum insisted: ``It's not true that Yemen supports Iraq. ...
Yemen wants Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait.
   ``Our position is clear. Our government underlines the necessity
of respect for national sovereignty, and we reject the use of
force. It's only a summer cloud that will soon go away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Budget Problems May Erode Soil And Water Conservation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Congress and the White House don't solve
the government's budget problems, soil and water conservation
programs will suffer along with other Agriculture Department
services.
   An analysis by the department's budget office says a
``sequester'' plan to cut federal spending would result in unpaid
furloughs for thousands of Soil Conservation Service employees.
   Overall, about 90 percent of the department's 100,000 fulltime
employees would be affected one way or another by the layoffs and
other savings measures.
   The White House, citing the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law,
has ordered the across-the-board cut of federal spending to begin
in October if no budget agreement is reached.
   By law, the Soil Conservation Service is responsible for
defining highly erodible land and wetlands, and for helping farmers
develop and install conservation plans in order to continue
qualifying for USDA program benefits.
   The agency said planning of the necessary projects has been
completed but that only about 30 percent of the necessary measures
have been installed.
   Under the law, farmers have until Dec. 31, 1994, to install
approved conservation systems. Swampbuster provisions require the
Soil Conservation Service to have wetland determinations completed
by Dec. 31, 1991, and an inventory of wetlands ready by the end of
1992.
   Besides these mandated timetables, the conservation service also
must provide technical assistance for the vast Conservation Reserve
Program, which now has about 34 million acres under 10-year
contracts.
   The program provides financial assistance to convert highly
erodible cropland into protective grass or trees. It also provides
annual rental payments over the 10-year contract, averaging almost
$50 per year per acre.
   A sequester of 31.9 percent in the USDA spending for the fiscal
year that will begin Oct. 1 would cut about $7.3 billion from
programs that otherwise would cost $22.9 billion in 1990-91.
   Food stamps, school lunches and other entitlement programs
costing around $23 billion next year would mostly be exempt from
the cuts.
   Under a 31.9 percent sequester used in the analysis _ and
officials say it could go higher _ the conservation money still
available for 1990-91 would be used mainly to help meet the
deadlines ordered by law.
   That would be done ``at the expense of other conservation
operations such as the water quality initiative, soil mapping and
other operations, the USDA report said.
   ``Continued assistance to the nearly 3,000 conservation
districts would also be jeopardized, and it would be necessary to
reduce services at most SCS field offices,'' it said. ``Even with
the best efforts to meet the higher priority needs, it is unlikely
that many of the ... conservation targets could be met.''
   The Conservation Reserve Program last year was determined to be
subject to a federal cutback, and if this is upheld for 1990-91 it
could mean reductions in the payments farmers get for program land
under contract, the report said.
   Reneging on such monetary incentives would be harmful to the
cause of conservation and environmental improvement, said Kenneth
Cook of the Washington-based Center for Resource Economics.
   ``Conservation, along with research, seem to be always the first
things to go, while the entitlements are protected above all
else,'' Cook said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   At the start of this year, he said, everyone, including the
administration and Congress, was saying that incentives were needed
to deal with water quality and pollution problems.

   The Agriculture Department has notified the
nation's 6,300 meat and poultry plants that budget cuts will force
the withdrawal of federal inspection services this fall.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Thursday layoffs of inspection
personnel will effectively close the plants during those periods.
   The layoffs, or furloughs, would begin Oct. 1 under an initial
sequester order by President Bush, he said. A final determination
would be made by Oct. 15 if Congress and the White House fail to
reach a budget agreement.
   Crawford said the initial furloughs would be for a maximum of 36
hours during the Oct. 1-14 period.

   Westerners caught in Kuwait survive day
by day in a harrowing hide-and-seek game with Iraqis intent on
finding yet more hostages for their human shield, say some escapees
at this border post.
   ``Spirits are good, but people are trapped in their homes,
hiding out and hoping for the best,'' said Ayman Aziz, a Greek
engineer who also has an Arab nationality he would not specify.
   He slipped out of Kuwait on Tuesday but waved off questions on
how he did it. ``Let's just say there is more than one way to
falsify papers,'' he said Thursday at Ruweishid, 210 miles
northeast of Amman.
   Each day, troops tighten the circle, he said, with roadblocks
every few streets. ``They are starting to seal off neighborhoods
and search house-to-house in the city,'' he said.
   About 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans, were in
Kuwait when Iraq invaded on Aug. 2. An unknown number escaped,
mostly into Saudi Arabia. But some others were taken to Baghdad.
   Iraqi agents rounded up 32 more Britons, the Foreign Office said
Thursday in London, bringing to 197 the total of British subjects
detained in Kuwait. Also, authorities seized the passports of six
Italians at a hotel.
   Many Western families live in the suburbs, where they elude
capture by staying behind drawn curtains, living in the dark at
night, and husbanding their dwindling reserves of food.
   ``They can't go outside, they can't communicate with their
embassies,'' said Aziz, the engineer. ``All they can do is listen
to BBC every hour. They are waiting for the Marines to rescue them,
but they are afraid of what might happen if the Marines try.''
   In Kuwait City itself, the game is grimmer. Iraqis are beginning
to examine bank records to find foreigners' home addresses, other
refugees said.
   ``I stayed in hiding like a rat eating nothing but rice and
lentils,'' said J.M. Sharma, a 55-year-old American agricultural
scientist of Indian origin. He flew to Amman from Baghdad on
Thursday using an Indian travel document.
   Sharma said he moved to an Asian working class neighborbood to
escape detection. He and some friends hid food in air ducts to be
sure of a future supply.
   He said he was saddened he could not have take an American
colleague with him.
   ``A white American is different from a brown American,'' he
said. ``I could pass. This (man) was as white as they come. If I
had some way of making his skin dark, I would have brought him.
Otherwise, they would have spotted him right away.''
   Only a few Westerners in Kuwait have heeded Iraqi instructions
to report to hotels. Some are in hotels under strict controls.
   Aziz was one of the few Westerners among the 250,000 refugees
who have streamed through Ruweishid.
   Egyptians, Bangladeshis and other Asians are being processed at
a steady rate of about 20,000 a day. About 25,000 more sprawl
listlessly in makeshift tent cities, awaiting their turn.
   The scene ranges from abject misery to good humor.
   On Thursday, children jumped up and down with excitement,
laughing and pointing, when Jordanian fighters streaked overhead on
a surveillance mission.
   Among the sea of abjectly poor refugees, three little girls
looked in dazed confusion from the rear window of a cinnamon Rolls
Royce. It was in mint condition, except a smashed ``RR'' hood
ornament.
   Nearly everyone has left behind all family holdings in Kuwait.
Workers fled without their meager savings or their last paychecks.
Other refugees abandoned property worth millions.
   But the Western refugees said people left behind would be happy
to trade their fortunes for freedom.
   ``The biggest worry is that they might cut off the water and
electricity,'' Sharma, the agricultural scientist, said in Amman.
If the multinational force poised in Saudi Arabia attacks Kuwait to
oust Iraq, he said, utilities would go first.
   ``That's the first thing he (Saddam Hussein) will do,'' Sharma.
``He has put dynamite around the plants, and he'll dynamite the
whole shebang.''
   But Aziz said power and water supplies were normal, and people
could use their air conditioning. Most families still had food
stocked in freezers, he said.
   ``But they're out of booze,'' he added. ``If you have a beer,
I'd be grateful.''

   The thousands of Americans held in Iraq
constitute the largest group of U.S. hostages since plane
hijackings and kidnappings became widespread instruments of
political persuasion in the Middle East.
   However, they're in a new kind of bind. Unlike the blindfolded
hostages held in closets or at gunpoint in Lebanon and Iran in
recent years, the Americans in Iraq have generally received
acceptable physical treatment, according to reports reaching the
West.
   In addition, they are being held by the Iraqi government _ not
factions with links to a national leadership _ and used to deter
any air attack on the country.
   Beyond that, little is known of the Americans trapped in Iraq
and occupied Kuwait. In the first days after the Aug. 2 invasion,
it was estimated there were 3,000 Americans in Kuwait and 500 in
Iraq among the 21,000 Westerners in the two countries.
   But these figures are obsolete because many have fled, most of
them Americans of Arab or Asian extraction. Officials in Washington
say about a third of the Americans in Kuwait before the invasion
were Arab Americans or Asian Americans.
   ``A white American is different from a brown American,'' said
J.M. Sharma, an American agricultural engineer of Indian origin who
flew to Jordan on Thursday.
   After the United States and other nations began sending forces
to the region to counter Iraq, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
announced that foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' would not be
allowed to leave the country. He said they must remain as
``guests'' placed at strategic locations to protect against a
possible attack on Iraq.
   Many Americans were rounded up and taken to Baghdad. Officials
said at least five dozen were known to have been used as ``human
shields.''
   Polish workers returning home from Iraq told a newspaper last
week they saw about 35 Americans arriving under guard at the
Chemadex chemical factory in Al-Qaim, where they worked.
   Other Americans have remained behind, staying inside to avoid
detention, fearful of trying to contact their embassies, and living
off dwindling food supplies, according to refugees reaching Jordan.
   Some of the Americans work for large U.S. firms under contract
to Kuwaiti enterprises, such as oil companies. Some work as
teachers or in small businesses.
   Other Americans, like Elizabeth Linoff, were traveling when Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
   Ms. Linoff, 50, was among 237 Western women and children
gathered Thursday at a hotel in Baghdad awaiting exit visas. Saddam
announced earlier this week he would release foreign women and
children.
   Ms. Linoff said she was working as an English teacher in
Casablanca, Morocco, and was en route from France to Kuala Lumpur
at the time of the invasion when her British Airways flight was
stranded.
   ``I'm happy that it's now all over,'' she told a reporter.
   But it was unclear if it was all over.
   Saddam's announcement Tuesday said the women and children would
be allowed to leave starting Wednesday. Western governments
complained Thursday that an undue amount of paperwork was required
for the exit visas.
   Margaret Tutwiler, a State Department spokesman, said there are
about 500 American women in Kuwait as well as 410 children under
age 18. She indicated the number of women and children in Iraq is
less than 100.
   The Baghdad government said 28 foreign ``guests'' had opted to
stay. Diplomats in the Iraqi capital said they were mostly those
with government contracts or businesses in Iraq.

   When the men of the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment crossed the boundaries of this huge military base, their
teeth became the property and responsibility of the U.S. Army.
   The tiny National Guard water purification unit of 14 men has
been activated for possible duty in Saudi Arabia. The South
Carolina guardsmen face the potential of blazing desert heat and
the uncertainties of geo-politics.
   But first came the picks and pliers of a dentist known lovingly
on base as ``The Prince of Pain.''
   Six men had teeth pulled or cavities filled. At the end of their
first day of mobilization most were muttering and lisping through
Novocain and cotton gauze.
   ``I guess y'all have some pretty bad teeth,'' said the unit's
leader, a sergeant named Ronnie who is a probation officer in
civilian life. Army security rules prohibit publication of the
men's last names.
   ``Huh uhh ahh,'' Ernie, another sergeant, said, opening his
mouth to display the fact the bad teeth were no more.
   Thursday's tooth torture was an ignoble beginning for the 265th,
which received an emotional sendoff Wednesday from Allendale, S.C.
   All the men are from Allendale or the outlying communities of
Brunson and Fairfax, small towns about three hours drive from Fort
Stewart.
   Despite the oppressive heat, more than 1,000 people, nearly 20
percent of Allendale's population, turned out for a red, white and
blue bannered celebration of speeches and church choir songs. Each
man of the unit was presented with a Bible.
   The celebration spilled into the next morning. Students from the
local elementary and high schools lined the road to wave as the
unit left for Fort Stewart with its three 1.5-ton trucks fitted
with equipment that uses filters and chemicals to purify water.
   The callup of the 265th is a source of local pride. South
Carolina has guard units that drive M-1 tanks and fly Apache
helicopters. But only the 265th has been activated, an indication
of the value clean drinking water will have for U.S. troops in the
Mideast.
   ``We know we can get the mission done,'' said William, a
44-year-old construction worker who served a tour of duty in
Vietnam 20 years ago. There is another Vietnam vet in the unit;
nearly half have seen duty in the regular military.
   The men of the 265th represent a cross section of the
civilian-soldiers being called to duty in the Gulf crisis. They
range from Henry, a 51-year-old retired football coach to James, a
20-year-old marketing major at the University of South Carolina.
Some have served in the unit for 18 years.
   ``When I got out of the Army, I wanted to stay part of the
military, so I joined the Guard,'' William said.
   Until now, that meant giving up a weekend every month, two weeks
each summer and occasional special duty, like last year's Hurricane
Hugo.
   But on Sunday they lost their Weekend Warrior status when they
were placed on alert. For at least the next 90 days, the guardsmen
will be regular soldiers assigned to the U.S. 2nd Army.
   Other guard and reserve units from Georgia and Florida have been
sent to Fort Stewart, normally a bustling base of 14,000 where
empty parade grounds and parking lots testify to the deployment of
regular forces to the Persian Gulf.
   But the reservists are mostly ``housekeeping units'' of clerks
and typists needed to keep the giant base going. Only the 265th has
been set for overseas service.
   That prospect was the subject of jokes among the men as they
bounced in the back of a truck on its way from the mess hall back
to the stifling hot barracks they will live in until they go home
or overseas.
   One man wondered aloud how fast and deep you could dig a foxhole
in the sand. The black soldiers kidded about the prospect of
suntans. They speculated about how long it would be before they
will be deployed. ``A week,'' said one. ``Three weeks,'' said
another.
   ``Ninety days sounds good to me,'' said a third.
   William, the Vietnam veteran, said no one was too concerned
about the future.
   ``I don't worry,'' he said. ``I learned that if you follow the
rules and regulations and pay attention to your training, it'll be
all right.''

<HEAD>Democrats And Incumbents Reap Rich PAC Harvest For Fall Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political action committees are donating
record amounts to congressional candidates, favoring Democrats over
Republicans and _ by a wide margin _ incumbents over challengers.
   New Federal Election Commission figures showed Thursday that
candidates running for Congress in the 1989-90 election cycle
collected a record $93.7 million from PACs from Jan. 1, 1989
through last June 30.
   The total compares to $88 million in the first 18 months of the
1987-88 election cycle and is a dramatic increase from the $71
million given to congressional candidates in the 1985-86 cycle.
   Democrats, who control Congress, easily outdistanced
Republicans, receiving more than $59 million from PACs compared to
more than $34 million for GOP candidates.
   Most PAC contributions, $79 million, went to incumbents, while
$6.5 million went to challengers and $8.1 million to those running
for open seats.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the congressional watchdog group
Common Cause, said, ``The extraordinary ratio of incumbents to
challengers just reaffirms that PACs are an incumbent re-election
machine today, and a central part of what is wrong with the current
campaign finance system.
   ``They are playing a major role in making it exceedingly
difficult for challengers to have a chance to run competitive
races, and they are obviously continuing to use their money to try
to influence congressional decisions.''
   Each house of Congress passed legislation to curb spending for
congressional campaigns. However, the versions have major
differences, and it is unclear whether a compromise can be worked
out this year.
   Wertheimer said he favors the two-tiered approach in the Senate
bill: ban PACs altogether, but if that provision is ruled
unconstitutional, severely limit PAC contributions.
   The Senate fall back provision would limit PAC money to 20
percent of a candidate's campaign contributions, and limit a single
PAC's contributions to $1,000 per candidate for each election.
   Current law only limits individual PAC contributions, with
$5,000 allowed per candidate for each election.
   The House bill would impose an aggregate PAC limit of $275,000
for each candidate. The current $5,000 contribution limits would be
retained.
   Most PACs are formed by special interest groups, labor
organizations and corporations.
   In the 18-month FEC figures, corporate PACs led in al categories
of donations, contributing $35 million to federal candidates,
followed by the $26 million contributed by PACs in the combined
category of trade associations, membership organizations and health
groups. Labor PACs were next with $20 million.
   The study also showed that overall PAC spending for federal
candidates increased by 8.3 percent, to $233 million, in the first
18 months of the current cycle. Total PAC receipts rose 3.3 percent
to $275 million.
   More than $66 million of the PAC contributions went to House
candidates, while $27 million went to candidates for the Senate.
   The FEC said the most money collected by a PAC was $8 million,
by the Teamsters-run Democratic Republican Independent Voter
Education Committee. The American Medical Association Political
Action Committee was next, collecting $4.7 million.
   The Teamsters organization also spent the most, $6.4 million,
followed by the AMA's PAC, which spent $3 million.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's PAC led corporate committees,
collecting more than $2 million, followed by the Federal Express
Corp. PAC with just over $1 million. The two PACs also led
corporate disbursements.

<HEAD>Regulator Sees Growing Difficulty in Moving on Ailing S&amp;Ls</HEAD>

   The nation's top S&amp;L regulator says it is
becoming increasingly difficult to decide which troubled thrifts
should be taken over by the government.
   ``The job is going to get much tougher,'' Timothy Ryan, director
of the Office of Thrift Supervision, told a news conference
Thursday.
   The savings and loans seized by the government in the months
following the enactment of legislation a year ago were blatantly
clear cases of failure, Ryan said.
   They ``were like pornography,'' he said. ``You know it when you
see it.''
   Now, however, many troubled S&amp;Ls are in borderline financial
situations and ``much more difficult to identify,'' Ryan added.
   Since the S&amp;L bailout bill became law, the government's
Resolution Trust Corp. has taken over 475 ailing institutions.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has recently taken a new
approach, seeking to sell crippled S&amp;Ls to outside investors while
they are still under private ownership, rather than transferring
them to the Resolution Trust Corp. Once they are taken over by the
government, the institutions become more difficult to sell, Ryan
noted.
   He made the comments as he released an Office of Thrift
Supervision report showing that the financial conditions of more
than 200 savings and loans have worsened since the agency made its
last such report in May.
   At least 246 S&amp;Ls are expected to fail and are likely candidates
for government takeover, the Office of Thrift Supervision said in
its new report.
   ``If current economic conditions continue or get worse, it's
very possible we will see additional deterioration when we report
... again in three months,'' Ryan said.
   He noted that the sharp increase in oil prices caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis had heightened the economic uncertainty. The
thrift industry, already suffering from a slowing economy and real
estate market, could be jolted further by rising oil prices.
   ``Anything that's bad news for the economy is bad news for the
(S&amp;L) cleanup,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va.
   The thrift agency's latest report provides additional evidence
that ``we clearly have a deteriorating condition in these
institutions,'' Ely said.
   The government has estimated the cost of the savings and loan
bailout at about $500 billion, or $2,000 for every U.S. taxpayer
over the next 30 years.
   In its latest quarterly report, the Office of Thrift Supervision
detailed the changes in its classification of the nation's S&amp;Ls
into four categories of financial health.
   There was a ``modest'' shifting of S&amp;Ls from one category to
another based on financial results for the period from Jan. 1
through March 31, the agency said.
   The categories are:
   _Group I, institutions considered by regulators to be profitable
and with sufficient capital (currently 1,175 S&amp;Ls).
   _Group II, S&amp;Ls that meet or are expected to meet capital
requirements (680).
   _Group III, troubled thrifts with poor earnings and low capital
(352).
   _Group IV, institutions expected to fail and be taken over by
the Resolution Trust Corp. (246).
   The report showed a net decline of 89 in the healthiest S&amp;Ls,
those in Group I.
   Nearly all the 106 institutions that left the category got
worse, but 17 institutions from lower ratings improved.
   There was a net decline of 64 in the shakiest thrifts, including
51 that were seized by the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Thirty-four of the shaky S&amp;Ls improved their position and moved
into a healthier category, mainly by getting new infusions of
capital from outside investors, the Office of Thrift Supervision
said.
   Group IV institutions continue to be concentrated in a few
states: Texas had the greatest number with 29, followed by Florida
with 25, California 22, Illinois 18, New Jersey 17, and Ohio and
Louisiana 11 each.
   In addition, thrift assets among the shakiest institutions
continue to be concentrated in a relatively few large institutions,
with 73 percent of the assets held by 41 S&amp;Ls with assets of at
least $1 billion.

<HEAD>`Ghost' No. 1 in a Spooky Summer Movie Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The curtain drops on the summer movie season
this weekend with the spectral romance of ``Ghost'' winning the
most moviegoers' hearts, surpassing such big-budget thrillers as
``Total Recall'' and ``Die Hard 2.''
   Tom Cruise's ``Days of Thunder'' faded early. The much-hyped
``Dick Tracy'' failed to fire up the box office for long.
   Bruce Willis' ``Die Hard 2'' did well, but wasn't tops. And
``RoboCop 2'' quickly ran out of power.
   Not even the industry's most prescient prognosticators picked
``Ghost'' to scare up the most business.
   A modest supernatural thriller starring Demi Moore, Patrick
Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg, ``Ghost'' today should pass Arnold
Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall'' to reach the box-office's top
spot with more than $115 million at the gate, Paramount Pictures
says.
   ``It's so far away from what's out there this summer,'' said
``Ghost's'' maker, producer Howard W. Koch. ``The audience said,
`No more four-letter words. I don't want to see anybody blown up.'
It's about time people can be in love with one another and not feel
embarrassed.''
   Said Bruce Corwin, president of Southern California's
Metropolitan movie theater chain: ``This summer had an abundance of
action-orieneted films and they just fought each other....`Ghost'
was huge, a pleasant surprise to everyone.''
   Koch admitted the Paramount film, budgeted around $20 million,
was an unlikely hit. The audience was attracted by positive word of
mouth and a strong story by writer Bruce Joel Rubin and director
Jerry Zucker.
   Barry London, president of Paramount's Motion Picture Group,
said the film was marketed for a select audience.
   ``We attempted to take advantage of the perceived lack of
programming for women,'' London said. ``We elected to focus on the
romance of the film, rather than the action or comedy.'' He said,
too, that the film's stars tirelessly promoted their work.
   Koch hopes the film's smashing showing will prove to Hollywood
deal makers that $12 million acting contracts _ the going rate for
Schwarzenegger _ don't necessarily guarantee success.
   Indeed, in a season loaded with several overblown sequels and
richly budgeted action films, most performed only moderately well.
   Paramount's ``Days of Thunder,'' for instance, has made $79
million, just a few million more than Cruise's 1988 ``Cocktail.''
The studio's ``Another 48 HRS.,'' with Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte,
grossed $78.7 million.
   Universal's ``Back to the Future Part III'' made $83.6 million,
compared to the $110 million collected by ``Back to the Future Part
II.''
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment industry analyst with Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc., said that such grosses should not be seen as
inadequate.
   ``Anytime you can do movies around $80 million or more, by
`Batman' standards that's not considered successful, but by
industry standards that's very successful,'' Logsdon said.
   Warner Bros., whose ``Batman'' clobbered the competition last
summer with $233.7 million in domestic receipts, was not a factor
this season, competing faintheartedly with ``Gremlins 2: The New
Batch'' and the late comer ``Presumed Innocent.''
   As is certain in a season as crowded as this summer, there were
a number of bombs. They included Jack Nicholson's ``The Two
Jakes,'' the Middle East drama ``Navy SEALs,'' Bill Cosby in
``Ghost Dad'' and ``Betsy's Wedding.''
   According to the trade newspaper Daily Variety, the Walt Disney
Co. will edge Paramount for the largest slice of the summer pie.
Counting the continued strong performance of the spring release
``Pretty Woman,'' Disney will wrap the season with about 20 percent
of all tickets sold.
   Boosted by ``Ghost,'' ``Another 48 HRS.'' and ``Days of
Thunder,'' Paramount will collect slightly less. Universal, with 16
percent and a surprise performance from the critically panned
``Problem Child,'' will finish third. 20th century Fox _ led by
``Die Hard 2'' and ``Young Guns II'' _ claims fourth place and
Tri-Star fifth.
   The 1990 summer, Daily Variety said, should be the second best
in Hollywood history, with about $1.85 billion in tickets sold. It
trails only the 1989 season of $2.04 billion.
   According to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., this summer's Top 10
films were, in order, ``Ghost''; ``Total Recall''; ``Die Hard 2'';
``Dick Tracy''; ``Back to the Future Part III''; ``Days of
Thunder''; ``Another 48 HRS.''; ``Bird on a Wire''; ``Presumed
Innocent''; and ``Arachnophobia.''
   ``It's been a strange summer, there's no question about it,''
said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations. ``But it's been
a very good year.''

<HEAD>Program to Combat Motion Disorders in Workplace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is launching a program to
reduce repetitive motion disorders in the workplace, starting with
plants that process red meat, where the rate is 10 times that of
other industries.
   These sometimes crippling disorders account for nearly half of
all occupational disorders in the United States.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, in announcing the initiative
Thursday, said the department has drafted, with the help of unions
and meat industry representatives, a set of guidelines to help
companies deal with the problem.
   ``It's really a common sense approach'' that combines proper
workplace engineering, job design, effective employee training and
education, she said.
   The guidelines will be voluntary, but companies that agree to
follow them would avoid special inspections targeted at repetitive
motion problems, beginning in January 1991, she said.
   ``We think it's a positive agreement,'' said J. Patrick Boyle,
president of the American Meat Institute, which represents 450 meat
processing and packing companies that make up about 95 percent of
the red meat industry.
   Repetitive motion trauma results from repeated motion or awkward
positioning of the hand, arm, back or leg for extended periods.
Disorders include lower back injuries, tendon disorders and carpal
tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist.
   In the meat industry, which employs about 140,000 nationwide,
workers often perform repetitive motions, such as cutting and
lifting.
   In 1988, an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 meatpackers and
processers were among an estimated 140,000 U.S. workers reported to
have repetitive motion disorders, officials said. Experts believe
that half or fewer of the disorders actually are reported.
   The Labor Department is beginning the process of drafting rules
to cover workers in all industries, but she said that could take
years to complete.
   In the meantime, she said, the guidelines for the red meat
industry are an effort to ``eliminate as many illnesses as possible
as quickly as possible.''
   The guidelines will be sent to each red meat plant in the United
States.
   The 16 largest companies, which each have more than 1,000
employees, and later the approximately 20 companies that have more
than 500 workers at a single plant, will be asked to agree to adopt
the guidelines, said Alan McMillan, deputy assistant labor
secretary.
   That would cover more than half of the workers in the beef and
pork industries, he said.
   Smaller businesses will be able to request training and other
technical assistance from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   Companies that agree to the guidelines will be monitored and
OSHA will conduct inspections in response to complaints. But the
companies would not be cited for violations if monitoring showed
they were making progress in eliminating repetitive motion hazards,
Mrs. Dole said.
   Some recommended solutions to repetitive motion problems include
proper design of work stations, employee training, slowing
production rates, limiting overtime and rotating workers among
different jobs.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Die Each Year From Work-Related Illnesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Americans every year die
from diseases they contracted in the workplace, a private research
organization reports.
   ``Occupational disease is the most neglected public health
problem in the U.S. today,'' said the report by the Chicago-based
National Safe Workplace Institute, released Thursday.
   This kind of illness ``is essentially invisible to the public.
Because occupational disease has a long latency period and mimics
other illnesses, most who suffer from it do not even know they
contracted their disease in the workplace,'' the report said.
   The researchers blame much of the problem on the federal
government through what it argued was under funding of enforcement
agencies and inadequate standards.
   The report estimated that occupational diseases _ including
cancer and pulmonary, neurological and cardiovascular diseases
caused by hazards on the job _ killed between 47,377 and 95,479
Americans in 1987. The estimate was based on a study of data
collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, a
government agency.
   The study did not consider on-the-job injuries, which in 1987
killed about 11,100 people and disabled 1.8 million, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   The report said its estimate is consistent with others. It noted
that a 1985 study by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment estimated that American workers get 390,000 job-related
illnesses every year, and 100,000 die.
   ``Even though it is not recognized as such, occupational disease
is clearly one of the most significant causes of premature death in
the U.S. today,'' said the report.
   Dr. Stephen Hessl of the University of Illinois School of
Medicine and Dr. Howard Frumkin of Emory University directed the
study for the institute, a nonprofit research and education
organization financed by foundations and individual donations.
   The institute said the federal government's response to the
problem has been ``timid.''
   Federal spending on workplace health and safety failed to keep
pace with inflation during the Reagan administration in the 1980s,
it said. From 1981 to 1989, spending in this area increased just 12
percent, from $429 million to $481 million, while the Consumer
Price Index rose 36 percent.
   The researchers also criticized the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for often setting permissible workplace
levels of air pollution and exposure to poisons higher than
recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health or permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency for
society at large, they said.
   ``It is outrageous, for example, that it is permissible for
workers to be routinely exposed to levels of sulfur dioxide in the
air that are over 62 times that which is considered a healthy level
for nonworkers,'' the researchers said.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is part of the
Labor Department. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Alan McMillan, deputy assistant labor secretary in charge of
OSHA, said the report overall raised important issues, but he said
he had not read the report thoroughly yet and could not comment
further in detail.
   However, McMillan said OSHA and the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health face different legal requirements in
setting exposure standards.
   The institute is responsible for recommending safe exposure
levels based solely on the worker's health. OSHA, however, must
also consider technical feasibility and economic impact.
   ``For that reason, in most cases you'll likely see a difference
in an OSHA standard and a NIOSH recommendation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Five new reserve units that will boost
transport and public affairs activities in Operation Desert Shield
have been called to active duty, according to the Pentagon.
   That brings to about 8,870 the number of reservists called in
the first wave of notifications, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams
said Thursday.
   The Secretary of the Air Force has called three units:
   _68th Military Airlift Squadron, Kelly AFB, Texas, with 228
personnel involved in support of C-5A transport planes.
   _301st Military Airlift Squadron, Travis AFB, Calif., with 249
personnel involved in support of C-5A and C5B transports.
   _326th Military Airlift Squadron, Dover AFB, Del., with 244
personnel involved in support of C-5A transports.
   The Secretary of the Army has ordered to active duty the
following units:
   _382nd Public Affairs detachment of the National Guard from
Raleigh, N.C.
   _314th Public Affairs Detachment of the Army Reserve from
Birmingham, Ala.
   No personnel figures were given.
   The Pentagon announced last week that about 46,700 reserves
would be called to duty by Oct. 1 and that most of the part-time
soldiers would be posted in or near Saudi Arabia.
   At that time, Williams had projected that about 9,800 reserves
would be called to leave their civilian jobs by the end of August.
   Williams said fewer than expected have been called as the
services have looked more carefully at the need for the reserves.
   He gave the following breakdown for the call up by service:
Army: 4,292; Navy 2,584; Air Force 1,723; Coast Guard 271. No
Marine reserves have been called, as expected, Williams added.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, wrote Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Thursday, asking
that the Pentagon take additional steps to protect the credit
ratings of servicemen and women sent to the Middle East.
   The Texas Democrat said the 50-year-old Soldiers' and Sailors'
Civil Relief Act merely protects newly activated personnel from
foreclosures or repossessions of property in cases where their
military activity caused late payments or interruptions in payments.
   But Bentsen said that law makes no provision for protecting the
credit ratings of service personnel whose financial standing could
be adversely affected by overseas military duty.
   ``I believe you have authority under existing law to help
military personnel who may face this situation,'' the senator told
Cheney.
   Bentsen suggested that men and women activated for service duty
be give an opportunity to authorize the Defense Department to
notify credit bureaus that ``the person's military service may
affect his or her ability to meet previously incurred financial
obligations.''

<HEAD>U.S. Infant Mortality Rate Down; Still High Among Industrialized
Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infant mortality in the United States inched
downward last year to the lowest level ever recorded, but the U.S.
rate is still higher than many industrialized nations, officials
said.
   ``Although we've made progress in reducing this nation's infant
mortality, we must do better,'' Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan said Thursday.
   The provisional data released by the National Center for Health
Statistics would rank the United States below 21 industrialized
countries on a list comparing 1986 rates, center spokeswoman Sandra
Smith said.
   The ranking is probably still accurate, she said.
   ``We make progress, but so do other countries,'' she said.
   The new data shows that U.S. infant deaths for 1989 were 9.7 per
1,000 live births, down from 9.9 per 1,000.
   The 1989 data for infant mortality was not broken down for
blacks and whites, but final data from 1987 shows that while white
infant deaths amounted to 8.6 per 1,000, the rate for blacks was
17.9.
   Sullivan said the United States ``must continue to direct
prevention, education and health care opportunities to our minority
and poor citizens where infant mortality strikes hardest.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Family Ordered Deported to Third Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration authorities have been ordered by
an administrative judge to deport members of a Salvadoran family to
a third country rather than their strife-torn nation.
   A refugee advocacy lawyer hailed the ruling as an important step
toward changing the government's policy of forcing aliens to return
to homelands beset by civil war if they can't prove they are likely
to be harmed.
   ``What this decision stands for is an articulated justification
under international law for a generic approach for providing
protection to those who otherwise would be returned to a civil
war,'' Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project for The
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said Thursday about the Aug. 24
decision.
   Helton estimated there are as many as 500,000 Salvadorans living
in the United States. The INS last year granted 337 applications
for asylum status while denying 13,861.
   ``It's a promising decision and if upheld on appeal would have a
substantial impact on U.S. practice,'' Helton said. But he conceded
that the decision is based on international law rather than federal
immigration law.
   Helton noted that an attempt by an immigration judge several
years ago to invoke an international treaty to stop the deportation
of Salvadorans was overturned on appeal.
   INS authorities are confident that the decision by Immigration
Judge Paul A. Nejelski would be overturned by the Board of
Immigration Appeals, said an official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Congressional Agency Questions Benefits of Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A capital gains tax reduction ``could not be
counted on'' to significantly boost American economic growth, the
Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.
   ``It is unlikely that the increase in income would generate
enough additional tax revenue'' to offset losses to the Treasury,
said the report requested by the congressional tax- and
budget-writing committees.
   During his campaign for the presidency in 1988, President Bush
called cutting the tax rate on capital gains one of his top
priorities. But the Democratic-controlled Congress has refused to
enact the proposal.
   The administration has pressed for a reduction in the capital
gains tax rate during this year's budget negotiations with
lawmakers.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, called the study ``an objective assessment'' of
previous reports on the capital gains tax cut Bush proposed in his
fiscal 1991 budget. Rostenkowski has been a foe of reducing the
capital gains tax rate.

   It's not the forecast they're waiting for _ it's hazy, hot and

   ``The mail, that's what everybody waits for,'' said Dan

<TEXT>
   Political storm clouds are gathering
over the Philippines, creating the perception that President
Corazon Aquino's government faces a grave and perhaps final crisis.
   Such fears have long plagued the Aquino government, which came
to power in the heady days of the 1986 ``people power revolution''
that deposed the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But in the past three weeks, public confidence has plummeted.
Rumors of a new coup attempt are rampant. Commentators believe the
nation is facing a political showdown that may spell the end of
Philippine democracy.
   ``Four years after its restoration, constitutional democracy in
the Philippines is heading toward collapse ahead of the end of
President Aquino's term in 1992,'' wrote Amando Doronila, editor of
the pro-government newspaper, The Manila Chronicle.
   ``The truth is that Philippine democracy today is in imminent
and mortal danger of being overthrown.''
   During four tumultuous years, Mrs. Aquino's government has
weathered numerous crises, including Communist and Moslem
insurgencies and six coup attempts, most recently last December.
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait _ expected to increase oil prices _
a series of natural disasters, and a spate of bombings have brought
the nation to the brink of yet another crisis.
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said one Western
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The public mood is
just awful. It seems like the government is tottering, just waiting
for a push.''
   Following a meeting of newspaper executives, most major Manila
dailies published front-page appeals today to defend democracy
against a new coup attempt.
   But the daily Malaya said the only way out of the crisis was for
Mrs. Aquino to resign and call new elections.
   Philippine presidents served four-year terms under the
constitution in effect when she took office. But the constitution
drafted under the Aquino government granted presidents a single
six-year term.
   ``Given her demonstrable inability to govern ... the country
needs new leadership,'' Malaya said.
   In its editorial, The Manila Standard said that while it opposes
military rule, ``the administration must recognize that the idea
has gained some currency because the many crises that confront us
seem to call for extreme solutions.''
   Natural disasters include the July 16 earthquake _ which killed
more than 1,600 people _ typhoons and a devastating flood that
dumped nearly three feet of rain on the capital Aug. 24.
   The government's clumsy response to the tragedies highlighted
the administration's failures in the business of governing.
   Earthquake recovery operations were hampered by poor
communications and a lack of planning. The torrential rains flooded
large areas of Manila because tons of uncollected garbage had
clogged the drainage systems.
   The Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait threatens the jobs of more
than 500,000 Filipino workers in the Persian Gulf region who pump
$1.3 billion into the national economy each year.
   It also promises to raise fuel prices in a country that relied
heavily on Iraq and Kuwait for oil. In the Philippines oil prices
are regulated by the government and although they have not yet been
raised, increases are expected.
   The spate of bombings in Manila _ 17 since Aug. 13 _ has
prompted fears that military dissidents are poised for a new coup
attempt. One foreign businessman said on condition of anonymity
that many people ``are no longer talking about whether there will
be a coup but when.''
   Faced with the crisis, Mrs. Aquino reversed a long-standing
policy and said Wednesday she was willing to negotiate a
cease-fires with Communist and military rebels. The Cabinet meets
Saturday to discuss prospects for a truce.
   But there has been no clear statement from either military
dissidents or the Communist Party on whether they would go along
with a cease-fire.
   Furthermore, political sources say Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos
strongly opposes a truce, saying it would undercut morale in the
armed forces.
   This apparent split has fueled rumors the armed forces may be
planning a ``constitutional coup,'' establishing some sort of
military-run emergency commission that would run the country, with
Mrs. Aquino as a figurehead.
   Ramos, who crushed the six coup attempts, has strongly denied
the rumors and said Thursday they were spread by dissidents to
foment division in the government.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino's national security adviser, retired
Lt. Gen. Rafael Ileto, said he opposed military rule. But he said
martial law was a viable option ``if the very life of the state is
at stake.''
   ``Each day we become witnesses to the groping for and clutching
at solutions by our leaders,'' wrote left-wing historian Renato
Constantino in the Daily Globe. ``We desperately need a new kind of
politics to restore the morality of power and to revive our
national purpose.''

<TEXT>
   Connecticut has rediscovered a relic from
its Puritan past: Police this summer have charged four people with
adultery.
   In a state known for progressive laws on abortion rights,
education and the environment, use of the rarely enforced state
adultery law is raising eyebrows.
   ``It's a dinosaur,'' said New Haven attorney Hugh Keefe. ``What
a spouse needs if she has a cheating husband is a divorce lawyer,
not a cop.''
   Under the law, a married person commits adultery by having
sexual intercourse with someone other than his or her spouse.
Single people cannot be charged. Conviction on the misdemeanor
charge carries up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   Connecticut authorities say they have no choice but to enforce
the law. Before this year, just two people were charged with
adultery since 1985.
   The latest cluster of arrests ``is basically just a
coincidence,'' said Chief State's Attorney John J. Kelly. ``People
have to realize that we do have a law on the books.''
   Adultery as a criminal offense in America dates from the arrival
of the Puritans in Massachusetts in the 17th century.
   Twenty-seven states still have adultery laws on the books, a
survey by the Harvard Law Review found, but legal scholars say few
states make much effort to enforce them. For example, in New York,
where adultery is a misdemeanor, the last recorded prosecution was
in 1944.
   ``These laws never get repealed,'' said Ronald J. Allen, a
professor at Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago.
``What politician is going to come out in favor of adultery?''
   The first Connecticut arrest this year occurred in Norwich on
June 1, when a man locked in a divorce battle claimed he witnessed
his wife through a window of a house having sex with another man,
police said.
   On Tuesday, police in East Lyme arrested a man and a woman, both
married but not to each other, after receiving a complaint from the
man's wife.
   Police in New London made another arrest Tuesday when they broke
up a domestic squabble over a woman's alleged infidelity, and
arrested the woman after she admitted having an affair.
   For years, divorce lawyers have used the law to keep their
clients' sexual affairs secret. They can do that by having their
clients invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. But lawyers say criminal application of the law
is a different matter altogether.
   ``What are we going to do with these people,'' asked Patty
Jenkins Pittman, a New Haven lawyer. ``Put them on probation? What
would the probation be? Celibacy?''
   Lou Buonfiglio, a private detective in New Haven, agreed. ``I
hope they don't have any witch-burning statutes left on the
books,'' he said.

<HEAD>NASA Cancels Shuttle Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A broken electronic part caused NASA
to scrub Saturday's scheduled launch of space shuttle Columbia,
extending the bad luck that has dogged the space agency all year.
   NASA officials waited until late Thursday night before halting
the countdown for a scientific mission that was to last nine or 10
days. Another attempt won't be made before Wednesday.
   The culprit was in an electronic box that routes electrical
power and telemetry between the spacecraft and an X-ray telescope
mounted at the rear of its cargo bay.
   The launch control center had been unable to issue commands to
the telescope since the shuttle's cargo bay doors were closed
Wednesday evening.
   Engineers suspected a cable might have been pinched and they
sent technicians into the shuttle crew compartment to look at the
electronic box with high-powered binoculars. They saw nothing amiss.
   Another problem cropped up during the countdown that might also
have been _ _ in a favorite NASA phrase _ a show-stopper. A
mid-deck instrument that measures acceleration and vibration also
was faulty. Now, replacement is likely.
   The space agency is under pressure to get the Astro mission
under way by mid-September because of the approaching launch of the
shuttle Discovery with a space probe that is to go into orbit
around the sun.
   For its long journey, the Ulysses probe needs a gravity boost
gained by whipping around the planet Jupiter. Earth and Jupiter
will be in proper alignment for that task between Oct. 5 and Oct.
23 and not again for 13 months.
   On Columbia, officials aren't sure which of two components in
the Broad-Band X-Ray Telescope control box is at fault and the date
of the next launch attempt depends on what they find when they
enter the cargo bay this weekend, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.
   ``We're looking at maybe routing a cable outside the electronic
box which will give us a midweek launch,'' she said. ``If that
doesn't solve the problem, then we'll go inside the box to replace
a component. That would give us a weekend launch.''
   The postponement further damages NASA's frayed shuttle schedule
_ and its reputation. The agency has suffered from the
embarrassments of launching the fuzzy-eyed Hubble telescope,
in-and-out communications with the Magellan spacecraft orbiting
Venus, damaging reports about its proposed space station, and two
leaky shuttles.
   Columbia had been scheduled to be launched on the Astro mission
on May 30, but that attempt was scratched when the hydrogen leak
was discovered during fueling. Later, the shuttle Atlantis also was
found to leak and the fleet was grounded.
   The space agency had hoped to launch nine shuttle flights this
year. To date there have been only three.
   When it finally lifts off, Columbia will have a crew of seven,
the largest since the Challenger accident on Jan. 28, 1986. Four of
the crewmen are astronomers who have trained for the event since
the early 1980s.
   They were to have flown with the observatory in March 1986, in
time to study the comet Halley, then returning from a 76-year round
trip through the universe.
   But the Challenger explosion, on Jan. 28, 1986, stopped all
manned-space activity for 32 months and the mission was put in line
behind higher-priority flights.
   Once in space, the four telescopes on the $150 million
observatory will view some of the hottest objects in the universe,
chronicling the life cycles of stars by measuring their radiation.
Scientists promise that the observatory will make measurements
never before possible with ground-based telescopes.
   ``We really want a success,'' said Ed Weiler, who is the NASA
scientist in charge of the Astro project as well as that of the
Hubble Telescope.
   ``We really want the public to know we can do space astronomy
and we can do it right, and it's something worth doing,'' he said.
``The Hubble problems really give scientists more motivation to be
successful on this mission.''

<HEAD>Author of Provocative Soviet Article Discloses His Identity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Z,'' the author of a provocative article
arguing that Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms are doomed, is Martin
Malia, a Russian historian at the University of California at
Berkeley.
   Malia unmasked himself in an opinion page article in today's New
York Times. His controversial article appeared in the winter issue
of Daedalus, published by the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences; excerpts appeared in the Times in January.
   The article argued that Gorbachev was pursuing only halfway
measures that would not reform the Soviet Union, which labors under
the twin burdens of centuries of Russian authoritarianism and 70
years of communist totalitarianism.
   The article was viewed as flying in the face of the support that
the United States was giving to Gorbachev's policies.
   Malia, a specialist on 19th century Russian intellectual
history, said he signed the article ``N. Perestroikin,'' an obscure
allusion to Vladimir Lenin's pseudonym. But the ``N'' signature was
changed to ``Z'' in the editing process.
   Malia wrote that he had decided to remain anonymous so he
wouldn't compromise his friends in the Soviet Union and because
``the fall of the Berlin Wall and central European communism had
not yet demonstrated that Leninist regimes are mortal.''
   Malia said the pseudonym was no longer necessary because
communism has been defeated in the Soviet Union.
   ``It is manifest that the Soviet Union, modestly aligning itself
with the U.S. and the United Nations, is no longer a superpower,''
he wrote in The Times.
   ``Less obviously, this is so because `the Soviet Union no longer
exists,' as one now hears in Moscow, either as a coherent polity or
economy. And this stunning fact will weigh on world affairs for
years after the Persian Gulf crisis.''
   He cited the March elections that brought to power Soviet
reformers such as Boris Yeltsin who advocate a transition from
totalitarianism to a civil society by dismantling most of the
system as structured by the communists.
   They also call for a pluralistic democracy, reinstatement of
private property and even independence for Soviet republics.
   ``In short, in the past six months the Soviet Union has gone the
way of Central Europe during six weeks last year,'' Malia wrote.
``It has been a slow-motion implosion, just as portentous as the
collapse as the Berlin Wall.''
   Speculation about the identity of ``Z'' had been rampant in
academic and government circles. Some had focused on Malia.
   Others suspected were Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national
security adviser under President Carter; former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger; and retired Lt. Gen. William Odom, former head of
the National Security Agency.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Says He'll Launch Conservation Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans will be urged to drive more
fuel-efficient cars and obey speed limits when the federal
government starts its first energy-conservation advertising
campaign in more than a decade.
   If all Americans took those and other steps, the country could
save 200,000 barrels of oil a day, Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins told The New York Times in an interview published today.
   The new conservation campaign is set to start in mid-September,
Watkins said. He said it is a response to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   At the same time, the government will boost domestic oil
production, Watkins told the Times.
   Before the United Nations embargo went into effect, the United
States imported about 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq and
Kuwait. One-third of that deficit will be resolved by December by
increasing production from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, Watkins said.
   The Energy Department also is seeking another 30,000 barrels a
day from Texas and 50,000 barrels more from companies that have
developed oil reserves off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif.
   Watkins said the Bush administration would try to mediate a
dispute between California, Santa Barbara County and oil companies
over how crude petroleum is to be transported to shore. As well as
being an environmentally delicate area, the coastline is an
important tourist attraction.
   The department also will encourage the use of gasoline that
includes alcohol or methanol, which could save 10,000 barrels of
oil a day if millions more drivers used the fuel.

<HEAD>Billy Graham Official Accused Of Improperly Influencing Donor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of the Rev. Billy Graham's
organization, which has escaped the scandals that have dogged other
ministries, has been accused of improperly influencing an elderly
donor, a published report said today.
   The allegation was made by a Canadian woman's heirs, who sought
a larger share of the $3 million estate of their great aunt, The
Washington Post reported. The newspaper said the claim had been
settled before going to trial.
   The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association had stood to gain more
than one-third of Jessie Geneva Latta's estate through a foundation
named for Latta and established by Carl W. Green.
   The 63-year-old Green left his post as a senior Canadian
fundraiser for the Graham organization last year, the Post said.
   Latta's will was contested by four of her six heirs _ three
great-nieces and a great nephew _ who said in a claim settled in
Brockville, Ontario Monday that Green began to gain Latta's
confidence more than 10 years ago, after her husband died and while
she was in her 80s. Brockville is across the St. Lawrence River
from New York.
   The heirs accused Green of improperly influencing Latta to
rewrite wills in which she had left more money to the heirs than
was specified in the contested will.
   The newspaper said a Graham association spokesman denied the
allegations and Green could not be reached for comment.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Dianne Hickling, one of the
contesting heirs. ``We accomplished what we set out to do.''
   The case was settled after the heirs produced reports from Green
to his superiors in which he detailed repeated visits with Latta.
In the reports, included in the settlement, Green noted Latta's
increasing dependence on him, and his certainty that she would
funnel a significant amount of money to the Graham organization.
   Under the settlement, half of Latta's estate was awarded to the
heirs and half to the foundation with the stipulation that Hickling
replace Green as a director.
   The Graham organization received no money in the settlement and
the heirs were allowed to seek retrieval of about $750,000 in gifts
from Latta to the Graham association before she died in 1988 at age
93. A $100,000 bequest to the association remains in dispute.

<HEAD>CDC Reports Isolating Contaminant in Controversial Diet Supplement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have identified a chemical compound
contaminating some batches of the food supplement L-tryptophan,
which has killed 27 and sickened hundreds.
   The compound was discovered during chromatography tests of
contaminated L-tryuptophan, the national Centers for Disease
Control said Thursday.
   CDC researchers said they still don't know exactly how the
contaminant got in the product. They also have yet to determine
whether the chemical compound is itself the cause of the illness or
just a ``marker'' of another substance.
   Another advance in tracing the cause of the rare blood disorder
called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS, was reported at the
National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md. A model of the
disorder was reproduced there in rats.
   Nationwide, CDC has received reports of 1,536 cases of EMS,
which has been linked to consumption of L-tryptophan, an amino
acid. But the CDC said the number of cases may be higher as many
EMS cases don't meet the official case definition, but still appear
to be related to L-tryptophan.
   ``Maybe our figures might be missing half the cases. I'd say
3,000 to 5,000 is a reasonably good estimate,'' said Dr. Edwin
Kilbourne, chief of health studies at the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health.
   Twenty-seven patients have died from EMS, whose symtoms include
pains, fever, rash and shortness of breath.
   The Food and Drug Administration ordered all L-tryptophan
products off the market this spring. The products were sold through
health food stores as a remedy for conditions including weight
problems, sleeplessness and depression.
   The chemical compound is known as a di-tryptophan aminal of
acetaldehyde. It was identified ``in trace amounts'' in
chromatography tests of 50 lots of L-tryptophan produced by the
implicated manufacturer, said Dr. Larry Needham, toxicology chief
for the CDC's Center for Environmental Health.
   Reports have identified the manufacturer as Japan's Showa Denko
K.K.
   ``It's an impurity,'' Needham said. ``It's not supposed to be in
the product.''
   Lab investigations have found no signs of bacteria or viruses
contaminating the product. But data ``indicate that implicated
L-tryptophan-containing products were contaminated'' with the
chemical compound, the CDC said after nearly a year of
investigation.
   A New England Journal of Medicine report earlier this month
concluded Showa Denko, whose product has been linked to most cases,
made two changes in manufacturing which could have caused the
problem: introduction of a new strain of genetically altered
bacteria, and alteration of its filtering process.

<HEAD>Korean Premiers to Meet For Two Days</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archrivals North and South Korea have
set the details for historic talks between their prime ministers,
opening the way for negotiations on easing four decades of
hostilities, officials said today.
   North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk and about 90 others
are scheduled to cross the heavily fortified border on Tuesday for
two days of talks with South Korean officials, the Information
Ministry said.
   It will be the highest-level contact between the Communist North
and capitalist south since the Korean peninsula was divided in
1945. And security was expected to be tight for the talks, to be
held on Wednesday and Thursday.
   About 3,000 police will ring the hotel where South Korean Prime
Minister Kang Young-hoon and his North Korean counterpart will
meet, the ministry said.
   Thousands more police will be posted around government buildings
and along routes where the delegations are expected to travel,
police said.
   It was agreed that a second round of talks will be held in the
North Korean capital of Pyongyang Oct. 16-19, the ministry said.
   Travel plans and other details were finalized late Thursday
between officials of the two Koreas meeting in Panmunjom, a border
village inside the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two
nations.
   The North Korean delegation, consisting of eight delegates, 33
assistants and 50 reporters, will walk over the border into the
South at Panmunjom and will be driven the 35 miles to the South
Korean capital.
   The Communist delegation is scheduled to leave South Korea on
Sept. 7.
   Although South Korean officials attach great significance to the
talks, observers doubt substantial progress will be made in the
talks because the premiers of both nations are mostly figureheads
without policy-making roles.
   North Korea has said the talks should cover mainly ways to ease
political and military tensions. South Korean officials insist
priority be given to non-political exchanges to promote mutual
confidence.
   North Korea has proposed drastic arms reductions, cutting the
troop level to 100,000 each. North Korea has more than 1 million
troops, while South Korea has 650,000.
   The North Koreans also demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. But
South Korea opposes any drastic measures such as arms cuts before
an extended period of confidence-building.
   In an unprecedented move, South Korea proposed an unrestricted
five-day border opening in mid-August for the 62 million residents
of the two Koreas but North Korea failed to meet Seoul officials to
discuss the matter.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist north and
capitalist south in 1945. The nations fought a three-year war in
the early 1950s. Their border is sealed and direct communication
between their peoples is forbidden.

<TEXT>
   The United States for the first time
has joined with other nations in declaring that human activity is
causing global warming, in a U.N.-sponsored conference that ended
early today.
   After four days of meetings to consider the most extensive
scientific investigation of the Earth's climate, the 74 delegations
unanimously adopted a report that will be a basis for negotiations
on future climate treaties.
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes spent two years
preparing the document, under the auspices of the U.N. Environment
Program and the World Meteorological Organization.
   Scientists and environmentalists described the consensus as a
breakthrough because the United States for the first time
acknowledged human activity is producing gases that are changing
the climate and warming the globe.
   But agreement on the future impact of global warming and
recommendations on possible action to prevent it were not achieved
at the conference.
   ``As far as effective action and impacts, the report is weak,''
said Jeremy Legget, science director for Greenpeace International.
``But the significant achievement is that finally the United States
has acknowledged the global warming is actually happening.''
   Fred Bernthal, head of the National Science Foundation and the
American delegation, said late Thursday that U.S. acceptance of
global warming theories in the document marked a step forward in
climate policy.
   ``We are certain of the following: ... Emissions resulting from
human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric
concentrations of the greenhouse gases,'' Bernthal said.
   ``All things being equal, it (the greenhouse effect) might lead
to global warming,'' he said.
   Bernthal said there is still uncertainty about the magnitude of
the problem, and questions about when and where the effects would
be felt.
   The United States, the largest producer of carbon dioxide, has
blocked any international agreement to place mandatory restrictions
on emission of the gases that lead to the so-called greenhouse
effect.
   Carbon dioxide, produced from the burning of fossil fuels such
as oil and coal, helps trap warm air around the Earth, scientists
say.
   The meeting was marked by extensive argument behind closed doors
between the Americans, who insisted more research is needed, and
European nations committed to an international agreement on
restricting carbon dioxide emissions.
   The scientific conclusions will form the basis for discussions
at the November climate convention in Geneva. The scientists said
they hoped an agreement on action will be ready for signing at the
June 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Officials Listing Alleged Saddam Hussein War Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are compiling a list of
alleged violations of international law to use against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in a Nuremberg-style war crimes trial, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Bush administration could cite the alleged violations to
justify any military action against Iraq, according to
administration sources quoted by the Los Angeles Times.
   The administration also might make the capture of Saddam and his
key advisers for trial one of the objectives of the U.S. buildup in
the Persian Gulf, officials told the Times.
   ``Some (legal) action has to be taken, both because we have a
right to bring him to justice and to deter him from further
violations,'' said an administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In the short term, administration officials said the preparation
of charges was intended to deter Saddam from taking further action
against thousands of civilian hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The report did not state whether plans were being made for
Saddam's capture or in what venue the administration would want to
try the Iraqi leader.
   Among the alleged violations cited by officials is that Saddam
has waged a war of aggression by invading Kuwait on Aug. 2. That
charge formed the basis of the war crimes trials of Nazi leaders in
Nuremberg after World War II.
   Other possible allegations include using chemical weapons,
taking hostages, kidnapping diplomats, violating embassies and
holding captives at military installations, officials said.
   Those actions constitute violations of the 1949 Geneva
Convention and the 1973 New York Convention protecting embassies,
diplomats and their families, the officials said.
   ``Saddam has really put himself in a situation of dire jeopardy
by using civilians,'' said Abraham D. Sofaer, a former State
Department legal adviser. ``It's a clear violation of the laws of

<HEAD>Newspaper: Officials Listing Alleged Saddam Hussein War Crimes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are compiling a list of
alleged violations of international law to use against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in a Nuremberg-style war crimes trial, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Bush administration could cite the alleged violations to
justify any military action against Iraq, according to
administration sources quoted by the Los Angeles Times.
   The administration also might make the capture of Saddam and his
key advisers for trial one of the objectives of the U.S. buildup in
the Persian Gulf, officials told the Times.
   ``Some (legal) action has to be taken, both because we have a
right to bring him to justice and to deter him from further
violations,'' said an administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In the short term, administration officials said the preparation
of charges was intended to deter Saddam from taking further action
against thousands of civilian hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The report did not state whether plans were being made for
Saddam's capture or in what venue the administration would want to
try the Iraqi leader.
   Among the alleged violations cited by officials is that Saddam
has waged a war of aggression by invading Kuwait on Aug. 2. That
charge formed the basis of the war crimes trials of Nazi leaders in
Nuremberg after World War II.
   Other possible allegations include using chemical weapons,
taking hostages, kidnapping diplomats, violating embassies and
holding captives at military installations, officials said.
   Those actions constitute violations of the 1949 Geneva
Convention and the 1973 New York Convention protecting embassies,
diplomats and their families, the officials said.
   ``Saddam has really put himself in a situation of dire jeopardy
by using civilians,'' said Abraham D. Sofaer, a former State
Department legal adviser. ``It's a clear violation of the laws of
war. To intentionally expose civilians for military purposes is a
clear violation of the Geneva Convention.''

   The green battle clothing Spec. 4
Carlotta Coleman donned to exchange her vows wasn't exactly what
she planned to wear on her wedding day _ until she got a call to
report to active duty.
   More than 150 members of the 461st Adjutant General Company
stood in formation Thursday outside the 81st Army Reserve Command
to witness the wedding of the reservist and civilian Charles
Andrews, said Annie Simmons, a command spokeswoman.
   After the ceremony, conducted by a reserve chaplain, Coleman and
other members of the personnel service unit in East Point left in a
convoy for Fort Stewart, near Savannah.
   ``The fact that I have to leave alone is unsettling,'' said the
new Mrs. Andrews, a personnel specialist who will spend 90 days at
Fort Stewart processing soldiers headed to the Middle East.
   ``At least this way I've done what I wanted to do,'' she said.
   The groom, 43, is an Army retiree who served in Vietnam.
   ``It's kind of distressing to get married, then watch your wife
get on the bus and leave,'' Andrews said. ``We'll make the most of
it. The main thing is that we get it done.''
   After the marriage vows and a prayer, Andrews saluted his new
wife once, then two more times while fellow reservists voiced their
approval.
   Members of the 461st were the first full unit of military
reservists expected at Fort Stewart to begin taking over the post's
day-to-day operations after its regular troops went to Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>President Borja Threatens to Shut Down Radio Station Over Report
Or Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rodrigo Borja has threatened to
shut down a radio station if it can't prove its report that his
brother was involved in an illegal weapons deal. If there is
evidence, Borja says he'll resign.
   ``I give Radio Sucre and its staff five days to come up with
proof,'' Borja said Thursday on nationwide television and radio.
   ``If they do, I will present my resignation to the Ecuadorian
people. But if they do not, I will exercise my powers as president
and will order the immediate cancellation of Radio Sucre's
broadcasting license,'' he said.
   Radio Sucre, a frequent critic of the Borja government owned by
a right-wing opponent, accused one of Borja's brothers of taking
part in a $52,000 arms deal with the armed forces.
   The radio station did not specify which of Borja's four brothers
was involved, and details of the alleged arms deal were not
immediately clear.
   Borja, a leftist who has served two years of his four-year term,
said he had to defend the dignity of both the presidency and the
armed forces.
   ``I have maintained total respect for the freedom of expression
of all Ecuadorians,'' Borja said. ``But everything has a limit.''
   Radio Sucre's accusation, he said, ``transgresses the limits of
democratic tolerance.''
   Radio Sucre of Guayaquil, 170 miles southwest of Quito, is owned
by Vicente Arroba, congressman for the rightist Social Christian
Party. The party, led by ex-president Leon Febres Cordero, is
Borja's main opposition in Congress.
   The station has frequently accused Borja's ministers of
corruption.
   The accusation came one day before the Supreme Court on
Wednesday found Febres Cordero and his son-in-law, Miguel Orellana,
innocent of embezzlement charges. Febres Cordero was president from
1984 to 1988.
   In 1987, Orellana, who was also Febres Cordero's private
secretary, received $150,000 in cash from Ecuador's Central Bank.
He later said the money was payment to Israeli anti-terrorism
expert Ram Gazit for advice in fighting a small leftist guerrilla
movement then active in Ecuador.
   Orellana said he could not present proof of how the funds were
used because Gazit was unable to appear in his defense for security
reasons.
   Febres Cordero accused ``political enemies,'' among them Borja,
of being behind the charges. He said his rivals wanted to discredit
him with a smear campaign.

   Nancy Cruzan's parents again are
seeking satisfaction from the legal system that has blocked their
three-year battle to let the comatose woman die.
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan say they have new evidence that their
33-year-old daughter wouldn't want to continue living in her
condition.
   Nancy Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since a
January 1983 car crash, and is kept alive at a state hospital by a
surgically implanted feeding tube.
   Three witnesses have come forth ``who had specific discussions
with Nancy Cruzan regarding her wishes about life-sustaining
medical treatment,'' attorney Bill Colby, who represents the
parents and their daughter, said in a petition filed Thursday with
Charles Teel, a Jasper County probate judge.
   No date for a hearing was immediately set, Colby said.
   In July, in its first ruling in a ``right-to-die'' case, the
U.S. Supreme Court barred the removal of the life-sustaining tube.
It said a state's interest in preserving life may overcome the
wishes of family members seeking to end the life of a patient in an
irreversible, coma-like condition.
   ``I feel this is a wrong that has to be righted,'' Joe Cruzan
said in an interview from his home in Carterville in southwest
Missouri. ``We don't feel this is right for every family, but we
feel we're doing what Nancy would want.''
   ``I don't know where it's going to end,'' he said. ``I hope
we're successful. I gave up being enthusiastic a long time ago,
when I learned the legal system doesn't work very fast.''
   In Thursday's petition, Colby said the Supreme Court ruled ``the
discovery of new evidence regarding the patient's intent'' could
allow for modification or reversal of the ban on removing her
feeding tube.
   The petition said the court ruled that Missouri can require
``clear and convincing'' evidence as a legal standard of proof of
Ms. Cruzan's wishes before medical treatment is terminated.
   Colby declined in an interview to disclose the identities of the
three people, other than to say two were people Ms. Cruzan had
worked for and the third was a co-worker. The conversations took
place about three years before the car crash, he said.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who handled the
state's challenges to the Cruzan family, had no immediate comment
on the filing, said his spokeswoman, Mary Jenkins.
   Cruzan said of his legal battles: ``I feel frustrated, and some
degree of anger, but primarily frustration at the system.''
   The 55-year-old sheetmetal worker said he considered taking his
daughter to a state that might allow termination of artificial
feeding, but rejected the idea because ``I thought it was wrong.''
   The Cruzans visit their daughter weekly at the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon.
   Ms. Cruzan's body is rigid with her hands and feet bent into
claw shapes. She can breathe on her own, and at times her eyes are
open and move randomly.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Higher in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and stocks
closed higher today, despite the previous day's increase in Japan's
official discount rate.
   The dollar finished the week at 144.50 yen, up 0.40 yen from
Thursday's finish. The U.S. currency opened at 144.45 yen and
ranged between 144.13 yen and 144.55 yen.
   The dollar gained despite Thursday's discount rate hike because
the increase was smaller than expected, said Yoshitsugu Hanada, a
dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   On Thursday, the Bank of Japan raised its official discount
rate, its lending rate to commercial banks, to 6 percent from the
previous 5.25 percent, effective immediately.
   Local media and financial markets had expected the bank would
raise the rate by as much as 1 percentage point.
   Higher interest rates generally make a nation's currency more
attractive to investors and discourage stock purchasers.
   ``Investors have sold the dollar for a while because of the lack
of developments in the Middle East crisis, but I think the dollar's
downtrend has reversed,'' Hanada said.
   The U.S. currency is frequently seen as a safe haven in times of
crisis, and earlier worry about the Gulf situation had sent it
higher, despite basic concerns about the U.S. economy, traders said.
   Market players were buying the U.S. currency to make up for
their recent oversold positions, Hanada said.
   Trading was inactive, with about $7 billion trading hands in
spot dealings.
   Investors were reluctant to make major moves ahead of a
three-day weekend in New York, dealers said. U.S. financial markets
will be closed Monday for Labor Day.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
308.41 points, or 1.2 percent, ending the day at 25,978.37. The
index rose 775.17 points on Thursday following the announcement of
the discount rate increase. Trading was moderate, with 600 million
shares traded on the first section.
   Stock prices started lower today, with many investors
discouraged by an overnight decline in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the yen's downturn against the dollar, traders said.
   They said the index started recovering as institutional
investors made arbitrage purchases in the spot market to take
profits from the price gap between spot and futures values.
   Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said
bargain hunting also helped the index today.
   ``But selling by some investors to reduce holdings before the
weekend prevented the index from rising further,'' he said.
   Satoru Nagayoshi, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
stability in the bond market reassured investors and helped support
the stock market.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.105 percent, down from
Thursday's 8.120 percent. Their price rose to 83.07 from 83.00.

<HEAD>Radar System That Might Have Warned of Twisters Wasn't Working</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tornado-warning radar system had been disabled
by lightning hours before killer twisters struck several towns in
northern Illinois, a National Weather Service forecaster said today.
   But the forecaster said he didn't believe the system could have
forecast the tornadoes that killed 27 people and injured more than
300 Tuesday across a region known as ``Tornado Alley,'' about 35
miles southwest of Chicago.
   The weather service's Chicago office issued a severe
thunderstorm warning for the area, but did not alert residents to
the tornadoes until six minutes after they had touched down in the
communities of Plainfield and Crest Hill.
   The office is equipped with an early version of Doppler radar,
which might have provided five to 10 minutes advance warning of the
twisters, said forecaster Carl Williams.
   ``But there's just no way that you can say that it could have
done that,'' Williams said in a telephone interview. ``It's a
primitive system and I don't think it's being out had any effect at
all.''
   Williams said the Doppler radar has not been in wide use in most
weather service offices, but an ``add-on'' Doppler was installed in
1974 on radar equipment dating back to 1957.
   But the Doppler radar in Chicago was knocked out by lightning
hours before Tuesday's storms.
   The Doppler system can detect both those winds that are
approaching and moving away. When winds are detected moving in both
directions at the same time and at high speeds, meteorologists can
quickly determine that they are dealing with a tornado.
   A newer system called NEXRAD is being tested at the weather
service's National Severe Storms Laboratory, officials said. But
that system may not be installed until 1995, Williams said.
   The New York Times reported today that the weather service has
dispatched a team of researchers from the National Severe Storms
Laboratory at Norman, Okla., to assess the effectiveness of its
forecasters and timeliness of the alerts they issued Tuesday.
   ``We will do a complete assessment of the event,'' Robert
Maddox, director of the laboratory, told the newspaper. ``We will
look at the weather observations and the data available to forecast
offices, and if the team can agree on them we will offer
recommendations for improvements.''
   Calls to the Oklahoma lab went unanswered early today.

   A federal appeals court overturned Wayne
Newton's record $5.2 million libel judgment, saying the jury didn't
prove NBC News was deliberately false or reckless in suggesting the
singer had ties to the mob.
   In dismissing Newton's lawsuit, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled 3-0 Thursday that any false impressions in the 1980
broadcast did not result from the type of journalistic misconduct
required for libel lawsuits by public figures.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled public figures must prove that
defamatory statements were either deliberate falsehoods or
recklessly disregarded the truth.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said he would not comment until
he could reach Newton.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that NBC's story falsely implied that
the Mafia had helped Newton buy the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in
exchange for a hidden interest.
   It awarded Newton $19.3 million, but that was reduced to $5.2
million, mostly in punitive damages, after U.S. District Judge
Myron Crocker found that Newton's income and reputation had not
suffered.
   Thursday's ruling said most of the broadcast's factual
statements were true: Newton had a friend with purported mob ties
who had done him a favor, and had then talked with an associate
about the possibility of profiting from Newton's ownership of the
Aladdin; a federal grand jury had investigated that subject; and
Newton had testified falsely to the Nevada Gaming Board.
   Although the broadcast did not specify the favor that had been
done for Newton _ according to Newton, getting a criminal
organization to stop threatening him and his daughter _ the court
said the omission was not libelous. The reporters had reason to
doubt the story of the threats, which had been denied by Newton's
lawyer in Newton's presence, the court said.
   Among the reasons NBC gave for challenging the verdict was
Crocker's refusal to transfer the trial out of Las Vegas, where an
annual Wayne Newton Day is celebrated and a street is named after
him.
   ``Wayne Newton's case poses the danger that First Amendment
values will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of a
prominent local public,'' said the opinion by Judge William Norris.
   ``I don't think the jury was as much biased against NBC as it
was prone to support Wayne Newton,'' Floyd Abrams, a prominent
libel lawyer representing NBC, said Thursday. He said the decision
would not have been rendered outside of Las Vegas.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner called the ruling ``a sound
victory for investigative journalism.''

   A gasoline station that promoted
``Pre-Crisis Prices'' drew two half-mile-long lines of cars rolling
past an effigy of Iraq President Saddam Hussein.
   The wait for gas at 97.3 cents per gallon at Autotronics Amoco
Garage lasted about an hour in 90-degree weather. Regular unleaded
has been selling for about $1.31 a gallon at the station.
   For three hours, the station lowered prices to near their levels
before Saddam's invasion of Kuwait pushed costs up a month ago.
   The difference was enough for Keith Jones' one-hour wait.
   ``I figure you got to go to the gas station anyway. You got to
get out and pump it. That'll take you 15 minutes. And it'll save
you 43 cents,'' Jones said.
   ``I've always got more time than money.''

   The West and Northeast had clear skies today, with the prospect
of sunshine and warmth through Labor Day.
   Thunderstorms were expected to sweep through the Southeast.
   Winds gusting to near 60 mph caused damage around Daytona Beach
and elsewhere in Florida on Thursday, large hailstones pelted parts
of Alabama and Georgia and five people were injured by a lightning
strike on the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, N.C.
   Nearly 2 inches of rain fell in six hours Thursday in the
Wilmington area and an 1}-inches of rain was recorded at
Valparaiso, Fla., as heavy rainfall soaked the South.
   Rain also fell in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Indiana,
Illinois, Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, Montana and
Washingston state.
   Heat records for the date were tied or broken in cities from
Wyoming to Florida. The high temperature for the nation was 114
degrees at Borrego Springs, Calif.
   The Labor Day weekend forecast calls for hotter than average
temperatures in most areas, with high humidity in the South and
Plains states. More rain is likely in the South, with scattered
thunderstorms elsewhere.
   The holiday should be sunny and warm throughout the West,
Northeast, and many other areas of the nation, with low to moderate
humidity.

<TEXT>
   The Arab League has urged member nations
with ideas for a diplomatic way out of the Persian Gulf crisis to
come forward, and said any settlement of the crisis must include
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   But Arab diplomatic sources said the league would likely be
unable to come up with a viable diplomatic solution to the
month-old conflict in its two-day emergency session, at which eight
of 21 members were absent.
   Arab foreign ministers were expected to end the meeting today by
condemning for a second time Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and
demanding Baghdad's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from its
oil-rich neighbor. Iraq has declared Kuwait part of its territory.
   The sources said the main aim of the meeting was to embarrass
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for ignoring the Aug. 10 appeal by
Arab leaders at the Cairo summit.
   At the summit, 12 Arab nations also said they regarded the
deposed emir of Kuwait as the nation's legitimate ruler, and agreed
to send troops to Saudi Arabia to protect it against a possible
Iraqi invasion.
   Egypt, Syria and Morocco have sent small troop contingents to
coordinate with U.S. and other forces countering Iraq in the
Persian Gulf region.
   Under Arab League rules, resolutions accepted by simple
majorities are binding only on members voting for them.
   League Secretary-General Chadli Klibi said Thursday's meeting
had reviewed reports on efforts by some Arabs to achieve a
settlement.
   He was apparently referring to peace proposals by the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Kuwait has rejected that initiative
because it involves some form of federation between Kuwait and Iraq.
   Other Arabs states, included Jordan and Sudan, are involved in
diplomatic efforts.
   In its statement Thursday, the league asked any members with
peace initiatives to propose them, but said any solution must
involve both an Iraqi withdrawal and restoration of Kuwait's
deposed government.
   Klibi read the statement to reporters following a three-hour
meeting of officials from 13 Arab League nations.
   In addition to Iraq, those staying away were Jordan, Sudan,
Yemen, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and the PLO. They all opposed,
abstained or expressed reservations in the vote on the summit
resolution.
   The ministers Thursday formed a six-nation committee to draft a
resolution. The panel comprised of Bahrain, Libya, Kuwait, Egypt,
Syria and Saudi Arabia.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said the committee also
would ``look at the initiatives taken by some Arab countries.''
   Attending the conference were the 12 League members who
supported the summit resolution, plus Libya. The 12 were Egypt,
Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Morocco, Lebanon, Somalia and Djibouti.
   Libya had been expected to boycott the ministerial meeting.
   Egyptian officials said Cairo requested the ministerial session
in line with a stipulation of the summit resolution that Klibi
report within 15 days on its implementation.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Confirms Holding Thousands of African Nationals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Liberian rebel leader claims his
forces hold several thousand citizens of countries participating in
the five-nation West African force sent to Liberia to end the
tribal war.
   A force of 3,000 men from Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Guinea
and Gambia landed in Monrovia's port last weekend. The force hopes
to end the 8-month-old war between President Samuel Doe and two
rebel factions.
   One rebel leader, Charles Taylor, opposed the force and attacked
it shortly after its arrival. Reporters traveling with the force
say the rebels were driven off by the task force's heavy weaponry.
   Taylor, who on Thursday telephoned the British Broadcasting
Corp. in London from Liberia, said he is holding nationals of
countries participating in the multinational force.
   ``What we are we doing right now is not unlike what other
countries have had to do to protect the lives of citizens of
countries involved in wars with other countries,'' Taylor said.
   The rebel leader said his rebels evacuated several thousand
people, mostly Nigerians and Ghanaians, from front-line areas to
stop ``angry mobs of Liberians from killing them. It is for their
security and for our security.''
   Taylor denied he had threatened to kill the foreign nationals if
any of his rebels were killed by the force but said he could not be
expected ``to kiss Nigerians on the cheek.''
   Taylor said, ``What I am saying to you is that I am not going to
tolerate any nation coming into Liberia and killing Liberians.''
   Meanwhile, a conference of opposition groups, churchmen and
business leaders, meeting in Banjul, Gambia, was expected to make a
recommendation on who should head any interim government, pending
fresh elections.
   Leaders of the five-nation military force have said an interim
government would be installed as soon as fighting ended. Neither
Taylor, the second rebel leader, Prince Johnson, nor Doe would be
in the government, the leaders said.
   Taylor's forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast in December
and advanced largely unchecked until they reached the outskirts of
the capital of Monrovia. They have been unable to dislodge troops
loyal to Doe. Johnson's rebels, who split with Taylor, have taken
control of much of the capital.
   Johnson and Doe have agreed to a truce and both support efforts
to end the war. They both want the resignation of Doe.

   A man convicted of five murders was put to
death by injection early today for killing an elderly woman 11
years ago.
   George C. Gilmore, 44, was declared dead at 12:10 a.m. at the
maximum-security Potosi Correctional Center.
   ``He had no last words,'' said prison spokesman Dale Riley.
   A brother, a niece and a fiancee who were not identified wept
and covered their faces with their hands as officials announced the
fatal delivery of sodium pentothal, Pavlon and potassium chloride
into a tube in Gilmore's arm.
   Strapped to a gurney and covered to his chin by a blanket,
Gilmore strained at first to see his friends and mouthed what
appeared to be ``I love you.''
   Then he turned his head to the side and was still. Two minutes
later he was declared dead.
   Gilmore was executed for killing 83-year-old Mary Luella Watters
in August 1979. He also had received the death sentence for three
other murders and was given a life prison term for a fourth.
   His partner in crime, Leonard Laws, was executed May 17.
   Authorities say Gilmore and Laws killed five people in a St.
Louis-area crime spree, targeting elderly or helpless people for
robbery and murder.
   Law enforcement officials expressed little sympathy for Gilmore.
   Richard D. Moore, director of the state Department of
Corrections, told official witnesses that the method of execution
was humane and ``a far cry from the terror and horror George
Gilmore put each of his victims through.''
   ``It's pretty sad when it takes 11 years,'' said St. Louis
County Prosecutor George ``Buzz'' Westfall.
   A series of appeals Thursday failed to stop the execution, the
137th nationwide and the fifth in Missouri since the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976 let states resume use of the death penalty.
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused by a 6-1 vote to block Gilmore's
death. Justice Thurgood Marshall, who opposes the death penalty in
all circumstances, dissented. Justice Antonin Scalia did not take
part in the case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward L. Filippine and the U.S. 8th
Circuit Court of Appeals also dismissed Gilmore's appeals Thursday.
   Appeals filed for Gilmore by lawyers Kevin Collins and James
Delworth alleged mitigating evidence had not been considered
earlier. Gilmore, the son of two alcoholics, suffered fetal alcohol
syndrome and organic brain damage, Delworth said.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster's office rejected
those arguments.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS INDEPENDENCE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite earlier reports of
cat-and-mouse maneuvers, U.S. Navy officers say American and Iraqi
fighters have been steering clear of each other and are careful not
to cross boundary lines.
   Officers aboard the aircraft carrier Independence said Thursday
that U.S. Navy forces were operating cautiously so as not to
provoke a confrontation as the United Nations tries to negotiate a
resolution to the standoff caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   U.S. pilots are stopping short of waters off Kuwait and Iraqi
pilots appear to be staying well behind Kuwaiti and Iraqi borders
as well, said Rear Adm. Jerry Unruh, commander of the USS
Independence battle group. F-14 and F-18 jets launched from the
Independence are conducting missions in the gulf.
   Iraq has also not lately taken any steps that would indicate
``hostile intentions,'' he said. Unruh attributed Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's strategy to the strong deterrent forces in the
region and economic sanctions on Iraq.
   Last week there were reports American pilots locked their
weapons radar on Iraqi planes in what one crew chief described as
``a little cat-and-mouse,'' although they said the Iraqis had
refused go along with the game.
   The reports were not confirmed by the Pentagon or by U.S.
commanders in Saudi Arabia.
   Unruh spoke to a group of reporters aboard the Independence, a
Forrestall-class aircraft carrier stationed just south of the gulf.
   The F-14s and F-18s are being launched north into the gulf to
protect other naval vessels patrolling the area.
   Unruh said Iraq has Exocet and Silkworm missiles in Kuwait ``but
we have no indication that they are ready to employ them for use
against our ships or aircraft.''
   As for the embargo, Unruh said, U.S., British and French ships
surrounding the Arabian peninsula were tracking 50-75 ships a day
in their efforts to block any commercial ships from leaving Iraq
and any ships except those carrying medicine from delivering goods
to Iraq.
   Unruh said there were few problems associated with the crowded
airspace in the gulf area, which in addition to commercial traffic
includes hundreds of military jets and transports used for the
multinational defense of Saudi Arabia.
   But one of the carrier's squadron leaders said fighter pilots
were carrying fewer long range missiles on their missions because
they wanted to make visual identification of all targets.
   ``One of our worries is fratricide,'' said Commander Sel
Laughter of the Black Knights F-14 squadron.
   Another squadron commander, Dave Nickle, paused when asked how
he would feel if assigned to attack an Iraqi target knowing the
site might also be the holding place of Western hostages.
   Nickle glanced down at the floor for several seconds before
saying, ``Our job is to go hit that target and that's what we're
going to do. Somebody else has to worry about hostages.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities said a woman
illegally injected liquid silicone into the breasts of several
women, one of whom may have to go undergo a mastectomy.
   Authorities are looking for Sookie Y. Ricketts, 42, who is
charged with two misdemeanor counts of practicing medicine without
a license, District Attorney John Suthers said Thursday.
   An arrest warrant was issued Aug. 6 for Ricketts, 42, whose last
known address was in Marietta, Ga., he said.
   Ricketts allegedly charged several women thousands of dollars
each to perform the procedure at her Colorado Springs home in late
May, Suthers said.
   ``It was the equivalent of a Tupperware party,'' he said.
   Doctors in the United States discontinued use of silicone
injections in the 1960s, and now use sealed bags of sterile
silicone or saline, said Dr. Lawrence Ketch, chief of plastic and
reconstructive surgery at the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center.
   Silicone that is injected is likely to break up and move to
other parts of the body, causing grotesque and sometimes painful
lumps under the skin, Ketch said.
   The practice of having an unlicensed person inject unpurified
silicone into the body is accepted in many countries, but is
illegal in this country, he said.
   A woman who sold a diamond ring worth thousands of dollars to
pay for the treatment suffered an acute infection several days
after being injected by Ricketts, Ketch said. She was treated with
antibiotics, he said.
   ``It's not life threatening to her, but sooner or later she will
have to have her breast removed,'' Ketch said.

<HEAD>Baby's Marrow Donation to Ailing Sister Postponed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors will wait until at least next year
before attempting a bone marrow transplant from a baby conceived as
a possible donor for her leukemia-stricken sister.
   Doctors had said 5-month-old Marissa Eve Ayala could safely
donate sufficient bone marrow for her 18-year-old sister, Anissa,
as early as 6 months of age.
   But a decision was made to wait until early 1991, to give the
12-pound Marissa time to grow and because her sister's leukemia is
stabilized.
   As long as Anissa's leukemia remains stable, ``physicians would
prefer to let Marissa grow and mature until about a year of age,''
Charlie Mathews, spokesman for the City of Hope Medical Center,
said Thursday.
   The decision by Mary and Abe Ayala to have a baby as a potential
donor for their daughter drew attention from medical ethicists, who
voiced concern about creating one child to save another.
   Waiting until Marissa is larger will allow for the extraction of
more bone marrow. There is little risk for the baby, doctors have
said.
   Mrs. Ayala said doctors had suggested performing the marrow
transplant in December but the family wanted to wait until after
Christmas.
   The chance that a bone marrow transplant will cure Anissa of the
leukemia, a cancer of white blood cells, has been reported as
between 70 percent and 80 percent. The family had been unable to
find a suitable donor.
   Fetal cells withdrawn during amniocentesis, pre-birth testing,
showed ``virtually 100 percent that Marissa would be a perfect
match for Anissa,'' Mathews said.

   The American hostage who died this week in
Iraq was banker James L. Worthington Jr., his family disclosed.
   Worthington, 53, a native of Marathon, Texas, died Monday, his
daughter told the Daily Freeman of Kingston on Thursday.
   ``He was taken hostage in Kuwait and moved to Basra where he
died of a heart attack,'' said Maggie Jean Neilson, 27, of
Woodstock. She said that information came from the U.S. State
Department.
   State Department spokeswoman Gloria Berbena would not confirm
the dead hostage's identity.
   Earlier this week, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the body of
an American who died in the city of Basra would be turned over to
the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
   Worthington had been working as a consultant for the Alahi Bank
of Kuwait and lived in the Hilton Hotel in Kuwait City, family
members said. The State Department notified his wife, Katharine W.
Worthington, of his death.
   When not overseas, Worthington lived with his wife, two
children, and mother-in-law in Woodstock, about 90 miles north of
New York City.
   Before moving to Kuwait, Worthington worked for 28 years in
various foreign branches of Citibank. He was stationed, with his
family, in Colombia, Brazil, Liberia, Indonesia, Singapore and
India. He worked at the bank's main branch in New York City just
before his tenure in Kuwait, Neilson said.

   A freighter that was stopped, searched and boarded
by the U.S. Navy as part of the enforcement of the embargo against
Iraq is trying to find a port that will accept its cargo, a
shipping newspaper said today.
   Lloyd's List International said Pacific International Lines of
Singapore, owner of the Kota Wirama, intended to make a second
attempt to send the freighter to the Jordanian port of Aqaba.
   Aqaba had been Iraq's last major link to world trade, and U.S.
officials have said the flow has largely come to a halt as a result
of the embargo, imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The paper quoted unidentified sources in London as saying the
ship was suspected of carrying chemicals for Iraq as well as food
and other goods.
   U.S. military sources have said that U.S. warships have
intercepted about 170 ships and boarded at least 10 in the Persian
Gulf and Red Sea since President Bush issued his Aug. 16 order to
enforce the embargo.
   The military sources said that while most ships were allowed to
continue, Navy boarders found at least two with Iraq-related cargo
and persuaded them to change their sailing plans.
   The newspaper quoted an executive with Pacific International
Lines as saying he ``had no knowledge of chemicals on board Kota
Wirama or whether the cargo included items for Iraq.''
   The Kota Wirama's cargo came from various ports, including
Shanghai and Singapore, and it was bound for for the Red Sea, Aden,
Mombasa and Dar es Salaam, the paper said.
   Lloyd's List International _ a daily paper that reports on
shipping, insurance, energy, trade and finance _ is published in
London by the Lloyd's of London insurance market.

<HEAD>Report: European Hostages May Benefit From Events</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed leader of captors holding
Westerners in Lebanon said recent actions by European nations could
hasten the release of some European hostages, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Ad-Diyar newspaper quoted Hussein Musawi saying factions
holding six Americans and seven Europeans ``distinguish between''
the stance of the United States and some European countries
regarding events in the Mideast since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
   Musawi, who heads a pro-Syrian wing of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, also cited Britain's acknowledgment
that ``The Satanic Verses'' novel could offend Moslems and France's
release of a Lebanese prisoner accused of trying to assassinate an
Iranian diplomat.
   ``Moslem factions concerned with the European and American
hostages distinguish between the American and European stands,''
the newspaper quoted Musawi as saying.
   He gave no indication when any hostages might be freed, but
noted ``Europeans would be in a more favorable position than
others.''
   Hezbollah, Iran's closest ally in Lebanon, is believed to have
links to factions holding six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans and an Italian.
   Three European hostages have been freed in recent weeks. Two
American hostages, Frank Reed and Robert Polhill, were freed in
April.
   Swiss Red Cross workers Elio Erriquez and Emanuel Christen were
freed earlier this month. They were kidnapped in south Lebanon Oct.
6, 1989.
   Brian Keenan, a teacher with dual Irish-British citizenship, was
released Aug. 24 after nearly 4{ years in captivity.
   French President Francois Mitterrand recently released Anis
Naccache, who was serving a life sentence for the 1980 attempted
assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in
Paris.
   British officials this month noted that Salman Rushdie's ``The
Satanic Verses'' could be offensive to Moslems. Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issued a death sentence on Rushdie in February 1989 for
blaspheming the Moslem religion in the book. Rushdie has been in
hiding.
   Musawi said that ``such stands would undoubtedly be understood
as goodwill gestures by the Europeans and, therefore, it must
affect positively the situation of the European hostages.''
   Musawi said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
on Aug. 16 that he believed no American hostages would be freed
because of the U.S. military intervention in the gulf.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait and massed tens of thousands of
soldiers on the Saudi border, the United States began deploying
troops to defend Saudi Arabia.

   Jordanian military planes are flying spy
missions along the Saudi border to supply Iraq with information on
troop movements, an Israeli military source said today.
   The source, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the Jordanian reconnaissance flights are being flown by
U.S.-made F-5 jets, giving a view of troop movements dozens of
miles into Saudia Arabia.
   The source described the areas reportedly being watched by the
Jordanian craft as sectors along the Saudi-Jordan border that Iraq
cannot cover without being obvious or risking confrontation.
   It said Jordanian military aircraft also have stepped up flights
along the Jordanian-Israeli border to watch for Israeli troop
movements.
   Throughout the Persian Gulf crisis, Israel has warned that any
entry by Iraqi troops into Jordan would bring Israeli military
retaliation.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, warned Iraq today
against attempting to strike Israel. President Chaim Herzog tried
to calm public fears by saying the Iraqi army is ``not the mighty
monster'' it is made out to be.
   They were reacting to an Iraqi air force commander's threat a
day earlier ``of dealing smashing blows to the nests of the
Israelis.''
   Also, a leading Israeli military analyst said the latest threat
marked an escalation in the war of words with Iraq and called for a
reassessment of the dangers facing the Jewish state.
   ``Up until now Israel considered an Iraqi attack only a low
probability,'' said Zeev Schiff, military writer for the Hebrew
daily Haaretz. ``Now we have to reassess and consider an Iraqi
attack on Israel as an act of desperation.''
   He added: ``Although Saddam Hussein has up until now only
threatened to attack Israel if Israel attacks him, now the Iraqis
are announcing that in the event of a war they will attack Israel
missiles and planes even if Israel doesn't lift a finger.''
   Israel has been keeping a low profile since the gulf crisis was
set off Aug. 2 with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But it has also
made it clear that it is worried about the Iraqi threat and
prepared to handle any Iraqi aggression.
   Israel fears that any settlement in the gulf may leave Saddam in
place, where he will continue to be a threat to the Jewish state.
   Officials here also have objected to planned arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, saying that the sales of U.S.-made fighter jets, tanks and
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles would reduce Israel's ``qualitative
edge'' in Middle East weaponry.
   The crisis is expected to be a topic of discussion Wednesday in
Washington between Foreign Minister David Levy and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   The Jerusalem Post said ``partial answers'' have been received
on enhancing U.S. weapons packages for Israel, which receives $1.8
billion a year in U.S. military aid.
   Shamir warned Saddam that ``any aggressor would live to regret
his actions.''
   Herzog, in the text of a speech to be broadcast nationwide
today, urged the public to remain calm.
   ``True, we are dealing with a cruel tyrant,'' Herzog said. ``But
the picture as of now is not of a man trying to widen his field of
combat.''
   He added: ``I am not saying the Iraqi army, in these conditions,
is a paper tiger. ... But it is certainly not the mighty monster
described by so many in the media.''
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens told Israel radio ``We are
prepared, ready and calm.''
   The military source, meanwhile, contended today that Jordan was
helping Saddam in several ways in addition to the reconnaissance
flights.
   The source claimed that Jordan is importing food and medicine,
then passing it on to Iraq to help subvert the Western embargo.
   ``They can import for themselves and then send these goods to
Iraq ... and this is what they are doing,'' he said.
   In answer to a question, he said there was no evidence Jordan
was sending military equipment to Iraq.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Link Between TMI Radiation and Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There is no evidence that radiation
emissions during the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island
affected the health of area residents, an independent study
released today concludes.
   The study by Columbia University scientists said there was no
sign that the radiation caused leukemia or childhood cancers among
people living within 10 miles of the plant. Those illnesses are
more sensitive to low-level radiation than other diseases and are
the first to appear after exposure, the scientists said in a
briefing several miles from the nuclear plant near Harrisburg.
   The findings were published today in the American Journal of
Epidemiology. They match the conclusions of a 1985 report, released
by the state Health Department, that found no evidence of increased
cancers in a 20-mile radius.
   In the latest study, Columbia epidemiologists Mervyn Susser and
Maureen Hatch studied the health records of 160,000 residents of 69
areas within the 10-mile radius. They also compared cancer rates
between 1975 and 1985. The accident, the worst at a U.S. commercial
nuclear plant, happened in 1979.
   During the accident, which crippled the Unit 2 reactor,
radioactive gases were vented into the atmosphere.
   The study expands on a report given in June to the American
Society of Epidemiologists. That report found no association
between TMI accident emissions and childhood cancers in a 10-mile
radius around the plant.
   Hatch said the June report was withheld from the public until
today because of a release embargo set by the scientific journal
that published the findings.
   The study was funded by the Three Mile Island Public Health
Fund, which was established to study issues related to the
accident. The fund was established as part of a $5 million
settlement of a 1981 class-action lawsuit against the owners of TMI.
   In 1986, the fund's administrators subpoenaed hospitals for
health records used in the study.
   The report has been complete for a number of months, but
publication was delayed because of revisions by the authors and
peer review.
   The accident at TMI 2 occurred after a combination of human and
mechanical errors caused protective cooling water to be drained
from the reactor. Some of the reactor's cache of nuclear fuel
melted, and radiation was released into the environment. The
accident was the worst to happen at a commercial nuclear power
plant in the United States.
   Despite the findings of government reports, some community
members continue to assert the accident left a legacy of illness
that has yet to be officially recognized.
   Kay Pickering, a spokeswoman for Three Mile Island Alert, a
citizens group, said she doubted that a statistical study would go
far enough to fully disclose health effects possibly linked to the
accident. She said a better approach would be to track a sample of
residents who lived within a 5-mile radius of the plant at the time
of the accident. She said a similar survey was done the summer
after the accident.
   ``The people in the community are suffering. ... They believe
they have been affected,'' she said.
   The 1985 Health Department study, which was the first of its
kind after the accident, found no pattern of increased cancer cases
or deaths, but it did turn up isolated instances of
higher-than-expected cancer cases in several communities downwind
from the plant. The study dismissed those cases as statistically
insignificant.
   A 1984 survey, conducted door-to-door, found cancer deaths up to
seven times higher than expected in sections of Newberry and
Fairview townships near the plant. The Health Department judged
that invalid because it appeared to focus on streets where cancer
victims lived.
   A 1986 GPU Nuclear Corp. summary of government-sponsored studies
said the 8 millirem average radiation exposure for individuals
within 10 miles of the plant was less than the 10 millirems
generated by a single chest X-ray. The highest possible exposure,
for someone who stood naked at the plant boundary throughout the
accident, would have been less than 100 millirems, said the review
by GPU, the plant's operator.

   The Persian Gulf crisis is occurring in a
region that has become the world's leading destination for
increasingly sophisticated weaponry, from tanks to fighter planes
and ``smart'' missiles.
   The arms that flowed into the area's two leading buyers _ Iraq
and Saudi Arabia _ during the last 15 years are now aimed across
their common border in a dispute that in some ways echoes the
now-diffused Cold War.
   ``Both we and the Soviets thought we were creating allies,
forging relationships on our team in the global bipolar power
struggle,'' said Michael T. Klare, a professor of peace and world
security studies at Hampshire College in Massachusetts.
   ``But that's not what they thought they were doing,'' said
Klare, who wrote a prescient article in May about the emergence of
``regional superpowers'' like Iraq. ``At no point did any of these
countries think they were playing on either team. They have their
own agenda.''
   Saudi Arabia and Iraq received nearly one-third of more than
$300 billion in arms sold to Third World countries from 1982
through 1989, according to a Congressional Research Service
analysis of U.S. intelligence data.
   The United States and the Soviet Union accounted for more than
60 percent of that total weapons trade.
   The soldiers of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carry Soviet
assault weapons and fight with tanks and artillery from Moscow and
Beijing. The fighter planes overhead may come from France or the
Soviet Union. Their multiple-launch rocket systems and some
surface-to-surface missiles are made in Brazil. Still other arms
come from Czechoslovakia, Egypt and South Africa.
   Across the border, the Saudis have F-15 fighters, tanks,
anti-tank missiles and air-to-air missiles from the United States.
The British sold the Saudis fighters, as well; the French provided
anti-aircraft batteries.
   And President Bush has agreed to sell the Saudis another $2.3
billion worth of weapons: more F-14s and tanks, as well as Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles and depleted-uranium anti-armor rounds that
had been banned from Riyadh's shopping list.
   While the superpowers have used arms as a foreign policy tool to
reward allies, the rest of the world has engaged in the trade for
purely commercial reasons.
   Hoping to rid themselves of dependence on the superpowers, Third
World countries have been developing indigenous weapons industries,
defense analysts say. While they once were limited to making small
arms and ammunition, that is no longer the case.
   Brazil can build its own tanks and fighter planes, and is eager
to market them. India builds large warships, artillery and
missiles. Countries from Argentina to South Korea, China and South
Africa also have home-grown weapons capability.
   In 1978-79, the United States and the Soviet Union conducted
talks aimed at clamping controls on the spread of new conventional
weapons technology, but the discussions broke off after the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
   It would be far more difficult for such an effort to be
effective in today's wide-open weapons mart.
   In Iraq, Saddam's domestic weapons industry is among the biggest
worries for U.S. military strategists. Using mercenary Western
expertise, he has been able to improve the range of Soviet-provided
SCUD-B missiles and may have developed chemical warheads for them.
   Saddam also is believed to be well along in developing nuclear
weapons.
   ``It's a tribute to what you can do with money,'' said Janne
Nolan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
group.
   While the United States did not directly arm Iraq, it bears
major responsibility for Saddam's military strength, said Stephanie
Neuman of Columbia University.
   ``We were encouraging it,'' she said, by providing Iraq with
intelligence information during its eight-year war with Iran and
looking the other way while the Soviets and Europeans armed Saddam.
   Klare said Iraq also was quietly permitted to buy U.S. computers
and other high-technology items with defense uses, in part with the
aim of luring the country out of the Soviet orbit.
   Driving the United States was a fear that Iran's Islamic
fundamentalism would grow to dominate the region, and lingering
hatred from the 1970s hostage crisis.
   ``It wasn't a mistake at the time. We had to do it,'' Neuman
said.
   But each U.S. response to a crisis seems to help sow the seeds
of the next crisis where weapons are concerned, analysts said, not
only by selling arms but also through the lingering superpower
lesson that building an arsenal is the way to acquire world
influence.
   ``We're going to have more Iraqs down the road,'' Klare said.
``It may be Brazil, it may be Taiwan, it may be Indonesia. We're
contributing to the emergence of these regional superpowers.''

   Romanian Prime Minister Petre Roman wants to
visit Washington this fall and has been dropping hints to the Bush
administration for an official invitation, The New York Times
reported today.
   ``I want to go because I want to be questioned by the
congressmen and senators. I want to be really there to answer every
question and every criticism directly in the pure American style,''
Roman said in an interview conducted with the Times in Bucharest.
   It is not clear whether the Bush administration, which has
repeatedly criticized the Romanian government, will endorse a visit
by Roman. The prime minister was to meet with Sen. Bob Dole,
Republican minority leader, and six other U.S. representatives
today.
   A U.S. embassy official said the administration was closely
watching how the Romanian government handles anti-government
demonstrations before making a decision.
   The United States has strongly criticized the Romanian
government for its conduct during a June demonstration when a call
for help resulted in miners flooding the capital and beating up
anti-government protesters.

   Archrivals North and South Korea have
set the details for historic talks between their prime ministers,
opening the way for negotiations on easing four decades of
hostilities, officials said today.
   North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk and about 90 others
are scheduled to cross the heavily fortified border on Tuesday for
two days of talks with South Korean officials, the Information
Ministry said.
   Yon is also scheduled to visit with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo, according to government officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   It will be the highest-level contact between the Communist North
and capitalist south since the Korean peninsula was divided in
1945. And security was expected to be tight for the talks, to be
held on Wednesday and Thursday.
   About 3,000 police will ring the hotel where South Korean Prime
Minister Kang Young-hoon and his North Korean counterpart will
meet, the ministry said.
   Thousands more police will be posted around government buildings
and along routes where the delegations are expected to travel,
police said.
   It was agreed that a second round of talks will be held in the
North Korean capital, Pyongyang, on Oct. 16-19, the ministry said.
   Travel plans and other details were completed late Thursday
between officials of the two Koreas meeting in Panmunjom, a border
village inside the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two
nations.
   The North Korean delegation, consisting of eight delegates, 33
assistants and 50 reporters, will walk over the border into the
South at Panmunjom and will be driven the 35 miles to the South
Korean capital.
   The Communist delegation is scheduled to leave South Korea on
Sept. 7.
   Although South Korean officials attach great significance to the
talks, observers doubt substantial progress will be made because
the prime ministers of both nations are mostly figureheads without
policy-making roles.
   North Korea has said the talks should cover mainly ways to ease
political and military tensions. South Korean officials insist
priority be given to non-political exchanges to promote mutual
confidence.
   North Korea has proposed drastic arms reductions, cutting the
troop level to 100,000 each. North Korea has more than 1 million
troops, while South Korea has 650,000.
   The North Koreans also demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. But
South Korea opposes any drastic measures such as arms cuts before
an extended period of confidence-building.
   In an unprecedented move, South Korea proposed an unrestricted
five-day border opening in mid-August for the 62 million residents
of the two Koreas but North Korea failed to meet Seoul officials to
discuss the matter.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist north and
capitalist south in 1945. The nations fought a three-year war in
the early 1950s. Their border is sealed and direct communication
between their peoples is forbidden.

   A 15-year-old boy whose toy rocket
touched off a 7,040-acre blaze has been charged with a misdemeanor
count of recklessly setting a fire, authorities said.
   The youth told officials the rocket malfunctioned July 12 and
crashed into dry brush at Chino Hills State Park. After attempting
to stamp out the flames, the boy called 911. He suffered minor
burns on his lower right leg.
   Model rockets are restricted in certain wilderness areas.
   The Orange County District Attorney's Office filed the charge
Wednesday. Deputy District Attorney David Hickey declined to
identify the youth because of his age.
   Three inmate firefighters were overcome by smoke and a fourth
fractured an elbow in a fall. No structures were damaged in the
blaze, but officials estimated the cost of putting out the fire at
$500,000.
   The park is about 40 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   County fire officials have said they were considering filing a
civil lawsuit against the boy's parents to recover costs. County
Counsel Adrian Kuyper said pursuit of damages and reimbursement for
the cost of extinguishing a fire is standard policy.

   The United States has given up any U.S.
diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict with Iraq and is planning
massive air attacks if economic sanctions fail, a newspaper
reported today.
   ``The administration must now wait to see whether the sanctions
and the diplomatic initiatives work, but obviously, there are other
options,'' Newsday quoted an senior administration official as
saying. The official was not named.
   ``If the sanctions and diplomacy don't work, the U.S. does not
intend to let things stand,'' said a source, identified as having
intimate knowledge of U.S. military thinking. ``In eight to 10
weeks, if Hussein doesn't show a serious willingness to withdraw
from Kuwait, the administration is prepared to make a decision to
use the military to increase the pressure on him to get out.''
   The newspaper said government officials and other knowledgeable
sources believe the timetable for the start of an attack was four
to 10 weeks, depending on military and political factors.
   Administration officials told the newspaper that U.S.-led
military action also depends on allowing enough time to pass for
world onlookers to conclude that economic sanctions imposed against
Iraq were given enough time to take hold. The same is said of peace
initiatives sought by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and Arab leaders, including Jordan's King Hussein.
   Newsday says administration officials apparently believe Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is not serious about an offer to withdraw
his troops from Kuwait in exchange for a lifting of economic
sanctions and other concessions. To date, the United States has
rejected any compromise, insisting on complete withdrawal.

   Air travelers frustrated by delays seized control
of a jetliner and demanded to be flown home, but the plane could
not land because of bad weather, a newspaper reported today.
   The group was stranded for several days at an airport in
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in the Soviet Far East and passengers became
angry when the plane's flight crew went home, Pravda reported. The
travelers, led by a local official, forced a pilot to make the
300-mile flight to the Kuril island of Iturup.
   But when the AN-24 plane approached the Iturup runway, it was
unable to land because of the weather and returned to
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Pravda said. The newspaper also noted that
runways in the region are generally in poor condition.
   The article did not indicate when the incident occurred or
whether the passengers were armed. It also did not say if the
passengers were arrested.
   Pravda said the attempted hijacking was led by Vladimir
Kashpruk, deputy chairman of the Kuril local council.
   Meanwhile, the official Tass news agency reported that pilots
and passengers foiled two separate hijacking attempts in central
Russia on Thursday.
   One involved a drunken passenger with a knife and the other was
a 20-year-old man who grabbed a stewardess and demanded to be flown
to West Germany. Both men were arrested upon landing, Tass said.
   Tass did not give additional details on the incident.

   In a major turnabout,
President F.W. de Klerk called today for the whites-only ruling
National Party to be opened to all races in the drive to end
apartheid.
   De Klerk said the National Party must open its ranks to all
South Africans who shared its basic values and hopes for a
multiracial democracy. He said the party had to prepare for major
changes confronting the country.
   ``The new South Africa demands that those who belong together
through inner conviction should come together,'' he told a party
provincial congress in Durban.
   The opening of the National Party to all races would be a
historic change for the party that created apartheid and attempted
to exclude non-whites from political power. The party has for
decades been the main voice of Afrikaner nationalism, representing
whites of mostly Dutch descent who dominate South African politics.
   The president, who also heads the party, asked the congress to
give party leaders the authority to amend its constitution to admit
all races. The congress was expected to approve, clearing the way
for similar action at other provincial party congresses.
   De Klerk said South Africans of all colors who want a
free-market economy, guaranteed human rights and other protections
must band together to work for their common goals.
   ``The requirement of no (racial) domination means that power has
to be shared in such a way that a majority will neither have
absolute power nor be able to abuse its power to the detriment of
minorities or for their suppression,'' he said.
   De Klerk has pledged to end apartheid and share power with the
black majority. But he wants guarantees on rights for the white
minority under any future black-majority government.
   The government is looking for allies among black political
groups to buttress its position in negotiations with the African
National Congress on sharing power.
   Also today, the government declined to confirm reports that
scores of political prisoners would be released Saturday. The
government and the ANC agreed Aug. 6 on a review process to free
political detainees starting from Sept. 1.
   In a speech earlier today to the congress, Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok warned that black factional fighting which
has claimed more than 500 lives could resume at any time and push
South Africa into a spiral of violence and bloodshed.
   Vlok, who heads the police, also warned that rising crime could
trigger violence between whites and blacks. He said police were
doing all they could to prevent violence.
   Factional fighting in black townships around Johannesburg has
left at least 518 people dead, and Vlok said tension was being
stoked by strikes, black consumer boycotts and terrorist attacks.
   ``These tendencies are unacceptable. In a new South Africa,
South Africans will just have to exercise more tolerance towards
one another,'' Vlok told a provinicial congress of the governing
National Party in Durban.
   Police said today the Johannesburg townships were quiet.
   The violence began Aug. 12 between Xhosas linked to the African
National Congress and Zulus tied to the conservative Inkatha
movement. Fighting raged in the townships for more than two weeks
with rival groups battling with axes, spears, guns and knives.
   The government last week imposed emergency restrictions on the
townships and sent in troops to aid police.
   The ANC, the largest black opposition group, church leaders and
others have accused police of bias during the fighting. Vlok
challenged the ANC and other groups to present evidence to support
the claims. He said if police officers were implicated in fighting
they would be punished.
   Meanwhile, about 500 university students marched today to police
headquaters in Cape Town to protest the recent Johannesburg
fighting. Police made no effort to block the students, who
presented a statement to police commanders charging that police had
sided with Inkatha.
   Police fired shotguns and tear gas Thursday and Wednesday to
break up protests at the University of the Western Cape in Cape
Town when students demonstrated against the violence in
Johannesburg.

<TEXT>
   The commander of U.S. forces in the
Middle East said today there will be no war unless Iraq starts one,
a move he said would be ``an awfully stupid mistake.''
   Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, in his first news conference
since moving his command post to Saudi Arabia, repeatedly ducked
questions about specific U.S. military options under consideration.
But he said the United States was not looking to start hostilities.
   ``There's not going to be any war unless the Iraqis attack,''
Schwarzkopf told reporters after spending the day visiting American
troops in northeast Saudi Arabia.
   Schwarzkopf called the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ``not
only a mugging but a rape.'' He said said Iraqi forces in Iraq and
Kuwait appeared to be in defensive posture but were capable of
taking the offense.
   ``They certainly have the capability to attack, although I think
if they were to do so it would be an awful stupid mistake,''
Schwarzkopf said.
   The general glanced at the floor before answering a question
about how much impact Iraq's holding of American and other Western
hostages had on his military planning.
   ``I would tell you that obviously I am just as concerned as
anyone else about every single human life,'' Schwarzkopf said. But,
he added: ``What I have to do is plan the military component and
not concern myself with the hostages.''
   He refused to answer a question about whether his early
declaration about war prospects meant that the United States would
not make an offensive push to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   He also refused to say whether the military was aiding the
Kuwaiti resistance. There have been reports that Army special
operations forces are helping the resistance movement.
   There has been speculation that the United States would seek a
permanent military foothold in Saudi Arabia regardless of the
outcome of the current staandoff _ a delicate subject because of
anti-American sentiment in parts of the Arab world.
   When asked about such prospects, Schwarzkopf said: ``We have no
intention of establishing a permanent base in Saudi Arabia.''
   Schwarzkopf laughed when asked who was in charge of the
multinational forces.
   ``This is not NATO,'' he said. ``This is not a single command
and there doesn't need to be.''
   The United States has by far the biggest military presence in
Saudi Arabia and many nations that have committed forces to the
region have not yet sent them, or sent only small contingents.
   Asked by a French reporter if France should send more forces,
Scwarzkopf said only: ``I would like all the help I can get.''
   Schwarzkopf is a bear of a man and can be gruff at times. But he
was grandfatherly during stops at several U.S. staging areas,
filling the troops in on the latest developments in the crisis and
promising them more newspapers and radios.
   After a briefing by commanders of the 101st Airborne Division's
air assault brigade, Schwarzkopf walked into a garage area and
immediately encountered Staff Sgt. John Frady, of Sylva, N.C., a
member of a maintenance platoon who was in the process of receiving
a haircut.
   The general asked him: ``Ready to do the job?''
   Frady answered: ``Ready to go to war, sir.''
   He next visited the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing from Myrtle
Beach, S.C., telling them the arrival of the wing's A-10
tank-killers had made him more confident of the deterrent power of
the U.S. deployment.
   He said the United States was there to defend Saudi Arabia but
ready to fight back if Saddam Hussein ordered Iraqi forces to
invade the kingdom.
   ``Let's face it, if he dares come across that border and comes
down here, I'm completely confident that we're going to kick his
butt when he gets here,'' Schwarzkopf said.
   Speaking to a group of officers in an air-conditioned tent at
the same airstrip, Schwarzkopf said.
   ``Every now and then people have to go to war and ask themselves
whether they are on the right side or the wrong side. There is no
doubt that we are on the right side now, because the whole world is
telling us that.''
   His next and last stop was a Marine support camp in northeast
Saudi Arabia, where Schwarzkopf received yet another briefing and
visited with Marines digging a sandbag-lined foxhole.
   ``Our attitude has to be to be in this for the long haul,''
Schwarzkopf told a small group of Marines who had asked him about
the latest developments in the crisis.
   One Marine said he had heard a rumor about the C-5 crash in
Germany this week.
   Schwarzkopf told the group the transport indeed had crashed,
killing 13 people. As the Marines shook their heads, Schwarzkopf
said: ``That's 13 more counts against Saddam Hussein.''

   Government and Mohawk work crews today
further dismantled a series of barricades around a heavily traveled
bridge, but other Indian roadblocks nearby remained intact.
   The destruction of the five barrier sites near the Mercier
Bridge and Kahnawake reservation resumed despite a breakdown of
talks between provincial officials and Mohawks concerning the
seven-week standoff.
   The bridge, a principal link between Montreal and suburbs, was
blocked by Mohawks at the reservation in sympathy with the Indians
in Oka, who objected to a proposed golf course expansion on land
they consider ancestral.
   The conflict began July 11 when the Quebec provincial police
stormed a Mohawk barricade in Oka, about 18 miles west of Montreal.
The police were repulsed and one officer was killed, but it is
still not clear who shot him.
   Canadian Forces Capt. Richard St-Louis said today that work
crews had not yet reached the Mercier Bridge.
   ``We don't have any timetable to get on the bridge. We are
moving day by day,'' he said.
   Premier Robert Bourassa issued a terse statement late Thursday
saying he was going back to the original plan of using the army to
dismantle barricades.
   ``The government of Quebec maintains its position concerning the
intervention of the army, announced last Monday,'' Bourassa said.
   He said he was withdrawing from talks because negotiators for
the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy had announced they were
pulling out.
   Last-ditch talks between Mohawks and government officials this
week included delegates from the confederacy, the highest-ranking
traditional leadership of the Iroquois, which includes the Mohawks.
   ``Dismantling barricades is our mandate. We are to act on our
own as we see fit. Our mandate has no limit,'' said an army
spokesman, Capt. Yvon Desjardins.
   Mohawk Chief Joe Norton alleged ``harassment'' and said
shipments of food and medicine were being blocked from entering the
Kahnawake reserve by angry residents and police.
   Chief Billy Two Rivers said Mohawks have been asked to give up
too much.
   ``Maybe some of the white people didn't see Indian blood, but
unfortunately we can't give them everything,'' he said.
   Quebec provincial police and an army spokesmen denied the
charges of harassment or that food into the reservation was blocked.
   ``I can categorically state that no food is being kept out of
Kahnawake whatsoever,'' said Army Capt. Donald Roy.
   The dispute has touched off an anti-Indian backlash among
residents angered by the barricades.
   Most of Kanesatake's 1,500 residents have left as a result of
the confrontation. An estimated 200 to 300 remain.

   Mayor Marion Barry may face another trial,
this time in the Virgin Islands, on the remaining counts of his
federal drug indictment, a Washington television station reports.
   Judy Smith, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Washington, declined to comment on the report Thursday by WRC-TV.
   But law enforcement sources told The Associated Press that the
prosecutors had discussed the possibility of bringing a case
against Barry in the Virgin Islands, where some of the alleged
offenses took place.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said no
decision has been made on whether to proceed.
   In the Virgin Islands Thursday, a federal judge sentenced a
figure in the Barry case to probation and community service for his
conviction on drug charges.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens has until Sept. 17 to decide whether
to try Barry again on the 12 counts on which a District of Columbia
jury failed to agree Aug. 10.
   That jury acquitted Barry on one misdemeanor count of cocaine
possession and convicted him on a similar count. The judge declared
a mistrial on the remaining counts _ three felony perjury counts
and nine misdemeanor possession or conspiracy counts.
   Former city government employee Charles Lewis was a key witness
against the mayor.
   Lewis, 50, a former Virgin Islands government employee, could
have received a maximum 80-year prison term on his Virgin Islands
conviction in April 1989 for possessing and selling crack cocaine.
   Instead, U.S. District Judge Stanley Brotman sentenced Lewis on
Thursday to five years of probation during which he must perform
1,000 hours of community service and undergo periodic tests for
drug use.
   The judge said Lewis had extensively cooperated with the Barry
investigation.
   The U.S. attorney's office began to build its case against Barry
in December 1988 after District of Columbia police called off an
attempt to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis after finding
that the mayor was in Lewis' hotel room.

   Rebels have killed about 200
foreigners in Liberia whose governments contributed soldiers to a
West African force sent to end the nation's civil war, the Ghana
News Agency reported today.
   The news agency, which has a reporter with the West African
force, quoted witnesses as saying the civilians, including many
Ghanaians and Nigerians, were killed after the military force
landed in Monrovia, Liberia's main port.
   The agency quoted unidentified Ghanaians who said they had
escaped the attack by guerrillas loyal to rebel leader Charles
Taylor, who has vehemently opposed intervention by the West African
force.
   About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Gambia arrived in Monrovia on Aug. 25 on troop transport ships
under orders to end the eight-month tribal war in Liberia. The
report suggested that the killings occurred after the force landed
in Liberia but did not give a specific date.
   Taylor's fighters have attacked the force on several occasions.
   The news agency quoted Kweku Egyir, 52, a Ghanaian who has lived
in Liberia since 1963, as saying Taylor's men were singling out
Ghanaians and Nigerians because their countries' soldiers have
inflicted many casualties on the rebels.
   Egyir was quoted as saying the rebels were able to identify the
Ghanaians and Nigerias by their their accents and tribal scars.
``The marks on our faces are called identity cards in this
country,'' he said.
   No other information was available on the reported civilian
killings, and they could not immediately be independently verified.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz met privately today
but reported no immediate progress in defusing the explosive
Persian Gulf crisis.
   They met for two hours at midday, then after a short break
opened a second round of talks attended by their aides.
   ``I met with my friend, Tariq Aziz, and we discussed the present
crisis,'' Perez de Cuellar told reporters at the end of the first
session.
   Aziz, who stood next to the secretary-general, said he was happy
``to meet an old friend and we have confidence in him.'' He said
they would provide details of their talks after the second round.
   The two officials know each other well from meetings during
negotiations for a formal peace treaty at the end of the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war.
   A senior Jordanian official, who had met with the U.N. chief
before the talks with Aziz began, said there was a ``strong
possibility'' that Perez de Cuellar will travel to Baghdad for
talks on a settlement of the crisis.
   No such decision has been made, the official said. But the U.N.
chief was prepared to fly to the Iraqi capital to meet President
Saddam Hussein if the talks with Aziz fail to produce any
significant progress.
   Aziz declared on arrival at Amman's airport that Iraq ``will
achieve victory despite the international conspiracy against it.''
   His defiant statement contrasted with the hopeful comments by
the U.N. chief on his arrival the previous day. Perez de Cuellar
said he believed ``Iraq is as eager as we all are to find a just
and lasting solution of the problem.
   ``I can't understand anyone in the world prepared to sacrifice
human lives,'' Perez de Cuellar said Thursday.
   In his arrival statement, Aziz said: ``Our struggle is a
historic one and we have all undertaken it in honesty and
manliness. Victory will be ours and the Arab nation's, God
willing.''
   He added said he would discuss ``all gulf issues'' with the U.N.
official and that he was ``optimistic about the future of the Arab
nation.''
   Aziz also said Iraqi authorities will ``allow all Western women
and children to leave Iraq as of Saturday.''
   Saddam had announced on Tuesday that Western women and children
held hostage in Iraq to fend off a potential U.S. attack could
leave the country, but only a few have since been granted the
necessary exit permits.
   When he arrived at Amman airport, Perez de Cuellar told
reporters ``I am not a merchant to negotiate. I came here to
discuss ways and means of finding a solution to the problem.''
   He reiterated earlier statements that he was not in a position
to ``make concessions'' on the requirement that Iraq implementat
resolutions approved by the Security Council after the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. ``These are not my resolutions...I cannot make
any concessions on these,'' he said.
   The resolutions demand that Iraq unconditionally withdraw from
Kuwait and restore the deposed royal family.
   He welcomed as a ``good step'' Saddam's decision Tuesday to
allow foreign women and children among those held hostage in Iraq
to leave.
   Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait in a dispute over oil, land and
money, then annexed the fallen kingdom. The invasion and the
movement of Iraqi troops close to the Saudi Arabian border prompted
the creation of a U.S-led multinational force to protect the
kingdom against further Iraqi expansion.

   Hurricane Gustav was over the Atlantic this morning
with wind blowing at up to 110 mph but appeared certain to bypass
Bermuda, the only land threatened by the storm system since last
weekend, forcecasters said.
   ``We're expecting (Gustav) to take a turn towards the
northeast'' during the day today, missing Bermuda altogether, said
Daniel Petersen, hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane
Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Gustav, which weakened to 80 mph Wednesday, gained strength
steadily since, but some decrease in strength was expected today,
he said.
   At noon EDT, the hurricane's center was located near latitude
32.8 degrees north and longitude 56.8 west, or about 485 miles east
of Bermuda. It was moving north at 18 mph.
   A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74 mph or
more. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.

   Rebels have killed about 200
foreigners in Liberia whose governments contributed soldiers to a
West African force sent to end the nation's civil war, the Ghana
News Agency reported today.
   The news agency, which has a reporter with the five-nation
force, quoted witnesses as saying the civilians, including many
Ghanaians and Nigerians, were killed after the military contingent
landed in Monrovia, Liberia's main port.
   The agency quoted unidentified Ghanaians who said they escaped
the attack by guerrillas loyal to rebel leader Charles Taylor, who
has vehemently opposed intervention by the West African force.
   About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Gambia arrived in Monrovia on Aug. 25 on troop transport ships
under orders to end the eight-month tribal war.
   Taylor's fighters have attacked the force on several occasions.
   The news agency quoted a 36-year-old Ghanaian teacher, Kwasi
Kwateng, as saying rebels attacked a community of 2,500 Ghanaians
in Barnesville, about three miles from Monrovia's port.
   But it was not immediately clear how many caity of the 5,000 people
estimated to have died in the
war have been civilians.
   Diplomatic sources said today that the five-nation force seized
control of Monrovia's major airfield and began to advance toward
three beseiged embassies. The capture of the Spriggs Payne Airfield
could allow flights of supplies and additional troops for the
contingent, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Soldiers at the airport today were trying to reach the Ghana,
Nigeria and Guinea embassies on the city's outskirts in territory
held by Taylor's men, said sources in touch with the regional
forces by radio.
   Taylor claims his forces hold several thousand citizens of
countries participating in the military force.
   ``What we are we doing right now is not unlike what other
countries have had to do to protect the lives of citizens of
countries involved in wars with other countries,'' Taylor told the
British Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday in a telephone interview
from Liberia.
   The rebel leader said his fighters have evacuated several
thousand people from front-line areas to stop ``angry mobs of
Liberians from killing them. It is for their security and for our
security.''
   U.S. Marines based on warships off Liberia have evacuated
Americans and other foreigners from Monrovia and have deployed
around the U.S. Embassy. However, U.S. forces have refused to
intervene in the fighting.
   Meanwhile, a conference of opposition groups, churchmen and
business leaders, meeting in Banjul, Gambia, was expected to make a
recommendation on who should head any interim government, pending
new elections.
   Leaders of the five-nation military force have said an interim
government would be installed as soon as fighting ended.
   Taylor's forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast in December
and advanced largely unchecked until they reached the outskirts of
Monrovia. They have been unable to dislodge troops loyal to Doe.
Johnson's rebels, who split with Taylor, have taken control of much
of the capital.
   Johnson and Doe have agreed to a truce, and both support efforts
to end the war. It is unclear what role Doe would play in an
interim government.

<TEXT>
   German leaders met in a palace of German
princes today and signed a treaty meant to reconcile the stark
differences between their two nations just 33 days before they
become one.
   The document was signed by West German Interior Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble and East Germany's top unity negotiator,
Guenther Krause.
   Earlier, the cabinets of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere formally approved the
pact.
   The treaty is the final blueprint for the framework of a united
nation, although it leaves many crucial issues to be decided by a
united German government.
   ``Today we are fulfilling one of the last remaining hurdles to
German unification,'' de Maiziere said moments before the pact was
signed in a 17th century palace in East Berlin.
   The sweeping accord preserves East Germany's liberal abortion
law, calls for a united Berlin to be the capital of the new nation,
and guarantees some social programs for jobless East Germans.
   It gives Western investors first claim to East German property,
a major development that economists say is necessary to revive the
nation's shattered economy.
   The pact also allows East Germany to maintain some control over
the 6 million files of the former Communist secret police, a
potentially explosive compilation of sinister secrets from the
nation's dark past.
   Overall, the treaty reconciles fundamental legal and political
differences between two nations that followed vastly different
paths after they were carved from the conquered Nazi empire.
   The signing ceremony was held in the stately Berlin Palace, the
home of German crown princes who laid the foundation for the
Prussian empire of the 18th century. Like Germany, the palace was
destroyed during World War II and then rebuilt.
   The signing took place on the eve of 51st anniversary of World
War II. On Sept. 1, 1939, Hitler's forces invaded Poland, and
France and England declared the war that eventually split Germany.
   The German states will become one on Oct. 3, when East Germany's
Parliament invokes a clause that will allow it to accede to the
larger nation.
   Germans in both territories will then elect a common government
on Dec. 2.
   That impending election date has created an enormous campaign
battle between Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats and his main
rival in the elections, the left-leaning Social Democrats.
   Key aspects of the treaty _ particularly the sharp differences
between East Germany's liberal abortion law and West Germany's
tough one _ were held up by debate that threatened the pact's
passage.
   Although such a treaty was not necessary for German unification,
failure to approve it would have meant that West German laws would
have become automatically the law of a greater German land.
   The treaty was considered an important psychological necessity
for an East German nation that has been buffeted by enormous
political and economic change in less than a year, and which is
about to lose its sovereignty and its identity.
   The treaty is a companion piece to the economic pact that merged
the currencies and economies of the German states on July 1, when
East Germany formally became a free market after four decades of
socialism.
   East German joblessness since then has skyrocketed as factories
collapse in the face of Western competition.
   The document includes an important provision for the
distribution of East German property.
   Tens of thousands of West Germans who fled what is now East
Germany after the Soviet invasion of World War II have filed claims
on their former property. A prolonged process is planned to
determine the validity of those claims on an individual basis.
   The uncertainty of those many claims _ and who will be the
potential owner of much East German property _ has been blamed for
inhibiting Western investment needed to provide jobs and replace
the dying sectors of the East German economy.
   Under a previous agreement, West Germans are allowed to claim
property in East Germany that was seized from their families by the
Communists or lost when they fled to the West. Under the treaty
signed today, anyone who buys land in East Germany for development
purposes is protected from claims by previous owners or their
heirs. There will be a system worked out later to compensate people
who don't get their land back because it is being developed
commercially or because their claim would displace people living
there.
   The pact also includes a compromise on the volatile abortion
question. East Germany's permissive law will remain in effect until
a new German government passes a law for both nations in 1992.
   It also settles, at least for now, a dispute between the two
Germanys over the disposition of the files compiled by the
notorious secret police, which kept sensitive information about
millions of people, some of them now leaders in the democratic
government.
   East Germany and West Germany both wanted control of the files,
a gold mine of espionage and terrorist intelligence. Under the
compromise, the united Parliament will make the decision.
   In the meantime, the files will temporarily remain in what is
now East Germany under the custody of a West German official to be
chosen by East Germany.

<TEXT>
   The typical American family's ability to buy a
house fell slightly in July and is expected to drop substantially
in August because of rising mortgage rates linked to the Persian
Gulf crisis, a real estate trade group said Friday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its housing
affordability index declined from 102.9 in June to 102.3 last
month. That means a family with a median income of $34,358 had
102.3 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing
home costing $98,400.
   The median income was $34,250 in June, while the median price
was $97,500.
   The median means half of the families earn more and half earn
less, or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less.
   However, Realtors President Norman D. Flynn said mortgage rate
increases resulting from developments in the Middle East will cause
a substantial loss in housing affordability in August.
   ``Home buyers in America will get hit by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait,'' he said. ``First-time buyers will get hit hardest.
Unfortunately, entry-level buyers who might have just qualified to
purchase a home in June or July may now find themselves priced out
of the market.''
   Although the median price rose $900 in July, the index decline
was offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate the
index and the $108 gain in median family income.
   The rate, a composite of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate
mortgages, edged down from 10.16 percent to 10.15 percent in July.
   The changes resulted in a $6 increase in the monthly mortgage
payment, to $700.
   The July median income exceeded the $33,579 needed to qualify
for a median-priced home. A family earning that amount actually
would qualify to buy a home priced at $100,500 using conventional
financing covering 80 percent of the cost.
   Under July's affordability conditions, a family earning $20,000
would have sufficient income to qualify for a $58,500 home using a
$46,800 loan. A family earning $30,000 would qualify for an $87,800
home with an 80 percent loan.
   A family earning $40,000 would have sufficient income for a
$117,000 home and a family with $50,000 income would qualify for a
$146,300 home.

   A committee to award a Polish peace prize
has established an office with Solidarity leader and Nobel Peace
prize winner Lech Walesa as its chairman.
   ``In reference to the Polish tradition of tolerance, reflected
in Solidarity's ethics, and in view of the contemporary threats
stemming from nationalism and chauvinism, we are establishing a
Polish Peace Prize,'' Walesa's committee said in a statement.
   The statement apparently referred to a recent surfacing of
nationalism and anti-Semitism in Europe.
   The Polish Peace Committee will be based in Lublin, in
southeastern Poland. It is composed of two groups: the first,
headed by former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski, will promote protection of religious and ethnic peace
and the other, headed by Nobel Literature laureate Czeslaw Milosz,
will foster efforts to achieve unity in Europe.

   An obscure group of Slavic-speakers
who escaped centuries of repression in their forested homeland have
earned a special place in the German unification treaty signed
Friday.
   The Sorbs, who number about 100,000 and live in East Germany's
Spree Forest, asked for legal protection of their unique culture
and got it.
   ``The preservation and continuation of Sorb culture and of Sorb
traditions will be guaranteed. Members of the Sorb people have the
freedom to preserve their language in public life,'' states one
part of the treaty.
   The Sorbs are native residents of a remote swath of East Germany
stretching 56 miles north of the Czechoslovak border. Centuries ago
their marshy, wooded homeland was called Lusatia.
   They are colorful in customs and in dress. The traditional way
for Sorbs to get to their fields or visit neighboring villages is
in long, thin wooden boats that are pushed with a pole along small
waterways crisscrossing the Spree Forest.
   Many Sorbs are farmers, but eel-fishing is also a customary
livelihood.
   The Sorbs withstood German invasions in the sixth, eighth, 10th
and 12th centuries. Ultimately, German invaders swallowed up their
homeland, but not their customs until Adolf Hitler ordered their
language not be spoken.
   East Germany's Communist rulers generally allowed the Sorbs to
preserve their ways and actually helped the Sorb culture thrive by
virtually sealing off much of East Germany from Western influences.
   Now, with East Germany opened up to the outside world and
Westerners flooding in, the Sorbs worry their unique traditions
could be endangered.

   A prosecutor out in a Catholic environment and being
part of our religious education curriculum we can assist Sarabeth
in forming her conscience according to Catholic teaching. That's
what we're all about,'' Ms. Doyle said.
   Ms. Eason drew the attention of Catholic officials four years
ago after she was interviewed on television about her opinion of
parental notification when a teen-ager seeks an abortion. Her name
also appeared in a local newspaper advertisement supporting the
1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
   She was about to enter the sixth grade when the Rev. Richard
Miller told Mrs. Eason the girl would have to write a letter
renouncing her views on abortion or be expelled.
   Ms. Eason refused and was expelled. She enrolled in Maumee
Valley County Day School, a private, non-sectarian institution.
   Mrs. Eason said she sent her daughter to the Catholic school
because she could no longer afford to send her to Maumee Valley and
preferred not to send her to a public school.

   Iraq said today it was sending more foreign
men to potential military targets and linked the release of some
Western women and children to the return of Iraqis stranded outside
the country.
   Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said more than 200
foreigners were waiting to leave for London and Paris on Iraq
Airways. He said Iraq wanted the same planes used to bring back an
unspecified number of Iraqis stranded in the two capitals by the
``brutal Amercican sanctions.''
   ``This is a humanitarian request, and we hope the two
governments will reply quickly and positively,'' al-Hadithi said at
a news conference.
   Later, al-Hadithi said meeting the request was not a
precondition to Iraq's allowing foreign women and children to leave
the country. But if it is not met, he said, they might have to
leave by land.
   Britain's Foreign Office said it would have no objection to
Iraqis returning to Baghdad aboard the flights.
   ``We would have no objection to that. If a plane is coming out
here with British nationals on it, and is going back to empty to
Baghdad, Iraqi nationals want to go on it, of course they can go,''
a Foreign Office spokesman said.
   ``We do not have hostages. Any Iraqi in this country is free to
leave,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Al-Hadithi said the foreign women and children now awaiting
departure include 123 Britons, 66 Japanese, 19 French, 14
Americans, two Australians and four of unspecified nationalities.
   He said an unspecified number of women and children from other
countries that he did not name were ``in principle'' free to leave
immediately. He said their governments had to make arrangements for
their departure.
   However, he said the foreign men still held in Iraq have been
taken to potential military targets all over the country.
   ``Every place, every town that has a vital installation will
host our guests,'' he said. ``We're relocating the foreign men all
over the country at airports, air bases, military bases, industrial
plants, communications centers, power centers and oil refineries _
wherever Iraq considers it has a vital installation, one exposed to
the American threat in Saudi Arabia.''
   The spokesman did not say how many foreigners were being taken
to installations.
   Earlier today, a few foreigners were able to leave Iraq.
   Nineteen Italians arrived safely in Jordan, and the Finnish
Foreign Ministry said today that three Finnish women left Iraq for
Turkey. In Athens, a government spokesman said five Greek women and
children were expected to leave Iraq on a flight from Baghdad.
   Sweden's Foreign Ministry said today that the 50 Swedish women
and children stranded in Iraq have received exit permits and may
leave Baghdad on Saturday. Spokeswoman Anita Matejovsky said
citizens from Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland might travel
with the Swedish group in a Nordic airlift.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's announcement Tuesday said the
women and children would be allowed to leave starting Wednesday.
Western governments complained Thursday that an undue amount of
paperwork was required for the exit visas.
   There was no immediate word on the hundreds of American women
and children waiting to leave. Margaret Tutwiler, a State
Department spokesman, said there are about 500 American women in
Kuwait as well as 410 children under age 18. She indicated the
number of women and children in Iraq is less than 100.
   Italian Ambassador Franco Dacourtan said the 13 Italian women
and six children were in good health and would be flown to Rome on
Saturday.
   The Italian group made a seven-hour road journey across the
Iraqi desert to the Jordanian border outpost of Ruweishid, and then
continued on to Amman, 150 miles to the southwest.
   About 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans, were in
Kuwait when Iraq invaded on Aug. 2. An unknown number escaped,
mostly into Saudi Arabia. But some others were taken to Baghdad,
and Saddam threatened to use them as human shields to protect Iraqi
installations against possible attack.
   The Baghdad government said 28 foreign ``guests'' had opted to
stay. Diplomats in the Iraqi capital said they were mostly those
with government contracts or businesses in Iraq.

   Police have taken to escorting garbage
trucks in the Naples area because of what they say appears to be a
Mafia-style campaign to intimidate private collectors into paying
protection money.
   Officials in the anti-terrorist police squad in Naples said
Friday they were investigating a string of attacks to see if they
are linked to the Camorra, a crime syndicate based in the Naples
area that is compared to the Sicilian Mafia.
   On Thursday, two hooded youths on a motorcycle stopped a garbage
truck at gunpoint in Portici, a township on the outskirts of Naples.
   The youths forced the driver and his partner to leave the truck
and shot eight times at it, damaging the windshield and hood. They
youths sped away, shouting threats at the trash collecting company.
   Recent attacks on trash collection firms include an armed
robbery of two garbage men on duty and the shooting at another
truck.
   A Naples magistrate has been investigating how the city awards
contracts to trash collectors to see if the Camorra has influenced
contract bidding.

   A proposed $40 million women's health center
will be named after an Akron native who died in the 1986 explosion
of the space shuttle Challenger, builders said.
   The Judith A. Resnik Women's Health Center will provide services
such as radiation therapy, gynecological examinations and in-vitro
fertilization to women of all ages, said Trudy Kapper, spokeswoman
for the Summa Corp., which will build the center.
   Ms. Resnik, the second woman astronaut in the space program, was
an outstanding student and had a biomedical fellowship at the
National Institutes of Health, Ms. Kapper said Friday. ``If you
look at her history and values, she strove for excellence.''
   The center, to be built next to Akron's St. Thomas Medical
Center, is part of a $79 million expansion and renovation project
announced this month by Summa, a holding company created by the
hospital.

   Edmund G. Love, a novelist and author of the
book on which the Broadway musical ``Subways Are for Sleeping'' was
based, has died. He was 78.
   Love died Thursday at St. Joseph Hospital after suffering a
heart attack at his Flint apartment.
   He published about 20 books, and his writings appeared in many
anthologies and textbooks on writing.
   ``Subways Are For Sleeping'' was adapted from Love's 1957 book
of the same title about experiences sleeping on New York subway
trains when he couldn't afford lodging.
   Love also was known for ``The Situation in Flushing,'' a 1965
book about a boy's love of trains in the early 1900s. The book was
excerpted in The Saturday Evening Post.
   ``Hanging On,'' about how his family survived the Depression in
Flint, has been used in University of Michigan classes on American
history.
   One of his stories inspired the feature film ``Destination:
Gobi.''
   After Army service during World War II, Love headed a team that
wrote military histories of the war in the Pacific Theater and then
became a freelance writer.
   Survivors include his wife, Ann; a son and four grandchildren.
   Mrs. Love said her husband didn't want a funeral. Burial
arrangements were incomplete.

   RHEIN-MAIN AIR BASE, West Germany (AP) _ Somewhere out there is
a woman named Kathy who has an important question to answer. And
somewhere, probably in Saudia Arabia, there's a U.S. soldier hoping
it will be yes.
   But a postcard with the question for Kathy is stuck at
Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany. The soldier, whose name
appears to be Chris, had to rush away just he was scribbling her a
proposal, Stars and Stripes newspaper said Friday.
   ``He slapped a stamp on the postcard, handed it to a woman
working at the store where he bought it and asked her to mail it
for him,'' the newspaper said.
   Then he ran away. He was gone before the woman could tell him
there was no address on the card. Just a message that said:
   ``Hello, sweetheart! I love you!
   ``Just a little note to say howdy and let you know I'm OK. So,
now you know one of the spots I stopped at on my way to this little
adventure.
   ``How about getting engaged when I get home? I'm serious and
I'll write more later. Take care!''
   Then he wrote ``I love you'' again, scratched his name on the
card and scurried to catch his flight.
   ``Kathy, we think you should say yes,'' Stars and Stripes wrote.

   The World Book Encyclopedia devotes six pages to
the topic of salesmanship, but the company's sales force devote
their lives.
   About 2,000 World Book sellers are in town this week, hearing
pep talks on how to move the weighty volumes and trying to dispel
some myths about the image of door-to-door salespeople.
   ``They don't consider themselves salespeople, though they are
some of the most dynamic salespeople anywhere,'' Vito Mazza, a
World Book salesman from New York City, said during a break
Thursday at the company's annual conference.
   ``They consider themselves educators, counselors. And perception
is reality.''
   Mazza said he knows firsthand the misconceptions about his
profession. When he started with World Book 17 years ago, Mazza
said, his job choice made his father uncomfortable.
   ``My father would tell people, `He's going to be a teacher _ but
he's selling World Book encyclopedias right now,''' Mazza said.
   Though they occasionally have to battle the stereotype of the
high-pressure door-to-door salesman, the World Book sellers, who
call themselves ``World Bookers,'' appear to have no problem with
self-image.
   Their four-day meeting, which concludes Saturday, is a mix of
feel-good speeches, award presentations and sales tips that hammer
home the idea that these people are not just selling books _
they're contributing to the education of the world.
   They also enjoy themselves.
   Diana Bauer, a Baltimore resident who has sold World Books for
12 years, said she enjoys door-to-door selling, known in the trade
as ``cold calling.''
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' Ms. Bauer said. ``You don't know who's on
the other side of that door. It's a wonderful opportunity to
practice your craft.''

   He remembers leaving the bar.
   He remembers drinking the six tequila slammers and any number of
rum colas.
   But he doesn't have a clue as to how he got mashed in with a ton
of trash in the back of a garbage truck.
   ``I'm not sure if I put myself in there or if I was put in
there,'' the unidentified, 26-year-old man told the Grand Rapids
Press on Thursday, apparently after passing the night in the
garbage truck.
   Don Kraai, who drives the truck for Pete's Disposal Inc.,
discovered his passenger during his rounds on the morning after the
night before. He became disconcerted when he heard a knocking sound
in the trash compartment.
   ``I pounded the truck and it banged back at me,'' Kraai said.
   After calling a dispatcher, Kraai began emptying the truck by
hand and found the moaning man.
   ``He was just mixed in there with bags of trash,'' Kraai said.
``It looked kind of weird.''
   Thomas Boss, a fire department battalion chief, said the man
likely would have been killed had he crawled into a larger truck,
where the packing mechanism is more powerful.
   Peter Edema, owner of Pete's Disposal, said it was a good thing
Kraai heard the man when he did. ``Otherwise, he'd be in the
incinerator.''
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' the man said. He said he'd
been awake for about 30 minutes before his rescue, but was unable
to get the driver's attention. ``I have bumps and bruises, but I'm
lucky to be alive.''
   After firefighters arrived, the man was taken to Blodgett
Memorial Medical Center, where he was treated and discharged.

   President Bush today lobbied allies
to help pick up the tab for the Persian Gulf buildup, making phone
calls to leaders of Saudi Arabia, Britain and France. Sources said
some allies and congressmen were pressuring the White House to move
militarily against Saddam Hussein.
   These administration sources said the pressure for a military
move was building from various quarters, which they declined to
identify beyond describing them as allies and members of Congress.
But they said the pressure by no means constituted a consensus.
   The sources said Bush continued to weigh all options, but at
this point there was no clearcut case to be made for a U.S. attack
in the absence of a new provocation. The sources spoke on condition
they not be identified.
   The administration refused to comment publicly on prospects for
military action. Meanwhile, the U.S. military presence in the
waters surrounding Iraq and on the ground in Saudi Arabia grows
daily.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk dismissed news reports
suggesting growing pressure for a military strike as ``uninformed
speculation.''
   Bush spoke to Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand in a
series of morning phone calls, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in a statement.
   ``All the leaders agreed to stay in close communication
regarding each other's efforts in the Persian Gulf,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The president is seeking international donations to help pay for
preparations for a possible war in the gulf with a
``burdensharing'' plan he announced on Thursday.
   ``All the leaders emphasized the need for continued cooperative
efforts to maintain the international community's steadfast stand
against the Iraqi aggression in Kuwait,'' the written White House
statement said.
   The Washington Times today quoted sources as saying some U.S.
allies fear that anything less than crushing Iraqi military forces
would leave Baghdad's conventional, chemical and nuclear weapons
intact and would put Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf nations at
Iraq's mercy once U.S. and other foreign troops are withdrawn.
   ``There is no doubt that the Saudis and the Israelis fear that
the United States will accept a deal that leaves a wounded rather
than a defeated tiger in place in Baghdad,'' the newspaper said it
was told by a ``well-placed'' U.S. source.
   The Times quoted its sources as saying Turkey, the exiled
Kuwaiti government, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and
Oman were among the nations urging the United States to use force
to resolve the crisis.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy said today the United States should not
depend on other countries to pay for its massive military
deployment but should consider higher taxes instead.
   ``I don't want to leave any impression in the world that we pay
for our soldiers and our sailors, if we send them into another part
of the world, only through another country's money,'' the Vermont
Democrat said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``This is not a rent
military. It's not a mercenary force.''
   Separate House and Senate delegations left Andrews Air Force
Base today for five-day visits to the troubled region. Both groups
planned to meet with U.S. troops and their commanders and with
government leaders in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
   The United States wants to try to raise enough money to cover
the $1-billion-per-month cost of the U.S. military buildup in the
region, an administration official said.
   ``It is important that the considerable burden of the effort be
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free
flow of oil,'' Bush said.
   Bush announced that he is seeking money for Egypt, Turkey and
Jordan _ which are suffering severe economic effects from the trade
embargo with Iraq and from a flood of refugees _ while also
soliciting contributions for U.S. military costs.
   Bush also talked by phone with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, United Arab Emirates
President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Turkish President
Turgut Ozal and the Kuwaiti emir, Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said
Fitzwater.
   The calls were intended to coordinate the countries' efforts as
Bush prepares to dispatch Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other officials to the
Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia. They are to work on signing up U.S.
friends for what Bush called an ``action plan'' to round up
financial aid.
   Brady will leave next week on a trip which will take him to
London, Paris, Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo, according to an
administration source who spoke on condition that he not be named.
   The source said that Brady's schedule called for him to meet
with officials from Europe to the Far East within a five-day time
period, returning to Washington by Sept. 8.
   Japan announced Thursday that it would contribute $1 billion in
assistance, and some other countries have indicated a willingness
to make donations.
   Leahy said the U.S. could pay for its role in the Persian Gulf
crisis in one of three ways: by adding the cost to the
ever-expanding budget deficit, by cutting other programs, or by
``paying as you go,'' the method the lawmaker said he preferred.
   ``I don't like to vote for taxes ... but I think we ought to be
honest about what we're doing,'' he said.
   Twenty-two countries are involved in the military effort against
Iraq.
   About 60,000 U.S. combat troops have moved to battle stations in
the gulf in the past three weeks and their number is expected to
reach 100,000 soon.
   Bush told reporters n Washington that his analysts have a hard
time determining whether the standoff with Saddam Hussein over the
Iraqi president's invasion of Kuwait will end up in a shooting war.
   ``It's so hard to answer that question because of the
unpredictable nature of Saddam Hussein himself,'' Bush said at a
White House news conference.

   Hundreds of Moslems emerged from their
weekly prayers at India's largest mosque Friday and burned an
effigy of President Bush to protest the American presence in the
Persian Gulf.
   A cloth-and-stick effigy decorated with two American flags and
``Bush'' written across its face was set on fire by Moslem youths
outside the Jama Masjid, or the Jama mosque.
   ``Down with America!'' and ``Long live Arab unity!'' the men
screamed as they pounded the effigy with fists and sticks. Then it
was lit by leaders of the All India Muslim Youth and Students'
Council, the group that organized the protest.
   The council ``fully supports the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
and people of Iraq in their struggle against America and Israel,''
its president, Mohammad Younus Siddiqui, said.
   His speech was greeted with wild cheers by about 200
demonstrators surrounding the burning effigy.
   In a separate statement, the council condemned the Saudi rulers
for ``inviting the unholy Americans and Jews on the holy land.''
   The statement did not specifically comment on Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.

   The marshals Wednesday night confiscated Coe's guitar, $150 in
cash, his silver and turquoise belt and some jewelry, including the
earring, to help satisfy a 1988 court judgment against him from
Florida.
   ``He was very cooperative,'' said Don Benson, chief deputy
marshal. ``We had no problems out of him.''
   Coe, who lives in Missouri, was sued for breach of contract on a
lease he had guaranteed on a building in Florida, said Herbert
Moncier, the plaintiffs' attorney.
   The building apparently was owned by a company in which Coe has
part interest, Moncier said. The judgment is about $152,000
including interest.
   Benson said the marshals waited for the end of Coe's show at the
nightclub in the World's Fair Park before they moved in.
   The nightclub was ``really rocking. They were dancing on the
tables,'' Moncier said. ``We heard he put on a good show,'' Benson
added.

   Singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson
pleaded innocent to misdemeanor counts of drunken driving and
driving without proper insurance.
   The Grammy-winning singer of ``Everybody's Talkin' '' and
``Without You'' entered the pleas Thursday in Municipal Court. A
hearing was scheduled for Sept. 26.
   Nilsson, 49, was stopped by the California Highway Patrol at
3:40 a.m. July 6. Authorities said his blood alcohol level was
three times the legal limit of 0.8 percent.
   Nilsson, whose real name is Harry Edward Nelson III, won the
male pop vocalist Grammy in 1972 for ``Without You'' and he sang
``Everybody's Talkin','' the theme from the Oscar-winning film
``Midnight Cowboy.''

   Former ABC News correspondent Sylvia Chase
says she will return to the network in New York as a correspondent
for ``Prime Time Live,'' the magazine show anchored by Sam
Donaldson and Diane Sawyer.
   She said her interest in returning to reporting was sparked by
last year's events in Tiananmen Square and later, the reunification
of Germany.
   ``I felt almost this pain of wanting to be involved as a
reporter every morning when I picked up The New York Times,'' said
Chase, 52, who came to KRON-TV about five years ago from eight
years on ABC's news program ``20-20.''
   Though no specific dates were given in her announcement
Thursday, Chase is expected to leave her job as 6 p.m. news
co-anchor at KRON this fall.
   Last year, KRON won the broadcasting's prestigious Peabody Award
for Chase's report on homeless children.

   Four-year-old Wade Cowper was really
enjoying his first overnight camping trip with his dad, Gov. Steve
Cowper, until they got to the part about the bears.
   The two camped on a canal north of Juneau on Wednesday night to
celebrate Wade's birthday. They pitched a tent, built a fire and
cooked hot dogs. When Cowper wouldn't let his son take a hot dog
into the tent, Wade asked why.
   Southeast Alaska is bear country, Cowper explained, and bears
sometimes take an interest in food kept in tents.
   ``He wanted to go home right then and there,'' Cowper said
Thursday. ``He said he was scared of bears and he didn't want to be
in that tent with bears, and he was going home.
   ``So I told him, `Look, don't worry. The bears are not going to
be around.''
   Wade toughed out, but there were some anxious moments before he
fell asleep. ``Every time there was a noise you could see his eyes
pop open like saucers, but he was all right,'' Cowper said.
   Thursday morning, Cowper crawled outside and looked down onto
the beach below the bluff where they had staked their tent. And
there was a black bear.
   ``I told him it was there and to come look at him, but he
wouldn't come out of the tent,'' Cowper said. ``He never did see
the bear.''

   Security forces charged opposition
party marchers Friday, clubbing the crowd with batons and firing
tear gas to break up a rally near the residence of President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny.
   Several hundred demonstrators briefly sought refuge in the
courtyard of the French Embassy, climbing its walls to escape
police. French Ambassador Michel Dupuch spoke with authorities who
permitted him to escort the demonstrators out of the embassy
grounds without incident.
   At least five people suffered minor injuries when the
demonstration was dispersed, witnesses said.
   Some of the marchers shouted for the resignation of
Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled this West African nation since
independence from France in 1960.
   Defense Minister Jean Konan Banny had issued a warning Thursday
that security forces would ``use all necessary measures'' to
prevent the opposition parties from threatening public order.
   The rally occurred four days before the scheduled reopening of
public schools, which were closed in mid-term in April after
students and teachers joined demonstrations demanding the
legalization of opposition parties.
   Ivory Coast, once considered the economic showcase of
sub-Saharan Africa, has been experiencing grave economic problems.
   The over-valuation of the French-backed West African franc has
made its products too expensive to compete with other countries.
Tax rates are among the highest in the world.
   Attempts to raise taxes even more and cut government pay checks
earlier this year sparked the worst wave of unrest since
independence. Many government workers, including police officers,
firefighters, soldiers and customs agents, went on strike.
   Houphouet-Boigny was forced to withdraw some austerity measures
and grant demands to permit opposition parties to form.
   Though the parties were legalized, they say their efforts to
hold public meetings have often been blocked by government
officials.
   Houphouet-Boigny also has been criticized for construction of a
Roman Catholic basilica in his native town of Yamossoukro. The
government says the basilica cost about $133 million and was paid
for from Houphouet-Boigny's personal funds.
   Pope John Paul II is to consecrate the basilica Sept. 10.

   Bond was set at $1 million today for a
University of Florida student charged in an assault in another
county. But police insisted they didn't have a prime suspect in the
slayings of five college students.
   Police in Gainesville today sealed an apartment near the
University of Florida. Neighbors identified the apartment as that
of Edward Lewis Humphrey, an 18-year-old freshman.
   Humphrey was arrested Thursday at the home of his 79-year-old
grandmother in Indialantic, 180 miles to the southeast. He was
charged with aggravated battery on a person over 65.
   Brevard Circuit Judge Dean Moxley today set bond at $1 million.
   Sheriff's spokeswoman Joan Heller wouldn't comment on the high
bond, saying the case was being directed by the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement, a state investigation agency.
   About 600 law enforcement officials are involved in a hunt for
the killer, who investigators have said is a ``methodical maniac''
with a sick grudge against petite brunettes with shoulder-length
hair.
   The victims _ students at either the University of Florida or
Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbed to death in off-campus
apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday. Police said
three of the four women were mutilated.
   Alachua County Sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann emphasized today that
``at this particular time, we continue to have a pool of suspects
... to say that we have a prime suspect or prime two suspects or
three suspects is very premature.''
   Police Lt. Sadie Darnell said today there had been ``no
significant'' developments in the investigation.
   Humphrey reportedly once lived in the Gatorwood apartment
complex where the latest two victims were found Tuesday and he left
Gainesville on Wednesday.
   Investigators interviewed Humphrey on Thursday, Brevard
authorities said today. Humphrey ``appears to be a suspect in some
pretty serious crimes in Alachua (County),'' said Randy Moore, an
assistant public defender in Brevard County. Moore did not
elaborate.
   Funerals were being held today for four of the victims in their
hometowns. They are Christina Powell, 17, of Jacksonville; Christa
Hoyt, 18, of Newberry; Tracy Paules, 23, of Coral Gables; and
Manuel Taboada, 23, of Miami.
   On Thursday, more that a thousand friends and family members
gathered at a Pompano Beach church to mourn Miss Powell's roommate,
18-year-old Sonja Larson.
   ``It is so untimely that one so young, made of all the dreams
she was made of, would be taken from us,'' said the Rev. Ken Smith,
pastor of the First Baptist Church.
   Police were interviewing possible suspects already in custody
and checking out others who aren't, including a man sought for a
gory slashing in Ohio earlier this month, said Darnell.
   The Miami Herald reported today that investigators suspect the
killer is a white man in his late 20s to early 30s.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said the
preliminary profile drawn up by investigators also concludes that
the killer may have law enforcement or health care ties, such as a
job as a security guard or hospital orderly, who likely frequents
student hangouts.
   The Gainesville Sun reported today that authorities were eager
to find a man identified as Warren Virgil Tinch, wanted for the
stabbing death and mutilation of Phyllis Elam, a 52-year-old woman
from Middletown, Ohio.
   Elam's body was found in woods near her home, her face stabbed
so many times she was identifiable only through dental records.
   ``He (Tinch) is a possible suspect. Where he fits in on the
hierarchy of suspects, I don't know,'' Darnell said.
   Edwin Boldt, a spokesman for the Cincinnati FBI office, said any
connection between Tinch and the Florida slayings was ``definitely
a long shot.''
   Witnesses allegedly spotted Tinch, 58, of Franklin, Ohio, in
Gainesville and nearby Ocala about a week before the murders, the
newspaper reported. He allegedly stole vehicles from car
dealerships in the towns on Aug. 16 and Aug. 17.
   Investigators were sent to Bartow in central Florida, where the
Polk County Sheriff's Department was holding a man arrested for
burglary who discussed the killings after turning himself in to
police. But spokeswoman Lynn Breidenbach said he could have learned
the information from news reports.
   Authorities also said they interviewed men in Polk and Hernando
counties, then dismissed both as suspects.
   The killings have released a wave of fear in this college town,
exacerbated by published reports that the killer stole flesh from
some of the mutilated victims and placed a decapitated victim's
head on a shelf. Police have given few details about the
mutilations.
   A 24-hour rumor-control hot line at the Alachua County Crisis
Center has racked up more than 4,000 calls since Monday.
   Many students left town early for the Labor Day weekend, but
University of Florida President John Lombardi asserted that things
were returning to normal. School officials said the frightened
departure of some hundreds of students had little impact on the
student body of 34,000 in its opening week of classes.
   Other state universities said they were getting inquiries about
transfers.

<TEXT>
   The commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf described the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as
``international rape'' Friday and said war can be averted if Iraqi
troops stay out of Saudi Arabia.
   Calling Iraqi generals ``a bunch of thugs,'' Army Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf also said he could not let the fate of hostages in Iraq
affect his strategy.
   ``I am just as concerned as everyone else about the hostages,
but I am planning a military campaign and I can't concern myself
with the hostages. That's the honest answer,'' said the four-star
general, who arrived in Saudi Arabia this week to set up military
headquarters.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has kept about 21,000 Westerners
_ including 3,000 Americans and 4,500 Britons _ from leaving the
country.
   The United States and other Western governments have accused the
Iraqi leader of using the foreigners as ``human shields'' against
attack.
   Schwarzkopf, a hulking man known to aides as ``The Bear,'' met
with reporters following a tour of forward troop positions and port
facilities.
   He said the U.S. units were well-equipped and prepared to repel
any Iraqi attack and protect themselves from chemical weapons.
   ``I am confident of our ability to defend right now,''
Schwarzkopf said. ``Nothing is ever 100 percent guaranteed, but if
the Iraqis are dumb enough to attack, they are going to pay a
terrible price.''
   He added, ``If the Iraqis use chemical weapons, they'll pay for
it big time.''
   It was Schwarzkopf's first visit to the troops since moving the
regional military Central Command headquarters from MacDill Air
Force Base near Tampa, Fla., to the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
   The command was established in 1983 to be responsible for U.S.
military affairs in 19 countries in the Middle East, southwest Asia
and northeast Africa. It was based in the United States because no
nation in the three regions was willing to act as host.
   The general reacting sharply to a question about whether U.S.
troops were being told they were ``defending oil.''
   ``It's not just a question of oil,'' he said. ``There's not a
single service member out there who thinks this _ not any I've met
... anybody who has any doubt in their mind about what Iraq has
done should get into another line of work.
   ``What you have here is a situation where not only is this a
mugging, but a rape has occurred ... an international rape of the
first order.''
   Schwarzkopf admitted he was surprised by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   ``We knew their capability but misjudged their intention,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Biologists Find Ancient Aleut Burial Cave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ancient burial cave containing the
mummified remains of more than 30 people has been found in the
Aleutians. The discovery is being called one of the most important
in Alaska in years.
   A volunteer working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
discovered the cave in June while looking for fox dens on an
uninhabited island, Chuck Diters, the agency's regional
archaeologist, said Friday. Foxes are being eradicated to protect a
rare species of goose.
   ``This discovery is unquestionably one of the most important
archeological finds in Alaska in a half-century,'' said Diters.
   Well-preserved artifacts found in the cave include weapons,
household goods, and artwork, and some toys that were buried with
children.
   The location was not disclosed.
   ``They were real closed-mouth about it, very careful in order to
protect it from pot hunters. They didn't even radio information
about the find. We didn't know about it until they got back to Adak
in June.''
   Since then, archaeologists have been studying the cave's
contents.
   The Aleut Corp., the regional native corporation that has rights
to the remains and artifacts under the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act, authorized their removal to the University of
Connecticut and Vassar College for further examination.
   All will be returned to Alaska when the studies are complete to
become the property of the Aleut Corp., Diters said.
   ``This does not represent the discovery of any new culture,'' he
said. ``But it gives us a chance to look at a previously
uninvestigated area that has the full range of its occupation
materials in a single area not previously disturbed.
   ``Most sites in the Aleutians and in other areas of the state
are overlaid by other cultures, so they're fragmentary through
other disturbance. With this, we've got a chance to see a more
tightly focused and cleared (cultural) picture.''
   ``The last previous work in this area was done in the '30s, in a
hasty fashion and without regard for information that can be
determined in a careful, controlled examination,'' Diters said.
   Scientists suspect the area around the cave was a village and
they hope to expand their investigation next year.
   ``It's rare we get the opportunity to excavate the burial and
village site in same situation,'' Diters said.
   Although not totally preserved, the human remains had been
ceremonially mummified and wrapped for burial in finely woven grass
mats, in accordance with Aleut burial rites, Diters said.
   ``We found bodies of both sexes and all ages, from less than
one-year-old infants to old, toothless elders,'' said Lucy Lewis
Johnson, an archaeologist on the faculty of Vassar in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y.
   ``This cave has given us a priceless glimpse of a realm of
culture,'' she said. ``It is unique not just because of the number
of bodies, but also because it has so many well preserved organic
artifacts.''
   That includes a finely carved, wooden sculpture of a whale or
fish, with a sea otter or small human on its snout and a bird in
flight at the tip of its jaw.

   Iraq placed new demands on the West today that delayed the
departure of 237 women and children from Baghdad. Iraq also
announced that it was sending more foreign men to military targets
to shield the sites from attack.
   The developments came as the U.N. secretary-general met with
Iraq's foreign minister in Jordan to try to negotiate a solution to
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Iraqi spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said the 237 foreigners can be
flown to London and Paris on Iraq Airways if the airline is allowed
to retrieve an unspecified number of Iraqis stranded in the two
European capitals by the ``brutal American sanctions.''
   Asked about the fate of the women and children if Britain and
France rejected the request, al-Hadithi replied only: ``We hope
that the two governments respond quickly and positively to this
humanitarian request.''
   Later, al-Hadithi said meeting the request was not a
precondition to Iraq's allowing foreign women and children to leave
the country. But if it is not met, he said, they might have to
leave by land.
   The international trade sanctions the United Nations imposed on
Iraq do no place restrictions on Iraqis living in other countries.
   Britain said it would not object to Iraqi nationals returning on
flights that take foreigners to London. France said all foreigners
must be freed from Iraq unconditionally and that it would not trade
French citizens for Iraqis.
   The White House said President Bush spoke to Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President
Francois Mitterrand in a series of phone calls today on the crisis.
   Bush is urging wealthy allies to help foot the $1
billion-a-month cost of deploying U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and
the gulf region.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that the
military buildup in the Persian Gulf ``makes the situation
explosive, very dangerous.''
   ``We have to act responsibly, all of us, to prevent a
large-scale conflict,'' Gorbachev said.
   In other developments, six more warships from the United States,
Britain and the Netherlands entered Egypt's Suez Canal en route
toward the gulf. Dozens of ships have assembled in the region since
Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Nineteen Italians, meanwhile, arrived safely in Jordan today
from Iraq. They are believed to be among the first Westerners to go
free under Iraq's offer to release women and children hostages.
   About 60,000 U.S. combat troops have moved to battle stations
and their number is expected to hit 100,000 soon to face the
estimated 265,000 soldiers of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein who
are stationed in and around Kuwait.
   The commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, said today that U.S. deployment there is ahead of
schedule, though he gave no figures.
   He also said there will be no war unless Iraq starts one, a move
he said would bring swift retaliation and prove to be ``an awfully
stupid mistake.''
   Schwarzkopf, in his first news conference since moving his
command post to Saudi Arabia, repeatedly ducked questions about
specific U.S. military options under consideration. But he said the
United States was not looking to start hostilities.
   ``There's not going to be any war unless the Iraqi's attack,''
Schwarzkopf told reporters after spending the day visiting American
troops in northeast Saudi Arabia.
   He also said his military plans were made without regard to the
issue of Westeners being held hostage in Iraq.
   Also today, an Israeli military source said that Jordanian
military planes are flying spy missions along the Saudi Arabian
border to supply Iraq with information on troop movements.
   The Jordanian reconnaissance flights are being flown by
U.S.-made F-5 jets, and are giving a view of troop movements dozens
of miles into Saudia Arabia, the source said.
   The U.N. chief and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz met twice
today at the Royal Palace in Amman, Jordan. No immediate progress
was reported, but the negotiators were expected to issue a
statement later.
   A senior Jordanian official, who had met with the U.N. chief
before the talks with Aziz began, said there was a ``strong
possibility'' that Perez de Cuellar will travel to Baghdad for
talks.
   He said no such decision has been made, but the U.N. chief was
prepared to fly to Iraq to meet President Saddam Hussein if the
talks with Aziz fail to produce any significant progress.
   Perez de Cuellar had said the current talks would be within the
framework of U.N. resolutions passed after the invasion. The
resolutions demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and imposed
economic sanctions on the Baghdad government.
   Aziz declared on arrival at Amman's airport that Iraq ``will
achieve victory despite the international conspiracy against it.''
   His defiant statement contrasted with hopeful comments by Perez
de Cuellar on Thursday. The U.N. chief said then he believed ``Iraq
is as eager as we all are to find a just and lasting solution of
the problem.''
   Also today, sources in Baghdad said Iraq has issued coupon books
and set up centers to distribute food when national rationing
begins Saturday.
   On the 25th day of a U.N. embargo against Iraq, long lines
snaked out of bakeries in the Iraqi capital, residents said.
Refugees fleeing Iraq earlier this week reported lines outside food
shops in smaller desert towns.
   Al-Hadithi said the 237 foreign women and children include 123
Britons, 66 Japanese, 19 French, 14 Americans, two Australians and
four others of unspecified nationalities.
   He also said an unspecified number of women and children from
other countries that he did not name were ``in principle'' free to
leave immediately.
   He said their governments had to make arrangements for their
departure.
   However, he said the foreign men still held in Iraq are being
held at potential military targets all over the country.
   ``Every place, every town that has a vital installation will
host our guests,'' he said.
   In addition to the Italian nationals, three Finnish women left
Iraq for Turkey, the Finnish Foreign Ministry said today. In
Athens, a government spokesman said five Greek women and children
were expected to leave Iraq on a flight from Baghdad. And Sweden's
Foreign Ministry said the 50 Swedish women and children stranded in
Iraq have received exit permits and may leave Baghdad Saturday.
   Britain's Foreign Office said Iraq has issued exit visas to 139
British women and children, all now detained at a Baghdad hotel, to
leave on an Iraqi jet. But British officials do not know when the
Iraqi jet will leave.
   Iraq assembled more than 200 foreign women and children hostages
at Baghdad's Menia Hotel on Thursday after promising to release
them. Some were held earlier at Iraqi military and civilian
targets, used as human shields by Saddam to discourage possible
U.S. attacks.
   The foreigners at the hotel were mostly from the United States,
Britain, France, Japan and Australia.
   The Baghdad government said this week that foreign women and
children would be allowed to depart as of Wednesday, but still
required exit visas.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Americans
still awaited the permits, adding: ``This emotional roller coaster
is inhumane and disgraceful.''
   Since today is the Moslem sabbath, exit visas were not expected
before Saturday.
   The U.N. Security Council has denounced Iraq for preventing
21,000 Westerners _ including 3,000 Americans and 4,500 Britons _
and other foreigners from leaving.

   Milwaukee County officials trying to reduce
welfare fraud are considering a unique program that would leave
recipients with little discretionary cash.
   The program would require direct payment of welfare recipients'
housing, utility and food bills through vouchers, electronic fund
transfers or government-appointed third parties.
   The plan's sponsor said he hoped the program would end abuses of
Aid to Families with Dependent Children in which cash benefits are
spent wrongly by adults and children are left to suffer.
   ``I'm not embarking on a course of welfare bashing,'' said
County Supervisor Richard D. Nyklewicz. ``I'm trying to be a
responsible representative and ensure the money is used for its
intended purpose.''
   But a lawyer for Legal Action of Wisconsin, an advocacy group,
said she would also oppose the cashless system.
   ``I think it's terrible,'' said Shirin Cabraal. ``It's a real
patronizing type of attitude toward welfare recipients _ the whole
idea that welfare recipients are not capable of handling welfare
benefits.''
   If approved by Milwaukee County, Nyklewicz's experiment still
would need state and federal approval.
   The Milwaukee County Social Services Committee began its review
of the proposal this week but delayed a decision until next month.
   Supervisor Elizabeth Coggs-Jones asked for the delay to allow
the County Health and Social Services Department to research
whether there are viable alternatives that won't take free choice
away from welfare recipients.
   ``I'm not a proponent of cashless voucher systems. I think it's
not true welfare reform,'' she said. ``True welfare reform is
educating people and training them to get decent jobs with decent
wages and benefits.''
   The federal government already permits the use of welfare
benefit vouchers to pay vendors like landlords and utility
companies but only in cases where a recipient has mismanaged funds
or needs special assistance.
   Gary Ashcraft, director of the Division of Program Evaluation
for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Washington,
said the Milwaukee program would be the nation's first to not use
cash for general welfare in ordinary cases.
   Jason Turner, director of the department's Office of Family
Assistance, said he disliked the idea because ``welfare recipients,
generally, should receive the money and make their own decisions
with it.''
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who has initiated two state welfare
experiments, said he would support the Milwaukee County plan and
help obtain the necessary state and federal approval.
   ``If we can have this cashless system set up to assist people
better, then ... from what people tell me, it's a step in the right
direction,'' he said.
   Thompson urged approval in 1987 of Wisconsin's Learnfare
program, which allows the state to cut a welfare family's monthly
AFDC benefits if one or more of its teen-agers have been
consistently absent from school.
   The program was suspended in Milwaukee this summer by a federal
judge who said families were being unfairly sanctioned by
inaccurate attendance records in Milwaukee schools.
   The Thompson administration also has experimented with a program
called Workfare, which requires welfare recipients to participate
in job training or work part-time to keep their benefits.
   Milwaukee County, the state's largest with a population of about
970,000, distributes $6.4 million per month in food stamps and
$16.6 million in AFDC benefits.
   One AFDC recipient, Calvin Hopson, 43, said he believed there
was too much mismanagement. ``In a way, I think vouchers would
help,'' Hopson said.

<HEAD>Coupons Issued, Food Points Open as Iraq Prepares for Rationing</HEAD>

   National rationing takes effect Saturday
in Iraq, and authorities have issued coupon books and set up
centers to distribute food, sources in Baghdad said. But the Iraqi
capital was already feeling the squeeze.
   Long lines snaked out of bakeries in Baghdad, residents said.
Refugees fleeing Iraq earlier this week reported long queues
outside food shops in smaller desert towns.
   Flour, rice, dried beans, grain, and powdered milk had
dissapeared from shops, the Baghdad sources said, and meat vanished
days ago.
   Pharmacy shelves were empty of medicines, and hospital officials
spoke of dwindling supplies of antibiotics and anesthesia, said
sources contacted by telephone from Nicosia.
   Iraq has two to four months stock of staple food, according to
U.S. government and trade estimates. Some experts speculate that if
the country tightens its belt, it could stretch its stocks to
withstand a six-month siege.
   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh earlier this week reassured
his countrymen via the government-controlled media that Iraq had
enough food to last a long time. He did not say how long.
   Rationing coupons issued in Iraq entitle each person to a
monthly allocation of 13 pounds of flour, 3.3 pounds of rice, 2.2
pounds of sugar, 3.5 ounces of tea, 1.1 pounds of oil, 17 ounces of
detergent and one bar of soap.
   Children under a year old receive three tins of powdered milk
each month, but older children receive none. Fresh fruit and
vegetables from summer crops remained plentiful, sources said.
   ``It's also pretty well accepted that Iraqis store more basic
foods than would be expected in other countries, and no one has any
idea what people have at home,'' said Andrew Bellingham, a farm
trade analyst with World Perspectives Inc., in Washington D.C.
   ``It's a natural tendency to keep extra stock in any situation
of instability _ such as Iraqis faced during the gulf war _ and you
also have had the Iraqi government encouraging it,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   President Saddam Hussein announced 10 days after the invasion of
Kuwait that the country would have to prepare for austerity. Since
then, hoarding and profiteering have been punishable by death.
   Iraqi people have been better fed in recent years than their
neighbors in Turkey, Syria, Iran and elsewhere.
   U.S. officials estimate that the average Iraqi consumes 3,300
calories each day and could cut back without health difficulties to
the same 2,500-2,900 consumed by people in nearby countries.
   Consumption in Iraq is above the top end of the range for a
healthy diet recommended by U.S. dieticians.
   As final preparations were under way to begin rationing, Iraq on
Friday sought to barter oil for food. It offered an undetermined
amount of crude oil in return for 50,000 metric tons of sugar,
officials in Manila said.
   The offer was under study by the Philippines, which relied
heavily on Iraq and Kuwait for its oil needs.
   Baghdad's offer to barter was evidence of a worsening cash
shortage stemming from the Aug. 6 U.N. trade embargo that has cut
off the export of oil, Iraq's main source of revenue. Experts have
said the oil embargo is a more powerful weapon than the embargo of
food.
   Much of the food consumed by Iraq's 17 million people,
especially rice and flour, was purchased from the United States and
has not yet been paid for. Baghdad still owes the United States
about $2 billion for food delivered before the invasion of Kuwait.
   Last year, Iraq spent $2.9 billion importing about 75 percent of
its food from the United States, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Sri
Lanka and elsewhere.
   Decades of central planning, the eight-year war with Iran and
the forced relocation of rebellious Kurdish peasants in the fertile
north have decimated Iraqi agriculture.
   Attempts had been under way before the invasion to try to repair
some of the damage and encourage individual enterprise.
   This week, Agriculture Minister Abdelwahab Mahmoud said the
government was considering new measures to encourage production of
more food.
   Despite the embargo, there have been reports of some supplies
getting through to Iraq by air and by truck from Jordan.
   A senior British military official, Air Chief Marshal Sir
Patrick Hine, suggested earlier this week to reporters in Dharan,
Saudi Arabia, that the embargo might have to be strengthened by
blocking the airspace around Iraq. Military experts pointed out it
would more difficult and dangerous to stop aircraft than ships.
   Reports filtering out of Kuwait City said Iraqi troops had
emptied warehouses near Kuwait's port and hauled the contents on
tractor-trailer rigs to Baghdad. Poultry, canned goods and frozen
meat were said to have been taken from the warehouses, according to
the unconfirmed reports.

<HEAD>Justice Refuses to Block Extradition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice Friday refused to
block extradition to Israel of an American citizen accused of being
a Palestinian terrorist.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun denied an emergency request by Mahmoud
El-Abed Ahmad, who is charged in Israel with participating in a
machine-gun attack on a bus traveling through the Occupied West
Bank.
   U.S. officials have said they would move promptly to extradite
him to Israel if the courts did not intervene.
   Ahmad, 37, who hasn't been charged with a crime in this country,
has been in jail since his arrest three years ago while lawyers
argued over whether he could get a fair trial in Israel. His
lawyers said he would be tortured by Israeli security officers if
sent there.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City on Aug.
10 rejected Ahmad's argument that the alleged crime was a political
act not covered by an extradition treaty with Israel.
   The appeals court said political motivation does not convert
every crime into a political offense.
   Ahmad is represented by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark.
   Ahmad, who Israeli authorities sometimes refer to as Mahmoud
Abed Atta, is charged with taking part in an April 12, 1986, attack
in which three Palestine Liberation Organization terrorists hurled
firebombs and then opened fire with machine guns on a bus carrying
Jewish settlers en route to Tel Aviv.
   The bus driver was killed and a passenger was injured.
   Ahmad left Israel after the attack and was arrested by FBI
agents in 1987 on a flight from Venezuela.

   Elvis Presley, yes; Marilyn Monroe, no. Albert
Einstein, yes; Al Capone, no. Babe Ruth, yes; Magic Johnson, no.
   Life Magazine unveiled its list Friday of the 100 Most
Influential Americans of the 20th century, and those among the
missing are as interesting as those who made it.
   No Madonna, no Magic, no Michael Jordan. No Clark Gable. No
Greta Garbo. No Al Jolson.
   Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Not on this list. Not a
single U.S. president _ and there were 17 since 1900.
   So who did make it?
   Elvis, Albert and the Babe. Polio vaccine inventor Jonas Salk
and infant care guru Dr. Benjamin Spock. The king of rock 'n' roll
is joined by a half-dozen other musicians: Louis Armstrong, Irving
Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, Bing Crosby, Bob Dylan and Richard
Rodgers.
   ``It's a list of the most influential people of the past 100
years, not the famous,'' said Mary Steinbauer, editor of the
special issue. ``In making our selections we looked at how our
lives would be different if each of our honorees didn't live.''
   More than 60 historians and other experts were consulted by Life
in making the list. Only three people received unanimous support,
the magazine reported: the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford.
   Missing completely are the 17 presidents of the 20th century.
``Every president is important to us _ that's the nature of the
job,'' said Steinbauer. One first lady made the list: Eleanor
Roosevelt.
   More than half of the list was born in the 19th century, and
only 21 of the honorees are still living.
   Marlon Brando was the lone actor to make the list; from the
world of sports, Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Jackie Robinson
joined the Bambino.
   Activists-advocates was second to the sciences in producing
honorees. Thirteen of them were cited, including civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill
W., and feminist Betty Friedan.
   As a group, the 100 captured 11 Nobel Prizes, five Pulitzer
Prizes and four Academy Awards. Twenty of them never graduated high
school, including Walt Disney, William Faulkner, Jackson Pollock
and Malcolm X.
   Thirteen were born in a foreign country and later became U.S.
citizens, such as choreographer George Balanchine (Russia) and
scientist Wernher von Braun (Germany). New York was the state that
produced the most honorees, 14, double that of runner-up Illinois.
   The list also included Life's founder, Henry Luce. Life said the
100 were selected from a field of 636 people under consideration.

   Two congressional delegations left Friday for
the tense Middle East, signaling that Capitol Hill plans to assume
a larger role in U.S. policy dealing with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We're moving from a process in which this was mostly
presidential to one where there is more congressional
involvement,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., a member of the
House GOP leadership.
   When the House and Senate return to regular session beginning
the week of Sept. 10, there will be a round of hearings that will
include reviews of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, military
deployment and energy policy, and the impact of all of them on the
federal budget.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will be among the first to
testify, appearing Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee and Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   ``The members of our delegation will be making decisions over
the next several weeks ... all of which are affected by the crisis
in the gulf,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
who was leading the 22-member House delegation.
   Leaving about the same time in a matching blue-and-white Air
Force version of the Boeing 707 was a 14-member Senate delegation
led by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
   The separate delegations had similar itineraries: briefings by
U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, including military commanders, and
visits with U.S. troops in the field at Dhahran and Air Force units
stationed in Bahrain.
   On Sunday the two groups were to meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
for discussions with Kuwaiti and Saudi officials. On Monday, both
groups were scheduled to meet in Cairo with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   The House delegation is scheduled to return to the United States
on Monday, while the senators were to meet with officials in Oman
and the United Arab Emirates and return Tuesday.
   ``We may be there for a long time, and the morale of our troops
is absolutely critical,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member
of the Armed Services Committee.
   Referring to alternately raised and lowered hopes for the
release of hostages by the Iraqi president, Levin added: ``We
cannot be used as a yo-yo by Saddam Hussein, and that means our
willpower must remain strong.''
   Lawmakers said they were interested in assessing what additional
troops allies might commit to the military buildup and progress
toward cost-sharing by countries that benefit from the continued
flow of Middle East oil.
   Concern also was voiced about Arab solidarity against Saddam.
   ``I'm particularly anxious to learn ... what the impact of a
long-term standoff would be, to what degree Saddam Hussein has the
ability to create dissension within the Arab world,'' said Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Another goal, said Sen. William Cohen, is to deter a flood of
members of Congress to the region that might distract U.S. forces
from their primary mission.
   ``It would be very inconvenient for them to have to deal with''
such an influx, Cohen said. This group will share what it learns
with colleagues on Capitol Hill and hope to discourage further
congressional travel, he said.
   The Senate delegation also included: Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; David
Durenberger, R-Minn.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.;
and Conrad Burns, R-Mont.
   Others in the House contingent were: Reps. Robert Michel,
R-Ill.; Steny Hoyer, D-Md.; Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.; Les Aspin,
D-Wis.; Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss.; Beverly Byron, D-Md.; William
Dickinson, R-Ala.; Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis.; Dave McCurdy,
D-Okla.; Bud Shuster, R-Pa.; Billy Tauzin, D-La.; Edolphus Towns,
D-N.Y.; William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; Sam
Gibbons, D-Fla.; Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich.; David Obey, D-Wis.;
Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.; Dante Fascell, D-Fla.; and William
Broomfield, R-Mich.

<HEAD>200,000 Children Will Be Hurt on the Job, Group Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen-year-old Matthew Garvey was taking a
break from his summer job at the car wash when his leg was sucked
into a drying machine and severed from his body. The company was
fined $400.
   According to a report released Friday by the American Youth Work
Center, a youth advocacy group, an estimated 200,000 children will
be injured this year on the job.
   ``On Labor Day, we celebrate the efforts of working men and
women,'' said Linda Golodner of the National Consumers League.
``But we also need to focus attention on the young workers of our
country.''
   The American Youth Work Center predicts some 40,000 cases of
child labor violations will be reported this year, almost double
the number found in 1989.
   ``Deaths and injuries are increasing dramatically and yet are
spread thinly across the country,'' said AYWC's William Treanor.
``And so all that people have are anecdotal stories. Everybody can
think of one gruesome, horrible incident that they're aware of and
they think that that's some sort of freak occurrence. '
   Quality Car Wash in Laurel, Md., had hired Matthew to dry cars
with cloths, though Matthew had no work permit and was underage.
Matthew said several other children also worked there, including an
8-year-old.
   Matthew received $400 from the company because the dryer had no
lid covering the fan blades. The car wash also was fined $10,000
for child labor law violations, but the money went to the state.
   The car wash has since gone out of business.
   ``There were no cops on the beat to say to that employer `you
cannot employ these young people,''' said Golodner. She said it was
very tempting for employers to violate child labor laws because the
chances of getting caught are slim, and even if they do get caught
they'll only get a ``slap on the wrist.''
   ``In any way you look at it child labor is cheap labor.''
Golodner said. ``Many don't know they're being exploited, and
because it may be their first job they want to please their
employer.''
   The Department of Labor conducted a one-day sweep of businesses
in June this year, uncovering 3,800 cases of child labor violation.
Most of the cases involved youngsters working more hours than the
laws allow, but many were using dangerous machinery.
   As a result of the sweep, the Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
announced that the administration would back legislation to
increase fines from $1,000 to $10,000 the maximum penalty for
violations.
   The legislation, co-sponsored by Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
and Don Pease, D-Ohio, will go to the floor when Congress gets back
to work this fall.
   But Treanor said it was likely the bill would be held up by
other priorities facing Congress and added that it wasn't
far-reaching enough to be effective.
   One area not covered by proposed legislation is agricultural. An
estimated 300 children are killed every year in farm work, and more
than 23,000 are injured. In July this year, investigators from the
Department of Labor found children as young as 3 years old working
as migrant laborers in Northern California.
   The National Consumer's League and AYWC are calling on Congress
and the Labor Department to update the child laws on the books
since 1938, create stiffer penalties for violations and to step up
reporting and enforcement efforts.
   Treanor said businesses themselves should develop and enforce
standards for working youths. ``If MacDonalds started serving green
cheese or something, they're going to go nuts at MacDonalds'
headquarters,'' said Treanor. ``Why don't these companies go nuts
when they find out that a 14-year-old just sliced her hand off in
one of their fast food joints?''

   President F.W. de Klerk called
Friday for the governing National Party, which implemented
apartheid four decades ago, to accept non-whites as members.
   De Klerk said the all-white party's restrictions were at odds
with its goal of creating a democracy free of domination by any
race or group.
   ``The new South Africa demands that those who belong together
through inner conviction should come together,'' he told a party
provincial congress in Durban.
   The African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups
called de Klerk's proposal welcome but overdue. The leader of the
right-wing Conservative Party denounced it.
   The government is looking for political allies among black
political groups to buttress its position in negotiations with the
ANC, the main black opposition movement, on sharing power.
   The ANC seeks a one-man, one-vote system, virtually guaranteeing
a black majority government. De Klerk wants protection for whites
and other minority groups, a free market economy and guaranteed
rights, such as the right to own property.
   The congress and three other upcoming provincial meetings are
expected to approve accepting non-whites. Even with the change,
black party members would not be able to vote for the party's
candidates in national balloting because apartheid bars them from
voting in national elections.
   ``Better late than never,'' ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said of
the proposed change. ``I'm sure there are some blacks who would
join, but I can't imagine why.''
   Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht, an opponent of
power sharing, said the National Party had committed political
suicide because, he said, people want nationalism, not integration.
   Accepting blacks and other races would reverse the National
Party's heritage as the architect of apartheid. It won power in
1948 on a platform of white dominance and has been the main voice
of Afrikaner nationalism, representing whites of mostly Dutch
descent who dominate South African politics.
   Under apartheid, the country's 5 million whites control the
government and economy while the 30 million blacks have no voice in
national affairs.
   Since replacing P.W. Botha as president in 1989, de Klerk has
pushed for repeal of apartheid laws and held talks with the ANC.
   His efforts have caused more whites to leave the National Party
for the right-wing Conservative Party and extremist groups.
   In his speech, de Klerk accused Treurnicht of advocating
violence to prevent change in South Africa. He said the
Conservative Party sought continued policies of oppression, which
would bring the country ``to its knees.''
   ``Racism and discrimination in South Africa is gone forever,''
de Klerk said.
   ``The National Party accepts there will be an inevitable
realignment in the party political sphere in the new South Africa
it is building,'' he said. It also believes ``the basis for future
cooperation should be laid now; otherwise, valuable opportunities
will be lost.''
   In an earlier speech to the congress, Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok said fighting between black factions could resume at
any time and push South Africa into a spiral of violence.
   Vlok, who heads the police, also said rising crime could trigger
violence between whites and blacks. He said tension was being
stoked by strikes, black consumer boycotts and terrorist attacks.
   Fighting erupted Aug. 12 in black townships near Johannesburg
and raged for almost two weeks. Zulu followers of the conservative
Inkatha movement fought Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the ANC
with axes, spears, guns and knives.
   The two groups oppose South Africa's apartheid system of racial
separation but are divided by leadership rivalry, tribal loyalty
and differing visions of a future South Africa.
   The government last week imposed emergency restrictions and sent
in troops to aid police in the areas of violence. Police said
Friday the Johannesburg townships were quiet.
   About 500 university students marched Friday to police
headquaters in Cape Town to protest the recent unrest. Unlike the
previous two days, police made no effort to block the students, who
presented a statement charging police had sided with Inkatha.
   The ANC, church leaders and others also have accused police of
bias during the fighting. The government has rejected the
accusations.
   In Lusaka, Zambia, ANC leader Nelson Mandela said Friday he is
not ready to meet with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to try
to end the fighting. ``We can not meet a man who wants to see the
blood of black people, that we can not do,'' Mandela told reporters
on his arrival at Lusaka airport.
   In the past, Mandela has blamed Buthelezi for the violence.
   In other developments Friday, the government confirmed that 15
prisoners would be released sometime after the weekend. The
government and the ANC agreed Aug. 6 on a review process to free
political detainees starting Sept. 1.

<TEXT>
   One day before the anniversary of the war
that drove them apart, the German states signed a sweeping treaty
Friday meant as a final blueprint for bringing them together.
   German leaders met in a 17th century palace of German princes to
sign the document, which seeks to reconcile the stark differences
between two societies that will form one nation Oct. 3.
   The pact will allow East Germany to retain its liberal abortion
law and gives Western investors more rights to buy East German
land, a measure economists say is necessary to rescue the nation's
dire economy.
   It also calls for Berlin to become the capital of a united
Germany, guarantees some social programs for jobless East Germans,
and recognizes the five states East Germany will become in a united
nation.
   The treaty leaves many crucial decisions on uniting the nations
to the new government that will be elected to lead both nations
Dec. 2.
   The 900-page document was signed by West German Interior
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and East Germany's top unity
negotiator, Guenther Krause.
   Earlier, the cabinets of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere formally approved the
pact.
   ``Today we are fulfilling one of the last remaining hurdles to
German unification,'' de Maiziere said.
   The parliaments of the two nations likely will approve the
treaty next week.
   The signing took place on the eve of the 51st anniversary of
World War II. On Sept. 1, 1939, Hitler's forces invaded Poland, and
France and England declared the war that eventually split Germany.
   The treaty promises that the new united Germany will respect the
borders of its European neighbors.
   The pact reconciles some fundamental legal and political
differences between two nations that followed vastly different
paths after they were carved from the conquered Nazi empire.
   Schaeuble said the goal of the broad accord ``was to again
standardize what had been 45 years of of developing separate
systems of laws and differing economic and living conditions.''
   The treaty was the product of intense negotiations between West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats
and the left-leaning Social Democrats, who are campaigning to win
the Dec. 2 elections.
   Key aspects of the treaty _ particularly the differences between
East Germany's liberal abortion law and West Germany's strict one _
were held up by intense politicking that threatened the accord.
   The treaty itself was not necessary to German unification
because East Germany already has voted to merge with West Germany.
   But failure to approve it would have meant that West German laws
would have become the law of both lands without accommodating the
vastly different society reared on socialism.
   Although Berlin has been designated the capital, it is still
undecided whether it, or the current West German capital, Bonn,
will be the seat of the new government. Germany also must decide
what to do with the massive East German bureaucracy still largely
composed of functionaries from the old regime ousted last autumn.
   The treaty is a companion piece to the economic pact that merged
the currencies and economies of the German states on July 1, when
East Germany became a free market after four decades of socialism.
   East German joblessness since has skyrocketed as factories
collapse in the face of Western competition.
   The document includes an important provision meant to lure more
Western companies into East Germany.
   Tens of thousands of West Germans who fled what is now East
Germany after the Soviet invasion of World War II have filed claims
on their former property.
   The uncertainty of who owns what in East Germany has been blamed
for inhibiting Western investment needed to provide jobs and
replace the dying sectors of the East German economy.
   The treaty gives Western investors who buy East German land
protection from any claims made by former owners or their heirs,
who would instead be compensated with cash under a system to be
worked out later.
   On the abortion question, East Germany will be allowed to retain
its abortion-on-demand law until at least 1992, deadline for a
united parliament to write a new law for the entire nation.
   The nations also agreed the new Parliament will decide what to
do with the files compiled by the notorious secret police, which
kept sensitive information about millions of people.
   In the meantime, the files will remain in what is now East
Germany under the custody of a West German official to be chosen by
East Germany.
   In a related matter, the West German Cabinet on Friday decided
to grant amnesty for small-time East German spies who operated in
West Germany, although it exempts those who are found to have taken
part in murders, threats or other nefarious activities.

   The State Department said on Friday that an
autopsy conducted with an American doctor present confirmed that an
American banker died of a heart attack after being rounded up by
authorities in Iraq.
   But the department said the fact that a heart attack killed bank
executive James L. Worthington, 56, ``in no way diminishes the
inhumane treatment which may have contributed to his death.''
   ``He was clearly under stress,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, the
department's press secretary. ``He didn't have access to decent
medical facilities.
   ``We want to make clear to Iraqi officials that we hold them
responsible for the safety and well-being of all Americans,'' she
said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Worthington's family lives in New York state.

   Arab foreign ministers ended a two-day
emergency session Friday with a new condemnation of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait and a call for Iraq to immediately release foreign
hostages, conference sources said.
   Only 13 of the League's 21 members attended the emergency
meeting and only 10 of them were represented by foreign ministers,
reflecting the deep split that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has
created in the Arab world.
   Egypt's foreign minister, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, said the
resolutions would be announced at a news conference Saturday.
Sources close to the conference, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said five resolutions were approved.
   They called for the immediate release of all foreign hostages
held by Iraq, and for compensation to be paid to Kuwait for losses
resulting from the invasion, the sources said.
   Other resolutions call for all civilians to be well-treated and
compensated for losses; reiterate the League's condemnation of Iraq
for the invasion Aug. 2; and call for the return of the rule of
Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the sources said.
   No explanation was given for the delay in announcing the
resolutions. Foreign Ministry sources insisted it was only to allow
time for the resolutions to be translated into English and French.
   The state minister for Cabinet affairs in Kuwait's deposed
government, Abdel-Rahman Awady, expressed satisfaction with the
resolutions but refused to elaborate.
   At an emergency Arab summit held in Cairo on Aug. 10, a dozen
members condemned Iraq and agreed to send Arab troops to Saudi
Arabia. So far only Egypt, Syria and Morocco have sent contingents.
   It was those same 12 states, plus Libya, that accepted Egypt's
invitation for the latest emergency meeting.
   On Thursday, the League secretary-general, Chadli Klibi, told
reporters the ministers had reviewed reports on efforts by some
Arabs to defuse the crisis. Klibi emphasized that any plan had to
include the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait
and the restoration of Sheik Jaber as ruler.
   He was apparently referring to a reported initiative by the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which Kuwait has rejected. The
PLO plan envisages a federation between Kuwait and Iraq in which
the emirate would be the junior partner.
   Other Arab states including Libya, Jordan and Sudan are involved
in diplomatic moves.
   A six-nation committee comprised of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Libya and Kuwait drafted the resolutions and presented
them to the ministers Friday.
   In addition to Iraq, League members boycotting the meeting
because of their varying levels of support for President Saddam
Hussein were Jordan, Sudan, Yemen, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania,
the PLO and Iraq.

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan sent Congress
on Friday a preliminary outline of a plan that will change the way
physicians are paid by the Medicare program.
   The package includes a preliminary fee schedule covering about
1,400 physician services, shifting payments to primary care and
away from procedure-based services like surgery.
   Under the new system, physician fees will be based on the time,
skill level and resources needed to perform the service, as well as
practice costs and malpractice insurance costs.
   More than 500,000 physicians will be affected by the change
scheduled to be impelemented Jan. 1, 1992. It will be the largest
change in the Medicare program since its inception 25 years ago.
   In his letter to health committee and subcommittee chairmen and
ranking members, Sullivan cautioned that the numbers in the fee
schedule are ``very preliminary ... Many and perhaps all of these
values will change.''
   ``Important policy and technical questions ... are unresolved,''
he said.
   Under the current Medicare system, physicians are paid their
actual charge, customary charge or the prevailing local charge for
a service, whichever is lowest.
   The system has resulted in large variations in payments among
localities and services.
   The new system will pay physicians either the actual charge or a
fee based on the value scale, whichever is lower.
   A geographic adjustment will account for differences in practice
costs, but overall payments will increase for many physicians in
rural areas who are paid less than urban physicians under the
current system.
   A spokesman for the American Medical Association said the
group's officials were looking over the preliminary fee schedule
but could not comment in detail on the proposal yet.
   The information was to be published in the Federal Register soon.

   A military jury Friday acquitted a
veteran paratrooper on charges that he unnecessarily killed a
Panamanian during the 1989 invasion of the country.
   The jurors deliberated nearly two hours before returning
clearing Master Sgt. Roberto Bryan. The verdict was greeted by
applause from other soldiers in the courtroom.
   Bryan sighed with relief. He had no immediate comment but a news
conference was scheduled for after the courtroom proceedings ended.
   Bryan, a 19-year Army veteran and member of Fort Bragg's 82nd
Airborne Division, was charged with unpremeditated murder. A
conviction would have carried a sentence of life in prison.
   The defense rested its case Thursday. The Army said Bryan, 42,
shot a Panamanian with his M-16 rifle without provocation during
the invasion.
   Two soldiers testified Thursday they drew their guns on the
unidentified Panamanian who was later killed by Bryan at an
American checkpoint following a grenade explosion on Dec. 23. They
said they viewed the man as a threat.

   German leaders on Friday signed a treaty to
reconcile their legal and constititutional differences before unity.
   Here are the main points of the 900-page unification treaty:
   _East Germany will avail itself of Article 23 of the West German
Constitution to join its larger neighbor Oct. 3.
   _West Germany's Constitution takes effect in what is now East
Germany on the day of unity.
   _Berlin is designated the capital of a united Germany. The
decision on the location of the all-German Parliament and the seat
of government will be determined after unification.
   _The 6 million files compiled by the Stasi, the former East
German secret police, are to remain in East Germany for now. The
all-German Parliament is to decide on their future disposition.
   _The all-German Parliament is required to pass a new abortion
law to reconcile the two vastly different rules that now exist in
the two states. Each country retains its laws until the new rules
take effect.
   _The two states recognize the inviolability of borders and the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states in Europe.
   _Under a previous agreement, West Germans are allowed to claim
property in East Germany that was seized from their families by the
Communists or lost when they fled to the West. Under the treaty
signed Friday, anyone who buys land in East Germany for development
purposes is protected from claims by previous owners or their
heirs. There will be a system worked out later to compensate people
who don't get their land back because it is being developed
commercially or because their claim would displace people living
there.
   _Treaties and agreements of the European Economic Community take
effect on the former territory of East Germany immediately after
unification.

<HEAD>Klansmen Who Want to Wear Masks May Do So in Saturday Rallies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 white supremacists are
expected in two northeast Georgia cities for marches and
demonstrations Saturday, and they may hide their faces thanks to a
court ruling throwing out a 1951 anti-mask law.
   Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers has advised state law
enforcement officials not to enforce the law against Ku Klux Klan
masks and most other concealments in public areas.
   The law was overturned in May by a judge in Gwinnett County; an
appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court is pending.
   ``Since the law has been declared unconstitutional and not been
clarified by the Supreme Court, there is a possibility that
officers would be open to civil rights actions if they enforce
it,'' Bowers said.
   Bowers, as attorney general, advises only state agencies. But
local police in Gainesville, where Saturday's largest demonstration
is planned, said they won't try to stop masked Klansmen, either.
   ``It's going to be our decision to adhere to the attorney
general's decision,'' said Gainesville Police Capt. Marion
Darricott.
   A year ago, about 280 Klan members, skinheads and other white
supremacists demonstrated in Gainesville. Officials of the Center
for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta group monitoring Klan activity,
expect a similar number this year, said center Executive Director
Daniel Levitas.
   The demonstration was planned by the Invisible Empire Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, but literature this week targeting minority
neighborhoods around Gainesville indicated that other Klan factions
and white supremacists also would participate, Darricott said.
   Klan members have a permit for a morning march and rally in
downtown Gainesville. Downtown streets will be cordoned off, and
businesses agreed to close for the morning to avoid the activities,
Darricott said.
   The enhanced security for this year's events _ tighter than a
year ago _ comes ``because of prior Klan activity in this area,''
the captain said.
   Only police and news media representatives will be allowed
access to the supremacists' march and rally. Spectators and
counterdemonstrators will be restricted to a designated space near
the courthouse, he said.
   The Center for Democratic Renewal is planning two rallies in
Gainesville in opposition to the white supremacist activities: a
morning ecumenical prayer service at a Baptist church and a noon
``community unity'' rally at an apartment complex. The locations
are away from the downtown KKK activities.
   After the Gainesville march and rally, some Klan demonstrators
are expected in Lawrenceville, about 30 miles away, for a
courthouse rally.
   That courthouse is where Klansman Shade Miller was arrested last
year in his one-man challenge of the state's Klan mask law.
   Gwinnett State Court Judge Howard Cook declared the law
unconstitutional in May, agreeing with Miller's contention that the
law violated Klansmen's First Amendment right to anonymous free
speech and expression.
   Klan members also plan an annual cross-burning ceremony Saturday
night at Stone Mountain on the property of longtime Klan leader
James Venable, according to Klan watchers at the Center for
Democratic Renewal.

<DATELINE>BROCKVILLE, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman's heirs have prevented the
Rev. Billy Graham's organization from receiving part of her $3
million estate, saying a fundraiser for the TV preacher used undue
influence to get the elderly woman to change her will.
   Under the terms of a pre-trial settlement approved Tuesday by a
surrogate court in Brockville, the family will split the estate
with a charitable foundation set up in the woman's name.
   Jessie Latta died in September 1988 at age 93 and left most of
her estate to the Jessie Latta Foundation, of which Carl Green, 63,
was a director.
   Green was also a fundraiser for the Minneapolis-based Billy
Graham Evangelistic Association. Another $100,000 was left to the
Graham association.
   Green could not be reached for comment Friday and the
Minneapolis office of Graham's association was closed Friday
afternoon.
   Latta's great-nieces and nephews did not know Latta had changed
her will until she had died. Her previous wills left the estate to
the family.
   The family claimed Green, of Ontario, worked his way into
Latta's life and become a close confidant.
   ``It was so obvious there was some kind of influence,'' said
Dianne Hickling, one of the four family members who contested the
will.
   Lawyers for the family produced Green's weekly reports on his
visits to Latta, beginning in late 1976. They outline Latta's
growing dependence on Green and his certainty Latta would leave a
lot of money to the association.
   Handwritten comments by Green's superiors in the margin of his
reports praise his progress, saying ``stay close to her'' and
``very good prospect.''
   At one point, Green described his visits to Latta as a
``cultivating job.'' As Latta grew increasingly infirm, she began
to watch religious television shows, including Graham's crusades.
Green's visits became more frequent.
   Tuesday's settlement split the $3 million estate equally between
six family members and the Latta Foundation. Hickling has replaced
Green as a foundation director.
   The family is considering going to court to retrieve about
$750,000 Latta gave the association.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices at Farm Drop in August, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products declined
1.3 percent from July to August, but the overall commodity price
index was still 3.4 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   Lower prices were reported for hogs, grapefruit and corn. Higher
prices for cattle, eggs and milk offset part of the decline for the
other commodities, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said in its preliminary report.
   Beef cattle prices were at a record level, and milk prices set a
record for the month of August.
   Most prices are mid-August averages which will be revised next
month. For example, the latest report showed July prices rose 0.7
percent instead of being unchanged as the report indicated a month
ago.
   No new figures were released to show how much farmers pay to
meet expenses. Those are adjusted quarterly, and last month's
report showed the prices-paid index was up 0.5 percent from April,
when the previous estimate was made.
   Meanwhile, department economists say consumer food prices are
going up 5 percent to 7 percent this year, compared with 5.8
percent in 1989, the most since 1981.
   A new forecast this week put 1990 net cash income of farmers at
a record in the range of $59 billion to $63 billion, up about
one-tenth from last year. The previous high was $57.2 billion in
1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   Another method, taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year, shows
that 1990 net farm income may be in a range of $47 billion to $52
billion, compared with $47 billion last year.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the August price index for all
crops was down 3.1 percent from July and 1.6 percent below a year
earlier. Both wheat and feed grains were down from July, while
soybeans were up.
   The August index for livestock and products was up 0.6 percent
from July and 8.1 percent above the year-earlier average.
   ``Compared with July, higher prices for beef cattle, calves,
milk and eggs more than offset lower prices for hogs and
broilers,'' the report said.
   Milk prices rose 30 cents in August to an average of $14.40 per
l00 pounds. That was up $1.20 from August 1989. The farm price of
milk rose to a record $16 per hundredweight in December before
easing down and then beginning the current climb.
   Vegetable prices rose 6.8 percent from July and were up 2.9
percent from a year earlier. Lettuce and tomatoes led the August
gains, while lower prices were reported for celery and sweet corn.
   Fruit prices were down 11 percent from July and 1.1 percent
below a year earlier. Grapefruit led the August plunge while apples
and strawberries were higher.
   Wheat prices, pressured by a bumper harvest, dropped 20 cents

$3.74 per bushel.
   Corn, at $2.46 per bushel, was down 16 cents from July but was
still 19 cents more than in August 1989.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $75.40 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $73.60 in July and $69.70 in August 1989. Those
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $56 per 100 pounds, down from $60.80 in July but
above the average of $45.60 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.46 a bushel, was down from $2.62 in July but was up
from $2.27 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.59 per bushel, compared with $2.79 in July and $3.74 a

<HEAD>Agency to Form Special Team to Prevent Fraud in S&amp;L Sales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Resolution Trust Corp. plans to hire a
special group of employees to watch for possible corruption as it
sells hundreds of failed savings and loans, an agency spokeswoman
said Friday.
   The RTC hopes to set up a team of 20 to 30 ``contractor cops''
this fall, spokeswoman Kate Spears said. The team, which will
oversee the sale of billions of dollars of S&amp;L assets, will be led
by a new assistant director of the RTC to be named in the near
future.
   ``We're going to be hiring people to work nationwide,'' Ms.
Spears said.
   Regulators are haunted by the specter of S&amp;L fraud, since abuse
by some thrift operators was partly responsible for the collapse of
hundreds of institutions in recent years. It will cost U.S.
taxpayers an estimated $500 billion to pay for the bailout of the
federally insured thrifts.
   In June, after weeks of criticism by Democrats, President Bush
announced with great fanfare that he was doubling government
spending on investigating and prosecuting S&amp;L fraud. Bush
established ``rapid response teams'' of investigative lawyers and
accountants to be directed by a Justice Department official.
   ``We need to put those people in jail and call them to account
for their conduct,'' the official, James G. Richmond, told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. Richmond, formerly the U.S.
attorney for northern Indiana, was appointed to the new position of
special counsel for financial institution fraud.
   In addition to fraud by S&amp;L insiders, regulators also are
sensitive about allegations of abuse stemming from their own
efforts to clean up the mess. Democrats in Congress have accused
the regulators of making sweetheart deals with outside buyers of
failed thrifts.
   In a highly publicized case, Congress has been investigating
investor James Fail for his purchase of 15 insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls,
now known as Bluebonnet Savings Bank, with $70 million in borrowed
money and only $1,000 in personal funds.
   To help prevent future abuses, the RTC's new ``contractor cops''
will coordinate their efforts with the agency's inspector general,
John Adair, Ms. Spears said.
   ``It looks to us like the opportunities for fraud are going to
be enormous,'' Adair told The Washington Post. He was not
immediately available for comment Friday, RTC spokesmen said.
   The new RTC team will keep an eye on the various contractors
hired by the agency to sell thrift assets and manage them until
they are sold. The new watchdogs will watch for kickbacks, rigged
bids and other forms of fraud involving the assets repossessed by
failed S&amp;Ls, which range from office buildings, hotels and
condominium developments to car washes and golf courses.
   Since the S&amp;L bailout bill became law a year ago, the RTC has
taken over 475 ailing institutions.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, an agency of the Treasury
Department, said Thursday that at least 246 additional S&amp;Ls are
expected to fail and are likely candidates to be taken over by the
RTC.

   An 18-year-old University of Florida
freshman charged with beating his grandmother was held on $1
million bond Friday, and police investigating the deaths of five
students sealed his apartment.
   Task force investigators refused to say whether he is considered
to be among the potential suspects in the slayings.
   ``At this particular time, we continue to have a pool of
suspects,'' said Alachua County sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann. ``To
say that we have a prime suspect or prime two suspects or three
suspects is very premature.''
   Edward Lewis Humphrey was arrested Thursday at his grandmother's
house in Indialantic, some 180 miles to the southeast, and charged
with aggravated battery on a person over age 65, authorities said.
   Two Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents spent 12 hours
Thursday at the jail in Sharpes where Humphrey was held, and
Brevard Circuit Judge Dean Moxley increased Humphrey's bond from
$10,250 to $1 million about an hour before the agents left early
Friday. The agents returned to the jail Friday.
   Brevard County sheriff's spokeswoman Joan Heller said Humphrey's
first court appearance initially scheduled for early Friday
afternoon was delayed for security reasons.
   ``He's a single-cell prisoner, meaning that he's considered
violent,'' she said.
   About 600 law enforcement officials are involved in a hunt for
the killer, who investigators have called a ``methodical maniac''
with a sick grudge against petite brunettes with shoulder-length
hair.
   Authorities have said they are interested in an Ohio fugitive
wanted in a mutilation slaying there. Mann said police also were
looking for a man wearing camouflage pants who ran away when a
state trooper tried to question him in Gainesville early Friday.
   Investigators are interviewing or watching three or four other
potential suspects in central Florida, police said.
   The victims _ students at either the University of Florida or
Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville _ were stabbed to death
in off-campus apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday.
Police said three of the four women were mutilated.
   Gainesville police sealed off Humphrey's apartment Thursday and
questioned anyone attempting to enter the property, about three
miles west of campus.
   ``We have investigators interested in that location. We have
task force members who are interested in the area,'' said Lt. Sadie
Darnell, a police spokeswoman, but she refused to say whether any
search warrants had been sought.
   Police at the scene wouldn't talk about what they were doing
there, but a part-time maintenance man at the complex said
authorities had not entered Humphrey's apartment _ No. 131.
   ``They're just watching it to make sure nobody goes in and takes
anything out,'' said Joe Lotz, the maintenance man and a University
of Florida senior.
   At Humphrey's apartment complex Friday, six detectives wearing
rubber gloves and green smocks combed through six garbage bins and
removed some undisclosed items.
   ``In this kind of investigation, it's important not to overlook
any possible kind of trace evidence,'' police investigator Gary
Manning said.
   Humphrey had been under surveillance since Tuesday when the
latest two victims were found at the Gatorwood apartment complex.
He lived in Gainesville over the summer but was evicted from
Gatorwood, The Orlando Sentinel reported.
   A Florida Department of Law Enforcement plane followed Humphrey
as he drove Wednesday from Gainesville to his grandmother's home.
Neighbors said he had experienced emotional problems since
suffering a severe head injury in a traffic accident more than a
year ago.
   Funeral services were held Friday for four slaying victims in
their hometowns _ Christina Powell, 17, of Jacksonville; Christa
Hoyt, 18, of Newberry; Tracy Paules and Manuel Taboada, both 23 and
of suburban Miami.
   The killings unleashed a wave of fear in this college town,
exacerbated by published reports that the killer stole flesh from
some of the mutilated victims and placed a decapitated victim's
head on a shelf. Police have given few details about the
mutilations.
   Hundreds of students fled the school earlier in the week, and
others skipped class to extend their Labor Day weekend.
   Larry Humes, a university spokesman, said: ``I think a lot of
people headed for the beach. It's probably a desire for suds and
surf as much as it is fear.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Encourages Guamanians to Vote Against Pro-Choice
Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fight to keep abortion legal on Guam is
being overshadowed in Saturday's primary elections by the
possibility that the U.S. territory may have its first woman and
non-native governor.
   Gov. Joseph Ada is unopposed on the Republican ballot as he
seeks a second term.
   Democrats face a choice between Sen. Madeleine Z. Bordallo, a
native of Minnesota and widow of Guam's former governor, or former
Lt. Gov. Rudy Sablan. The winner will face Ada on Nov. 6.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral legislature unanimously approved a
bill virtually banning abortions March 8 after Archbishop Anthony
Apuron threatened in a television interview to excommunicate any
Roman Catholic senator who voted against it.
   Ada signed the bill into law, saying: ``In my heart, I believe
that a fetus is a human being.''
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson struck down the law
as unconstitutional. Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to Guam.''
   Ada has not indicated whether he will seek an appeal.
   Mrs. Bordallo has said she also opposes abortion.
   Ada said he's running on his record of the past four years. He
said he is confident he and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Frank Blas,
will win re-election.
   On Jan. 31, Mrs. Bordallo's husband, Ricardo, chained himself to
a statue, wrapped himself in Guam's flag and shot himself in the
head. That occurred less than four hours before he was to fly to
Los Angeles to begin serving a four-year prison term for witness
tampering and obstruction.
   Ada defeated Bordallo in the 1986 election after Bordallo had
been indicted on the federal charges.
   Mrs. Bordallo wants to be Guam's first woman governor and the
first governor who is non-Chamorro, the name for native Guamanians.
   ``Women are moving ahead today. They are leading countries.
Right next door, we have a housewife leading 60 million people,''
said Mrs. Bordallo, referring to Philippine President Corazon
Aquino.
   Some 130,000 people life on Guam, an island about 1,500 miles
east of the Philippines.
   Mrs. Bordallo, 57, came to Guam in 1948 when her father accepted
a position as principal of George Washington High School here.
   Sablan, 58, served as Gov. Bordallo's lieutenant governor from
1974 to 1978, unsuccessfully challenged Bordallo in the Democratic
primaries in 1978 and 1982.
   Sablan, who also opposes abortion, said one of his priorities as
governor would be to set up a territorial tax structure that is not
tied to the federal tax system.
   The archbishop issued a pastoral letter published in newspapers
this week calling for voters to vote down pro-choice candidates.
   ``Like a modern day Pontius Pilate, a legislator or official may
attempt to wash his or her hands of abortion,'' Apuron said.
``However, the legislator cannot wash away the blood of the
innocents he or she has consciously declined to protect. Nor can
the voter sit idly by in apathy.''

<TEXT>
   A University of Connecticut student
whose mother turned him into police was sentenced Friday to five
years in prison for drug dealing, despite her tearful pleas for
leniency.
   ``He wants to deal with his problem,'' Jean Terrazzano of
Madison said of her 21-year-old son, Stephen M. Russo. ``He
realizes he could be dead now. Please give him a chance to get
treatment.''
   Superior Court Judge Richard Damiani said Russo gave up his
chance to avoid prison when he was arrested while the original
charges were pending.
   ``That's why you are going to prison today _ because you are a
drug seller,'' Damiani said. ``It makes no difference whether
you're from a suburb or a city ghetto, you're a drug seller.''
   Russo, who was to begin senior year next week, was sentenced to
10 years in prison, suspended after five years, and three years'
probation.
   Clean-cut and wearing a blue suit, Russo looked more like the
law student he wanted to be than the drug dealer Damiani said he
was.
   ``All I can said is I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering I
inflicted on my family and other kids,'' Russo said, weeping. ``But
I can't turn back time. I'm sorry for what I've done.''
   Terrazzano called police to her home on June 26, 1989, and
officers found Russo with 27 grams of heroin and 7{ pounds of
marijuana, court records show. They later found $85,000 in his
safety deposit box.
   In March, New Haven police arrested Russo after finding him with
broken fingers, an injured ankle, a cut scalp and 65 packets of
heroin.
   Russo's lawyer, Hugh F. Keefe, said Russo continued to sell
drugs because New York drug dealers were threatening his life over
money he owed them.
   Russo accepted a plea bargain in July to all charges pending
against him, pleading guilty to two counts of possession of heroin
and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to sell.
   Terrazzano had said she hoped her son would receive treatment,
not a prison term. She blamed herself for Russo's problems. His
father died when Russo was only a year old and she immersed herself
in her legal career.
   Damiani said Russo's difficult childhood could have contributed
to his becoming an addict. ``But I don't think your mother can be
blamed for your becoming a drug dealer,'' Damiani said. ``That's
greed.''
   Damiani said Russo had a choice to make in prison.
   ``You can say, `My mother put me here and the judge is a bum,'
'' Damiani said. ``Or you can be strong and be a man and reflect on
what you've done and come out of prison a productive person.''
   As her son was led out of the courtroom, Terrazzano sat in the
courtroom sobbing as she leaned on the bench in front of her. Her
husband, Joseph Terrazzano, tried to comfort her.
   Outside court, she said that given the same circumstances she
would call the police again. ``What other choice did I have?'' She
said. ``I'm just thankful he's still alive.''

   U.S. officials said that doubts about effectiveness of economic
sanctions in forcing Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait have prompted
recommendations from inside and outside the government for direct
U.S. military action against Iraq.
   President Bush's spokesman publicly dismissed such reports,
though military and other officials acknowledged that American
forces still pouring into Saudi Arabia could switch quickly from
defense to offense if so ordered.

<TEXT>
   An increasingly frustrated NASA will
try again to launch Columbia on Wednesday if a broken electronic
part used for one of the telescopes aboard the shuttle can be
repaired easily.
   Workers entered the shuttle cargo bay Friday to try to find
what's wrong with an electronic box at the base of an X-ray
telescope, one of four in the mission's $150 million Astro
observatory.
   The space agency late Thursday called off a scheduled Saturday
launch after spending the day fruitlessly trying to communicate
with the telescope inside the shuttle's cargo bay. The broken part
is believed to have caused the loss of contact.
   It was the second time the Columbia countdown had been halted.
The first launch attempt, in late May, was scrubbed because of a
hydrogen fuel leak.
   The last space shuttle mission was in April; the current lapse
is the longest between shuttle flights since the hiatus following
the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   ``Any time we get close and don't go, like a kid going to the
carnival, we're frustrated and we're anxious to get going,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. ``But we're
not going until we're ready. I think we're getting awfully close to
ready.''
   The latest problem appears to involve a line driver, a component
of the electronic box, which routes electrical power and telemetry
between the orbiter and the X-ray telescope, said Lennard Fisk,
NASA's chief scientist. If that is the case, a cable can be easily
installed to a second line driver in the unit, he said.
   The launch will be delayed until Friday or Saturday, however, if
the entire electronic box has to be replaced, Fisk said. NASA
expects to know the extent of the problem by Saturday afternoon.
Columbia's seven astronauts plan to remain at Kennedy Space Center
until then.
   ``We're calmly taking our time, and when it's ready, we're going
to go fly,'' Lenoir said.
   Saturday's launch also had been threatened by a problem with a
mid-deck instrument that measures acceleration and vibration, said
launch director Bob Sieck. The instrument failed to activate
properly during the countdown and probably will have to replaced.
   Four astronomers aboard Columbia will operate Astro's three
ultraviolet telescopes during the nine- to 10-day flight. The
observatory will probe some of the hottest objects in the universe,
including a comet and a supernova.
   The latest delay is not expected to affect Astro's observing
schedule, Fisk said. But it is the latest in a series of
embarrassments for NASA.
   Atlantis' classified Pentagon mission was delayed from July to
November after the shuttle was found to be leaking hydrogen, and
the entire three-shuttle fleet temporarily was grounded.
   In addition to the leaking shuttles, the space agency has spent
the summer contending with the Hubble Space Telescope's flawed
mirror and the occasional loss of contact with the Venus-orbiting
Magellan spacecraft.
   NASA had hoped to launch nine shuttle flights this year. Only
three have gone, the last one being Discovery's trip in April with
Hubble.
   Discovery is scheduled to be moved to another launch pad on
Sunday to await an October flight with the sun-probing Ulysses
satellite. Columbia has until Sept. 14 to lift off, otherwise it
will be forced to wait until after Discovery's flight, Lenoir said.
   NASA must launch Discovery between Oct. 5 and 23 to take
advantage of the alignment of Earth, the sun and Jupiter, whose
gravitational field will slingshot Ulysses back to the sun. The
next opportunity for launch will not be for another 13 months.
   As far as the leaks, Lenoir said the launch team is confident of
Columbia's new hydrogen lines.
   He also said it now appears Atlantis has the same type of leaks
as Columbia. Engineers initially believed Atlantis' leaks were in a
different place than the ones on Columbia.
   NASA will rely more on visual evidence of hydrogen leaks during
fueling for future flights and use different criteria for sensors,
Lenoir said.

   Liberian rebels have killed 200
foreign civilians from the five nations that make up a West African
task force in Liberia, the Ghana News Agency said Friday. The
killings came in retaliation for the force's presence there, the
agency said.
   A Ghana News Agency correspondent with the West African force
said rebels loyal to Charles Taylor began attacking the civilians
shortly after the troops debarked in Monrovia on Aug. 25 to try to
end the 8-month-old civil war.
   Taylor opposes any intervention in the conflict.
   No immediate response came Friday from Taylor, who confirmed on
Thursday that he was holding thousands of foreign citizens.
   The task force fought its way to the eastern edge of Monrovia
and took control of the capital's airport, diplomatic sources said
in Freetown, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The air strip is big enough to handle military transport planes.
Controlling it will make resupplying the force much easier.
   About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Gambia are under orders to end the conflict, which turned into
a tribal war.
   The Spriggs Payne Airfield had been in the hands of President
Samuel Doe's troops but was under fire almost daily from Taylor's
rebels, camped less than a mile away.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said a spokesman for Prince
Johnson, who broke with Taylor and leads a rival rebel group,
called Friday to report Doe's troops broke an informal truce and
attacked Johnson's men, killing 21 of them.
   Doe and Johnson had both welcomed intervention by the West
African force and declared a truce more than a week ago.
   The task force pushed eastward toward the embassies of three
member states _Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria _ which lay just behind
rebel lines. The rebels had rounded up thousands of Guineans,
Ghanaians and Nigerians who had taken refuge at their embassies,
saying they were being held for their own protection.
   The Ghana News Agency quoted Ghanaians who it said escaped the
attack, and said thousands more were waiting outside Monrovia's
port for a ship that would take them home.
   Ghanaian teacher Kwasi Kwateng, 36, said rebels attacked a
community of 2,500 Ghanaians living in Barnesville, about 3{ miles
from Monrovia's port.
   The agency gave no specifics about this or other alleged
attacks, however, and there was no confirmation from other sources.
   Kweku Egyir, 52, a Ghanaian who has lived in Liberia since 1963,
said Taylor's men were looking for Ghanaians and Nigerians in
particular because their members of the African force had inflicted
many casualties on the rebels.
   Egyir said the rebels could identify Ghanaians and Nigerians by
their accents and tribal scars. ``The marks on our faces are called
identity cards in this country,'' he said.
   Few details emerged on the fighting. The task force easily
repulsed several attacks by Taylor's men. using its heavy artillery
and armored cars, according to Nigerian and Ghanaian correspondents
traveling with the force.
   Taylor invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, calling Doe's
government corrupt and pledging to overthrow it. His fighters
quickly overran most of the West African country of about 2.5
million people, but were stopped on the outskirts of the capital.
   Johnson, who split with Taylor in February, led his men through
swamps on Monrovia's northern outskirts in a surprise attack on
Doe's troops. Johnson's rebels took control of much of the capital
city of about 400,000 Liberians, but were unable to drive Doe from
his heavily fortified mansion.
   U.S. Marines stationed on warships off Liberia evacuated
Americans and some other foreigners from Monrovia. Marines also
remained posted around the U.S. Embassy. But Washington says U.S.
forces will not intervene in the fighting, which has killed about
5,000 people, mostly civilians.
   The West African group said in sending its task force that the
Liberian conflict concerned their nations because their citizens in
Liberia were involved and because 400,000 Liberian refugees are
straining the resources of neighboring countries.

<HEAD>Cambodia's Government Gives Nod to U.N. Peace Plan</HEAD>

   In a major breakthrough in Cambodian
peace talks, that country's government said Friday it is ready to
accept as a basis for discussion a U.N. proposal already approved
by the guerrilla resistance.
   The announcement capped four days of progress in efforts to
reach a settlement of the 11-year-old civil war. On Tuesday, the
United States and four other permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council proposed a U.N. interim administration with five key
Cambodian ministries placed in its hands during the transition.
   In New York, U.S. officials tried Friday to win Vietnam's
approval of the U.N. plan. However, Vietnam, which installed the
Cambodian government in a 1978 invasion and remains its main
backer, was noncommittal.
   The State Department has said it is linking Vietnamese
cooperation on Cambodia with the possibility of normalizing
relations with the United States. In July, the United States,
nervous about battlefield gains by a Communist rebel faction, said
it was ending diplomatic recognition of the guerrilla alliance and
opening talks with Vietnam on ending the war.
   On Friday, a Cambodian official said his government ``accepts a
major role played by the United Nations during the transitional
period, notably the right to organize free and fair elections.''
   ``I think that it (the U.N. plan) could constitute a basis for
the discussions among the Cambodian parties,'' said Hor Nam Hong,
the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign affairs, in remarks
carried by the official Cambodian news agency and monitored in
Bangkok.
   The five permanent U.N. Security Council members have said up to
20,000 U.N. employees would be sent to shore up the truce and guide
the Southeast Asian nation to democracy.
   The Communist Cambodian government of Prime Minister Hun Sen is
battling a guerrilla coalition composed of the Communist Khmer
Rouge and two non-Communist groups, one headed by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and the other by Son Sann.
   The United States has supported the two non-Communist rebel
groups and China has armed the Khmer Rouge.
   When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, it ended a nearly
four-year Khmer Rouge reign in which hundreds of thousands of
people died in execution chambers and slave labor camps.
   Hor Nam Hong said his governemnt was ready for peace talks
anywhere, anytime. He said talks scheduled to take place soon in
Jakarta, Indonesia, should finalize the composition of a Supreme
National Council, establish where and when it will meet, and
discuss the U.N. peace plan.
   However, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Friday in
Jakarta that he was unsure if the session would occur because of
unclear signals from the Cambodian government. He said he expected
a definite answer from Cambodia within three days.
   Alatas said the Jakarta meeting, if held, should take place in
the first two weeks of September.
   In June, Hun Sen and Sihanouk agreed to form a Supreme National
Council to arrange a truce and play a role in the period before
elections. But the Khmer Rouge has rejected the agreement,
demanding that it be given the same number of seats on the council
as Hun Sen's government.
   The guerrillas want either the council or the United Nations as
the interim government, while Hun Sen wants to retain power during
the transitional period. He had said earlier the U.N. role
generally should be limited to organizing elections.
   In his remarks, Hor Nam Hong said his government agreed that
``certain important ministries'' could be temporarily supervised by
the United Nations.
   The United States has supported the two non-Communist rebel
groups and China has armed the Khmer Rouge.
   The Security Council plan would entail the United Nations' most
extensive peacekeeping effort.
   The plan covers arrangements for running Cambodia during the
pre-election period, a temporary military setup, elections under
U.N. auspices, human rights protection, and international
guarantees that Cambodia will be non-aligned and democratic.

   The fine print in a Republican
fund-raising campaign that has sent $25 checks to 700,000 people
nationwide is under investigation by attorneys general in at least
two states.
   On the back of the $25 check, the fine print says the recipient
authorizes the bank to transfer $12.50 out of his account each
month to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
   Oregon's Attorney General, Dave Frohnmayer on Friday urged the
committee to halt the campaign. Minnesota Attorney General Hubert
H. Humphrey III said his office also is investigating the campaign.
   Frohnmayer, a Republican, was asked Thursday to investigate the
matter by Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, his Democratic
opponent in the governor's race.
   ``As I'm sure you will agree,'' Roberts wrote, ``this mailing is
an unconscionable attempt to exploit the vulnerability of people
who cannot read fine print, or who for some other reason may not
succeed in deciphering the real purpose of the mailing, and who
will, as a result, suffer financial hardship.''
   Frohnmayer concurred.
   ``This fund-raising gimmick by the National Republican
Senatorial Committee is a bad idea,'' he told The Associated Press.
``While our professional staff pursues the consumer protection
aspect, I will urge the national committee to pull it. It's bad
public policy and it's bad politics.''
   In Washington, D.C., GOP Committee spokeswoman Wendy Burnley
said the program is explained on the check and the accompanying
letter. She said electronic bank transfers _ or Candidate Escrow
Fundraising, as the letter describes them _ have become routine and
aren't confusing.
   ``We have a good deal of faith in the American people that they
will open this up, read the letter and will understand it,'' she
said. ``There's absolutely no possibility whatsoever for people not
to realize what they are doing.''
   She said the letter includes a toll-free number for people to
call for more information or if they want to cancel membership in
the program. She also said the committee will give refunds to
anybody who asks.
   Burnley said the committee's lawyers approved the campaign. The
solicitation accompanying the check urges people to call the
committee at the end of two months if they want to stop the bank
transfers.
   The letter, which the committee sent under the name ``Republican
Presidential Task Force,'' says the money will ``give our incumbent
and challenger candidates the extra edge they'll need this November
to defeat liberal Democrats who oppose President Bush.''
   Besides, those who participate in the program will be included
in ``Who's Who in the Republican Party.'' The letter said the bank
transfer program will allow the committee to reduce mailing,
administrative and postage costs.
   It's the third mailing this year to draw criticism for the
Republicans.
   In February, similar checks were sent to several thousand
people. The fine print on those checks said the $12.50 monthly
charge would go up by 10 percent a year. The new checks omit that
provision and provide the toll-free number.
   The committee also was criticized for a July fund-raising
campaign in which it asked 500,000 people asking for at least $9 to
cover processing for an ``Official 1990 National Voter Data Card''
included in the mailing.
   Sharon Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Federal Election
Commission, said a number of election officials and recipients of
the mailing complained they were ``confused and concerned because
they thought they had to pay to vote.''
   Frohnmayer spokeswoman Marla Rae said the current solicitation
will be examined to determine whether it violates laws governing
trade practices and charitable solicitations.
   She said she contacted the committee Friday to pass along
Frohnmayer's advice.
   ``As with any solicitation of this sort, we urge folks to make
sure they know what they are signing,'' Rae said. `` If a recipient
of the letter has any qualms whatsoever, don't sign or deposit the
check.''

   The Iraqi government is adding new and
confusing layers of bureaucratic red tape to delay the promised
departure of American women and children, the State Department said
Friday.
   ``The Iraqis insist on stringing this out and putting all of
these innocent people through this cruel ordeal,'' said Margaret
Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman. ``Every time we think we
have figured their demands out, they change them.''
   But Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat said Iraq was
arranging the departure of Americans and other Westerners in ``an
organized fashion,'' and that Ms. Tutwiler's accusations are
``absolutely not true.''
   ``We are in an emergency situation and we have our own
priorities,'' al-Mashat told reporters who questioned him after he
was summoned to the State Department. ``The priority is to protect
the country.''
   The news media, he said, is casting Iraq's actions in the worst
possible light.
   ``They are forgetting that Iraq is being held as a hostage and
that the threat is against Iraqis,'' he said.
   The government of President Saddam Hussein has confirmed that
his pledge to permit the departure of women and children applies to
people in occupied Kuwait as well as those Iraq, she said.
   However, the nearly 3,000 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait have been
divided into categories, each with a different exit requirement,
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She declined to say what the categories are because of the
changing nature of the requirements.
   ``The information that we have is so convoluted and confusing
that it would be unfair to put the information out at this time,''
she said.
   Dividing the American and other foreign hostages into categories
comes on the heels of other newly created Iraqi exit requirements.
   Under the new government orders, all those wishing to leave must
write letters expressing their intentions, have the letters
translated into Arabic and obtain official government stamps
certifying that all Iraqi taxes have been paid.
   Ms. Tutwiler said five more Americans had been rounded up by
Iraqi authorities. One American woman was granted an exit visa and
was allowed to leave for Amman, Jordan.
   The United States has asked for permission to send a charter
aircraft to Baghdad to evacuate Americans but has received no
response, Ms. Tutwiler said. Further reports have been received of
Americans escaping Iraq on their own, she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Joseph Wilson, the highest ranking diplomat at
the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, was told Thursday he could meet with
Americans held at a hotel.
   But he was not allowed to enter the hotel when he arrived, she
said, adding that a consular officer was later permitted to speak
to 14 American women and children at the hotel.
   ``All of the women and children that we saw seem to be well and
had their passports,'' she said.
   Wilson was allowed to visit the hotel Friday morning after
lodging a protest with the Iraqi foreign ministry. He met with
three Americans _ one man and two women.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Wilson was told the U.S. Embassy should submit
the passports of all Arab-born American men with the passports of
all American women and children.
   But she said that when a U.S. official took the travel documents
to an Iraqi government office, ``he was told there had been a
change and was sent away.''

   Former defense consultant Mark Saunders
was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined $5,000 Friday for
his role in funneling military procurement data to a defense
contractor.
   Saunders was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan
Jr. for his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal that is the
subject of a longrunning Justice Department investigation dubbed
``Operation Ill Wind.''
   The investigation has resulted in nearly 40 convictions of
Pentagan officials, consultants and executives of defense firms as
well as several corporations.
   Saunders, 56, was convicted June 5 of conspiracy to defraud the
government, wire fraud and conversion of government property.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. ordered that Saunders,
56, be placed on two years of supervised release after completing
the prison term.
   The former Navy procurement official who became a defense
consultant was convicted of participating in a scheme to funnel
secret Pentagon bid information to another defense consultant, who
sold it to Norden Systems, according to trial testimony.
   Saunders obtained the information from former Navy procurement
official George G. Stone, who pleaded guilty to participating in
the scheme, and passed it along to defense consultant Thomas E.
Muldoon.
   Muldoon then sold the bid information about the sophisticated
Marine Corps radar and communication system to Norden Systems, one
of several companies competing for the $100 million contract,
according to testimony.
   Three Norden executives have already pleaded guilty to taking
part in the operation.
   Muldoon, who was convicted last year of unrelated defense fraud
charges, was indicted along with Saunders. But the charges against
Muldoon were dismissed by a judge who ruled that prosecutors may
have indicted him as punishment for appealing the earlier ``Ill
Wind'' conviction.
   Stone testified that he kept Norden in the competition for the
contract at the request of Saunders. Norden dropped out of the
competition after the ``Ill Wind'' investigation became public two
years ago.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blamed Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein on Friday for the ``very dangerous'' situation in
the Persian Gulf, but noted his nation still favors a diplomatic
solution.
   ``We have to understand that an escalation of a military
confrontation is always fraught with unpredictable consequences,''
he said. ``That is why we have to act responsibly, all of us, to
prevent a large-scale military conflict. I believe this is our
common goal, and we are promoting this idea.
   ``Only those who think illogically can reject such a solution.
And I include the president of Iraq in that ... It makes the
situation explosive, very dangerous.''
   He rebuked assertions that the Kremlin's lack of military
presence in the gulf indicated a slip in the nation's world status.
   ``Some people think we lose our prestige and reputation. It is
not so,'' he said. ``I think that everything will depend on whether
we are successful in using political measures.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Belonogov told a parliamentary
committee Thursday that ``there are no guarantees'' the United
States will remove its troops from the gulf region if the conflict
is settled, according to the state news agency Tass.
   And the Soviet commander of the Warsaw Pact military alliance,
Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov, also warned that U.S. forces in the gulf
would alter the global strategic balance.
   But Gorbachev said the U.S. deployment in Saudi Arabia was
permissible under the U.N. charter, and said he believed its troops
would eventually withdraw.
   ``I believe that when a solution has been found, we will be able
to provide guarantees,'' he added. ``And I believe that the sooner
we have a military detente after that, the more calm we all will
feel.''
   Although the Soviet support for military action in the gulf has
been lukewarm, not since World War II has the nation cooperated so
fully with the U.S. and other Western nations during a world crisis.
   The Soviet Union voted in favor of a U.N. Security Council
resolution authorizing the use of force to impose sanctions against
Iraq, but balked at joining a U.S.-led naval blockade.
   The Kremlin quickly halted its arms shipments to Iraq, but it
has not withdrawn 193 Soviet military specialists and 5,000
construction workers stationed there under contract with the Iraqi
government.
   It pulled its diplomats out of Kuwait after Iraq ordered foreign
governments to close their embassies. The United States and several
other countries have defied Iraq's mandate.

<TEXT>
   Scientific organizations from eight countries
have signed an agreement to found a committee for cooperation and
information exchange in research on the north polar region.
   The groups, all from countries with territories in the Arctic
zone, formally agreed this week to found a non-governmental
organization to be called the International Arctic Science
Committee, the National Academy of Sciences said Friday.
   Signing the agreement were organizations from Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Soviet Union and United
States. The founding articles were signed at a remote scientific
outpost in Resolute, Canada.
   The National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. organization that
signed the agreement, will help coordinate the research of
countries that maintain active arctic science programs and help
integrate arctic studies with the research on the global
environment.
   Membership in the IASC is open to all countries with significant
arctic science programs, group said in a statement. Representatives
from four other countries had observers at the meeting.
   Improved relations between the East and West and a greater
importance given to arctic cooperation between the Soviet Union and
the United States were ``decisive factors'' in reaching the
agreement, the statement said.
   Scientific interest in both the north and south polar regions
has grown in recent times because of concern about global warming.
The statement said changes in the Earth's average temperature
caused by the so-called greenhouse effect are expected to be
greatest in the polar areas.
   Experts believe that global warming could lead to shrinkage of
the polar sea ice fields, the thawing of permanently frozen soils,
melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and a worldwide rise in the sea
level.
   Arctic conditions also influence global weather patterns and
ocean circulation, the statement said.
   Organizations signing the agreement were: the Academy of
Finland; the Danish Commission for Scientific Research in
Greenland; the Icelandic Council of Science; the Interdepartmental
Committee on International Science and Technology Relations of
Canada; the Norwegian Academy of Sciences and Letters; the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences; the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences; and
the National Academy of Sciences.

<HEAD>Environment Minister Seeks Urgent Check Of Chernobyl Safety Cover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer
said Soviet authorities should urgently check the concrete safety
cap encasing the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The Soviet plant was the site of the world's worst atomic
accident, a 1986 fire and explosion that spewed radioactive cesium,
strontium and plutonium over a wide area of the Ukraine,
Byelorussia and Russia.
   A reactor at the plant was shut down Monday, the Soviet
government newspaper Izvestia reported earlier this week.
   ``There is certainly an urgent need to precisely pursue and
examine the present condition of this security cover,'' the
respected newspaper Die Welt quoted Toepfer as saying.
   On Thursday, the Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk radio station
quoted unidentified Soviet ``experts'' as saying they feared the
reactor floor could give way from the weight of concrete slabs and
release huge amounts of radioactivity.
   According to Deutschlandfunk, the Soviet experts said the only
solution may be to tear down the concrete encasing and build a new
one.
   Izvestia gave no further details on the shutdown of the No. 3
reactor at Chernobyl. It said ``established safety standards were
not violated.''
   In the Die Welt interview, Toepfer did not indicate whether
there was imminent danger.
   But he did urge the cover be examined, saying a leak ``could
lead to widespread contamination very quickly,'' the newspaper
reported.
   ``It (the cover) surrounds a massive inventory of radioactive
fission products,'' Die Welt quoted him as saying.
   Toepfer said his ministry is in contact with the Soviets about
Chernobyl.
   He also said the International Atomic Energy Organization in
Vienna and nations within the ``international partnership'' should
get involved in making sure Chernnobyl is safe, reported Die Welt.
   It was Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4 that caught fire and exploded
on April 26, 1986. Official reports say 31 people were killed in
the partial meltdown, but unofficial reports say 250 died. Four
years after the accident, more than 2 million people are still
living on contaminated lands in the region.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries.
   The plant is 80 miles north of the Ukraine capital of Kiev.

   Postal officials are red-faced about reports
that they want Americans to have a white Christmas.
   Not so, says Richard J. Strasser, senior assistant postmaster
general for marketing and customer service. Strasser's comments
came after postal officials in Kansas City told area residents
earlier this week that they should ``never use red, green or any
dark colored envelopes.''
   If people buy Christmas cards that come with envelopes that are
red or green or some other color, the Postal Service will deliver
them happily, Strasser said Friday.
   Americans send one another some 2 billion cards annually,
millions in colored envelopes.
   White envelopes are easier for the agency's automated machinery
to handle, Strasser admitted. Dark-colored backgrounds can make the
addresses written on them very hard to read.
   ``They are a challenge, but we can handle it,'' he said.
   How did the misunderstanding start? Some postal workers may have
been too enthusiastic in discussing the benefits of the new
automatic letter sorting equipment, Strasser said.
   Strasser said the postal service and the makers of greeting
cards have been working together to develop envelope colors that
are attractive but can easily be handled by automatic sorting
machinery.
   But in the meantime, no envelope that is sold will be rejected,
he said.

<HEAD>Report: No Solid Evidence Linking Cancer to Three Mile Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study found that people near the Three
Mile Island nuclear power plant have a higher risk of some cancers,
but saw no solid evidence that radiation from the plant's 1979
accident was a factor, its authors said Friday.
   The study, which reviewed hospital records of 160,000 people
living within 10 miles of the plant, also found no significant
relation between exposure to radiation during the accident and
childhood cancers or leukemia.
   The study, which used data from 1975 through 1985, appears to
corroborate previous government reports which found no detrimental
health effects linked to the accident, which damaged the Unit 2
reactor and led to a $1 billion cleanup.
   ``Overall, the pattern of results does not provide convincing
evidence that radiation releases from the Three Mile Island nuclear
facility influenced cancer risk during the limited period of the
follow-up,'' the study concluded.
   But two authors of the report, Columbia University
epidemiologist Maureen Hatch and Three Mile Island Public Health
Fund investigator Dr. Jan Beyea, acknowledged that some findings
showed increased cancer risks. They said those risks did not appear
linked to the accident.
   For example, there were 34 cases of lymphoma cancer in 1984-85
other than Hodgkin's disease. That indicated a twofold increase in
the risk for residents who were living in the areas north and west
of the plant, where the highest radiation doses occurred at the
time of the accident, the report said.
   But previous studies have not linked lymphoma cancer with
radiation, even in high doses, the report pointed out.
   The study was funded by a $700,000 grant from the health fund,
which was established by a 1981 court order to pay for the study of
public health issues related to the accident. The findings were
published in the September issue of the American Journal of
Epidemiology.
   The study also found there were 1,529 total cases of cancer,
excluding lung cancer, from 1975 to 1979. That figure jumped to
2,391 from 1981 to 1985. Ms. Hatch said the disparity might have
been caused by faulty record-keeping at hospitals, which were just
beginning to computerize records in the mid-1970s.
   Another increase in risk was noted for lung cancer, but the
report concluded that ``an effect of plant emissions in producing
the unusual patterns of lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
appears unlikely and alternative explanations need to be
considered.'' The effect of smoking was one explanation cited for
lung cancer.
   The report was greeted with skepticism by some members of the
community around TMI, located about 10 miles south of Harrisburg on
an island in the Susquehanna River.
   Kay Pickering, a spokeswoman for Three Mile Island Alert, a
citizens group, said a more exhaustive study was needed before
residents could be sure their health was not affected.
   Marjorie M. Aamodt, who helped conduct a 1984 survey of
residents in the area, said the study should have included clinical
examinations of people who suffered illnesses at the time of the
accident.
   A 1985 state Health Department study, the first of its kind
after the accident, found no pattern of increased cancer cases or
deaths, but did turn up isolated instances of higher-than-expected
cancer cases in several communities downwind from the plant. The
new study dismissed those cases as statistically insignificant.
   A 1984 survey, conducted by Mrs. Aamodt and her husband, found
cancer deaths up to seven times higher than expected in sections of
Newberry and Fairview townships near the plant. The Health
Department judged that survey invalid because it appeared to focus
on streets where cancer victims lived.
   There are about 2,000 lawsuits pending against the owners of TMI
for alleged health effects stemming from the accident.
   The accident occurred after a combination of human and
mechanical errors allowed protective cooling water to drain from
the reactor. Some of the reactor's uranium fuel rods melted, and
radioactive gases and particles were released to the environment.
It was the worst accident at a commercial nuclear power plant in
the United States.

   Iraq's foreign minister said Friday his
country ``has no intention of igniting the explosive situation''
and all foreigners in Iraq could leave if the United Nations could
produce guarantees against military attack.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz spoke after emerging from his second
meeting of the day with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   ``If such guarantees are provided then the situation of the
foreigners would be resolved,'' Aziz said.
   ``Iraq doesn't have any intention of igniting the explosive
situation'' in the Persian Gulf, he said.
   Perez de Cuellar called the talks a ``step forward.''
   He said he welcomed Iraq's earlier decision to let Western women
and children go free. But, he said, that was not enough. He did not
comment on Aziz's call for guarantees against attack by the West.
   Aziz, asked later if progress was made to defuse the crisis,
told The Associated Press, ``Inshallah,'' Arabic for ``God
willing.'' Then he added:
   ``You should advise Mr. Bush to withdraw his troops from Saudi
Arabia.''
   Aziz and Perez de Cuellar emerged smiling after five hours of
talks and agreed to meet again Saturday after experts discussed
specific points. They seek to settle the regional crisis set off by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   Their long-awaited talks created such a stir that one reporter
was pushed into a hotel lobby pool in the news media's crush to
approach them.
   Iraq has been holding an estimated 21,000 Westerners, including
3,000 Americans. It said Tuesday women and children would be
allowed to go free but men must remain.
   Iraq's U.S. ambassador, Mohammad al-Mashat, said all foreigners
could leave if America gave assurances that the U.S.-led
multinational force in the Persian Gulf region would not attack
Iraq.
   A senior Jordanian source, who had access to both sessions,
called Friday's talks an excellent meeting with ``so many positive
points.''
   He said both sides were optimistic about resolving the military
standoff but a political settlement could be thorny.
   ``Iraq insisted on the conviction that there should be a
comprehensive peace solution for all Middle East crises,'' said the
source, a ranking official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Aziz touched on this at a news conference, denouncing a ``double
standard'' against Arabs. He said the Palestine question, Lebanon
and other problems must be linked to talks on Kuwait.
   Perez de Cuellar replied when asked if he would go to Baghdad to
see President Saddam Hussein: ``That is not in the cards.''
   The U.N. chief made clear upon his arrival in Amman Thursday
that his negotiating room was scant. He said his role was defined
by U.N. resolutions.
   The Security Council cut off Iraq with economic sanctions and
then, pressed by President Bush, gave Western warships a vaguely
defined right to enforce it.
   U.N. members unanimously condemned Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
   The secretary-general said Friday that Iraq's release of
foreigners ``would very much help to lessen the tension in the
area,'' but that a solution to the complex situation could not be
expected in a day of discussions.
   Aziz made a similar point.
   ``Pushing for speedy, dramatic things is not the only, or the
best, way,'' he said. ``Let us not forget the age of this crisis is
only days. You cannot resolve this by magical solutions. We must
find patience and we need some quiet diplomacy.''
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters that because the first session
was useful the second session was arranged with the U.N. and Iraqi
delegations present.
   Aziz, standing next to the secretary-general, said he was happy
to meet ``an old friend. . . . We have confidence in him.''
   The two men got to know one another during long negotiations for
a peace treaty to end the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. A U.N.-brokered
cease-fire stopped the fighting in August 1988.
   Friday's meetings were at the royal palace in Amman. King
Hussein meantime flew to London from Madrid on a 10-nation search
for peace in the region.
   Attention focused on a diplomatic solution as both Iraq and the
multinational force aligned against it sought to back away from war
threats. But both sides held firm in their declarations of resolve.

   More than 1,000 mourners, led by Bonnie Raitt,
Jackson Browne and Stevie Wonder, sang a bluesy version of the
ancient hymn ``Amazing Grace'' on Friday at a graveside service for
blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan.
   The singer's fans, some dressed in black, some in T-shirts from
his concerts, and some wearing replicas of Vaughan's trademark
black felt hat, stood in the sweltering heat for as long as three
hours.
   Vaughan, 35, died Monday in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin
after headlining a concert Sunday night with Eric Clapton and
Robert Cray.
   Vaughan's mother, Martha Vaughan, was accompanied by her older
son, Jimmie Vaughan, the founder of The Fabulous Thunderbirds, and
by Stevie Ray Vaughan's fiancee, Janna Lapidus. Ringo Starr was
there, as were members of ZZ Top.
   Mourners began arriving before 10 a.m. for the noon graveside
service, and their numbers swelled steadily. By the start of the
service, fans were lined up nine and 10 deep outside restraining
barriers across a road from the burial site. They heard the
services over a public address system.
   Stevie and Jimmie Vaughan had just completed an album, ``Family
Style,'' set for release in September. Producer Al Rogers played a
cut, ``Tick Tock,'' from the album at the service.
   Many in the crowd got teary-eyed during the song, and applause
and whistles broke out when it ended. ``I'm glad you applauded,''
said presiding minister Barry Bailey. ``That was appropriate.''
   More applause followed the blues-style version of ``Amazing
Grace'' near the end of the half-hour service.
   ``We grew up with him in Oak Cliff,'' said Pat Beam of Grand
Prairie.
   A friend, Neoma Mayo, said: ``He taught her brother to play the
guitar, and we loved him dearly. I appreciate the family sharing
this with us. He's given all of us so much.''
   ``When he was playing the guitar, you sometimes found yourself
caught up more in what he was doing than in your own thing. He was
always fun to play with,'' said Damien Womack, 36, a drummer who
performed with Vaughan.

   More than 50,000 supporters of the
fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood marched through Amman streets on
Friday demanding holy war against ``U.S.-Zionist aggression'' on
Arab soil.
   A Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Owaidah, told them, ``The Jews,
the West and the East, together with the powers of disbelief want
this nation to remain under the mercy of the Jews!''
   Demonstrators chanted slogans, including, ``Humiliation and
indignity for America's new lackey, the Soviet Union!''
   The Moslem Brotherhood embraces hundreds of thousands of Arabs
in the Middle East and North Africa. Chapters in each country
operate independently, but often coordinate on policy.
   The Brotherhood blamed the Persian Gulf crisis, which arose
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, on a conspiracy between the
United States and Israel, with tacit help from the Soviet Union, to
colonize Arab lands for the control of oil.

<HEAD>2 Charged for Shooting of Prosecutor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two people were charged Friday with shooting to
death an assistant prosecutor who happened into the line of fire in
a drug turf battle one block from the courthouse where he worked,
police said.
   Jose Diaz, 21, and Ernesto Garcia, 16, were each charged with
second-degree murder, second-degree attempted murder and criminal
possession of a weapon.
   Police said Sean Healy, 30, an assistant district attorney in
the Bronx, was buying doughnuts at a grocery store Thursday and
happened to be standing in the line of fire when three men in a car
pulled up and fired seven or eight shots. Healy was struck once in
the back.
   At a news conference Friday, Police Commissioner Lee Brown said
the shooting of Healy was the result of a fight over drug turf.
   The commissioner said Diaz fired the shots from a 9mm automatic.
Garcia's role wasn't known.
   The shooting took place just blocks from Yankee Stadium in a
drug-plagued neighborhood of the Bronx where robberies and thefts
are common. In his novel ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' author
Tom Wolfe paints the area as so dangerous that even prosecutors
fear for their own safety.
   Healy was appointed to the district attorney's office on Jan. 16
and was assigned to Bronx Criminal Court, where prosecutions
generally involve minor charges which result in jail terms of a
year or less, said Steven Reed, a spokesman for District Attorney
Robert Johnson.
   Also Thursday, a former state senator, 49-year-old Vander
Beatty, was fatally shot in his office in the borough of Brooklyn.
   Beatty, a Democrat who left the state Senate after being
convicted of forgery and racketeering in 1984 and served 19 months
in prison, was shot once in the head at his office. Police said he
was killed by an unidentified man who drove away.
   The car the gunman used was found parked a few blocks away from
Beatty's re-election headquarters. Detectives were trying to find
the car's owner, Arthur E. Flourney, 51, a retired Corrections
Department captain, said police Officer Ralph St. Just.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen, one
group loyal to Iran and the other to Syria, battled in this eastern
Lebanon town on Friday. Police said 12 were killed and 39 wounded.
   Fighters of the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the more secular Amal, Arabic for ``hope,'' traded grenade attacks
on each other's command posts in and around Baalbek, setting them
on fire, police reported.
   ``The town is burning. Houses and gasoline filling stations are
ablaze,'' said a police spokesman.
   He said the town's 150,000 inhabitants huddled in basements or
fled to neighboring fields as the fighting with machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades raged from sundown Thursday to dusk
Friday.
   Syrian troops in charge of Baalbek's security massed in battle
formations around the town, apparently bracing to intervene to
quell the fighting, the spokesman added. Syrian forces control most
of Lebanon after intervening under a 1976 Arab League mandate.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Amal have been
battling on and off for the last three years to lead the 1.2
million Shiites who make up the largest sect among Lebanon's 4
million population. By police count, at least 1,094 people have
been killed and 3,218 wounded in the power struggle.
   It was the first time the two factions engaged in such ferocious
fighting in Baalbek, the largest Shiite urban center in east
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley 38 miles east of Beirut. The main sites of
previous fighting were in southern Lebanon and Beirut's southern
slums.

<HEAD>More Mohawk Barricades Lifted At Bridge to Montreal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohawk protesters on Friday allowed more
barricades to be dismantled at a Montreal bridge, but they kept up
their armed standoff in this town to the west.
   After a week of seesaw efforts to settle the 52-day land
dispute, the status of talks were unclear. A provincial go-ahead
for the Canadian army to take down barricades in Oka remained in
effect, but troops were apparently waiting in the hope a negotiated
settlement could be reached.
   The standoff began July 11, when the Quebec provincial police
attempted to storm a Mohawk barricade at Oka, 18 miles west of
Montreal. One officer was killed, but it is still not clear by
whose gunfire.
   The Indians are protesting a plan to expand a golf course on
land they claim as theirs. Later on July 11, fellow Mohawks set up
the blockade in sympathy at the Mercier bridge, a major link
between Montreal and its southern suburbs.
   On Friday, an army spokesman said work continued at the Mercier
bridge to remove barricades with the consent of Mohawks from the
local Kanewake reserve. By Friday afternoon, all the main
barricades on the five routes leading to the bridge were removed,
said army spokesman Lt. Francois Rousseau.
   ``There was a lot of co-operation and nobody was nervous. I'm
surprised to see the work going so fast,'' he said. ``For now,
things are running pretty smoothly.''
   Serge Forest, a Quebec Transport Department spokesman, said it
will be several more days before the bridge can be opened to
traffic.
   The local army commander, Lt. Col. Robin Gagnon, worked out an
agreement with Mohawk representative Jack LeClaire for both sides
to start tearing down the barricades there Wednesday. However,
Mohawks said Thursday that authorities were harassing them, and
work was abruptly halted.
   The bridge blockade has forced thousands of commuters on the
south shore of the St. Lawrence River to make long detours to
Montreal, which is on an island. Angry residents have protested and
thrown rocks at Mohawks.
   At Oka, armed and masked Mohawks stayed behind their barricades
Friday. But only two or three members of the Mohawk Warrior's
Society lounged in lawn chairs or on the grass there, chatting with
reporters and ignoring the army down a hillside 100 yards away.
   Army Maj. Richard Larouche said he had indeed received orders to
tear down the barricades, but he said no deadline for action was
set.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa has cut off the broader talks
between Mohawks and officials to end the standoff, but Mohawk
spokesman Jerry Pelletier said Friday the Indians were ready to
resume them.
   The Canadian minister of Indian Affairs, Tom Siddon, said the
federal government was talking with the Mohawks.

   The White House said Friday it had
``nothing to announce'' on speculation that President Bush would
meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev next week.
   ``We're looking at a lot of things. We have nothing to
announce,'' said Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater when asked
if there was any substance to the speculation.
   He refused to elaborate or to say if any announcement might be
forthcoming later.
   Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, is due back on Saturday from
a week-long trip to Moscow. He and several top White House aides
had accepted an invitation from Gorbachev to visit the Soviet Union
and explain the technical workings of the executive branch in
Washington as Moscow revamps its own political structure.
   Earlier, Fitzwater's deputy, Roman Popadiuk, had dismissed the
matter out of hand when The Associated Press approached him Friday
afternoon with a rumor out of Moscow that Bush and Gorbachev would
meet Sept. 8 in Helsinki.
   Popadiuk said then there was no substance to the rumor ``as far
as I know.''
   Popadiuk later told the AP, ``We have nothing to announce.''
   There was no word on whether Sununu may also have been involved
in discussions on an upcoming potential meeting between Bush and
Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Deny Oxygen Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts who made emergency repairs outside
their damaged spacecraft said Friday that the job demanded a cool
head, but they denied earlier reports they had risked running out
of oxygen.
   The 179-day mission by Alexander Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin, which ended with their return to Earth on Aug. 9, is
expected to show a $21 million profit, the deputy mission chief
said. He said it is the first in the 33-year history of the Soviet
space program.
   The two cosmonauts walked in space for seven hours on July 17 to
repair insulation surrounding the space capsule that would take
them back to Earth. Before finishing the repairs, they discovered a
problem with the porthole leading back to the orbiting space
station Mir, forcing them to return through an emergency hatch.
Soviet media reported their life support supplies were running
dangerously low by the time they returned to Mir.
   Solovyev told a news conference Friday each cosmonaut had 10
hours of oxygen in their main tank, plus reserve supplies.
   ``We consumed only two-thirds of our main balloon of oxygen ...
so we had reserves,'' he said.
   He said the spacewalk was one of the hardest moments of the
mission, but that cosmonauts train for such crises.
   ``I'm sure that men who are not prepared, who do not expect such
situations, will not cope with it,'' Solovyev said. ``In that
situation, we were quite calm, even cold-blooded, if I may say so,
about the decisions we were taking.''
   The cosmonauts made a second space walk on July 26 to finish the
repairs and retrieve some equipment they left behind, attached to
the capsule's exterior.
   Deputy mission chief Viktor Blagov told the news conference that
the mission, the sixth to the orbiting space station, cost $134
million.
   But he forecast revenue of $155 million through the sale of
high-definition photographs of the Earth's surface and of pure
crystals developed in space for use in semiconductors and computer
chips.
   ``So from a program of scientific investigation, it is being
turned into a program for economic benefit,'' Blagov said.
   The Soviet space program, for decades a source of national
pride, has come under increasing pressure in recent years to prove
its worth as the country grapples with consumer shortages and other
economic woes.
   For the last two years, the program has suffered from docking
equipment malfunctions, mistakes by cosmonauts and budget cuts.
   Blagov said the space program will continue to put even more
emphasis on commercial activities.
   The Soviets have also agreed to take a paying customer into
space in December. Two employees of the Tokyo Broadcasting System
are vying for the seat.

   The American who died while being held
captive in Iraq was a banking consultant who had been in the middle
of his second year in Kuwait, relatives say.
   An autopsy, performed in Iraq with an American doctor present,
showed James L. Worthington Jr., 53, died of a heart attack, the
State Department said Friday.
   ``He didn't have high blood pressure, but he was at risk by some
other things,'' said Tim Neilson, son-in-law of the banker who
lived in Woodstock when he was not working overseas. ``He smoked
cigarettes and drank a lot of coffee.''
   Worthington had signed a second year-long contract as a
consultant for the Alahi Bank of Kuwait in January, relatives told
the Kingston Freeman.
   ``He was taken hostage in Kuwait and moved to Basra where he
died of a heart attack,'' said Worthington's daughter, Maggie Jean
Neilson.
   Worthington may have been moved to a strategic location near an
Iraqi oil field in the southern port of Basra as part of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's ``human shield,'' she said.
   ``Now that he's not coming home, we'll never really know what
happened,'' said Ms. Neilson, 27.
   She said her family had no reason to fear for her father's
safety, until the notification from the State Department of his
death.
   ``We'd get letters every week and Mom would have phone calls.
She could call there. There was a direct line,'' Neilson said.
``There was no indication of danger. He didn't feel any differently
about it than anyone else over there. They were all caught with the
same degree of suprise. ... We spent our whole lives overseas, so
it was just another post.''
   Before moving to Kuwait, Worthington worked for 28 years in
various foreign branches of Citibank. He and his family were
stationed in Colombia, Brazil, Liberia, Indonesia, Singapore,
India, and at the main branch in New York City just prior to his
tenure in Kuwait, Ms. Neilson said.
   ``We moved around every five years,'' she said.
   Relatives and friends told the Kingston Freeman they did not
want to divulge too much about what they learned about
Worthington's death.
   ``The reason nothing much is being said now is that we're at the
mercy of Saddam Hussein. The family won't speak to other media
because this is a precious personal thing. All the facts as of this
interview is all there will be,'' said Don Badgley, a family friend.
   The State Department said the fact that a heart attack killed
Worthington ``in no way diminishes the inhumane treatment which may
have contributed to his death.''
   ``He was clearly under stress,'' said Margaret Tutwiler, the
department's press secretary. ``He didn't have access to decent
medical facilities. We want to make clear to Iraqi officials that
we hold them responsible for the safety and well-being of all
Americans.''
   Worthington's wife, Katharine W. Worthington, was notified of
her husband's death by a phone call from the State Department on
Monday night, Ms. Neilson said.
   Mrs. Worthington and her mother, Katharine Rosen Warner, were in
seclusion at the family home in Woodstock, about 90 miles north of
New York City, she said.

<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Annexations, relatively low-cost housing
and a swelling immigrant population contributed to making Fresno
the quickest growing of the nation's top 50 cities over the past
decade.
   In 1980, there were 218,202 people in Fresno. The preliminary
1990 census figures push the population to 350,794 _ a 61 percent
growth rate in just 10 years. That boosted Fresno from the nation's
65th-largest city to 47th.
   Mayor Karen Humphrey said the numbers did not exactly surprise
her _ but they do present some challenges to the city in
California's central valley, about 180 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
   ``I think that this is a dynamic exciting community with a very
good lifestyle,'' she said. ``The rapidity of the growth challenges
us to preserve that quality of life.''
   Since 1980, the city has annexed 21,951 acres with 14,457
housing units. Beedle said. The estimated population increase from
the annexation is 38,300 people.
   Yet an even larger population shift in the city has come from
the influx of Southeast Asian refugees.
   ``Approximately 47,000 refugees have been absorbed,'' city
planner Donn Beedle said. ``That's a large chunk of people coming
in.''
   The refugees are attracted to Fresno by both the area's
agriculture and low housing costs, he said.
   ``A lot of these people know about agriculture, and they would
gravitate to an area that they could get jobs and property,''
Beedle said.
   Central valley towns traditionally also have attracted many
immigrants from Mexico and Central America.
   Another reason people come here is the attractive housing
market. While all of California's cities are growing quickly, it is
the valley communities that are the most affordable. Fresno's
average home costs around $100,000 compared to $250,000 in the San
Francisco or Los Angeles areas.
   Although the census data is only preliminary, Beedle said the
city is already rechecking the numbers to see if they tally with
city figures.
   ``Historically speaking, the census undercounts us,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The people of Sao Tome e Principe voted
overwhelmingly to back the West African nation's transition to
democracy, referendum results showed Friday.
   It was the latest in a series of moves in several African
nations away from traditional one-party rule.
   More than 81 percent of voters in the Aug. 22 referendum backed
a government-proposed constitution ending rule solely by the
Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome e Principe, said official
figures cited by Portugal's Lusa news agency.
   The archipelago has been ruled by the leftist party since
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The proposed constitution enshrines a multiparty system, a mixed
economy, an independent judiciary, freedom of expression and the
right to strike.
   Both the ruling party and fledgling opposition groups urged the
islands' 52,000 voters to approve the changes.
   However, 20.1 percent abstained from voting, according to
Friday's results.
   Recently, the movement has dropped much of its
Communist-inspired ideology. According to Portuguese news reports,
the ruling party is soon to change its name to the Social
Democratic Party.
   The National Assembly has already approved the new
constitutional text, which was drawn up by a Portuguese legal
expert.
   According to a Lusa report from island capital of Sao Tome, the
new constitution will come into force within the next few days. It
will be followed by laws authorizing the creation of new parties,
Lusa said.
   Multiparty elections are scheduled for the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole expressed ``strong reservations'' about the government's
human-rights record Friday but extended an invitation to Prime
Minister Petre Roman to visit Washington.
   The Kansas Republican, leading a delegation of seven senators on
an eight-nation, 11-day tour, told reporters Roman should have a
chance to ``talk to congressmen'' about the rights situation in the
country.
   State radio quoted Roman as responding that he would be ``happy
to go to the U.S. ... (to) hold a very open dialogue with all those
interested in Romania.'' He said such a visit would have
``exceptional importance.''
   The United States has strongly criticized the Romanian
government for its conduct during a June demonstration and its
aftermath.
   Six people were killed as police acted to end anti-government
violence. Thousands of miners, responding to a call by President
Ion Iliescu to help quell street opposition, subsequently
terrorized the capital for several days.
   Roman and Iliescu have been in power since the December
revolution that ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, first
on an interim basis, then as part of a democratically elected
government after their National Salvation Front scored an
overwhelming victory in May.
   Speaking after meeting with Roman, Iliescu, and opposition and
labor leaders, Dole said that ``We know there have been great
changes since last Dec. 22, but we think additional changes could
be made and should be made.
   ``We have strong reservations,'' he continued. ``Obviously
compared to Ceausescu anything in the world is better, but that
doesn't mean that it's the way it should be.''
   He said he was concerned about mass arrests made after
anti-government demonstrations, delays in issuing passports and the
continuing state monopoly over the mass media.
   Dole insisted that Congress will have to be satisfied that ``the
human rights record in this country is exemplary'' before restoring
Romania's Most Favored Nation trading status _ lost in 1988 _ and
allocating large-scale humanitarian and other aid.
   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York said he would probably
support restoration of the clause after being told by opposition
leaders here that they would welcome such a step.
   The Senate delegation also includes John Warner of Virginia,
Jake Garn of Utah, Steven Symms of Idaho, Don Nickles of Oklahoma,
and Connie Mack of Florida.
   They left for Czechoslovakia Friday. They already visited
Yugoslavia and plan stops in Italy, Bulgaria, Bahrain, Egypt and
the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>CDC Stops Monkey Breeding at L'ville, 2 Months After Heat Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control has
discontinued the research monkey breeding program at its suburban
Lawrenceville facility after 14 primates died there of heatstroke.
   The Atlanta-based CDC is keeping open the Lawrenceville research
station, which performs rabies research and raises other animals.
But 116 monkeys bred at the facility were shipped this week to a
federally funded primate center at Covington, La., CDC Public
Affairs Director Don Berreth said Friday.
   Fourteen rhesus monkeys died of heatstroke on July 9, after
handlers placed them outside to recover from anesthesia on a day
when temperatures reached 96 degrees.
   CDC researchers said the deaths were puzzling, as rhesus monkeys
are routinely found in hot areas of India and Asia.
   CDC's decision to phase out its monkey breeding program was made
before the heatstroke deaths, but ``it was clearly accelerated'' by
controversy over the deaths, Berreth said.
   With wider commercial availability of laboratory monkeys in
recent years, ``we simply no longer have the kind of need for
monkeys we had before,'' Berreth said.
   CDC officials said the July 9 mishap was the worst loss of
primates in the agency's history.
   The monkeys had been anesthetized so handlers could de-worm them
and test them for a primate AIDS virus and for tuberculosis. They
had not yet been placed into research projects.

   Five Chinese have been killed and thousands
forced from their homes by Typhoon Abe, the sixth major storm to
hit China's southeastern coast this summer, an official report said
Saturday.
   Abe, packing 100 mph winds, left two people missing and 15
injured in Taiwan before sweeping over China's Zhejiang province
Friday. It was headed northward toward Jiangsu province and
Shanghai, China's largest city, the China Daily reported.
   In addition to the five deaths, the typhoon caused widespread
damage and disrupted communications and power over a large area of
Zhejiang, it said.
   It said the typhoon was expected to cause substantial damage to
major harbors.
   China's southern coast already has been buffeted by five
typhoons this summer.
   Earlier this month, Typhoon Yancy swept through northern Taiwan
and killed 20 people before moving on to China's southern coast,
where it caused at least 216 deaths.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze left
Friday on a weeklong Asian tour to shore up relations with three of
the Soviet Union's neighbors.
   His first stop is China, whose Communist leaders have criticized
reforms initiated by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Shevardnadze will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in
the northeastern city of Harbin to discuss events in the Persian
Gulf, Cambodia and cuts in weapons and armed forces along the
5,000-mile Soviet-Chinese border.
   Gorbachev's 1989 visit to China, the first by a Soviet leader in
30 years, encouraged pro-democracy demonstrators camping out in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. A few days after Gorbachev's departure,
Chinese army troops crushed the movement, killing hundreds of
students and others.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev said Shevardnadze's visit
comes at a ``very critical period in international politics, when
tension in the Persian Gulf has come to a head.''
   ``The Soviet Union and the United States, for example, regularly
exchange views, whereas there are no regular consultations between
the Soviet Union and China,'' Rogachev told the official Tass news
agency. ``Therefore such consultations will be very important.''
   Shevardnadze said in a Tass interview before leaving Moscow that
the Soviet Union and the United States, as permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, ``bear certain responsibility'' for
resolving the crisis sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   On Sunday and Monday, Shevardnadze planned to visit North Korea,
a longtime Soviet ally that also has been critical of the political
changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The talks will focus on ``ways to lower military confrontation
on the Korean Peninsula'' and elsewhere in Asia, Shevardnadze told
Tass.
   North Korea, one of the world's last hard-line Communist
countries, is especially unhappy over Gorbachev's overtures to its
bitter enemy, South Korea. Gorbachev met with South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo in San Francisco in June and the two
countries have been working to establish diplomatic ties.
   Shevardnadze is scheduled to arrive Tuesday in Japan to resolve
what he called ``issues that have piled up for decades.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said he would lay the groundwork for
a visit by Gorbachev next year and push for a peace treaty formally
ending World War II.
   Relations between the two countries have long been strained over
Japan's demand that the Soviet Union return the Kuril islands, a
small chain off northern Japan seized by the Soviets in the last
days of the war. Moscow claims them historically as Russian
territory.

<HEAD>Secret Police Say Terrorism Decreasing in Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrorist attacks and murders around
Colombia have decreased sharply in recent weeks, according to a
report by the secret police published Friday.
   Officials have attributed the decline in violence to a
government crackdown on drug trafficking and peace talks with rebel
groups. ``In Colombia, there is a new climate of peace,'' Defense
Minister Oscar Botero told reporters earlier this week.
   The report published Friday said there were 321 murders in
Colombia during August, compared to 678 in June, according to El
Tiempo, the country's leading newspaper.
   The murders included street killings and domestic brawls, but in
the past Colombia's high murder rate has been attributed to leftist
guerrillas, right-wing death squads and drug traffickers.
   There were 21 terrorist attacks in August, down from 94 in
March, the report said.
   The report was presented to President Cesar Gaviria's
administration by the Department of Administrative Security,
Colombia's secret police, El Tiempo said.
   In July, the Medellin cocaine cartel, the world's largest
cocaine supplier, declared a unilateral truce in its campaign of
bombings and assassinations in response to the anti-trafficking
policy.
   In the 11 months before the cease-fire, drug traffickers were
blamed for killing more than 550 Colombians, including about 250
policemen and three presidential candidates.
   In a meeting Friday with senior government officials, Gaviria
said judges trying drug cases will be able to keep their identities
secret.
   In the past, drug traffickers have bribed or threatened judges
into releasing them. Judges who refused were often murdered.

   Three children, found at home alone,
hungry and dirty after their soldier-father was sent to the Middle
East last week were placed in a foster home Friday, officials said.
   ``The children are fine,'' said Charles Wilson, director of
child welfare for the state Department of Human Services.
   Two boys, 13 and 9, and their 12-year-old sister were without
food or hot water when they were found Wednesday at their home.
Their father, stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky., had been deployed to
Saudi Arabia, police said.
   The father, Staff Sgt. Faagalo Savaiki of the 501st Signal
Battalion, could face charges when he returns from military duty,
authorities said.
   Public Affairs officer Bill Harralson said Friday that Army
officials had not been able to reach Savaiki, who left Saudi Arabia
for American Samoa Thursday after learning that his mother was ill.
   ``We don't know if he's still en route or if he's at the
hospital,'' Harralson said. ``Once the emergency is over they are
directing him to return to the base instead of Saudi Arabia.''
   Harralson said the Army would not file charges against Savaiki
because it is a civilian matter.
   Police officer Joe Goff said the youngsters' mother divorced
Savaiki and returned to Hawaii three weeks ago. Police were called
in Wednesday night after a member of Savaiki's company checked on
the children.
   The children, who had been attending school, were alone in a
house almost bare of furniture, Goff said. They wore dirty clothing
because they hadn't learned how to do the laundry.
   Savaiki had tacked a note to a wall, explaining how to get money
out of the bank with an automatic teller card and telling the
children which bills to pay.
   ``They didn't have any money at the time. They hadn't bought
anything. There was nothing in the house for them to eat. The house
was quite a mess,'' Goff said.
   Wilson would not discuss the specifics of the case, but said
normally officials would try to locate relatives to care for such
children. ``We try to keep them in a similar environment,'' he said.
   Peggy Jones, a neighbor of the Savaikis, said she had seen the
children leaving for school and returning in the afternoon.
   ``Nothing looked wrong,'' she said. ``Bless their hearts,
they're good children. They always played well together. This is
just a complete shock to us.''
   Police notified the Clarksville-Montgomery County Humane Society
after finding a starving dog chained outside to a tree.
   Inside the house, a cat had given birth to kittens that had just
opened their eyes. The animals are now in the care of the Humane
Society.

<TEXT>
   The prime minister of North Korea will
visit South Korean President Roh Tae-woo next week in what is
viewed as a first step toward mutual recognition by the rival
nations.
   North Korean Premier Yon Hyong Muk will pay a courtesy call on
Roh during four days of talks with South Korean officials on easing
tension on the divided Korean peninsula, officials said.
   In their official declarations, capitalist South Korea and
Communist North Korea, bitterly divided since 1945, each claims
sole representation for the entire peninsula.
   The North Korean premier, accompanied by about 90 aides and
reporters, will cross the heavily armed border Tuesday for
unprecedented talks with his South Korean counterpart, Kang
Young-hoon. He is scheduled to return home Friday.
   The prime ministers' talks will be the highest level meeting
ever between the hostile nations. The meeting will focus on easing
more than four decades of military and political enmity.
   An official itinerary released Friday did not include any
schedule for Yon's courtesy call on Roh but government officials
said it will take place Thursday.
   In earlier working negotiations, the two Koreas agreed to hold a
second round of prime ministers' talks in the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang on Oct. 16-19.
   The prime ministers' talks in Seoul will be held at a luxury
hotel near the Olympic Stadium with about 3,000 police deployed for
security, officials said.
   South Korean officials attach great significance to the talks,
but longtime observers doubt that any substantial progress can be
made because the premiers of both nations are mostly figureheads
without policy roles.
   North Korea has said the talks should deal mainly with ways to
ease political and military tensions. South Korean officials insist
that priority be given to non-political exchanges to promote mutual
confidence.
   North Korea has proposed drastic arms reductions, cutting the
troop level of both sides to 100,000 each. North Korea has more
than 1 million troops, while South Korea has 650,000.
   The North Koreans also demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. But
South Korea opposes any drastic measures like arms cuts before an
extended period of confidence building.
   The two nations fought a three-year war in the early 1950s.
Their border is sealed without mail or direct communication.
   They have held talks on and off since the early 1970s but failed
to make major progress.

   Thousands of Armenians attended funeral services
Friday for a member of the republic's parliament and another man
who were shot this week, witnesses said. The shootings intensified
the the crisis in the republic.
   Crowds lined the streets of the capital, Yerevan, for the
funeral procession of slain lawmaker Viktor Aivazian and Gehavnik
Manukyan, said Raffi Hovannisian, Yerevan representative of the
Armenian Association of America.
   The deaths of the two men early Wednesday morning prompted the
Armenian parliament to declare a state of emergency later in the
day and to ban the Armenian National Army, which was blamed for the
shootings.
   The fighting in Armenia appeared to die down as members of the
banned Armenian National Army continued to surrender to local
authorities, the state news agency Tass reported.
   More than two dozen bands of the banned paramilitary
organization have turned themselves in, along with 50 automatic
weapons, the report said.
   The Armenian National Army was created last winter as a
vigilante group to protect the mostly Christian population of
Armenia from mostly Moslem population of Azerbaijan. The
neighboring republics have been battling for two years over
jurisdiction of Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enclave inside
Azerbaijan.
   Last week, Armenia declared idepedendence from the Soviet Union,
becoming the fifth Soviet repubic to do so. Azerbaijani
nationalists attempted to declare independence last winter, but
Soviet troops intervened and much of the republic has been under
virtual military rule since then.
   Although the Armenian National Army and the Armenian government
share many aims, they have been fighting each other.

   The Voice of America will begin
around-the-clock broadcasts to the Middle East next week, despite
Iraqi efforts to jam the programming, the government announced
Friday.
   The broadcasting service, an arm of the government's United
States Information Agency, is already beaming 9 3@4 hours daily of
broadcasting in Arabic to the region.
   Beginning Wednesday at 7 a.m. EDT, that will increase to 13
hours a day. The remaining 11 hours of programming each day will be
in English.
   ``In times of crisis we redouble our efforts to pierce the
information barriers surrounding closed societies,'' Voice of
America Director Richard W. Carlson said.
   Iraq is jamming Voice of America broadcasts to the Persian Gulf
with 500-kilowatt transmitters.
   To get its programming through, the Voice of America has been
sending its radio signals over short- and medium-wave frequencies,
varying them in an effort to evade the Iraqi jamming. It is also
sending audio signals that can be picked up by satellite dishes.
   The agency is beaming news programming, as well as State
Department advisories meant for Americans in Iraq and Kuwait.

<HEAD>Carbon Monoxide Exposure During Exercise Linked to Heart Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People with heart disease who exercise in
air laden with carbon monoxide are likely to suffer irregular
heartbeats, a precursor to sudden death, according to a published
study.
   The research, by the University of North Carolina and the
Environmental Protection Agency, expands on earlier findings that
even low levels of carbon monoxide are dangerous for the estimated
9 million Americans with heart disease.
   An editorial accompanying the report in Saturday's Annals of
Internal Medicine said the EPA's carbon monoxide regulations should
be better enforced rather than tightened.
   About one-third of the U.S. population, almost 78 million
people, live in areas that exceed the outdoor carbon monoxide
limits of 9 parts per million in eight hours or 35 parts per
million in one hour, the EPA says.
   Carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen by
binding to hemoglobin, a protein that ferries oxygen from the lungs
to the heart. The pollutant changes the protein's structure to a
form called carboxyhemoglobin, which can't transport oxygen.
   The average level of carboxyhemoglobin in non-smokers is about
1.5 percent, while the EPA regulations are designed to protect
against a 3 percent level.
   The study examined the heartbeats of 41 non-smokers with heart
disease who were exposed to two concentrations of carbon monoxide
before riding exercise bicycles. The study was designed to raise
the level of carboxyhemoglobin to either 4 percent or 6 percent, a
level commonly found in smokers.
   At levels of 6 percent, the number of multiple irregular
heartbeats during exercise was three times greater than normal, the
researchers found. The heart irregularities can lead to sudden
death.
   The researchers were surprised to find that the volunteers
showed little effect on their heartbeat at the 4 percent level,
said the lead author, Dr. David S. Shep of the University of North
Carolina.
   But Shep cautioned against politicizing the study's findings,
saying that previous studies found that men with blocked arteries
suffered chest pains while exercising when exposed to levels of
only 2 percent carboxyhemoglobin.
   ``The fact that we didn't find effects at 4 percent shouldn't be
taken to mean that we should liberalize our (air quality)
regulations,'' he warned.
   The editorialists, Dr. Sandra Walden and Dr. Sidney Gottlieb of
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said the study's
implications for environmental regulations are ``complex.''
   ``A simplistic solution may appear to be tighter restrictions of
automobile and other industrial emissions; however, without equally
serious consideration of enforcement issues, the effect of tighter
restrictions alone would be limited,'' they wrote.
   Gottlieb said it was ``frightening'' that low levels of carbon
monoxide can apparently be dangerous to so many people with heart
problems or heart disease.
   Jim Raub, a health scientist for the EPA, said the study will
contribute to a current evaluation of carbon monoxide regulations.
He said the study's results will add to the debate over whether
tighter restrictions are needed to protect more people.
   People who exercise outdoors _ whether afflicted with heart
disease or not _ should exercise early or late in the day to avoid
peaks in the air's level of carbon monoxide, and shun
traffic-congested areas, said Dr. Phillip Marone, director of
Thomas Jefferson University's Sports Medicine Center.

   While White House officials scrambled for
information during the initial hours of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
AT&amp;T's own crisis management center was plotting an escape for
dozens of employees.
   An undisclosed number of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
employees were among a group of U.S. nationals working in Kuwait
whose companies had security measures in place for such a crisis.
   ``Our security director was awakened about 3 o'clock in the
morning by our people in a location in Kuwait City,'' AT&amp;T
spokesman Herb Linnen said Friday from Washington.
   The security director and his staff had the crisis center went
into action in an hour, he said. Eighteen people have been staffing
it around the clock ever since.
   At the direction of the crisis center, carloads of company
employees in Kuwait City formed a caravan within a week of the
invasion, and confronted Iraqi tanks and soldiers on a 20-hour trek
through the desert to Saudi Arabia.
   The center, at an undisclosed location in northern New Jersey,
is a converted conference room stocked with computers, maps,
telephones and other communications equipment.
   ``Clearly our people in Kuwait City who were hearing reports of
violence against people were nervous,'' Linnen said. ``There were
reports of violence and of rapes.''
   A telephone line from Kuwait City to the crisis center in New
Jersey was left open until it was cut about 24 hours later.
   ``We kept the line open literally as a psychological lifeline to
those individuals,'' Linnen said. ``They wanted to have assurance
that AT&amp;T's top management was looking out for their interests.''
   AT&amp;T officials were in contact with other companies, he said,
including Chiquita Brands International in Cincinnati, Westinghouse
Electric Corp. in Pittsburgh, and Boeing Co. in Seattle.
   Linnen said more than 20 AT&amp;T employees fled Kuwait in two
caravans.
   Spokesmen from Westinghouse and Chiquita said they could not
comment on evacuation efforts or employees who may be in Kuwait or
Iraq.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the company had no employees
in Iraq and only two in Kuwait, who are still believed to be there.
   However, all three companies said they have procedures to take
care of overseas employees when and if trouble erupts.
   ``We have a crisis board that meets when something like this
happens, and they monitor the situation as best they can and are in
contact with various government agencies and other companies when
appropriate,'' Binder said.
   Families of Boeing workers in Saudi Arabia flew home Aug. 10
aboard a new 747-400 sent to evacuate them.
   In AT&amp;T's case, employees in Kuwait were given general
instructions for reaching safety. Specific plans were not
discussed, Linnen said.
   The workers formed a caravan about one week after the Aug. 2
invasion and headed toward the Saudi border, but were turned back
by Iraqi troops.
   ``It was a polite but a firm word that they couldn't pass the
checkpoint,'' Linnen said. ``So they went back and they tried again
and they got out.''
   A second caravan made it across the border a week later.
   Linnen said security reasons prevented him from discussing how
many people made it to Saudi Arabia or how many AT&amp;T employees are
still in Iraq or Kuwait. He also declined to identify the route the
employees traveled or whether it has since been closed.
   The center's last contact with AT&amp;T workers still in Iraq and
Kuwait was last week, he said.
   The crisis center was created about two years ago, he said.
   ``There was a recognition that in the world in which we live
there are regrettably situations that could plunge employees into
some kind of jeopardy,'' Linnen said. ``It was decided instead of
everybody scampering in different directions that there should be a
system to react when employees are put in harm's way.''

   Air force chief Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun said
Friday that Israel's air force is on alert following Iraqi threats,
and he urged the United States to ``remove the Iraqi dictator from
the stage'' if war breaks out.
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted as saying Israel
was not interested in getting involved directly in the Persian Gulf
crisis and was not giving advice to anyone.
   Bin-Nun, interviewed on Israel Television, was asked if fighting
between the United States and Iraq would help Israel.
   ``A violent confrontation is never good for anyone. But in this
case, apparently there is no other choice but to harm Iraq's
dictator in such a way that would keep the region quiet for a long
time,'' he responded.
   ``Any other action . . . that would not, in the end, remove the
Iraqi dictator from the stage, will in the long run harm us, and
the whole Arab world and the region.''
   The state-run television also broadcast an unusual report
showing training flights of a squadron of U.S.-made F-15 jets and a
special room where pilots engaged in computer analysis of mock air
battles conducted earlier in the day.
   Bin-Nun, interviewed in front of an F-15, said:
   ``The air force is on a high level of alert in order to give an
answer to any threat or any hint of a threat to Israel. It's on
alert every day of the year and especially in these days . . . It's
ready and continues to prepare itself for response to any threat
that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein dares to make.''
   The interview was broadcast a day after an unidentified Iraqi
air force commander threatened to respond to a U.S. military action
with ``smashing blows to the nests of the Israelis.''
   Shamir warned Saddam ``any aggressor would live to regret his
actions.''
   But he told visiting British parliamentarians of the Friends of
Israel group that Israel was determined not to become involved in
the crisis.
   ``He emphasized and re-emphasized that Israel had no interest
whatever in getting involved, that Israel was not giving advice to
anyone, that Israel would of course react if attacked, but it hoped
it would not be,'' Labor parliamentarian Greville Janner said on
Israel radio after a meeting with Shamir.
   An Israeli military source, who briefed reporters Friday on
condition of anonymity, said Israel believed Iraq was unlikely now
to initiate military action against the Jewish state but could do
so if attacked by U.S. and other forces from Saudi Arabia.
   He said the Iraqis may believe an attack on Israel would give
them widespread support by Arab nations, most of which have opposed
the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
   He added there was no proof Iraq could reach Israel with
missiles armed with chemical warheads.

   The Soviet Union is swiftly running out of
essential medicines, angering consumers already beset by shortages
of gasoline, tobacco and food.
   ``As early as next February, the country may run out of drugs
completely, because the pharmaceutical industry is crumbling even
more rapidly than the rest of the economy,'' Health Minister Igor
Denisov warned Thursday.
   ``We have already seen tobacco riots,'' the workers' newspaper
Trud commented. ``Shall we now prepare for aspirin riots?''
   Soviets are accustomed to permanent shortages of some goods,
such as winter boots and automobile parts, and occasional shortages
of many others, ranging from toothpaste to coffee.
   But as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have inched the
Soviet Union toward a market economy, the resulting inflation and
hoarding have worsened many of the perennial shortages and created
new ones.
   Drugs have never been plentiful, and Denisov said the industry
is falling further behind. He told Trud the country met 52 percent
of the domestic demand for medicine in 1985, but expects to meet
only 39 percent this year and 30 percent in 1991.
   In addition, the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda said Thursday that
Moscow faces a potential ``bread panic'' because bakeries are
unable to keep up with the spurt in demand as residents return to
the city after August vacations.
   Gasoline has long been rationed in some Soviet cities, and even
in Moscow supplies have rarely been ample. But the situation has
grown acute in recent days as car owners have made a run on gas
stations.
   The evening television news program Vremya said drivers were
reacting to rumors the Soviet Union may export more oil to take
advantage of higher prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, Vremya said people
were waiting in line all night to buy small amounts of fuel _ even
if it wasn't the right kind for their cars.
   ``Car owners are panicking,'' the announcer said as the
television showed people asleep in a line of cars.
   A tobacco shortage that began in early summer has fueled street
protests in half a dozen cities and rioting in Siberia. In Moscow,
where rationing will limit residents to five packs a month starting
Sept. 1, jars of cigarette butts are being sold by street vendors
for $16.
   ``What are we worth?'' a reporter for Trud wrote indignantly.
``I don't think there's another country in the world, much less one
that claims the title of a great power, where cigarette butts are
sold in the markets of the capital _and where people would buy
them!''
   Felix Sarnov, a 35-year-old chain smoker, said he spent a week
without cigarettes and felt so ill he could hardly get out of bed.
   ``We've never been without tobacco before,'' he said. ``You can
do without vegetables, various foods and things like that. But if
you're a smoker, cigarettes are your No. 1 need.''
   On Wednesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev publicly
berated five senior officials for allowing the tobacco crisis to
develop. On Thursday, he fired First Deputy Prime Minister Vladilen
Nikitin, who headed the state commission on foodstuffs and
purchases.
   Earlier this week, President Najibullah of Afghanistan sent a
special plane with 4 million packs of cigarettes to the Soviet
people, the government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   Tass on Friday said cigarettes are among the items Moscow soon
will purchase from Albania, ending a 29-year-old break in trade
with that nation.
   Reasons for the shortages are varied and murky, but they show
that the old central planning system is in a state of collapse.
   In the case of tobacco, harvests have dwindled, and a shortage
of foreign currency in Soviet coffers forced a reduction in
cigarette imports this year.
   The health ministry has said of the medicine shortage only that
the pharmaceutical industry is crumbling.
   But observers say the Soviet Union has concentrated on producing
a large volume of a few drugs, such as polio vaccine, that it can
sell abroad for hard currency, while neglecting the needs of its
population for birth control pills, stomach medications and
headache remedies. Those items, as well as antibiotics and more
specialized drugs, are in chronic short supply.

   The government steeply increased
utility rates Friday and announced plans to lay off thousands of
public employees in an effort to cut the financial deficit and
stimulate an economy in deep recession.
   Hours earlier, President Carlos Menem asked his countrymen to
have patience with his 13-month-old government, which took office
amid hyperinflation and recession.
   Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez said many public employees
under contract would be laid off beginning in September, and civil
servants would be forced to retire early. He gave no figure, but
analysts said the total would reach at least 80,000 of a public
workforce of 3 million.
   Gonzalez said gasoline prices for cars would go up 35 percent as
of Saturday, and other public service rates would increase by an
average 12 to 15 percent, or about the rate of inflation projected
for August.
   He said his ministry will oversee the 13 biggest state
companies, which until now reported to the Public Works Ministry,
and the major factories that until now were part of the Defense
Ministry.
   The state airline, railroad, telphone and other companies must
pay their debts from their revenue and budgets because the Central
Bank no longer will make up their deficits, he announced.
   The Central Bank will require all banks that owe it money to
clear up their accounts. Those that cannot will be forced out of
business, he said.
   ``Argentina is undertaking a profound transformation of the
public sector,'' Gonzalez said in a address on state radio and TV.
The goal ``is a state that is austere and efficient . . . (and
capable) of all the tasks of a modern state.''
   The measures were imposed by decree.
   Menem's solution to Argentina's economic straits has been to
reduce the role of the state in the economy and spur private
enterprise.
   ``We're looking from the national government to restructure the
state, to do serious surgery on the state, and for that sacrifice
and understanding are needed,'' Menem told reporters. ``The party
is over.''
   The Menem government removed controls on prices and foreign
exchange, linked public service rates and their costs, reduced
import tariffs and export taxes, cut the 1990 budget by $4 billion,
encouraged foreign investment and partially deregulated the oil
industry.
   The government also has proposed tax reform and reorganizing the
Central Bank to make it more independent.
   As a result, the increase in the monthly cost of living fell to
near single digits in July from 197 percent 12 months earlier. The
exchange rate has held steady for six months. The fiscal deficit
narrowed.
   The cost has been a deep recession, however. Unemployment and
underemployment at a combined rate of 18 percent is a record. Real
wages have not kept up with inflation. Many families are hard
pressed to make ends meet.
   Wage strikes and public protests about the pending sale of
public firms like the airline and phone company are increasing.
Teachers have boycotted public classrooms for a month.
   Political leaders openly worry about the prospect of social
upheaval, such as the food riots of May and June 1989 which killed
16 people, wounded more than 200 and resulted in nearly 2,500
arrests.

   The U.N. chief tried for five hours Friday to get Iraq to think
twice about its occupation of Kuwait, and Baghdad announced it was
sending more foreign men to be serve as shields at potential
military targets.
   ``Every place, every town that has a vital installation will
host our guests,'' an Iraqi government spokesman said. Iraq calls
``guests'' the thousands of Westerners it has detained since it
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf, did some tough talking of his own. He called Iraqi
generals ``a bunch of thugs,'' but said war can be averted if Iraqi
troops stay out of Saudi Arabia.
   He also said he could not let the fate of hostages in Iraq
affect his strategy.
   About 21,000 Westerners _ including 3,000 Americans and 4,500
Britons _ have been prevented from leaving Iraq and Kuwait.
   U.S. Embassy diplomats in Kuwait are resisting Iraqi orders to
close the mission and said water was running low, food was spoiling
and they were sleeping outdoors to escape the heat because
electricity also was cut off, according to a report in the Saturday
edition of The New York Times.
   The report from Kuwait quoted Ambassador Nathaniel Howell as
remarking ``it isn't a very pleasant way'' to live.
   Baghdad also tied the release of 237 foreign women and children
to the return of Iraqis it said were stranded in Britain and France
as a result of international trade sanctions.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar met twice with
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, in Amman, Jordan, trying to
negotiate a solution to the gulf crisis. The two will meet again
Saturday.
   Aziz told reporters later all foreigners in Iraq could leave if
Perez de Cuellar could produce guarantees against a military attack
from the West.
   Iraq made a similar offer to Washington on Wednesday, through
its U.S. ambassador. The United States rejected any conditions for
releasing hostages.
   Perez de Cuellar called the talks a ``step forward,'' but said
nothing about guarantees and said he had no immediate plans to go
to Baghdad to meet President Saddam Hussein. A senior Jordanian
official had said the two would meet if the Amman meetings yielded
results.
   Aziz said upon arrival that Iraq ``will achieve victory despite
the international conspiracy against it.'' But later he also said
Iraq ``has no intention of igniting the explosive situation.''
   More than 50,000 supporters of the fundamentalist Moslem
Brotherhood marched through Amman's streets on Friday demanding
holy war against ``U.S.-Zionist aggression'' on Arab soil.
   Sources in Baghdad, meanwhile, said nationwide food rationing
would begin Saturday, a result of U.N.-ordered sanctions against
Iraq.
   Coupon books were issued and food distribution centers were set
up, the sources said in telephone interviews. Long lines formed at
bakeries in the capital, and similar queues were reported outside
food shops in smaller towns.
   In Washington, the White House said President Bush telephoned
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and French President Francois Mitterrand on Friday on the crisis.
   Bush wants wealthy allies to help foot the $1 billion-a-month
cost of deploying U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and the gulf region.
   Administration sources said some allies and congressmen were
pressuring the White House to move militarily against Saddam, but
that the pressure by no means constituted a consensus.
   In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blamed Saddam
for the ``very dangerous'' situation in the gulf, but noted his
nation still favors a diplomatic solution. He said ``we have to act
responsibly, all of us, to prevent a large-scale military
conflict.''
   About 60,000 U.S. combat troops have moved to battle stations
and their number is expected to hit 100,000 soon, facing an
estimated 265,000 Iraqi troops stationed in and around Kuwait.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said a government-chartered
passenger plane left Saturday for Amman to airlift Japanese women
and children from Iraq. An official, speaking anonymously, said 80
Japanese, mostly women and children, will be flown home.
   The Office of the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator appealed in
Geneva for more shelters, food and sanitary equipment for about
90,000 people _ mostly Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and
Filipinos _ it says have taken refuge in Jordan after fleeing Iraq
and Kuwait.
   About 20,000 new evacuees are arriving daily, it said.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said an
American woman was granted an exit visa and allowed to leave for
Jordan. A U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said no Americans had been
granted exit permits by Friday. There was no explanation for the
discrepancy.
   Nineteen Italians _ 16 women and three children _ arrived safely
in Jordan Friday. They were believed to be among the first
Westerners to go free under Iraq's offer Tuesday to release women
and children.
   Three Finnish women left Iraq for Turkey, the Finnish government
said. Greece, Sweden and Britain all reported some of their women
and children receiving exit visas.
   On Thursday, Iraq assembled more than 200 foreign women and
children at Baghdad's Menia Hotel after promising to release them.
Some were held earlier at Iraqi military and civilian targets, used
as human shields by Saddam to discourage possible U.S. attacks.
   Most of the foreigners at the hotel were from the United States,
Britain, France, Japan and Australia.
   Iraq has said the women and children will need exit visas. Since
Friday was the Moslem sabbath, exit visas were not expected before
Saturday.
   Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said more than 200
foreign women and children were waiting to leave for London and
Paris on Iraqi Airways. He said Iraq wanted the same planes used to
bring back Iraqis he said were stranded in the two cities by the
``brutal American sanctions.''
   The proposal was not a condition for the release of the 237
foreingers, but without Iraqi planes the group might have to travel
overland, he said.
   The trade sanctions placed no restrictions on Iraqis living
overseas. Britain's Foreign Office said it had no objections to the
Iraqis leaving.
   France said it was not officially informed of the Iraqi demands.
France has put 26 Iraqi military or civilian defense personnel
under police surveillance since canceling their training programs
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   It was not immediately clear whether al-Hadithi was referring to
the 26. About 1,700 Iraqis, many of them exiled opponents of
Saddam, live in France.
   More foreign men have been taken to potential military targets
all over Iraq, al-Hadithi said.
   ``We're relocating the foreign men all over the country at
airports, air bases, military bases, industrial plants,
communications centers, power centers and oil refineries _ wherever
Iraq considers it has a vital installation, one exposed to the
American threat in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   In other developments:
   _Arab foreign ministers ended a two-day emergency session in
Cairo with a new condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a
call for Iraq to immediately release foreign hostages, conference
sources said.
   _The Kota Wirama, the first freighter to be stopped, searched
and boarded by the U.S. Navy during the gulf crisis, is trying to
find a port that will accept its cargo bound for Iraq, Lloyd's List
International said Friday. Also Friday, the Pentagon said that an
Iraqi tanker had been boarded in the Red Sea by a party from the
USS Biddle. ``The vessel was determined to be empty and allowed to
proceed,'' a Pentagon official said.
   _Six more warships from the United States, Britain and the
Netherlands entered Egypt's Suez Canal en route toward the Persian
Gulf, joining dozens already there. Norway said Friday it will send
a coast guard vessel to the multinational force.
   _An Israeli military source said Jordanian military planes are
flying spy missions along the Saudi border to supply Iraq with
information on troop movements.

   In American eyes, the United Nations has come
a long way since those days a generation ago when signs sprouted
along the nation's highways carrying a succinct message: ``The U.S.
Out of the U.N. and the U.N. Out of the U.S.''
   That was a time when the U.N. was a target of widespread
ridicule, seemingly incapable of doing much to keep the peace. The
image of the grim-faced Soviet envoy casting veto after veto was a
topic of many a political cartoon.
   But the ability of Washington and Moscow to get along has
breathed new life into the long-beleaguered world body, which is
coming off one of the best months of its 45-year history.
   Without much fanfare, the Security Council this week laid the
groundwork for an end to the 11-year-old civil war in Cambodia.
Such agreement had been impossible beforehand because three of the
five Security Council members _ the United States, the Soviet Union
and China _ had been backing different factions in that conflict.

   A broken electronic part caused NASA
to scrub Saturday's scheduled launch of space shuttle Columbia,
extending the bad luck that has dogged the space agency all year.
   NASA officials waited until late Thursday night before halting
the countdown for a scientific mission that was to last nine or 10
days. Another attempt won't be made before Wednesday.
   The culprit was in an electronic box that routes electrical
power and telemetry between the spacecraft and an X-ray telescope
mounted at the rear of its cargo bay.
   The launch control center had been unable to issue commands to
the telescope since the shuttle's cargo bay doors were closed
Wednesday evening.

   Police said they still didn't have a
``hot suspect'' in the slayings of five college students, but
investigators were dispatched across the state to track down leads.
   About 600 law enforcement officials are involved in a hunt for
the killer, who investigators have said is a ``methodical maniac''
with a sick grudge against petite brunettes with shoulder-length
hair.
   The victims _ students at either the University of Florida or
Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbed to death in off-campus
apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday. Police said
three of the women were mutilated.
   Funeral services were scheduled for four of the victims in their
hometowns today. They are Christina Powell, 17, of Jacksonville;
Christa Hoyt, 18, of Newberry; Tracy Paules, 23, of Coral Gables;
and Manuel Taboada, 23, of Miami.
   On Thursday, more that a thousand friends and family members
gathered at a Pompano Beach church to mourn Miss Powell's roommate,
18-year-old Sonja Larson.

   Political storm clouds are gathering
over the Philippines, creating the perception that President
Corazon Aquino's government faces a grave and perhaps final crisis.
   Such fears have long plagued the Aquino government, which came
to power in the heady days of the 1986 ``people power revolution''
that deposed the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But in the past three weeks, public confidence has plummeted.
Rumors of a new coup attempt are rampant. Commentators believe the
nation is facing a political showdown that may spell the end of
Philippine democracy.
   ``Four years after its restoration, constitutional democracy in
the Philippines is heading toward collapse ahead of the end of
President Aquino's term in 1992,'' wrote Amando Doronila, editor of
the pro-government newspaper, The Manila Chronicle.

   Residents of the nation's capital finally are
focusing attention on who will be their city's next leader after
spending months preoccupied with the drug and perjury trial of
outgoing Mayor Marion Barry.
   While Barry's trial dominated the news, the mayor's would-be
successors did little or no campaigning, saving their efforts for a
time when they would have the voters' full attention.
   Five Democrats and one Republican are running for mayor, with
the winner of the Sept. 11 Democratic primary considered the
prohibitive favorite in a city where Democrats outnumber
Republicans by almost a 9-1 margin.
   ``Until last week, the press wasn't paying any attention to this
campaign,'' said City Council Chairman David Clarke, who is one of
the Democratic contenders. ``Finally, we can get the issues out
before the voters.''

   Connecticut has rediscovered a relic from
its Puritan past: Police this summer have charged four people with
adultery.
   In a state known for progressive laws on abortion rights,
education and the environment, use of the rarely enforced state
adultery law is raising eyebrows.
   ``It's a dinosaur,'' said New Haven attorney Hugh Keefe. ``What
a spouse needs if she has a cheating husband is a divorce lawyer,
not a cop.''
   Under the law, a married person commits adultery by having
sexual intercourse with someone other than his or her spouse.
Single people cannot be charged. Conviction on the misdemeanor
charge carries up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.

   Labor Day weekend travelers will be taking the summer's last
fling on the most expensive fuel in years, and travel experts say a
few may just decide to stay home.
   The estimated 25.5 million who do travel could find other
obstacles. A nationwide traffic reporting service issued a list of
highways that motorists might want to avoid, and several states
planned to use random checkpoints to nab drunken drivers.
   The American Automobile Association expects a 2 percent decline
in air, train, bus and car travel from last year _ partly due to
rising gasoline prices following Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait and partly due to an economic downturn that predates the
Middle East crisis.
   AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla., says Americans are expected to
travel 100 million miles by all modes of transportation during the
three-day weekend, during which more people are traditionally
killed on highways than any other holiday period.

   Shunichi Suzuki, the governor of Tokyo, has the
kind of power many heads of state would envy.
   At his disposal are an army of 200,000 municipal workers and an
annual budget about equal to China's, or those of South Korea and
Taiwan combined.
   Suzuki may not have the prestige of the prime minister, but his
post is an enticing one.
   He is called governor, not mayor, because Tokyo has special
status as Japan's only ``to,'' or metropolis. Suzuki, a former high
official in the national bureaucracy, boasted to an interviewer
that he helped obtain the designation.
   In 11 years, he has taken Tokyo from the brink of bankruptcy to
a surplus of $6.6 billion. Then Suzuki started building a high-rise
City Hall complex that will cost nearly $1 billion, and his public
soon became less adoring.
   ``Twenty-first Century Tower of Babel,'' one headline screamed.
``Tax Tower,'' another complained.
   Suzuki was accused of plotting to turn City Hall into a personal
palace, complete with marble bathtub and golden fixtures. One
report likened the conservative governor to Nicolae Ceausescu, the
cCommunist dictator of Romania who was overthrown and executed last
December.
   The City Hall complex nearing completion consists of two
skyscrapers, 48 and 34 stories high, and a seven-story Metropolitan
Assembly building.
   City officials, once quick to note that the 795-foot main
building will be Japan's tallest, now note with equal alacrity that
the honor will not last long. A building under construction in
nearby Yokohama will be slightly taller, they say.
   ``I just don't understand it,'' Suzuki said. ``Not many people
realize this, but no tax money is being used for building City
Hall. It's all coming from lottery profits and other sources.''
   Whether the governor, 79, runs for an unprecedented fourth term
or not, rumors are circulating that Tokyo will have its first hotly
contested governor's race in decades. Suzuki's term ends in April,
one month after the new City Hall is scheduled to open.
   He acknowledges the bad press has damaged his image. ``A good
deal of bad information has been published, and you can't help it
if that's what people end up believing,'' he said in the interview.
   Until the City Hall project came along, even Suzuki's critics
would have had difficulty finding evidence of extravagance.
   By cutting 17,000 people from the city payroll and reducing
municipal pensions, Suzuki moved Tokyo from a debt of 350 billion
yen (then $1.55 billion) to the black in just three years after
taking office in 1979.
   Suzuki avoided the question of whether he will seek a fourth
term with the comment: ``Right now I have my hands full with my
current responsibilities.'' ``I'm certain he will run again, and I
think he'll win,'' said Toshiya Mita, a conservative member of the
Metropolitan Assembly. ``There's just no one to replace him.''
   In his three election victories, Suzuki has had the support of
three major conservative parties: the Liberal Democrats, Komei
(Clean Government) and Democratic Socialists.
   That support is now said to be eroding and reports say the
Socialists, Japan's largest opposition group, are considering a run
for the governorship by their popular leader, Takako Doi.
   Mrs. Doi led her party to impressive election gains after
bribery and other scandals last year that tainted leaders of the
governing Liberal Democrats, business and the bureaucracy.
   Nearly 12 million people live within Tokyo's city limits and
greater Tokyo has 30 million _ one-fourth of Japan's population on
2 percent of its land.
   Crime rates are low, drug abuse is uncommon and there are few
signs of the abject poverty that haunts many major cities in the
United States and Europe.
   Aside from extremely high land prices, which have helped Tokyo
increase its fiscal surplus, Suzuki's main declared battles have
been against illegal parking and garbage.
   The city has enough money to fight whatever battles it chooses.
This year's budget is $44 billion, one-tenth of the national figure.
   ``If waterworks and miscellaneous expenditures are included, it
would be about $66 billion, about the same as the national budget
of China,'' Suzuki said.
   China's budget for 1990 is roughly $70 billion dollars, South
Korea's is $34 billion dollars, and Taiwan plans to spend $33
billion.
   Despite Suzuki's reduction of the payroll, the Tokyo bureaucracy
still is a huge machine.
   More than 13,000 city employees will move from more than a dozen
old municipal buildings into the new City Hall, with more than
3,000 truckloads of paper.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing she did the past 10 years, Basia says
now, prepared her to become an overnight sensation.
   There was the obligatory dues paying: the years of belting out
jingles for commercials, backing up other vocalists, singing for
Top-40 groups in the United States and England. There was even her
first album, ``Time and Tide,'' that seemed to grow slowly but
surely on a worldwide audience.
   But then came a second hit album, ``London-Warsaw-New York,''
and a frenetic world tour that has turned everything upside down.
   ``It's been traumatic so far,'' the Polish-born pop singer,
whose full name is Basia Trzetrzelewska, said with a giggle. But
it's been a good kind of trauma, the ebullient young woman confided.
   And even a recent bout with a virus that forced her to cancel
two shows on her summer U.S. tour and left her normally languid
voice slightly raspy couldn't dampen her spirits during a recent
phone interview from Chicago.
   ``I'm enjoying this tour so much now,'' she said. ``We really
have a good band. For the first time, every member of the group is
exactly right. Everything just clicked this time.''
   It wasn't always that easy. Becoming an overnight sensation took
a long time.
   It started in the Polish industrial city of Jaworzno, where
Basia grew up listening to Western music, everything from Charlie
Parker to Prince, with Pink Floyd and Carole King on the side.
   She started singing with an all-girl group while still in her
teens, and left for London in 1981 to make a serious stab at a
musical career. Her leaving, she says, allowed her to experience
only from afar much of the economic and political turmoil her
countrymen went through in the 1980s.
   ``I left just before martial law got introduced,'' she said in a
voice that now contains a strong English accent.
   ``Before that, my life (in Poland) was pretty carefree and
careless. I remember that nothing really was missing in my life. We
had enough to eat, we were comfortable. My parents had their own
business producing ice cream. . . . I had my music and my friends.''
   She incorporated everything she heard into her own upbeat style,
one that's heavy on jazz, pop, Latin rhythms and American rhythm
and blues.
   And just after her arrival in London, she met longtime
collaborator Danny White whose musical interests were equally
broad. By the mid-1980s, the two decided it was time to strike out
on their own. But that wasn't easy either.
   ``Danny kept encouraging me to write,'' she said. ``He would
give me a verse and I had to finish the rest of the song.'' It was
something she hated.
   ``To shut him up, I finally just did it, and we wrote a whole
album that way.''
   The album was ``Time and Tide.'' It was her first and quickly
sold 100,000 copies after its 1987 release. The record company was
delighted, but she was disappointed because she was hoping for a
gold record (for 500,000 copies sold). But the LP just kept on
selling, going gold in 1988 and platinum (for 1 million albums
sold) the following year.
   Then everything exploded. ``London-Warsaw-New York'' came out
earlier this year and zoomed up the charts, going gold in three
weeks. The small club dates from the last American tour quickly
became huge concert-hall events. Following this summer's U.S. tour,
there will be concerts in Japan. Then it's back to the United
States in the fall for more shows.
   The success has made her one of Poland's biggest stars.
   ``Now, when I tell my mum something, she's already seen it in
the interview,'' she quipped.
   But her mother hasn't seen her perform in front of thousands
yet. She's only seen her daughter's videos. So there will soon be a
series of concerts in Poland, too.
   ``This is something that is very much on my mind, it's important
to me,'' Basia said. Family also is important, and she returns home
several times a year. ``When I'm there I get so sentimental and
soppy that I just want to cry.''
   In fact, if success has a downside it is that it has kept her
from starting her own family.
   ``This is something I miss the most,'' she said. ``I envy people
who have a stable family life. Career, it's one thing. But it's
nothing compared to that. I really want it badly, and sometimes I'm
afraid I won't get it. I didn't meet the right person yet, I'm
afraid.
   ``But I'm still keeping my eyes open,'' she adds, turning upbeat
again.

<HEAD>JAMES MICHENER: His Secret Is Routine</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JACK KEEVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Routine is James Michener's secret. But the
results are hardly routine.
   Despite quintuple bypass heart surgery, a new left hip,
extensive dental work and an attack of permanent vertigo, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist still produces massive tomes at the
age of 83, 10 books altogether in the last four years.
   His fans, in awe of his output, wonder how he does it. With the
September publication of his latest work, they'll find out.
   In a lengthy prologue to ``The Eagle and the Raven,'' Michener
says the work may appear to be ``an almost indecent display of
frenzied industry but it was carried out slowly, carefully, each
morning at the typewriter, each afternoon filled with exciting
research and reflection.''
   Light exercise and diet, a nap and classical music are part of
each day for this prolific writer, who says he could not possibly
remain idle.
   ``I have had a burst of energy I could never have anticipated,
not only to write more books but particularly to leave a picture of
a professional writer at work,'' Michener said.
   Michener divides his time among Austin, where he teaches writing
at the University of Texas; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Brunswick,
Maine.
   Deborah Brothers, co-owner of State House Press of Austin, which
is publishing the book, said the prologue answers many questions
reader ask about Michener's life.
   ``Curiously, during this spurt of energy I have never thought of
myself as either compulsive or driven _ nor was I,'' Michener said.
``Through decades of writing I have acquired certain patterns of
behavior and workmanship which had enabled me to write long books.
   ``I merely adhere to those solid rules. I rise each day at 7:30,
wash my face in cold water but do not shave, eat a frugal breakfast
of bran sprinkled with banana, raisins and skim milk, no sugar, and
go directly to my desk, where the day's work has been laid out the
night before.
   ``With delight and a feeling of well-being, I leap into whatever
task awaits and remain at it until half after noon, when I have a
light lunch after which I take a nap. I never type in the afternoon
but do meet classes at the university.
   ``At dusk each day, regardless of the weather, I take a mile
walk at a rather brisk clip. Supper, the evening news, a nine
o'clock movie if a good one is available on television, a half-hour
of cleaning my desk at 11 and off to bed.''
   Also, he said, ``Each day without fail, I find time to listen to
classical music on my new compact disc player,'' including Chopin,
Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert, Brahms, Bartok, Stravinsky and operatic
arias.
   ``I never play the music while I work at original composition
but often listen to it when doing routine work like checking
pagination, reading stacks of accumulated mail or filing research
material. The long walks, the sensible diet and the music keep me
healthy and able to complete the work,'' Michener said.
   One nagging question remains. ``Was I . . . apprehensive of
work-ending death? And . . . did I labor so diligently because of
my age and the approach of a time when I could work no more?
   ``I think not. I write at 83 for the same reasons that impelled
me to write at 43: I was born with a passionate desire to
communicate, to organize experience, to tell tales that dramatize
the adventures which listeners might have had,'' Michener said.
   ``The job of a storyteller is to tell stories, and I have
concentrated on that obligation.''
   The storytelling in ``The Eagle and the Raven'' comes in a
modified, expanded version of a lengthy chapter pulled from
``Texas,'' published in 1986.
   It follows the lives of generals Santa Anna of Mexico and Sam
Houston of Texas. Their brief encounter in 1836 at the Battle of
San Jacinto, which enabled Texas to win its independence from
Mexico, is considered by many historians to be one of the decisive
battles of the world.

   ``Last Images of the Shipwreck''
suffered the usual fate of a good Argentine movie.
   It won best script, best actress and best movie honors at film
festivals in Montreal, Havana and Biarritz last year. At home,
about 50,000 Argentines paid to see it.
   ``I'm proud of it . . . (but) economically, it was a disaster,''
director Elisio Subiela said.
   Many recent Argentine films have been marked by high praise and
empty seats. ``The Official Story'' was ignored by moviegoers until
it won the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1985 and was
re-released.
   Several years ago, ``Last Images of the Shipwreck'' might have
been considered a success because of the international prizes.
Today, it is viewed as a failure because of the box office.
   Argentina's movie industry is changing priorities and themes, in
part because it is on the verge of collapse. State support has
dried up, movie fans watch more at home on video and cable TV and
local productions have to search overseas for financing.
   ``The industry is living through a crisis that has structural
overtones,'' said Octavio Getino, director of the National
Institute of Cinematography.
   Overall attendance dropped to 25 million last year, from 64
million in 1984. Nearly four of every 10 theaters opened five years
ago have shut down.
   The decline in attendance at Argentine films was even steeper:
to 1.2 million from 11.6 million. In 1987, five of the top
10-grossing films were Argentine. Last year, there were only two.
   As few as seven local films will be made this year, compared to
about 40 in 1986. Only successful directors can line up financing,
much of which comes from Europe and the United States. Many actors
now work abroad.
   The downturn has been sudden even considering the topsy-turvy
industry whose fortunes reflect four decades of political coups and
economic instability.
   In the 1940s and early '50s, Buenos Aires was a sort of
Hollywood South. Five production companies churned out dozens of
films a year, mostly lowbrow comedies that were hits up and down
the continent.
   The 1980s, in contrast, saw serious films with political and
social messages honored at Cannes and screened in New York and Los
Angeles _ developments that rarely happened before.
   The 1976-83 military dictatorship, which censured 727 films,
provided rich material for moviemakers. The ``dirty war'' on
leftist subversion was the backdrop for ``The Official Story.'' The
spurious and futile Falkland Islands War with Britain was the theme
of ``The Internal Debt.''
   Those and other Argentine films were angry shouts about events
that for years a prudent person would whisper only to a friend.
They upheld values that helped Argentines cope with innocent lives
brutally torn apart, and to repair the country's international
image.
   Getino suggests the time has come for directors to move on to
other, perhaps less somber, ideas. ``I'm . . . convinced that if a
movie interests people, they'll pay to see it,'' he said. ``Our
directors have to find what that is.''
   Directors are searching.
   ``Last Images of the Shipwreck'' is an off-beat love story about
a would-be novelist who saves a woman he believes is about to throw
herself in the path of a train. As they get to know each other, she
inspires him to write.
   Director Eduardo Mignona is putting the finishing touches on
``Flop, the Argentine Marksman.'' The movie is based on the life of
Florencio Parravicini, a turn-of-the-century stage actor whose
specialty was shooting bullets through bottles without breaking
them.
   Maria Luisa Bemberg's film, ``I, The Worst of All,'' premiered
this summer. It is about Juan Ines de la Cruz, a nun who battled
sexual stereotypes in 17th-century Mexico and today is acclaimed as
one of the greatest poets of Spain's ``Golden Age.''
   ``I thought that through (her) I could tell a story about . . .
the fight of a free spirit to express herself,'' Bemberg said.
``Juana . . . was . . . an advanced spirit, absolutely contemporary
in the way she saw the world.''
   Bemberg's 1984 historical film, ``Camila,'' was a rare artistic
and commercial success. It was nominated for the best foreign film
Oscar and drew 2 million people to the theater.
   Making movies in Argentina has never been easy. Director Carlos
Sorin underscored that point in ``The King's Movie,'' a whimsical
1985 film about a 19th-century adventurer who briefly ruled the
Araucanian Indians in southern Patagonia.
   As filming drags on, funds run out and the cast quits. The
director, ever resourceful, finally dresses up as the hero and
rides through an army of mannequins who take the place of Indians.
In the closing scene, he brainstorms his next project.
   As fewer local movies are made and producers are forced to seek
funds abroad, directors wonder who will put Argentina's ideas,
music, scenery and people on film if Argentines cannot.
   Subiela, who is vice president of the Argentina Film Directors
association, argues there is only one way out: more state funding.
That seems unlikely in the short run. The government of President
Carlos Menem is faced with budget deficits, inflation and recession.
   The National Institute of Cinematography budget in 1985 was $11
million. So far this year, it has received $200,000.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Romanian expatriates are trying to
help cool passions that linger after the revolution by teaching
Western journalism to reporters who never had to distinguish fact
from fiction.
   Under Nicolae Ceausescu, Communist authorities replaced the
journalism department at Bucharest University with an
indoctrination course for party officials, to make sure the
propaganda machine ran smoothly.
   The result, even after the dictator was overthrown and executed
in December, is a polarized press that often inflames the public.
   What passes for news is a one-sided mix of opinion sprinkled
with a few facts. Pro-government and opposition papers are equally
guilty.
   Government spokesmen claim the opposition shames Romania. The
independent daily Romania Libera began a recent response: ``So we
don't want the good of the country?''
   A new five-part journalism course being given at the League of
Human Rights headquarters in Bucharest is the brainchild of
expatriate Gabriel Nicolescou, an architect who founded the
Romanian Freedom Forum in Chicago and publishes a Romanian-English
monthly called Democratic Romania.
   His partner, 28-year-old Michael Maldarescu, finances the course
from profits generated by his new telephone news line in Chicago,
called Inside Romania.
   Irish journalist Sean Hillen, one of the several foreign
teachers, said his 140 students ``still have trouble distinguishing
between fact and opinion.''
   ``It's difficult to get them to understand that their opinions
are irrelevant to objective reporting,'' he said, ``but they are
enthusiastic about journalism and learning about the world
outside.''
   His students, some of whom worked in the state-controlled media
under Ceausescu, recognize the problems.
   ``Events in Romania caused the reporting to be out of passion
and journalists took sides,'' said Mariana Trifian, 27. ``The
course will help eliminate that. I feel now that I will be able to
control myself. . . . It would be better for the people to read
objective reporting.''
   Hennelise Koch, 26, said readers raised on the old journalism
are part of the problem. She said they ``need to be taught to read
an objective newspaper and not be looking for political
allegiances.''
   Maldarescu, the money man, said the course, ``tries to teach
potential journalists here what Western journalism is all about . .
. so they see why it is that, if you took any article that appeared
in a Romanian paper and tried to publish it in the West, it just
wouldn't work.''
   Hillen said students are taught everything from layout to
writing leads and headlines, and how to conduct interviews for
various media.
   A recent class posed this problem:
   ``If you had a six-hour deadline to write an article about
adoption and you knew absolutely nothing about the subject, what
would you do?''
   The guest lecturer was Catherine Adams, a reporter for
Independent Radio Network and United Press International.
   Maldarescu said the course is accredited by the Romanian
government and he is working on a plan for making it an associate
degree program recognized by U.S. universities.
   He said he hopes the school and his telephone news line,
especially its financial service, ``will enable a flow of
information from here to there and the other way around so that
Romanians begin to understand a little better the concept of a free
market and society, and we begin to understand the situation in
Romania.''

<HEAD>Southern Leaders Search for Solution to Civil War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders from southern Sudan have come
together for the first time to seek ways of ending the civil war
that has ravaged their region for seven years.
   In the forefront is retired Gen. Joseph Lagu, a southerner who
fought the government for 17 years and now is its chief U.N.
delegate. Many southerners hold Lagu largely responsible for the
process that led to the current war.
   ``We have to appeal to both the government and those in the bush
for a cease-fire,'' he told a rally of southerners held to
inaugurate the peace effort. ``We must talk both to our people in
government and the rebel areas.''
   Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed
or died of famine, and most experts feel neither side can win.
   Several national and international mediation efforts have
failed. The latest was a short-lived U.S. attempt declared dead in
August by Col. Mohammed al-Amin al-Khalifa, the government
representative in negotiations with the rebels.
   This is the first attempt at a solution by southerners, whose
lives have been scarred by intermittent war and famine since Sudan
became independent of Britain and Egypt in 1956.
   At the heart of the current and past wars are the religious and
racial conflicts between the Moslem Arabs of the north, who control
the government, and the black Christians and aminists of the south.
   More than 100 politicians from the south, an area the size of
Texas, are involved in the current search for peace. Many were
political prisoners until their release this summer.
   Brig. Pio Yukuwan Deng, the chief organizer, is one of three
southerners in the 15-member military junta that has ruled Sudan
since June 30, 1989.
   Deng, a Christian who served with Lagu's rebels in the 1960s,
told the rally: ``We must have our say in the peacemaking in this
country. Without southerners coming together, peace cannot be
realized in Sudan.''
   Southerners never have united, even in the cause of secession.
   For 17 years, Lagu led the Anyanya movement, whose main support
came from relatively minor tribes in the huge Equatoria region. The
organization's name denotes the poison of the Gabon viper.
   Nearly all the rebels of the current Sudan People's Liberation
Army are Dinka, the south's main tribe, based in the Nile River
provinces. Dinka neither trust nor are trusted by the Equatorians.
   Lagu came to terms in 1972 with President Gaafar Nimeiri, who
was overthrown in 1985, and joined the army in the name of national
reconciliation.
   Southern Sudanese believe the current war is rooted in the
discovery of oil in the south in the early 1980s.
   They say the discovery prompted Nimeiri to renege on commitments
he made in the 1972 peace agreement and divide the autonomous south
into three weak regions.
   That was accomplished by having Lagu instigate the small tribes
against the Dinka. In the turmoil that resulted, Nimeiri decreed
the partition.
   Col. John Garang, a U.S.-trained southerner, mutinied in the
garrison town of Bor, 650 miles south of Khartoum, the capital,
formed a rebel army and went into the bush.
   Garang demands more say in government for the south and a larger
share of the nation's resources for the region.
   At the rally, Lagu asked forgiveness. He told the crowd he had
helped destroy southern influence and spawned Garang's rebellion
because ``I wanted to reduce the domination of small tribes by the
big tribes.''
   Sira Nay, a southern political activist at the rally, said the
problem was as much politics as tribalism.
   ``Only the military can bring peace to this country,'' he said.
``They don't have the constraints of the political parties, who
have their own axes to grind.''
   Nay pointed out that the military ended Lagu's rebellion in
1972, three years after Nimeiri seized power in a coup, and he
declared: ``Now we will wait and see if this government can repeat
history.''
   The junta, led by Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, has said
ending the war is a prime objective but has done little to achieve
it.

   Kasey Rose, the only woman at the U.S.
Forest Service's North Cascades Smokejumper Base, is either
parachuting to a forest fire or practicing to do just that.
   The 22-year-old collegiate rower and pre-med student said she
ventured into the intensely male field for the physical challenge,
the excitement and the chance to make $10,000 during the summer.
   ``I want to prove to myself that I can do this,'' she said.
``You make good money and you get to stay in shape. That's real
important for rowing.''
   It has been 50 years since the first smokejumpers leaped from
airplanes to snuff small wildfires before they turned into big
ones. The elite strike force now has 400 members, but only about
seven women.
   Ms. Rose, in her second year of smokekjumping, has 22 jumps to
her credit.
   At 5-foot-11 and 150 pounds, and as captain of a national
champion rowing team at the University of Washington last year, she
has the physical tools for the job. But she said one of the biggest
challenges is to win acceptance from the men.
   Jumpers work in teams of two and should one be injured, the
other has to be capable of carrying the partner to safety.
   Ms. Rose is not quite as strong or as fast as many of the men.
She can do just 12 chin-ups, while many of the men can do 15. And
her time in the mile run often is slower.
   But just to qualify for training, a person must do seven
chin-ups, 25 push-ups, 45 sit-ups and run a mile and a half in
under 11 minutes, Ms. Rose noted.
   ``I can keep up on the job,'' she said. ``But I've heard them
say it's the last male frontier.''

<HEAD>``E.N.G'' Is N.G.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tonight, in the start of an unusual endurance
test, cable's Lifetime network is premiering a one-hour,
Monday-through-Friday drama series called ``E.N.G.''
   The initials stand for for electronic newsgathering. Here, it is
the kind committed in local TV news. CBS also is covering the same
tube turf next month in its new ``WIOU'' series. But only on
Wednesdays.
   With a new episode arriving each evening for at least 44 nights,
the Canadian-made ``E.N.G.'' may accelerate what is known as
Newsblur.
   Newsblur comes from watching too much TV news or shows about TV
news shows. Pretty soon your mind goes poof and you start thinking
that Saddam Hussein is an anchorman who'll do anything for ratings.
   But ``E.N.G.'' does have more than Saddam Hussein. It has a
lovely acting news director, who wants the job full time. She is
having a furtive affair with a handsome, Tom Cruise-edition
cameraman. He is divorced, with two kids.
   There also is a pretty camerawoman who also fools around. She's
just getting over mononucleosis, and those in charge order gamma
globulin shots for everyone in the newsroom.
   Moving right along now, the station manager is a sinister
pecksniff. He always second-guesses the newsies and is ready to
cave in to the mayor and sponsors at a nanosecond's notice.
   There is a blonde reporter who always wants to do ``the lead
story.'' And a handsome twit reporter in a pressed trenchcoat. And
a dense, fatuous anchorman. And a wise, cynical old assignment
editor.
   And yes, the new news director who comes in is hard-nosed and
dedicated to the truth. Handsome and single, he has a trenchcoat,
too.
   Add a hostage crisis at a local grocery store, a shooting of a
hostage that the cameraman gets on tape before he also is taken
hostage, and viola! For the rest of the show, you get a lot of
voila.
   Fortunately, all this developed in the two-hour pilot of the
series that was cablecast Saturday night. If you stepped out for a
beer then, you may want to count your blessings, even though you're
no good at fractions.
   Funny thing is, though, this film-and-tape saga, made in
Toronto, actually has a good cast, particularly with Sara Botsford
as the wanna-be news chief, Art Hindle as the guy who gets the job,
and Mark Humphrey as the dashing cameraman.
   But in the tradition of most TV series about TV news, Saturday's
script by Bryce Zabel and Brad Markowitz left no newsroom cliche
unturned. It ran the gamut, from ethics to cynicism to deep-down
commitment to journalism.
   It emphasized the last so often one was kind of disappointed
there wasn't a station where the announcer said, ``Journalism
erupts in newsroom, film at 11!''
   There also was some Truly Awful Dialogue and a muddled plot
about the town's mayor trying to keep a visiting World's Fair site
selection committee from learning about the grocery store hostage
crisis on live TV.
   This was because the rotten holdup man demanded to go on live TV
and negotiate his way out of hard time in jail. Nix, said the
hard-nosed news director, even though the cameraman-hostage from
his station faced death:
   ``If we let them on the air, every lunatic in this city is going
to grab a gun and try to get on TV.''
   But the medium may be losing its impact.
   Example: Earlier in the show, the twit reporter loses his cool
when he gets roughed up by a cop, even though he identifies himself
as from Newsblur 10, or whatever his program is. Cries the reporter:
   ``Don't you guys watch TV?''
   Er, not at this rate.
   Unless the writing gets, oh, maybe a quantum leap better,
``E.N.G.'' will next be heard from as a 44-episode pileup whose
demise gets only 10 seconds on the evening news over at ``WIOU.''

   AND NOW, THE NEWS: The makers of the sassy, syndicated ``A
Current Affair'' series say that next Saturday they'll start the
one-hour ``A Current Affair Extra,'' a weekend edition anchored by
Maureen O'Boye. They say it will not have ``simple rehashes'' of
the week's stories. Nay, there probably will be complex rehashes.
But they vow brand-new stories, indepth investigations that no
doubt will get to the top of things, and, in case you wonder what's
become of Madonna, ``a lively gossip segment.''

<HEAD>Kids Get Their Once-Yearly Star Turn In Back-To-School Specials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OK, class, listen up. If it's Labor Day Week, it
must be time for those annual television marathons on what ails
public education.
   Happily, CBS and Public Broadcasting are serving up two
unusually engaging and informative back-to-school specials.
   Leading off is ``Learning in America: Schools That Work,'' a
two-hour PBS offering, appearing 9-11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Sept. 5.
Reporter Roger Mudd guides us through four elementary schools that
have defied odds and become special places that put kids first.
It's a refreshing break for viewers awash in bad news about U.S.
schools.
   The program shows classroom life in Northview School, a
working-class school in Manhattan, Kan.; Columbia Park Elementary
School in Landover, Md., where 95 percent of students are black;
City Magnet School, a unique multi-ethnic school in Lowell, Mass.,
with student-run banks, courts and other features of a democratic
free-market society; and Lozano Special Emphasis School, 98 percent
Hispanic where a tough-minded principal has virtually eliminated
absenteeism and boosted test scores.
   City Magnet is especially interesting _ a model of learning by
doing. For one period a day, kids put aside their other academic
chores and hold jobs in a mock democratic society that imitates
real life. Students pay taxes, hold jobs, and sell goods and
services. A girl who hits another gets hauled before a student-run
court and gets a stiff fine.
   Most of all, says one parent, ``the school has heart. A lot of
heart.''
   Mudd concludes by summarizing what makes all four schools
excellent: a devoted belief in the value of public education,
collegiality among teachers, independence from school district
bureaucrats and, above all, a commitment to the children
themselves, a respect for their self-esteem and the ability of each
to learn.
   By focusing on peaceful, carefree elementary schools, the PBS
special exudes a feel-good air that would be far less plausible if
the cameras were aimed at high schools.
   And Mudd dismisses perhaps too lightly the role of money in
school reform.
   Still, the PBS special succeeds admirably in showing why these
schools work while so many others fail. Mudd handles the assignment
with a deft, unobtrusive touch, wisely letting the pictures and
action speak for themselves while keeping the focus clear with
well-chosen commentary.
   Quite different and even more ambitious is CBS's two-hour
offering, ``America's Toughest Assignment: Solving The Education
Crisis,'' airing at 9-11 p.m. EDT Thursday. Anchored by the wise
and civilized Charles Kuralt, the program provides a sort of Cliff
Notes condensation of volumes of school research and thinking
produced during the last decade of school reform.
   Thursday's special is the centerpiece of CBS's ``Project
Education'' taking place Sept. 2-7. There will be education
segments on CBS's ``Sunday Morning,'' ``60 Minutes'' and on the
``Evening News with Dan Rather.''
   The network also is hosting an all-day education conference at
Georgetown University on Wednesday featuring several governors,
business spokesmen and prominent educators.
   Along with Kuralt, the special features virtually every news
star in the CBS firmament except Dan Rather, along with several
governors and many of the nation's leading education spokesmen.
   It was shot in 34 locations across the country; the camera
doesn't pause for long on any classroom scene.
   Among the better moments in this many-faceted special has White
House correspondent Leslie Stahl examining what it will take to
attract better teachers. She goads an uncharacteristically reticent
teacher union leader Albert Shanker into a peppery exchange in
which she keeps repeating: ``Money? Money? Money?''
   ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike Wallace tackles ably the
complicated and politically explosive topic of school finance,
interviewing the governors of Texas, Kentucky and New Jersey, where
the issue is currently hottest.
   Ed Bradley of ``60 Minutes'' hosts the strongest part of the
program, a fascinating look at how poor parents in Arkansas are
being trained to be their children's first teachers.
   Sprinkled throughout the broadcast are nine proposals to improve
American education _ from smaller schools and treating teachers as
professionals to better pre-natal and preschool care.
   Though CBS presents them as their own, such ideas are hardly
new. Reformers have been yelling themselves blue for the past
decade trying to get the public to listen to these ideas.
   Unlike Mudd, Kuralt fails to recap his show's many proposals and
themes at the end of the show.
   Still, who knows? Maybe they'll finally sink in now that Kuralt
has bestowed his homespun endorsement.

   BLACKBOARD JUNGLE: The CBS show ``Top Cops'' weighs in with a
very different segment involving education _ the story of Clemmie
Henderson, an employee at an auto-parts store, who went on a

Chicago high school. The shootout is one of three segments in this
Wednesday's show, which is broadcast at 10 p.m. EDT.

   Frank Dunlop runs the world's biggest
arts festival in Edinburgh on a budget this year of 3.5 million
pounds ($6.6 million) and expects to balance the books.
   Barbara Neville, a computer systems analyst from London, brings
her talents as a storyteller to the three-week festival at a cost
of 1,500 pounds ($2,850) from her own pocket.
   This year, Dunlop has Rudolf Nureyev, the Bolshoi Opera, the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and paintings by Paul Cezanne, but
some critics still complain there aren't enough BIG names.
   ``This is not a festival for Betsy Bloomingdale diamonds and a
different dress every night with a house in the Alps outside
Salzburg,'' Dunlop said in an interview. ``The festival is for
everyone, and our tickets are the cheapest. If we went for just big
names we could find ourselves spending 100,000 pounds ($190,000) on
three days of rehearsals for one orchestra.''
   The prestige of appearing at the festival encourages some
governments to subsidize visits by their arts companies.
   ``We couldn't do the program without that support,'' Dunlop
readily acknowledged.
   Taxpayers, commercial sponsors and the box office make up his
budget.
   Dunlop, a professional stage director who worked in London and
New York and founded the Young Vic, has done extraordinary things.
For six years, he has had stunning successes with Japanese theater
companies performing in their own language.
   ``People these days have been to Hong Kong and around the world
and become incredibly curious about things happening outside
Europe,'' Dunlop said.
   ``It's easier to see a play in a language utterly unknown to you
like Japanese than one in which you might know a few words, like
German.''
   ``I do it for the love of it,'' said Neville, who at 44 is the
same age as the festival. ``I came in 1984 as a visitor for the
first time and it caught me completely, so much that I wanted to do
something.''
   As a performer on the Festival Fringe which runs in tandem with
Dunlop's official arts festival, Neville sits on a high stool in a
church hall and tells stories from the Arabian Nights, Grimm's
Fairy Tales, Jewish folk tales from Eastern Europe and Japanese
stories.
   ``If I get a 50 percent capacity audience I will have covered my
costs,'' she said.
   She will be lucky. It's nothing unusual for a company of
half-a-dozen performers on the Fringe to have an audience of less,
or even no audience at all.
   But still the performers come, sleeping on the floors of crowded
apartments and playing in schoolrooms, churches and pubs, and
paying their own way, including rent for venues.
   ``The Fringe is a phenomenon,'' said administrator Mhairi
Mackenzie-Robinson, who oversees this year's presentation of 9,800
performances of 1,100 different shows by 537 companies, 128 of them
from overseas.
   Few have come farther than the 24 members of the Kumu Kahua
Theater Company from Honolulu, with two Hawaiian history plays.
   Most of them had never been to Europe before and the 10 women in
the company broke into song when they got off the plane.
   ``It cost us a fortune to come,'' said Wayne Kischer, a board
member.
   Sponsors provided much of the cash for the 11,000-mile journey
via Los Angeles and New York. Artistic director Gene Shofner
estimated the cost at between $100,000 and $150,000.
   Shofner, who grew up in San Diego, Calif., said: ``I came to the
Fringe for the first time in 1988 and as soon as I got here and saw
it I was sure we should come. I saw some of the best theater I've
ever seen, and some of the worst.
   ``We came to share our art because we think we are unique.
Broadway and the West End (of London) are for big bucks.''
   Dale Goodson, a free-lance writer with the Gusto House cabaret
quartet from New York City, said, ``We've known about the Fringe
for years and there's nothing comparable back home. We came to make
contacts and encourage people to come to New York.
   ``We dug very deep in our pockets to come. You can't make money
on the Fringe but we want to put on a good show.''

<TEXT>
   Merriment is in scant supply for Wall Street's
observance of the traditional ``business New Year'' at Labor Day
1990.
   As investors and their brokers return in full force from
vacations or other summer diversions, a long agenda of economic and
financial worries faces the securities markets.
   Talk abounds that investors in stocks may be in for a bear
market of unknown severity and duration. In the producing and
consuming economy, many analysts worry that a recession looms _ if
indeed one hasn't already begun.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait cast a month-long shadow over
the world's markets, driving the Dow Jones industrial average down
to its lowest level in more than a year.
   Last week, hopes began to spread that an orderly resolution to
the crisis could be reached. The price of oil, recently as high as
$32 a barrel, fell back into the mid-$20s.
   But even given relief from those tensions, analysts say the
economy and the markets will have a lot of problems to contend with.
   ``Forget the Middle East mess for a moment and recall where we
stood a few weeks ago before Iraq struck,'' declared Martin Zweig
in his stock advisory letter the Zweig Forecast.
   At midyear, Zweig observed, the average stock already showed a
double-digit loss from its 1989 highs, even as a few blue chips had
pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to new highs.
   ``Stock after stock was getting smashed because of overly
optimistic analysts' forecasts and an overvalued market,'' he said.
   ``For many months the economy had been showing numerous signs
that the jig was up and that recession was a high probability.
   ``Interest rates abroad were surging while the dollar was
collapsing. The budget deficit had soared.
   ``The banking system was refusing loans to marginal borrowers as
the banks themselves were hit with credit downgrades and bad loans.
Real estate prices were heading south. Some environment, huh?
   ``The oil jolt was akin to throwing gasoline on a smoldering
fire.''
   Normally, most of the calls for help to put out that fire would
be directed to the Federal Reserve.
   Now, however, many observers are not sure the Fed has the means
at its disposal to bring about the necessary reduction in interest
rates.
   A conventional easing of monetary policy might not achieve that
mission, analysts say, if it exacerbates inflationary fears
prompted by the summer surge in oil prices.
   Still, some observers argue that the timing of the crisis in the
Middle East might not have been quite as bad for the domestic
economy as it looked at first.
   They argue that the damage might prove to be less in an economy
that was already weakening than it could have been in the setting
of a boom.
   ``Inflation psychology was largely absent,'' said Robert
Barbera, economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Manufacturing
companies had been paring both inventories and employees, and
services sector job growth had slowed appreciably.
   ``Given both limited real economy excesses and modest inflation
pressures prior to the Iraq invasion, the effect of the rise in oil
prices on core inflation will be limited,'' Barbera maintained.
   ``Similarly, the absence of any large inventory overhang in the
factory sector will temper the impact of a shortfall in demand.
   ``The economy will contract less because it was already being
squeezed.''

<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After surviving a decade of civil war,
Nicaraguans face inflation of 80 percent a month and three-tiered
pricing that turns a shopping trip into an exercise for number
crunchers.
   Many people tuck a calculator into purse or pocket before
leaving home.
   ``I have to think twice before going out to buy anything,'' said
Susana Montenegro, a middle-class housewife encountered in a
supermarket. ``And not just because everything is so expensive.
It's the conversions back and forth. They give me a headache,''
   A new currency, called the gold cordoba, and the rules governing
its value have made a confusing economy even more so.
   Gold cordobas officially trade at par with the dollar and are
supposed to replace the old cordobas, which Nicaraguans have
christened ``chancheros,'' or ``piggies,'' to set them apart from
the new ones.
   When Mrs. Montenegro buys a 5-pound bag of beans she can pay in
either gold cordobas or dollars and get change in piggies at the
official exchange rate, or she can pay the entire amount in piggies.
   Into her decision and calculations, she must factor the
principle that a piggy in hand should be a piggy spent quickly,
because it will buy less next week.
   Devaluations of the piggy, which occur each Monday, make last
week's black market rate this week's official exchange rate,
erasing what advantage there had been in trading with the
``coyotes'' who deal in currency. In response, the coyotes change
their own rate.
   Francisco Mayorga, president of the central bank, hailed the
gold cordoba as the cornerstone of the economic revival promised by
the new government, but it has been a mild flop.
   Only $4 million worth have been released into the market since
the gold cordoba's debut Aug. 13, about 5 percent of the total
money in circulation, and much of that is back in the bank vaults.
   Few people use the gold cordoba. Suspicious consumers prefer
dollars, or even piggies, although 900,000 of them were needed to
buy a dollar at the end of August.
   The government says it will issue only as many gold cordobas as
it has dollars to back them up.
   Official parity remains in effect, but real parity began
dissolving when the government stores that sell foreign goods only
for dollars added a 1 percent charge for anyone paying with gold
cordobas.
   Coyotes won't touch the new currency.
   ``Most people who buy dollars from me are merchants who go to
Honduras and Guatemala to buy, and the gold cordobas are not
accepted over there,'' said one, who would not give his name. ``The
dollar is the dollar anywhere. The gold cordoba is something that
only Panchito (Mayorga) likes.''
   Public employees, who received 50 gold cordobas each as part of
their pay, can use them to pay utility bills, which are higher now
that subsidies have been ended.
   Restaurants, supermarkets and other businesses have converted
prices to gold cordobas, but accept piggies at the official rate
and dollars.
   To cope with the rising cost of living, people usually change
their gold cordobas at banks for dollars and trade the dollars for
piggies with street-corner coyotes, who pay about 10 percent above
the official rate.
   Mrs. Montenegro tries to keep up with exchange rates because
there have been 40 devaluations this year, 33 of them under
President Violeta Chamorro's government since it succeeded the
Sandinistas four months ago.
   If she receives dollars from relatives in the United States, as
many Nicaraguans do, she is better off changing them on the black
market and paying bills in piggies.
   Many Nicaraguans feel the higher rate on the black market
offsets the risk of a police raid during the transaction.

   Endangered species pop up in the strangest
places. Like flowerbeds.
   Plant-protection activists say some species of bulbs bought to
decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the
millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in
their home turf.
   ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,'' said
Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club
of America's horticulture committee. ``They're the ancestors of all
of our spring bulbs today.''
   Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners
to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make
up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway.
   ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade,
but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,'' said Faith
Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
   Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of
America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to
avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or
snowdrops, which they say are collected in the wild in Turkey.
   Those three species are listed as endangered in the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora, or CITES. But this treaty _ effective in fighting trade in
some endangered animal skins, horns and tusks _ has had little
effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said.
   Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey's Mediterranean
regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions.
   The popular ``Angel's Tears'' narcissus are being collected in
the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or
somewhere else.
   Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from
the wild in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and
the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare
flowers.
   Some species of these plants may be produced by growers in the
United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check
the origins as carefully as they can.
   This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by
the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to
require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources'' label to
identify wild-collected plants.
   Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label
their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor species and in
1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths.
   Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower
trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major
impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in
the United States or other countries.
   Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall's
catalogs. So even if American gardeners order from Dutch dealers
covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying
wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled
``wild sources.''
   ``We can just hope they won't order those again,'' Ms. Campbell
said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.''
   The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in
Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting wild flowers to
start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat,
she said.
   Gardeners shouldn't think they're aiding nature by keeping alive
a species that might be disappearing in its native habitat.
   ``We don't consider that a contribution to conservation in any
way,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``It's not playing its role in the
ecosystem in which it evolved.''

   Wrangel Island is 2,800 square miles of
freezing, windswept tundra off the Siberian coast. Soviets have
been camped there for six decades, but Carl Olson calls it 100
percent American.
   And the same goes for four other islands flung across hundreds
of miles of ocean at the edge of the polar icecap.
   ``There's no question that the five islands belong to Alaska,''
declares Olson, a crusading Los Angeles teacher.
   Olson wants the government to reassert American claims abandoned
66 years ago _ if they ever existed. The State Department says this
country has never claimed ``Ostrov Vrangelya,'' as its current
occupants call it.
   The U.S.-Soviet Maritime Boundary Treaty signed in June places
Wrangel and the four other islands squarely in the Soviet
economic-interest area.
   The Alaska legislature, however, has approved resolutions saying
Wrangel should be part of the state and calling for state
representation in any negotiations on future ownership.
   Wrangel is 83 miles across the Long Strait from Siberia, 200
miles from the Alaskan mainland. Bennett Island, the farthest out
of the four others, is about 800 miles from Alaska.
   The others are Herald, Henrietta and Jeannette.
   July temperatures on Wrangel soar to a high of 36 degrees
Fahrenheit and the mean reading for February is 13 below.
   A recent estimate put Wrangel Island's human population at 50. A
colony of Eskimos and Chukchis transplanted from the Siberian
mainland was established by the Soviets in 1926.
   Walruses, seals and polar bears and herds of lemmings live
there, too. And Olson recalls an old flickering documentary film
showing reindeer prancing in the frozen mists.
   One of the prime attractions of Wrangel and the shallow seas
around it, however, has been the unproven belief that vast oil
reserves lie beneath the island and the icy waters off Northeast
Siberia.
   ``Looking beneath the surface of the Arctic waters gives us
another vital reason not to give up the area to the Soviets,'' says
Olson. ``Oil and gas. Literally billions of barrels.''
   Olson has created an organization, State Department Watch, to
press the case for making Wrangel and the four other islands part
of the United States.
   Appeals from Olson, a former executive director of the
Washington-based Conservative Caucus Inc., have created ripples on
Capitol Hill, although not lately. Rep. William Dannemeyer,
R-Calif., offered legislation that would bar signing away the
island without submitting such a treaty to the Senate.
   But the bill has been stuck in committee for two years and,
despite a new sponsor, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., appears headed for
oblivion. A similar measure was introduced in the Senate last year
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Conservatives, however, are not promising to make a fight of it.
   ``We can't fight every battle,'' says Conservative Caucus leader
Howard Phillips. ``We try to fight battles where it can make a
difference.''
   He says Wrangel and the waters around it could not only yield a
petroleum bonanza but prove militarily vital.
   Tales of a large island off Northeast Siberia circulated in
Russia as early as the 18th Century and fired the imagination of
explorer Frederick Petrovich von Wrangel. He searched in 1824 but
apparently never found it.
   Its barren shores may first have been sighted by Captain Henry
Kellett of then Royal Navy in 1849 after he discovered Herald
Island.
   But an American skipper, Captain Thomas Long, is often credited
for discovering Wrangel on a voyage of the barque Nile in 1867.
   The U.S. Revenue Marine steamer Corwin under captain Calvin L.
Hooper visited Wrangel in 1881. Among those who went ashore was the
explorer John Muir whose book, The Cruise of the Corwin, told of
the expedition.
   Wrangel and four other islands that amount to pinpoints in the
Arctic Ocean were visited in 1881 by Navy Commander George
Washington De Long aboard the vessel Jeannette and surveyed for the
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.
   The survey placed all five islands in the District of Alaska as
did the United States Geological Survey starting in 1900.
   But the island remained unoccupied until 1914 when survivors of
an expedition led by Vilhjalmar Steffanson lived there for six
months. Ten years later, the Soviets staked their claim and it was
not disputed by the United States, Britain or Canada.

   Bank of New England stock tumbled after a
congressional candidate said _ and the government later denied _
that federal regulators had recommended liquidating the struggling
bank.
   Rumors of the institution's demise have circulated on Wall
Street in recent days and gained impetus with the statement
Thursday, pushing Bank of New England's share price down 62{ cents
to $1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Brokers and regulators repeatedly denied the rumors that the
bank was about to be taken over, which surfaced again Wednesday.
Analysts said such rumors are not uncommon before a long weekend.

   Oil prices settled higher as traders focused on
tensions instead of the possibility of peace in the Middle East.
   Light sweet crude for October delivery closed up 85 cents at
$26.77 per barrel Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. At
one point, crude had moved up to $27.50 as traders began doubting
there could be any immediate diplomatic resolution of the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   But a slight sell-off took over after President Bush praised the
promise of higher OPEC production and indicated no immediate need

   All week rumors swirled on Wall Street that
federal regulators might take over the troubled Bank of New
England. All week regulators denied they were true.
   But when a congressional candidate Thursday flatly stated that
the government had recommended liquidating the institution, the
rumors gained new weight, dragging down Bank of New England's stock
price.
   The episode demonstrated how rumors can move the nation's
financial markets, and how, like a game of telephone, rumors can
change enough to threaten a company's stability.
   ``The problem is that irresponsiblity like this press release
can kill a bank,'' said Ellen Stockdale, a spokeswoman for the
Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, which regulates
federally chartered banks.
   Democratic congressional hopeful Ted Dimauro issued a news
release based on rampant rumors the bank would be seized by federal
regulators. Dimauro learned of the rumors from a financial wire
service report.
   Dimauro wanted to take a shot at his opponent, Rep. Richard
Neal, D-Mass., a member of the House Banking Committee, whom he
accused of ignorance about the bank. But he got the facts wrong.
   ``This is a sad day for Massachusetts as the FDIC has
recommended the liquidation of Bank of New England,'' a statement
from Dimauro said. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. recommended
nothing of the sort.
   Dimauro later apologized, saying his statement should have noted
the wire service report concerned speculation that shouldn't have
been presented as fact. He blamed an aide for releasing the
statement without his approval.
   Too late. The bank and federal regulators had to scramble to
shore up the bank's reputation, saying it was solvent and denying
that a takeover was pending.
   Already fighting to recover from New England's depressed real
estate market that left it holding millions of dollars in bad
loans, the bank's stock plummeted 38.5 percent to $1 a share from
$1.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday.
   The bank's chairman and chief executive, Lawrence K. Fish, said
the ``surprising and harmful rumors that have been circulating
about Bank of New England during the last several days are
completely untrue.''
   ``The facts are that we ... have been fully liquid since
mid-June, operating expenses have been sharply reduced and our
plans for a recapitalization are well advanced,'' Fish said in a
statement. ``Our recovery program is on track.''
   Bank of New England has operated under federal orders since
early this year. The bank came under heightened government scrutiny
when a downturn in the economy and the real estate market exposed
mountains of bad loans.
   The bank lost close to $80 million in the first half of 1990, on
top of more than $1 billion in losses last year. Under an operating
plan with federal regulators, Bank of New England plans to sell off
assets and slash its work force to reduce costs and raise money.
   Against that backdrop, rumors have circulated occasionally about
the bank's future. Analysts said such speculation typically
increases before a long holiday weekend.
   The rumors in this case were so persistent they were likely to
have an impact on the bank's stock, said Don Kauth, an analyst with
First Albany Corp.
   ``It's been a distressed bank for some time and the continued
deterioration in economic fundamentals in New England made their
recovery that much more difficult,'' he said.
   Kauth, like other analysts, gave credence to the notion of a
federal takeover. ``Whether it's this weekend or a month from now
or two months from now, it is inevitable,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the politician's statement led the bank to drop a
policy against commenting on market rumors and regulators to drop
theirs on a bank's status.
   ``Officially we do not comment on the condition of the bank,''
Stockdale said. But she said the incident was ``so weird that we
are saying the bank will be open after the (Labor Day) holiday. It
will still be the Bank of New England on Tuesday. The press release
is not true.''
   On top its major error, Dimauro's statement got an important
fact wrong: Bank of New England is not regulated by the FDIC. A
federally chartered institution, its regulator is the Comptroller
of the Currency.
   Stockdale said her office decides when a bank becomes insolvent,
and when that happens the FDIC handles liquidation. ``So,'' she
said, ``the press release doesn't even talk about a situation that
is real.''

<HEAD>Simmons Seeks 10 Million Lockheed Shares from ESOP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Harold C. Simmons wants
Lockheed Corp. to sell him 10 million shares of common stock and to
amend its antitakeover defense to facilitate the sale.
   NL Industries Inc., a Simmons-controlled Houston chemicals
concern, has asked Lockheed to sell 10 million shares in Lockheed's
employee stock ownership plan for $35 per share.
   NL also agreed not to vote those shares for three years to allay
management fears that the 10 million additional shares would give
away control of the company to Simmons who lost a proxy battle with
the defense contractor in March.
   Simmons' offer was disclosed Thursday in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in which he also reported that
companies he controls hold 19.8 percent of Calabasas, Calif.-based
Lockheed _ up from an 18.94 percent stake in March.
   ``We have received the letter and have no further comment until
we can review the proposal,'' Scott Hallman, a Lockheed spokesman,
said Thursday.
   Lockheed closed down 37{ cents Thursday to $26.37{ in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   According to the SEC filing, Simmons companies spent more than
$14 million between Aug. 15 and Wednesday buying 510,700 Lockheed
shares at prices ranging between $28.75 and $26.25.
   That put 12.5 million Lockheed shares under the Dallas
billionaire's control.
   Simmons, who has been increasing his Lockheed holdings since
March 1989, lost a proxy fight with the aviation concern in March,
after Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep rebuffed his request for
board representation.
   In addition to trying to oust Lockheed's board of directors at
the annual shareholders meeting, Simmons sought to eliminate a
shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill defense. The
poison pill would make it prohibitively expensive for anyone to buy
20 percent or more of the company's common stock.
   In a letter to Tellep, NL President J. Landis Martin asked
Lockheed to amend the poison pill to allow the purchase of 10
million shares from the Lockheed ESOP. That would increase his
stake in Lockheed to more than 35 percent.
   Analysts have said the ESOP, which held 17 percent of Lockheed's
stock when created, effectively blocks a Lockheed takeover because
in Delaware _ where the company is incorporated _ a buyout must be
approved by holders of 85 percent of a company's stock.
   The company created the ESOP last year shortly after Simmons
revealed, as required by the SEC, that he held more than 5 percent
of Lockheed's shares. Simmons reduced his holdings from 5.9 percent
to 4.2 percent after the ESOP was created.
   In his letter to Tellep, Martin claimed the ESOP ``added
approximately $500 million in debt to the company's balance
sheet,'' as well as increased interest payments.
   If Lockheed management objected to the sale of ESOP shares, then
it should amend the poison pill to allow NL to buy 10 million
shares on the open market, Martin wrote.

   A capital gains tax reduction ``could not be
counted on'' to give a significant boost to American economic
growth, the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.
   ``It is unlikely that the increase in income would generate
enough additional tax revenue'' to offset losses to the Treasury,
said the report requested by the congressional tax- and
budget-writing committees.
   During his campaign for the presidency in 1988, President Bush
called cutting the tax rate on capital gains one of his top
priorities. But the Democratic-controlled Congress has refused to
enact the proposal.
   The administration has pressed for a reduction in the capital
gains tax rate during this year's budget negotiations with
lawmakers.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, called the study ``an objective assessment'' of
previous reports on the capital gains tax cut Bush proposed in his
fiscal 1991 budget. Rostenkowski has been a foe of reducing the
capital gains tax rate.

   In Rome, gasoline has shot to almost $5 a gallon
since Iraq invaded Kuwait. Many Swedes are paying $75 to fill 'er
up.
   But analysts say despite exorbitant price hikes, Western Europe
will be less damaged than the United States by rising energy prices.
   ``The picture that I draw is of a Europe that is not as
dependent on oil as it was at the beginning of this decade,'' said
Peter Bogin, the assistant director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris.
   Oil and gas prices have increased worldwide since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2. The price of a barrel of light sweet crude hit
$32 in New York before receding this week, following OPEC's
decision to boost production to make up for lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti
oil.
   Analysts expect the oil crisis to push up inflation and slow
growth in Western Europe. But there is little talk about an
imminent recession, as in the United States. That's because of the
factors in Europe's favor: relatively good economic health; a drop
in oil use; and the cheapness of the dollar, the currency used for
oil purchases.
   Western Europe and the United States import about the same
amount of crude oil per person, Bogin said. But in addition to the
imports, Americans use an equal amount of domestically produced oil.
   ``We're gas guzzlers. That's the problem,'' said Paul Horne, an
American who is chief international economist for Smith Barney
International in Paris.
   Europeans have always relied less on cars than Americans. With
traditionally lower incomes, Europeans bought fewer, more
gas-efficient cars. Many governments developed extensive train
systems.
   Western Europe was still hit hard economically by the energy
crises of 1973-74 and 1978-80. But when gas prices started falling,
many governments kept them artificially high through taxation,
aiming in part to cut consumption.
   Thus, even though many Western Europeans now are as wealthy as
Americans, they don't buy cars that are as big or use them as much.
   ``People can't afford to run a Cadillac when the price of gas
goes to a dollar a liter,'' said Jacques Michaux, the deputy head
for oil and gas at the European Community's energy division. There
are roughly four liters to a gallon.
   In Italy, for example, the best-selling car is the compact Fiat
Uno, which gets about 47 miles to the gallon at 55 mph.
   The most popular U.S. car last year was the mid-sized sedan
Honda Accord, which gets about 28 mpg on the highway.
   In the past decade, Western Europe has also followed the United
States in slashing its reliance on oil to produce electricity.
   France, for example, has become the world's leader in reliance
on nuclear energy, getting more than 80 percent of its electricity
from nuclear plants.
   England and West Germany have switched to coal to produce some
of their power, while Norway exports electricity from its numerous
hydroelectric plants.
   One glaring exception is Italy, which still gets nearly half its
electricity from oil.
   European industries have made a ``huge effort'' to reduce their
use of oil, said Michaux. He cited steel, cement, petrochemical and
paper plants in particular.
   The effects are dramatic. Between 1980 and 1989, France became
35 percent less oil-reliant, while England dropped 37 percent and
West Germany 31 percent, according to figures compiled by the
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
   By comparison, the United States became 20 percent less
oil-intensive in that period.
   While Western Europe is not expected to suffer the economic
damage it did from previous oil crises, there is still concern
about price hikes at the pump since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The increases have varied widely, ranging from no rise in pump
prices in Portugal, to 5 percent in Italy, to as much as 22 percent
in Greece.
   The increases have prompted France to slap on price controls and
West Germany and Britain to investigate oil companies' pricing
policies. Italy plans to freeze prices of petroleum products for
three months. NAF, Norway's largest auto association, boycotted
Shell stations for a week after they became the first to raise
prices before old supplies had been used up.
   However, many Europeans have also grown used to stiff gas costs.
   ``I didn't like it, obviously,'' said one man as he filled his
gray Fiat Uno at a Rome gas station. ``But here, the price is
always going up. For different reasons, but it's always going up.''

<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., citing
sluggishness in the auto industry and concerns about inventory,
will lay off 800 employees at manufacturing plants in Tennessee and
Quebec.
   Goodyear said Thursday in a brief statement that the layoffs
were temporary and the duration would depend on ``the economy and
market demand.'' The layoffs will occur over the next several weeks.
   Goodyear said 270 workers would be laid off in Union City,
Tenn., and 530 layoffs would occur in Valleyfield, Quebec.
   The layoffs will include both white- and blue-collar workers.
   Union City has Goodyear's second-largest U.S. tire plant, which
employs 3,100 people who make automobile and light truck tires.
   Valleyfield has Goodyear's largest Canadian plant. The temporary
layoffs follow Goodyear's recent announcement of plans to lay off
360 workers there indefinitely by year's end because the plant is
discontinuing production of medium- and heavy-duty truck tires.
   Goodyear has built a new plant in Napanee, Ontario, that will
produce 14,000 passenger tires a day at full capacity sometime next
year.
   In addition, Goodyear said it would reduce production for one
week at its Danville, Va., medium radial truck tire plant.
   The temorary layoffs follow Goodyear's announcement in June that
it will eliminate 1,100 jobs and take a $35 million charge against
second quarter pre-tax profits as part of a restructuring of its
U.S. tire sales and support staff. Those job cuts were to be phased
in through layoffs and early retirements.

   Scott Paper Co. and a Brazilian company have
signed an agreement to sell a Brazilian tissue operation they own
jointly for about $40 million, Scott Paper said.
   Scott owns 49 percent of Companhia de Papeis, which manufactures
bathroom tissue, paper towels, facial tissues and paper napkins.
The company is based in Rio de Janeiro.
   Scott Worldwide, a Scott subsidiary, and Companhia Auxilar de
Empresas de Mineracao are selling COPA to a subsidiary of
Industrias Klabin de Papel e Cellulosa SA.
   The agreement is for approximately $40 million in cash and notes.
   ``Our Brazilian affiliate has been and remains profitable,'' J.
Richard Leaman Jr., a Scott executive vice president who is
president of Scott Worldwide said Thursday in a prepared statement.
   ``However, we have determined that this tissue market does not
meet the business criteria and long-term strategy we have
established for the growth of our personal care and cleaning
business,'' he continued.
   Leaman said Scott will use the net proceeds to invest in
businesses worldwide that have the greatest growth opportunities
and to reduce debt.
   The sale, subject to the approval of the Scott Paper Co. board
of directors, is expected to be completed by the end of September.

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. has filed a lawsuit
against the Texas attorney general's office and health department
after the agencies threatened to seize its controversial
psyllium-based cereal, Heartwise.
   The move comes one week after the Battle Creek-based cereal
maker sued the Iowa attorney general's office, contending it has
harassed the company for two years over health claims on Special K,
40&plus; Bran Flakes (now called Bran Flakes) and Frosted Flakes.
   In the Texas case, the state health department has threatened to
order Heartwise pulled from store shelves if the company does not
alter the product's labeling and include potential risks of the
grain psyllium, which the company maintains can help lower
cholesterol.
   Assistant Texas Attorney General Stephen Gardner said the
product may be ``detained'' as early as Tuesday unless the company
agrees to the changes.
   Kellogg is challenging that in a suit filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Dallas.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked Kellogg last year to
provide data showing that psyllium, a soluble fiber that is used in
laxatives, is safe in foods and to back up its health claims. The
agency has not ruled yet.
   ``The only people who view psyllium as safe in food is
Kellogg,'' Gardner said. ``We notified them that they violated the
law in failing to warn of potential risks, such as allergic
reactions in some people, and by making claims about lowering (the)
risk of heart disease.''
   Gardner said he didn't know if there had been any consumer
complaints about the cereal, which was introduced last year.
   General Mills Inc. pulled its psyllium-based cereal, Benefit, in
January, citing poor sales.
   Kellogg maintains it never claimed Heartwise alone could reduce
risk of heart disease, but that as part of a complete nutritional
diet it may reduce elevated cholesterol, spokesman Joseph Stewart
said. He termed Texas' criticism of the product's name, a heart
symbol and mention of two hospitals on the box as ``nit-picking.''
   ``It's a disservice for these people to be harassing and
nit-picking in an attempt to keep this information from the public
on the basis it is misleading,'' Stewart said.
   ``The assistant attorney general's threat is an irresponsible
and politically motivated attack on our right to communicate
scientifically supported health information about our products to
consumers.''
   Gardner denied Stewart's allegations of political motivation and
said neither he nor Attorney General Jim Mattox were running for
office.
   Gardner said that in discussions earlier this week, Kellogg
refused the state's proposal that the company pay a $25,000 fine
without having to admit any violation of the law.
   Only Texas has questioned the Heartwise advertising. But the
same cereal health claims in question in Iowa are also being
questioned in seven other states, Stewart said.
   Stewart would not say whether the company had plans to file any
more lawsuits.
   ``Instead of being involved in this harassment, it's best to let
the courts decide,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federated and Allied to Negotiate $585 Million Tax Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Stores Inc. will contest Internal
Revenue Service tax claims totaling $585.6 million.
   The retailing company, parent of the Federated and Allied
department store operators, said Thursday that the claims were
based on an IRS audit of the company for 1984 to 1988. The claims
are being sought as part of Federated's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Federated will dispute the claims and attempt to negotiate a
settlement, said spokeswoman Carol Sanger.
   ``In most cases such as this, you find that what the IRS
initially asks for and what the end resolution is are pretty far
apart,'' she said. ``There is usually a significant reduction in
the end amount that is agreed upon, and that would be our
expectation.''
   Negotiations with the IRS have begun and probably will continue
through the autumn, Ms. Sanger said.
   The claims mainly involve issues related to the acquisition of
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. by the
Canadian company, Campeau Corp.
   The issues under dispute include tax deductibility of merger and
takeover expenses, deferral of taxes on properties sold after the
acquisitions, and some items not related to the takeovers, Ms.
Sanger said.
   The pre-acquisition claims total $141.5 million against
Federated, $118.7 million against Allied, and $325.4 million
against the parent FSI, formerly known as Campeau Corp. (U.S.) Inc.
   Interest on the claims totals $125 million. But Ms. Sanger said
that could be reduced if there is a negotiated settlement.
   The name of the U.S. holding company for Toronto-based Campeau's
U.S. interests was changed after the bankruptcy petition was filed
last January.
   Companies filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Act are given the opportunity to resolve
their financial difficulties while continuing to operate.
   Federated's retailing chains include Abraham &amp; Straus and
Bloomingdale's of New York, Burdines of Miami, Lazarus of
Cincinnati, Rich's of Atlanta and Goldsmith's of Memphis, Tenn.
Allied's units include The Bon Marche of Seattle, Jordan Marsh of
Boston, Stern's of Paramus, N.J., and Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh of
Tampa, Fla.
   Both Federated and Allied are based in Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Chrysler Merit Pay Reinstatement Riles UAW</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. reinstated merit
raises for some executives, riling the United Auto Workers now
bargaining a national labor contract with the automaker.
   Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said Thursday the raises were
resumed after being frozen last October. About 27,000 salaried
employees are eligible for the pay increases based on performance
evaluations.
   The program was suspended as part of a cost-cutting plan
designed to trim $1.5 billion in costs from the automaker's $26
billion annual budget by the end of this year.
   ``We determined we had to become competitive or we'd begin
losing people,'' Sechler said, declining to say how much money was
involved. ``You've got to stay competitive to stay in business.''
   That didn't sit well with the UAW.
   The Detroit News quoted an unidentified UAW official in today's
editions as saying, ``Chrysler's crying they ain't got any money.
Where's all that money coming from for raises for their salaried
people? Why would they give them raises now when they say they're
doing so bad?''
   Chrysler and the UAW began bargaining a national contract
covering about 60,000 workers on July 20. The union's contracts
with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler cover more
than 450,000 active workers and expire Sept. 14.
   On Tuesday, the union chose GM as its negotiating target. The
UAW plans to use a contract ratified by GM workers as a pattern for
agreements with the other two automakers.

<HEAD>International Energy Agency Meets to Discuss Oil Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing board of the International Energy
Agency plans to discuss the world's dwindling oil supply today in
the wake of the United Nations-imposed global boycott of oil from
Iraq and Kuwait.
   The meeting was originally scheduled for a week ago but was
postponed to allow governments to assess the outlook for oil
supplies and pursue consultations with the oil industry.
   The oil-watchdog body is unlikely to call for emergency
oil-sharing measures or the use of strategic petroleum stocks, a
senior agency official said last week.
   Existing commercial oil stocks are probably sufficient to cover
the estimated 4.5 million to 5 million barrels a day shortfall
caused by the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil on the market, said
the official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
   But some members could tap into emergency stockpiles if war
breaks out in the Middle East, he said. The energy agency comprises
21 oil-consuming nations and includes the United States, Canada,
Japan, Australia and most Western European nations.
   The United Nations imposed an embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil
exports after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. A multinational
naval force is imposing a virtual blockade on shipping to those
countries, and is prepared to use force to stop tankers from
transporting oil from them.
   The IEA's standing group on emergency questions two weeks ago to
discuss worldwide oil stockpiles, prospects for saving oil by
switching to other forms of fuel, reigning in demand and spare
production capacity.
   But only its governing board can make policy decisions for the
group.

<HEAD>State Allows Production of 20,000 More Barrels Daily</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oil producers can pump about 20,000
extra barrels a day because of the Persian Gulf crisis, but that's
still only a fraction of the state's 1.7 million barrel daily
capacity.
   The Texas Railroad Commission on Thursday allowed the increased
production at federal energy officials' request to help offset
potential oil losses from an international trade embargo against
Iraq and Kuwait.
   The commission, however, refused to increase production in the
large East Texas Field, saying it wanted more time to consider
arguments between independent oil producers and major oil companies.
   By comparison with the 20,000-barrel increase, OPEC this week
allowed production hikes expected to cover most of 4 million
barrels daily lost from Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``In today's circumstance ... we're asking everybody to pitch in
and help in this effort,'' said Michael McElwrath, a principal
deputy assistant secretary with the federal Energy Department.
   Railroad commission chairman Kent Hance conceded that the
increase was insignificant compared to the amount of oil used
daily, but added: ``It's a step in the right direction.''
Commisioner John Sharp said: ``This is 20,000 barrels more than any
other state has provided.''
   The major battle was over the East Texas Field, which has been
restricted to 86 percent production to avoid depleting the oil
reservoir.
   Major oil companies wanted to increase the allowable production
to 100 percent, which would have raised daily production by up to
13,000 barrels per day. Current production is approximately 93,000
barrels per day.
   The smaller independents, though, rely on the East Texas Field
and fear a rapid depletion that potentially could destroy their
businesses while not affecting major companies, which have fields
worldwide.
   Commission members said they will again consider whether to
raise the allowable production rate in that field at their next
meeting Sept. 20.
   Independent producers and state lawmakers said major oil
companies were driven by greed to increase production. They also
said there was no need to boost production because the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to supply more oil.
   Independents and major oil companies have fought over production
in the field since it was discovered in 1930. By 1931, 1 million
barrels of oil were being produced daily, causing the price of oil
to fall, and then-Gov. Ross Sterling sent the National Guard to
shut down production for three weeks.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls 63 Percent in July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surplus in a key Japanese trade indicator fell
63.3 percent in July from a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said
Friday.
   The surplus in Japan's current account, the widest measure of a
nation's trade in goods and services, fell to $2.02 billion in July
from $5.50 billion a year earlier.
   Ministry officials said the current account surplus was
continuing a downward trend despite some fluctation during the past
few months. In June, the surplus climbed 12.2 percent to $4.78
billion from a year earlier.
   Officials attributed July's decline primarily to the country's
shrinking trade surplus in goods as well as to a large deficit in
invisible trade, which includes transactions in insurance,
shipping, tourism and other services.
   On an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus fell 22.9 percent to
$5.42 billion in July from $7.03 billion a year earlier.
   Exports inched up 1.3 percent, while imports leapt 12 percent.
Economists said the rise in imports was due largely to increased
purchases of gold and art.
   Exports and imports in the current account are measured when
contracts are settled and are different from the customs-clearance
trade figures which are announced separately by the ministry each
month. The current account does not include breakdowns of trade
figures by country or region.
   Also Friday, the Ministry of Finance announced that Japan's
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped to 2.1 percent in July
from 2.2 percent the month before.
   The jobless rate has been moving between 2.0 percent and 2.2
percent since June 1989. The low rate has been supported by the
continuous expansion of the Japanese economy over the last 45
months.

<HEAD>Canadian Bonds Offer Attractive Returns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the land of the northern Rockies, big moose
and cities so clean and efficient people say they must be run by
the Swiss. But for investors, Canada also is home to some of the
highest-yielding government securities the world has to offer these
days.
   Canadian interest rates have been on the rise since 1988,
according to Lloyd G. Atkinson, chief economist at the Bank of
Montreal in Toronto. ``The spread relative to the U.S. has been
rising since that time, and it has attracted an awful lot of
capital.''
   Yields on 30-day Canadian Treasury bills are running at about 13
percent. That's 5.45 percentage points higher than the comparable
U.S. rate.
   While yields are similarly high in Australia and Britain, Canada
provides American investors with a certain comfort level _ albeit
psychological _ because of its proximity and likeness to the United
States. Plus, American investors aren't hit with foreign tariffs,
only U.S. capital gains taxes.
   Typically, American investment houses that offer clients
Canadian securities participate in the Bank of Canada's regular
weekly auction of securities. The brokerages then resell the bonds
to the public.
   Because of bookkeeping responsibilities and costs, brokerages
must sell the bonds in higher denominations than are available
through the Canadian government. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., for
example, requires a minimum investment of $10,000 in a 90-day bond
even though a Canadian dealer could offer it at $1,000, said Elaine
Williams, a Dean Witter broker in Washington who specializes in
Canadian bonds.
   Smaller denominations are available through Canadian brokerages,
but U.S. investors would have to open an account in Canada.
   Investment houses also handle currency exchanges at both ends of
the transaction.Rather than charge a commission, Dean Witter covers
its costs by reducing the yield on the security. Williams said she
would offer between 12.25 percent and 12.50 percent for a Canadian
bond yielding 13 percent.
   Despite the attractive yields, there are risks.
   The major vulnerability lies in the Canadian dollar, which could
have weakened by the time the bond has matured. Experts say a
one-cent decline in the Canadian dollar would wipe out the benefit
of the high yield.
   Canadian bonds ``look very attractive on the surface, but when
you do the math, you have to look at it more closely,'' said David
Kuhn, a manager at Toronto Dominion Bank's office here.
   ``Even though you're picking up a wide interest-rate
differential, it's easy to give it back with a half-cent movement
in the currency,'' he said.
   Still, the Canadian dollar historically has been less volatile
than other major currencies, experts say. And it has fluctuated in
a relatively narrow band. Since 1989, the Canadian dollar has cost
between 82.52 cents and 88.60 cents, the rate it touched in August,
which was a 12-year high.
   There is a growing sentiment that John Crow, governor of the
Bank of Canada, would not permit a sharp decline in the value of
the Canadian dollar, Atkinson said. But he noted that much of the
currency's recent strength is associated with the crisis in the
Middle East. If the dollar ``were to go back to where it was at the
end of July (roughly 86 cents), . . . the Bank of Canada would
shrug its shoulders,'' he said.
   Though Canada has a fairly stable political climate,
economically things aren't too bright. ``It's not an economy
tossing out very much profit,'' Atkinson said. The country suffers
from a large budget deficit and is on the verge of recession.
   Although investors are demanding a ``pretty sizable premium'' to
put their funds into Canada, economists expect interest rates to
come down to promote economic growth.
   Many experts say Canadian securities should be viewed as a
diversification tactic. And only large investors would need to
diversify to the extent of buying foreign bonds, they say.
   ``For everyday investors, this is a hard sell,'' Dean Witter's
Williams said. ``People feel uncomfortable because it's foreign or
they don't get the concept of the exchange rate. I try to target
people who travel and have been abroad.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher today against most
major currencies in trading in Europe. Gold prices fell in Zurich
and London.
   Dealers said the dollar's rise reflected technical adjustments
in the market, as traders squared their positions before the Labor
Day weekend that will close U.S. financial markets on Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 144.50 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.70 yen. At midday in New
York, the dollar was quoted at 148.85 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose sharply against the British pound,
which fell to $1.8900 from $1.9225 R-Okla., a member of the
House GOP leadership.
   When the House and Senate return to regular session beginning
the week of Sept. 10, there will be a round of hearings that will
include reviews of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, military
deployment and energy policy, and the impact of all of them on the
federal budget.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will be among the first to
testify Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``The members of our delegation will be making decisions over
the next several weeks ... all of which are affected by the crisis
in the gulf,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
who was leading the 22-member House delegation.
   Leaving about the same time in a matching blue-and-white Air
Force version of the Boeing 707 was a 14-member Senate delegation
led by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
   The separate delegations had similar itineraries: briefings by
U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, including military commanders, and
visits with U.S. troops in the field at Dhahran and Air Force units
stationed in Bahrain.
   On Sunday the two groups were to meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
for discussions with Kuwaiti and Saudi officials. On Monday, both
groups were scheduled to meet in Cairo with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   The House delegation is scheduled to return to the United States
on Monday, while the senators were to meet with officials in Oman
and the United Arab Emirates and return Tuesday.
   ``We may be there for a long time, and the morale of our troops
is absolutely critical,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member
of the Armed Services Committee.
   Referring to alternately raised and lowered hopes for the
release of hostages by the Iraqi president, Levin added: ``We
cannot be used as a yo-yo by Saddam Hussein, and that means our
willpower must remain strong.''
   Lawmakers said they were interested in assessing what additional
troops allies might commit to the military buildup and progress
toward cost-sharing by countries that benefit from the continued
flow of Middle East oil.
   Concern also was voiced about Arab solidarity against Saddam.
   ``I'm particularly anxious to learn ... what the impact of a
long-term standoff would be, to what degree Saddam Hussein has the
ability to create dissension within the Arab world,'' said Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Another goal, said Sen. William Cohen, is to deter a flood of
members of Congress to the region that might distract U.S. forces
from their primary mission.
   ``It would be very inconvenient for them to have to deal with''
such an influx, Cohen said. This group will share what it learns
with colleagues on Capitol Hill and hope to discourage further

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem signed
contracts leasing Argentina's secondary oil fields to private
companies, newspapers reported Friday.
   The government accepted 107 offers from 25 companies totaling
$260 million. More than two dozen local and foreign companies had
bid on the fields, which for decades have been controled by the
state oil company YPF.
   The bids were made in June. Menem had put off signing the
contracts until Thursday, however, partly because the price of oil
soared following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The deregulation of the oil industry, including the lifting of
price controls next Jan. 1, is a key part of the 13-month-old
government's program to reorient Argentina's economy toward free
markets and away from state control.

<TEXT>
   State prosecutors have begun a criminal
investigation into alleged groundwater pollution by the Adolph
Coors Co., according to a report.
   The Rocky Mountain News carried the state's confirmation in
Friday editions. It said investigators were reviewing allegations
that plant officials knowingly concealed leaking pipes at a Golden
can plant that tainted at least two and as many as five underground
springs with the toxic chemical solvent TCA in the 1970s and early
1980s.
   Brewery president Peter Coors released details of the pollution
in February, along with a five-year, $1 million clean-up program.
   Officials said there was no current health threat.
   Coors officials on Thursday declined comment on the allegations.
   ``Since we first brought the problems to the attention of the
regulatory agencies early this year, we've made an effort to
cooperate fully with those agencies and have made an effort to be
open with the public,'' said Coors spokesman Jon Goldman. ``But
with the legal actions now being considered, we really can't
comment further.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower
Friday in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices were lower on technical factors involving
deliveries for September contracts. Also weighing on futures prices
was the cost of wheat being delivered in other parts of world.
   ``Wheat is being sold around the world at giveaway prices, which
is hurting the Chicago market,'' said John Frazier, an analyst with
Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   There were reports earlier in the week that European Community
is heavily subsidizing wheat sales.
   Corn and soybean futures received some support from
short-covering following the sharp drop in prices through the week.
   But gains were eliminated by the near-perfect weather in the
Midwest, which is helping crop maturity and improving the size of
yields.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 6{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.62{ a bushel; corn was 2{

<HEAD>Crisis Makes Shipping Market Even More Volatile</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has not been kind to
the shipping industry, whose stocks have tumbled on fears tankers
will be idled as insurance companies impose war-zone premiums and
sailors demand hazardous duty pay.
   Analysts in world shipping capitals say the market, complex and
highly sensitive at best, now also is confused. In some cases, it's
nearing panic.
   ``We can't predict anything,'' said Michael Kokkinis, president
of the Greek Shipbrokers Association. ``Everyone is in a state of
alert, both those who are buying and those who are selling ships.
People are waiting.''
   Stock market shipping indexes have slumped about 25 percent
worldwide since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, said a spokesman for
Lloyd's List International in London.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said Norwegian and
U.S. shipping companies have been hit hardest. An Oslo business
newspaper reported that some Norwegians saw their shipping fortunes
halved on paper within two weeks of the invasion.
   Other Norwegian reports last week predicted a 30 percent decline
in tanker rates. Loukas Hadjioannou, the Greek owner of the world's
largest independent tanker fleet, said 30 percent of all tankers
could be laid up by the crisis.
   ``The main thing that this crisis has done is once again stress
the volatility of the shipping market, how open it is to outside
influences,'' said David Glass, editor of Naftiliaki, a shipping
magazine in Piraeus, Greece.
   London experts said 60 ships, mostly tankers, were awaiting
orders near the Persian Gulf late last week at considerable cost to
owners. But they said there was some increase in chartering, where
ships are hired for specific voyages.
   Compounding a decline in tanker activity are increasing costs
for shipping companies because of the dangers caused by the crisis.
   Crews want cash bonuses for sailing in the Gulf. Greek
shipowners and the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation have agreed to
define the Gulf as a danger zone.
   Insurance costs have increased as much as tenfold, though more
often by three times, for ships in high-risk Gulf areas, according
to Norwegian reports.
   Jane Vidler of Lloyd's Insurance in London said war insurance
rates for ships have been raised three times since Aug. 2. But the
highest premiums are still just one-tenth of the 7.5 percent of a
ship's value some owners paid during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   ``The current situation in the Middle East has led to natural
fears and a good deal of short-term inability to act,'' said Jarle
Hammer, an analyst with Fearnlet AS in Oslo. ``Some are clearly on
the verge of panic, panic built on uncertainty.
   Anxiety has pushed the paper value of Norwegian ships down by
$1.3 billion, or 19 percent, since Aug. 1, according to Oslo's
stock exchange. Mark Jenkins, senior consultant at Lloyd's Maritime
Information Service, said losses reflect the jittery tone of the
world stock market.
   ``If this crisis goes on we'll be in trouble,'' Glass said.
``Because the developed nations will enter a recession and they
will have a smaller demand for oil.''
   He said ships that can carry either oil or dry cargo then could
enter the dry cargo market, causing problems there. Also, expensive
tankers ordered a few years ago are being delivered now and ``those
who ordered them are going to be in trouble,'' Glass said.
   The shipping industry expects some relief as other nations,
including some OPEC members, are expected to replenish up to 90
percent of the 4 million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude lost to
the market.
   Also, some tankers have won longer contracts to sail farther for
alternate oil cargoes because Turkey closed an overland pipeline
from Iraq.
   Uncertain oil supplies could increase demand for coal cargoes
from stable suppliers such as the United States and Australia. And
higher crude prices would stimulate offshore oil exploration.
   Eventually, though, the size of the world's tanker fleet could
decline. Higher energy costs tend to increase scrap metal values
because reclaiming scrap uses less power than producing steel from
ore, which could encourage some shipowners to retire vessels.
   Other analysts said a depressed market could encourage
shipowners to try to sell a large number of ships. If they do,
buyers could be the Greeks, known for buying second-hand ships when
prices are down and selling when times are good, analysts said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Narrowly Mixed in Abbreviated Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were narrowly mixed in a quiet,
abbreviated session Friday amid signs the manufacturing economy
improved in August in the Midwest.
   The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell &lsqb;
point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when
the bond's price falls, edged up to 8.98 percent from late
Thursday's 8.97 percent.
   Other long-term issues were down, but short-term Treasury bonds
were narrowly higher.
   Analysts said a survey of Chicago purchasing managers, which
indicated a slight improvement in the manufacturing sector, brought
prices lower. The Chicago index of business activity rose to 49.2
in August from 48.3 percent in July.
   Traders fear that the Fed would be less likely to relax its
policy and allow interest rates to fall if the economy appears to
be expanding.
   The bond market tracks regional and national purchasing managers
reports for clues about the strength of the economy and the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is scheduled
to release its monthly report on the economy on Tuesday.
   Oil prices, which can portend a higher inflation rate, also
helped put a damper on bond trading Friday. The near-term price for
light sweet crude rose 55 cents to $27.32 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Trading was extremely light Friday in advance of the Labor Day
weekend, and the bond market closed several hours early. The U.S.
financial markets will be closed on Monday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of the
short-term governments ranged from 1-16 point to &lsqb; point higher,
intermediate maturities ranged from 1-32 point lower to &lsqb; point
higher, and long-term issues were unchanged to &lsqb; point lower,
Telerate Inc., a financial information service, reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   Longer-term issues fared worse than shorter maturities Friday
because the 30-year bonds tie up money for longer periods and are
more vulnerable to the effects of inflation.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 1.13 to 1,143.88.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.59 percent as the
discount fell 7 basis points to 7.36 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.74 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to
7.36 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.76 percent as the
discount fell 2 basis points to 7.24 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 1-16 percent, up from 8
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 89\. The average yield to
maturity was also unchanged at 7.64 percent.

<HEAD>International Group Agrees It Can Avert Oil Shortages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the International Energy Agency agreed
Friday to work together to avert oil shortages from the Persian
Gulf crisis, but they said the threat to supplies had eased.
   Senior officials of the IEA, comprised of 21 industrialized
nations, said they expected production hikes by OPEC countries to
counter the effects of the U.N. boycott of Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``The situation is much more manageable than would have been the
case if there hadn't been the increase in OPEC production,'' said
John Easton, a U.S. Energy Department official.
   Their meeting came two days after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and others
can pump more oil to make up a shortfall of 4 million barrels a day
lost to world markets by the boycott.
   The United Nations imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   When the IEA governing board met two weeks ago, industrial
nations feared OPEC might be unable to raise production.
   ``These increases have not only been confirmed by some OPEC
countries, but they are already taking place,'' Easton said, noting
oil producers have ``a certain amount of self-interest'' to do so.
   ``They are getting a pretty good price these days,'' Easton
said, with light sweet crude selling above $27 a barrel.
   The watchdog body said it reserves the option of calling for
emergency oil-sharing measures or the use of strategic petroleum
stocks if the situation worsens. Officials also renewed their call
for conservation.
   The IEA's standing group on emergency questions met two weeks
ago to discuss worldwide oil stockpiles, prospects for saving oil
by switching to other forms of fuel, reining in demand and spare
production capacity.
   French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard meanwhile
announced France will open talks with the IEA about becoming a full
member. He did not say when they would begin.
   The agency presently includes all 24 members of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development except France, Iceland and
Finland.
   France decided not to join when the group was founded in 1974,
fearing the IEA would simply be used to attack OPEC. Its interest
has been raised by the group's efforts to limit fallout from the
embargo.
   French Industry Minister Roger Fauroux said Friday that France
must adopt measures to help the economy through a potentially
difficult period ahead.
   ``We must control the different factors in economic balance. We
must control salaries, money and prices,'' Faroux said in an
interview on the radio network Europe 1.
   Faroux said state-owned Gaz de France would soon sign a contract
with Norway to purchase 70.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas.

   Michigan's largest conservation and
sportsmen's group took aim Friday at J.C. Penney Co. Inc. for
marketing boys' clothing with an anti-hunting message.
   ``The message that kids will pick up from this _ that the
traditional hunting sports are wrong and that anyone who enjoys
hunting is somehow dangerous and evil _ is simply outrageous,''
said Thomas Washington, executive director of the Michigan United
Conservation Clubs.
   Washington said the tags on the shirts and pants were ``a slap
in the face to more than one million Michigan men and women who
enjoy hunting.'' His organization sent a letter to the Dallas-based
company urging it to discontinue the line of clothing.
   Penney spokesman Duncan Muir said the company would make a
decision on the merchandise next week. But it may not matter for
long. The head of the company supplying the clothing said in a
letter that the tags have been discontinued.
   A card attached to each shirt in the ``Environmental Protection
Department'' line of clothing shows a sketch of a bird hunter
aiming a shotgun over which a large red ``X'' has been marked.
   Under that are the words: ``Absolutely No Hunting of Wild and
Free Animals While Wearing This Garment.''
   Pants have a larger card with the message: ``Wild life protected
by man surround the world with pure thoughts.'' Tags in the
clothing indicate it was made in Hong Kong.
   Muir said Penney's, the nation's largest department store chain,
hasn't taken a stand on hunting.
   ``It's not our position to do that and I understand that
obviously is the message that does come across. We are well aware
of that now, but certainly don't take a position like that,'' he
said.
   ``We didn't produce this merchandise. It came in from a supplier
and we certainly don't endorse this position at all.
   ``We'll be making a decision on the disposition of the
merchandise sometime next week,'' he said.
   Muir said he didn't know how many pieces of the clothing
Penney's had bought from the supplier, H. Cotler Co., or how many
of the company's 1,330 stores were carrying them, but distribution
was nationwide.
   Some local store managers in the St. Louis area and in Oregon
already have pulled the clothes from their shelves, he said, adding
he didn't know how many stores were involved.
   A switchboard operator at New York-based Cotler said offices
were closed Friday afternoon for the Labor Day holiday weekend.
Calls to the home of the head of the company, Howard Cotler, went
unanswered.
   However, in a letter to the National Rifle Association dated
Tuesday, Cotler wrote that the tags were added to the clothing as a
marketing tool and had been discontinued.
   He wrote the company ``neither condemns nor supports anti-gun or
anti-hunting legislation'' and it was trying to appeal to the
environmental awareness of young people.
   NRA researcher Trey Hodgkins said he contacted the company after
the NRA's Washington headquarters received dozens of complaints
about the tags.
   ``They were blatantly anti-hunting. There's no other way to
construe it. We're pleased to see he's decided to drop that from
his marketing of the line of clothing,'' he said.
   Washington said MUCC _ which represents more than 450 clubs with
140,000 members _ sent its letter of protest Friday after getting a
complaint on Thursday.
   ``This kind of stuff is the worst possible stuff because it
tries to persuade youngsters that hunting is bad. Kids are a prime
target for anti-hunting messages,'' he said.
   ``Hunters in general are fairly complacent and we need to make
them aware of these kinds of things or they'll wake up one day and
find there's no hunting.''

   The dollar advanced against most major
currencies Friday except the Japanese yen as buyers added to their
dollar holdings ahead of a long holiday weekend in the United
States.
   With problems still unresolved in the Middle East, currency
dealers decided to keep their portfolios balanced in favor of
dollars, analysts said. The dollar, regarded as a safe haven, has
gotten a boost since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2
   The dollar's rise also reflected technical maneuvers coinciding
with the end of the month.
   Activity slowed in afternoon trading in New York because market
participants left early for the holiday weekend. U.S. financial
markets will be closed Monday for Labor Day.
   The most dramatic move of the day was made by the British pound,
which weakened substantially. In New York, the pound was quoted
late at $1.8905, compared to $1.92235 Thursday. Earlier, in London,
the dollar also rose sharply against sterling with the pound
falling to $1.8900 from $1.9225 Thursday.
   The selloff in sterling represented an acceleration of the
profit-taking that began Thursday when dealers judged the time was
right to collect gains made during the British currency's recent
advance.
   The dollar had a mixed day against the Japanese yen. It began
the trading day in Tokyo by rising 0.40 yen to a closing 144.50
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.70 yen. At the end of
New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 143.785 yen, down from
144.10 yen on Thursday.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late
quotes included: 1.5755 German marks, up from 1.5640; 1.30835 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2950; 5.2865 French francs, up from 5.2445;
1,170.00 Italian lire, up from 1,159.75; and 1.15625 Candian
dollars, up from 1.14695.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late levels
Thursday were: 1.5758 German marks, up from 1.5561; 1.3075 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2950; 5.2825 French francs, up from 5.2492;
1.7685 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7645; 1,169.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,160.50, and 1.1552 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1455.
   Precious metals prices pulled back on most markets.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for September
delivery settled at $382.30 a troy ounce, down $4.40 from
Thursday's settlement. The Republic National Bank in New York
quoted a bid of $382.75 for an ounce of gold bullion, off $4.75
from Thursday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold fell to $384.45 a troy ounce in London from $389.60 late
Thursday and dropped to $384.00 in Zurich from $389.05 late
Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.52 to close at
$387.80 an ounce.
   Silver headed down on New York's Comex where the contract for
September delivery closed at $4.760 compared to the Thursday
settlement of $4.807. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.81
a troy ounce, from $4.86 late Thursday.

   Stock prices rose, but trading set its slowest
pace of the year Friday as the market coasted into the long Labor
Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 21.04 to
2,614.36, finishing the week with a net gain of 81.44 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
885 up, 595 down and 472 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 96.48 million
shares, down from 120.89 million Thursday and the lightest total
since a 77.61 million-share day last Dec. 26.
   Analysts said it was difficult to read much significance into
the market's meanderings, noting that many investors were getting
an early start on the end-of-summer holiday.
   Among the traders who were present, there appeared to be little
inclination to make any major commitments.
   The potential for surprises in news from the Persian Gulf or
elsewhere appeared substantial before the markets reopen for
business on Tuesday.
   In addition, a series of reports is due next week on the state
of the economy, any of which could shed new light on the debate
over whether a recession looms.
   One that seems certain to get close scrutiny is the Labor
Department's monthly report Friday on the employment situation.
Some observers feel the data could play a pivotal role in
determining the Federal Reserve's next move in setting monetary
policy.
   Energy stocks were strong. Exxon gained 1&lsqb; to 50; Atlantic
Richfield 1&rsqb; to 134~; Mobil ~ to 63~, and Amoco 1 to 55.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose | to
45&lsqb;; General Motors { to 39}; American Express } to 24&lsqb;; Merck 1|
to 81|, and International Business Machines &lsqb; to 101~.
   Bank of New England jumped 1&lsqb; to 2&lsqb;. The Comptroller of the
Currency's office denied rumors circulating Thursday that federal
regulators were about to close down the holding company's main
banking operation.
   Toys R Us ranked high on the list of volume leaders, down &lsqb; at
25&rsqb; following news that a group of Japanese toy retailers was
forming an association to protect themselves against expansion
plans by the U.S.-based company.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 115.81 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $28.23 billion, or
0.35 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.74 to 176.97.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.34 to 382.03, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.85 at 322.56.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.53 to 381.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 323.39, up .48.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Up, But Don't Recover From Week's Big Hits</HEAD>

   Wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices moved
higher in the futures market Friday, but failed to recover all the
ground lost earlier in the week.
   Traders said buying picked up as the stalemate in the Middle
East dragged on. Early waves of selling this week had been inspired
by hopes for a quick negotiated settlement to the crisis, which has
threatened the world's oil supplies.
   Light sweet crude oil rose 55 cents on the New York Mercantile
Exchange to end the week at $27.32 per barrel on contracts for
October delivery.
   ``The general perception in the market is continued concern or
anxiety that the diplomatic solutions don't look like they're
coming through,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Friday's strongest move was in unleaded regular gasoline, which
rose 7.25 cents to 96.32 cents per gallon for September contracts
in their last day of trading on the New York Merc.
   Home heating oil was up .35 cent to 75.89 cents per gallon, also
on the last day of trading for September delivery.
   ``There is a shortage of refining capacity in the world, and the
situation in the Middle East has really affected those
refineries,'' said Bernard Picchi, an analyst with Salomon Brothers
Inc. A daily refining capacity of 1.3 million barrels has been
taken off the world market because of the embargo of Iraq and
Kuwait, he said.
   ``The Middle East is not just a big crude oil exporting region.
It's also a big products exporting region,'' Picchi said.
   The stock market has tended to move in opposite directions from
petroleum prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, but it gained
ground Friday in slow, indecisive trading. Analysts said it was
difficult to read much significance into the market's meanderings,
noting that many investors were getting an early start on Labor Day.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.04 to 2,614.36,
finishing the week with a net gain of 81.44 points.
   Oil was down for the week. Crude futures took a hit of $4 per
barrel on Monday and nearly $2 per barrel on Wednesday. Gains on
other trading days were more modest, leaving the per-barrel price
down $3.59 from the previous Friday, which had capped a string of
three trading days above the $30 mark.
   Gasoline was down 8.4 cents per gallon for the week. Heating oil
was down 15.05 cents per gallon for the week.
   Natural gas futures closed at $1.500 per 1,000 cubic feet for
October contracts on Friday, down from $1.537 a day earlier and
$1.525 a week earlier.
   Analysts said some traders were keeping prices up as they bought
futures Friday to avoid getting caught short over the long Labor
Day weekend. New York financial markets are closed Monday.

   COMSAT Aeronautical Services and Sony Trans
Com Inc., Friday announced that they will collaborate on the
development of a new satellite service that will provide news
updates and other information for international airline passengers.
   A worldwide communications link for aircraft equipped for
satellite reception will be available beginning in 1991 to keep
travelers abreast of breaking news and international developments,
according to a joint statement by the companies.
   The news and information will initially be targeted at
international travelers and will be displayed as text and graphics.
   An additional feature that will be available could allow
travelers to receive messages from home or office because of the
service's ability to send directly to specific aircraft tail
numbers.
   Sony Trans Com will provide cabin display equipment and other
hardware for the planes to receive the service, while COMSAT will
transmit the service through its ground earth stations and
satellite system.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Prices Drop in Light Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower Friday in quiet
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, energy futures rose; precious metals were
lower; cocoa futures gained; orange juice retreated; and livestock
and pork futures were mixed.
   Wheat prices were lower on technical factors involving
deliveries for September contracts. Also weighing on futures prices
was the cost of wheat being delivered in other parts of world.
   ``Wheat is being sold around the world at giveaway prices, which
is hurting the Chicago market,'' said John Frazier, an analyst with
Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   There were reports earlier in the week that the European
Community is heavily subsidizing wheat sales.
   Corn and soybean futures received some support following a sharp
drop in prices through the week. But gains were eliminated by
near-perfect weather in the Midwest, which is helping crop maturity
and improving the size of yields.
   Wheat settled 4\ cents to 6{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $2.62{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to
} cent higher with September at $2.43\ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents
to 4 cents higher with September at $1.05 a bushel; soybeans were a
{ cent to 3} cents lower with September at $6.01 a bushel.
   Crude oil futures were steadily higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, which analyst Robert Baker of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York attributed to continued concern over
the crisis in the Middle East.
   ``Some traders may have thought the chances were greater for
some kind of action over the weekend,'' he said.
   Gasoline prices were sharply higher, which could reflect tight
supplies, Baker said.
   Light sweet crude was 12 cents to 55 cents higher with October
at $27.32 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent lower to 1.04 cents
higher with September at 75.89 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .20 cent to 7.25 cents higher with September at 96.32 cents a
gallon.
   Precious metals futures fell on New York's Commodity Exchange.
Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. in Chicago
called the market disappointing in the wake of Thursday's price
increases.
   Contributing to the decline in prices was the liquidation of
holdings by small speculators before the start of the three-day
Labor Day weekend, Cardillo said.
   Gold was $4.40 to $4.90 lower with September at $382.30 a troy
ounce;; silver was 4.7 cents to 5.3 cents lower with September at
$4.76 a troy ounce.
   The price of orange juice futures fell on the New York Cotton
Exchange. Prices were pressured by a perception that the Florida
crop would recover better than expected from last year's freeze
damage, said Judith Ganes, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst in New
York.
   Ms. Ganes also attributed the market's weakness to a large
supply of Brazilian orange concentrate. She said it is likely the
Brazilians will have to cut to price of their product to stimulate
purchases.
   Orange juice was 1 cent to 1.60 cents lower with September at
$1.5925 a pound.
   Cocoa prices were higher in trading on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange in the wake of protests in the Ivory Coast, the
world's largest cocoa producer. Cocoa was $3 to $23 higher with
September at $1,274 a ton.
   A protest march in Abidjan against the one-party government was
broken up by police using tear gas. Ms. Ganes said there was
concern in the market the unrest might cause shipment delays or
other problems.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .22 cent higher with October
at 76.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .38 cent
higher with September at 86.77 cents a pound; hogs were .18 cent to
.42 cent lower with October at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .95 cent to 2 cents lower with February at 49.87 cents
a pound.

<HEAD>Bank Assures Customers Doors Will Stay Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England officials hastened
to assure customers their money was secure Friday, a day after a
political candidate mistakenly announced the institution was slated
for liquidation.
   The statement, although quickly retracted, raised already
circulating rumors to fever pitch. And some analysts said the
likelihood of federal intervention with the bank remained, even
though the immediate rumor had been debunked.
   ``Whether it's this weekend or a month from now or two months
from now, it is inevitable,'' said Don Kauth, an analyst with First
Albany Corp.
   Bank of New England has operated under federal orders since
early this year. The bank came under heightened government scrutiny
when a downturn in the economy and a sour real estate market
exposed mountains of bad loans.
   The bank lost close to $80 million in the first half of 1990, on
top of more than $1 billion in losses last year.
   Massachusetts congressional hopeful Ted Dimauro ignited
speculations about the bank's future late Thursday when he issued a
news release based on rumors the bank would be seized by federal
regulators.
   Regulators announced that the release was wrong, bank officials
demanded a retraction and Dimauro apologized.
   Charles N. Cranmer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said the
political statement probably didn't have much effect on the bank's
basic options of promptly working out bad loans and realizing as
much as possible through foreclosure or auction of those properties.
   ``It's just as precarious as it ever was,'' Cranmer said.
   He said the bank is to minimize the bad loans, but it ``just
doesn't have much time. I think that everybody, the regulators and
everybody else are going to do everything in their power to nurse
it along as long as they possibly can.''
   Dimauro made reference Friday to the circulating rumors when he
apologized at a news conference in Springfield. He said the former
campaign manager Terry Weldon was to blame for the blunder.
   ``I may have done the Bank of New England a favor. I may have
done the depositors a favor, and by talking about this issue we
have brought the situation to light. What happens after today,
that's someone else's problem,'' Dimauro said.
   ``He just doesn't get it,'' said Bank of New England spokesman
James Dorsey, who added that the bank hasn't decided yet what it
might do about Dimauro's statement.
   At the main Springfield branch of the bank Friday morning, bank
employees assured callers that the institution was open for
business.
   ``Yesterday afternoon when these rumors were going on our
customers called concerned. Today they're calling up and they're
very supportive and they're angry,'' Dorsey said.
   Dorsey said the episode won't sway the bank from its operating
plan with federal regulators, which calls for the bank to sell off
assets and slash its workforce.
   ``We're making progress on a number of fronts. This is a
recovery that is going to be measured in years and it's certainly
not one that's for the faint of heart, but we are making
progress,'' he said.
   The bank, which has already sold its credit card operations, is
getting control of its credit portfolio and has streamlined
management, Dorsey said.
   ``At some point in time a tough decision will have to be made
with the regulators,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with
Boston-based Tucker Anthony. He said some observers believe if
liquidation is considered, the bank company would be broken up and
sold off in pieces, while others theorize another bank could come
in and buy it whole.
   ``Right now it's really up to the economy,'' he said.
   Bank of New England's stock did recover somewhat Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange. It closed at $2.12{, up $1.&lsqb; from Thursday.
   The stock had plummeted almost 40 percent the day before, and
employees quickly mobilized to quash the rumors, answering calls
and assuring customers that their deposits were safe, Dorsey said.
   Dimauro said he hoped voters in the Democratic primary would
forgive him.
   ``To err is human,'' he said.

   A General Motors Corp. subsidiary will buy an
insurance holding company subsidiary of Xerox Financial Services
for an undisclosed sum, the companies said Friday.
   Motors Insurance Corp., a subsidiary of GM's General Motors
Acceptance Corp. unit, will acquire NAVCO Corp., a subsidiary of
Xerox's Crum and Forster Inc. organization, the companies said. The
deal faces regulatory approval and a vote from each company's board.
   NAVCO provides automobile insurance mainly to members of
associations. It had annual premiums of about $147 million last
year. Motors Insurance had revenues of $1.1 billion in 1989 and
insures personal and commercial coverages and plans.
   Crum and Forster, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., also said it
wants to sell its Viking Insurance Co. of Wisconsin. That company
provides personal automobile insurance.

   Newmont Mining Corp., a gold mining corporation 49
percent owned by Hanson PLC of Britain, plans to sell 3.6 million
new common shares in a public offering.
   Newmont is the largest gold producer in North America, and many
investors have turned to gold as a relatively safe investment
because of tensions in the Middle East.
   Hanson said Thursday its United States affiliate, Hanson
Industries, intends to sell 8.4 million of its Newmont common
shares and 4.2 million warrants to reduce its stake in the company.
   Newmont also announced it will adopt a shareholder rights plan
aimed at making it too expensive for a hostile takeover.
   Earlier this summer, Newmont sold its 54.9 percent stake in
Peabody Coal Co. to Hanson for $725 million, and it sold a 19.9
percent stake in Newmont Australia to Poseidon Gold of Australia
for $137 million.

<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. executive Laurence A. Tisch and his
brother Preston R. Tisch disclosed Friday that they have acquired
sizeable stakes in three bank holding companies: Baybanks Inc.,
Equimark Corp. and Continental Bank Corp.
   In separate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the brothers and other family members stated they have acquired 9.5
percent of the common stock of Baybanks Inc. of Boston; 6.8 percent
of Equimark, a Pittsburgh-based bank holding company; and 5.6
percent of Chicago-based Continental.
   In all three filings, Laurence, who is chairman and co-chief
executive of Loews Corp. with his brother, as well as chief
executive of CBS, said they bought the stock for investment
purposes and have no intention of seeking control of the companies.
   The Continental filing noted that in June the Tisch brothers
were negotiating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
Continental to buy 2.9 million Continental shares but the deal was
never consumated.
   According to the filings, Laurence Tisch's four sons _ including
Lorillard Inc. chairman Andrew H. Tisch _ participated in the stock
acquisition.
   The filing said the Tisches:
   _ Spent $41.8 million on 1.04 million Continental shares between
Aug. 1 and Aug. 21 at prices ranging from $11.75 to $9 per share.
   _ Paid $4.7 million for 630,700 Equimark shares between July 2
and Aug. 30 at prices ranging from $5.63 to $3.38 per share.
   _ Spent $19.2 million buying 1.35 million Baybanks shares
between July 2 and Aug. 24 at prices ranging from $16 to $11.25.

<HEAD>Shearson Lehman Indicted for Securities Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and two former
employees in Cleveland have been indicted on charges of defrauding
investors by making unauthorized trades, state officials said
Friday.
   The Cuyahoga County grand jury Thursday issued 42 indictments
each against Shearson; Sheldon Strauss, a former account executive;
and Stephen Weinberg, former branch manager of the firm's Cleveland
office, Ohio Division of Securities Commissioner Mark Holderman
said.
   The indictments charge Strauss with violating the Ohio
Securities Act through fraud and false representation in the sale
of securities. The corporation and Weinberg also are named in the
indictments for their alleged complicity, Holderman said.
   Strauss allegedly placed investors' funds in highly speculative
stocks without their knowledge, Holderman said.
   ``Strauss was gambling quite a bit with other people's money,''
Holderman said. The state has investigated about 150 complaints
filed by investors against Strauss during the last two years, he
said.
   Many of the alleged violations were discovered during the stock
market crash in October 1987, Holderman said. He said Shearson
already has settled more than $4.9 million in claims by Strauss'
former clients.
   Weinberg and Shearson were charged because they ``knew there
were problems'' with Strauss' accounts but didn't try to put a stop
to the practices, Holderman said.
   The company will not comment until it has fully reviewed the
indictments, said Steve Fagan, a spokesman for Shearson in New York.

   Wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices moved
higher in the futures market but failed to recover all the ground
lost earlier in the week.
   Traders said buying picked up Friday as the stalemate in the
Middle East dragged on. Early waves of selling this week had been
inspired by hopes for a quick negotiated settlement to the crisis,
which has threatened the world's oil supplies.
   Light sweet crude oil rose 55 cents on the New York Mercantile
Exchange to end the week at $27.32 per barrel on contracts for
October delivery.

   The American Automobile Association said gasoline prices were

up from $1.084 over the July 4 holiday and $1.062 on last Labor Day.
   The AAA predicted a 2 percent decrease in Labor Day travel, but

   As tens of thousands of Americans jammed phone lines seeking to

<HEAD>Genentech, Pharmaceutical Companies Start Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genentech Inc. and Roche
Holding Ltd. of Switzerland said their $2.1 billion merger will go
ahead as the result of an agreement Friday with the Federal Trade
Commission.
   The California biotechnology company and Swiss pharmaceutical
giant expected to complete the merger _ in which Roche will acquire
60 percent of Genentech's stock _ on or about Sept. 7.
   The companies said they entered into a consent decree with the
FTC, which conducted an antitrust law review of the merger
announced in February and approved by 97 percent of Genentech's
shareholders in June.
   The decree requires that Genentech and the Basel-based Roche
divest themselves of certain holdings or technologies similar to
the other's.
   Under the merger agreement, Roche, parent of F. Hoffman-LaRoche
&amp; Co., will pay $36 a share for 50 percent of the shares into
Genentech and inject $492 million of capital into the company for
the other 10 percent.
   Genentech, maker of the heart attack drug TPA, will have a cash
balance of $600 million, which it hopes will help it get new
products on the market.
   Roche also has the option to buy another 15 percent of Genentech
on the open market. It also may buy the rest of Genentech over the
next five years at fixed prices ranging from $38 to $60.
   Shareholders will get $36 each for half of their shares and new
redeemable common stock in exchange for the other half _ a windfall
of $65 million plus stock.
   Genentech's stock closed at $29 on the New York Stock Exchange
on Friday, up $1 from Thursday. The stock had hovered at about $27
since the announcement of the merger.
   Genentech, founded in 1976, is a world leader in the development
of biotechnology products and has been profitable every year but
one since 1979. In 1989, it had earnings of $44 million, or 51
cents a share, on revenues were $400 million.
   Roche Holdings, a health care company specializing in
pharmaceutical development and vitamin and chemical manufacturing,
had worldwide sales of $6.5 billion last year.
   The terms of the consent decree with the FTC will appear in the
U.S. Federal Register and be subject to public comment for 60 days.
   The FTC will then decide whether to make the decree final, but
the public comment period will not prevent Genentech and Roche from
putting the deal into effect.
   Under the decree, Genentech must divest its 50 percent interest
in GLC Associates, a partnership formed with Lubrizol Inc. of
Cleveland, Ohio, _ but currently without employees _ to develop a
recombinant process to produce vitamin C. Roche has a large share
of the worldwide vitamin C market.
   The decree requires Roche to divest its technology with respect
to human growth hormone releasing factor. Genentech developed and
markets human growth hormone, which is used to treat children with
pituitary dwarfism.
   Roche also must grant non-exclusive licenses under its American
patent rights with respect to CD4-Igm, a potential AIDS drug in the
early research stage. Genentech currently has a similar potential
AIDS drug, CD4-Iig, in early clinical trials.
   Officials from both companies have said that Genentech's
management and research will remain independent. Two Roche
executives _ Armin M. Kessler, Roche chief operating officer and
director, and Jurgen Drews, head of Roche corporate research _ will
hold two seats on Genentech's 13-seat board of directors.

   The government steeply increased
utility rates Friday and announced plans to lay off thousands of
public employees in an effort to cut the financial deficit and
stimulate an economy in deep recession.
   Hours earlier, President Carlos Menem asked his countrymen to
have patience with his 13-month-old government, which took office
amid hyperinflation and recession.
   Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez said many public employees
under contract would be laid off beginning in September, and civil
servants would be forced to retire early. He gave no figure, but
analysts said the total would reach at least 80,000 of a public
workforce of 3 million.
   Gonzalez said gasoline prices for cars would go up 35 percent as
of Saturday, and other public service rates would increase by an
average 12 to 15 percent, or about the rate of inflation projected
for August.
   He said his ministry will oversee the 13 biggest state
companies, which until now reported to the Public Works Ministry,
and the major factories that until now were part of the Defense
Ministry.
   The state airline, railroad, telphone and other companies must
pay their debts from their revenue and budgets because the Central
Bank no longer will make up their deficits, he announced.
   The Central Bank will require all banks that owe it money to
clear up their accounts. Those that cannot will be forced out of
business, he said.
   ``Argentina is undertaking a profound transformation of the
public sector,'' Gonzalez said in a address on state radio and TV.
The goal ``is a state that is austere and efficient . . . (and
capable) of all the tasks of a modern state.''
   The measures were imposed by decree.
   Menem's solution to Argentina's economic straits has been to
reduce the role of the state in the economy and spur private
enterprise.
   ``We're looking from the national government to restructure the
state, to do serious surgery on the state, and for that sacrifice
and understanding are needed,'' Menem told reporters. ``The party
is over.''
   The Menem government removed controls on prices and foreign
exchange, linked public service rates and their costs, reduced
import tariffs and export taxes, cut the 1990 budget by $4 billion,
encouraged foreign investment and partially deregulated the oil
industry.
   The government also has proposed tax reform and reorganizing the
Central Bank to make it more independent.
   As a result, the increase in the monthly cost of living fell to
near single digits in July from 197 percent 12 months earlier. The
exchange rate has held steady for six months. The fiscal deficit
narrowed.
   The cost has been a deep recession, however. Unemployment and
underemployment at a combined rate of 18 percent is a record. Real
wages have not kept up with inflation. Many families are hard
pressed to make ends meet.
   Wage strikes and public protests about the pending sale of
public firms like the airline and phone company are increasing.
Teachers have boycotted public classrooms for a month.
   Political leaders openly worry about the prospect of social
upheaval, such as the food riots of May and June 1989 which killed
16 people, wounded more than 200 and resulted in nearly 2,500
arrests.
