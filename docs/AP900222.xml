GAO report recommending reduced spending on B-2, background. No

   FBI agents seized documents at a plant where
Northrop Corp. builds parts for the B-2 stealth bomber, a Northrop
spokesman said Thursday.
   The spokesman, Tony Cantafio, said the company previously has
turned over thousands of documents in connection with civil
lawsuits over alleged fraud in the B-2 program.
   In another blow to the B-2 program Thursday, Congress heard a
recommendation that spending for the radar-evading plane should be
scaled back because of doubts about the plane's ability to pass
critical tests.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, cautioned that spending cuts shouldn't be imposed until
after a study to ensure that slowing the program wouldn't result in
higher costs in the long run.
   Frank C. Conahan, assistant comptroller general and a member of
the GAO, told the House Armed Services Committee that the Pentagon
should work with contractors ``to find out what the real cost would
be to delay this, and if it isn't an awful lot, than I think I
would concur in that decision to delay this airplane.''
   Cantafio said he didn't know why the agents raided the factory
in the Pico Rivera section of Los Angeles on Feb. 15 as part of the
criminal probe, rather than subpoena the documents.
   ``They showed up with a search warrant. I don't know why. They
won't say they were there,'' Cantafio said. ``They came in and took
some documents on the B-2.''
   He refused to describe the documents, and spokesmen for the FBI
in Los Angeles and Justice Department in Washington didn't
immediately return telephone calls.
   The Los Angeles Times cited unidentified sources as saying the
raid provides evidence that a Justice Department criminal
investigation into the $70 billion program is escalating after more
than a year.
   Several civil and criminal investigations of Northrop are under
way. Former employees of the Century City-based aerospace company
have filed a whistle-blower lawsuit against Northrop seeking $20
billion in damages because of alleged civil fraud in the B-2
program.
   The B-2 is intended to be difficult to detect on enemy radar.
The effect is achieved through use of fiberglass-like composite
materials rather than metal, as well as a configuration with few
angles or protruding parts.

<HEAD>Part V: Japan Lukewarm to Expanding Business in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu toured Europe
last month he demonstrated Japan's economic might by announcing
almost $2 billion in aid to Poland and Hungary, dwarfing what the
United States has committed.
   In contrast, private Japanese industries, known for their
aggressive expansion elsewhere, are reluctant to plunge into a part
of the world they see as inexperienced, ill-equipped and still
emerging from 40 years of communism.
   A few prominent deals have been done. Suzuki Motor Co., for
example, recently agreed to set up an automobile plant in Hungary,
the first Japanese company to enter a joint venture with Eastern
Europe since the tumultuous political changes there.
   But Eastern Europe remains virtually untouched by Japanese
business. In 1988, Japan trade with the region totaled about $1.47
billion, excluding the Soviet Union. That's less than 1 percent of
Japanese trade worldwide.
   Although many Japanese firms have offices in Eastern European
nations, only about a dozen joint ventures have been established.
No Japanese company has yet invested in Poland, East Germany or
Czechoslovakia.
   Japanese businessmen have a range of reasons for holding back.
High inflation rates, a heavy debt burden and inconvertible
currencies make it difficult to profit in Eastern Europe, in their
view.
   Restrictions on exports of high technology to the East bloc, a
vestige of the Cold War that remains entrenched, also have reduced
the spectrum of trade opportunities for the Japanese, who are
leading exporters of high-tech items.
   Nonetheless, the changing political and economic landscape of
Eastern Europe has piqued Japan's interest. The government has
allocated $750 million for export insurance to encourage Japanese
firms to trade there.
   To Daihatsu Motor Co., however, economic reform and Japanese
government aid cannot alleviate the tremendous risks it sees.
   One of Japan's smallest automobile manufacturers, Daihatsu has
tried for more than five years to set up an assembly plant in
Poland. Although it developed an ambitious plan to build a
12,000-vehicle-a-year plant with Polish automaker FSO, Daihatsu
failed to acquire enough financing and the plan collapsed.
   Last fall, FSO approached Daihatsu again. This time, said
spokesman Wataru Shindo, the company has considerably scaled down
plans _ it will export about 6,000 unassembled Charade models to
Poland.
   ``We don't know whether we'll be able to meet our costs. At a
scale of 5,000 to 6,000 cars, even if we fail there will be little
damage done,'' Shindo said.
   Japan's largest glass manufacturer expressed the same caution.
Asahi Glass Co. has been negotiating with Poland to set up a plate
glass factory in the southern city of Sandomierz.
   The risks remain high, said Asahi official Shigehiko Tomita, and
no commitment has been made.
   Tomita said trade insurance and other Japanese government
support was necessary, but stability in Eastern Europe was more
important.
   ``The political and economic situation in Poland is still fluid,
and the risks great. The country has high inflation, and even
though we think that democratization will proceed, we need to have
some protection,'' he said.
   Shigeki Ura, a senior officer with merchant trader C. Itoh and
Co. in Eastern Europe, doubted Japanese firms will attempt any
large-scale investments.
   Nevertheless, he added, ``As businessmen specializing in the
Eastern European market, we should not be so optimistic, but not so
pessimistic. Economic reform and democracy will give us chances.''
   Ura said Japanese firms differ fundamentally from European firms
in their attitude toward developing the Eastern European market.
The Japanese want clear-cut laws in place specifying what is
permissible for foreigners, but some European investors are willing
to overlook legal vaguenesses, Ura said.
   Despite Japan's reluctance, its neighbor South Korea seems eager
to exploit opportunity in Eastern Europe. Yoo Chang-soon, chairman
of the Federation of Korean Industries, South Korea's largest
business organization, said recently that ``prospects are bright''
for direct investment there.
   ``Some big entrepreneurs have already studied plans for direct
investment in communist countries,'' he said.
   South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary,
Poland and Yugoslavia only last year and has a $91 million trade
surplus with those countries.

   Twelve years ago, Larry W. Smith jumped bail
to avoid a two-year prison term, saying he wanted to raise his
7-year-old daughter. Now he's come home to face the music, but he
doesn't like the tune.
   Smith turned himself in this week after his daughter, Penny, now
19, joined the Marines. Prosecutors made clear his case had not
been forgotten.
   ``He thought that 12 years would change things and that they'd
go a little easier on him. But right away, the state's attorney
said he was throwing the book at him for jumping bond,'' said his
sister, Deborah Sprinkle, 35, who was arrested with her brother in
1977 on drug charges.
   ``Last night he called from jail and said he didn't know if he'd
done the right thing,'' said Mrs. Sprinkle, who spent three months
in jail after pleading guilty to distribution of methamphetamine.
She spoke in a telephone interview Wednesday from Smith's hometown
of Pekin, about 15 miles from Peoria.
   Smith, 40, surrendered to Sheriff James Donahue on Tuesday.
   ``He introduced himself and as soon as he said his name I
realized who he was and that we had warrants on him,'' Donahue said.
   Smith was convicted in 1978 of selling methamphetamine, or
``speed,'' to an undercover officer and sentenced to prison. He
fled after posting $3,000 bail.
   State's Attorney Erik Blanc said Wednesday he plans to pursue
all charges still pending against Smith, including perjury, another
drug offense and two misdemeanors stemming from a fight with police
in 1978.
   ``Assuming he's convicted, it'll be up to the judge to decide
whether any leniency is warranted,'' the prosecutor said.
   Richard Smith, 45, of Pekin, said he urged his younger brother
to surrender.
   ``His main concern was raising his daughter,'' Richard Smith
said. ``She knew her dad was a fugitive and that he was going to
surrender as soon as she was on her own.''
   Larry Smith settled in Antioch, Calif., where he ran a welding
shop with his brother Dennis. Their parents visited Antioch several
times and Smith's daughter spent a summer with her grandparents in
Pekin, a central Illinois town of 34,000.
   Smith's surrender followed a week of festivities there at the
home of his parents, Dolores and Lawrence E. Smith.
   ``He hadn't been back in 12 years and we had a big family
reunion. ... He came back because my mom has been in bad health and
he wanted to put all this behind him,'' Mrs. Sprinkle said.
   ``I told him this was something he just had to do,'' said
Smith's father, 65. ``He's a good man. He's changed a lot in 12
years. He loves his family and wants to be with us.
   ``He's raised a beautiful girl and worked hard. Now he's decided
he's going to face up to his mistakes. I hope he gets off pretty
light. He deserves it.''
   Larry Smith started thinking about returning to Pekin to join
the family tarp business about five years ago when his brother
Dennis was shot to death in a dispute over money, Richard Smith
said.
   At about the same time, he said, Larry Smith separated from
Gayla Kendrick, his live-in girlfriend and Penny's mother. Ms.
Kendrick, a co-defendant in Smith's drug case, also jumped bail and
is still at large.
   Smith was not available for an interview because he is in jail
without bail. The family would not say where his Marine daughter is
based.

<HEAD>Elderly Legislator Dies After Fainting at Riot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 82-year-old lawmaker of the ruling
Nationalist Party died one day after fainting in the legislature
building while rioters outside called for him and other elderly
lawmakers to quit.
   Chiang Kung-liang died of a lung malfunction Wednesday evening
at the National Taiwan University Hospital.
   Chiang, who had been hospitalized for a year with asthma,
fainted Tuesday as the legislature convened to vote for a new
speaker.
   A hospital statement did not say if Chiang's death was related
to the rioting outside.
   But a doctor for the legislature, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the death may have been partly caused by shock over
the violent protest.
   Chiang was among the more than 100 lawmakers who last faced
election on the Chinese mainland more than four decades ago. They
have been frozen in office in support of the Nationalist
government's claim to still be the legitimate ruler of all China.
   The protesters demanded that the aging legislators be replaced
by people elected in Taiwan.
   In the rioting, more than 100 people were injured, including
five elderly politicians who were punched and kicked by the
demonstrators.

<HEAD>Broker Who Embezzled $2 Million In HUD Funds Pleads Guilty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who embezzled $2 million in U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development funds to pay for a
lavish lifestyle pleaded guilty to reduced charges Wednesday after
helping the government win a cocaine case.
   Cy Walker, who spent at least $180,000 on cars and also bought a
speedboat, furs and jewelry with some of the stolen HUD money,
pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement and one count of
failing to file an income tax return for 1986.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said Walker faces maximum penalties of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the embezzlement count
and one year in prison and a $25,000 fine on the tax return count.
   Walker, who once held the HUD contract to handle closings of HUD
property in the Montgomery area, is to be sentenced by U.S.
District Judge Joel Dubina after a pre-sentence report is
completed. No date was set immediately.
   After Walker's embezzlement scheme was spelled out in HUD audits
and agency documents last year, Wilson initially declined to say if
any charges against Walker were being considered. Later it was
disclosed that Walker had arranged a deal with prosecutors to get a
reduced prosecution in return for undercover work that led to the
indictment of Freddie Hyatt on cocaine charges.
   Hyatt, a former Auburn University football star and racehorse
trainer, was convicted last September on three cocaine distribution
counts and was sentenced to four years and three months in federal
prison. His defense attorney contended that Walker framed Hyatt in
a series of calls seeking to buy cocaine.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Niven, who prosecuted Hyatt at
the trial in Opelika, defended the plea agreement made with Walker,
saying that to catch a drug dealer ``you use people who are
involved in criminal activities. You don't sell drugs to preachers
or Sunday school teachers.''
   It was brought out at the trial that Walker would be allowed to
plead guilty to the two counts.
   Walker used a bank's wire transfer forms to embezzle the HUD
money during a period of more than two years before HUD discovered
the scheme in 1987. By the time HUD officials sought to get the
money, Walker had depleted the bank account.
   Walker acknowledged from the witness stand at the Hyatt trial
that he had used the money to buy sports cars and entertain women.
   Walker pleaded guilty to one count of embezzling $2,073,499 in
HUD funds and a second count of failing to pay federal taxes on
$711,821 for the 1986 tax year.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela's release may
lead to talks between blacks and whites on South Africa's future,
but many business leaders doubt his economic theories would make
for sound management of the continent's strongest economy.
   Mandela, the African National Congress leader released Feb. 11
after 27 years in prison, favors state control of the country's
gold mines, banks and monopoly industries to help redistribute the
wealth that is disproportionately controlled by whites.
   Many economists and business executives say attempts to
nationalize South Africa's economy will result in the stagnation
that has plagued Eastern Europe and Africa's socialist-oriented
economies.
   ``The ANC remains locked in the past ... its economics 35 years
out of date,'' said Business Day, a financial daily opposed to
apartheid.
   Raymond Parsons, head of the South African Chamber of Business,
says if ``South Africa is to survive in the modern global economy,
and if we are to serve the total population best, we are going to
have to expand the private enterprise ethic.''
   Mandela and most other senior ANC leaders are in their 60s or
70s and were imprisoned or fled into exile in the early 1960s, when
``scientific socialism'' was the favored economic system among
Africa's newly independent states.
   Such systems have failed miserably. No more than five black
African nations have per capita incomes in excess of $1,000 a year,
and none of those are socialist oriented.
   Yet the ANC contends some degree of socialism is needed to help
reduce the enormous gap between white wealth and black poverty.
   ``The nationalization of mines is a fundamental policy of the
ANC,'' Mandela said after his release. ``I believe the ANC is quite
correct in this attitude.''
   Such talk sent the Johannesburg Stock Exchange falling. Mandela
has since sought to reassure white businessmen by saying the ANC
would consult business leaders before making any major economic
changes and would expect both sides to compromise.
   The ANC is the main black group fighting the white-minority
government and most observers believe it would win elections if
blacks were allowed to vote.
   The organization was legalized Feb. 2 and plans to send a
delegation from its headquarters in Zambia to meet President F.W.
de Klerk and try to clear the way for talks on a new constitution
that will include the country's 28 million blacks.
   South Africa is the world's largest gold producer, and a handful
of mining conglomerates dominate the economy.
   Many blacks see apartheid and capitalism as intertwined, and
feel both need to be eradicated. Many anti-apartheid groups,
including the largest black labor federation, the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, are avowedly socialist.
   ``South Africa seems to be one of the last places on earth where
the display of the hammer and sickle at public rallies still evokes
cheers,'' Herman Nickel, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal.
   Per capita income for South African blacks is about $1,000 a
year, but whites make at least five times more on average.
   Economic opportunity was virtually non-existent for blacks until
recent years. Whites controlled private companies and dominated
managerial posts in the large state-run industries, such as steel,
transport and energy.
   The government recently has begun to sell off huge state
operations, saying they will be more efficient as private
companies. But some blacks, including Mandela, argue the moves are
designed to keep wealth in white hands now that there is talk about
the possibility of a black government.
   Blacks are now making some economic progress. Their incomes are
rising faster than those of whites, and black-run businesses range
from large construction firms to taxi fleets.
   Sam Motsuenyane, president of the black National African Chamber
of Commerce, has earned the respect of many anti-apartheid leaders
with his calls for black empowerment through economic success.
Black Enterprise magazine, which features examples of thriving
black-owned businesses and offers advice to aspiring entrepreneurs,
has done well since its launch several years ago.
   The anti-apartheid City Press, the country's largest
black-oriented newspaper, said in a recent editorial that ANC
leaders have ``to seriously review their stand on nationalization.''
   ``While we agree there has to be some form of redistribution of
wealth beacuse the majority of the people in this country were
disadvantaged by the system of apartheid, we tend to agree with ...
Motsuenyane's assertion'' about black economic empowerment, the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Once Again A Fugitive After Appellate Court Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second time, ``Crazy Eddie'' founder
Eddie Antar is wanted by federal marshals in connection with an
order to turn over $52 million in overseas funds, officials said
Wednesday.
   The arrest warrant was issued by U.S. Magistrate Ronald J.
Hedges after the reclusive founder of the consumer-electronics
store chain failed to appear at a court hearing Tuesday.
   ``He's a wanted fugitive. We have a lot of addresses, but we
don't know where he is,'' said U.S. Marshal Arthur Borinsky.
   Antar, who is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, had been ordered by U.S. District Judge
Nicholas Politan to turn over $52 million the SEC alleges was
obtained in insider trading.
   The SEC has been pursuing a civil securities fraud case against
Antar and three other former officers of the 43-store empire, which
collapsed last year.
   On Feb. 9, Politan issued an arrest warrant on civil contempt
charges after Antar failed to show up at a hearing to explain why
he did not obey the order to return the money.
   Antar appealed Politan's order to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and surrendered voluntarily on Feb. 13 to the U.S. marshal
in Newark.
   His attorney, Jack Arseneault, has argued that to return the
money would be self-incriminating because it would be tantamount to
an admission that the money is there. Politan has rejected that
argument.
   Last Friday, the appellate court in Philadelphia also struck
down the argument, clearing the way for civil contempt proceedings
if Antar fails to turn over the money.
   Hedges issued the arrest warrant after Antar's lawyers explained
that their client was unavailable, court officials said. Antar's
lawyers did not immediately return telephone calls to their office
Wednesday.

   Residents of Cannelburg, built upon a
labyrinth of abandoned coal mines, are not kidding when they say
their town is slipping away.
   Amid reports of shaky foundations and dropped floors, state
officials have warned them not to be surprised if the entire town
eventually is swallowed up. Residents hope to be shored up by
federal financial help or special mine insurance.
   ``The town is completely undermined,'' said Lisa Howard of
Cannelburg's Citizens Helping Against Mine Subsidence. ``The town
is suffering from mine subsidence and will eventually subside.''
   At least 25 of the 60 homes in the community of 150 in southern
Indiana already have been damaged, Mrs. Howard said.
   A federal emergency was declared last October when a
24-foot-wide and 4-foot-deep sinkhole developed under Cannelburg's
main street. It was later repaired.
   But sinkholes and depressions have since materialized at an
alarming rate. Mine and safety authorities believe miles of
abandoned, slowly deteriorating mines underneath the city are
causing the depressions. The Indiana Department of Natural
Resources wants to conduct extensive tests to determine the exact
cause of structural damage.
   Sue Beckett said her home has nearly twisted on its foundation.
   At first, she said, ``we noticed minor things. We had a door
that swelled and wouldn't shut. But in the middle of November it
started to progress.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put aside old
political wounds and went to a lunch honoring former Prime Minister
Edward Heath, whom she defeated for the Conservative Party
leadership 15 years ago.
   Heath's bitterness has never waned. He refused to serve under
Mrs. Thatcher and has kept up steady criticism of her policies.
   But he welcomed her in the Savoy Hotel Wednesday, and they
chatted amiably among more than 500 guests marking Heath's 40 years
in the House of Commons.
   Heath said he was ``very touched'' that Mrs. Thatcher had found
the time to be there. But he found his old self quickly enough,
criticizing the government for shuffling its feet on the
reunification of Germany.
   Heath said he and other rank-and-file lawmakers had the duty to

   Long odds never bothered Sylvester
Stallone's cinematic alter ego Rocky Balboa, but his fans have an
uphill battle to keep Rocky's 8{-foot bronze likeness atop the
steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
   ``Would you like to buy a prizefighter 8 feet high?'' museum
President Robert Montgomery Scott asked Wednesday.
   Scott wants the statue gone from the front of the museum when
filming is done for ``Rocky V,'' but the
prop-turned-tourist-attraction is gaining supporters, including
Mayor W. Wilson Goode.
   ``There is a contract between the `Rocky V' production group and
ourselves that it will be removed on Saturday but they've been
pushing pretty hard to keep it there,'' Scott said.
   ``Rocky'' creator Sylvester Stallone had the statue made for the
third movie in his series about a Philadelphia club fighter who
makes it to the top.
   The statue, its arms and gloved fists held high, can appear
towering from the right camera angles. But in the plaza surrounded
on three sides by the museum and its tall columns, ``it looks like
a toy,'' Scott said.
   Goode said the statue represents ``the struggle of so many
people.''

Center will include vignettes from some of the famous shows that
appeared on the theater's stage and reminiscences by some of the
stars who appeared in them.
   The Shubert's owners are hoping proceeds from the event _
tickets cost from $60 to $250 _ will enable them to conclude a
two-year, $2 million endowment campaign.
   Judith Lisi, the theater's executive director, called the gala
``an opportunity to look back at the history of this illustrious
theater,'' which was home to the world premieres of all of Rodgers'
and Hammerstein's musicals.

   Economic sanctions have
retarded growth, costing jobs and affecting social programs, but
whether they have pushed the government to political reform is a
matter of argument.
   ``We believe sanctions have been very helpful,'' Nelson Mandela
said after President F.W. de Klerk freed the African National
Congress leader from a life prison term Feb. 11.
   Mandela also credited ``mass struggles'' inside South Africa and
changes in the thinking of government leaders for his release and
the legalization of the ANC and other organizations.
   Government officials and white businessmen acknowledge the
economy has been affected by withdrawal of investments, trade
embargoes and punitive loan terms, but say political changes are
being made simply because it's the right thing to do.
   Finance Minister Barend du Plessis stands by the government line
that sanctions did not influence reform, although they cost the
country wealth and jobs. He said this week the reforms de Klerk has
made may ease the sanctions.
   That already has happened in Britain's case. On Wednesday, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher lifted a ban on investments and urged
the European Economic Community to end other punishments as an
encouragement to de Klerk.
   Kent Durr, the South African trade minister, said the British
action would encourage negotiations on an end to apartheid.
   When de Klerk returned from meetings with Mrs. Thatcher and
other European leaders in June, he said international pressure and
economic sanctions may ease ``as long as it is visible that we're
really working to end apartheid and white domination of the
government.''
   He has since ended segregation of beaches, allowed huge
anti-government demonstrations, legalized 60 organizations, freed
some political prisoners, suspended all executions and partially
lifted the state of emergency.
   De Klerk never said he was caving in to foreign pressure, as
right-wing opponents claim, but he has clearly linked South
Africa's internal economic and political problems with its
international image.
   ``The time has come for South Africa to restore its pride and to
lift itself out of the doldrums of growing international isolation,
economic decline and increasing polarization,'' he said at his
inauguration in September.
   ``We are going to open the door to prosperity and economic
growth ... by breaking out of the international stranglehold which,
for political reasons, has been applied to our growth potential.''
   Nico Czypionka, chief economist of the Standard Bank, said:
``Sanctions did certainly undercut economic growth ... but I don't
think that was the factor that triggered the political changes
taking place.''
   He said the black population boom and urbanization of hundreds
of thousands of rural blacks probably contributed to the
goverment's movement toward reform.
   Financial experts agree the most damaging sanctions were those
by lenders. In 1985, creditor banks decided not to renew loans, and
to impose strict credit policies.
   Economists at the Trust Bank estimate South Africa would have
had $14 billion more in loans and investment in the past five years
_ and $4 billion more in export earnings _ had it not been for
sanctions and political turmoil.
   Sanctions also forced businesses to increase efficiency, showed
consumers they could do without many imported luxuries and caused
the government to change its financial policy.
   Most of the nearly 200 foreign companies that left South Africa
sold their local operations to domestic owners for low prices to be
paid over long terms. Few jobs were lost, but many social,
educational, housing and training programs begun by foreigners were
dropped.

   A sculptor told lawmakers he would never
have entered a competition to design a major state statue if he
knew they were going put it on the ground instead of on top of the
Statehouse dome.
   The proposed 20-foot statue, named Ad Astra from the state's
motto, ``ad astra per aspera'' or ``to the stars through
difficulty,'' was designed by Richard Bergen of Salina. It depicts
a male Kansa Indian pointing a bow and arrow toward the sky.
   After years of debate about a plan to put a statue of Ceres, the
goddess of agriculture and fertility, atop the Capitol dome, the
1984 Legislature authorized the Kansas Arts Commission to conduct a
competition and choose an alternative statue.
   Bergen's design was named the winner in 1988, and he was awarded
a $1,500 prize, plus the promise of a contract to produce the
full-sized work for $50,000. He told the House Economic Development
Committee on Tuesday he could have it done in one year.
   However, the project ran into a major problem: an assessment of
the dome's structural condition produced an estimate that it could
cost as much as $400,000 to shore it up so it could hold the
two-ton statue.
   The 1989 Legislature declined to appropriate the money.
   A bill introduced this year would place Ad Astra on a pedestal
base on the Statehouse grounds, rather than on the dome, at a cost
of only $25,000.
   Bergen strenuously objected.
   ``I designed this originally to go up on the dome,'' he told
lawmakers Tuesday. ``I don't want it on the ground. If they had
said they wanted it on the ground, I wouldn't have been in the
competition.''
   ``That's not the way Kansans work. We complete our tasks,'' he
said. ``If I have to go out and raise the money to put it up there,
I'll do it.''
   Bergen argued the dome is sound enough to hold his statue if the
state would just perform normal maintenance and spend a nominal
amount to shore it up.
   He also said the $400,000 estimated cost is inflated, because it
contains $100,000 in contingency fees in case costs wind up higher
than expected. He said he can get a helicopter on loan to do hoist
work, eliminating a $78,000 expense.
   ``I think we ought to go ahead and put the thing up there,'' he
told the committee.
   Lucinda Foster, chairwoman of the Arts Commission, said the
statue is shaped to be viewed from 300 feet away, and putting it on
the ground would detract from its esthetic value.
   ``This proposal unfortunately, raises more problems than it
solves ... unless it is a temporary plan,'' Mrs. Foster said.

   Ask 50 tax experts to calculate the federal
taxes of a make-believe family and you'll get 50 different answers
_ most of them wrong.
   ``Money'' magazine tried it and discovered:
   _The 50 pros figured the $130,000-a-year family owed somewhere
between $9,806 and $21,315. The correct answer, ``Money'' said, was
$12,038.
   _Although the family had some tax problems that most Americans
will never face, some of the experts fumbled such basic items as
the credit for child care expenses, the deduction for moving
expenses and the Social Security tax owed by a self-employed person.
   _The 35 certified public accountants, eight independent enrolled
agents, two non-CPAs and five preparers from such chains as H&amp;R
Block charged fees ranging from $271 to $4,000.
   _There was no logical connection between fees charged and
performance. ``Of the two preparers who fared best, one charged
about $275 above average; the other around $260 below,'' the
magazine said. Over the past three years, the average preparation
fee for an upper-income return has risen by 30 percent, to $1,012
this year.
   While the pros are still having their problems with the 1986 tax
overhaul, ``Money'' found the people who answer questions by phone
at the Internal Revenue Service are doing a little better this
year. IRS personnel correctly answered the magazine's questions 72
percent of the time, compared with 59 percent a year ago.
   Should the news about the tax experts scare you into preparing
your own return, as only about one-half of taxpayers still do?
   The magazine offers this advice: ``If our insanely complicated
tax code can trip up even highly trained CPAs, what hope would a
mere layman have unless his return was relatively simple or he was
an avid amateur accountant willing to put in long hours of study?''
   This is the third straight year that ``Money'' has handed tax
professionals the records of a hypothetical family and asked them
to calculate what the family owes under the new tax law.
   The first year, no two preparers computed the same tax due, and
their answers ranged from $7,202 to $11,881. The second year, the
range was from $12,539 to $35,812; only 10 experts managed to avoid
significant errors.
   ``This year's results were even more depressing: our test
stumped all but two of the 50 tax pros who were willing to grapple
with it,'' the magazine reports in its March issue.
   This year's test involved John and Jane, who had two preschool
children and income of $132,000. Their finances put them in the top
2 percent of earners, and although some of their tax problems will
never be encountered by most Americans, they should not pose a
major problem for professional tax preparers.
   In addition to several errors on the child care credit and
self-employment tax, ``Money'' said, other major mistakes involved
calculation of taxes on mutual fund shares; tax consequences of
Jane's $8,000 loss on worthless stock; the handling of the couple's
retirement accounts and treatment of moving expenses.
   In testing the IRS personnel who take tax questions by phone,
``Money'' found the answers were correct 90 percent of the time if
they were to be found in the Form 1040 instruction booklet or in
basic IRS information publications. But if the question-takers had
to dig, the magazine said, they tended toward misleading advice.
   ``Money'' said taxpayers who have to use professional preparers
should invest in a commercial tax guide so they can take as much
knowledge as possible to their tax lawyer or accountant.
   The magazine's closing advice has been echoed in the past by the
IRS: ``keep asking your preparer questions about any items on your
return that you don't understand. The more questions you ask, the
more you'll force your pro to think again about the issues _ and
maybe even spot an error that might otherwise bring down the wrath
of the revenuers.''
   None of the nation's six largest accounting firms would
calculate the taxes for the hypothetical family. The magazine
quotes a spokesman for the Arthur Andersen firm as saying ``his
firm had a lot to lose by performing poorly and little to gain by
doing well.''

   The owner of a barbecue restaurant who
claims a former employee absconded with a secret sauce has taken
his beef to court.
   Chris Carroll, owner of Spring Creek Barbecue in Arlington, has
filed a lawsuit against Londell Fisher, co-manager of the nearby
Stage Coach Bar-B-Que. Carroll contends that when Fisher left
Spring Creek in December, he took the secret barbecue sauce recipe
with him.
   Carroll's suit claims only three employees knew Spring Creek's
sauce recipe and that Fisher continues ``to serve barbecue sauce
which is made from the same confidential recipe.''
   Fisher says there's no secret to Carroll's sauce.
   ``How can you call it a secret when everyone in the kitchen who
had to prepare the sauce knew the recipe?'' he asked, estimating
that eight or nine workers were privy to the recipe.
   Fisher also said Stage Coach uses a different secret sauce. ``I
think it's a little spicier.''

<HEAD>Some Career Officers May be Forced Out in Army Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army says some career officers may be
forced out as the service shrinks in the next few years to adapt to
a fading Soviet military threat.
   The service's top military and civilian officials told Congress
on Wednesday that career officers would be eliminated only as a
last resort, but such cuts may be needed as part of a reduction in
overall U.S. military strength.
   ``The Army will not dismiss them lightly and break faith,'' said
an Army ``posture statement'' presented to the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee by Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone and Gen.
Carl E. Vuono, the Army chief of staff.
   The report said the Army would continue to try to keep
high-quality soldiers and military leaders even as defense spending
declines and troop levels are cut.
   ``We must continue to attract and retain the best educated,
motivated and ambitious young men and women our nation has to
offer,'' Stone told the subcommittee.
   The subcommittee hearing was closed to the public. Copies of the
Army report and the prepared testimony of Stone and Vuono were
released at the Pentagon.
   The report gave no estimate of how many of the 375,000 career
Army officers and noncommissioned officers might be dismissed.
   Such reductions would be highly unusual for the U.S. military,
which following World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam was able
to slim its ranks by turning loose thousands of draftees eager to
re-enter the civilian economy. Today's soldiers and officers,
however, are all volunteers, and for many the service is a career.
   In a joint introductory passage in the Army report, Stone and
Vuono said movements away from totalitarian rule in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe had opened the way to ``what may be a
significant reduction in the possibility of war between major
industrialized nations.''
   But they added, ``Soviet and Soviet-supported military action in
Europe and Asia will remain a demanding challenge'' for the U.S.
military, requiring that the Army remain ready for high-intensity
warfare even as it shrinks in size.
   The Army is planning to trim its ranks by more than 100,000 over
the next few years, to a total of about 770,000.
   The report also spelled out the changing nature of the Army's
mission. It said that although the Army would try to remain
prepared for a large-scale, high-intensity war on the European
continent, it would put increasing emphasis on the risk of
low-intensity conflicts such as Third World skirmishes and strikes
at terrorists.
   ``Clearly, low-intensity conflict is the security challenge most
likely to demand a ... U.S. military response in the future,'' the
report said, adding that more than 800 soldiers currently are
involved in counter-narcotics missions.
   The report said Army forces have been providing ``training and
support'' to anti-narcotics units in Latin America ``for some
time.'' It cited Bolivia and Colombia as examples. No other details
were provided.
   ``Involvement in the national campaign against illegal drugs is
consistent with the Army's role as a strategic force, fulfilling
the overall mission of safeguarding the national security of the
United States both at home and abroad,'' it said.

   Here is a summary of communications between
pilots of Avianca Flight 52 and air traffic controllers prior to
the Jan. 25 crash that killed 73 people at Cove Neck, N.Y., as
disclosed in National Transportation Safety Board urgent
recommendations on the crash:
   8:44 p.m. _ Air traffic controllers tell the plane to expect
clearance to continue on at 9:05 p.m. The response is: ``Ah, well,
I think we need priority; we're passing out of (garbled).'' The
controller: ``Roger, how long can you hold and what is your
alternative (airport)?'' The plane crew replies, ``Yes, sir, we'll
be able to hold about five minutes, that's all we can do.''
   8:46 p.m. _ A controller at New York Air Traffic Control Center
advises another control center, New York TRACON, that Avianca 52
``can only do five more minutes in the hold. Do you think you can
take him or should I offer him his alternate?'' The second
controller says, ``Slow him to one eight zero knots and I will take
him'' into Kennedy Airport.
   At the same time, the flight crew advises the first controller,
who has asked for his alternate airport, ``It was Boston but we
can't do it now. We, ah, we will run out of fuel now.''
   8:56 p.m. _ The plane is instructed by a controller to ``turn
right, right turn heading two twenty. I'm going to have to spin you
(make a 360-degree turn), sir.''
   9:03 p.m. _ During the next seven minutes, Avianca 52 receives
routine radar service, including several heading changes and
further clearances in its descent into Kennedy.
   9:11 p.m. _ The final controller: ``You're on five miles from
the marker. Maintain two thousands till established on localizer
cleared (runway) 22 left.''
   9:15 p.m. _ The flight crew is instructed to contact Kennedy
Airport tower. The tower tells Avianca it was No. 3 to land.
   9:23 p.m. _ Avianca 52 advises the Kennedy tower it is executing
a missed approached.
   9:24 p.m. _ The flight crew: ``Ah, we'll try once again, we're
running out of fuel.'' Controller: ``Okay.''
   9:25 p.m. _ Avianca, acknowledging instructions from the final
controller: ``Climb and maintain three thousand and, uh, we're
running out of fuel, sir.'' Controller: ``Okay, ah, fly a heading
of zero eight zero. I'm going to bring you about fifteen miles
northeast and then turn you back on for the approach. Is that fine
with you and your fuel?'' The response: ``I guess so. Thank you
very much.''
   9:29 p.m. _ ``When can you give us a final?'' asks Avianca. The
final controller responds: ``Affirmative, turn left heading zero
four zero.''
   9:30 p.m. _ After the controller clears the plane to maintain
3,000 feet, the flight crew says, ``Ah, negative, sir, we just
running out of fuel. We okay three thousand...''
   9:32 p.m. _ From Avianca: ``We just lost two engines and we need
priority please.'' The controller advises the plane that it is 15
miles from the airport outer marker and clears it for approach to
runway 22 left.
   9:34 p.m. _ The controller: ``You have, ah, you have enough fuel
to make it to the airport?''
   Avianca 52 did not respond.

<HEAD>Gov't Promises Measures To Protect Americans From Guerrilla Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is promising special
measures to protect Americans threatened with death by a leftist
guerrilla group, and U.S. nationals are hiring extra security
guards.
   Americans on the U.S. Embassy staff were told Wednesday to stay
home except for necessary trips and were being escorted to and from
work by armed guards, an embassy employee said.
   A U.S. oil executive said his company had canceled all trips
outside Bogota by American employees.
   ``Every American client I've got was on the telephone this
morning asking for more guards,'' the owner of a security company
that protects several U.S. companies told The Associated Press.
   The National Liberation Army declared Tuesday that all U.S.
interests in Colombia were its military targets.
   It has kidnapped three Americans in a week. James Donnelly of
Detroit and David Kent of Indianapolis still were beomg held, but
the guerrillas freed the Rev. Francis Amico Ferarri of Rochester,
N.Y., a Roman Catholic priest.
   Minister of Government Carlos Lemos, a member of the National
Security Council, said after a council meeting Tuesday night that
the government was making special arrangements to protect Americans
and U.S. business interests.
   He said it appeared recent attacks by the guerrillas also were
meant to discourage people from voting in congressional and mayoral
elections March 11. The National Liberation Army has become the
most anti-American and violent of Colombia's six guerrilla groups.
   Manuel Perez, a former Catholic priest, commands the pro-Cuba
guerrilla group.
   Two years ago, his guerrillas began blowing up sections of
Colombia's largest oil pipeline an average of almost once a week.
The line, which carries 240,000 barrels of crude a day from
northeastern Cano Limon field 500 miles to the Caribbean coast, has
been attacked twice this week and seven times in 1990.
   Ecopetrol, the state oil company, said the pipeline had been
shut down since Monday because of the damage. A spokesman, who
insisted on anonymity for fear of becoming a guerrilla target, said
it should reopen in a few days.
   The guerrillas have made their threat against Americans three
times, first in a letter addressed to the families of Kent and
Donnelly. It was published by the daily El Colombiano of Medellin,
headquarters of the most powerful cocaine cartel, where the men
were kidnapped Feb. 13.
   Amico told the Bogota daily El Tiempo that he carried another
copy of the threat when he was released, in the form of a statement
from the National Liberation Army.
   On Wednesday, the Spanish news agency EFE said it had received a
threatening guerrilla statement that singled out Thomas McNamara,
the U.S. ambassador.
   No firm figures are available on the number of Americans in
Colombia, but past U.S. Embassy estimates have been about 20,000.
   The State Department already had considered Colombia so
dangerous it would send only people who were single or married and
willing to live apart from their families. Diplomats get hazard pay
for service in Colombia.
   U.S. oil companies operating in the country include Occidental,
Exxon, Texaco, Houston Oil, Amoco and Chevron. Among the dozens of
other U.S. firms are IBM, Xerox, General Motors, Colgate-Palmolive,
Borden, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Squibb and Kodak.
   The most serious attack on a U.S. company by the guerrilla group
occurred two years ago when a car bomb exploded outside Occidental
headquarters in Bogota, wounding two guards and breaking most
windows in the 10-story building.

   An organizer hopes to lead the first
announced delegation of Chinese students to return home since the
killing of scores of people in Tiananmen Square.
   ``I believe that this is the right cause. We have to open the
door to interaction. Without interaction we can do nothing with the
movement back home,'' said Matthew Huang, the leader of the
proposed delegation by the Independent Federation of Chinese
Students and Scholars in the United States.
   The federation recently voted to seek permission for a visiting
delegation.
   Letters have been sent to the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
D.C., but there has been no response so far. Huang, a student at
the University of Massachusetts, said it's possible the government
will refuse to allow the students to return.
   ``We do want to go back and we think someone should take the
risk,'' said Shen Tong, one of the leaders in the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing who eluded capture and is now studying at
Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.
   He said Wednesday he was willing to take that risk.
   ``This kind of open attitude can basically challenge the Chinese
government's closed-door policy,'' he said. ``It's also for the
American government. We want to show the Bush administration we
didn't give up our struggle.''
   The administration, asserting that it is important to maintain a
dialogue with China to encourage liberalization, last month vetoed
a bill protecting Chinese students against deportation. Bush has
twice sent high-level emissaries to China since last summer's
bloody suppression.
   A statement by the student federation said reasons for its visit
include investigating what happened to those killed when soldiers
moved into Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, as well as seeing
``the real China, normal or not.''
   Huang, a 27-year-old biology student, said he's scared about
what may happen on a trip home.
   ``We will try our best to go back and maybe we will face some
danger,'' Huang said. ``One thing is for certain is we won't trade
our principles.'
   Officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return a
telephone call on Wednesday.
   The crackdown of the pro-democracy movement was followed by an
outcry by Chinese students studying in the United States. Many were
colleagues of the students leading the movement in China.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel sabotage has forced
rationing of electricity in San Salvador and the eastern part of
the country, the state-owned electrical company said.
   Leftist guerrillas dynamited 10 utility poles 70 miles east of
San Salvador on Tuesday, the armed forces press office said, and
the power company said the sabotage put seven major power
transmission lines out of service.
   A company spokesman said the power supply in the capital was 42
percent below normal and the eastern provinces of Usulutan, San
Miguel, La Union and Morazan were also receiving only partial
service.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The outages affected large residential, industrial and
commercial zones of the capital.
   Blowing up utility poles and other electrical installations is a
tactic frequently used by the guerrillas to damage the economy. In
1989, there were 657 such rebel attacks, according to the power
company. Four employees were killed while trying to repair the
damage.
   More than 70,000 people have died in the 10-year-old civil war,
the majority of them civilians.

   The beautiful homes and narrow,
winding streets of this exclusive enclave south of Kansas City are
attracting a less-appealing element: diesel-spewing buses full of
gawking tourists.
   Irked residents want to ban the tour buses. They complain of
traffic jams, street deterioration, bus fumes and flashing cameras.
   In July, Mission Hills Mayor Betty Lu Duncan asked large Kansas
City-based tour companies to stop sending buses down the city's
streets.
   Most local companies have complied with Duncan's request. But
out-of-town companies still send large buses into the city.
   Next month, the city council will consider banning large tour
buses from sightseeing operations.
   ``If you lived on Mission Drive and tour buses kept coming by
your home would you like it?'' asked Phil Carrott, a Mission Hills
resident.
   ``I don't think the regular guy would want somebody driving by
his house time after time after time.''

   Lifelong Republican Karl Hilli says
sending best wishes to a Democrat he respects may have cost him a
spot in the town delegation.
   The state Republican Party stripped Hilli of his membership in
the delegation after learning he wrote to newspaper editors
extending his ``best wishes'' to state representative candidate
William King, a Democrat.
   ``The times are too tough to be too narrow-minded,'' Hilli said.
``I can't just hammer somebody because he has a `D' next to his
name.''
   Hilli worked last year to revive the town Republican committee
and was chairman of the local GOP delegation. He said he hopes to
clear up the situation so he can still serve as a delegate at the
state party convention in Boston next month.
   Alexander Tennant, executive director of the Republican State
Committee, wrote Hilli that party rules clearly state endorsing
anyone other than a Republican in a partisan election equals
automatic resignation.
   ``I think he's a nice guy,'' Hilli said of King in an interview
Tuesday. ``Because I say `Good luck' to someone doesn't mean I
support him. I think he'd be a good candidate, but it does not mean
I'm endorsing him over a Republican that might run.''

<HEAD>Farmers Finding February May Not Be a Dry Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colder weather in the Great Plains winter
wheat area after two months of relatively balmy temperatures is
reminding farmers that it is still February, after all.
   ``Winter returned to the northern and central plains as Arctic
air plunged south and reversed the warm spell of the last two
months,'' the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said
Wednesday.
   ``Rain benefited winter wheat in portions of the central and
southern Great Plains,'' in the week of Feb. 11-17, the report
said, although ``additional moisture was needed in Kansas.''
   The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and
Commerce. The weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but
do not include crop production forecasts.
   Also, the period covered did not include more recent
precipitation in the plains area, including up to a foot of snow in
the Oklahoma Panhandle and parts of Western Kansas.
   In a related report, the USDA said wheat inventories may drop to
443 million bushels by the beginning of the next marketing year on
June 1, the lowest in 15 years and down from 702 million bushels a
year ago.
   ``However, increases in planted area and a return to normal
yields in 1990 will likely allow modest stock rebuilding if use is
similar to the previous two years,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said.
   The U.S. area planted to winter wheat last fall is up 3 percent,
even though an additional 1.9 million acres of wheat base were
enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program during 1989.
   ``While the winter wheat crop in the southern plains was
stressed by dryness in the fall and early winter, precipitation and
relatively mild temperatures in January and February have raised
crop prospects,'' the report said. ``Nonetheless, timely rains will
be needed in coming months.''
   Looking at the global situation, the report said wheat export
prices in recent weeks have declined to below year-earlier levels.
   ``Rising foreign stocks, relatively slow sales in the first half
of the (1989-90) marketing year, a larger-than-anticipated Southern
Hemisphere harvest, and prospects for a large 1990-91 Northern
Hemisphere crop have translated into the declining export prices,''
the report said.
   Overall, global wheat production in 1989-90 is up about 7
percent from a year earlier but consumption will exceed production
for the third straight year. That will drain world wheat stockpiles
to their lowest level since 1981-82.
   But all of the decline in global wheat inventories will be in
the United States. The report said stocks held by foreign exporters
are up 12 percent from the 1989-89 marketing year.

   Scientists conducting genetic experiments with
ordinary pond scum say it may one day be an automatic dispenser of
fertilizer in rice fields.
   But the scientists, who work for the Agricultural Research
Service in the Agriculture Department, said Wednesday it may be
another 15 years before rice growers are able to use the pond scum,
or blue-green algae, as a fertilizer source.
   If the procedure can be developed, the natural fertilizer
dispensed by the special algae could have a significant effect on
rice production around the world, including many Third World
countries that rely on the crop as a food staple.
   Stephen Albrecht, a plant physiologist at the agency's
laboratory in Gainesville, Fla., said greenhouse tests with the
altered algae boosted rice production eightfold. However, he said
it didn't do well in the field, probably because the algae had not
been adapted to field conditions.
   Normally, pond algae produces just enough nutrient-rich ammonia
from nitrogen in the atmosphere to take care of its own needs. The
genetically engineered strains keep producing as long as nearby
plants need the nutrients.
   When rice plants stop taking in ammonia, the algae stops
production before excess amounts spill over into the environment.
   Albrecht said the on-and-off fertilizing system could mean less
groundwater contamination. Tests showed that while rice with algae
at its roots had some ammonia, there was none in the environment.
   If the algae can be adapted to rice fields, Albrecht said
growers could grow algae alongside rice fields and flood it into
the rice areas at irrigation time. He said it would be cheaper and
require less work than with commercial fertilizers.

<HEAD>Broadway's Longest-Running Show To Close</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the summer of 1975, Gerald Ford was in the
White House and Leonid Brezhnev was in the Kremlin, Toni Tennille
cooed ``Love Will Keep Us Together,'' and ``A Chorus Line'' opened
on Broadway.
   But no show runs forever.
   Producer Joseph Papp announced Wednesday that the musical
celebration of Broadway dancers probably will close March 31 after
its 6,104th performance _ the longest run in Broadway history.
   When ``A Chorus Line'' moved to the Shubert Theater from
off-Broadway on July 25, 1975, Broadway was coming off its worst
musical season in years. There had been a series of expensive flops
like ``Mack and Mabel,'' ``Goodtime Charley,'' ``Doctor Jazz,'' and
a revival of ``Good News.'' The only crowd-pleasers were pleasant
if undistinguished musicals like ``Shenandoah'' and ``The Wiz.''
   ``A Chorus Line'' changed all that. It quickly became the
hottest ticket in town. Now, some of its original performers still
want it to stay around.
   ``What I had always hoped would happen, it would go back
off-Broadway and go on forever like `The Fantasticks,''' said Kelly
Bishop _ Sheila in the original production _ during a news
conference. ``Maybe that could happen?''
   Papp, producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, where
Michael Bennett and some cohorts first opened it to the public on
April 15, 1975, discounted the possibility.
   ``Why go back?'' he said. ``We're a symbol of Broadway and
should stay there in symbol as well as fact.''
   Bob Avian, who choreographed the show with Bennett, predicted
that ``A Chorus Line'' will be revived on Broadway in five to 10
years.
   ``It'll be on the road forever and we can all feel a part of
that. You know, classics never die,'' he said.
   The musical, performed on a nearly bare stage without
intermission, tells the stories of 18 dancers auditioning for a big
Broadway musical. They are put through their paces by an unseen
director who questions them about why they want to dance.
   Among the hopefuls are Cassie, a featured dancer once linked
romantically to the director and now trying to get back into the
chorus; Sheila, an insecure, wise-cracking older dancer who
discovered as a child ``Everything Was Beautiful at the Ballet'';
and Diana, who explains her passion for dance in what became the
show's best known song, ``What I Did For Love.''
   Papp said that ``A Chorus Line'' has had weeks when it lost
money, but so far this year it has steadily incurred losses. He
said that weekly operating costs are $160,000 and, since Jan. 1,
average weekly income has been $122,825.
   He hopes that people will rush to see ``A Chorus Line'' before
March 31. If box-office lines are long enough, he said, ``A Chorus
Line'' might run through Easter week. If ticket sales don't pick
up, the show will close before March 31.
   On Sept. 19, 1983, when the musical logged its 3,389th
performance, it became the longest-running show in Broadway
history, overtaking ``Grease.''
   The second longest-running Broadway show was the revival of
``Oh! Calcutta!'' which closed Sept. 24 after 5,959 performances.
It is followed by ``42nd Street,'' 3,486; ``Grease,'' 3,388; and
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' 3,242.

<HEAD>FDIC Chief Urges Careful Pace on Insurance Reforms</HEAD>

   Attempts to reform deposit insurance could do
more harm than good to the nation's financial system, says a top
regulator who warns that many proposals circulating would cause
negative side effects.
   Injecting more market discipline into the banking system,
although desirable, would involve tradeoffs that include greater
financial instability and less protection for consumers, said L.
William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``This is a dangerous subject,'' he said Wednesday. ``Don't grab
for easy, quick solutions or you're liable to blow yourself out of
the water.''
   The House Banking Committee hearing, which also featured General
Accounting Office head Charles A. Bowsher, opened what promises to
be the most explosive financial industry issue before Congress in
the next few years.
   Many private analysts believe deposit insurance helped encourage
the risky behavior that led to mammoth S&amp;L losses. Depositors have
little or no reason to care whether they were placing their money
in a sound institution, they argue.
   Congress considered the question too hot to handle in last
year's S&amp;L bill and ordered the Treasury Department and Bowsher's
agency _ Congress' auditing and investigative arm _ to study the
mattter and make recommendations by next February.
   Bowsher gave little hint of the GAO's ultimate stance, but urged
legislators not to lose sight of the benefits of the system.
   ``Deposit insurance deserves much of the credit for the fact
that ... there was no serious loss of confidence in the ... banking
system'' during the 1970s and 1980s when ``the nation experienced
oil shocks, inflation, ... the worst recession since the Great
Depression ... (and) a stock market crash,'' he said.
   On other matters, Seidman:
   _said the FDIC was investigating whether it had the authority to
curb so-called ``golden parachute'' contracts that provide bank and
S&amp;L executives with lucrative severance benefits if their
institution fails. Perversely, sometimes executives benefit more
from an institutions' failure than its success, he said.
   _issued a new more pessimistic assessment of the commercial bank
insurance fund's condition. The fund, which lost $4 billion in 1988
and declined again in 1989, likely will ``about break even'' in
1990, he said, ending the year around $14 billion.
   ``The reason is we've developed some real problems (in real
estate) in the Northeast and down the East Coast and we don't know
how much, if anything, that's going to cost us,'' he said.
   He said ``at this time'' the agency does not expect any major
bank failures among institutions currently reporting increased
losses.
   Both Bowsher and Seidman conceded the failure of hundreds of
banks and S&amp;Ls in recent years make it clear the government's
exposure to loss must be limited.
   However, Seidman warned, ``depositors must experience real
losses to develop real market discipline.'' He added, ``no one
really knows what would happen if a large bank were allowed to
default on deposit obligations.''
   So far, regulators have been unwilling to risk the chance that a
failure of a big bank would bring down the entire financial system
   He said one of the most common reform proposals _ reducing the
$100,000 insurance limit _ would probably be ineffective. Most
depositors would simply divide their money into smaller chunks and
spread it among more institutions.
   A rule limiting depositors to just one insured account among all
banks and S&amp;Ls would be difficult to administer, he said.
   Nevertheless, Reps. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the chairman of
the committee, said Congress must consider reducing the $100,000
deposit insurance limit, arguing it ``is too broad and has gotten
away from its original purpose _ protection of the small
depositor.'' But he said legislation was unlikely until next year,
after completion of the GAO and Treasury studies.
   Both Gonzalez and Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the panel's
senior Republican, said expansion of bank investment powers, long
sought by the industry, will not be considered separately from
deposit insurance reform.

   Divers pulled five bodies out of
frigid Convict Lake Wednesday, but officials said the effort to
recover the last of seven people who fell through thin ice would be
suspended indefinitely.
   ``Search efforts have been suspended tomorrow, due to loss of
resources and safety factors,'' Mono County Sheriff Martin A.
Strelneck said late Wednesday. ``The divers are getting tired and
cold, and it's getting dangerous out there for them''
   Rescue divers planned to rest and regroup before resuming the
search for the body of Dave Meyers, 53, of Bishop, Strelneck said.
   Two bodies were brought to shore wrapped in yellow plastic bags
moments before two more bodies were found at a depth of 100 feet by
an underwater video camera used in the search, said Mono County
sheriff's spokeswoman Gail Merritt.
   A fifth body was hauled out before the search and recovery
operation was called off for the night.
   On Tuesday, the body of Forest Service ranger Clayton Cutter,
31, was pulled from the water by searchers pulling on a rope still
clutched in the victim's frozen hands.
   Sixteen teen-agers and two adults from Camp O'Neal, a
residential facility for troubled youths, were on a Presidents Day
outing Monday when four of the youths plunged through the ice on
the lake at the 7,500-foot level in the eastern Sierra Nevada.
   A 15-year-old managed to pull himself out of the water, but four
adults died when they attempted to rescue the others.
   The five victims whose remains were recovered Wednesday were
identified as: Randy Porter, 39, of June Lake; Vidar Anderson, 58,
of Long Valley; David Christopher Sellers, 15, of Tulare; Shawn
Rayne Diaz, 15, of Dinuba; and Ryan Charles McCanless, 13, of
Redlands.
   A preliminary sheriff's department investigation, completed
Wednesday, said the teen-agers were playing, not skating, on the
ice-covered lake, which is a mile long and a quarter-mile wide.
   Sheriff's investigator John Rutkowski said he was trying to
determine whether the teen-agers were properly supervised. ``These
are the things we're trying to find out: How much supervision did
they have? Were they out on the ice alone? How many were out on the
ice at one time?''
   Judging ice thickness is left to individual common sense at the
hundreds of lakes in the rugged Sierra Nevada Range, said Fred
Richter, nordic supervisor for the local U.S. Forest Service office.
   But Tracey Wood, a friend of Clayton Cutter, the Forest Service
ranger whose body was recovered from the lake Tuesday, argued:
``They definitely need signs out there.''
   ``I know people are going to be rebellious, but before they
advertise a lake for ice skating they better let people know how
thin the ice is,'' she said. Ice skating is encouraged in Convict
Lake brochures.
   The six-member Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deep-sea
diving team joined 11 divers from Washoe County, Nev., in the
retrieval operation Wednesday, Merritt said.
   ``We've got state-of-the-art stuff up here now. We're sure we
will find them all now,'' Merritt said.
   The Los Angeles dive team, wearing helmets and outfitted with
surface air equipment that allows them to stay down for up to 30
minutes, used the video camera to guide them on the bottom of the
140-foot-deep lake.
   ``We really welcome this help,'' said Merritt.
   The Nevada divers could dive no deeper than 50 feet and
withstand only 10 minutes in the icy water.
   Camp O'Neal is a private, non-profit residential camp that
usually provides education and vocational training for troubled
youth, who are referred from throughout the state.
   Convict Lake, just south of the Mammoth ski resort about 250
miles north of Los Angeles, got its name from a shootout between a
posse and escaped convicts in the late 1800s.
   Twenty-nine convicts escaped from a Carson City, Nev., prison
and six of them fled south and killed a mail rider. A local posse
caught up with the convicts at Monte Diablo Creek, now Convict
Lake, and posse leader Robert Morrison was killed in a gunfight.
The convicts escaped, but three of them were captured a few days
later. Two of the recaptured convicts were lynched en route to jail
at Carson City.

<HEAD>Government Weather Map Includes ``Microclimates'' for Gardeners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new map unveiled by the Agriculture
Department today shows detailed temperature zones across the nation
to aid home gardeners and nursery operators.
   The new Plant Hardiness Zone Map, updated for the first time in
25 years, shows detailed markings and information for all 50
states, including Alaska and Hawaii for the first time.
   Also, for the first time, small areas of ``microclimates'' are
indicated, said H. Marc Cathey, director of the department's
National Arboretum, who oversaw revision of the map.
   These are cool pockets caused by mountaintop elevations and hot
spots in cities or protected valleys, he said. For example, the map
shows tiny microclimates scattered throughout the Rocky Mountain
area and the Northeast.
   Although less concentrated, the microclimates also are shown in
the Great Plains, Corn Belt and other regions of the country. Some
of them cover parts of several counties, while others are confined
to small portions of single counties.
   Commercial nurseries use the average minimum temperatures
designated by the map's zones to determine when plants should be
shipped to different parts of the country.
   Plant varieties are often catalogued by the zones in which they
will survive and thrive.
   Cathey said the map also includes Canada and Mexico.
   ``Our borders are contiguous and we share many plants, both
native and introduced,'' he said in a statement issued by the
department's Agricultural Research Service. ``It is appropriate not
to isolate the U.S. when talking about climate.''
   The map unfolds to four feet by four feet and has 11 color-coded
zones based on 10-degree Fahrenheit differences in average annual
minimum temperatures. Each zone is divided into A and B regions
based on 5-degree differences.
   Zone 11 is new, representing an almost frost-free zone on the
southern tip of Florida, southern California, all but the
mountainous areas of Hawaii, most of the coastline of the Yucatan
in Mexico, the southern Baja peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico.
   Information from 14,500 weather stations went into the project,
more than twice as many stations used for maps produced in 1960 and
1965.
   Cathey said there are no signs that might represent global
warming. But on both coasts, particularly in the Southeast,
temperatures are 5 to 10 degrees cooler in the winter than
indicated on the previous map.
   The new information used to create the map allowed the borders
of the zones to be drawn in much more detail than before and are
more precise, with intricate edges where the zones interweave.
   Cathey said the new map ``should eliminate some of the
inconsistencies between gardeners' experiences with local weather
and the previous map.''
   Meteorologist Mark Kramer of Meteorological Evaluation Services,
Amityville, N.Y., a private firm which analyzed the data for the
department, said the new map ``tells us the weather has changed,
but we don't know whether the climate is changing.'' Weather, he
said, is day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year, while climate
represents a longer term, starting with about 30 years.
   Copies of the map are available for $6.50 each from the
Government Printing Office, miscellaneous publication 1475, stock
number 001-00004550-04, the agency said. The Washington phone
number is (202) 783-3238.

<TEXT>
   Faulty brakes that consumers blame for more
than 100 accidents may lead to a recall of some General Motors
cars, although the company is resisting, the government says.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said
Wednesday that GM rejected the agency's request to issue a
voluntary recall. The agency said it was opening a formal safety
defect investigation ``to prepare for a possible government-ordered
recall.''
   The probe covers 175,000 Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds
from the 1982 through 1986 model years. It also covers 273,000
Pontiac Fieros from the 1984 through 1986 model years.
   Rear disc brakes on many of the vehicles do not adjust
automatically as the brake pads wear, the agency said in a
statement.
   ``As a result, the rear brakes may become less effective in
stopping a moving car, and the parking brake may be unable to hold
a parked car on a slope,'' it said. ``There are no warning signs of
the parking brake problem.''
   The brake warning light might be activated, depending on the
extent of brake pad wear and how hard the driver presses the pedal.
But it sometimes illuminates only during emergency stops when the
driver is exerting full force on the brake, the statement said.
   A vehicle typically develops the problem after about 18,600
miles on the road.
   The agency said it received 42 complaints from owners, including
14 reported crashes and five injuries. General Motors has reported
129 accidents, 13 injuries and two deaths that owners blame on the
brake problem.
   ``We will continue to cooperate'' with the agency, GM spokesman
Tom Pyden said. ``The investigation will offer both parties the
opportunity to exchange and review additional technical data on
this subject. From there, we can work together toward a resolution
of this matter.''

   Viewers in 12 cities watched as doctors
reconstructed a 15-month-old girl's skull on live television, but
the infant's parents chose to watch ``The Wizard of Oz'' instead.
   Surgeons successfully reshaped the infant's skull Tuesday night
to correct a rare disorder, plagiocephaly, which causes the seams
in the skull to close prematurely. The result is facial deformity
and the threat of serious vision problems.
   The patient, Michele Miller, daughter of Lynn and Paul Miller of
the Princeton, N.J., area, was born with the condition.
   Michele's parents sat out the two-hour procedure in a hospital
waiting room watching the classic movie starring Judy Garland as a
young girl who dreams of visiting the mythical land of Oz.
   The operation was televized live by WHYY in Philadelphia and
carried by 11 other public television stations, including WQED in
Pittsburgh, WGBX in Boston and KERA in Dallas. Fifteen other
stations taped the program for later broadcast.
   WHYY's first live broadcast of an operation, spinal surgery
conducted June 19, gave the station at that time its highest
ratings ever for a local production and prompted WHYY to plan
Tuesday's program.
   ``We felt this one had an educational mission,'' said WHYY
director Mike Quattrone. ``This is something that can be corrected.
... What we want to do is de-mystify something, take away the
fears.''
   At the end of the program, viewers were invited to call the
Philadelphia television station with their comments. Tina Brock of
WHYY said at least 100 calls came in within the first 25 minutes.
   One man said, ``This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen on
television,'' according to Brock.
   A boy called long distance from New York to say the program was
``awesome,'' Brock said.
   Some callers said at first they found the operation difficult to
watch, but were drawn into the medical procedures by the surgeons'
clear explanations.
   ``It went really well,'' plastic surgeon Linton A. Whitaker
said. ``There were no great problems, although the child was a
little older than the ideal (of six to nine months). It still works
very well up to about 18 months, but the bone's a little thicker, a
little harder to cut.''
   During the operation, the surgeons reshaped Michele's skull and
reconstructed the area around her left eye.
   ``She might have been OK as far as vision, but the side of the
head was definitely abnormal,'' Whitaker said. ``Her parents
recognized it at birth.''
   Prior to the surgery, the left side of her face was slightly
flattened.
   Michele's parents agreed to allow the operation to be televised
in hopes of reaching others who have children with plagiocephaly
and may not realize it or know that corrective surgery is available.
   ``Maybe you think something is wrong, but you don't say
anything,'' Lynn Miller said. ``... Had I known that surgery was an
option, I would have taken her sooner.''
   Whitaker said Michele should be discharged from the hospital
within a week. The only scar will be on top of her head.
   Public televisions stations that plan to show the program at a
later date are: WLVT in Allentown, Pa.; KQEC in San Francisco; KTCA
in St. Paul, Minn.; WCFE in Plattsburgh, N.Y.; South Dakota Public
Television; KNPB in Reno, Nev.; WMVT in Milwaukee; KNME in
Albuquerque, N.M.; WGVU in Grand Rapids, Mich.; WSKG in Binghamton,
N.Y.; KCWC in Riverton, N.Y.; WENH in New Hampshire; KTEH in San
Jose, Calif.; WFYI in Indianapolis; and KYIE in Sacramento, Calif.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Indicted Mayor Holds Core Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beleaguered Mayor Marion Barry would lead a
mayoral primary race against all other candidates, including Jesse
Jackson, with support from 25 percent of registered Democratic
voters, according to a Washington Post poll released today.
   The Post poll, the latest taken since Barry's Jan. 18 arrest on
a cocaine possession charge, found seven of 10 city Democrats
believe the mayor should not seek a fourth term and 40 percent
think he should resign immediately.
   But the survey also showed Barry still holds a solid core of
support, giving him the edge over other candidates in the crowded
field of declared and potential Democratic contenders.
   Jackson, who has been reportedly weighing a run on the mayor's
office but says he won't oppose Barry, was second with 19 percent.
Jackson was supported by 26 percent of the respondents when Barry
was removed from the field in the poll.
   City Councilman John Ray was supported by 14 percent of the full
Democratic field; Council Chairman David Clarke had 12 percent;
congressional Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., had 11 percent; and
other candidates had less than 10 percent each. Fauntroy has said
only that he is considering the mayor's race.
   Barry, who was indicted last week on perjury and drug charges,
is in a Florida clinic for treatment of what he says is an alcohol
problem. He plans to move to Fenwick Hall, a treatment center
outside Charleston, S.C., later this week.
   The mayor has not said whether he will run again.
   The telephone survey of 800 self-described registered Democrats
was conducted Feb. 16-19. It had a margin of error of plus or minus
4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Oblong Turned Out To Be Modern Stomach Stone, Not Fossilized Egg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oblong object that officials last
year proclaimed to be a fossilized egg up to 16 million years old
has turned out to be a stomach stone from a modern mammal, possibly
a cow.
   ``Mother Nature fooled us,'' said Mike O'Neill, a U.S. Bureau of
Land Management fossil expert.
   O'Neill said he concluded after two months of study that the
surface of the egg-shaped object was made up of calcium phosphate
rather than the calcium carbonate it should have contained had it
been an ancient fossil.
   Denver paleontologist Karl Hirsch, when consulted, suggested the
object might be a stomach stone, O'Neill said.
   ``He told me about some papers that had been written on those,
so I went to the library and did research, and it matched up,''
O'Neill said.
   Stomach stones are formed in ruminants, such as cattle, deer or
goats, when foreign objects enter their digestive tracts, O'Neill
said. The object becomes chemically coated.
   The stone, found by a Forest Service wildlife specialists last
fall in Carson National Forest, probably had been on the ground for
three to five years, O'Neill said.

<HEAD>Ortega Rejects Communism, Capitalism in Huge Campaign-Closing
Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega rejected
communism and capitalism and asked God for ``wisdom to govern'' in
a rousing speech before 300,000 people that closed the Sandinista
party's election campaign.
   He told the crowd that he expects a Sandinista victory over the
U.S.-backed opposition coalition in Sunday's elections to finally
bring ``respectful'' relations with the United States after a
decade of contempt.
   Members of the wildly cheering crowd waved waving black-and-red
Sandinista flags and chanting ``Daniel! Daniel!''
   Behind Ortega on a terraced reviewing stand on the shores of
Lake Managua were other leaders of the leftist Sandinistas,
international election observers, journalists and Bianca Jagger,
ex-wife of rock star Mick Jagger.
   Wednesday's rally was the second largest in Nicaraguan history,
surpassed only by one during Pope John Paul II's 1983 visit.
Streams of people flowed through town, dancing to rock, reggae and
brass bands along the streets.
   In his speech, Ortega equated his main rival in Sunday's voting,
the United National Opposition, with the U.S.-supported Contra
rebels who have hounded his government since 1981 but not posed a
serious threat for months.
   He said the rebel force and the opposition coalition, which
Ortega grouped as the heirs of ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza,
had caused harm to Nicaragua.
   ``But on February 26, once we win the elections, I'm going to
send them the bill and I'll tell them that since the debt is so
large and unpayable, we are going to forgive it,'' Ortega told
supporters.
   The rally marked the official end of campaigning; a three-day
cooling off period begins today.
   The election is seen as a referendum on 10 years of Sandinista
rule.
   Voters will choose among 10 presidential candidates, although
only Ortega and the opposition coalition candidate, Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, have a chance to win.
   The 1.75 million registered voters will also select a
vice-president, 90 National Assembly delegates, representatives for
144 town and city councils and two regional councils for the
Atlantic Coast.
   The Organization of American States, the United Nations and a
host of other groups will field 1,500 election observers to ensure
the balloting is fair.
   In a speech sprinkled with religious allusions, Ortega told the
crowd Wednesday night that the Sandinista Front has its roots in
Christianity because it chooses to side with the poor of this
predominantly Roman Catholic country.
   He quoted a passage from the Bible in which Solomon asks God for
wisdom.
   ``I say: Lord, give me wisdom to govern, give me wisdom to be
just, give me wisdom to forgive,'' Ortega said.
   He called the Sandinista revolution unique and said he hoped it
would become ``an example to the people of Latin America and the
world.''
   ``Here neither the communist model nor the capitalist model is
any good. The Sandinista model is the one that belongs to
Nicaraguans,'' Ortega said. ``That's what revolutionary knowledge
and experience tell us, that we don't have to copy anybody.''
   In the past, the Sandinistas have expropriated land and major
industries from private owners and nationalized them. Most
recently, in June, they seized three major sugar refining plants
and three coffee plantations.
   The Sandinista rally drew truck- and busloads of supporters from
as far away as Boaco, 60 miles to the east.
   Richard Boldan, a farmer from the Boaco area, agreed the economy
had been bad _ inflation was 1,700 percent last year _ but said his
lot had improved under the Sandinistas.
   ``If the situation has been difficult, it is because of the
war,'' said Boldan, referring to the long guerrilla war waged by
the Contras.
   Ortega said the Sandinista victory would make the United States
respect Nicaragua after a decade of hostility. The U.S. Congress
cut off military aid to the rebels in February 1988 but kept up
non-lethal aid to put pressure on the Sandinistas to hold free
elections.
   ``We want the peace of the man who is respected,'' Ortega said.
``And that is what we always have demanded from the North American
government _ respect.''
   The Sandinistas put on a lively show, with dance troupes, rock
singers, fireworks and bands.
   Nearly everyone in the crowd had a Sandinista campaign memento _
T-shirts in bright colors with ``Daniel Presidente'' or pictures of
other candidates; baseball caps, keychains, belt buckles or
headbands.
   Ortega claimed a crowd of 500,000, but experienced observers
estimated it at about 300,000 _ still almost five times what Mrs.
Chamorro drew at her closing rally Sunday.
   Despite a huge campaign effort and opinion polls that generally
give Ortega the lead, uncertainty about the outcome lingered.
   Many Nicaraguans are reluctant to speak their minds to strangers
and the large Sandinista rallies appeared padded by public
employees and others pressured to attend.
   In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday that
Nicaraguan authorities have been routinely threatening opposition
party activists as part of a campaign to influence the elections.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that opposition
sympathizers have told the U.S. Embassy in Managua that government
security agents have threatened them with ``loss of job or land,
bodily harm or even death.''
   Mrs. Tutwiler said supporters of Mrs. Chamorro in the military
have had their voter registration cards confiscated and opposition
poll watchers ``have been threatened not to show up on election
day.''

   The Senate Judiciary Committee appears set to
approve the nomination of conservative civil rights official
Clarence Thomas to become a federal appeals judge, despite sharp
last-minute criticism from a member of the panel.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, circulated a letter among
Judiciary Committee members on Tuesday, declaring that he was
unsatisfied with answers provided by Thomas to the committee last
week.
   As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
Thomas has been one of the most visible blacks in the Reagan and
Bush administrations. And his opposition to affirmative action
programs and quotas along with his other conservative views have
drawn sharp criticism from civil rights forces.
   At his confirmation hearing last week, Thomas said state and
local agencies were primarily to blame for the lapse without action
of more than 900 cases of alleged job discrimination in recent
years.
   Critics from women's and senior citizens groups said at the time
that the number of lapsed cases actually ran into the thousands.
And Metzenbaum said in his letter Tuesday that the responsibility
rested with the commission itself.
   Metzenbaum said he was not opposing Thomas because of the
chairman's political beliefs but because of his remarks on the law
at the hearing.
   As the committee vote approached, however, civil rights forces
appeared resigned to Senate approval of Thomas.
   Some of the steam went out of the drive to block confirmation
when Benjamin Hooks, head of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, announced a day before the hearing
that he would not stand in the way of placing Thomas on the court.
   If confirmed he would take the place of Robert Bork on the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, often described as
the nation's second highest court. Because it is located in the
nation's capital it frequently is called on to decide major
governmental cases and it has often been a springboard to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Bork resigned after being rejected by the Senate for elevation
to the Supreme Court in the most bitter judicial fight of recent
years.
   Thomas, born in poverty in rural Georgia, is a graduate of Yale
Law School and his career has been aided by close ties to Sen. John
C. Danforth, R-Mo.
   He worked for Danforth both in his Senate office and when
Danforth was attorney general of the State of Missouri.
   Thomas was recommended to the panel at his confirmation hearing
by Danforth and by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Charles Robb, D-Va.

   The excitement backstage _ even among the
older folks _ showed the six-inch Grammy trophy was something more
than just another piece for the mantel.
   ``If you stick around long enough, you get your just desserts,''
said Don Henley, 42, one of several older rockers who shone at
Wednesday night's 32nd annual Grammy Awards.
   ``I thought you'd only get this at 75,'' said former Beatle Paul
McCartney, winner of the lifetime achievement award. ``But in this
business they're getting younger and younger. I think Debbie Gibson
is getting one next year.''
   After taking their trophies on the stage of the Shrine
Auditorium, some of the victorious musicians swept through the
cavernous backstage area to answer an onslaught of questions from
reporters gathered at five different media stages, divided by blue
curtains.
   Bonnie Raitt, the big winner with four Grammys, was ecstatic.
   ``I feel like the guy that just beat Mike Tyson,'' said Raitt,
whose awards included best female rock vocal performance and best
album for her ``Nick of Time'' LP.
   Miss Raitt, known for her mixture of blues, ballads and rock,
said she finally feels she is getting recognition since her album
recording debut in 1971.
   ``The critics and peers said finally she made a great record,''
Raitt said, shaking one of her statues.
   The 40-year-old Raitt said she applauded the nominations this
year of many veteran rockers, such as the ``Rolling Stones,'' and
``Traveling Wilburys.''
   ``A lot of people over 40 got nominated, so I guess we haven't
been put out to pasture,'' Raitt said.
   Some of the musicians were asked what they might have become if
not for their musical careers.
   The Texas-born Henley, sporting a gray suit, bolo tie and black
boots, said he would have been a rancher.
   Henley was nominated four times and won for male rock vocal
performance for his ``End of the Innocence'' album.
   Actress and singer Bette Midler stoutly said she wouldn't have
any career if not for music.
   ``I like to sing more than anything, it's transporting,'' Midler
said. ``I feel at my most creative, when I'm singing.''
   Midler and producer Arif Mardin captured the song of the year
for ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' a ballad featured in Midler's movie
``Beaches.''
   Rap singer Young M.C., who graduated from the University of
Southern California last year with an economics degree, said
accounting would be his profession, if not for music.
   Young M.C. garnered an award for his ``Bust A Move,'' rap song,
and said the music industry is gradually realizing the significance
of rap music.
   ``You've got to crawl, before you walk,'' said the rapper.
   Anita Baker said she was amazed at her triumph in the heavily
competitive rhythm and blues female performance.
   ``Janet deserves it more than me,'' said Baker, who won for her
ballad, ``Giving You the Best that I Got,'' which was pitted
against Janet Jackson's ``Miss You Much,'' and Aretha Franklin's
``Through the Storm.''

<HEAD>Mazowiecki Says Germanys Should Guarantee Western Border Before
Uniting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before the two Germanys unite they owe it
to Poland to agree to a ``peace treaty'' guaranteeing this
country's western border, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
insisted.
   At a rare news conference Wednesday, Mazowiecki also reiterated
the Polish position that Soviet troops should remain in their
country as insurance.
   ``We believe that a new stage of history created by the
reunification of Germany ... must not be entered with any ambiguity
concerning Poland's western border,'' he said, emphasizing his
demand that decisions affecting Poland's security not be made
without its participation.
   ``We are demanding that before the reunification, the total
removal of these ambiguities must take place.''
   Mazowiecki proposed that after East German elections in March,
the two Germanys and Poland initial a treaty, ``corresponding with
a peace treaty,'' recognizing the post-World War II borders, and
that it be signed finally by the government of a unified Germany.
   He said such an agreement could be negotiated, with Poland's
participation, at the reunification talks planned by the two
Germanys and the four victorious World War II Allies: the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   A third of present-day Poland was territory forfeited by Germany
after World War II, compensating for an even larger eastern Polish
territory annexed by the Soviet Union.
   East Germany and West Germany have individually signed
agreements recognizing the Poland's western border. But West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, some of whose political supporters still
consider the lands part of Germany, has said he cannot make
promises about the border on behalf of a unified Germany.
   Mazowiecki has demanded a seat at the six-party unification
talks when the security of Germany's neighbors is discussed, and he
said Wednesday that Poland's ambassadors are delivering letters to
the four Allies outlining its position.
   ``It is unthinkable in today's democratic world to have this
form of Yalta when one group of countries could decide about
another,'' he said, referring to the 1945 conference when the
Allied leaders reworked Poland's borders and ceded Eastern Europe
to Soviet hegemony.
   West Germany has rejected a role for Poland at the talks, saying
the unification proposal concerns only the territory of the two
Germanys.
   The United States also has indicated opposition, but Mazowiecki
said he would not consider the position final.
   East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has expressed ``full
understanding'' for Poland's position and his foreign minister,
Oskar Fischer, said Wednesday that a united Germany must give full
legal recognition to Poland's western border. Fischer also warned
of rapid unification, adding his voice to those of other Warsaw
Pact officials who say the process is moving too quickly.
   There have been expressions of support from Great Britian,
Mazowiecki said, while France has not made an official statement.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in an interview
published Wednesday that a united Germany must guarantee the
postwar borders of Poland, which Nazi Germany invaded in 1939 to
touch off World War II.
   Unlike Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Poland has not pushed for the
removal of Soviet troops. Mazowiecki's Solidarity-dominated
government has said the Soviet troops should remain as insurance
against Germany.
   Mazowiecki said he is aware that the public favors the
withdrawal of Soviet troops, ``but we assess this situation
realistically, in the perspective of the Germany problem, and thus
at the moment do not put this issue in such a category.''

<HEAD>FBI Won't Have to Cut 400 Agents, Justice Department Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says the FBI won't have
to cut 400 agents from its payroll next year because it has found
new ways to save money under President Bush's proposed budget for
fiscal 1991.
   The cost-cutting measures were worked out in the last few weeks
since Bush's budget proposal was sent to Congress, Justice
spokesman David Runkel said Wednesday.
   The proposed budget would have forced the FBI to cut more than
400 agents from its workforce of more than 10,000, probably through
attrition, to finance an estimated $42 million in additional
overtime expenses.
   A new law passed by Congress last year increases the overtime
pay for federal law enforcement officers, including FBI agents.
   Under the new plan to pay for the overtime costs, the FBI will
stagger the hiring of 338 new agents provided in the 1991 budget to
investigate organized crime, drugs and white-collar fraud, said an
FBI official.
   Their hiring will be spread out over the 1991 fiscal year to
save money, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The FBI also will postpone the purchase of some new equipment, the
official said.

<HEAD>Cavazos Sticks With Troubled Loan Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos says he
will continue supporting federally guaranteed loans for students in
private vocational and technical schools even though their default
rate is 37 percent.
   ``I want to make it clear that in no way does the Secretary of
Education advocate stepping away from support of guaranteed student
loan programs for proprietary schools,'' Cavazos told a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday.
   However, Cavazos said the administration was determined to crack
down on institutions with high rates of default.
   Proprietary schools are privately owned institutions that teach
trades such as electronics or auto repair.
   Overall, counting loans for regular college attendance, there
were 1.9 million defaults in the guaranteed student loan program in
1989, and the projected number this year is 2 million.
   Cavazos was testifying on President Bush's educational budget
request of $25 billion, up more than $500 million from the 1990
budget. He noted the federal contribution is about 6 percent of the
nation's total expenditure of $353 billion for the current school
year.

<HEAD>Official Says Nuclear Arms Plant to Remain Idle Until Summer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Flats weapons plant in Colorado,
closed indefinitely late last year for safety and management
improvements, is unlikely to resume full production until at least
July, a senior Energy Department official says.
   The plant, situated about 16 miles northwest of Denver, is the
sole supplier of plutonium triggers for U.S. nuclear warheads,
which are vital to maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile.
   Neither the Energy Department nor the Pentagon has said how long
Rocky Flats could remain out of service before the arms stockpile
would be jeopardized.
   The plant also was closed for a few months in 1988 after a
worker was contaminated by radioactivity.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had said shortly after the
latest shutdown that he hoped Rocky Flats would resume production
by February, but the contractor that runs the facility says it
needs more time to install new safety procedures and retrain
workers.
   Adm. J.M. Barr, the deputy assistant energy secretary for
military application, said Wednesday that one of the key plutonium
processing facilities could be ready to resume operation by the end
of June.
   Barr said current plans called for the full resumption of Rocky
Flats production sometime between July and September, although that
was subject to revision.
   Barr told the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety,
which is monitoring progress toward resuming operations, that he
would have a more specific target date ``very early in April.''
   Barr stressed that the final decision to resume production
rested with Watkins, who in recent weeks has pledged to subject the
plant overhaul to a full review by independent observers.
   Rocky Flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and
waste-handling problems in recent years.

<HEAD>High School Graduate Objects to Heavy Metal Song</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HASKELL, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The selection of a heavy metal rock song
for graduation ceremonies at a high school has created a dilemna
for the student council president.
   Instead of Edward Elgar's ``Pomp and Circumstance,'' seniors at
Harmony Grove High School picked ``I Remember You'' by Skid Row for
their traditional exit walk after the awarding of diplomas.
   The council president, 17-year-old Jennifer Miller, said this
week that her Baptist beliefs ``don't allow me to listen to that
type of music.''
   Her mother, Janet Miller, said Jennifer has never been allowed
to listen to heavy metal music because of what she called its drug
messages and anti-religion overtones.
   Ms. Miller said the song and group were inappropriate for the
spring graduation. ``I believe the reputations of groups like Skid
Row suggests their own nature.''
   ``I support her 100 percent,'' Mrs. Miller said.
   Superintendent Dan Henley and high school principal Billy Gibbs
reviewed the song, and declined to intervene.
   ``If the song had contained any reference to drugs or anything
that could be considered immoral, we would have rejected it,''
Henley said.
   Ms. Miller said she wanted to attend the ceremony, but would not
walk in the seniors walk.
   ``I have the right to have my diploma handed to me during the
ceremony and not sent to me through the mail,'' she said.
   But Henley disagreed.
   If Ms. Miller refuses to take part in the senior walk, he said,
she will not be permitted to receive the diploma on stage and it
will be mailed to her.
   Gibbs said parents of other students in this town 25 miles
southwest of Little Rock would be embarassed if Ms. Miller left
early or stayed seated during the song.
   ``It would look like a visible protest,'' he said. ``Parents
should not be put through that.''
   Henley said Ms. Miller could appeal his decision to the district
school board.

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's two largest cocaine-growing
countries have rejected a U.S. idea to put coca-chewing
caterpillars in their fields, saying the insects might also ravage
other crops.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department is studying the potential for
using such insects to kill coca plants in Bolivia and Peru.
   President Bush has asked for $6.5 million for the program
involving the Malumbia moth, whose larvae eat coca leaves. The moth
is native to Peru's Huallaga Valley, where more coca grows than
anywhere else in the world.
   But Bolivian and Peruvian officials said Wednesday that
Washington should instead spend its time and money helping their
farmers switch from coca to other crops.
   ``The worm is not needed here,'' said Carlos Guillen, a Peruvian
government spokesman in Lima. ``What the government wants is to
replace the coca crop with other crops, such as coffee, cacao (and)
palm oil trees.''
   ``Many studies have been made in Peru concerning this worm as a
means of eradicating the coca crop,'' Guillen said, and the
government views crop substitution as a better solution than
eradication.
   He said use of the worms could endanger citrus trees and other
crops.
   Osvaldo Antezana of Bolivia's Interior Department said
Wednesday: ``The government rejects any such ideas because the plan
presented in the Cartagena drug summit ... calls for alternative
development that would take place with the participation of
farmers.''
   Bolivian farmers supported their government's position.
   ``By using bugs, the Americans would be confirming that they do
not have any political will to solve the social and economic
problems in Bolivia,'' said Segundino Montevilla of the
Confederation of Bolivian Peasants. ``If it is true, this would
mean that the famous Cartagena drug summit made no sense.''
   Antezana, the undersecretary for alternative development, said
Bolivia's policies ``are clear and concrete. They are based on the
voluntary reduction of coca plants with economic compensation ...
without the use of chemical products or biological agents.''
   Mauro Bertero, the agriculture minister, said: ``I do not
believe the United States would attempt something like this without
the approval of the government of Bolivia. That would not fit in
with the dialogue and agreements reached at Cartagena.''
   At the summit a week ago between Bush and the leaders of
Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, U.S. officials agreed to provide aid
in developing other crops. Peru produces most of the world's coca,
which is processed into cocaine, and Bolivia grows about one-third
of it.
   The Agriculture Department research program was reported Tuesday
by The Washington Post, and White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said later: ``We are not undertaking any biological war.
Neither troops nor caterpillars will go in without prior request
and consultation.''
   More than 300,000 farmers in Bolivia and 200,000 in Peru depend
on coca for their livelihood. Peru estimates sales of the leaves
bring $1 billion into the country each year, and Bolivia earns up
to $500 million a year from coca.
   Bolivian farmers have destroyed 4,940 acres of coca plants since
Jan. 1 in return for payments of about $800 per acre.
   Antezana said the voluntary eradication program had gotten
bigger since December because of a sharp drop in coca prices
resulting from Colombia's crackdown on cocaine traffickers and
increased interdiction within Bolivia.

<HEAD>Global Warming Linked to Carbon Dioxide in Atmosphere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A worldwide warming over the past 30 years is
almost certainly related to increases in carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, according to a statistical study published today.
   Detailed analysis found that there is only about two chances in
a million that the two trends are not linked, researchers said.
   But that does not prove that the carbon dioxide was triggering
the global warming, they said.
   Many scientists are concerned that continued buildup of carbon
dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere may lead to global
warming that could alter climates through an atmospheric process
called the greenhouse effect.
   But researchers disagree over whether gas buildup has caused any
detectable warming yet.
   The statistical analysis is presented in today's issue of the
British journal Nature by Cynthia Kuo, Craig Lindberg and David
Thomson of AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J.
   Their work used observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations taken monthly since March 1958 at the summit of
Mauna Loa in Hawaii. The values are typical of measurements made at
several sites, the researchers said.
   They compared the concentrations to monthly averages of global
temperature from 1958 to 1988 and found a strong statistical
relationship between short-term fluctuations in the two trends.
   That means ``there is probably some physical link'' between the
two trends but ``there's no way to say which is causing which,''
Lindberg said in a recent interview.
   Some third factor, such as increased energy output from the sun,
may be causing both observed trends, he said.
   The analysis found that changes in carbon dioxide concentrations
lagged behind those in temperature by five months. That might occur
if warmer temperatures cause carbon dioxide to emerge from oceans
or elsewhere in the environment, Lindberg and Thomson said in
telephone interviews.
   In a Nature editorial, researcher T.P. Barnett of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., also said that the
study's limitations mean it cannot be taken as proof of warming due
to carbon dioxide.

<HEAD>Four U.S. Lawmakers Denied Permission to Observe Lithuania
Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four U.S. congressmen have been denied
permission to travel to the independence-minded Soviet republic of
Lithuania for this weekend's elections, the legislators said.
   The lawmakers had hoped to pick up visas at the Soviet consulate
in East Berlin but the Soviets sent them a cable ``advising us that
we would not be allowed to witness the Lithuanian elections,'' Rep.
Richard Durbin said Wednesday.
   The Illinois Democrat and three colleagues were selected by
Congress to observe the local elections Saturday after an
invitation was received from the Lithuanian national movement
Sajudis.
   ``It's very frustrating. We're running into the limits of
glasnost, apparently,'' said John Miller, R-Wash. The members of
the party were Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.; and Bill Sarpalius,
D-Texas.
   Lithuania and the other Soviet Baltic republics _ Latvia and
Estonia _ want more freedom from Moscow, and the elections will
test the strength of nationalists in Lithuania.
   In December, Lithuania's Communist Party became the first
regional party in the country to break with Moscow and declare
itself independent. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev later
visited the republic in an attempt to dissuade the secessionits but
met with little success.
   Durbin was asked if the Soviets had specified reasons for the
visa denial.
   He said they were told they hadn't gone through the appropriate
procedures.
   ``But frankly that conflicts with the fact that other
parliamentarians from Canada and Austria are presently in
Lithuania. It appears that they have made some special ruling, as
(the denial) relates only to members of Congress from the United
States.''
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said the
congressmen had not been invited by any officially recognized
groups and said their trip was not coordinated or discussed through
diplomatic channels.
   ``Taking all these facts into account, the congressmen were
informed that their trip to the U.S.S.R. at present would be
incorrect,'' he said.
   ``This decision of course is in no connection with the
personalities of the congressmen. They are welcome in the U.S.S.R.
at any convenient date which could be mutually agreed upon.''
   Durbin said the delegation would continue to press for
permission to go to Lithuania and would contact Washington ``to
rally some support'' to pressure the Soviets.
   ``We still have time to make it to Lithuania before the
election,'' Durbin said.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent states between
World War I and 1940, when they were annexed by the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Galaxies Clumped in Regular Pattern on Vast Scale, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers said today they had found clumps of
galaxies occurring in an apparently regular pattern over a vast
distance, a finding that clashes with current understanding of the
universe.
   It was surprising enough to find clumps of galaxies rather than
a more uniform distribution over such a large scale, but ``to find
the regularity is just mind-boggling,'' said study co-author David
Koo.
   Gravity would not have enough time since the birth of the
universe to produce the pattern over such a huge scale, so the find
may be a ``fossil imprint'' from the very early universe, he said.
   But another scientist familiar with the study said he believes
the findings are merely a statistical fluke, rather than a real
pattern.
   ``This is so counter to our other notions (about the universe)
that I'm going to treat it skeptically unless it's really proven
conclusively,'' said Marc Davis of the University of California,
Berkeley.
   The new work is presented in today's issue of the British
journal Nature by Koo of the University of California, Santa Cruz,
Alexander Szalay of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and
researchers in England.
   They surveyed galaxies in two opposite directions from the Milky
Way galaxy, which includes Earth.
   Within these narrow lines of sight, researchers found about a
dozen clumps of galaxies separated by approximately evenly spaced
gaps of 400 million to 800 million light-years, Koo said Wednesday.
A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.88
trillion miles.
   The calculated distance between clumps depends on one's
assumptions about how fast the universe is expanding.
   The gaps were not completely empty of galaxies. The Milky Way,
for example, resides between two clumps in about the middle of the
overall series the researchers observed, Koo said.
   Koo said researchers are now looking elsewhere to see if the
regularity shows up again. If the pattern is proven, it would force
a revamping or abandonment of currently popular theories about the
development of the universe, he said.
   Davis agreed that the proven existence of such a pattern would
require a ``fundamental rethinking'' of theories about the very
early universe. ``It is totally outside the domain of any physics
we have thought of,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound In Tokyo, Dollar Inches Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fluctuated
wildly today but ended up rebounding moderately from its plunge of
more than 3 percent the previous day, while the dollar inched up
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell 1,161.19 points
Wednesday in its third biggest single-day decline, gained back
92.51 points, or 0.25 percent, on Thursday, closing at 35,826.84.
   The index rose more than 400 points in today's early trading,
but then plunged on a wave of computer-guided selling by foreign
institutions seeking to capitalize on price differences between
shares for immediate delivery and those for future delivery.
   At the end of the morning session, it was 405.97 points below
the previous day's close. But it recovered as investors, who had
been waiting uncertainly on the sidelines, gradually returned to
the market in the afternoon.
   Mike Morizumi, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said these
investors thought the market had hit bottom when the index fell to
35,000.
   But he said a real upward push for stock prices was unlikely
before the central bank acts on its official discount rate, the
interest charged for loans to commercial banks.
   The market has been speculating on a discount rate increase
following last Sunday's parliamentary elections. Higher interest
rates tend to discourage stock investment, and dealers said
investors hesitated to make major purchases now.
   Central bank officials have said they still are watching
economic conditions.
   Dealers and analysts said a wave of computer-guided selling by
foreign institutional investors has been a major causes of the
Nikkei index's recent decline.
   ``Because only a small volume of shares is being traded, such
massive selling by computer can easily send the entire market
falling,'' said Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody Securities.
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated at
550 million shares, up from 450 million Wednesday.
   In the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 145.23 yen,
up 0.08 yen from Wednesday's close of 145.15 yen. It opened at
145.45 yen and ranged between 145.15 yen and 145.48 yen.
   In the last three days, the dollar has edged up a total of 0.71
yen.
   ``Market players cannot figure out the market direction, and
they are just taking a wait-and-see stance so far,'' said Akiko
Kobayashi, a Bank of Tokyo trader.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Law Allowing Old Rail Lines To Be Used as
Paths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURA GRIFFIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court may have paved the
way for thousands of miles of hiking and biking paths by rejecting
a couple's appeal of a law allowing unused railway lines to be
converted into nature trails.
   The justices Wednesday unanimously rejected an appeal by J. Paul
Preseault and his wife, Patricia, who said a 1983 federal law known
as the ``rails-to-trails'' act trampled their property rights to
satisfy the nation's back-to-nature and physical-fitness boom.
   ``I guess at this point I'm stunned,'' J. Paul Preseault said.
``I didn't do this, go all the way to the Supreme Court, to have
them tell me to file my case in another court. I wasn't looking for
money. I wanted my property rights honored.''
   The ruling could affect a large number of property owners. The
nation's railway system, at its peak in 1920 with 272,000 miles of
track, is now down to 141,000 miles and 3,000 more miles are
abandoned each year.
   Justice William J. Brennan said the rails-to-trails law is a
legitimate exercise of congressional power aimed at ``encouraging
the development of additional recreational trails.''
   But Preseault said the public recreation path that runs through
his lakefront property in Burlington violates the U.S.
Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which bars the taking of private
property without just compensation, and also said it interferes
unlawfully with interstate commerce.
   Brennan said Preseault still can file a claim for compensation
against the federal government under a separate law.
   Preseault said Wednesday he intends to fight for compensation.
   ``The opinion is a strong reaffirmation of the requirement that
government can be asked for compensation,'' said Presault's
attorney, Michael Berger of Los Angeles. ``The Supreme Court is
saying the federal claims court is there for compensation for this
kind of taking of property.''
   Ownership of the land claimed by the Preseaults is in dispute.
Vermont officials say the property belongs to the state.
   But if the Preseaults own the property, they say they have a
right under Vermont law to use the land once the rail line is
abandoned.
   The 1983 federal law _ an amended version of the earlier
National Trails System Act _ allows for railroad rights-of-way to
be maintained for possible future railroad use while the land is
converted at least temporarily to nature trails.
   This practice, known as rail banking, is at the heart of
Wednesday's ruling.
   Vermont entered into a lease with the city of Burlington that
allows the city to maintain the right-of-way as a trail while
preserving it for possible rail use.
   The Preseaults said the rail-banking provisions are a sham to
conceal the true purpose of the federal law _ preventing railroad
rights-of-way from being returned to their rightful owners after
abandonment.
   The couple said the rail-banking procedure disguises the fact
that the rail lines have been abandoned.
   Brennan rejected that argument.
   The law is not invalid ``merely because more Draconian measures
_ such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of
all abandonments _ might advance more completely the rail-banking
purpose,'' he said. ``The history of congressional attempts to
address the problem of rail abandonments provides sufficient reason
to defer'' to Congress, he added.

<HEAD>Michigan, South Carolina Legislatures Approve Teen Abortion Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislatures in South Carolina and Michigan gave their final
approval to bills requiring parental consent for teen-agers seeking
abortions.
   The bill passed Wednesday by the South Carolina House requires
consent by a parent or other guardian for girls under 17. A
spokesman said Gov. Carroll Campbell backed the bill but wanted to
``read the fine print'' before signing it.
   In Michigan, Gov. James Blanchard said he would veto the bill,
which passed the House by a 65-42 vote. The bill's supporters
acknowleged they lacked the necessary 74 votes for an override in
the 110-member House.
   The bill earlier had passed in the Michigan Senate.
   Barbara Listing, president of Right to Life of Michigan, said
backers of the bill will try to mount a petition drive to put the
issue on a statewide ballot. The group used that approach when it
successfully sought to ban state-funded abortions for poor women.
   ``We're pleased, the parents will be pleased. It will be the
abortion clinics that won't be pleased because it will cut into
their business,'' Listing said.
   But abortion rights advocates interpreted the vote's margin as a
victory for their movement.
   ``We won. It's over. They lost,'' said Rep. Maxine Berman, a
Democrat. ``What this bill is all about is intimidating women into
motherhood.''
   Blanchard said the abortion consent bill is unreasonable.
   ``I would veto it for a lot of reasons, first of which is it
would deny any help to women victimized by sex crimes, rape and
incest, other abuse,'' Blanchard said. ``I think that's
unreasonable.''
   The bill would allow pregnant girls under 18 who felt they
couldn't approach one of their parents about an abortion, or were
denied permission, to seek a waiver from a judge.
   The South Carolina bill requires girls under 17 to get the
permission of a parent, grandparent, guardian or judge before
obtaining an abortion. It offers no exception for girls who have
been raped.
   Parents who deny their daughter's request for an abortion would
have to share legal and financial responsibility for their
daughter's offspring until their daughter reaches the age of 18.
   The South Carolina Senate already approved the bill.
   ``The governor endorses the concept of parental consent but
wants to read the fine print'' before he signs the bill into law,
said Tucker Eskew, Campbell's spokesman.
   Rep. Wes Hayes, the bill's sponsor, hailed the passage and
termed the measure ``pro-family legislation.''
   ``It says that we want to have somebody else involved in the
decision process other than just that 16-year-old and the abortion
clinic,'' said Hayes, a Democrat.
   South Carolina law now requires a girl under 16 to obtain a
parent's consent for an abortion, but the law has not been enforced.

<TEXT>
   China today strongly protested a U.S. State
Department report that accuses it of widespread human rights
abuses, insisting the report's contents are based on lies and
hearsay.
   However, a Foreign Ministry spokesman refused to say if his
government planned to retaliate in any way. Past responses to
foreign criticism often have contained warnings that relations
would be damaged.
   ``The Chinese government and people express their utmost
indignation at this (report), which violates the basic norms
governing international relations,'' said the spokesman, Li
Zhaoxing, reading a prepared statement at the ministry's weekly
news conference.
   ``The Foreign Ministry ... hereby lodges a strong protest with
the U.S. Government,'' Li said.
   The State Department report, issued Wednesday, contained
Washington's strongest public criticism ever of China under senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, a man whom three American presidents have
toasted as a friend.
   Its comprehensive listing of abuses, from torture and secret
executions to pervasive surveillance of daily life, was expected to
halt the slight warming of U.S.-Chinese relations that followed the
December visit of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
predicted that official Chinese contacts with the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing would drop off sharply.
   The embassy experienced similarly chilly relations with many
Chinese government units in the first months after the army's June
3-4 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   Official newspapers then carried daily attacks on the United
States for criticizing the army's killing of hundreds of
protesters, and for sheltering dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife.
   However, relations began improving in the last months of 1989,
following visits of former President Richard Nixon and Scowcroft.
   The official response to the State Department report said the
report was based on ``guesses and rumors''.
   ``The repeated acts of grossly interfering in China's internal
affairs ... are but expressions of out-and-out hegemonism and power
politics,'' it said.
   It also accused the United States of failing to solve its own
``extremely serious human rights problems'' and of violating the
rights of Panamanians when it invaded their country in December to
oust Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Asked to give examples of material in the report that is based
on rumor or lies, Li told journalists to read the Chinese press for
the truth, and added, ``You might also find answers to your
question by resorting to what we in China call a self-examination.''
   Li refused to say how many people are being held without trial
in connection with the protests. Thousands were arrested in Beijing
alone after the crackdown began, and many have not yet been
formally charged.
   The State Department report criticized Chinese judicial
procedure and called prison conditions ``invariably harsh and
frequently degrading.''
   It noted an official Chinese report last year said about 2
million Chinese were sent to labor camps in the past decade.
   It also noted close monitoring and control of personal life in
China, including surveillance by neighborhood watch committees,
opening of mail, tapping of telephones and stationing of cameras on
roads and in buildings.

   Rain soaked the nation today from Oklahoma City to the
mid-Atlantic and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. Up to
4 inches were expected by tonight along an area 100 miles inland
from the Gulf stretching from Texas to Florida's panhandle.
   Flood watches continued in Mississippi, Alabama, northern
Georgia, northwestern Florida and Louisiana, dampening New Orleans'
pre-Mardi Gras festivities.
   Thunderstorms moved east from Texas into the lower Mississippi
Valley after leaving locally heavy rain including 4.01 inches at
Rosenberg, 2.80 inches at Fulsher and 2.50 inches at Satsuma.
   In the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas, area, 2.18 inches fell
between 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. EST Wednesday.
   The rain canceled or postponed some of the parades preceding
Tuesday's Mardi Gras celebration.
   Heavy rain and snow disappeared from the fog-shrouded Pacific
Northwest today.
   The Northeast Seaboard looked for low pressure and rain by
tonight, some arctic air on Friday and frigid temperatures and a
chance of snow by the weekend.
   Flood watches for tonight were posted in southern Vermont, where
falling temperatures were changing rain to snow.
   Northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula looked for
flurries off Lake Superior today.
   High winds buffeted Alaska and calmed Hawaii. Temperatures of 28
below and gusts to 30 mph spawned wind chills of minus 75 and
colder near Bethel, Alaska. Today's high should be 18 degrees
below, with a wind chill of nearly 70 below. The mercury was
expected to dive tonight, perhaps to record lows.
   Chandalar, Alaska, recorded the nation's low of minus 56
Wednesday. Caribou, Maine, was the cold spot in the lower 48 with a
reading of 14 below.
   Gale-force winds abated on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa today as a
Pacific low-pressure system churned northeast toward the mainland.
   On Wednesday, the Upper Peninsula towns of Sault Ste. Marie and
Marquette, Mich., enjoyed record highs for the date with readings
of 42 and 46 degrees, respectively.
   Wednesday's high temperature for the nation was 88 degrees at
Fort Myers and Naples, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Veteran performer Bonnie Raitt bounced back
from a tough decade including a battle against drugs and alcohol
and switch of record labels with a high-powered comeback capped by
four Grammys.
   The Grammys were the 40-year-old, rebellious redhead's first in
a career spanning 20 years.
   Her ``Nick of Time'' LP, expressing doubts about love and
growing older, won Miss Raitt album of the year and female rock
vocal trophies Wednesday. The single ``Nick of Time'' won for
female pop vocal performance.
   Miss Raitt, whose influences include country and blues, also
shared the best traditional blues performance Grammy with John Lee
Hooker for their ``I'm In The Mood'' track on Hooker's ``The
Healer'' album.
   ``I can only take so much of this. Wake me up when this is
over,'' said Miss Raitt, whose previous album, ``Nine Lives,'' was
ignored by both critics and her record label, which refused to
release it on compact disc.
   The daughter of Broadway musical star John Raitt (``Carousel''
and ``Oklahoma'') and piano accompanist Marjorie Haydock, Miss
Raitt taught herself guitar at age 9.
   Her early influences included blues master Junior Wells, who
contributed to Miss Raitt's first album, ``Bonnie Raitt,'' in 1971.
``Nick of Time'' is her ninth album.
   One of her best known singles was Miss Raitt's 1977 cover of the
late Del Shannon's ``Runaway.'' But in the interim, her work has
been uneven as she fought drug and alcohol abuse.
   Three years ago, she began psychotherapy and a year later she
joined Alcoholics Anonymous.
   The singer said during her recent concert tour, which played to
packed houses across the nation, that vanity led to her rebirth as
an artist.
   ``I was going to make an album with Prince,'' she said in 1988.
``It's one thing to go on stage if you're a little chunky, it's
another to make a video with a guy who's known for looking foxy. I
decided to lose weight, which you can't do if you're drinking all
the time.''

   Paul McCartney, honored with a lifetime
achievement Grammy, said he had a little help from his friends.
   ``I've got to take this opportunity now that I've got this award
here to thank John, George and Ringo for being beautiful people,''
McCartney said Wednesday at the 32nd annual Grammy Awards.
   McCartney, a five-time Grammy award winner who recorded hits
with the Beatles, Wings and as a solo artist, was hailed by actress
Meryl Streep for his ``anthems of the spirit'' and honored by Ray
Charles and Stevie Wonder, who performed Beatles songs.
   McCartney in turn paid tribute to those artists who influenced
him.
   ``When I was just child in Liverpool, I was listening to the
radio and this record came on called `What'd I Say,' by a guy named
Ray Charles. ... A little later there was this guy called little
Stevie Wonder and a record called, `Fingertips.' And it had the
same effect on me,'' McCartney said.
   Backstage, McCartney expressed amazement at getting the lifetime
achievement award at age 47.
   ``I thought you'd only get this at 75,'' McCartney said. ``But
in this business they're getting younger and younger. I think
Debbie Gibson is getting one next year.''

<HEAD>Sheriff's Office Says No Laws Violated When Asthmatic Student's
Mouth Taped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sheriff's office said no laws were
violated when a teacher taped shut the mouth of an asthmatic
fifth-grader for talking in class.
   But the school district placed Kenneth Roberts, 20, on
administrative leave and started its own investigation into the
episode.
   ``I will delay any judgment about Mr. Roberts until the facts
are in,'' said Adams County schools superintendent Michael
Massarotti. ``Regardless of whether the child had been asthmatic or
not, we would have taken the same course of action.''
   Roberts said he put tape over the Berkeley Gardens Elementary
School student's mouth after the boy yelled across the room and
ignored his requests to quiet down. He said the boy was not hurt,
and he learned the student had a history of asthma only after the
incident.
   The sheriff's office began investigating last Thursday after
principal Kathleen Bassett reported the student's mouth was shut
with masking tape for about 20 minutes.
   ``This matter was investigated by detectives ... it was
determined there was no violation of criminal law,'' said Robert
Neiman, a sheriff's office spokesman.
   The boy's name was not released. His mother, Sherrie Rivera,
said she was ``real disappointed'' with Roberts. ``We've discussed
his talking problems, and the teacher has been patient. We just
wish he hadn't gone this far.''
   She said the boy's asthma requires constant medication. ``We
always carry an inhaler with him. ... This could have been really
bad.''

<HEAD>Children's Programming Draws Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The happy land of kids' TV has turned nasty
with an antitrust suit brought by the Walt Disney Co. against the
Fox Broadcasting Co. and its affiliates over Fox's planned
children's programming.
   Disney alleged in the suit filed in U.S. District Court
Wednesday that Fox has attempted to prevent its 129 affiliated
stations from carrying ``The Disney Afternoon,'' a two-hour daily
lineup of children's programming in syndication.
   Fox soon will introduce its own children's network of daily
shows, with the first program set to debut in September. Both
Disney and Fox are selling their children's shows on condition that
they be broadcast from 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.
   The suit seeks unspecified compensatory damages, punitive
damages and a permanent injunction.
   Disney claimed in the suit that Fox has intimidated its
affiliate stations with threats that the stations will be dropped
by Fox if they take the Disney lineup.
   ``American kids have voted through their viewing habits and have
consistently and unarguably determined that Disney animated
programming is their No. 1 choice for afternoon viewing,'' Richard
Frank, president of the Disney studio, said in a statement.
   ``Having lost this battle, Fox now wants to deprive children of
these shows by coercing its affiliates to buy Fox's programming
rather than Disney's,'' Frank said.
   But Kevin O'Brien, president of the oversight committee for the
Fox Children's Network, said that the Disney suit ``reeks of
absurdity and it's nothing more than a scare tactic.''
   He said that Fox has made it ``repeatedly clear'' that Fox would
allow its stations the ``flexibility'' they need to show Disney's
kids' lineup.
   The Fox children's lineup starts with a daily half hour and
three hours each Saturday this September. Additional half hours to
the daily schedule are set to be added later.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered all proceedings sealed in
relation to a man under investigation in the recent mail bombings
that killed a judge and a civil rights lawyer.
   Attorneys for Walter LeRoy Moody had asked U.S. District Judge
Richard C. Freeman to issue a gag order, seal all documents in the
case and order the return of items confiscated from searches of
Moody's home, storage area and vehicles.
   Freeman said Wednesday the public's interest in seeing the
arrest of the person or persons responsible for the mid-December
bombings outweighed interest in day-to-day developments.
   Peter Canfield and Terry Adamson, attorneys representing The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV, said they planned to file
an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today.
   Adamson said the appeals court could overturn Freeman's entire
ruling or find that portions of the proceedings could be released
to the press _ just as portions of the videotaped testimony of
former President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-contra case were
released this week.
   Moody's attorneys, Michael Hauptman and Bruce Harvey, said they
could not comment on any aspect of the proceedings. Moody did not
respond to questions.
   Freeman said public access into Moody-related documents could
jeopardize the investigation if a conspiracy is involved.
   Agents investigating the mail bombs have extensively searched
the homes and businesses of three men in Alabama and Georgia,
including Moody's Clayton County home two weeks ago.
   No one has been charged in the attacks, which killed Judge
Robert S. Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and
Robert Robinson, a Savannah attorney.

   Once there were 28 categories of Grammy awards.
Now there are 76. But unlike TV's Emmy Awards show, which has
become an epic in bloat, CBS' telecast of the Grammy awards moved
along right smartly.
   True, Wednesday night's 32nd annual Grammy Awards show from Los
Angeles, aired live only on the East Coast, ran 37 minutes over its
three-hour schedule. True, host Garry Shandling was a tad less than
exuberant.
   But you rarely had the feeling, as one often does on Emmy night,
that every single winner would get to say thanks to everyone the
winner knew, be it mother, agent, or third assistant cousin.
   There was a whole lot of thankin' going on, make no mistake. The
laconic jazz great, Miles Davis, did it in two short bursts, saying
``Thank you,'' and, upon sighting a standing ovation for him,
saying ``Thank you again.''
   Two other winners were even moved to thank their lawyers.
   But executive producer Pierre Cossette, who has been doing
Grammy shows almost since the golden age of silent television,
fashioned a well-paced evening.
   He gave a representative sampling of tunes and music forms,
presenters who got to the point fast, and surprisingly few overly
grateful winners.
   The music world's annual salaam to itself only really sagged
when it spent about 20 minutes hailing the thoughts, words, music
and video clips of Paul McCartney, whose name often is prefaced
with the phrase ``Former Beatle.''
   All this salute lacked was the intelligence that Fellow Former
Beatle George Harrison had his tonsils taken out on Feb. 8, 1969.
   McCartney proved a gracious visitor, though. He didn't even
wince at the preliminaries, a solemn speech by Beatles fan Meryl
Streep.
   She or her speechwriter left the impression that he could make
the the lame walk and the tone-deaf hear, noting that his fine
music not only had an impact on rock 'n' roll but ``also on Western
culture.''
   The McCartney hoopla was due to his Grammy-knighting for a
lifetime of musical achievement. Davis was similarly honored,
although late in the show, when it was in overtime. But he played
his horn and sounded fine.
   Wednesday's show, which among other things featured the first
televised Grammy award for rap music, served as a reminder that
rock no longer is for and by the young.
   There were a few sprouts about on stage, notably the
distinguished new rock group Milli Vanilli, which has one recent
hit with lyrics that go ``girl, you know it's true, ooo, ooo, ooo
...''
   But you also saw that rock 'n' roll is here to gray. There was
McCartney, youthful-looking, but 47. And Grammy winner Bette
Midler, only three years younger. And four-time winner Bonnie
Raitt, 40.
   We all get ancient. It's part of life's rich pageant. But you
just don't think of rock stars getting ancient, too. The Grammy
show, however, disproved this notion.
   It left a distinct feeling that if someone ever makes a TV
series about today's rock stars, it probably will be called
``fortysomething.''

<HEAD>Bureau of Prisons Will Take Over Leper Colony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only leper colony in the continental
United States will be converted to a health care center for elderly
and crippled federal prisoners, officials said.
   U.S. Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La., said Wednesday that the
agreement between the Bureau of Prisons and the Public Health
Service should be signed early next week.
   The 130 leprosy patients who live at the Gillis W. Long Hansen's
Disease Center in Carville about 70 miles west of New Orleans would
be allowed to remain, Holloway said.
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' Holloway said.
   The 340-acre facility, in an isolated curve of river, will be
able to hold about 1,000 prisoners, he said.
   It was the last U.S. Public Health Service hospital in the
country. The federal research project on leprosy, now known as
Hansen's disease, will be moved from the center 20 miles up the
Mississippi River to Baton Rouge.
   The colony opened in 1894 on an old plantation. The federal
government took control in 1921 and as many as 500 residents lived
there during the 1930s.
   The center has treated nearly 3,000 patients and survived the
1984 Reagan administration budget cuts when seven other Public
Health Service hospitals closed.
   All major advances in leprosy treatment _ drugs,
armadillo-related discoveries and two generations of vaccines with
limited effectiveness _ came from Carville's researchers, said
center Director John Duffy.
   Leprosy, a bacterial infection, causes nerve damage that can
result in loss of muscle control, crippling of the hands and feet
and blindness. Most cases can be treated before complications set
in and treatment makes the disease non-contagious.
   Two hundred to 300 new cases are diagnosed every year, with an
estimated 10,000 U.S. victims and 20 million worldwide.

   Gunmen ambushed a jeep in the
central Philippines, killing an American, his Filipino wife and
father-in-law, the military and U.S. officials said today.
   A report by the Philippine Constabulary said the killings took
place Wednesday along a highway on Bohol island, 400 miles
southeast of Manila. The American was identified as John Robert
Mitchell, 42, of Fairbanks, Alaska.
   U.S. Consul Franklin Huddle confirmed the American victim's
identity, but said he did not know what Mitchell did in the
Philippines or how long he has been in the country.
   The constabulary report said assailants fled after firing M-16s
and rifles at the jeep that Mitchell drove. Mitchell was fatally
shot, as was his wife, Marilou Chatoo, 24, and her father, Silvino.
   The military said it was investigating whether the attack was
carried out by Communist rebels, who operate in the area.

   A meeting between President
F.W. de Klerk and leaders of five black African nations has been
postponed following protests from opposition groups and other
nations, government officials said today.
   In a statement, the government said de Klerk would not be

beyond citing fighting in Angola.
   The apparent setbacks came at a time when South African

the way for diplomatic and trade ties with black African nations
after years of isolation.
   South African officials said earlier this week that de Klerk
would meet the leaders of Burundi, the Central African Republic,
Chad, Rwanda and Zaire in the first summit between South Africa and
black African nations. The meeting was presented as a major
breakthrough.
   It reportedly was arranged by Zaire's president, Mobutu Sese
Seko.
   But the African National Congress, the main South African
anti-apartheid group, protested and urged the Organization of
African Unity to block the meeting. The ANC said the South African
government still supported apartheid and any contacts by black
African nations would be premature.
   Several other black states condemned the meeting with de Klerk
and urged the participants not to take part. Chad denied it had
been been invited.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and released top black leader Nelson
Mandela from prison this month to try and clear the way for talks
on ending white minority rule and sharing political power with
blacks.
   The ANC has said it will send a delegation to meet with de Klerk
on trying to clear the way for talks on a new constitution.

   Recording stars arriving at the Grammy awards
came face to face with hundreds of squealing, photo-snapping fans,
including two surprised with free tickets.
   One performer had a hard time getting in.
   Singer Robirt Pilatus of Milli Vanilli scuffled with a guard
when the long-haired performer was denied entry to the show staged
at the Shrine Auditorium.
   ``Yeah, I had some problems out there. I wanted to get in and I
couldn't. I didn't know this gentleman was a police officer,'' said
Pilatus. ``He wanted to arrest me. They found out I was innocent.''
   A mysterious benefactor approached the ogling fans, asked if
anyone wanted tickets and handed a pair to Carrie Palmer, 19.
   ``I'd like to thank the lady, but I don't know who she is,''
said Miss Palmer, who gave the other ticket to a friend. Ticket
brokers were fetching prices as high as $1,000 per ticket.
   Limousines, Porsches and Jaguars pulled up three-deep outside
the auditorium and recording artists emerged in the hottest
fashions, mostly rock 'n' roll black and chic metallics.
   Elva Torres said that Donny Osmond, staging a musical comeback,
seemed to her to be the nicest and most sincere celebrity.
   ``He rolled down the window and let the girls shake his hand. He
also gave them autographs,'' she said. ``I thought that was really
nice.''
   Screams broke out when George Michael arrived.
   ``Oh my God. He is, like, the sexiest man alive,'' said
17-year-old Jennifer DeLadurantey.
   Miss DeLadurantey's friend, Jill Dunleavy, 17, said, ``He turned
around and all I could do is take a snapshot.''
   Dianne Rendon of Whittier was hoping to see Paula Abdul or Paul
McCartney, but never got the opportunity. Still, she said that
waiting eight hours was not all in vain.
   ``It was worth it for my daughter, who saw the New Kids on the
Block,'' said Ms. Rendon.
   Nearby, about 20 members of the Guardian Angels, a self-styled
crime patrol, set up a picket line to denounce nominations for the
hard rock group Guns N' Roses and the rap group Public Enemy.
   ``They've singled out two groups that are promoting hate and
violence in their records,'' said Angel leader Paul Barrera.
   Guns N' Roses, nominated for best hard rock performance for the
album ``GN'R Lies,'' offends blacks, immigrants, and homosexuals,
Barrera said.
   Public Enemy, nominated for best rap performance with the single
``Fight the Power,'' is ``going after the Jewish community,''
Barrera claimed.

   The defense minister says the
army won't block an inquiry into charges that he and other top
generals were linked to a secret unit that killed anti-apartheid
activists, according to reports today.
   The opposition Democratic Party called for Defense Minister Gen.
Magnus Malan's dismissal. The liberal party's leader, Wynand Malan,
said the government must remove the minister immediately or it will
be seen as supporting death squads.
   Gen. Malan denied he had ordered any killings or been involved
in any illegal activities, the state South African Broadcasting
Corp. reported. He said an investigation would exonerate the
defense forces.
   Malan made the statement pledging no army interference in the
investigation after The Star newspaper reported Wednesday that it
had uncovered evidence that Malan and senior generals were linked
to ``the activities of a secret South African Defense Force unit
allegedly linked to death squad operations.''
   The Star, citing unidentified sources, reported that Malan and
other senior officials were linked to a secret unit called the
Civil Cooperation Bureau, which used civilian personnel to conceal
the army's attempts to manipulate political affairs.
   The newspaper reported the chain of command for the unit ran
from Malan's office to Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, chief of the South
African Defense Forces; to Gen. Witkop Badenhorst, chief of
military intelligence; and to Maj. Gen. Eddie Webb.
   The unit, funded by the military, was commanded by Col. Johan
Verster, who reported directly to Webb, the newspaper said. The
report was the first to directly link death squad allegations to
senior military figures.
   The unit ran up to 16 ``cells'' across South Africa and its
activities were controlled by a special ``operations committee''
composed of Defense Force generals, the newspaper said. The unit
also monitored black trade unions and helped coordinate action
against activists based in other nations, it said.
   Malan had been aware of the secret unit since it was set up in
1987, the newspaper reported.
   In a report today, The Star said hundreds of thousands of
dollars in military funds had been misused by the secret unit to
buy BMWs and other luxury cars, pay for houses and underwrite
agents' lavish lifestyles.
   The lavish spending alarmed senior generals who began a secret
inquiry to try and stop the abuses, the newspaper reported.
   President F.W. de Klerk last month ordered an investigation into
charges that military and police squads killed government
opponents. The commission is expected to investigate the
unexplained deaths of at least 60 anti-apartheid activists over the
past decade.
   Three former police officers have confessed publicly to being
involved in death squad activities and several police officers are
under investigation for alleged involvement in death squad kilings.
   No military officers have been charged or suspended in
connection with the allegations.
   Malan said the attention focused on the death squad claims was
diverting attention from anti-government groups that had killed
hundreds of people.
   ``The actions of terrorists and aggressors who have claimed
hundreds of innocent lives are being pushed into the background,''
Malan was quoted as saying today by Johannesburg newspapers.
   The president has legalized the African National Congress and
other anti-apartheid groups as part of efforts to start talks on
ending white-minority rule and sharing political power with blacks.
   De Klerk has curbed the power of the security forces since
taking office in August.

   A convicted murderer lost his bid to attend his
mother's funeral after a judge upheld a state statute passed in
response to the Willie Horton case.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Prince on Wednesday refused to grant
an appeal by the American Civil Liberties Union to allow Philip
Pennellatore to pay his respects on Friday to the woman he called
his ``best friend.''
   The ruling upheld a state law barring the temporary release of
inmates serving life sentences for first-degree murder.
   The law was passed because of the furor over Horton's assault on
a Maryland couple while on furlough _ a key issue used by President
Bush to cast doubt on Gov. Michael S. Dukakis during the 1988
presidential race.
   Pennellatore, 29, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1982
for the 1981 killing of an 80-year-old retired librarian. He is
serving a life sentence at the Old Colony Correctional Institute in
Bridgewater.
   Pennellatore originally asked for a court injunction to see his
mother, dying of pancreatic cancer, on Feb. 5. Then he sought to
attend her funeral. Nettie Pennellatore, 61, died Tuesday.
   ``It's good prison management. It's humane,'' said John
Reinstein, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represented Pennellatore.
   Reinstein said Pennellatore and other inmates who have filed
separate suits against the state Department of Correction argue
that the Willie Horton law is an ex post facto law.
   ``It basically went back and imposed additional punishment on
prisoners already convicted of crimes,' Reinstein said.
   Corrections Department spokeswoman Kathy Robertson said it would
take a court order or special legislation to allow a convicted
lifer out for any occasion. Only three other states in the United
States have no furlough system, she said.
   But the sponsor of the so-called ``Willie Horton statute,'' Rep.
Larry Giordano, a Democrat, said he was not aware the bill banned
prisoners from attending family funerals.
   ``I would have no problem with that,'' Giordano said. ``You only
have one mother and father. Keeping first-degree murderers behind
bars is important to me, but I have a little compassion.''
   Maureen Donovan, who spearheaded the anti-furlough campaign,
said she agreed with the policy.
   ``He was the cause of a funeral himself,'' said Donovan. ``If
they let him out, they are breaking the law.''

   A Tehran newspaper said today that the
foreign hostages held in Lebanon should be freed because they are
being used as a propaganda tool against Iran.
   It was the first known statement by an Iranian newspaper
advocating the release of all the captives.
   The English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial that
freeing the hostages was in line with Islamic and humanitarian
principles, according to excerpts carried by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
   ``Regardless of the West's propaganda ploys, Moslem forces, out
of Islamic and humanitarian considerations, should work to get the
hostages free with no precondition,'' IRNA quoted the editorial as
saying.
   Most of the 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon are believed
in the hands of extremist Shiite Moslem factions loyal to Tehran.
Eight are Americans; the longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   Asked about the Tehran Times editorial, Anderson's sister, Peggy
Say, said: ``I am deeply grateful. It is encouraging. I consider
that Iran is not part of the problem, but part of the solution.''
   The hostages' fate is believed linked to a power struggle within
the Iranian government. The Times is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who has offered to help free the hostages before but
has been criticized for such moves by hard-line government factions.
   The editorial said the fight against Western influence in the
Middle East was a legitimate one and should continue, but that all
the forces in Lebanon should work to free the hostages regardless
of their nationality.
   ``They should regard the hostages as victims of imperialist
policies of the West and make attempts to get them all freed,'' the
newspaper said.
   ``Maybe 1990 will be the year for the release of all the
hostages,'' the newspaper said.
   The IRNA report, monitored in Nicosia, said the West did not
attach practical value to the hostage issue, assigning more
importance to Westerners missing than those from other countries.
   The newspaper repeated Rafsanjani's demand for the release of
Iran's charge d'affaires in Beirut, Mohsen Musavi, and three other
embassy staff members missing for nearly eight years.
   The four were kidnapped by Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen
in north Lebanon in July 1982 and are believed to have been killed.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea, who took over the
militia in 1986, has said he found no trace of the men. He blamed
his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, for their disappearance and apparent
slaying.
   Geagea's disclosure in 1988 was the first formal comment by the
militia that it had been involved in seizing the Iranians.
   The Westerners missing in Lebanon include eight Americans, four
Britons, an Italian, an Irishman, two West Germans and two Swiss.
   Mrs. Say, of Cadiz, Ky., and an Associated Press delegation are
currently on a trip to discuss with world leaders her campaign to
free her brother.
   Now in Damascus, Syria, she has already met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope John Paul II and
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Attempts to meet with Iranian leaders have not succeeded.
   During her meeting with Arafat last week, Mrs. Say was told that
Rafsanjani had the greatest influence over the hostages but his
room to maneuver was limited by hard-liners in the government.
   Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former interior minister and
Rafsanjani's staunchest rival, regularly encourages the groups
holding hostages in Lebanon.
   The hostage-takers are believed linked to the Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which Mohtashemi helped organize.

   Divers wearing iron helmets used
sophisticated underwater camera gear to help them recover five more
bodies from iced-over Convict Lake, including two victims who were
at lake bottom.
   After pulling what was the sixth of seven drowning victims from
the lake late Wednesday, authorities halted the recovery effort to
give exhausted divers a chance to recuperate.
   ``Search efforts have been suspended, due to loss of resources
and safety factors,'' Mono County Sheriff Martin A. Strelneck said
in a statement. ``The divers are getting tired and cold, and it's
getting dangerous out there for them.''
   Divers from Los Angeles County and Washoe County, Nev., will
resume searching for the lone body still under the ice, but no time
was set to continue the effort, he said.
   The remaining body is that of Dave Meyers, 53, of Bishop. The
deaths caused by thin ice came Monday, Meyers' first day as a
counselor at Camp O'Neal, a facility for troubled youths.
   Three teen-agers from the camp were the first to plunge into the
bone-chilling waters of the high-altitude lake.
   Two bodies wrapped in yellow plastic bags were brought to shore
about 3:20 p.m. Wednesday, moments before an underwater video
camera found two more bodies at 100 feet.
   A fifth body was recovered before the operation ended for the
night.
   Divers on Tuesday recovered the body of Forest Service Ranger
Clayton Cutter, 31, one of four adults who died trying to save the
three floundering teen-agers.
   Recovered from the lake Wednesday were the bodies of camp
counselor Randy Porter, 39, of June Lake; volunteer firefighter
Vidar Anderson, 58, of Long Valley; and camp residents David
Christopher Sellers, 15, of Tulare; Shawn Rayne Diaz, 15, of
Dinuba; and Ryan Charles McCandless, 13, of Redlands.
   The victims' friends and relatives on Wednesday questioned U.S.
Forest Service policies that leave judging ice thickness up to
individual common sense at the hundreds of lakes in the rugged
Sierra Nevada range.
   ``They definitely need signs out there,'' said Tracey Wood, a
friend of Cutter. ``I know people are going to be rebellious, but
before they advertise a lake for ice skating they better let people
know how thin the ice is,'' she said.
   Convict Lake brochures tout its ice skating.
   A remote-controlled underwater camera lowered into the 32-degree
water helped divers locate two bodies on the lake bottom, 117 feet
below the surface, said Mono County sheriff's spokeswoman Gail
Merritt.
   The operation included a six-member Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department deep-diving team and 11 divers from Washoe County, Nev.
   The Los Angeles dive team had iron helmets and surface air
equipment allowing them to go deeper and stay down for up to 30
minutes. The camera guided them on the bottom of the 140-foot deep
lake.
   The tragedy struck while 16 teen-agers and two adults from Camp
O'Neal were on an outing at the lake at the 7,500-foot level in the
eastern Sierra Nevada.
   A preliminary sheriff's department investigation completed
Wednesday said the teen-agers were ``playing,'' not skating, on the
mile-long, quarter-mile wide lake.
   The investigation will be passed to the Mono County district
attorney's office and the state Department of Social Services, the
report said.
   Sheriff's investigator John Rutkowski said he was trying to
determine whether the teen-agers were properly supervised.
   Convict Lake, just south of the Mammoth ski resort about 250
miles north of Los Angeles, got its name from a shootout between a
posse and escaped convicts in the late 1800s.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney assured Japanese
officials today that no U.S. combat troops would be removed from
Japan if reductions in American military forces here are ordered, a
Pentagon spokesman said.
   The pledge came as Cheney met for more than two hours with his
Japanese counterpart, Defense Minister Juro Matsumoto, according to
Cheney spokesman Pete Williams.
   Cheney also met with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,
congratulating him on his conservative party's re-election victory
in Sunday's election, and separately with Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama.
   Cheney was in Japan on the final leg of his two-week Asian tour,
in which he has been consulting with allied nations about Pentagon
proposals to reduce the 120,000 U.S. troops stationed in the
Pacific Rim by 10 to 12 percent. That would amount to a possible
cut of 5,000 military personnel from Japan alone.
   About 50,000 U.S. Marines, sailors, soldiers and Air Force
personnel are based in Japan and Okinawa.
   Cheney ``did discuss numbers'' about a possible troop withdrawal
with Matsumoto, Williams said, but he provided no details.
   The Pentagon chief told his Japanese counterpart that ``if we do
reduce our forces in the region, it will be done without affecting
our combat capabilities,'' Williams said.
   Assuring Matsumoto the United States remains committed to
helping maintain peace in the Pacific, Cheney said America ``will
continue to modernize and upgrade'' the forces and military
hardware based in the region.
   Cheney is due to report to Congress by April 1 with a
reassessment of the U.S. military role in the Pacific. Some
lawmakers have called for severe drawdowns in troops levels based
in economically robust nations overseas, given the reduced
superpower tensions and budget deficit worries at home.
   Cheney told the Japanese that no final decision has been made on
manpower cuts, nor which units in Japan might be affected. Such
decisions will be made by Adm. Huntington Hardisty, the U.S.
Commander in Chief of the Pacific, and U.S. military commanders in
Japan, in consultation with the allies, Williams said.
   Williams said the two officials had a ``very broad discussion''
about a possible increase in Japanese financial support for
Americans based here, but ``no figures, no specifics'' were
mentioned.
   U.S. officials have said in the past that Cheney is looking for
a ``sizeable increase'' in the $2.4 billion the Japanese contribute
to the $7 billion cost of maintaining U.S. forces here.
   The lack of specifics about numbers is a negotiating tactic, one
U.S. official said, noting that the Japanese ``understand our
requirements'' and are willing to increase their financial support
for such things as recreational facilities and hospitals to help
U.S. troops and their families.
   In South Korea and Asia, the Americans are looking to the host
governments to pick up more of the tab for such things as utility
costs and local wages for their own citizens working on the bases.
   Earlier in Cheney's travels, one U.S. official said a doubling
of host nations' contributions would be a desirable goal.
   Because this is Cheney's first visit to the region as defense
secretary, the sessions were primarily ``get-acquainted'' talks,
with each side laying out for the other their global views in light
of the revolutionary changes that have swept Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, Williams said.
   The officials found that they shared ``very similar views,''
Williams said, both taking ``a very cautious approach'' to events
in the Soviet Union.
   ``Both sides expressed the view that whatever changes may be
going on in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the fundamental
picture in Asia and the Pacific hasn't changed. Nor should either
country's strategy in the region change,'' Williams said.
   Later, Foreign Minister Nakayama told Cheney it was important to
continue enhancing U.S.-Japan cooperation, said a Foreign Ministry
official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Nakayama said Japan hopes the United States will remain a
Pacific power and keep forward-deployed forces in the region
despite the possible cuts, according to the official.
   The official said Kaifu told Cheney that Japan was willing to
work closely with the United States on ensuring cuts would not
affect basic combat strength.
   Regarding Japan's share of the cost of maintaining U.S. troops,
Kaifu said Japan had already substantially increased its share and
would build in the future, the official said.
   Cheney has stressed throughout his travels that despite some
reductions in the Soviet Navy, it still retains its largest fleet
in the Pacific and has more than 500,000 troops based in Asia. And
in spite of Soviet moves to lessen tensions with the West, nations
such as South Korea still feel threatened by such militaristic
powers as Communist North Korea.
   Cheney delivers a major policy speech on Friday before the
National Press Club here, and then travels to Kyoto as a guest of
the Japanese Defense Agency.
   He returns to Washington on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   East German officials today disputed a report
that former spymaster Markus Wolf fled East Germany for Moscow,
saying he was only taking a vacation in the Soviet Union and was
not under investigation for illegal arms deals.
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich reported that Wolf
had taken refuge in the Soviet Union to avoid possible arrest in
connection with a weapons scandal that occurred under the ousted
hard-line Communist regime.
   Wolf, who led East Germany's espionage operations for 20 years,
is believed to have had close ties to the KGB and once called the
Soviet Union his ``second home.''
   The official East German news agency ADN said Wolf and his
family went on vacation in the Soviet Union on Feb. 12 and would
return soon.
   Eberhard Meier, a personal assistant to Wolf, told the news
agency the former spy was also working on the Russian-language
version of a book published after his retirement from the
intelligence service.
   Meier denied that Wolf fled to the Soviet Union to avoid
possible prosecution in connection with an arms exporting operation.
   Hans-Juergen Joseph, East Germany's chief prosecutor, was quoted
by West German newspaper Bild as saying: ``There is no
investigation against Markus Wolf.''
   Bild quoted Gregor Gysi, chairman of the former Communist Party,
as saying Wolf was expected back ``next week.'' The party is now
renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism.
   Gysi called everything else in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung report
``pure nonsense.''
   The Munich newspaper reported that East German prosecutors
believe Wolf was involved in the illegal arms operation and may
even have directed it.
   East German authorities have said the exports were handled by
Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, chief foreign trader for the ousted
Communist government.
   He fled to West Berlin when the operation was discovered in
December and spent several days in jail, but a judge said there
were no grounds in West Germany for holding Schalck-Golodkowski and
released him in January.
   Wolf, 67, retired in February 1987 from the State Security
Ministry, where he was in charge of the espionage section and
directed such agents as Guenter Guillaume, whose unmasking led to
the resignation of Willy Brandt as West German chancellor in 1974.
Guillaume had been one of Brandt's closest aides.
   In the October turmoil that brought down hard-line Communist
Party chief Erich Honecker, he supported the type of political and
economic reforms championed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet
president.
   Wolf joined the State Security Ministry in 1951, became
espionage chief in 1957 and retired with the rank of general.
   His career was said to have inspired spy novelist John Le
Carre's character Karla, a fictional Soviet spymaster who finally
is forced to defect to the West by an elaborate plot devised by
British agent George Smiley.
   After decades of virtual invisibility, Wolf spoke at rallies in
the early days of East Germany's peaceful street revolution and
appeared in several discussions on East and West German TV.
   There is an arrest warrant out for him in West Germany because
of his espionage activities.

   Soldiers wielding truncheons fired
tear gas and charged more than 300 demonstrating students today,
beating dozens as they sang the national anthem in an
anti-government protest at a university.
   Armed police wearing riot helmets sealed off the campus in the
Cocody section of Abidjan, where the state university, presidential
palace and many embassies and ambassadorial residences are located.
   One resident said police and soldiers also fired tear gas at
students who fled the campus and tried to continue the protest.
   ``One canister exploded just a couple of meters from my car as I
drove toward my home near the Austrian Embassy. I dare not leave my
house,'' one resident said on condition of anonymity.
   About 200 students gathered later outside the walled offices of
state-run Radio Abidjan yelling: ``Tell the truth! Tell the
truth!'' as soldiers and police attacked them with batons.
   State newspapers, television and radio have remained silent
about unrest, which began late Monday when students angered by cuts
in water and power demanded the resignation of conservative
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   The Ivorian League of Human Rights appealed today to judges to
intercede on behalf of 23 students it said were detained Monday
night.
   Trucks of police and soldiers patrolled residential areas and
shopping centers surrounding the state university.
   It was the most serious unrest in years in Ivory Coast, where
the pro-Western government is struggling against a recession that
brought unemployment, salary cuts and declining living standards to
one of Africa's richest countries.
   Houphouet-Boigny, officially stated as 84 years old but believed
in his 90s, has ruled Ivory Coast as a one-party state since its
independence from France in 1960.
   Students said many of protesters were hurt in protests this week
but only a few seriously enough to warrant treatment at the
hospital. Hospital officials said they were not authorized to
comment.
   On Monday night, police beat students who set two cars ablaze
outside a university residence in the poor suburb of Yopougon,
three miles from the main campus. Protesters said one student was
beaten to death Monday night, but it was not possible to verify the
claim.
   On Tuesday, students smashed windows of two buses after bus
service was suspended between the main campus and the many
university residences sprawled across Abidjan, the capital.
   Today, more than 300 students protested peacefully outside the
rector's office at the university singing: ``Greetings, land of
hope,'' the national anthem. Police charged them with truncheons.
   Earlier, some students tried to attend classes but were
disturbed by about 20 militant students demanding, ``Come out! Come
out!''
   Soldiers and police marched in, and beat both protesters and
students trying to study. ``Not all the students are protesting,
but we all agree that there have to be changes in Ivory Coast,'' a
chemistry student said.
   He said there are no apparent leaders among the 20,000 students
because the government prevents students from forming independent
groups.
   Among demands the protesters presented Wednesday to rector Toure
Bakary is dissolution of a students' union that serves as a youth
league of the ruling Democratic Party. On Wednesday the students
tore up the red, green and orange party flag that flew over the
university.

<HEAD>Doctors Optimistic About Transplant Recovery Despite Setback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors stopped the bleeding from 12-year-old
Stormie Jones' newest liver and remained optimistic the world's
first heart-liver transplant recipient would recover.
   Stormie, from the Fort Worth, Texas, suburb of White Settlement,
remained in critical condition today at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
   Doctors on Wednesday reconstructed a connection between the
donor liver and the hepatic artery, a blood vessel that supplies
the liver, Dr. Andreas Tzakis said.
   ``The liver looks good and we expect her to recover promptly,''
said Tzakis, who headed a team that operated for nine hours to stop
bleeding from sutures that had given way and to check all other
sutures.
   Internal bleeding occurs in about 10 percent of all patients
receiving a second transplant, he said.
   Stormie, who was given a new heart and liver six years ago,
received her second liver during a 10-hour procedure Tuesday.
   Stormie did not appear upset that she required more surgery,
Tzakis said.
   ``She's determined to make it, no matter what,'' he said.
   Stormie's stepfather, Alan Purcell, 27, said the girl's feisty
attitude has helped family members.
   ``How can we get down when she stays up?'' he said.
   Stormie's first transplant was needed to control effects of a
rare disease that left her with cholesterol levels 10 times normal.
The second operation resulted from permanent liver damage due to
hepatitis caused by an unknown virus. Her donor heart has remained
healthy.

   An attorney representing one of five white
supremacists on trial for hate crimes told the jury the men were
falsely accused of plotting against minorities.
   ``There will be fliers, writings on the wall and other things
that will get your emotions up,'' attorney Leon Carter said
Wednesday in his opening statement. ``You will find that these men
are not guilty of the conspiracy that is alleged.''
   Carter has declined to comment about the case outside the U.S.
District courtroom.
   He is representing Jon Lance Jordan, 19, of Garland, who is on
trial with Sean Christian Tarrant, 20, and Daniel Alvis Wood, 20,
of Dallas; Michael Lewis Lawrence, 22, of Tulsa, Okla.; and
Christopher Barry Greer, 25, of Irving.
   All are charged with violating the civil rights of Jews by
defacing a synagogue in 1988. Greer, Tarrant and Jordan are also
accused of civil rights violations by allegedly chasing blacks and
Hispanics from a Dallas park, also in 1988.
   The defendants are members of a skinhead faction called the
Confederate Hammerskins. The skinhead subculture, so-called because
its members sport severely short haircuts, originated in London in
the 1960s. Segments of the movement have taken on Nazi beliefs in
recent years, and since have been supported by and associated with
white-supremacist groups.
   Wood talked about putting cyanide gas into the air conditioning
system of Temple Shalom, a north Dallas synagogue, said Gordon Gene
Buchanan, a former Hammerskin member.
   Buchanan said he accompanied Jordan, Tarrant and Wood to the
synagogue on an August night in 1988 and that he saw Jordan and
Wood near the outside air conditioner units, but he couldn't see
what they were doing.
   Dan L. Kraus of Temple Shalom testified that a number of the
synagogue's members discussed leaving the congregation after
vandalism that included anti-Semitic graffiti, gunshots into walls
and windows and damage to the air conditioning system.
   One piece of graffiti said, ``6 million more,'' referring to the
Holocaust, in which millions of Jews were killed in concentration
camps.
   Buchanan also testified that Tarrant attacked a black man and a
white woman who was with an Hispanic man in separate incidents at
Robert E. Lee Park, which prosecutors say the skinheads believed
should not be visited by non-whites.
   Alexis Charles Newton of Dallas, who is black, testified that he
was chased from the park by white youngsters, some with closely
shaven heads.
   ``I was scared. I knew what could happen if they caught me,''
Newton said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said after the indictments were
issued in September that prosecution of racial hate crimes is a
priority of the Justice Department.
   Each of the federal charges carries up to 10 years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
   Wood already has been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined
$5,000 by a state judge for spraying swastikas and anti-Semitic
slogans on the synagogue.
   Eleven other Hammerskins have been charged; three out of five
adults and four of six juveniles pleaded guilty.

<TEXT>
   Before The Donald, there was Herr Winklmayr.
   Ivana Trump, the wife of billionaire developer Donald Trump, was
married briefly in the early 1970s to an Austrian skier, according
to her lawyer, Michael Kennedy.
   Kennedy called Mrs. Trump's 1971 marriage to Alfred Winklmayr a
``Cold War marriage'' that allowed her to travel under an Austrian
passport out of Communist Czechoslovakia, her homeland. They were
divorced in 1973.
   ``They never slept together,'' Kennedy said. ``They never lived
together.'' Winklmayr, a ski instructor, and Mrs. Trump, who was a
world-class skier, were friends and remain friends, Kennedy said at
a news conference Wednesday.
   The latest revelation since Trump announced he was leaving his
wife of 12 years came in response to ``inaccurate'' reports
published in the British tabloids, Kennedy said.
   He would not say what the inaccuracies were.
   But a report in the London Sun said Winklmayr was 60 when he wed
Mrs. Trump and died within two years of the marriage, leaving her
enough money to finance ``a new life in Canada,'' where she moved
in 1972.
   Kennedy said Winklmayr was 25 and Mrs. Trump was 22 when they
married.
   Trump knew about the marriage but her children, ages 12, 8 and
6, did not, Kennedy said.
   The Sun never used his first name, referring to him as ``Herr
Winklmayr.'' Herr is German for mister.
   Kennedy declined to answer questions about the Trumps'
prenuptial agreement, which reportedly would give Mrs. Trump $25
million, the house in Connecticut and custody of the three Trump
children, nor would he comment on a possible out-of-court
settlement.

   Poets and politicians joined to praise black
nationalist Malcolm X on the 25th anniversary of his assassination,
and one group circulated petitions calling for a holiday in his
honor.
   ``I couldn't believe it that everyone was calling out his
name,'' Malcolm's widow, Betty Shabazz, said after the
commemoration. Her husband had not been honored as vociferously in
the past, she said.
   ``I say time brings about a change,'' Mrs. Shabazz said.
   More than 1,000 gathered Wednesday at Abyssinian Baptist Church
to remember Malcolm X, and an additional 600 people were turned
away.
   Malcolm X was killed Feb. 21, 1965, while speaking at a ballroom
in Manhattan. He was 39. Three members of the Nation of Islam were
convicted of the murder; Malcolm X had broken with the group in the
year before his death.
   Haki Madhubuti, a poet and publisher of Third World Press in
Chicago, said he thinks of the slain leader every day and displays
his picture over his desk.
   ``He was the man who gave my generation a voice,'' Madhubuti
said.
   While the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached civil
disobedience and non-violence, Malcolm X emphasized separatism and
self-defense.
   Percy Sutton, a former state lawmaker and Manhattan borough
president, remembered his first meeting with the activist minister.
Sutton said Malcolm X told him: ``People like you don't want to be
associated with people like me.''
   But Sutton became Malcolm X's attorney, and his client went on
to help him gain ``access to the corridors of power,'' he said.
   The National Malcolm X Commemoration Commission produced
Wednesday's event and proclaimed 1990 to be the Year of Malcolm X.
The commission circulated petitions to make his birthday, May 19,
an African-American day of commemoration.
   Also Wednesday, about 400 people met at the Audubon Ballroom
where Malcolm X was assassinated, and protested plans to demolish
the building.
   An observance was also held in Omaha, Neb., birthplace of
Malcolm X.

<HEAD>FAA to Issue New Warnings to Airlines and Controllers on Words to

<TEXT>
   Federal aviation officials said today they
would issue new warnings to airlines and controllers about the
proper words to use in dealing with a plane that is running out of
gas.
   The Federal Aviation Administration responded to urgent
recommendations Wednesday from the National Transportation Safety
Board in its investigation of the Avianca crash that killed 73
people in New York last month.
   Avianca pilots told controllers four times that they were
running out of fuel before their jetliner crashed, but the NTSB
said that wasn't enough. They should have declared a ``fuel
emergency,'' the safety board said.
   Pilots of the Colombian airliner apparently tried to tell
controllers of an emergency situation but failed to use the
language required by the FAA, the board said.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the agency would pass along the
safety board's concerns to all carriers and to its air traffic
controllers.
   ``We'll implement the recommendations as soon as possible,'' he
said.
   The board asked the FAA to notify all airliners using U.S. skies
that their pilots must be ``thoroughly knowledgeable'' about
required communications when fuel emergencies and other critical
problems occur.
   The four-member board, with one dissenting vote, also urged the
FAA to advise its own controllers of ``the need to request from
flight crews clarification of unclear or ambiguous transmissions
that convey a possible emergency.''
   Board member Jim Burnett said he did not sign on to the
recommendations because language in a letter to FAA Administrator
James Busey was toned down to be less critical of FAA controllers.
   The letter said the board was still investigating the crash and
``has not concluded that any specific communication or coordination
problems'' caused the accident.
   It said, however, that Flight 52 pilots should have declared a
``fuel emergency'' and air controllers should have asked them to
clarify their condition when they repeatedly said they were
``running out of fuel,'' the board said.
   Although transcripts of the flight recorder have not been made
public, the letter to Busey provided some details of the Avianca
pilots' appeals to controllers who were handling their flight. The
Boeing 707 airliner was delayed three different times for a total
of 77 minutes because of heavy traffic over the East Coast.
   The letter said the crew used ``non-standard phraseology'' in
telling controllers that the plane was low on fuel. Among
statements quoted were: ``We'll try once again, we're running out
of fuel,'' ``We just running out of fuel,'' and ``We just lost two
engines and we need priority please.''
   Fifty minutes before the crash, Avianca pilots told one
controller they could only ``hold about five minutes'' and two
minutes later they said they could not make it to an alternative
airport, Boston, because the jetliner ``will run out of fuel now.''
   The last question from the controller just before the crash was:
``You have, ah, you have enough fuel to make it to the airport?''
   The board said there was no response from the flight crew.
   FAA rules call for pilots to declare ``minimum fuel status''
when they need to land without undue delay and a ``fuel emergency''
when they should be given first priority for landing. The next step
would be a ``mayday'' call in the event of a ``distress condition.''
   None of the declarations was heard from Avianca 52 before it
crashed.
   The board said it was investigating three other incidents
involving problems in communications since the Avianca crash. Two
of these involved U.S. carriers and the third involved a foreign
carrier, officials said.
   The board said preliminary evidence in its investigation, which
is to be concluded in several months, indicates there may have been
``incomplete communication'' between the flight crew and
controllers at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, the
New York TRACON Control Center and the Kennedy tower.
   The board quoted one air traffic controller, whose identity was
not disclosed, as saying that had the flight crew advised that they
were ``fuel critical, (with) minimum fuel or in an emergency
situation,'' he would have provided them with emergency service.
   The FAA is not required to follow safety board recommendations.

<TEXT>
   Pasadena police tracked state-chartered
helicopters spraying Medfly-killing pesticide today and ordered
them to halt under a law that provides criminal penalties to
challenge the urban crop-dusting.
   The helicopter squadron was tracked within city air space flying
at 500 feet, a day after Pasadena's governing board adopted a
minimum altitude of 700 feet for nighttime helicopter formations,
said city director Rick Cole.
   Police contacted the helicopter group and issued a 1 a.m.
warning followed by an order to ``cease and desist'' the overflight
aimed at Mediterranean fruit flies, said Pasadena police Officer
Pat Carnighan.
   The measure enacted early Wednesday provides maximum penalties
of $1,000 and a year in jail.
   Pasadena police in their two helicopters did not write
citations. But when the choppers landed at El Monte Airport for
refueling this morning, Jim Josephson, the lead pilot for San
Joaquin Helicopters, was told the city would seek criminal
misdemeanor complaints, Carnighan said.
   The state hired El Monte-based San Joaquin Helicopters to carry
out its malathion spraying program.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office will have
final say over whether complaints might be filed.
   Police met with Josephson before the overnight spraying to
discuss the new ordinance and their planned enforcement action,
said Pasadena police Sgt. Tom Oldfield.
   ``I wouldn't want to make it like this was a play arranged for
everybody's benefit ... but we have gone down to talk to them and
we know what they're going to do and how they're going to do it,
and they know what we're going to do,'' Oldfield said.
   ``It's not like we're dealing with criminals,'' he said.
   The helicopters lifted off late Wednesday to spray a
53-square-mile area with the pesticide as part of the state's $30
million Medfly eradication campaign.
   The area sprayed in the operation that ended about 3 a.m. today
included 10 square miles in southeast Pasadena, a city of about
135,000 people.
   It also part or all of Rosemead, San Gabriel, Monrovia, Monterey
Park, South San Gabriel, northern Montebello, South El Monte, El
Monte, Norwood Village, parts of Alhambra, Temple City, Arcadia and
San Marino.
   The white Bell 204 helicopters flying in formation resembled a
nighttime military assault.
   Pasadena's ban was the most aggressive of local efforts to halt
spraying of malathion. Other cities have gone to court in hopes of
doing the same. Opponents say too little is known about the health
effects of the insecticide.
   However, the ban faces an uphill battle because Gov. George
Deukmejian has declared a state of emergency in response to the
Mediterranean fruit fly, and the declaration supersedes local
ordinances, said Dr. Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the state
Department of Food and Agriculture.
   ``If Pasadena wants to stop it, they'll have to use available
legal processes,'' Siddiqui said. ``They should exhaust legal
remedies instead of (this) showdown in the air.''
   Oldfield acknowledged that the swarm of state helicopters,
joined by city helicopters and probably by news helicopters as
well, pose a potentially hazardous situation in the air.
   But he said the city's brand of aerial warfare was expected to
serve as another route to court.
   The state is spraying 400 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange
counties to wipe out the worst infestation of Mediterranean fruit
flies since 1981-82.
   Agriculture officials have called the spraying a safe and
necessary step to prevent the Medfly from harming the state's
multibillion-dollar farm economy. The Medfly lays its eggs in more
than 250 varieties of fruits, vegetables and nuts grown in
California. The crops are destroyed when the larvae hatch and
growing maggots eat their way out.
   The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to take
the state to court over spraying. The cities of Pasadena, Glendale
and Burbank will join the lawsuit. The Los Angeles city attorney
was expected to file the suit today.
   Last month, the Orange County cities of Garden Grove, Huntington
Beach and Westminster filed suit in Superior Court. A judge refused
their request to stop spraying immediately.
   The Legal Aid Society of Orange County filed suit in federal
court, arguing the spraying violates the civil rights of homeless
people.
   Public concerns about pesticides in California also have
prompted campaigns to put voter initiatives on the November ballot
regulating their use. A proposed measure backed by
environmentalists would phase out the use of some chemicals linked
to cancer; a counterproposal from agriculture groups would give
farmers more flexibility.

<HEAD>Labor Leaders Threaten to Quit Over Peace Talks Compromise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party said
today they will quit the coalition Cabinet unless the right-wing
Likud bloc accepts a compromise plan to clear the way for
preliminary peace talks with Palestinians.
   Labor Party members said they wanted a Cabinet vote on the plan
in two weeks.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the No. 2 official in the Labor
Party, had been a staunch defender of retaining the coalition but
said today he changed his mind after Egypt approved a compromise
package on the makeup of a Palestinian delegation to the proposed
talks.
   ``Reasonable answers were given by the Egyptians to the United
States on everything that is linked to the composition of the
Palestinian delegation,'' Rabin said in an interview with Israel
army radio.
   ``If it becomes clear that the answers from the other (Arab)
side ... are positive, and ... if the delay comes from here, there
is doubt whether there is a point in the continuation of the
government,'' said Rabin.
   Egypt represents Palestinian positions in U.S.-brokered Middle
East peace efforts because Israel refuses to negotiate directly
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The 107-member Labor Bureau, which runs the party's day-to-day
affairs, met today to vote on a resolution calling for a Cabinet
decision by March 7 on the compromise. That would require
acceptance from Likud, which has opposed the compromise.
   The compromise calls for the Palestinian delegation to include
six residents of the occupied lands; two deportees brought back
from exile; and two residents of Israeli-annexed Arab east
Jerusalem who have other homes in the territories. Egypt would
announce the composition of the delegation.
   The compromise, which has U.S. backing, is intended to satisfy
PLO demands while recognizing Israel's formal insistence that it
will only negotiate with residents of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Environment Minister Ronnie Milo, a confidant of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, today reiterated Likud's opposition to the
compromise package.
   ``Deportees and east Jerusalem Arabs, this is something that is
not included in the initiative of the Israeli government,'' Milo
said on army radio.
   The government's initiative calls for Palestinian elections
leading to limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with
their final status to be decided in later talks.
   Shamir has rejected the participation of east Jerusalem
Palestinians but has not ruled out including deportees in a
Palestinian delegation.
   Labor's ultimatum increases pressure on Shamir, who is battling
hard-line Likud rebels trying to oust him as party leader.
   The hard-liners object to deportees or east Jerusalem Arabs
taking part in the talks. Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem after
it was captured from Jordan along with the West Bank in the 1967
Middle East war.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will lead a U.S.
delegation to presidential inaugurations in Chile and Brazil next
month, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy will accompany him to Chile, it
was announced today.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., who joined Quayle in the vice president's
office for the announcement, will be part of the official U.S.
delegation at the inauguration March 11 of Patricio Aylwin as
president of Chile. He was elected Dec. 14.
   Fernando Collor de Mello, who was elected Dec. 20, will be
inaugurated as president of Brazil on March 15. He recently met
with Quayle and President Bush in Washington.
   Quayle also is expected to make stops in Argentina, Paraguay and
Barbados.
   ``The restoration of democracy in Chile has been something which
the American people have felt extremely deeply about for a long
period of time. This has been an extremely painful process,''
Kennedy said, referring to that country's history of repressive
governments and human rights violations. ``This is another
indication of the winds of change that are taking place in the
world.''
   Kennedy said his participation in the U.S. delegation ``will be
an indication to the Chilean people of the strong support for the
restoration of democracy in Chile.''

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk today
welcomed an African National Congress proposal to send a delegation
for talks but criticized the group's adherence to guerrilla
violence.
   The ANC, which de Klerk legalized Feb. 2, says its armed
struggle remains a strategy to pressure the white-dominated
government to share power with the nation's black majority of 28
million.
   Last week, the ANC announced it would send a delegation from its
exile headquarters in Zambia to confer with de Klerk on how to
clear the way for negotiations on a new constitution.
   No date for the meeting has been set, and de Klerk said the
government would first have to address ``legal uncertainties'' in
regard to exiled ANC leaders who might be liable for prosecution in
South Africa.
   Although welcoming the ANC's decision to pursue talks, De Klerk
said it was ``disappointing that the ANC leadership continues to
talk about an armed struggle and hostilities at a time when most
South Africans, supported by the rest of the world, want peace.''
   ``The South African government is committed to a new
dispensation which offers peace and justice for all,'' de Klerk
said. ``An armed struggle and hostilities do not fit into this
pattern.''
   Recently released ANC leader Nelson Mandela helped launch the
ANC's guerrilla campaign in 1961, a year after the group was
outlawed. The bombing and sabotage campaign, however, has been
largely ineffective in the past year and poses no serious threat to
the government.
   De Klerk criticized the ANC for setting preconditions for the
start of formal negotiations. The ANC has said de Klerk must lift
the state of emergency and release all political prisoners before
formal talks can begin.
   De Klerk says he plans to lift the 3{-year-old state of
emergency soon and already has freed some political prisoners.
   The ANC seeks a one-man, one-vote democracy, which de Klerk
opposes, saying it will lead to black domination of the country's 5
million whites. De Klerk envisions some mechanism that would give
whites veto power on major policy decisions.

   Two elementary schools were closed after
officials stumbled onto potentially explosive medical supplies that
could have blown a hole the size of a ``decent-sized swimming
pool'' if they were mishandled.
   ``My wife's scared to death because we're living right here,''
said Dennis Jarrell, who has three children at Gasport Elementary
School, across the street from his house.
   Emergency hospital kits that were equipped with oxygen, nitrous
oxide and ether in the late 1950s and early 1960s were discovered
in the Gasport school and one in nearby Middleport by officials
looking to create more storage space.
   ``There's no set way to compare ... but you can probably compare
a container (of ether) to a stick of dynamite,'' said Fire Chief
Doug Winner. There were at least a dozen containers in the Gasport
school.
   A federal Environmental Protection Agency official today was to
inspect the basement storage room where officials stumbled across
the material Monday. It was not immediately clear whether the
original cache of chemicals was intact.
   Michael Shanley, head of Niagara County's Emergency Management
Office, said all ether in the county's schools had been removed in
1974 and none could be left in Gasport or Middleport.
   But Gary Brader, Royalton-Hartland school superintendent, said
there was no record that ether had been removed from either school.
He said the cases containing the emergency medical supplies did not
appear to have been opened.
   The portable operating rooms, which were stored in many public
buildings during the beginning of the Cold War, were established by
the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now known
as the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The emergency medical facilities were to serve as a civilian
version of a mobile army surgical hospital, or MASH unit, to be
available in case of a national emergency, said Bill Clark,
regional director for the state Emergency Management Office.
   A directive issued by the federal Office of Disaster
Preparedness in 1974 warned county emergency agencies about the
danger of dated ether and ordered the ``packaged disaster
hospitals'' be removed.
   Niagara County in western New York near the Canadian border had
seven such hospitals, according to Clark. ``Five were dismantled.
For some reason, these two weren't,'' he said.
   While no one's sure exactly how much of the material is stored
in the two schools, Gasport Fire Chief Doug Winner said there's
enough so that, if it exploded, ``You could probably make a
decent-sized swimming pool.''
   Brader said the school district had been trying to have
emergency officials remove the supplies from the school for years
``simply because we felt we needed space for storage.''
   Brader said it wasn't until Winner toured the basement storage
room Monday that he found out the material probably would have
exploded had it been moved.
   ``We're not dealing with canisters sitting in a shelf where
you'd walk in and see them,'' he said. ``We're talking about large
boxes and wooden crates that are sealed, that have signs from the
FBI saying they're not be touched.''
   Brader closed school for the 500 Gasport pupils Monday. Another
470 pupils at the Middleport school, five miles east, were sent
home Tuesday after officials learned of a similar portable hospital
in that building's basement.
   If the schools can't be reopened by next week, Brader said, the
district will set up double sessions at a nearby high school.
   Officials said an area up to a half-mile around the schools
might have to be cleared as a precaution, meaning several hundred
people might be displaced.

   A federal judge declared unconstitutional a law
passed by Congress to prohibit flag desecration, ruling that
Americans' right to burn their flag must be protected as
energetically as their right to wave it.
   Prosecutors said the challenge to the Flag Protection Act of
1989 may be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In dismissing flag burning charges against four people, U.S.
District Judge Barbara Rothstein on Wednesday ruled that the new
federal law is unconstitutional.
   ``In order for the flag to endure as a symbol of freedom in this
nation, we must protect with equal vigor the right to destroy it
and the right to wave it,'' she said.
   Mark Haggerty, Jennifer Campbell, Darius Strong and Carlos Garza
were charged with burning a U.S. flag outside a Seattle post office
shortly after midnight on Oct. 28, the day the flag protection law
went into effect.
   After the ruling, Strong set a flag on fire on the steps of the
U.S. Courthouse and spat on it as it burned.
   He released a statement, with Garza and Campbell, that called
the ruling a ``real victory for righteous people everywhere.''
   The case is the first constitutional challenge to the law,
according to David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights in
New York, which represented the four defendants.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Bartlett said the U.S. Attorney's
office, the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General will
decide whether to appeal directly to the Supreme Court, an avenue
provided for in the law, or to try the four demonstrators on
another charge.
   The center planned to argue the same issue today in a district
court in Washington, D.C., in a case involving three people who
burned flags on the steps of the Capitol, Cole said.
   He predicted both cases would end up before the Supreme Court.
   Congress passed the new law after the Supreme Court last June
overturned a Texas flag-burning conviction against Gregory Lee
Johnson. Johnson, who burned a flag at the 1984 Republican National
Convention, was among the spectators at a Feb. 14 hearing before
Rothstein.
   Rothstein cited the Johnson case in her decision, saying it
supported the conclusion that Congress is outlawing certain forms
of expression under the Flag Protection Act.
   ``The principle underlying the Supreme Court's decision last
summer was that the government can't compel people under penalty of
imprisonment to be patriotic and Rothstein's decision recognizes
that Congress' new law does exactly that,'' said Cole, who called
the decision ``wonderful.''
   The legislation prohibiting flag desecration was pushed by
Democratic congressional leadership in opposition to a Republican
plan for a constitutional amendment.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said in
Washington today, ``I wouldn't get too worked up about a district
court ruling. It's what we all exprected.'' The only significance
to the ruling, he added, is ``getting it (the issue) in a posture
where it now will go ... directly to the Supreme Court.''
   The four defendants had pleaded innocent and moved to have the
flag desecration charges dismissed on grounds the act violates the
First Amendment.
   Each of the four also was charged with one count of destruction
of U.S. government property, as the demonstration escalated from
the burning of small paper flags to burning a flag on the post
office flagpole. Rothstein was asked only to dismiss the
desecration charges and that is what she did in holding the law
unconstitutional.
   The flag desecration and destruction of property counts each
carry a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   Prosecutors were meeting to decide whether to take the remaining
count of property destruction to trial or take the issue directly
to the Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Airlines Change Position On Infant Safety Seats, Call For A Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's airline industry is asking the
Federal Aviation Administration to require that all infants be
fastened into approved safety seats when they fly aboard airliners.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents major carriers,
was filing a petition today urging the FAA to adopt new rules
affecting children under 2 years old, said ATA spokesman Steve
Hayes. The law currently allows infants to be held in the arms of
adult passengers.
   A rule requiring the seats would mean that infant passengers
would have to be ticketed. They currently fly free, and most
airlines allow safety seats to be used if empty seats are
available. Most car safety seats are also approved for airline use.
   The ATA previously recommended the use of safety seats for
passengers under 2 years old but, until today, did not favor a
federal rule requiring such use.

   Fifteen cities around the country will
share $27 million for programs to deter alcohol and drug abuse, the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced.
   The amount, to be spent over five years, is the largest sum from
a single private source to combat substance abuse.
   Urban cities and rural communities were selected, including an
area of northwestern New Mexico that covers portions of the Navajo
and Zuni reservations.
   Foundation president Dr. Leighton E. Cluff said Wednesday that
the program is aimed at developing successful models that can be
copied elsewhere.
   Each of the 15 communities, selected from 331 applicants, must
develop a program to reduce alcohol and illegal drug abuse among
residents.
   Planning would be done in each city by a coalition of educators,
health officials, law enforcement authorities and representatives
of labor, business, religious organizations and government agencies.
   Each municipality will receive $100,000 a year for at least two
years for planning and will be encouraged to seek additional
funding from outside sources. Eight of the 15 will then be chosen
to receive $3 million each to continue developing their models.
   The cities include Newark; Washington, D.C.; New Haven, Conn.;
Worcester, Mass.; West Charlotte, N.C.; San Antonio; Little Rock,
Ark.; Milwaukee; Kansas City, Mo.; Columbia, S.C.; and the
California cities of Vallejo, East Oakland, San Jose and Santa
Barbara.
   The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation describes itself as the
nation's largest private health care philanthrophy, with $2 billion
in assets and $100 million annually in grants. It is named for the
late son of one of the founders of the Johnson &amp; Johnson health
care products company.

<TEXT>
   Alaska could lose federal aid for cleaning
up the state's oil-fouled shores if it refuses to accept a plea
bargain with Exxon Corp., the state's top prosecutor said.
   Attorney General Douglas Baily said he doesn't like the pending
plea bargain over criminal charges for environmental damage from
the nation's largest oil spill.
   But if Alaska declines to be a party to the agreement, he said,
it could find itself stuck with the cleanup bills.
   At a briefing for state senators Wednesday, Baily said the state
also could lose control over any federal money that is spent.
   The U.S. Justice Department has refused to inform the state of
all the points contained in the agreement, making a decision
extremely difficult, he said.
   ``I feel the state is being overrun by the federal government,''
said Sen. Bettye Fahrenkamp of Fairbanks. ``I feel that somewhere
along the line we have to roar even when we're getting hit over the
head.''
   Justice Department and Exxon attorneys are expected to file the
plea bargain in federal court Friday, according to Baily. Today was
the deadline for the state to accept or reject it. Baily was to
make his recommendation today to Gov. Steve Cowper.
   The state has worked with Justice Department lawyers on the case
over the past five months, Baily said. But he said he doesn't know
if the state's suggestions have been followed.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard and Exxon announced that the oil
company will resume its cleanup of Prince William Sound and the
Gulf of Alaska on May 1, weather permitting. Exxon suspended its
cleanup in September for the winter and had not set a date for
further work.
   The extent of the work will not be determined until April,
spokesman Joe Tucker said, adding it would be ``substantially
smaller'' than efforts last year.
   The company found serious problems along about 10 of the 90
miles of shore its crews surveyed, said Hann Jahns, an Exxon
scientist.
   The March 24 spill occurred when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on
a reef in Prince William Sound. The tanker leaked nearly 11 million
gallons of crude oil in the clear waters of the sound, killing
countless birds and other wildlife.
   No criminal charges have been filed against Exxon in federal
court. The state had decided early in the legal process to
concentrate on civil litigation and allow the federal government to
handle criminal charges against Exxon.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Casner said negotiations were under way,
but provided no details on the settlement, which could resolve
criminal charges against the company.
   Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston also declined to comment.
   The Wall Street Journal reported a week ago that Exxon's plea
bargain included a $500 million fund for cleanup and restoration
expenses.
   The account was criticized by an attorney designated by state
and federal courts to help direct the dozens of civil lawsuits
filed against Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.
   Attorney Kenneth Adams of Washington, D.C., said it would allow
Exxon to say, ``Hey, we already paid for the damage to natural
resources,'' and possibly use it as an excuse to avoid civil
penalties.
   Adams said he plans to seek court postponement of any plea
bargain until parties in the civil cases are allowed a chance to
study it.
   Baily said, however, he believed the plea bargain would not take
away any rights from the state or other civil litigants seeking
damages from Exxon.

<HEAD>Soviets Confirm No Direct Flights To Israel in Offing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced today it will not allow
direct air flights to Israel, bowing to Arab concerns that some
Soviet Jewish emigrants might be settled in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   The decision followed weeks of campaigning by Arab countries
against the direct flights, despite Israeli claims that it has no
policy of settling Soviet Jews in the occupied lands.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev told a news
briefing, ``We do not exclude completely the development of
relations with Israel, including international flights, but we
think a direct air link presupposes a certain level and character
of relations between the U.S.S.R. and Israel.
   ``And at present it is completely out of the question to have
such an air bridge, an air link, in order to take emigrants to
Israel,'' Perfiliev said.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with Israel after
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, in which Israel seized the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Moscow has made Israel's withdrawal from the
territories a condition for restoring ties.
   But the Soviet state-run airline Aeroflot began negotiations
last year with Israel's El Al airlines for direct flights between
Tel Aviv and Moscow. They signed an agreement that would have
started the flights Jan. 1.
   The Soviets came under pressure from Arab countries and
Palestinian groups concerned about possible settlement of emigrants
in the occupied lands. U.S. officials said Tuesday they learned of
the Soviet ban on direct flights during Secretary of State James A.
Baker III's talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Moscow in early February.
   Asked why the Soviets began negotiations on direct flights to
Israel in the first place, Perfiliev told reporters: ``It is
difficult for me to answer questions that should be answered by the
representative of Aeroflot. Many Soviet organizations have an
independent character for their international relations.''
   He hinted that recent developments soured the Soviets on the
deal.
   ``The issue of mass resettlement in the occupied territories was
raised ... quite recently,'' the spokesman said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir caused widespread concern
last month when he suggested Israel needs to keep the West Bank and
Gaza to handle the influx of Soviet Jews.
   The continued ban on direct flights will hinder Soviet efforts
to transport the emigrants, who are leaving in record numbers under
relaxed rules.
   Last year a record 60,000 Jews left the Soviet Union, and the
high rate of departure has continued in 1990.
   Only about 200 out of the 12,000 Soviet Jews who went to Israel
last year decided to settle in the occupied lands, according to
Israeli figures.
   The top political adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat said any
settlement of Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied territories would
be an ``act of war'' that would require reprisals.
   Bassam Abu Sharif told reporters on Wednesday at the PLO
headquarters in Tunis, ``This is very dangerous. We will continue
to work in favor of peace, but if no concrete measure is taken by
the big powers, we must think of means allowing us to defend our
land.''

<HEAD>Testimony: Top Commanders Beat Arabs In Violation Of Orders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Israeli army officer said in military
court today troops often ignored orders barring the beating of
Palestinian detainees and that he once slapped an Arab whose hands
and feet were bound, Israel radio reported.
   Lt. Col. Ephraim Fein, former commander of the elite Givati
Brigade, testified in the trial of four Givati reserve soldiers
accused of brutally beating two Palestinian detainees in the
occupied Gaza Strip in February 1988. One detainee later died.
   During today's hearing, a defense attorney also cited previous
testimony saying that Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, then army chief in
the Gaza Strip, beat a Palestinian who refused orders to clear a
stone roadblock. Mordechai is now head of the army's Central
Command, which includes the occupied West Bank.
   The testimony came a day after the release of a U.S. State
Department report saying Israeli soldiers often ignored regulations
and that many unjust killings by soldiers went unpunished.
   Also today, six Palestinian teen-agers were wounded by army
gunfire in scattered clashes in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said. The army said it was checking the reports.
   The army declared curfews in villages across the West Bank to
prevent violence on the 21st anniversary of the founding of the
Democratic Front of the Liberation of Palestine, a Syrian-backed
radical PLO faction, Israel radio reported.
   The Givati trial revived debate in Israel over the army's
beating policy. Beatings became widespread after Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in January 1988 authorized soldiers to beat
Palestinians during violent demonstrations.
   The four defendants allegedly beat Palestinians severely in a
grove in Gaza's Bureij refugee camp. One of the men, Iyad Akal, 21,
fell unconscious and later died in Gaza hospital.
   Fein, who testified for the prosecution, told the court that at
the time his soldiers were ``in a situation close to war.... The
orders were changed and eroded to keep up with the fast pace of
events.''
   Fein also recalled an incident in which he himself violated
orders.
   ``When they (soldiers) arrested an Arab, they bound his hands
and feet and blindfolded him. One soldier helped him get down from
the jeep, and he spit at the soldier. I slapped the Arab in an
instinctive reaction,'' the radio quoted Fein as saying.

<HEAD>Baker Cautious About Normalizing Relations With Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today
set stiffer conditions for normalizing relations with Nicaragua if
the leftist Sandinistas win Sunday's elections.
   Baker told the House Foreign Affairs committee that the Bush
administration will not automatically accept the judgments of
international observers as to whether the elections are free and
fair.
   If that condition is met, he said, there will be no
normalization until ``we see a substantial period of good
behavior'' by the government, including a halt to support for
leftist rebels in neighboring El Salvador and political freedom for
the opposition in Nicaragua.
   ``It seems to me that if you believe in democracy, you believe
in respecting the results of a free and fair election,'' Baker said
in response to a question from Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.
   ``But the United States must reserve the right to make the
judgment whether the election is free and fair,'' he added.
   Observer groups like one sent by the United Nations and one led
by former President Carter will assess the elections in good faith
and ``arrive at reasoned judgments,'' he said. ``But in light of
experience, the United States needs to make its own judgment.''
   He reminded the panel that a large delegation of congressional
observers that had been appointed by President Bush was denied
visas. At the time, the Nicaraguan government argued that any
official U.S. group could not be objective, since the United States
is providing money to the election campaign of opposition coalition
candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   Some of the members of that group are traveling to Nicaragua
this weekend as members of other observer teams.
   If Sandinista President Daniel Ortega is re-elected _ ``and we
shouldn't assume this,'' Baker said _ ``Before we talk about
normalizing relations ... we must see a sustained period of good
behavior'' by the government.
   ``The government of the United States must be satisfied that
there will continue to be open political space in Nicaragua,'' he
said. ``Then we can consider beginning to look at how we might
normalize'' relations, including lifting trade sanctions.

   Former President Reagan testified in a
videotaped deposition released today that he ``never ... had any
inkling'' that White House aides were secretly helping arm and
advise the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when Congress had banned
such aid.
   And he said, ``No one has proven to me'' that profits from
secret arms sales to Iran were diverted to the rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   Reagan testified as a defense witness in the forthcoming
Iran-Contra trial of former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter. U.S. District Judge Harold Greene allowed the former
president to give a videotaped deposition in Los Angeles last
Friday and Saturday but barred reporters from attending.
   A transcript of that testimony was released today after Bush
administration officials said it did not pose any national security
problems.
   Reagan said he ``assured everybody that we would have to abide
by the law'' during the congressional ban on Contra aid.
   Asked if he had any idea that a Poindexter aide, Oliver North,
was giving the Contras military advice and logistical support,
Reagan said:
   ``I guess that I had never ... had any inkling that we were
guiding their strategy in any way.''
   That statement came under cross-examination by Iran-Contra
prosecutor Dan Webb.
   Poindexter is scheduled to go to trial March 5 on charges of
obstructing congressional inquiries into the sale of U.S. arms to
Iran and covert administration support for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Reagan also testified under oath that he never authorized
Poindexter to obstruct congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra
affair or to destroy documents.
   The former president said repeatedly under cross-examination by
Webb that Poindexter never told Reagan that he planned to lie to
Congress or to destroy documents sought by Iran-Contra probers.
   ``At any time, did John Poindexter ever tell you that he had in
fact obstructed or impeded any congressional committee inquiry into
events relating to the Iran-Contra affair?'' Webb asked.
   ``No,'' Reagan replied.
   ``At any time, did he ever tell you that he had actually
destroyed any records or documents related to the Iran-Contra
affair?'' Webb replied.
   ``No,'' the former president said.
   Reagan said he was never told that North had destroyed
Iran-Contra documents, an act for which the former National
Security Council aide was convicted of a felony last year.
   Asked about his dealings with North, Reagan said: ``I didn't
ever have any extensive contact with him. I heard about him a great
deal and reports on him and so forth.''
   Reagan acknowledged that he supported the solicitation of
donations from foreign governments and others who could help
finance the Contra effort.
   Although the law banned direct U.S. military aid to the rebels,
Reagan said, ``there wasn't any restriction on ... informing others
as to how they could help, things of that kind. And that I did
approve.''
   Reagan also testified that ``I wasn't'' aware that money was
being diverted from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   ``I was only aware finally that we got our 12-million-two,''
Reagan said, referring to the money the U.S. government received
for providing weapons to Iran.
   ``May I simply point out that I had no knowledge then or now
that there had been a diversion, and I never used the term,'' the
former president said. ``And all I knew was that there was some
money that came from some place in another account, and that the
appearance was that it might have been part of the negotiated
sale.''
   Webb asked: ``To the extent that there was in fact a diversion
of proceeds, did you in any way approve or authorize that while you
were president of the United States?''
   ``For heaven's sake, no,'' Reagan replied. ``And when I was once
asked about that extra money and said if it was an added sum to the
purchase price, what would I do, I said I would have given it
back.''
   The former president added: ``No one has proven to me that there
was a diversion.''
   ``To this day, all I know is that some sum of money over and
above the $12.2 million purchase price appeared in a Swiss bank
account in which it was said that account had been used on another
occasions (sic) to provide help to the Contras,'' Reagan said.
   ``And to this day, I still with all of the investigations that
have been made, I still have never been given one iota of evidence
as to who collected the price, who delivered the final delivery of
the weapons ... whether there was ever more money in that Swiss
account that had been diverted someplace else.''
   ``I am still waiting to find those things out and have never
found them out,'' Reagan said.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements in connection
with the Iran-Contra affair.
   Specifically, he is accused of covering up from Congress North's
secret assistance to the Contras and knowledge by government
officials of a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter's lawyers sought Reagan's testimony in an attempt to
show that the president approved of his national security adviser's
activities.
   Judge Greene ordered the release of a transcript of Reagan's
eight hours of testimony but barred the news media from making
copies of the videotape for broadcast.
   In his order, Greene rejected arguments by Poindexter and Reagan
for delaying the release of the testimony.
   ``The press and the public were not admitted to the deposition
itself; but in view of the requirement of openness of crimnal
proceedings, this segment of the Poindexter criminal trial should
not be kept secret,'' the judge said. ``The public is entitled to
know now to what the former president testified.''
   On Wednesday, the Justice Department said it would not seek to
delete any portions of the Reagan tapes, indicating they did
contain any sensitive or classified information.
   The government's refusal to allow the disclosure of certain
information led to the dismissal of some major conspiracy charges
against Poindexter and his co-defendants in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Reagan's lawyers on Tuesday urged the court not to give news
organizations copies of the tapes, proposing instead that a
transcript be made available at the end of the trial. Reagan's
lawyers said the public should be allowed to view the tape but not
copy it.
   In a supporting brief, the Justice Department said it ``believes
that access to a former president's testimony should be no greater
than the access to the testimony of other witnesses.''
   Twelve news organizations have petitioned the court for release
of the videotapes as soon as possible. Poindexter's lawyers have
asked Greene to postpone releasing the tape until a jury is picked,
arguing that broadcast of the tape would jeopardize the defendant's
right to a fair trial.

<HEAD>Judiciary Committee Approves Nomination of Clarence Thomas to Be
Judge</HEAD>

   The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved
the nomination of Clarence Thomas, the conservative chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to be a federal appeals
court judge.
   The nomination was approved 12-1 with Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, voting against it. It now goes to the full Senate.
   Some civil rights forces had opposed the nomination because of
Thomas' opposition to affirmative action programs and his other
conservative views. But the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People announced two weeks ago that it would
not stand in the way of confirmation.
   Thomas, one of the most visible blacks in the Republican
administrations of former President Reagan and President George
Bush, was nominated to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the
District of Columbia.
   At his confirmation hearing last week, Thomas said state and
local agencies were primarily to blame for more than 900 cases of
alleged job discrimination lapsing without action.
   Critics from women's and senior citizens groups said the number
of lapsed cases actually ran into the thousands. Metzenbaum said
the responsibility rested with the commission itself.
   ``I was flabbergasted that he did not know that state agencies
are under contract to process state age discrimination claims,''
Metzenbaum said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that he and Thomas
``disagree about certain aspects of civil rights policy'' and that
he is concerned about the commission's failure ``to ensure that age
discrimination claims were investigated within the statute of
limitations.''
   But, Kennedy said, ``a court of appeals judge neither makes
policy nor presides over an administrative agency.'' He added that
Thomas ``has the ability to serve with distinction on the court of
appeals and I support his confirmation.''
   If confirmed, Thomas would take the place of Robert Bork on the
appeals court. Because it is located in the nation's capital, it
frequently is called on to decide major governmental cases and it
has often been a springboard to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Bork resigned after his nomination to the Supreme Court was
rejected by the Senate in the most bitter judicial fight of recent
years.
   Thomas, born in poverty in rural Georgia, is a graduate of Yale
Law School. He worked for Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., both in
Danforth's Senate office and when he was Missouri attorney general.
   Thomas was recommended to the panel at his confirmation hearing
by Danforth and by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Charles Robb, D-Va.

<HEAD>State Record $67 Million Jackpot Shared By Four</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of four lottery tickets
beat 1-in-14 million odds to share a state record $67 million
jackpot, officials said today.
   Each of the winning tickets is worth $16.7 million. The winners
will get a check for about $2.5 million after taxes for 20 years.
   The $67 million jackpot for Wednesday's drawing was the largest
in the state lottery's four-year history, and sparked a
ticket-buying frenzy.
   ``People are buying them up hundreds at a time. We even have our
own little pool going here at the store just in case,'' said Adria
Singleton, assistant manager at the Ramona Village convenience
market in Chino.
   The winning numbers, drawn from a field of 1 to 49 were: 44, 27,
34, 12, 21, 41, and the bonus number, 6.
   The winners won't be known until the tickets are turned in for
validation.
   California's previous top prize was $61.98 million on Oct. 29,
1988. There were three winning tickets for the October 1988 record
jackpot _ two of which were held by groups of people. The jackpot
ranked fourth largest in the nation, trailing a record $115 million
lottery prize in Pennsylvania last year.
   The jackpot grew to $67 million because there hadn't been a
winner in the twice-weekly lotto game since Feb. 7. The prize was
also bolstered by brisk ticket sale, since a percentage of sales is
added to the jackpot.

   Israeli warplanes blasted a guerrilla base in
southern Lebanon today, Israel's third air raid in less than a week
in the same area, the military command said.
   The jets attacked a base near the village of Liba, four miles
east of the port city of Sidon. All targets were hit and the planes
returned safely to base, the army said.
   ``The targets attacked were used as organization points for
assaults against Israel,'' a military statement said.
   It did not give the identity of the base attacked, and the
extent of damage and casualties was not immediately known.
   It was the third Israeli air raid on guerrila targets in Lebanon
since Feb. 16, when Israeli aircraft attacked a position near Sidon
used by the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal group.
   On Feb. 19, Israeli jets bombed a base, also near Sidon,
belonging to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a Marxist PLO faction.

   The Bush administration today challenged
Congress to help American businesses compete in world markets by
passing enacting a law limiting their legal liability for their
products.
   ``If we are serious about addressing our nation's
competitiveness, we must address the excessive burdens placed on
American business by our current liability system,'' said Wendell
Wilkie II, general counsel for the Commerce Department.
   Wilkie's comments came as the Senate Commerce consumer
subcommittee today considered the first nationwide product
liability law, which in past years has failed to win committee
approval.
   Wilkie said a federal law would make the rules for doing
business ``clear, consistent, uniform and predictable'' and reduce
``transaction'' costs related to liability lawsuits involving
potentially dangerous products.
   Transaction costs are attorneys' fees and other court costs
associated with product liability lawsuits.
   A 1988 survey of business administrators by the Conference
Board, an organization of business executives, showed that 40
percent of U.S. businesses said product liability had a ``major''
impact on their operations, added Wilkie.
   But Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Commerce
Committee, armed with a recent report by the General Accounting
Office, disputed Wilkie's claims.
   Hollings said the study by Congress' investigative arm showed
most punitive damages awards are overturned on appeal by businesses
of product liability cases.
   ``This goes to the heart of transaction costs,'' said Hollings.
   The participants in today's hearing skirted the linkage of the
administration's backing of the bill with the debate over blocking
development of new birth control products, including the French
abortion pill.
   A leading consumer advocate contends administration officials,
in arguing for such a law, are citing a government study that
criticizes legislative and regulatory obstacles to U.S. production
of RU486, the so-called abortion pill.
   But David Beckwith, spokesman for Vice President Dan Quayle,
said Wednesday the Council for Competitiveness _ which Quayle heads
_ ``took no position'' on whether existing laws create obstacles to
the production of RU486 in this country.
   President Bush called product liability standards a legislative
priority in his State of the Union address. The administration
contends the current patchwork of state-by-state laws stifles new
product development, harms U.S. competitiveness, encourages
excessive litigation and inflates insurance costs.
   Beckwith said a council member raised the report by the National
Research Council and the Institute of Medicine during a meeting
last week with consumer advocates.
   The report concluded no U.S. manufacturer will enter the market
to produce RU486, the so-called ``abortion pill,'' or other new
birth control products unless liability laws are changed to reduce
the manufacturers' risk of being sued.
   ``The only way the birth control issue came up was in reference
to newspaper articles ... that mention the various regulatory
delays'' discussing publicity about the product liability problem,
said Beckwith.
   However, Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for Consumers' Union,
a national consumer advisory organization, said ``the
administration, which has done everything to prevent the
manufacture of abortion-causing drugs, (is) bemoaning the fact that
liability concerns have stifled manufacturers from producing these
kinds of drugs.''
   ``The proponents of this legislation point to this one study as
some kind of proof that innovation is stifled because of product
liability,'' she said.
   Consumers' Union opposes the bill, contending it creates
unnecessary obstacles to victim compensation.
   ``The justification for this legislation changes as trends
change,'' said Pam Gilbert, legislative director for Public
Citizen, a consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader.
   Another opponent of the legislation, Arthur Bryant, executive
director of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, said, ``The only way
that product development will not be affected by liability concerns
is to pass a law establishing that ... no compensation would be
paid.''
   Administration and business proponents of a uniform federal
product liability law say the current Senate proposal would not
limit damages.
   The bill, introduced by Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., would:
create a uniform standard for imposing punitive damages in product
liability litigation; allow separate legal proceedings to consider
punitive damages from product liability and compensatory damages;
set a two-year statute of limitations on liability claims; and
allow companies to pay damages in proportion to their
responsibility for harm.
   ``We just want to level the playing field,'' said Victor
Schwartz, an attorney and leading lobbyist for businesses that want
to change the liability law. ``No one knows what rules apply to
them and their products.''
   Opponents argue the proposal would give consumers the burden of
determining the proportion of liability for manufacturers,
distributors or wholesalers of goods. And they charge the federal
government would be usurping states' rights to set up their own
product liability systems.
   In fact, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
recently warned that product liability legislation would lead to
federal regulation of the insurance industry.

<HEAD>Greenspan Faces Questions on `Horrendous' January Inflation</HEAD>

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that while he was surprised by certain aspects of January's
sharp jump in consumer prices, he was not worried that inflationary
pressures were accelerating.
   Greenspan, appearing to present the central bank's semi-annual
report to Congress, was questioned at length about his views on
inflation in light of Wednesday's government report that consumer
prices shot up by 1.1 percent in January, the biggest monthly
increase in seven years.
   The January increase translated into an annual rate of 14.1
percent.
   Sen. Don Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, asked
Greenspan whether such a sharp jump in prices would force the Fed
to change its new forecast that consumer prices will rise by
between 4 percent and 4.5 percent this year, slightly lower than
last year's 4.6 percent increase.
   Greenspan said that he felt comfortable with the Fed's forecast
although he conceded that some of the specific components of the
January price surge were surprising.
   ``As best as we can judge, while the rate of inflation is higher
than we would like, there is no evidence that it is accelerating,''
Greenspan said. ``While I did not like the statistic published
(Wednesday), it did not give me any great concern,'' Greenspan said.
   In his prepared testimony, Greenspan repeated comments he made
on Tuesday that he believed a reversal in the sharp January jump in
prices was under way. He cited evidence showing that price
increases in the last half of 1989 were ``appreciably lower'' than
in the first six months of the year.
   In his testimony today, Greenspan said the Fed expects the
economy to be sluggish this year, growing at an anemic rate of 1.75
percent to 2 percent. That would be the weakest performance since
1984 and far below the administration's expectations for the year.
   Economists believe the slow growth is part of the central bank's
plan to wring inflationary pressures out of the economy. For this
reason, they believe the central bank will not move to lower
interest rates anytime soon, preferring to keep rates high to
discourage borrowing and thus dampen economic demand.
   While the January price increases were indeed frightening to
economists, some viewed the increase as a temporary weather-related
phenomenon. Others saw more entrenched inflationary pressures.
   Prices at the wholesale level shot up 1.8 percent last month, a
pace which translates into an annual rate of 24.1 percent.
   Consumer inflation did little better, rising 1.1 percent in
January, the steepest one-month gain since June of 1982, the
government reported Wednesday.
   Much of the gain in both price measures was attributed to a
spurt in energy and food costs brought on by the severe December
weather which depleted fuel stocks and damaged fresh fruits and
vegetables.
   But even discounting the volatile food and energy categories,
the so-called core rate of inflation climbed at an alarming 0.6
percent in January. That was highest increase in a year and one
which would translate into an annual rate of 7.5 percent.
   The core rate of inflation is considered a better gauge of
underlying inflation pressures. January's 0.6 percent increase was
worrisome enough to attract attention at the White House, which
termed the increase ``disappointing news.''
   ``We do expect the core rate of inflation to decline steadily
over the year,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement. ``We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be
temporary in nature, but inflation requires eternal vigilance and
we remain on a policy of wanting steady growth with low inflation.''
   Fitzwater, who recently criticized the Fed for its refusal to
lower interest rates, refused to say what course the Fed should
pursue now, saying, ``I'll let the Fed worry about interest rates.''
   Some analysts agreed with the Bush administration's assessment
that inflation should ease in coming months and cautioned the Fed
against overreacting to one month's numbers.
   ``The surge in prices should not be viewed as an acceleration in
the underlying rate of inflation, but rather as a one-time increase
in ... food and energy,'' said Gordon Richards, chief economist of
the National Association of Manufacturers.
   But other economists said they were worried that labor costs,
especially in the booming service sector, were beginning to move
upward.
   ``Inflation is disturbingly high,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co. ``This indicates an entrenched
inflation that will not easily recede.''
   John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services, said
it was difficult to discount the January increase because so many
service categories from medical care to entertainment costs were up.
   ``One could try to explain it as a temporary blip but there were
a lot of increases outside of food and energy,'' he said.
``Greenspan says inflation is a concern and he is right.''

<HEAD>Tornado Hits Georgia; High Winds and Rain Across Alabama</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CBS1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A violent storm front packing tornado-like winds and at least
one confirmed tornado racked parts of Georgia and Alabama this
morning, flipping trailer homes and downing trees and power lines
and critically injuring three people.
   Initial damage reports from Columbus, Ga., where the tornado
touchdown was confirmed, were sketchy. In Alabama, authorities
reported serious damage and injuries near Opp, which was hit by
tornado-like winds shortly before dawn, and to the northeast in
Pike County,.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a radio reporter with
station WOPP in Opp, a town of 7,000 about 60 miles north of the
Gulf of Mexico.
   The storm hit the town at about 5:50 a.m., knocking out power
and covering streets with the mangled remains of trees. Witnesses
said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some
neighborhoods showed widespread damage.
   At least 15 injures were reported in Alabama. Six people
required hospitalization, including three who were critically
injured in Pike County when a twister or tornado-force winds
demolished trailer homes. The entire state remained under a flash
flood watch.
   The storm system coursed into Georgia from the southwest,
sending a tornado spinning into Columbus at about 9:15 a.m.
   ``We have no severe damage that we know about,'' said Joy
Burnham, the city's emergency management director. She said some
damage was reported at a car dealership, and some roofs and trees
were blown down.
   Phone lines were down in the downtown Columbus area, according
to Southern Bell spokeswoman Lynne Bress. Georgia Power Co.
spokeswoman Meg Reggie said only a few hundred customers were
without power.
   It was the second tornado in downtown Columbus this month. On
Feb. 10, the city was hit by one of several twisters that touched
down in Georgia during a storm.
   In northern Georgia, where 10 inches or more of rain fell on
some sections last week, the National Weather Service predicted up
to 2 inches of rain today as the storms moved through.
   ``Everybody up here's praying for good things to happen,'' said
Trion Mayor Hoyt Williams, whose town was one of the worst hit by
the earlier rain. ``I don't know what protective measures to take.
Do you?''
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris has asked for $15.7 million in
federal disaster aid for nine counties _ Carroll, Chattooga, Cobb,
Douglas, Fannin, Gilmer, Gordon, Murray and Walker _ because of
recent floods and tornadoes.
   A flash flood watch issued by the National Weather Service for
today covered an area that included Atlanta, Athens and Rome.
   Harris estimated Monday that storms since Feb. 10 have killed
six people and injured 32 in the state. He said 39 homes were
destroyed, while 470 houses and 129 businesses were damaged.
   In Alabama, the most severe damage today appeared to follow a
northeast path from Opp through Pike County into Barbour County. In
Pike County, officials said four people were injured in mobile
homes and a pickup truck was blown into a tree; in Barbour County,
sheriff's deputy R.H. Johnson said four house trailers were damaged.
   Trees and power lines also were snapped off in Chambers, Lee,
Tallapoosa, Bullock and Houston counties, and the wind was clocked
at 76 mph in Dothan.
   An elementary school in Auburn was closed after high winds sent
two trees crashing into the building. No injuries were reported. A
middle school at Auburn also was closed by a power outage.

   Wondering where that hubcap disappeared to?
You might want to start with George Huskins.
   Huskins, 58, collects all those shiny wheel covers that fall by
the roadside. He's got 41,000 in more than 3,100 styles, from
tri-spoke caps for a Studebaker to the Checker Cabs and Indiana
State Police varieties.
   Huskins, who has been hub-hunting for four years, estimates that
7,000 types have been manufactured since the first automobile
rolled off an assembly line.
   Today's versions are usually made of plastic to cut costs, and
they tend to fall off, he said.
   ``They make them a lot cheaper now, especially the after-market
(replacement) caps,'' Huskins said.
   Huskins regularly ships hubcaps across the United States and
Canada and handles orders from overseas.
   His collection includes many hubcaps from the past _ Dort,
Whippet, Flash, Rio, Durant Edsel, Avanti _ and besides being a
novelty, some are worth their weight.
   His most expensive hubcap is a $300 Auburn 12, from the
limited-run cars manufactured in Auburn during the early part of
the century. A spoked cap that was mounted over a spare tire on the
back of a 1934 Ford sells for $200.

cash prizes Thursday in a Cat Day Festival.
   The judges considered the distinctive characteristics of 120
cats in selecting the winner of the fourth annual festival for
finding Japan's top cat.
   The top prize of 100,000 yen (about $694) went to Tsurutaro, a
6-year-old mixed breed Japanese cat, for the high number of split
hairs in its mustache and its ``lovely'' relationship with its
owner, Chizuru Yamamoto, 25.
   Bank clerk Mika Toyokawa, 23, took home the 30,000-yen (about
$208) runner-up prize for a mixed breed Japanese cat named Marina,
who ``always informs me with a `fu-fu' sound when a molester of
women approaches the window.''
   About 350 spectators attended the contest, which is held on Feb.
22 because the Japanese pronunciation of 2-22 _ ``ni-ni-ni'' _
sounds like the word the Japanese use to represent a cat's meow,
``nyan-nyan-nyan.''
   An estimated 4 percent to 5 percent of Japanese households own
cats, whose numbers total about 2.7 million.

<HEAD>University Authorities Ban Students' Demonstrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Nairobi has banned
further demonstrations by students demanding an impartial
investigation into the shooting death of Kenya's foreign minister.
   Philip Mbithi, the vice chancellor, said Wednesday the ban was
imposed because non-students had joined a demonstration earlier in
the day and pelted a presidential monument with stones in a
downtown Nairobi park.
   ``This reflects badly on the image of the institution,'' Mbithi
said.
   Riot police dispersed students for the first time in four days
Wednesday. The clash followed the students' call for President
Daniel arap Moi's resignation and the stoning of the monument,
which was built last year to commemorate Moi's 10th year of rule
   Robert Ouko's partially burned body was discovered Feb. 9 in
brushland about four miles from his family farm near Lake Victoria
in western Kenya. Investigators say he had been shot once in the
head.
   Students began demonstrating in Nairobi on Sunday. Other
demonstrations occured at Egerton University, 90 miles west of
Nairobi, and at Moi University, 155 miles northwest of Nairobi.
   Ouko was the fourth leading political figure to die violently
since Kenya gained independence in 1963. None of the three previous
murders was solved and in each case the government of former
President Jomo Kenyatta was accused of a coverup.
   Moi's government has released only sketchy details of its
investigation, and has called in three Scotland Yard detectives and
a British pathologist to assist it. They began work Wednesday.
   Ouko, a father of four girls and three boys, first served as
permanent secretary in the foreign ministry from 1963 to 1964. He
later held high-ranking government jobs before Moi tapped him to
head the foreign ministry in 1979.

<HEAD>Party Leadership Warns Against `Chaos' This Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leadership joined Soviet
lawmakers Thursday in calling for order this weekend, when mass
rallies are scheduled nationwide, and it urged citizens to oppose
attempts to create ``chaos.''
   The appeal to ``the Soviet working people'' from the party's
policy-making Central Committee showed the Kremlin's clear worry
about the turn that might be taken by Sunday's protests, many of
which are intended to voice the demands of ethnic groups or
denounce more than 70 years of Communist Party rule.
   The Central Committee called on Communists and non-party members
alike to ``rebuff all who push people to chaos, provoke conflicts,
ethnic strife and enmity and create instability in society.'' The
appeal was carried by the official Tass news agency and was to be
printed in Soviet newspapers Friday.
   It follows Tuesday's decree by the Soviet legislature calling on
local authorities to crack down on illegal protests Sunday and to
control those demonstrations that were permitted.
   Rallies by various political groups are scheduled Sunday in
Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk and other major cities. On Friday,
officially Soviet Army Day, anti-military protests are planned in
Moscow, the Ukrainian cities of Lvov and Donetsk, and the Moldavian
capital of Kishinev, organizers said.
   The Communist leadership acknowledged there were grounds for
Soviets to be dissatisfied. ``It is understandable that people are
indignant when they encounter facts of mismanagement, incompetence,
irresponsibility and abuses,'' it said. But it said President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms were the answer and must be
supported.
   ``We cannot and should not reconcile ourselves to the
anti-democratic and unlawful actions taken by all kinds of
demagogues and politicoes,'' the party body said. ``They stir up
national enmity, use brute pressure and intimidation, attempt to
demoralize party and government agencies and their workers and
generate enmity and bitterness, anxiety and non-confidence.''
   ``These are inadmissible and intolerable actions,'' the Central
Committee said. It called for national unity behind Gorbachev's
program of ``perestroika,'' or social and economic reconstruction.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assembled
his 10-point plan and other reunification hits in a long-playing
record album and cassette tape offered free to the first 100,000
East German fans.
   The political hit parade takes listeners back to the
chancellor's now famous speech to parliament Nov. 28, when he laid
out the steps to unity.
   ``What This Historic Hour Has Made Possible,'' the chancellor's
debut album, also contains speeches during his visit to Dresden on
Dec. 19 and at the Brandenburg Gate on Dec. 22, when a stretch of
the Berlin Wall was knocked out to join the two sides of the
divided city.
   The albums and cassettes produced by the federal government are
available while the supply of 100,000 lasts, free to East Germans.
They were made at a cost of $90,000 to West German taxpayers.
   On the bright blue record jacket, Kohl beams and waves over the
roof of his Mercedes to well-wishers in Dresden during his Dec. 19
visit.
   According to Wolfgang Bergsdorf, head of the domestic department
of the federal Press and Information Office, the album of Kohl
speeches being distributed during East German election campaign
rallies ``is already a historical document.''

   Fire swept through a house in western
Pennsylvania today and killed a couple and two of their children,
hours after a vacant tavern building caught fire, authorities said.
   Glen Campbell Fire Chief Dave Lucas said state police suspect
both fires were arson. The tavern caught fire about 2 a.m. and the
house, some 200 yards away, began burning about four hours later.
   Deputy Coronor Mike Baker identified the victims as Earl and
Charmaine Marsh and two Baker children, Wanda and Ralph. He did not
have their ages. Their bodies were found on the second floor,
authorities said.
   Joe Recesky said he was staying at the home of mother-in-law,
near the site of the fires, when a young man came to the door and
asked for help. Recesky said he pounded on the house's windows,
shouted and entered the first floor.
   ``I got in before the flames and smoke drove me from the first
floor,'' he said. ``A can of gasoline must have exploded because my
hair was singed and I was forced out.''
   Lucas said there was evidence of a break-in at the tavern.
   Police arrested a youth at the scene and charged him with
disorderly conduct and underage drinking. Police would not identify
the youth.

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON AP) _ The Energy Department today awarded a $1
billion engineering and construction contract for a a high-powered
atom smasher to a team led by a New York firm, according to members
of Congress.
   The contract was awarded to a consortium of three companies led
by Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas Inc. of New York City.
Also on the team are CRSS Inc. of Houston and Morrison Knudsen
Corp. of Boise, Idaho, officials said.
   Officials say the award is the largest single contract involved
in building the superconducting super collider, a 53-mile
underground ring where scientists would test theories about the
building blocks of the universe by smashing atomic particles at
high speeds.
   The team was chosen from three finalists selected in December
out of a field of 14 to compete for the contract to build the atom
smasher at a site south of Dallas in Ellis County.
   Terms of the contract must still be negotiated, officials said.
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Ennis, whose district includes the site for
the facility, said the contract is a sign the project is moving
forward, despite an anticipated billion-dollar increase in cost and
questions about the technology.
   Larry Neal, a spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, Parsons
Brinckerhoff is the lead contractor and would do the architectural
and engineering contracting work, with Knudsen and CRSS doing the
construction work.
   Congress has appropriated $225 million for the collider,
including $160 million for construction work, during this fiscal
year. President Bush is seeking an additional $318 million for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Because of design changes, the cost of the project is expected
to increase from $5.9 billion to at least $7 billion.
   The collider would be the world's largest scientific instrument.

<HEAD>The Soviet Union Suggests Overall Ceiling in Central Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union suggested today that
NATO and the Warsaw Pact limit their number of troops in central
Europe to 750,000 each, an East German negotiator said.
   The superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 troops each
for the United States and Soviet Union in central Europe.
   The agreement, reached at meetings among NATO and Wasaw Pact
foreign ministers in Ottawa, Canada, is to be part of a final
accord on reducing troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclar
arms in Europe. Negotiators hope to reach agreement on the accord
before the end of this year.
   The new proposal, combined with East bloc nations' plans to cut
their own armed forces, would lead to NATO having more manpower in
the region than the Warsaw Pact, said East Germany's chief delegate
at arms talks, Klaus-Dieter Ernst.
   Ernst said the seven Warsaw Pact countries would have a total
troop strength in central Europe of 600,000 to 700,000 troops,
while the West would have a total of some 1 million troops.
   ``That situation is totally unsatisfactory,'' Ernst said.
   Western sources appeared to contest Ernst's estimate, saying
NATO currently has about 900,000 troops in central Europe, which
covers West Germany, East Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Denmark.
   In the wake of democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and their
growing independence from Moscow, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have
begun negotiations with the Kremlin on a total withdrawal of Soviet
troops from their territories. Those talks are separate from the
ongoing Vienna talks.
   The Soviet idea was presented at the last Vienna plenary before
a three-week recess, but it was not put on the table as a formal
proposal.
   Ernst said that the overall ceiling suggested by the Soviets
would include domestic troops as well as those stationed on foreign
soil.
   In separate negotiations, the Hungarians are seeking withdrawal
of the approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed on their
territory, while Czechoslovakia seeks the total removal of 73,500
Soviet troops from its soil.
   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have also announced troop
cuts of their own.
   Both East and West also presented new proposals in an effort to
narrow differences on definitions of certain armaments and treaty
language for verification of any troop withdrawals.
   West Germany's chief delegate, Ruediger Hartmann, presented two
working papers on behalf of NATO on information exchanges and
conditions for inspections as part of a verification program.
   Ernst said he presented on behalf of the Warsaw Pact a paper on
tank definitions.
   Definitions of weapons categories have been a major sticking
point at the negotiations, which began last March. The sides also
disagree on the number of combat aircrat each side should have.
   ``Lots of work remains to be done here,'' U.S. chief delegate,
R. James Woolsey told reporters.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel started his
New York visit today with breakfast at the mayor's mansion where
the former dissident playwright was joined by a number of U.S.
writers.
   The breakfast with Mayor David Dinkins was the first item on a
busy schedule that included lunch with human rights advocates, a
stop at an art museum and meetings with the Council on Foreign
Relations, Czechoslovak-Americans and U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   Havel, a former jailed dissident who was elected Czechoslovak
president Dec. 29, arrived in the United States on Monday. He spoke
to a joint meeting of the House and the Senate on Wednesday and met
with President Bush twice.
   Havel's wife, Olga Havlova, did not attend today's breakfast.
Havel said she was tired from their travels. Guests at the
breakfast included writers Kurt Vonnegut, Edward Albee and Arthur
Miller.
   Havel said as a playwright, he never could have conceived a plot
in which he would become president.
   ``It is extremely strange and extraordinary,'' he said. ``But I
don't have time to think about it. It is a busy job to be
president.''
   After breakfast, producer Joseph Papp presented Havel with a
collage and said he would produce the Czechoslovak president's
play, ``Slum Clearance.''
   Dinkins gave Havel a crystal apple, and Kitty Carlisle Hart,
chairwoman of the State Council of the Arts and a former actress,
gave him a copy of ``Act One,'' the autobiography of her late
husband, playwright Moss Hart.
   Havel said he was ``extremely happy to be once more in New
York.'' He was last in New York in 1968 for the first night of one
of his plays.
   Asked to compare his ascent to office and Dinkins' campaign to
become the city's first black mayor, Havel said: ``One difference:
I didn't want to be a president. But I was raised to the post by
public pressure. I didn't want it, personally.''
   The Czechoslovak Parliament elected Havel president a few weeks
after a peaceful revolution that led to the ouster of a hard-line
Communist government. Havel's caretaker government is preparing for
parliamentary elections in June.
   Havel's next stop was the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was
greeted on the museum steps by two dozen flag-waving, cheering
youngsters from the Czechoslovak School for children of
Czechoslovakian diplomats.
   ``They've looked forward to this for months and months,''
teacher Lida Husek said. ``For us the changes in our country are
very exciting. But we're so far from home. This is our way of
keeping in touch, with him and with our countrymen.''
   He then traveled to Cardinal John O'Connor's residence where he
received a crystal star from the president of the Appeal of
Conscience Foundation, Rabbi Arthur Schneier.
   On Wednesday, Havel told Congress that the United States could
best help his country by pressing the Soviet Union to stay on its
own road to democracy. Havel was the first of the new East European
leaders to address Congress.
   Speaking through a translator, Havel called Czechoslovakia one
of Eastern Europe's ``wayward children'' and said it wants to
coordinate its return to the economic and political mainstream with
Hungary, Poland and other nations emerging from 40 years of Soviet
domination.

   AFL-CIO leaders today urged unions to
renew support for striking machinists at Eastern Airlines and
declared that the nearly year-long strike ``remains as solid as
ever.''
   Leaders of the 14.1 million-member federation, set to adjourn
their winter meeting later in the day, issued a statement saying
the 8,500 machinists had inspired workers nationwide by being ``on
the front lines of labor's battle against corporate greed and
intransigence.''
   Machinists who walked out last March have faced stiff odds with
a Bush administration that doesn't ``care about the survival of
Eastern Airlines'' and has sided with management in the matter, the
federation said.
   Eastern was the only major point of contention when union
leaders met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole earlier in the week.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland has conceded that so far the
strike has failed, but said Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., has
not won either.
   Labor leaders also acknowledged they still lack enough votes in
Congress to override President Bush's veto of legislation that
would create a commission to settle the dispute.
   The Eastern situation has been a sore spot for labor leaders
this week who otherwise have been buoyed by signs that organized
labor may be recovering from a bleak decade.
   The machinists' strike marks a strong contrast to labor's recent
successes by Pittston coal miners and Nynex telephone workers in
the Northeast.
   Just today, the federation's Executive Council received a report
by the Roper Organization showing that more Americans instinctively
side with unions than with companies in labor disputes.
   ``We've been tempered, I think, by a period of fire and, in the
net result, it's strengthened us,'' Kirkland said.
   The pollsters found, in their most recent tracking surveys, that
33 percent instinctively side with the union while 25 percent favor
the company when they first hear of a strike and before they know
any of the details.
   That was the highest level of support for unions, and the lowest
for companies, recorded by the company since it posed the question
to sample groups 12 years ago.
   Roper reports are sponsored by the AFL-CIO and 40 other
organizations, including government agencies. The company conducts
face-to-face interviews with new groups of 2,000 adults every five
weeks.
   Union leaders were cheered by the results, given the decline in
stature organized labor suffered in the 1980s with losses in
membership.
   Also serving as a rallying point for labor leaders this week was
the success of the Appalachian coal strike _ Pittston miners who
won on key bargaining points ended their bitter 10-month strike
Tuesday by ratifying a new contract.
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka, who last year
brought his union back into the AFL-CIO, and others said the public
looks more favorably on unions because unions have avoided
``focusing so narrowly on shop floor issues.''
   ``There are 38 million Americans without health care. What's the
only group that's really fighting for health care? That's organized
labor,'' Trumka said.
   The Roper report showed that in 1981, 60 percent of Americans
thought unreasonable demands by labor unions made the cost of
living go up unneccesarily. That number has now dropped to 40
percent, the survey showed.
   Noting the decline of blue-collar jobs in the manufacturing
area, the report said the image of unions had gained in the eyes of
professional and white collar workers _ groups that formerly were
the least likely to support organized labor.
   AFL-CIO leaders, who have traditionally taken a hardline
approach to the Soviet Union, called on the Bush administration
Wednesday to give the country most favored nation status, which
would let them benefit from lower trade tariffs.

<HEAD>Iranian Paper Close to Rafsanjani Says Hostages Should be Freed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper close to President
Hashemi Rafsanjani said Thursday all 18 Western hostages in Lebanon
should be freed because they have become a propaganda tool for
Iran's enemies.
   Most of the captives are believed held by kidnappers loyal to
Iran.
   ``Regardless of the West's propaganda ploys, Moslem forces, out
of Islamic and humanitarian considerations, should work to get the
hostages free with no precondition,'' the English-language Tehran
Times said in an editorial, parts of which were carried by Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   It was the first known statement by an Iranian newspaper in
support of freeing all the hostages, whose fate is believed linked
to a power struggle within the Iranian government.
   Eight Americans, four Britons, an Irishman, an Italian, two West
Germans and two Swiss citizens are captives in Lebanon.
   Terry A. Anderson, 42, has been held the longest. He is chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press and was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, was in Damascus, Syria, on
Thursday as part of a tour with an Associated Press delegation to
seek the hostages' release.
   Among leaders with whom she has met are Javier Perez de Cuellar,
the U.N. secretary-general; Pope John Paul II, and Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Attempts to see
Iranian leaders have failed.
   Asked in Damascus about the Tehran Times editorial, Mrs. Say
said: ``I am deeply grateful. It is encouraging. I consider that
Iran is not part of the problem, but part of the solution.''
   Arafat told Mrs. Say in their meeting last week that Rafsanjani
had the greatest influence with the kidnappers, but hard-liners in
the Iranian government limited his room for maneuver.
   In its editorial, the Tehran Times said the struggle against
Western influence in the Middle East was legitimate and should
continue, but that all forces in Lebanon should work to free
hostages of whatever nationality.
   ``They should regard the hostages as victims of imperialist
policies of the West and make attempts to get them all freed,'' it
said. ``Maybe 1990 will be the year for the release of all the
hostages.''
   It repeated Rafsanjani's demand for the release of Iran's charge
d'affaires in Beirut, Mohsen Musavi, and three other embassy staff
members kidnapped in north Lebanon in July 1982 by members of the
Lebanese Forces, a Christian militia. All four are believed dead.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea said in August 1988 he
found no trace of the men after taking over the militia in 1986.
Geagea blamed his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, for their
disappearance and apparent murder.
   Rafsanjani has offered to help free the Western hostages.
   In August 1989, he said there were ``reasonable, prudent
solutions'' to the problem. Two months later, Rafsanjani said he
would not try to get them released unless the United States freed
billions of dollars in Iranian assets frozen in 1979.
   Any statement with even a hint of conciliation is condemned
promptly by factions in the Iranian government who reject the
reconciliation with the West favored by Rafsanjani.
   Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the former interior minister and
Rafsanjani's main rival, regularly encourages groups holding
hostages in Lebanon. He said in a newspaper interview last month
they have ``a natural right to take hostages to inflict heavy blows
on their enemies.''
   Most of the kidnappers are believed linked to Hezbollah, or
Party of God, a Lebanese fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group
Mohtashemi helped organize in the early 1980s.

   The space agency today postponed
launch of shuttle Atlantis on a secret military mission until at
least Saturday, as doctors treat an astronaut's cold and
forecasters worry about the weather.
   The launch had been scheduled for today until the space agency
decided Wednesday to postpone it after commander John O. Creighton
suddenly developed a sore throat and head congestion. Originally,
the launch was postponed to Friday morning; this morning, Creighton
was described as feeling better but the launch was put off at least
one more day.
   ``The commander is doing a lot better,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone. ``They're going to give him another day. And there's also
the weather.''
   NASA said the launch was delayed for at least 24 hours. That
would put liftoff in the early morning hours of Saturday, although
forecasters say the weather is unlikely to clear until Sunday.
   A statement late this morning said Creighton ``showed some
improvement overnight, but remains under assessment.''
   NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said Creighton was examined by a
NASA flight physician on Wednesday morning and was treated with
antibiotics.
   ``He does not have a fever,'' said the spokesman. ``It could be
an indication of a cold coming on.''
   Even without the astronaut's illness, the chances were uncertain
that Atlantis could have been launched today or Friday. Air Force
experts forecast a 50 percent chance today and an 80 percent chance
Friday of prohibitive clouds, rain and wind.
   Because Atlantis' cargo is a secret spy satellite, NASA has not
announced a precise launch time, saying only that a launch on
Friday would come between midnight and 4 a.m. The countdown is kept
secret until the final nine minutes before the rockets ignite, but
sources, who asked not to be named, said the liftoff will come
about 1 a.m.
   After launch, information about the mission is to be blacked out
until an hour before Atlantis returns to Earth. The mission is
expected to last four days and end with a landing at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
   All five of Atlantis' crew members were found to be healthy
during a routine medical examination on Tuesday.
   It was only the second time a mission had been postponed because
of illness. In 1969, the Apollo 9 mission to orbit the Earth and
test the lunar landing module was delayed three days after the
three crew members got sick.
   The following year, Astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off
the crew of Apollo 13, a moon mission, when doctors learned he had
been exposed to the measles. He was replaced on the crew by back-up
pilot John Swigert, but the launch was not delayed.
   NASA officials said there were no plans to replace Creighton.
   A space shuttle launch postponement at this point in the
countdown costs the Kennedy Space Center about $247,000 in labor
and materials. This figure does not include expenses at other NASA
centers that also support the mission.
   NASA's announcement came about two hours before workers were to
start pumping more than half a million gallons of propellant into
Atlantis' fuel tank. Pumping the fuel would have added $377,000 to
the delay cost.
   According to sources who asked not to be named, Atlantis' cargo
is a 37,300-pound, $500 million spy satellite called AFP-731. It is
said to be capable of taking high-resolution reconnaissance photos
and also eavesdrop on electronic communications around the world.
   Sources said the satellite is to be placed into a high
inclination orbit that will cover more of the Earth than satellites
previously launched by the shuttle. This orbital path will carry it
over most of the Soviet Union, including areas far to the north.
   Atlantis' flight will be 34th space shuttle mission and the
sixth secret military mission.

   An explosion ripped through a
U.S.-flagged petroleum tanker in the Persian Gulf today, leaving
two Americans missing and setting off fires that forced the rest of
the crew to abandon ship, the Navy said.
   A U.S. frigate patrolling nearby rescued 23 crew members from
the sea, and some were injured, said Capt. Ron Wildermuth, chief
spokesman for the Navy's Central Command in Florida. Two of the
injured were airlifted to a hospital in Dubai.
   One of the rescued men said all 25 crewmen on the Surf City, a
Kuwaiti tanker flying the U.S. flag, were Americans, but this was
not immediately confirmed.
   The cause of the explosion was not known. Initial reports
indicated it was an accident, said Wildermuth.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said there were
indications the explosion was ``internal.'' He did not elaborate.
   Crewman Wayne Cohen said the blast occurred about 11:00 a.m.
while crew members were working on a cargo tank on the ship, which
was loaded with millions of gallons of highly volatile products.
   ``It was a huge explosion, the whole ship just blew up,'' said
Cohen, 27, of Boston, who was cut by glass and airlifted to a
hospital in Dubai.
   ``The glass in the bridge blew out. There was some panic and we
all made our way to the lifeboat,'' he said. Cohen said he saw
``nothing but fire and smoke'' as he looked back at the tanker from
the lifeboat.
   The 81,283-ton Surf City carried 17.8 million gallons of naphtha
and 8.9 million gallons of gasoil, industry sources said. U.S. Navy
units and the United Arab Emirates coast guard put out four blazes,
but a fifth continued to burn more than six hours after the blast,
and ships nearby moved away for fear of another explosion.
   ``The ship is half-sunk now, and it might sink totally,'' said a
member of the Dubai coast guard.
   Shipping sources said on condition of anonymity the tanker had
been loaded in Kuwait and was on its way out of the gulf. The ship
was off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, near the Iranian
island of Abu Musa, when the explosion occurred.
   Abu Musa was a stronghold of Iranian Revolutionary Guards and
was used as a base to attack ships at the height of the Iran-Iraq
war. There have been no attacks on shipping in the gulf since Iran
and Iraq signed a cease-fire agreement in August 1988.
   Wildermuth said the USS Simpson was 15 miles away from the Surf
City at the time of the accident and rushed to its aid. The USS
Dewey, a missile destroyer, was also in the vicinity and joined the
rescue operation, along with United Arab Emirates vessels, he said.
   The shipping sources said the Simpson, one of about 10 U.S. Navy
ships in the gulf, was escorting the Surf City at the time of the
accident.
   The Navy said direct escorts of Kuwaiti tankers by American
warships stopped after the cease-fire and that U.S. warships now
monitor American-flagged ships in the gulf from a distance.
   Kuwait put 11 of its tankers under the U.S. flag in 1987 to
receive U.S. Navy protection from Iran, which was concentrating
attacks on Kuwaiti-flagged vessels in retaliation for Kuwaiti aid
to Iraq.
   Kuwait last year reached agreement with the United States to
revert six of the 11 tankers to Kuwaiti registry. Surf City was one
of the five remaining U.S.-flagged tankers expected to revert to
the Kuwaiti flag this month.
   U.S. maritime law requires that all crew members of U.S. flagged
ships be U.S. citizens, but an exception was made at the time of
the reflagging in 1987.
   Cohen said all the crew of the Surf City were Americans. He
identified another crewmen airlifted to the same Dubai hospital as
Earl Washington, a boatswain. No other details on the injured were
immediately available.
   The Central Command in Florida, which oversees the Navy force in
the gulf, said it was told at least one of the ship's crewmen was
``British-Canadian.''

   For Prince Charles, today promised just
another round of royal duties _ speechmaking, receptions, lunch
with President Bush and a black-tie dinner. But it may be the most
exciting day in 10-year-old Christopher Wren's life.
   Christopher and his mother, Sherry, of Chevy Chase, Md., were to
shake hands this afternoon with the 41-year-old heir to the British
throne at the American Institute of Architects, where Charles is
opening an exhibit about the schoolboy's namesake, Sir Christopher
Wren.
   The exhibit contains 120 original drawings, models, paintings,
manuscripts and artifacts from Wren's design and construction of
historic St. Paul's Cathedral in London, where Charles married his
wife, Diana, in 1981.
   When young Christopher learned about the famed 17th century
English architect a few years ago, his parents say, he decided to
become an architect himself. The boy was invited to the AIA
ceremony to meet Charles, an outspoken critic of modern
architecture and an admirer of Wren's classical designs.
   It was unknown whether the boy is a descendant of the St. Paul's
architect.
   Charles, who is on a weeklong visit to the United States, flew
to Washington from Charleston, S.C., where he urged 100 corporate
executives to look beyond short-term profits in making decisions
that might affect the environment.
   The prince, who last visited Washington a year ago, had lunch in
the White House family quarters today with Bush and his top aides,
including Secretary of State James A. Baker III, national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Afterward, Charles returned to the British Embassy in chill,
drizzly weather while Bush presented the AIA's Gold Medal _ its
highest honor _ to architect Fay Jones of Fayetteville, Ark., a
former pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright.
   Charles and Jones will be honored guests tonight at one of the
hottest attractions in town _ a black-tie, $250-a-plate AIA dinner
at the National Building Museum. The 1,200 dinner seats sold out a
month ago, and there are 800 people in the waiting line for tickets.
   The American architects lucky enough to get into the dinner _
along with members of Congress, diplomats and Hollywood celebrities
_ were eagerly awaiting the prince's speech for any rhetorical
fireworks it might contain.
   In the past, Charles has accused contemporary architects of
designing ``Frankenstein monsters'' and said the London skyline has
suffered more damage from architects, city planners and developers
than from German bombers in World War II.
   Before dinner, Charles planned to attend a British Embassy
reception for alumni of the Marshall Scholars program, under which
the British government pays all costs for exceptional American
students to study in British universities for two or three years.
   The prince, who began his U.S. visit by playing in two charity
polo matches last weekend in Florida, will return to Britain on
Friday after meeting with U.S. environmental experts at the embassy.

<HEAD>King Followers Support Mandela But Are Uneasy About `Armed' Stance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights veterans who for decades have
carried the Rev. Martin Luther King's banner of non-violence are
uneasy over Nelson Mandela's refusal to renounce violence but are
reluctant to criticize the South African.
   For colleagues and followers of King, the release of Mandela
this month after 27 years in prison has posed something of a moral
dilemma.
   As longtime opponents of apartheid, they are joyful over
Mandela's freedom. But the refusal by Mandela and the African
National Congress to rule out the use of arms is at odds with the
non-violent philosophy espoused by King.
   Followers of King, however, say they believe the slain civil
rights leader, if alive today, would not condemn Mandela for his
position.
   ``We still subscribe to non-violence. But we don't believe we
have a right to dictate to other people how to achieve their
liberation,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
King-founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   ``While I personally choose other tactics, I grant them the
right to choose how to get the heels off of their necks.''
   David J. Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of King,
said Thursday that supporting Mandela is less of a problem for
King's followers than it would have been for King himself.
   ``There's no getting around the fact that King's belief in
non-violence was so total and central that he could not have
endorsed the tactical position of the ANC,'' said Garrow, an
associate professor of political science at City College of New
York.
   ``But I think the totality of King's commitment to non-violence
was relatively unusual, even within the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference,'' he said. ``I don't necessarily think
there's any contradiction or alteration involved for a lot of
people to say they happily endorse Mandela and the ANC.''
   Those who worked closely with King said they would prefer using
the principles of non-violence preached by King to overcome
apartheid. But they said they can understand, because of the
violence suffered by blacks in South Africa, why Mandela feels he
cannot rule out violence in self-defense.
   ``We had this argument in the early stages of the civil rights
movement,'' said King's widow, Coretta Scott King. ``We worked with
people who told Martin, `If they hit me, I'll hit back.'''
   ``He told them, if they were going to join (the movement),
they'd have to be non-violent,'' Mrs. King said in an interview
last week. ``Many people in the marches were not non-violent but
became non-violent as time went on.''
   Mrs. King said her husband didn't condemn those who disagreed
with him but tried through his own actions to demonstrate the
effectiveness of non-violence.
   Lowery said King unequivocally opposed violence but still was
supportive of the African National Congress before his
assassination in 1968. The association's violence ``posed him a
moral problem and a theological problem,'' Lowery said, ``but I
don't know that he ever condemned the ANC.''
   King frequently spoke out against South Africa's racial
segregation. He advocated worldwide economic sanctions against
South Africa to destroy apartheid.
   In a 1964 speech on South Africa, however, King said, ``We can
understand how in that situation people felt so desperate that they
turned to other methods, such as sabotage.''
   Lowery stressed that Mandela has endorsed only defensive
violence, not aggressive force.
   The Rev. Hosea Williams, a former Atlanta city councilman who
was King's ``field general'' in the peak days of the civil rights
movement, said he disagrees with the use of violence in South
Africa but would not withdraw his support for the anti-apartheid
effort.
   ``Mandela is advocating protective violence, which is much
different from Dr. King's total non-violence advocacy,'' Williams
said. ``We never found anything more effective than non-violence.''
   Williams said the refusal of blacks to resort to violence, even
after the beatings suffered by demonstrators in Alabama in 1965,
drew sympathy from the public and provided support to force federal
civil rights legislation.
   The use of violence by the ANC, Williams suggested, could
jeopardize such popular support for the anti-apartheid movement.
   ``I'd plead with Mr. Mandela to give up on any sort of violence
and resort totally to non-violence. But I certainly could not
withdraw my support for the black struggle in South Africa,''
Williams said.

   A TV movie about the Challenger disaster
has upset and offended those closest to Christa McAuliffe, the New
Hampshire schoolteacher who died in the shuttle explosion.
   Among the critics are McAuliffe's mother, Grace Corrigan, and
Concord Mayor James MacKay, who said the film reduced him to tears.
Mrs. Corrigan and McKay said the movie failed to capture
McAuliffe's personality.
   Mrs. Corrigan, of Framingham, Mass., said at first it was
difficult to watch a screening of ``Challenger,'' which will air
Sunday on ABC.
   ``It started to upset me, then I said, `No, I'm not going to let
it because it is only a video,''' she said in a telephone interview
this week.
   Mrs. Corrigan, whose husband, Edward, died this year and was
buried four years to the day after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger
explosion, said actress Karen Allen failed in her attempt to
portray McAuliffe.
   ``I didn't feel it was Christa, but I didn't think it would
be,'' she said.
   MacKay complained that the movie invaded the McAuliffe family's
privacy, and also said Allen's portrayal of the former teacher ``in
no way caught the depth'' of McAuliffe's personality.
   MacKay said the film conjured up painful images of the
ill-fated, 73-second flight and was difficult for him to watch.
   ``The whole thing was very emotional to me,'' MacKay said. ``I
started to cry at several points.''
   McAuliffe, a Concord High School social studies teacher who was
the first private citizen chosen to fly in space, died with six
other crew members.
   Bob Hohler, a reporter for The Boston Globe and author of ``I
Touch the Future: The Story of Christa McAuliffe,'' said he thought
the movie was ``pretty bad.''
   ``It just was a pretty powerful moment in history reduced to a
dull docudrama. It's real superficial,'' Hohler said. ``It cheapens
history when it becomes so superficial.''
   Writer-producer George Englund said he knew there would be mixed
reactions to the film but defended it as ``sensitive in almost
every aspect.''
   NASA officials said the agency has taken no formal position on
the movie, but two spokesmen said they believe sentiment at NASA
uns against the film.
   ``It's the sort of thing that basically we think is probably too
soon to be done,'' said Hugh Harris, deputy director of public
affairs at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   ``If I were guessing, people who were not involved at NASA will
find it a very touching film, but there will be some people at NASA
who feel it cuts close to the bone,'' said Bill Sheehan, NASA
associate administrator for communication in Washington.
   Englund said any movie about the disaster was bound to cause
debate.
   ``I can understand why some people would think it's too soon,''

   Scores of riot police, some carrying
revolvers, stood guard outside a hospital Thursday to prevent a
rally in memory of people killed in a fledgling pro-democracy
movement.
   The government said 12 people have been killed since Sunday.
   Government spokesman Radhey Shyam Bista said the latest victim
died of injures sutained Tuesday when police fired on rioters in
Jadukuha, 100 miles southeast of Katmandu.
   Opposition sources say the official death toll is far too low
and that nearly twice that many people have died since the Nepali
Congress Party and a left-wing coalition began agitating to end the
29-year-old ban on political parties.
   Most victims have been killed by police gunfire, and some of the
injured, estimated at more than 50, have been brought to Bir
Hospital in the capital, Katmandu.
   Policemen carrying batons, and some with revolvers, blocked
traffic around the hospital Thursday and asked pedestrians to leave
the area, forcing organizers to cancel the memorial rally.
   ``We couldn't hold our program because of the police,'' said a
member of the left-wing coalition contacted by telephone.
   But four small street-corner meetings were held near the
hospital, said the activist, who spoke from an undisclosed location
and refused to be identified.
   Police said they had no information on any meetings being held.
   The government of King Birendra says the campaign to lift the
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum in which
voters narrowly rejected a return to a multiparty system.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with a Western-style democracy ended
in 1961, when King Mahendra, the present monarch's father,
dissolved the government of the Nepali Congress Party, accusing it
of corruption and poor administration.
   The government accuses the opposition parties of trying to
impose their version of democracy on a nation that they say already
has a working democracy.

   Jaime Escalante, the inspiring inner-city
math teacher whose story was told in the 1988 movie ``Stand and
Deliver,'' is threatening to quit.
   He cited a spate of letters from parents saying their children
wanted to drop his advanced mathematics classes, sometimes in favor
of sports.
   The Bolivian-born teacher said Wednesday such requests ``hurt me
more than anything else'' and that parents ``don't see education as
the way to succeed in this country.''
   Escalante, who gained national attention for success in teaching
college-level calculus to Hispanic youths, said he also has
problems with jealous colleagues, anonymous threats and a lack of
school district support.
   Superintendent Leonard Britton said he had ordered an inquiry.
   Escalante, 59, said he may leave Garfield High School as early
as June and seek a teaching job in San Diego, Ventura or San
Francisco. Escalante, an engineer before switching to teaching,
also said he may return to computer design.

   Israel on Thursday awarded Ioanna Tsatsou,
the widow of a former Greek president, the title Righteous of
Nations for helping save the lives of Jews during the Nazi
occupation of Greece.
   An Israeli diplomatic representative in Athens presented the
award to Mrs. Tsatsou, an author and sister of Nobel laureate
George Seferis.
   Of the 65,000 Greek Jews, only 6,500 survived the Holocaust,
mostly through the efforts of Greek Christians who hid them.
   Mrs. Tsatsou's husband, Constantine Tsatsos, was the first

   Miss America Debbye Turner says fame has
its drawbacks, but wearing a crown to fund-raisers, auto shows, pep
rallies and mall appearances generally has been a lot of fun.
   ``It was kind of fun that people would recognize me,'' she told
a crowd of about 400 Wednesday at Southwest Missouri State
University. ``I'd walk in a hotel lobby or down the street and
people would recognize my face and stop me. I couldn't get used to
it.''
   The marimba-playing former Miss Missouri says she also has met
President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Bill Cosby, her idol
Lionel Hampton, Bruce Willis and Janet Jackson, to name just a few.
   The disadvantages are a loss of privacy and the need to live out
of a suitcase, she said.
   Once an airport porter tapped one of her traveling companions on
the shoulder. ``He said, `Excuse me ma'am, was that Miss America
who just went out the door?'' Miss Turner recalled. ``She said
`Yes, how did you know?'
   ``Because she was here a couple of weeks ago and she had those
same shoes on,'' the skycap replied.
   Miss Turner plans to go back to college after her reign ends and
become a veterinarian. She said, ``Then I will no longer be Miss
America, I will be Dr. America.''

   An invitation by David Letterman for
governors to send in half-minute videotapes about their states
hasn't stirred much excitement in Texas.
   Gov. Bill Clements says he has never seen NBC's ``Late Night
with David Letterman'' or its host. ``I haven't and don't intend
to,'' Clements said, adding that he is usually in bed an hour
before the show comes on.
   On Wednesday, Clements said, ``Why not?'' when asked if he would
be interested in sending a tape for Letterman's series of
``Gubernatorial Minutes.'' But on Thursday, Rossanna Salazar, the
governor's press secretary, said Clements probably would not send
in a tape because of his tight schedule and the potential for
biting remarks from comedian Letterman.
   A Letterman staff member told the Houston Post there is no
intention of holding governors or states up to ridicule in exchange
for the free air time.

<HEAD>De Klerk Accepts ANC Proposal on Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk on
Thursday accepted a proposal by the African National Congress to
send a delegation for the first formal talks between the white
government and its foremost adversary.
   The ANC's commitment to dialogue ``is a positive step,''
reflecting a desire to ``search for solutions through peaceful
means,'' said de Klerk, who lifted a 30-year ban on the guerrilla
movement three weeks ago.
   De Klerk also made his first public statement on a controversy
involving Defense Minister Magnus Malan, who has been linked in
press reports to a secret military unit that allegedly assassinated
anti-apartheid activists.
   The president, interviewed by the state-run TV network, said the
allegations would be thoroughly investigated by a judicial
commission, criticized the press for conducting a ``trial by
media,'' and praised the role of the security forces in saving
South Africa from ``anarchy and chaos.''
   Opposition political leaders demanded Malan's resignation and
urged de Klerk to ensure that no cover-up takes place.
   Malan, in statements this week, denied having ordered
assassinations, but did not rule out the possibility the unit may
have committed such acts. He pledged the military would not
interfere with any investigations.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg quoted sources as saying
Malan had been aware of the unit at least since 1987.
   Police investigators have said in court papers that members of
the unit, called the Civil Cooperation Bureau, are suspected of
involvement in the assassinations last year of David Webster, a
Johannesburg human rights activist, and Anton Lubowksi, a civil
rights lawyer and pro-independence activist in Namibia.
   De Klerk last month ordered a judicial inquiry into charges that
military and police squads murdered government opponents. The
commission is expected to investigate the unsolved killings of at
least 60 activists in the past decade.
   Three former policemen have confessed to serving on death
squads. Several active police officers are under investigation.
   The activists allegedly killed by the death squads include
members and supporters of the ANC.
   Although it was legalized Feb. 2 as part of de Klerk's peace
initiative, the ANC says its guerrilla campaign remains one of its
tactics in trying to pressure the government to end white-minority
domination.
   On Feb. 16, the ANC said from its headquarters in Zambia that it
would send a delegation to South Africa to confer with de Klerk
about obstacles in the way of negotiations on a new constitution.
   The ANC says the state of emergency must be lifted and all
political prisoners freed before such talks can start. Its office
in London released a list Thursday of more than 750 prisoners it
said should be freed.
   No date for the preliminary meeting has been set. De Klerk said
the government would first have to address ``legal uncertainties''
regarding exiled ANC leaders who might be liable for prosecution in
South Africa.
   Earlier Thursday, the government said de Klerk had postponed a
meeting scheduled for Saturday in Zaire with leaders of some black
African nations. The ANC had urged a boycott of the meeting, saying
de Klerk's reforms had not gone far enough.
   While welcoming the ANC's decision to pursue talks, de Klerk
said it was ``disappointing that the ANC leadership continues to
talk about an armed struggle and hostilities at a time when most
South Africans, supported by the rest of the world, want peace.''
   The government ``is committed to a new dispensation which offers
peace and justice for all,'' de Klerk said. ``An armed struggle and
hostilities do no fit into this pattern.''
   Recently freed ANC leader Nelson Mandela helped launch the
guerrilla campaign in 1961, a year after the group was outlawed.
The bombing and sabotage campaign has been ineffectual in the past
year and poses little threat to the government.
   In the port city of Durban, leaders of the ANC and a more
conservative rival movement, Inkatha, opened their first
head-to-head peace talks Thursday, seeking to halt a power struggle
that has killed more than 3,000 people.
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu, arriving for the closed-door talks,
said blacks in Natal Province were ``preparing themselves for
peace'' after three years of savage factional warfare.
   Mandela is expected to appeal for reconciliation when he
addresses a mass rally in Durban on Sunday.
   Sisulu, one of Mandela's closest associates, joined an ANC
delegation that met black community leaders from around
Pietermaritzburg, one of the worst-hit areas.
   The group then returned to Durban to meet an Inkatha delegation
headed by Oscar Dhlomo, second-in-command under Zulu politician
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Both groups depict themselves as foes of apartheid, but Inkatha
rejects the ANC's use of violence and opposes confrontational
protest tactics. The ANC favors a socialist-oriented economy, while
Inkatha favors free enterprise.

   The familiar figure of Ronald Reagan flickered
across television screens in a pair of federal courtrooms Thursday
before one of his smallest audiences ever.
   Several dozen reporters _ enough to pack one courtroom at one
point _ watched and listened, took notes, drifted in and out.
   The occasion was the first showing of the former president's
videotaped testimony, taken last weekend and intended for use in
the Iran-Contra trial of his one-time national security adviser,
John Poindexter.
   Reagan testified about Iran and about the Nicaraguan Contras,
about former aides Poindexter and Oliver North, about weapons and
about hostages. But, perhaps most strikingly, he testified over and
over during eight hours of questioning about how much he didn't
remember.
   ``I don't recall that,'' Reagan responded when asked about the
Tower investigative commission's report that North and the National
Security Council were involved in aiding the Nicaraguan rebels.
   When lawyers read him that part of the commission report, Reagan
continued to deny recollection, saying his interest had been in
other findings.
   He was asked about American contacts with Iranian dissidents who
he had hoped were in a position to form a government to succeed the
Ayatollah Khomeini.
   ``I can't recall the dates,'' he said.
   When he was hospitalized for cancer, did government officials
come to Bethesda Naval Hospital to inform him of negotiations?
   ``I recall I had visits at the hospital. I have to tell you, I
can't recall just what they were all about,'' he responded.
   Looking relaxed, Reagan allowed an occasional smile to cross his
lips, and chuckled once when lawyers began arguing about a question.
   Another time he thanked the judge for interceding during
questions about his having quoted Abraham Lincoln. Through a smile,
Reagan remarked that such questions just increase the jokes about
his age.
   But again and again _ indeed 10 times in one 30-minute stretch _
Reagan said he didn't recall events.
   Was he ever told that it would be better to have Israel handle
the delivery of missiles to Iran?
   ``No, I don't recall that.''
   Did he recall being told that private individuals were involved?
   ``No, I don't.''
   Did he know the details of providing spare parts for Hawk
missiles for Iran?
   ``I just don't recall.''
   Had he ever discussed with Poindexter what to say if the story
came out?
   ``I don't recall, I don't recall that.''
   Did he meet with Poindexter between two news conferences in
November 1986.
   ``I don't recall.''
   When he met with congressional leaders, was Poindexter present?
   ``I don't recall.''
   Did he remember when he was informed of the Hawk missile
shipment.
   ``I actually don't. I don't recall when I was told or who told
me.''
   Was that information given to him in Geneva, when he was
preparing for a meeting with Soviet President Gorbachev?
   ``I don't have a clear recollection of what was discussed. There
were so many meetings in so many different places.''
   In the courtroom of Judge Harold Greene, hours of taped
testimony ground on, starting before a packed house that eventually
dwindled to a handful.
   Across the hall a couple dozen reporters drifted in an out of
Judge Louis Oberdorfer's courtroom, where they were allowed to see
excerpts they had requested.

   The Senate today rejected an attempt to cut
off debate on a proposed resolution to commemorate an ``Armenian
genocide,'' a move that signals trouble for supporters of the
measure.
   The resolution, which has infuriated Turkey and caused bitter
divisions among Republican lawmakers, is sponsored by Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. It would designate April 24 as a
``national day of remembrance'' of the ``Armenian genocide of
1915-1923.''
   By a 49-49 vote, the Senate refused to break a filibuster
against Dole's resolution. Dole needed 60 votes to end the debate.
   Over three days, opponents of the measure led by Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., had filibustered the resolution.
   Despite Dole's defeat, the measure is not dead. In fact, Dole
said he would ask for another cloture vote to be held next week.
   Two Republicans took opposite positions on the resolution debate
today.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said there is ``strong evidence''
that Armenians were the victims of a genocide 75 years ago.
``Civilians were sought out and massacred because they were
Armenians,'' he said.
   He said he supports the resolution because the United States
should always stand firm against human rights abuses.
   However, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said the historical facts are not
completely known. Moreover, he said the United States should not
fans instability in Central Europe at a time of great change there.
   The alleged massacre of 1{ million Armenians occurred in the
Ottoman Empire before the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.
Turks contend that at most 600,000 Armenians died and that they
died of disease, famine or attacks by marauding bands during World
War I.
   Sen. John Warner, Rr
   Nuzhet Kandemir, the Turkish ambassador to the United States,
said in a letter to senators that the ``resolution would constitute
an unwarranted and deeply offensive insult'' to his government.
   ``No more serious charges can be levied against a nation,'' he
said.
   After two days of debate on the measure, the Senate scheduled
the cloture vote on whether to cut off discussion. Sixty senators
must vote to invoke cloture. A vote to end the debate would clear
the way for a yes-or-no vote on the resolution.
   Key Democrats have joined the Bush administration in opposing
the Dole resolution, primarily on grounds that it could jeopardize
U.S.-Turkey relations. Turkey, a NATO ally, is home to U.S.
military bases.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., is the leading opponent of the
measure and was joined by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Wednesday in
speaking against the measure.
   Although Armenians suffered in the past, it would be pointless
to create new problems with the resolution, said Nunn, chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate risks making a
decision that could ``weaken the Southern flank of NATO,'' he said.
   The resolution may seen ``remote and academic,'' but it is a
live issue in Turkey, said Nunn.
   Turkey's lobbyists have said that country's government might
retaliate against the United States with drastic steps, possibly
even refusing to renegotiate rights for military bases.
   Several of Nunn's colleagues on the panel joined him in opposing
the measure, including Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., and James Exon, D-Neb. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also condemned the measure.
   Dole has broken with the administration on the resolution,
although President Bush said during the 1988 presidential campaign
that he would be inclined to remember the dead Armenians in a
resolution.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier this
month, ``It has been the position of prior administrations to
oppose those resolutions and let history be the judge of that
unfortunate episode.''
   Dole and White House officials tried earlier to reach a
compromise on the language in the measure, but had little success.
Dole has said, however, he might offer substitute language in the
form of amendments.

   Prime Minister Charles Haughey said
Thursday he would not support European Community membership soon
for the emerging East bloc democracies but foresaw individual
agreements with the former Communist states.
   Haughey, current president of the EC, said signals that the
United States wanted to establish new ties with the 12-nation trade
bloc reflected its emergence as ``very near to superpower rank''
politically and economically and as an ``anchor of stability'' in a
rapidly changing Europe.
   He said the community would make separate association agreements
with the Eastern European nations, with the exception of East
Germany as part of a united Germany.
   ``The agreement with each country would be a semi-permanent
thing,'' he said. ``It would not be something seen as a step toward
membership. I can't see any major expansion of the community for
some time to come, simply on the basis of size.''
   Asked if the Bush administration was more interested in the
community than in the special relationship with Britain, Haughey
said, ``Definitely, quite clearly.''
   ``There is a distinct change of emphasis and, more likely, of
policy,'' he said.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have ``clearly
signaled ... that the United States now wishes to look to the
community for a full, meaningful and across-the-board
relationship,'' he said.
   During a two-day visit to Washington next week, Haughey will
discuss with Bush and Baker how to set up closer U.S.-EC links.
   Bush has urged the community, which is to become a single
barrier-free market in 1992, to accelerate moves toward monetary
union and closer political ties. Baker, in a speech in Berlin in
December, said Washington was seeking a closer, more formally
structured relationship.
   Haughey said an EC-U.S. treaty would take too long to organize.
The West European countries have suggested as a preparatory move
regular meetings between Baker and the EC foreign ministers.
   Haughey's remarks appeared likely to underline what many
commentators and British opposition parties see as Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's increasing isolation and dwindling influence
internationally.
   Key factors are the prospect of a powerful, united Germany, the
apparent waning of the U.S.-British relationship since President
Ronald Reagan left office and Britain's often isolated position in
the community over issues such as the pace of European union and
monetary integration.
   Mrs. Thatcher also is widely regarded as having come grudgingly
to accept rapid German unification. Her government denies this
attitude.
   In the latest confrontation, Britain on Tuesday defied an EC
decision not to ease sanctions against South Africa in response to
the white-run government's reforms and decided to drop the
non-binding ban unilaterally.
   Irish newspapers reported prominently Thursday that U.S.
administration officials denied a claim by Britain that Bush
supports Mrs. Thatcher's policy.
   Ireland, whose bilaterial relations with Britain are colored by
the troubled history of British-run Northern Ireland, accused the
Thatcher administration of setting a ``dangerous precedent.''

   A Coast Guard investigator said today
he cannot explain why the Exxon Valdez disappeared from radar and
then reappeared after is had run aground on Bligh Reef.
   Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Falkenstein confirmed that the Coast Guard had
responsibility for monitoring the tanker during its transit into
Prince William Sound, but also confirmed that the ship was not
visible on radar some time before its disastrous accident.
   Coast Guard monitors have testified that the ship was visible on
the radar after its skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, radioed that it was
aground.
   ``If you are asking why it was off radar, and secondarily was on
radar ... I don't know,'' Falkenstein said under questioning by
Hazelwood attorney Michael Chalos.
   The 43-year-old Hazelwood, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with
second-degree criminal mischief, a felony; and three misdemeanors _
reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and
negligent discharge of oil.
   The officer, who was one of the first on board the ship after it
ran aground, said he smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath and
immediatetly sent word to shore that someone should be sent to test
the captain's blood alcohol level.
   He also testified that federal regulations followed by the Coast
Guard required that a vessel going through the Valdez Narrows into
Prince William Sound must be ``under the direction and control'' of
an officer who has been certified as specially trained for that
area.
   Hazelwood was the only officer on board with such a
certification when the accident occurred, and he was not on the
ship's bridge.
   In testimony Wednesday, an Exxon official said that Hazelwood
indicated the disaster was his fault and he was to blame for the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Paul Myers of Danville, Calif., told jurors Hazelwood appeared
to be taking responsiblity as captain of the ship. But he was
prevented from answering a question about whether Hazelwood also
was accepting criminal blame.
   Hazelwood told him the ship, pride of the Exxon fleet, was
damaged but safe and said there was oil in the waters of Prince
William Sound, Myers recalled.
   ``He indicated this had happened and it was his fault. He was to
blame,'' Myers said. ``He had just gone down to do some paperwork
when this happened and he should have been on the bridge.''
   The tanker leaked nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil
into Prince William Sound. The disaster killed countless birds,
fish and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
Nearly a year later, it still is being cleaned up.
   Exxon officials announced Wednesday that the company will resume
its cleanup of the remaining oil May 1. Exxon suspended its cleanup
in September because of the onset of severe winter weather, but had
declined to set a date for further work.
   The company found serious problems along about 10 of the 90
miles of shoreline its crews surveyed, said Hann Jahns, an Exxon
scientist.
   Earlier in the trial, Hazelwood was quoted as telling a Coast
Guard investigator who asked what the ship's problem was: ``I think
you're looking at it.'' A witness said the anguished skipper was
referring to himself.
   Another Exxon tanker captain on Wednesday told jurors for the
first time that the giant oil company is concerned about the
outcome of Hazelwood's trial. Michael Stalzer said Exxon has paid
for his lawyer and for legal representation of all crew members who
are testifying in the trial.
   ``I believe Exxon does have an interest in the outcome of this
case,'' he said.
   Exxon is the defendant in more than 150 civil lawsuits resulting
from the oil spill. But Hazelwood is the only defendant charged
criminally.
   Stalzer, who preceded Hazelwood as commander of the Exxon Valdez
and replaced him after the accident, indicated that Hazelood
violated several sections of a company operating manual in his
command of the ill-fated ship.
   Stalzer said he would not have left the ship's bridge during a
potentially hazardous passage around ice in Prince William Sound.
Hazelwood left the ship in control of the third mate 10 minutes
before it grounded.
   But he said none of the violations was against the law, and that
the Exxon ``bridge manual'' was merely a guideline and statement of
company policies on how to run a tanker.
   The prosecution seeks to prove that Hazelwood's actions were
reckless and endangered the property and lives of others.
   Stalzer described the Exxon Valdez as the newest and probably

30-ship fleet.
   Starting May 1, Exxon will resume its cleanup of oil remaining

largest oil spill, company officials said Wednesday.
   Exxon suspended its cleanup in September because of the onset of
severe winter weather, but had declined to set a date for further
work.

   Thirty toll-takers at the Triborough Bridge have
been hit with a mysterious illness during the past week, prompting
authorities to study everything from the air they breathe to the
coffee they drink.
   Three workers on Thursday became the latest victims of the
ailment, complaining of sore throats, headaches or dizziness. Other
symptoms that have afflicted workers since the outbreak began Feb.
16 include vomiting, watery eyes and fainting. One worker required
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   Carbon monoxide poisoning was ruled out on Wednesday. On
Thursday, test results showed that tap and bottled water were not
the problem, officials said.
   ``At this point it's still a mystery and we'll just stay with
it. We'll look at everything under the sun until we can get to the
bottom of this,'' said Tina Casey, a spokeswoman for the city
Department of Environmental Protection.
   The Y-shaped bridge spans the East River and connects the New
York City boroughs of Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. It is used
by 160,000 vehicles a day.
   Barbara Richardson, a spokeswoman for the Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority, said Thursday's illnesses marked the first time
the symptoms had struck someone at the Bronx toll plaza; all other
victims had been at the Manhattan plaza.
   It alsowas the first time the incidents occurred in the morning;
the others were in the evening or afternoon, Richardson said.
   A year ago February, two officers were hit by a similar outbreak
at the Bronx toll plaza.
   On Wednesday, devices were installed in each of the self-service
lanes to help detect any airborne contaminants.
   ``In addition to using the air-monitoring equipment, we've also
stationed our hazardous material people during rush hour to see if
we can ever sense anything with our five senses,'' Casey said.
``You might need a sixth sense to solve it.''
   Boilers, incinerators, emissions, eating habits, coffee
purchased en route to work, bacteria levels and drycleaning of
uniforms are being studied.
   Also, Casey said, pesticides and paint stored on Randalls
Island, where the toll plazas converge, are being investigated,
along with a Parks Department garage there. A sewage treatment
plant on adjoining Wards Island has been checked.
   ``So we haven't exhausted all the angles but we have definitely
begun looking beyond the obvious ... no matter how illogical or
obscure,'' Casey said.

<HEAD>Reform Panel Calls For End to State Monopoly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission studying reform of Poland's
radio and television recommends abolishing the state broadcasting
monopoly and abolishing the committee that runs it, the official
news agency PAP reported Thursday.
   The committee, set up by Radio and Television Committee head
Andrzej Drawicz after his appointment by Poland's new
Solidarity-led government, spent fur months studying ways to
reshape the country's two state-run TV channels and four radio
programs.
   The government-controlled broadcast media were used as an
anti-opposition tool of the former Communist government, and the
reforms to assure their independence was one of the most urgent
items on the public agenda after Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
became the first non-Communist to lead an East bloc government last
fall.
   ``The place of our radio and television institution in Poland's
new socio-political system necessitates the adoption a new law on
the radio and TV broadcasting system,'' the committee said.
   The new law, to be drafted by parliament, should dissolve the
Radio and Television Committee and replace it with a national
council, the panel siad.
   One proposal under consideration would establish a nine-member
supervisory board made up of four people recommended by parliament,
four put forth by the prime minister and one nominated by the
employee council.
   The commission also advocated abolishing the monopoly on
preparing and distributing radio and TV broadcasts, and allowing
limited commercialization of the stations, PAP said.
   There has been a proposal to make the second TV channel
commercial, and to sell a portion of the air time to private
producers.
   Last week, the pro-Solidarity newspaper reported that 40 of the
124 TV managers and all the regional TV center directors had been
replaced by Drawicz, and that all TV correspondents posted to
socialist countries had been recalled.

   A mailman faces up to a year in jail
for shooting a dog to death as its owner was about to hand the
letter carrier a Christmas bottle of vodka.
   Floyd B. Sterling, 34, pleaded no contest Wednesday to animal
cruelty. The postman told police he fired in self-defense at
Skippy, a German shepherd mix he maintains bit him earlier.
   Sterling accepted a plea bargain in which prosecutors dropped
charges of carrying a concealed weapon and using a firearm in a
grossly negligent manner.
   ``Our office felt the crux of the matter was felony cruelty to
animals,'' said Deputy District Attorney David R. Lopez. ``It's a
good disposition.''
   Sterling could have received three years in prison if convicted
on all counts. He now faces up to a year in jail and a $20,000 fine
at sentencing March 29.
   Sterling was arrested Dec. 26 after he shot Skippy just as dog's
owner, Tammie Brody, emerged from her house with his Christmas
present.
   Brody testified that Sterling ``freaked out'' and fired a
.22-caliber revolver at the dog. She maintained her dog did not
menace the mailman.
   She was pleased with the outcome, saying, ``I just wanted
justice done, not blood.''
   Skippy was buried Jan. 3 at a pet cemetery in an elaborate
ceremony that included a tombstone and silk-lined casket. The
Postal Service paid the more than $600 cost.

   Security was tightened at
this Air Force cargo and transportation base today after
authorities said they ``identified a terrorist threat'' against it.
   The increased security included more gate checks at the base 60
miles east of Los Angeles and more security patrols, according to
statement from Col. Edward J. Sheeran, vice commander of the 63rd
Military Airlift Wing.
   The statement did not identify the type of threat, when it was
received or what it said. It said there had been no terrorist
action against the base.
   An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles declined to comment, although
Sheeran's statement said the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations and the FBI were working on the investigation.
   Sheeran termed the increased security action as ``prudent.''
   Norton Air Force Base was involved in the U.S. invasion of
Panama in December, supplying C-141 cargo planes.

   Leftist groups and rebel soldiers
Thursday marked the fourth anniversary of the revolt that brought
Corazon Aquino to power by demanding her ouster and calling her a
U.S. puppet who betrayed the rebellion.
   About 10,000 workers, students and slum dwellers rallied in
central Manila and demanded the removal of six U.S. military bases
in the Philippines.
   Riot police, a barbed wire barricade and fire trucks blocked
about 1,000 protesters who tried to march on the presidential
palace. They dispersed after a brief rally.
   The Revolutionary Alliance for the Masses-Soldiers of the
Filipino People, a rebel military group, said it decried ``the
treachery of this government and how readily it has surrendered our
sovereignty to foreign powers.'' The group spearheaded a December
coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino.
   The protest marked the anniversary of the Feb. 22-25, 1986,
civilian-backed military revolt that drove President Ferdinand
Marcos into exile in Hawaii and installed Mrs. Aquino as president.
   The government's main anniversary celebration will be held
Sunday.
   Leto Villar, executive vice chairman of the May First Movement
labor federation, said Thursday's protest was ``symbolic of a
deadlock'' between the workers and the Aquino government.
   ``We are handing her a notice of strike,'' Villar told the
demonstrators. ``Unless she can show that she would fulfill her
promises of reforms ... she cannot rely on the support of the
progressive forces even if her government faces another coup
attempt.
   ``Under this regime, the people continue to wallow in poverty
and Mrs. Aquino continues to be a U.S. puppet because she needs
American support,'' said federation spokesman Nick Elman.
   The crowd chanted, ``Down with the U.S.-Aquino regime!'' and
``Out with the U.S. bases!''
   Nathaniel Santiago, chairman of the militant League of Filipino
Students, said Mrs. Aquino should not fear losing U.S. support in a
future coup attempt, but instead should ``fear a lack of support
from her own people.''
   He referred to air cover provided by jets from the U.S. Clark
Air Base during the first day of the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt that
turned the tide against the rebellion.
   In a statement, the rebel soldiers accused the Aquino government
of ``unparalleled corruption and insatiable appetite for revenge.''
   The rebels said the Aquino government has allowed foreigners to
dominate the economy and political life in the Philippines.
   The group, whose principal leaders were among those who began
the 1986 revolt, said the administration was ``appealing abjectly
for foreign intervention to save it from the wrath of a
long-suffering populace with legitimate grievance.''
   The Communist New People's Army issued a statement ``saluting''
Filipinos for participating in the ``people power'' revolt.
   ``At the same time, we are hopeful that people power will again
be ignited in a revolutionary uprising toward genuine democracy and
freedom,'' the statement said.
   Leftists are as opposed to the military rebels as they are to
Aquino. They have accused right-wing officers of plotting the
murder of their own leaders.
   The lease on the six U.S. military bases in the Philippines
expires in 1991 and there is growing sentiment in the Philippines
against renewing the contract.

   A legislator has been expelled from
Parliament for a drug-trafficking conviction in the United States.
   The behavior of Alfred James Verdier was ``criminal both under
the laws of Liberia and that of the United States of America, and
as such was an embarrassment and brought disgrace to the
legislature, the government and people of Liberia,'' said a
parliamentary committee statement announcing the expulsion
Wednesday.
   Verdier, who was elected to Parliament in 1985, was arrested in
New York City in June with 22 pounds of heroin, worth nearly $2
million on the street.
   He initially told police he knew nothing about the drugs, but at
a trial this year admitted to importing them for sale in the United
States.
   The legislator is awaiting sentencing. He faces a minimum
sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for first offenders.

<HEAD>Soviets Suggests Overall Troops Ceiling in Central Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union suggested Thursday that
NATO and the Warsaw Pact limit themselves to 700,000 to 750,000
soldiers each in central Europe, an East German negotiator said.
   Since the Soviets and United States have agreed to 195,000 each
in central Europe and East bloc nations are reducing their armies,
the East will have fewer soldiers in the area than the West, said
Klaus-Dieter Ernst, chief East German delegate to talks on reducing
conventional military forces.
   Ernst said these factors would result in a maximum of 700,000
soldiers for the seven Warsaw Pact countries against about 1
million for the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which
he called ``totally unsatisfactory.''
   Western sources said NATO now has about 900,000 troops in
central Europe. To meet the agreed superpower ceilings, the United
States will have to withdraw 60,000 soldiers.
   The Soviet idea came up at the last meeting before a three-week
recess in the talks, which began in March 1989, but it was not
presented as a formal proposal.
   In Washington, U.S. arms officials said they were baffled by the
Soviet suggestion, which they said was made without prior
consultation with other Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``We are so confused we cannot be indignant,'' one said, on
condition his name not be used. ``They could not even get their
Warsaw Pact allies to agree to it, and the Western response was,
`This is a non-starter.'''
   Last week, the Soviet Union and United States announced an
agreement to reduce to 195,000 each the number of soldiers
stationed in an area covering the two Germanys, Belgium,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
Poland.
   Another 30,000 U.S. soldiers will be allowed in Britain and
southern Europe to compensate for the great distance between the
United States and Europe.
   The agreement, reached at a meeting of NATO and Warsaw Pact
foreign ministers last week in Ottawa, Canada, is to be part of a
final accord on reducing manpower, tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear arms in Europe, which negotiators hope to conclude this
year.
   Ruediger Hartmann, the chief West German delegate, said in his
statement to the final session the negotiations ``are now moving at
a rate commensurate with the rapidity of political processes in
Europe,'' according to a text made available to journalists.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia are negotiating for total withdrawal
of Soviet troops from their territory. They and Poland have
announced reductions in their own armed forces.
   About 50,000 Soviet military personnel are stationed in Hungary
and 75,000 in Czechoslovakia.
   Ernst said the overall ceiling suggested by the Kremlin would
include national armies and Soviet troops stationed on foreign soil.
   Both sides presented new proposals Thursday aimed at resolving
definitions of certain armaments and treaty language on
verification.
   Hartmann presented two working papers for NATO on information
exchange and conditions for inspections. Ernst said he presented a
Warsaw Pact paper on defining tanks.
   Definitions of weapons categories has been a major problem in
the negotiations and the two sides also disagree on the number of
combat aircraft each side should have.
   ``Lots of work remains to be done here,'' the chief U.S.
delegate, R. James Woolsey, told reporters.

<HEAD>Bad Weather Hampers Attempts to Douse Tire Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAGERSVILLE, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters trudged through thick
mud Thursday trying to douse the flames on millions of burning
tires after bad weather grounded three airplanes that had been used
to fight the 11-day-old blaze.
   The fire outside Hagersville, a southeastern Ontario city about
150 miles east of Detroit, has spewed toxic fumes that forced
hundreds of nearby residents to flee their homes.
   Environment Ministry spokesman John Steele said tests were being
conducted to determine if oil runoff from the tires could affect
local water supplies.
   ``We've found oil in the water below the surface but it's being
separated and moved into holding ponds,'' Steele said, adding that
it did not appear any oil had seeped more than three feet into the
ground.
   ``The main water table that serves people in the the area is
much deeper down,'' said Steele.
   The fire broke out at the Tyre King Recyling dump Feb. 11. The
site contained 12 million to 14 million discarded tires.
   On Wednesday, officials launched an all-out assault on the blaze
by deploying three planes usually used to fight forest fires.
   At the same time, ground crews wearing oxygen masks used
bulldozers and backhoes to separate the tires, trying to turn a
mountain of them into small stacks that could be attacked and
extinguished.
   The planes flew all day between the dump and nearby Lake Erie,
fetching thousands of gallons of water to dump on the flames along
with foam.
   Bad weather Thursday grounded the planes, leaving the ground
crew to battle the flames alone. About 40 firefighters worked at a
time, on six-hour shifts.
   ``It's pretty slow going because of all the mud,'' Ralph
D'Antonio of the Ontario fire marshal's office said after a morning
visit to the Tyre King dump. ``Because of the rain there's not a
lot of flames visible, but there is smoke.''
   Waste water from the fire has contaminated a local creek and
some farmers have been warned not to use the water for their
animals. The province is supplying bottled water.
   Tyre King, Ontario's largest tire dump, was declared an illegal
waste site in December 1985 by the government.
   The Environment Ministry said last week that Ontario taxpayers
could end up paying an estimated $1 million to clean up the damage
caused by the fire if Straza is unable to pay for it.
   Some environmental experts have said the fire could burn for
months. The hundreds who have been evacuated from a 2{-mile radius
will be eligible for compensation, the government has said.

<HEAD>Boston Cracks Down on Violence With More Marked Police Cruisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undercover police are driving in marked cars and
some are getting into uniform as authorities try to stem the number
of killings in this city, where 22 people have been slain since the
beginning of the year.
   ``They don't shoot people in front of marked units. We're hoping
the increased visibility will be a deterrent to violent crime.
Hopefully that will give them pause, and give the neighborhoods a
greater sense of security,'' said Superintendent Paul Evans, who
heads the police Bureau of Field Services.
   As of Wednesday, 22 people had been shot, knifed or beaten to
death. In the same time period last year, 14 people were killed. In
all, there were 100 homicides in Boston in 1989 and 98 in 1988.
   All but six of the killings occurred in the neighborhoods of
Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury, a lower- to middle-class area
inhabited by about 150,000 people, police spokesman Jim Jordan said
Thursday.
   This week, plainclothes police patrolled the most troubled
sections of the city in 12 additional marked cars. Some undercover
officers also donned uniforms before getting behind the wheel.
Police would not disclose the total number of cruisers deployed.
   Evans said the action is a departure for the police. After
Police Commissioner Francis Roache took over in 1985, there was an
increase in the number of specialty units, plainclothes police and
officers patrolling in unmarked cars.
   Evans credited the use of unmarked cruisers with boosting last
year's arrest rate by 20 percent. But he added, ``More arrests does
not mean less violence.''
   Police believe many of the latest slayings are linked to drugs
or gangs.
   The issue took up most of Wednesday's monthly closed meeting of
the Governor's Anticrime Council, The Boston Globe cited
participants as saying.
   State Sen. Paul White, who represents Dorchester, appealed for
help from the state. Invoking memories of the tensions during the
busing crisis of the 1970s, White suggested having state and
metropolitan police assist Boston police.
   ``Those agencies helped out during busing and I think we've
reached a crisis stage here,'' White said after the meeting.
   Response to the deployment of more marked cars was generally
favorable.
   ``It can't get any worse out there,'' said Sgt. William
Broderick, president of the Boston Police Superior Officers
Federation and a critic of the administration. The new tactic, he
said, ``is worth a shot.''
   Georgette Watson, founder of the anti-crime program Drop-A-Dime,
said, ``I think that probably will satisfy the community people, to
see more uniformed police out on the street.''
   Earlier this week, Deputy Police Superintendent William
Celester, commenting on the numbers of shootings, said that if gang
members could shoot straight, there would be even more slayings.
   ``Not only are drug dealers killing other drug dealers, but they
also are shooting innocent people,'' Celester said.
   The latest killings included the shooting of a 15-year-old boy
in a $5 holdup, the knifing of a 28-year-old man and the shooting
of an 18-year-old found dead in a Roxbury home, police said.

   The mighty microbe strikes again.
   Five fearless astronauts and the world's very best spacecraft
were poised this week to rocket into orbit with a spy satellite
that might be vital to the nation's security.
   NASA, the powerful technological force that conquered the moon
and sent craft soaring toward distant stars, had done everything
possible to prepare for the cloak-and-dagger mission. An army of
engineers and technicians had given their best and were standing
by, awaiting the final countdown.
   Then the microbe came along.
   Some ``bug'' so small that even a microscope might not find it
had somehow invaded the pristine premises of America's space
program and struck down one of the nation's best.
   Atlantis' commander John O. Creighton, NASA said, had developed
a sore throat and congestion. It hurt to swallow and the nose was
all stuffy.
   If he were on television, Creighton would have been the
``before'' portrait in some cold medicine commercial. If he were a
6th grader, Mom would have kept him home.
   But Creighton is an astronaut about ready to take the controls
in a $1 billion spacecraft carrying a half billion-dollar payload.
And when an astronaut crewman gets sick, everybody stays at home.
The mission was postponed twice and won't go now before Saturday.
   It's happened before to NASA. In 1969, Apollo 9 was delayed for
three days while the three-man crew recovered from the sniffles.
   A year later, NASA doctors learned that Apollo 13 astronaut
Thomas K. Mattingly had been exposed to the measles, another mean
little microbe. Mattingly was removed from the flight and back-up
pilot John Swigert was put on board. As it turned out, the Apollo
13 crew almost died when an oxygen tank exploded, and Mattingly,
safe at home, never developed the measles.
   NASA may do technological marvels and accomplish feats of wonder
in outer space. But it still hasn't conquered the mighty microbe.
   The agency tries. Astronauts preparing for a mission are
isolated for a week before launch. NASA posts warnings about the
isolation and takes pains to make sure that anyone but close family
wears a mask around the crew members.
   During the Apollo program, the isolation was even stricter. A
NASA doctor caused the cancellation of plans to have President
Nixon have dinner with the Apollo 11 astronauts before the launch
of that first moon-landing mission.
   Asked two days later if he had been worried about catching a
cold or something from a presidential dinner, Apollo 11 astronaut
Mike Collins shook his head.
   ``I'm sure,'' he said, deadpan, ``that presidential germs are
benign.''

   Between 1.8 million and 2.3 million East
Germans will resettle in West Germany this decade, a study said
Thursday, but it did not specifically address how the rush toward
reunification would affect the trend.
   The number of resettlers will depend in large part on the pace
of political and economic reforms in what is now East Germany,
according to the respected DIW research institute of West Berlin.
   While the comprehensive study did not specifically address the
most recent steps toward unification, East Germany's economic
problems are so enormous that the political joining of the two
countries is unlikely to slow the migration.
   The prospects of massive unemployment in what is now East
Germany once free-market reforms take hold and a higher standard of
living in the West are likely to keep fueling the exodus.
   Full integration of the two countries could take several years.
   Already this year, about 100,000 East Germans reached the West,
severely straining local governments' ability to house and provide
for them. More than 340,000 East Germans made the same trek last
year.
   They have already contributed to a massive housing shortage in
one of Europe's most populous countries, while many West Germans
have called for curbs on the influx.
   Many fear that even an expected unification will do little to
halt the westward flow. DIW, officially called the Deutsches
Institut fuer Wirtschaftsforschung, confirmed some of those fears.
   The economics research institute said if ``comprehensive reforms
are put into motion quickly'' and there is hope of creating more
prosperity, the number of people leaving what is now East Germany
will be 1.8 million by the end of the century.
   DIW said that situation would lead to an average exodus of
230,000 people a year through 1995.
   DIW also projected a situation in which the East Germans
perceive the ``reform process is being delayed.'' In that case,
said the study, 2.3 million people from East Germany will resettle
in the West in the 1990s.
   West German businesses already are entering into joint ventures
in East Germany, with the agreements calling for massive layoffs to
make businesses more efficient. That and other economic pressures
are likely to create even further difficulties and drive more
people out.
   Many of those leaving are young, skilled workers whose talents
are desperately needed for East Germany's faltering economy.
   Many other problems are also afflicting East Germany, including
crumbling housing and staggering pollution problems. Many of these
problems will take years to resolve.
   East Germans aren't the only ones heading to the riches of West
Germany. An estimated 377,000 ethnic Germans from other parts of
Eastern Europe arrived last year, and tens of thousands are
expected this year.
   The DIW study said that 1.3 million ethnic Germans would
resettle in West Germany by the end of the decade if reforms in the
rest of Eastern Europe proceed at a brisk pace. The number would be
1.6 million in the event the changes slow down.
   West Germany has about 62.4 million people, while the population
of East Germany is a little more than 16 million.

<HEAD>Sultan Forgives Chief Minister Who Secretly Married His Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah, ruler of
Malaysia's Selangor State, on Thursday forgave the state's chief
minister for marrying the sultan's daughter without his permission.
   The sultan last year had said he would never see Chief Minister
Muhammad Taib or receive him in audience for secretly marrying his
daughter, Tengku Putri Zahariah.
   At a news conference in his palace, the sultan said he was
taking the action in conjunction with his 64st birthday on March 8,
at which Muhammad would be allowed to read the ceremonial loyalty
speech.
   The sultan's daughter secretly married Muhammad in 1987, but the
sultan learned about it only late last year.
   The sultan said Muhammad had written to him three times asking
for forgiveness and pledging loyalty.
   He said his daughter had not asked for forgiveness, but out of
fatherly love he was forgiving her and reinstating her monthly
allowance of $259.
   The sultan is a constitutional monarch. Political power is
vested in the chief minister and an elected state legislature.
   The sultan also said he was forgiving Housing and Local
Government Minister Lee Kim Sai and restoring his title of
``datuk,'' a knighthood, which he had taken away on Oct. 23, 1987.
Lee was accused then of fanning anti-Malay feeling.

   The chancellor of the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst will assume the additional role of university president
after David C. Knapp steps down in March, the school announced
Thursday.
   As president, Joseph Duffey will oversee fiscal operations at
the university's three campuses at Amherst, Boston and Worchester.
Knapp, 62, announced Thursday that he will leave on March 16 after
almost 12 years on the job.
   At a board of trustees meeting, Duffey, 57, said he was taking
the job with some reluctance because the university's financial
state will require layoffs.
   ``Who would look forward to eliminating the jobs of hard-working
men and women?'' he asked.
   Duffey, chancellor for nearly eight years, intends to bring much
of the president's operation to the Amherst campus from Boston, the
university said.
   Amherst is the largest campus in the UMass system, which has a
total enrollment of about 40,000.

<HEAD>Government Alleges Fraud in Sales of Water Treatment Devices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six nationwide telemarketing firms, all based
in Arlington, Texas, have been charged with fraudulent practices
involving the sale of home water treatment products, the government
said Thursday.
   Investigators raided the telephone ``boiler rooms'' of the
companies a day earlier, seized their records and obtained
temporary court orders freezing their assets and barring them from
future misrepresentations, the Federal Trade Commission said.
   The move was the seventh major enforcement action by the FTC
since 1987 against firms that allegedly have preyed upon consumers'
fears about the safety of their drinking water by marketing
products under false or misleading claims.
   The Texas operation was coordinated with the Justice Department,
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Texas Attorney General's
Office, said Barry J. Cutler, director of the FTC's Bureau of
Consumer Protection.
   Cutler said the FTC had filed two civil complaints in U.S.
District Court in Fort Worth seeking refunds to the defendants'
customers and permanent injunctions against fraudulent practices in
the future.
   One complaint was lodged against five firms, GTP Marketing Inc.,
Telstar Marketing Network Inc., H.S. Marketing Inc., Unitel
Marketing Consultants Inc., and MBC Group Inc., all located at the
same Watson Road address in Arlington. Three individuals, Todd
Arnold, Stephen Gregg Echols, and Pat Arnold, also were named in
that complaint.
   A reporter's call to those individuals, at the number listed for
Unitel, was not immediately returned. Three of the companies were
not publicly listed; the telephone listed at the fourth, H.S.
Marketing, was not answered.
   The second complaint was aimed at C &amp; L Industries, Inc., and
its two officers, Ramon Haas and T. W. Bodiford. Both were said by
a secretary to be out of the office and unavailable for comment on
Thursday.
   ``Ever since water quality emerged as a consumer concern a
couple of years ago, fraudulent telemarketers and others have
aggressively promoted their products by using scare tactics,
blatantly false claims about federal endorsements of their
products, and gross exaggerations about their products' ability to
cleanse and purify water,'' Cutler said.
   ``They offer lavish awards and prizes and money-back guarantees.
They will say anything to make a sale,'' he said.
   In the case of C &amp; L, which markets the ``Atlantis Water
Purification System,'' the firm told prospective customers several
falsehoods, including claims that a bill pending in Congress will
require every home to have a water treatment device, and that its
product had been endorsed by the government and was used on the
U.S. space shuttle, according to the FTC complaint.
   Cutler said C &amp; L also claimed that ``Unpure water killed more
people last year in the United States than cholesterol and nicotine
combined,'' and that its device, marketed for $450-$500, could
virtually eliminate such contaminants as lead, bacteria, radon gas,
acid rain, pesticides, and industrial run-off from up to 15,000
gallons or more of tap water.
   Not only will the device not do that, he said, but ``you could
go to the hardware store and get something like it for less than
$100.''
   The five other firms were charged with luring in customers by
mailing them postcards claiming they had won valuable awards, such
as a Cadillac or $5,000 in merchandise checks. In fact, the awards
required payment of ``substantial additional sums of money,'' the
FTC complaint said, and when consumers called in, the firms falsely
claimed they needed their credit-card numbers to verify their
``eligibility'' _ and then debited those accounts without
authorization. The complaint charged further that many consumers
who did order a product, such as a water treatment unit, never
received it.
   Cutler noted that ``there are many legitimate companies selling
useful home water treatment devices, and consumers who do their
homework ... can get their money's worth.''

   The state's highest court Thursday reinstated an
order barring demonstrators from blocking abortion clinics, but the
group Operation Rescue said it will obey a ``higher law'' and
continue to protest.
   The Supreme Judicial Court ruled 4-1 that the injunction places
only minimal limitations on protesters and does not threaten their
First Amendment rights.
   Darroline Firlit, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, which has
staged several protests at clinics, said her anti-abortion group
will continue its activities.
   ``We have an obligation before God to continue to rescue,''
Firlit said. ``In this case, we are obeying a higher law.''
   Dorothy Lohmann of Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts said her
organization was pleased with the decision.
   ``In the future, one of the things we are looking for is to have
bigger fines imposed on those who break the injunction,'' she said.
   Under the ruling, the injunction will remain in place until the
outcome of a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and several
clinics. They charge that Operation Rescue threatened and
intimidated patients and clinic staff members.
   The high court's ruling reverses a single justice's decision in
August to lift an injunction against the protesters. The other
justices reversed Justice Joseph Nolan's ruling.
   Justice Francis O'Connor dissented, arguing that the injunction
infringes on free speech rights and that the abortion-rights groups
don't represent women claiming direct harm from the protests.
   Legal challenges to Operation Rescue's tactics around the
country have left the organization so far in debt that it announced
Jan. 31 that it was closing its national office in Binghamton, N.Y.
   The group is appealing a $50,000 judgment in a New York lawsuit
by the National Organization for Women. However, it won a case in
federal court in Los Angeles, where a judge ruled clinic blockades
do not violate the rights of all prospective patients.

<HEAD>Reagan Testifies No `Inkling' of Arms Help to Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan testified in a
videotaped deposition released Thursday he never ``had any
inkling'' his aides were secretly arming the Nicaraguan Contras
during a congressional ban on military aid.
   In testimony for the upcoming trial of John Poindexter, the
former president also said he remained unconvinced there had been a
diversion of Iran arms sale money to the rebels _ until prosecutors
confronted him with the report of the Tower Commission he appointed.
   Reagan said he would have expected Poindexter, his former
national security adviser, to inform him of any diversion of funds
to the Contras ``unless maybe he thought he was protecting me from
something.''
   Reagan's testimony was taken in Los Angeles last week and made
available in Washington. The former president was jovial and testy
by turns during eight hours _ winking at Poindexter as he took the
stand and talking amiably with the judge but also answering in
abrupt fashion when Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb said he wasn't
addressing a question.
   He said at numerous points that he couldn't recall a date, a
name, whether someone had told him something or not.
   Reagan said decisively that he agreed with a letter Poindexter
sent Congress saying the White House was complying with the ban on
help for the Contras _ a letter that forms part of the basis for
one charge Poindexter faces.
   But he also said, when told by prosecutors, that he was learning
from them for the first time that former National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessor, had pleaded guilty to
misleading Congress in the affair.
   Reagan testified, ``It was my impression'' that National
Security Council aide Oliver North's assistance to the Contras was
limited to ``communicating back and forth ... on the need for the
support of the Contras.''
   ``I guess that I had never ... had any inkling that we were
guiding their strategy in any way,'' Reagan testified under
questioning by Webb.
   Asked what he thought North was doing, Reagan said that ``you
have to have people that can be available to make contact with the
leaders of the Contras ... sometimes closer than just writing a
letter.''
   ``It was my understanding because his name would crop up in
memos and so forth that that's what he was doing,'' the former
president added.
   Poindexter, who faces trial March 5, is charged with conspiracy,
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements.
   It was Poindexter's lawyers who had won a court order to take
Reagan's testimony, hoping to show Reagan had approved of the
activities that led to his former adviser's indictment.
   However, Iran-Contra prosecutors used cross-examination of
Reagan to introduce evidence that Poindexter lied to Reagan about
the secret aid operation after a C-123 cargo plane was shot down
over Nicaragua during a supply flight on Oct. 5, 1986.
   In written interrogatories to the Iran-Contra grand jury
earlier, Reagan said Poindexter first told him that the sole
survivor of the crash, Eugene Hasenfus was not connected with the
U.S. government.
   Hasenfus, who was tried and convicted of terrorism by
Nicaragua's Sandinista government and later released, was involved
in North's secret resupply effort, according to investigators.
   During his videotaped testimony, Reagan said he couldn't recall
which adviser told him about the crash and said he did not know if
Hasenfus was connected with North's secret operation.
   Reagan said Thursday that ``no one has proven to me'' that
profits from secret arms sales to Iran were diverted to the rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   But later in his testimony Reagan was confronted with details of
the diversion from the February 1987 Tower Commission report.
   ``This is the first time that I have ever seen a reference that
actually specified there was a diversion,'' Reagan said of the
much-publicized report.
   ``Is this the first time ... that you came to realize in fact
that a diversion had actually occurred?'' asked Webb.
   ``Yes,'' replied Reagan.
   Webb asked whether Reagan expected Poindexter to report such a
diversion to his boss.
   ``Yes,'' replied Reagan. ``Unless maybe he thought he was
protecting me from something.''
   At that point Reagan seemed to lose his train of thought,
saying, ``But, no, I don't understand. This is very confusing to me
about this.''
   Poindexter told Congress in 1987 that he purposely didn't tell
the president about the diversion in order to provide him with
``deniability.''
   Reagan grew testy with Webb, who told U.S. District Court Judge
Harold Greene that the former president had not answered his
question. Reagan retorted that he was trying to be responsive.
   He said he ``assured everybody that we would have to abide by
the law'' during the ban on Contra military aid.
   Reagan also testified under oath that he never authorized
Poindexter to obstruct congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra
affair or to destroy documents.
   He said he was never told that North had destroyed Iran-Contra
documents, an act for which the former aide was convicted of a
felony last year.
   Reagan may have helped Poindexter by testifying that he could
not recall when he knew about a November 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran. The shipment figures in four of the five criminal
charges against Poindexter. Poindexter is accused of telling
Congress in November 1986 that U.S. officials didn't find out that
Hawks were aboard the 1985 shipment until January 1986.
   Poindexter told Congress in 1987, in testimony that cannot be
used in his trial, that he had given incorrect information earlier
to Congress because of a faulty memory.
   ``I don't know when it would have been told to me or I would
have known,'' Reagan said when asked about when he found out about
the 1985 Hawk shipment. ``I, some place along the line, acquired
that knowledge, and I don't know from whom or where.''

<HEAD>Vermont Governor Suspends Press Secretary Over Lewd Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin has suspended her
press secretary without pay for two weeks for making a comment of a
sexual nature to a woman reporter.
   The suspension was ordered late Wednesday, one day after Peter
Freyne made the comment, which he said was a joke. The remark came
when Betsy Liley of The Burlington Free Press asked him for a
preview of the governor's revenue forecast.
   Freyne's reply: ``If you took off all your clothes and
(performed a lewd act) I might tell you.''
   He paused, then added: ``Even if you did that, I wouldn't tell
you.''
   The exchange was overheard by another reporter and a Kunin
official, both of whom confirmed the comment. It came to Kunin's
attention when a reporter for the Rutland Herald asked her about it
for a story.
   On Tuesday Kunin termed the remark ``totally inappropriate. I
think it was a sexist remark, but I don't think that Peter really
is sexist.''
   She suspended Freyne the following day after a growing number of
legislators and women's groups protested.
   In a letter to Freyne, Kunin said, ``I found totally
reprehensible your remark to a reporter. While you have apologized,
I believe you need some time to reflect on the impact of that
remark.''
   Freyne, a former reporter, said, ``I learned my lesson. I'm no
longer a member of the Fourth Estate. The cynical, sardonic,
`Saturday Night Live' wit of the Fourth Estate Club is now verboten
to me. If I offended Betsy or anyone, I'm terribly sorry.''
   The editor of the monthly magazine Vermont Woman said the
publication would call for Freyne's dismissal in its March issue.
``To have him in that position, showing such insensitivity to women
is a liability to Madeleine,'' said Gayle M.B. Hanson.
   Kunin, the state's first woman governor, has taken an active
role nationally in promoting women's participation in politics and
was vice chairwoman of the 1988 Democratic National Convention.
   She is expected to seek a fourth two-year term in November and
could face a tough race against former Gov. Richard Snelling, the
leading Republican candidate.

<TEXT>
   A Romanian cabinet minister on Thursday said
he was seeking $500 million in aid from the United States, in
addition to gifts of food.
   During his recent trip to Romania, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III offered Romania $80 million in U.S. aid, including
500,000 tons of feed grain and 7,500 tons of butter.
   ``Eighty million is an important amount but let me say that it's
so samll for our desperate situation,'' Minister of State Dumitru
Mazilu told reporters. ``We need much more.''
   ``You understand, dear colleagues and friends, how difficult it
is for a mother to try to find food for children in the stores and
to get nothing,'' he added.
   Mazilu, who said he was discussing the aid request with members
of Congress, called the food situation in Romania worse than before
the overthrow of Communist President Nicolae Ceausescu in December.
   Mazilu said that immediately after Ceausescu's overthrow the
food situation improved temporarily when the new authorities
blocked exports, but food supplies diminished after a few weeks,
despite help from abroad.
   He said his country needed ``At least $500 million from the
United States, but at the same time we need help from other
countries. I have to underline that in Europe, France has told us
it is ready to help.''
   Mazilu asked for restoration by the United States of ``most
favored nation'' status for Romania, an arrangement that would
lower U.S. customs duties on his country's goods. Baker had said
previously that the matter was being re-examined for Romania and
other Eastern European countries. Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia
already have the arrangement.
   Mazilu was under house arrest when Ceausescu was overthrown and
said he, his wife and son were in danger of execution. His mother
and a brother had been killed by the Ceausescu government, he added.
   He was among the first leaders of the interim government but
resigned a month later because, he said, ``Stalinists'' were taking
it over. He rejoined the National Salvation Front on Feb. 1 when
members of political parties in addition to communists were added.
   Mazilu, a law professor, heads a group writing a new
constitution and an election law for the voting due on May 20.

<HEAD>Report Says Air Force Understates Weapons Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force significantly understated the
cost of billion-dollar weapons systems, making it ``all but
impossible'' to allocate the nation's limited funds, the chairman
of a Senate panel said Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found that the Air Force lacks adequate accounting
systems for its $275 billion in weapons systems, inventories and
other assets and annual appropriations of about $90 billion.
   In response to news stories on the report, Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
issued a statement criticizing the Air Force and urging the service
to act quickly to rectify its accounting problems.
   ``This audit has uncovered some significant weaknesses which
make it all but impossible for us to allocate our limited resources
wisely or to identify areas that are highly susceptible to waste
and fraud,'' Glenn said.
   Following a three-year audit, the GAO discovered that among
other things, the Air Force understated the cost of the B-1 bomber
by at least $7.1 billion in its financial statements.
   ``The Air Force accounting and financial management systems can
neither provide complete and reliable financial data nor be
depended upon to report accurately on the resources entrusted to
its managers,'' the GAO said.
   A draft copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press.
   The report faulted the Air Force's financial systems as being
unable to provide managers with complete and reliable information
on either acquisition or operating costs of aircrafts and missiles.
   ``The procurement cost for each B-1 bomber is reported by the
Air Force to be $150 million; GAO found that the cost is, in fact,
about $219 million.'' Similar underestimates exist with the F-15
and F-16 aircraft, the agency said.
   Charles Bowsher, U.S. comptroller general, plans to testify
before the Senate panel Friday on the GAO report.
   Meanwhile, at the Pentagon, officials released a two-page letter
the Defense Department's comptroller general sent to the GAO on the
report as well as a point-by-point response to the agency's 26
recommendations.
   ``The department is concerned that the report may mislead some
readers into thinking that the Air Force has misstated the cost of
its aircraft or other programs to the Congress,'' Sean O'Keefe, the
Pentagon's comptroller general, wrote.
   He said the Air Force reports its costs to Congress through
several channels.
   But he also said the Air Force understands its accounting system
needs improvement.
   The GAO report, titled ``Air Force Does Not Effectively Account
for Billions of Dollars of Resources,'' found that the service
reported $63.8 billion in supplies and spare parts _ eight times
the inventories of General Motors.
   ``However, the systems used to provide accountability over these
immense inventories do not provide reliable data supporting either
their quantities or value,'' the GAO said.
   The agency also discovered that almost $630 million worth of
satellites and about $5.7 million worth of engines for C-20A cargo
planes that the Air Force paid for and owned were not recorded in
any Air Force property or accounting system.

<HEAD>Bush Presents Award to Arkansas Architect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush presented the American
Institute of Architects' 1990 gold medal Thursday to Fay Jones of
Arkansas, whom he praised for creating ``architecture of great
power and space.''
   Bush said at a White House ceremony he was restoring a tradition
practiced by earlier presidents. The honor was last conferred by
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.
   ``Architecture holds up a mirror to the soul of any nation,''
Bush said.
   Jones' award, announced in December, was for a wooden chapel
built in the southern Mississippi savanna.
   ``Through humble materials and simple forms, Mr. Jones has
created architecture of great power and and space,'' Bush said.
   He said Jones' buildings have ``rare beauty and dignity'' and
``touch the heart as well as the mind.''
   ``Grounded firmly in his Ozark roots, Fay Jones has created a
truly American architecture that is respected the world over,''
Bush said.
   Jones said receiving the award at the White House was ``the
honor of a lifetime.''
   He said ``architects everywhere are pleased that you have now
re-established a tradition, after over 50 years, of having this
medal presented at the White House.''
   Jones, and other winners of architectural awards, were to be
honored later Thursday at the institute's annual awards banquet.
Prince Charles, who has had a longtime interest in architecture,
was to deliver the principal address.

   Q. And I guess you had concerns, did you not, at that time that
Congress was going to delay. If it were _
   A. Yes.
   Q. _ going to give any funding to the administration for the
Contras or the freedom fighters, it was going to be delayed even
more? Did you have concerns about that?
   A. We were always concerned, yes.
   Q. Did you and Admiral Poindexter discuss any actions that you
should take with regard to Congress on getting this funding that
you can think of?
   A. I can't think of anything more than just encouraging them to
carry the battle to them.
   Q. To carry the battle to _ I am sorry.
   A. To the Congress about the need and the very definite need for
continued help for these other countries down there.
   Q. And if you were not _ if were not able to get any money from
Congress in that spring of '86, what were you prepared to do? To
somehow do it anyway?
   A. Well, no. To find whatever way we could keep them in
existence.
   Q. And by that you are referring now once again to _
   A. To the Contras.
   Q. _ the third countries or private individuals?
   A. Yes. Them and the refugees. Their families were being _ had
to be taken care of while they were out there in the field and all.
   Q. ... Mr. President, do you know who Oliver North is?
   A. Yes.
   Q. Could you please describe to the jury what you know about
Oliver North and what his job was when he was working the White
House?
   A. Well, he was mainly performing tasks, as I understand it, for
the NSC (National Security Council), but he _ his background and
record had been one of being decorate for heroism and so forth in
the Vietnamese conflict, and that he had been a very bold and brave
soldier _ Marine.
   And _ so, he was _ it was my impression, not from any specific
reports or anything, that in through all of this that he was
communicating back and forth between on the need for the support of
the Contras and so forth.
   Q. When you say ``communication back and forth between,'' could
you be a little more explicit for the jury? Even though you and I
might know _
   A. Yeah.
   Q. _ maybe you can explain to the jury what you are referring to?
   A. Well, between the Contras and their situation and ourselves
and the things that we must do for them.
   Q. ... In 1985 and 1986, did you know _ just tell the jury
generally what you knew about what Oliver North was doing with
regard to helping the situation in Central America vis-a-vis the
freedom fighters?
   A. Well, you have to have people that can be available to make
contact with the leaders of the Contras and so forth, sometimes
closer than just writing a letter. And it was my feeling and my
understanding _ I did not meet individually with him to any extent
at all. But it was my understanding because his name would crop up
in memos and so forth that that's what he was doing.
   And I am trying to I think what the other angle. I know that
there was another area too in which he participated. Well, for
example, in the meeting with the Iranians, he was involved in that,
and I think was actually there in the meetings with them. Whether
all of the time or not, I am not familiar.
   Q. But in addition to Colonel North's contacts with the Contras,
do you know whether or not he had any contacts or made any
presentations or speeches to fund-raising groups that would raise
money for the Contras within the United States, the private
citizens?
   A. I don't know. I _ as I say, he would have been one that I
cautioned that must obey the law at all times. And I had made it
plain that I didn't think that we should be out there trying to
persuade the people to give money, but we should offer that help to
those who were doing that. That if they needed help in contacting
the leadership of the Contras and so forth, that he would be the _
in charge of that.

   The city is suing a group that organized
protests over the dismissal of a black school superintendent,
accusing the demonstrators of breaking laws and increasing racial
tension.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in state court after a federal
judge rejected a similar complaint, seeks an order barring the
group from further ``reckless conduct'' that disrupts education and
government services.
   The lawsuit accuses the group Best Educational Support Team of
encouraging students to skip school, using ``force, fear,
intimidation and actual violence'' in sit-ins at City Hall, and
acting to heighten racial tensions.
   The demonstrators are demanding an extension of the contract of
School Superintendent Norward Roussell, whose $80,000 job ends in
June. The six whites on the 11-member school board voted in
December against renewing the contract, setting off the protests.
   There have been demonstrations almost daily since Feb. 6. The
city's 11 public schools were closed for four days that week for
fear of violence. Of the city's 5,800 public school students, 75
percent are black.

<TEXT>
   Some West Virginia obstetricians are
turning away new patients and some say they may leave the state
because of a record $15 million malpractice award.
   ``We're working scared,'' Dr. Ujjal Sandhu of Charleston said
Thursday. ``Malpractice awards are skyrocketing. There should be
some reasonable compensation to victims, but they shouldn't be made
millionaires overnight.''
   A state jury last week awarded a couple $15.25 million after
they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a Caesarean
section to prevent brain damage to their child.
   Mark and Julie Robinson of Cabin Creek said Dr. Kanoj K. Biswas
and the Charleston Area Medical Center should have performed the
Caesarean section after her son got stuck in the birth canal during
delivery. Instead, the couple said, Biswas used forceps to remove
the baby, causing a cutoff of oxygen and a brain hemorrhage.
   Several Charleston obstetricians said in interviews that at
least seven of their colleagues have stopped taking new patients.
Some are leaving to practice in neighboring states with lower
insurance costs, Sandhu said.
   ``Some will probably leave if they get a chance. I would
leave,'' he said. ``I don't want to worry about losing my shirt.
The patients will have to go out of state just like the doctors are
leaving.''
   The award may compound the growing shortage of obstetricians in
the state, said Dr. Bruce Berry, chairman of the West Virginia
section of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
   The number of obstetricians in West Virginia has dropped from
135 to 65 in the last five years, Berry said. Twenty-one family
practitioners also deliver babies.
   There were 23,045 babies born in West Virginia last year,
according to the state Department of Health.
   Berry, of Charleston, said he quit obstetrics 14 months ago
mainly because of the high cost of malpractice insurance.
   Dr. Paul Fulcher of Charleston, who stopped taking new patients
in response to the malpractice award, said most obstetricians carry
a minimum $1 million malpractice insurance. Maximum coverage is $10
million, Berry said.
   West Virginia physicians pay about $63,000 in liability
insurance annually, up to twice as much as doctors in Virginia and
Kentucky, said George Rider, executive director of the West
Virginia Medical Association. The doctors' group is uncertain why
insurance companies charge more for malpractice insurance in West
Virginia, he said.
   Obstetricians fear a big malpractice judgement could ruin them
financially, Fulcher said.
   ``Most physicians had to think long and hard about this,'' Berry
said. ``But when it comes to the point where it threatens their
family's security, their family has to come first.''
   The average delivery costs $1,200 to $1,500, Berry said. That
would rise by $500 to cover the cost of a $10 million liability
policy, he said.
   Obstetricians have proposed the state establish a reserve fund
to cover large malpractice awards, or impose a cap on such awards.

<HEAD>Detained American Files Appeal for Release</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American detained last month,
purportedly for involvement with a cult known as the ``Path of
Bliss,'' appealed to the Supreme Court on Thursday to gain her
release, her lawyer said.
   Patricia E. Munday of Vermont was ``illegally detained by the
West Bengal state on Jan. 27 in violation of laws, apparently for
her religious links,'' said her lawyer, V. M. Tarkunde.
   Tarkunde said Ms. Munday, 38, is associated with Anand Marg, or
the ``Path of Bliss.'' The mysterious cult was founded in West
Bengal in 1955 by a former Indian Railways employee, Prabhat Ranjan
Sarkar.
   Ms. Munday is a member of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees,
said Anand Marg general-secretary Sarbatmanada Avadhoota in
Calcutta, the West Bengal state capital, but was on a private visit
to India.
   Tarkunde said a mob attacked Ms. Munday and an unidentified
woman associate on Jan. 26 when they were traveling on a motorcycle
near the Anand Marg headquarters in Purulia district of West Bengal.
   He said Ms. Munday was seriously injured but the Purulia police,
instead of pursuing her complaint, detained her the next day.
   The lawyer said the attack on Ms. Munday was engineered by
``hooligans'' of the Marxist Communist party, which governs the
state in coalition with other leftist parties.
   Ms. Munday, whose hometown was not released, was being held at a
Calcutta hospital, said Avadhoota.
   Tarkunde said the Supreme Court has informed the state and
federal government of Ms. Munday's petition. It has asked them to
send representatives to a court hearing Friday, the lawyer said.
   The state government on Feb. 19 ordered Ms. Munday's deportation
without providing a reason, but the deportation was stayed
following an appeal to the state High Court, Tarkunde said.
   ``She was obviously attacked because she is an Anand Margi.
There is no other reason. Somehow the people dislike the Anand
Margis, but why should they be harassed?'' said Tarkunde, a
prominent human rights lawyer.
   The Anand Marg says it has worldwide chapters with the aim of
creating a socio-economic and spiritual order to replace both
capitalism and communism. But the cult is also believed to practice
black magic and human sacrifices, and one of its rituals involves a
dance holding skulls and daggers.
   Members of the Marxist Communist Party have in the past clashed
with Anand Marg members, who accuse the government of persecution.

<TEXT>
   Q. ... If the information that Robert McFarlane provided to
Congress in 1985 was false, contained lies, and deceived and
obstructed Congress, would it still be your belief that John
Poindexter should readopt those false statements in responding to
Congress on July 21, 1986?
   MR. BECKLER: Objection, your Honor. Calls for a legal conclusion.
   U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE HAROLD GREENE: Overruled.
   A. Well, I simply _ no, I did not have this information, but I
have a great deal of confidence in the man who was quoted as
sending these letters, McFarlane. And I have never _ I have never
caught him or seen him doing anything that was in any way out of
line or dishonest. And so, I was perfectly willing to accept his
defense.
   Q. I understand. But I am just asking you, as I understand it _
am I correct, Mr. President, that the letter that you are looking
at there from John Poindexter dated July 21, 1986, you, yourself,
actually did not approve and authorize those letters at the time
that they were sent; is that correct?
   A. I have no recollection of doing so.
   Q. ... Well, as you sit here now, do you have any recollection
of approving for John Poindexter to send these specific letters to
Congress?
   A. Well, again, it is a case of memory. I don't recall if he did
or not.
   Q. And my question to you is: Would you have approved the
sending of these letters to Congress by John Poindexter if you knew
that they adopted false information that had been previously
supplied to Congress by Mr. McFarlane?
   A. No. But I would also _ it would be very _ I would have to
have it proven to me that they did.
   Q. ... I take it as the Chief Executive and as President of the
United States, you did not want nor did you authorize your top
officials of your administration to provide false information to
Congress; is that a fair statement?
   A. That is a fair statement.
   Q. ... I take it that is a fair statement that you were
committed to helping the Contras within any legal bounds that you
could during that time period?
   A. Yes.
   Q. However, as I understand your testimony, at the same time
that you were _ that you were doing that, you attempted to keep
your administration's Contra assistance within the confines of the
law? At least that was your goal; is that correct?
   A. Yes.
   Q. ... On direct examination, you related to some extent that
your Attorney General Ed Meese on or about November 24, 1986 after
making some type of evaluation and inquiry into the Iranian arms
sale initiative advised you that he had discovered that there was
some Swiss bank accounts involved, and that money out of the Iran
arms sales appeared to have gone in some way to assist the Contras.
   Do you recall that?
   A. What I testified is that that's what was being published and
carried on by the press. But to this day, all I know is that some
sum of money over and above the 12.2-million-dollar purchase price
appeared in a Swiss bank account in which it was said that account
had been used on another occasion to provide help to the Contras.
And to this day, I still with all of the investigations that have
been made, I still have never been given one iota of evidence as to
who collected the price, who delivered the final delivery of the
weapons, or what was _ whether there was ever money in that Swiss
account that had been diverted someplace else. I am still waiting
to find those things out and have never found them out.
   Q. And at the time that the Iran initiative was ongoing, were
you aware that money was being diverted away from the Iranian arms
sales and diverted over to aid the Contras? Were you aware of that?
   A. No, I wasn't. I was only aware finally that we got our twelve
million two.
   Q. ... Had you approved or authorized that diversion while you
were President of the United States?
   A. May I simply point out that I had no knowledge then or now
that there had been a diversion, and I never used the term. And all
I knew was that there was some money that came from some place in
another account, and that the appearance was that it might have
been a part of the negotiated sale. And to this day, I don't have
any information or knowledge that that wasn't the total amount that
_ or that there was a diversion.
   Q. ... To the extent that there was in fact a diversion of
proceeds, did you in any way approve or authorize that while you
were President of the United States?
   A. For heaven's sake, no. And when I was once asked about that
extra money and said if it was an added sum to the purchase price,
what would I do, I said I would have given it back.
   Q. So, the answer to my question is that you did not authorize
or approve it; it that correct?
   A. That's right.
   Q. At any time, sir, while you were President, did you ever
approve or give authority to John Poindexter to obstruct or impede
any congressional committee inquiry into events relating to the
Iran-Contra controversy?
   A. No, I don't _
   Q. And at any time did you ever approve or give authority to
John Poindexter to make any false or misleading statements to any
congressional committee regarding events related to the Iran-Contra
controversy?
   A. No. And I don't think any false statements were made.
   Q. ... at any time, did John Poindexter ever tell you that he
had plans to make or cause others to make any false or misleading
statements to any congressional committees regarding events related
to the Iran-Contra affair?
   A. There was never any such thing that he ever said to me that
was false or misleading.

   NASA on Thursday delayed the launch
of Atlantis for a second day to let the shuttle's commander recover
from a sore throat and to await better weather.
   The secret military mission to put a spy satellite in orbit is
not expected to take off until Saturday morning at the earliest.
   The shuttle originally was scheduled for a pre-dawn liftoff
Thursday but was postponed Wednesday when Navy Capt. John O.
Creighton became ill, the second time the space program has delayed
a flight because of a sick astronaut.
   NASA delayed the launch yet another day on the recommendation of
doctors examining Creighton, who complained of a sore throat and
congestion.
   ``Physicians ... report that his condition has improved, but
that he still has some infection of the upper respiratory tract,''
the space agency said in a statement. ``Additionally, weather
conditions presently are not expected to be satisfactory for
(fueling) required for a morning launch.''
   NASA said it would decide whether to proceed with a Saturday
launch after examining Creighton and the forecast on Friday.
Saturday's outlook was a scant 20 percent chance for liftoff
because of an approaching cold front, but that was to improve to 70
percent by Sunday.
   In 1969, the Apollo 9 mission to orbit the Earth and test the
lunar landing module was delayed three days after the three crewmen
got sick.
   NASA said it had no plans to replace Creighton on the mission
because his illness was not serious. Responding in writing to
reporters' questions, NASA flight surgeons said the ``prognosis is
good,'' but they didn't say when the commander might be able to fly.
   Creighton was quarantined, and the four other crew members were
``healthy and isolated,'' the doctors said. Changes in cabin
pressure normally experienced in flight would cause Creighton pain
in his present condition, they said.
   The delays came before technicians had begun pumping more than
half a million gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank for
the four-day mission, which was to end at Edwards Force Base, Calif.
   Pumping the fuel would have added $377,000 to the cost to
Kennedy Space Center of delaying the mission. Each day's delay
costs $247,000 in labor and materials. That does not include
expenses at other NASA centers supporting the mission.
   Sources said Atlantis' cargo is a 37,300-pound, $500 million
satellite capable of taking super-sharp photos and eavesdropping on
electronic communications around the world. Its path will carry it
over most of the Soviet Union.
   NASA has not announced a precise launch time since Atlantis'
cargo is classified, but sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said it would take place around 1 a.m.
   Atlantis' flight will be the 34th shuttle flight and the sixth
secret military mission.

   Snipers exchanged gunfire intermittently
in the Christian enclave Thursday and mediators tried to forge a
settlement in the power struggle between rival Christian leaders.
   Police said about 3,000 families left east Beirut for the city's
Moslem western sector, the eastern Bekaa Valley and northern
Lebanon, fearing renewed clashes between the Lebanese Forces
militia of Samir Geagea and army troops of Gen. Michel Aoun.
   A three-man Christian mediation committee called a cease-fire
Saturday and has been meeting with Aoun and Geagea to try to work
out a settlement.
   The chances of prolonging the truce darkened Thursday evening
when Aoun accused Geagea of ``procrastinating to win time and
prepare for a new confrontation.''
   At least 681 people have been killed and 1,878 wounded since the
confrontation broke out Jan. 30 and escalated into the worst
intra-Christian fighting in nearly 15 years of civil war.
   The continued evacuation and stockpiling of weapons and
ammunition by the rival forces reflected fear that clashes could
break out again if mediation efforts failed, a police spokesman
said.
   Aoun called a televised news conference at his headquarters in
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda Thursday evening and
told reporters:
   ``There is no use negotiating with Geagea. He wants another
collision. We are giving the mediators deeds and he is giving them
words.
   ``I am letting the mediators try and try until they get fed up.
Then they will come to me and say they have given up. I don't give
the negotiations with Geagea much chance. Procrastination is going
to bring more disasters.''
   Aoun made no comment on an offer by Geagea for a ``unified
command'' for his 6,000-strong militia and the 19,000 troops under
Aoun.
   Geagea made the call in an interview with the London-based
Arabic language daily Al-Hayat.
   Geagea's offer appeared to be an attempt to put off Aoun's
demand that the militia be changed into a political organization
while its fighters join the army.
   ``All we want is political independence and the preservation of
the Lebanese Forces,'' Geagea said. ``We are ready to combine the
military effort (militia) with the army and the general within the
framework of a joint command.''
   Meanwhile, about 400 women demonstrated in east Beirut's
residential district of Ashrafiyeh _ controlled by Geagea's
militiamen _ demanding ``an end to the barbaric, destructive
shelling of our area.''
   ``We are Lebanese. We are Christians. Why have you knocked down
our houses?'' the demonstrators chanted.
   Ashrafiyeh, which sits on the highest hill in Beirut, commands
the network of roads leading to the city's port, which also is
controlled by Geagea's militiamen on the southwestern tip of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Military analysts said if hostilities resumed, Aoun would try to
overrun Ashrafiyeh to seize the port and ensure safe supply lines
by sea.
   Savage fighting has inflicted an estimated $750 million worth of
damage on the Christian enclave's residential districts and
commercial thoroughfares.
   The three-man mediation committee, said in a statement it has
``achieved progress'' in its mission to defuse the explosive
situation.
   ``The atmosphere is encouraging,'' the statement said without
elaborating.
   The independent newspaper An-Nahar said Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat also was mediating the conflict
between Geagea and Aoun.
   Arafat's representative in Lebanon, Zeid Wehbe, and two other
PLO officials have been holding talks with the rival Christian
leaders since Tuesday. They proposed a team of Arab observers
disengage the warring Christian forces, An-Nahar said.
   The Palestinian team, according to the paper, warned both Geagea
and Aoun that Syria would intervene militarily in the Christian
enclave if the intra-Christian showdown were renewed.
   Syria, which has 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem Lebanese
areas under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab
League, is the major Arab enemy of Aoun, Geagea and Arafat.

inquiry into events relating to the Iran-Contra affair?
   A. No.
   Q. At any time, did you ever approve or give authority to John
Poindexter to destroy any documents or records that related to the
Iran-Contra affair?
   A. No.
   Q. At any time, did you ever approve or give authority to John
Poindexter to destroy any documents or records that related to the
Iran-Contra affair?
   A. No.
   Q. At any time, did John Poindexter ever tell you that he
planned on destroying any documents or records that related to the
Iran-Contra affair?
   A, No.
   Q. At any time, did John Poindexter ever tell you that he
planned on destroying any documents or records that related to the
Iran-Contra affair?
   A. No.
   Q. At any time, did he ever tell you that he had actually
destroyed any records or documents related to the Iran-Contra
affair?
   A. No.
   Q. Did John Poindexter at any time ever tell you that he had
learned that Oliver North in November of 1986 had altered and
destroyed records that related to the Iran-Contra affair?
   A. No.
   Q. ... If you will accept for a moment that it was in the
October of 1984 that Congress _ that that law came into existence
that cut off the funding for the Contras at that time. If you could
go back with me a bit in time, Mr. President, to that time period.
   After October of 1984 and going forward up to November of 1986,
do you recall at any time ever authorizing or approving the
National Security Council accepting the transfer of
responsibilities from the Central Intelligence Agency to continue
to aid the Contras after the passage of (the) Boland (Amendment) in
the same way that the CIA had done before the passage of Boland?
   A. I have no recollection of that.
   Q. Okay. And do you recall, if you can, Mr. President, whether _
do you remember at any time that John Poindexter or anyone else at
the National Security Council ever requested from you permission to
have the National Security Council, in substance, replace the
Central Intelligence Agency and providing aid to the Contras after
Boland shut off the funding coming through the CIA?
   A. I have no recollection of any such thing.
   Q. ... You indicated that you do have an understanding or a
recollection that Oliver North, after the Boland Amendment passed
in October of 1984, that he did have some contact with Contra
leaders; is that correct?
   A. I think it is, yes. There wasn't _ as I say, I had assured
everybody that we would have to abide by the law, but I didn't
think there was anything in the law that prevented us from
remaining in contact with the people that we had been trying to
help and working with.
   Q. I understand. But is it fair to say, Mr. President, is it
true that even though you had an understanding that he had some
contact with the Contras after Boland passed, atno time did you
know or have any indication whatsoever that Oliver L. North was
participating in planning and directing and advising the Contras in
connection with military and paramilitary activities, including
giving logistical support? You had no idea he was doing that, did
you, sir?
   A. No. I guess that I had never _ had never had any inkling that
we were guiding their strategy in any way.

<HEAD>USDA Sess Another Year of Record Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle producers are headed for another year
of record-high market prices, an Agriculture Department analysis
indicated Thursday.
   Total beef production by slaughter plants is expected to rise
about 2 percent because of increased cattle marketings and heavier
weights, the department's Economics Research Service said in its
report.
   But an expanding U.S. population and increases in net beef
exports will more than offset the larger output, the report said.
That will mean less beef available on a per capita basis.
   Consequently, market prices of choice-grade fed steers sold on
the Omaha, Neb., market in 1990 may average about $1 more than last
year's record of $72.50 per pound, the report said. That would push
retail prices up 1 percent to 3 percent.
   Hog prices also are going up and may average in the range of $47
to $53 per 100 pounds in 1990, compared with a little more than $44
last year at the major markets.
   ``Retail pork prices have risen in recent months, reflecting
higher hog prices and wider farm-to-retail (marketing) spreads,''
the report said. ``Retail pork prices for the year may increase 6
percent to 8 percent from last year.''

<HEAD>Labor Federation Urges Renewed Commitment to Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO leaders closed their annual
meeting Thursday with a call for the federation's 14 million
members to send additional financial aid to striking Machinists at
Eastern Airlines.
   ``I don't know if the strike is ever going to be over, because
we're going be to there with them just as long as it takes,'' said
Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees.
   The AFL-CIO's 33-member board declared that the Eastern strike
``remains as solid as ever.'' It asked unions across the country to
``adopt'' groups of Machinists and send money to help their
families.
   The 8,500 Machinists who walked out nearly a year ago inspired
workers nationwide because they've ``been on the front lines of
labor's battle against corporate greed and intransigence,'' the
board said.
   The Eastern situation was a sore spot for labor leaders during a
weeklong meeting otherwise marked by optimism that organized labor
is regaining political and bargaining power after a loss of stature
in the 1980s.
   AFL-CIO leaders were jubilant in announcing Tuesday that the
10-month Pittston coal strike was ending. The Appalachian miners
ratified a contract that gave them victories on health care and job
security.
   In addition, union leaders met with prominent Democrats who are
enlisting their help in the 1990 elections, which will determine
who controls next year's congressional redistricting.
   Union leaders also received a boost with a report showing that
the public's image of the American labor movement is improving.
   ``We've been tempered, I think, by a period of fire and, in the
net result, it's strengthened us,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
said.
   Labor officials attribute much of their improved standing to
efforts on issues that affect all Americans, such as health care.
   In an effort to keep abortion off the week's agenda, the board
named a 14-member panel to study whether the federation should
adopt a pro-choice position.
   When union leaders met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole on
Tuesday, Eastern was the only major point of contention.
   AFL-CIO leaders said their relationship with the White House has
improved since the Reagan era. But the federation said the Bush
administration doesn't care about the survival of Eastern and has
sided with management in the Machinists' strike.
   Kirkland conceded that so far the strike has failed but said
Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., had not won either.
   Labor leaders also acknowledged they lack the votes in Congress
to override President Bush's veto of legislation that would create
a commission to settle the dispute.

   The political outlook may have improved a bit
for the North in new Census population estimates.
   The South and West will wrest away some seats in the House of
Representatives after the 1990 national head count _ but maybe not
as many as had originally been thought.
   The Constitution requires seats in the House to be redistributed
among states after each census.
   The private Population Reference Bureau analyzed a complex
series of new Census estimates on Thursday, and predicted that 14
House seats will move from the Northeast and Midwest to the South
and West after the census.
   Earlier analyses by the same group had indicated as many as 18
seats would move.
   The Census estimates include four sets of possible state
populations for 1990, each differing slightly depending on the
amount of interstate movement by people.
   One set included no movement, and was discounted by the private
analysis group.
   But while reapportionment calculations based on the other three
varied slightly, the overall shift in seats was consistent.
   The big winner will be California, gaining six seats based on
the new figures. The previous calculations had called for
California to gain five seats.
   Texas and Florida will gain three seats each, the new estimates
indicate. Earlier calculations had shown Texas adding four seats
and Florida three.
   Arizona and Georgia, which had previously been expected to gain
two seats apiece, are now expected to add one, the new study said.
   Virginia also will gain one, as had been expected. North
Carolina would add one seat under two of the estimates, but would
remain unchanged under the third.
   On the losing side, New York is still expected to lose three
seats. Pennsylvania, which had been expected to drop three, now
appears likely to lose just two. Ohio, Illinois and Michigan will
drop two each, the same as previously expected.
   Also unchanged are losses of one seat each by West Virginia,
Iowa, Kansas and Massachusetts.
   Wisconsin, which had been expected to lose a seat, would not do
so under the new figures. And Montana would lose a seat under two
estimates but not under the third.
   Following the 1990 census, the Census Bureau will present the
White House with the final state population figures and the new
reapportionment numbers.

   A U.S.-flag Kuwaiti tanker loaded with
naphtha and diesel fuel exploded Thursday in the Persian Gulf and
two American crewmen were believed killed.
   The other 23 seamen, all Americans but one, abandoned the
burning ship and were rescued by a U.S. Navy frigate.
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said remains
had been found in the water but it was not clear whether they were
of one or two people. A U.S. military spokesman said he could not
confirm the report.
   Other American military sources said the two men missing, and
evidently killed, were the captain and first mate of the 81,283-ton
Surf City but further identification would have to come from the
owners, the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. No one at the company was
available for comment Thursday night.
   Capt. Ron Wildermuth, chief spokesman for U.S. Central Command
headquarters in Tampa, Fla., said there were no reports of mines
from the Iran-Iraq war in the area and ``initial reports indicate
the explosion was internal.''
   The Surf City exploded 20 miles off the United Arab Emirates,
said U.S. officials and shipping sources in the gulf.
   ``It was a huge explosion, the ship just blew up,'' said Wayne
Cohen, 27, of Boston, who was standing watch on the bridge.
   He and crewman Earl Washington, from Louisiana, were cut by
flying glass when the pilot house windows shattered, Cohen said.
   ``There was some panic,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``We
made our way to the lifeboat.''
   Both were among survivors picked up by the missile frigate USS
Simpson, and were taken to a hospital in Dubai.
   Cohen, a member of the Surf City crew since September, said he
looked back as the lifeboat reached the Simpson and saw ``nothing
but fire and smoke.''
   Late in the day, the tanker was reported still burning and
taking on water. Wildermuth said U.S. warships and other craft in
the area were ``standing off'' in case of another explosion in the
highly volatile cargo.
   The Surf City was among 11 Kuwaiti tankers given U.S. flags in
1987 so the Navy could protect them from Iran, which had made
Kuwait's merchant fleet a target because it supported Iraq in the
war.
   In 1987-88, the Surf City made dozens of trips unscathed under
U.S. escort. No armed attacks or minings have been reported in the
gulf since Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire in August 1988.
   An Iranian Silkworm missile badly damaged a sister tanker, the
Sea Isle City, at Kuwait's main loading terminal Oct. 19, 1987. Two
months earlier, the reflagged supertanker Bridgeton struck an
Iranian mine on the Navy's first convoy up the gulf.
   Direct escort ended five months after the truce, but U.S. Navy
ships still monitor the movements of U.S.-flag tankers.
   Thursday's explosion occurred as the Surf City was sailing out
of the gulf through one of its busiest shipping lanes, between the
United Arab Emirates and Abu Musa, an Iranian island.
   Cohen said some work was being done on one of the ship's
starboard cargo tanks about midway down the 700-foot deck, where
the explosion occurred. He said the missing men were in the area.
   The Simpson, on patrol three miles away, was observing the Surf
City visually and on radar, officials said. The missile destroyer
USS Dewey, another of the 10 U.S. warships on duty in the gulf,
also went to the scene, as did several patrol craft and helicopters
from the Emirates.
   A statement from the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said the fire spread
quickly from the blast point toward the stern, where the engine
room, bridge and crew's quarters are located.
   It said the tanker was listing and salvage tugs were trying to
recover it. Shipping executives said the tugs were forced to stay
clear because of the fire.
   When the ships were put under the American flag in 1987, an
exception to U.S. maritime law was made that let them sail with
foreign rather than exclusively American crews.
   That changed a year ago, when six of the ships were removed from
U.S. registry. The United States extended the contract for the
other five, including the Surf City, on condition they use American
crews.
   Central Command officials said they could not explain why the
Surf City carried a ``British-Canadian'' chief engineer.

   Q. If he did that, you never knew about it?
   A. No.
   Q. Mr. President, did you ever authorize Oliver North or the
National Security Council to use Richard Secord or Albert Hakim to
assist in providing financial and military support for the Contras?
   A. No. I had heard reports about them in connection with some of
the private groups that were trying to reach the Contras with aid
and so forth. I knew very little about either one of them or _ but
I had heard their names connected with such things.
   Q. ... Do you recall an incident occurring involving a pilot
named Gene Hasenfus that was shot down over Nicaragua carrying arms
to the Contras?
   A. I have a memory of a plane that was shot down, and that one
of the people who turned out unhurt but all right was an American
citizen. And I had no knowledge that he was involved in any way,
nor do I recall his indicating that he was in _ of having anything
to do with the government and our program, but there he was and,
apparently, a prisoner.
   Q. And my question to you is: Do you recall who the first person
was in government who told you that Gene Hasenfus, who was shot
down over Nicaragua, had no connection to the United States
government or the National Security Council? Do you know who told
you that?
   A. I do not recall who told me that, but that was the
information that I had.
   Q. ... As I understand your statement under oath in the
interrogatories, which I believe you accept as a truthful
statement, Admiral Poindexter assured you that the Hasenfus
operation had no connection to the United States government
whatsoever. Is that what you state there?
   A. Yes. And I opened that statement with saying to the best of
my knowledge I first learned of the Hasenfus crash from Admiral
Poindexter.
   Q. I understand. And you gave a date there that you believe you
learned it on October 7, 1986; is that correct?
   A. Well, let me find that. October 7, '86, yes.
   Q. And you go on to say under oath in your interrogatory that
when Poindexter told you that Hasenfus had no connection to the
United States government whatsoever, you go on to say, ``When I
asked whether John Singlaub might be involved in this operation, as
had been reported in the press, I was told no by Admiral
Poindexter.'' Do you say that?
   A. Yes.
   Q. Mr. President, when your Tower Commission reported back to
you in March of 1987, did the Tower Commission not tell you, Mr.
President, Oliver North and your National Security Council were
involved in 1985 and 1986 in assisting the Contras militarily and
paramilitarily? Do you recall that being told to you by your Tower
Commission?
   A. I don't recall that, and I can only tell you _
   Q. I will try to _
   A. _ that my interest in that commission was to find out the
thing that I still do not know, and that was how did there turn out
to be more money than the 12.2 million for the TOW tank missiles,
who delivered and who _ obviously, it seemed to me that someone
must have raised the price for those, but that was never found out.
I still do not know.
   And then to talk as they do about a diversion of money that was
found in that Swiss bank account, I have no information at all that
there was ever any more money than was in the account when it was
found, or that any diversion to anyone had been attempted of that
money ...
   Judge Greene: ... The letter from Mr. McFarlane (to Congress)
apparently indicates that no effort has been made or will be made
to provide military or paramilitary _ support for military or
paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. The Tower Commission report
appears to indicate that Col. North did make expenditures for
Contra military equipment, supplies, and so on.
   Do you find that the two are consistent with each other, or if
they are inconsistent, do you find that the second one brands the
first one as a falsehood?
   I think that is what he is trying to find out.
   A. Well, I have to say there's _ in the wording of all of this,
possibly there is a _ it could be int interpreted that other way. I
had not because I am remembering my telling those same people to be
helpful to private citizens who were trying to do something that
the Congress of the United States refused to do and abandoning its
responsibility.
   Q. Mr. President, in connection with your statement or testimony
that as you looked at McFarlane's letter to Congressman Barnes, as
you looked at it this morning and said that it looked okay to you,
did you consider and do you remember that Mr. McFarlane, the man
who sent the letter, has pled guilty in open court to withholding
information from Congress in connection with that letter?
   A. No, I was not aware of that.
   Q. ... Is it fair to say that as the year 1986 went on, you were
generally aware that there were some shipments of weapons to Iran
under the finding that you signed on January 17th, but you don't _
but you, yourself, are not aware of the underlying operational
details?
   A. No, I am not.
   Q. ... One of the things, am I correct, that you did not ever
know about and were never advised of is that the iranians were
being charged a price substantially in excess of the price that the
United States was receiving for the weapons; is that correct? You
were never aware of that?
   A. No. That is the thing that I have been talking about for a
long time that I am still waiting to find out, who raised the price
on them.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration opposes placing more
economic sanctions on South Africa because, ``When someone is
starting to do the right thing, you don't kick them,'' an official
said Thursday.
   Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, predicted South Africa's white-ruled government might be
able to satisfy conditions that could lead to the removal of U.S.
economic sanctions ``in the next three months.''
   ``In my opinion, the end of officially sanctioned racial
oppression in South Africa is on the horizon,'' he said during an
appearance before two House subcommittees. ``This is the beginning
of an exciting new phase that will determine the shape of a
non-racial, democratic South Africa.''
   But Cohen said the Bush administration objects to a House
resolution that would tighten the sanctions by preventing U.S.
banks from rescheduling South African debt.
   He said you don't ``kick'' people when they're on the right path
to reform.
   Cohen's comments came as a bipartisan congressional group
pledged to keep sanctions in force until South Africa's President
F.W. de Klerk meets all conditions for the lifting of sanctions.
   Congress imposed the sanctions in 1986 over the veto of
then-President Reagan. The sanctions spell out specific things the
South African government must do in order for Washington to remove
them.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who co-sponsored a companion measure to
the House resolution, said the bill's backers were ``mindful of the
real progress being made in South Africa. We also recognize that it
is only a beginning.''
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said ``As we celebrate the release
of Nelson Mandela, the personification of the struggle against
white minority rule in south Africa, this resolution keeps up
focused on the goal for which he has sacrificed so much: total
dismantling of apartheid and the creation of a genuine non-racial
democracy in South Africa.''
   De Klerk has released from prison Nelson Mandela, head of the
African National Congress, and lifted the bans of the ANC and other
black political organizations.
   Several Republicans endorsed the resolution, including Sens.
Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.

   Q. Now, at any time prior to November of 1986 while the Iranian
initiative was going on, do you recall any conversation with your
National Security Adviser John Poindexter in which he in any way
hinted or suggested or in any way told you anything about these
excess profits and the diversion to the Contras?
   A. There was never any such conversation because the only
information we had was that there was money in excess over the 12.2
million that had been deposited in a Swiss bank account.
   Q. Let me see if I can help refresh your memory from your Tower
Commission, what they told you. ... Do you see there the portion

   A. I have just seen it, and I have to tell you to my

This report _ this is the first time that I have ever seen a

   Q. My question is: If he (Poindexter) knew about it, you would

<HEAD>White House, Governors Oppose Increasing Unemployment Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration Thursday said it
opposed a House bill that would increase taxes on employers to
protect the jobless from a sudden cut in unemployment benefits in a
severe recession.
   The National Governors' Association said it also objected to the
bill, which would raise the federal unemployment insurance taxable
wage base from $7,000 to $10,000.
   The bill by Reps. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.; Donald Pease, D-Ohio,
and Sander Levin, D-Mich., is aimed at averting a repeat of the
1981-82 recession when cash-starved states cut benefits and
restricted eligibility as their jobless rates soared above 10
percent.
   ``We see no programatic justification for such an increase,''
Deputy Assistant Labor Secretary Carolyn Golding told the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources, which is chaired by
Downey.
   Ms. Golding said the Unemployment Trust Funds now have state and
federal reserves totaling $45 billion. She said one state,
Michigan, still owes $800 million from the $14 billion borrowed by
26 states in 1982-84 to meet benefit payments.
   ``Some states remain in positions that could require borrowing
if such a downturn occurred,'' Ms. Golding said, but ``there has
been significant overall improvement in the solvency of the trust
funds.''
   Despite the improvement, congressional auditors in the General
Accounting Office said Thursday the reserves ``still appear to be
inadequate to handle a severe recession.''
   At the end of 1989, only six states had enough reserves to
maintain benefits in a severe recession for 18 months, the target
recommended in the past by the Labor Department and most state
employment security administrators, the GAO said.
   And the overall system has only 11 months of recession-level
benefits in reserve, compared with a 22-month reserve two decades
ago, the auditors said.
   Congress' decision in 1982 to make states pay interest on money
they borrowed to maintain benefits has made the system more
solvent, the GAO said, but at a cost of higher unemployement
insurance taxes and reduced eligibility.
   But Ohio Employment Services Administrator Ellen O'Brien told
the hearing that instead of increasing taxes, the government should
redivide the tax pie so states get a bigger share.
   ``Employers who finance this system through the Federal
Unemployment Tax Act are investing enough money to provide adequate
service,'' she said. ``No new taxes are necessary to return the
program to its proper funding level.''
   As the program now works, most covered employers pay into the
system a minimum gross tax of 6.2 percent on the first $7,000 in
annual wages to a worker on their payroll.
   That tax rate would fall to 6 percent at the end of this year.
   Of the $436 now collected each year per worker, $56 goes to the
federal government and the other $380 goes to the states, which
adjust the actual tax rates on each employer according to the
firm's unemployment experience.
   Thirty-six states have adopted floors above the mandated $7,000
level, ranging from $7,100 in Connecticut up to $20,900 in Alaska.

<HEAD>Youth Facing Possible Death Sentence Asks High Court For Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for an Alabama youth facing a possible
death sentence in his home state asked the Supreme Court on
Thursday to overrule the District of Columbia court that ordered
his extradition.
   Gerald Fisher, attorney for the 17-year-old boy who has been
identified in court proceedings by the initials O.M., said the
petition for Supreme Court review automatically will postpone the
District of Columbia court order approving his extradition until
the high court decides whether to hear the case.
   O.M. is charged with arson and murder in the death of
14-month-old Tamal Jackson, who was killed in the May 1988
firebombing of an apartment in a Gadsden, Ala., housing project. If
returned to Alabama and certified for trial as an adult, he could
face the death penalty.
   Two uncles of O.M., 32-year-old Yul Devoe Guice, and an
18-year-old identified only by the initials S.T., also face arson
and murder charges in the same case. Guice is being held in an
Alabama prison on an unrelated charge and S.T. is being held by
District of Columbia authorities.
   S.T. also is fighting extradition to Alabama, but his case has
been put on hold by District of Columbia court officials until the
final disposition of the O.M. case.
   O.M., who is black, has attracted widespread attention in his
long fight to avoid extradition because of his contention that he
cannot get a fair trial from the predominantly white judicial
system in Etowah County, Ala., where his father and another
relative died while in police custody.

<TEXT>
   A small-town jury Thursday acquitted
a record store owner of obscenity charges for selling a sexually
explicit tape by a rap group.
   The Circuit Court jury took less than 1{ hours to decide in
favor of Tommy Hammond, who earlier was found guilty in Municipal
Court in what the American Civil Liberties Union called the
nation's first obscenity conviction for music. Hammond had appealed
that conviction and was granted a trial in the higher court.
   He was charged with violating a 1983 city ordinance against
obscenity for selling ``Move Somethin''' by the group 2 Live Crew.
The ordinance carries a fine of $500.
   The group records on the Skyywalker label, which paid half
Hammond's legal fees in the first round of the legal fight in
Alexander City, a town of about 14,000.
   Judge James Avery told jurors their verdict ``certainly will
help people in the future on how to approach this type of thing _
in other cities in Alabama and across the nation. ... You've taken
part in a historic case.''
   Scattered applause broke out in the courtroom after the verdict
was announced.
   Hammond said he expected to be found innocent.
   ``When you start messing with First Amendment rights, you ought
to be protected. People in this community feel that way,'' he said.
   During the four-day trial, jurors listened to the tape's
street-language lyrics, which include explicit lines about oral and
anal sex and sadomasochism.
   At issue was whether the tape, which has sold more than 1
million copies, violates accepted community standards _ part of the
doctrine laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1970s.
   Juror Eddie Futral said the 2 Live Crew tape wasn't any more
offensive than other music, videotapes or magazines that are
available in Alexander City and were introduced as evidence by the
defense.
   ``When they showed all the things that were tolerated in the
city at the time, I couldn't see any difference between them,''
Futral said.
   Defense attorney Bobby Segall had urged jurors to protect ``the
freedom of every citizen of Alabama _ the right to say that which
is unsayable.''
   ``Where in the world do you draw the line on what obscenity
is?'' he asked.
   He said the Eddie Murphy movie ``Raw'' is as sexually explicit
as the tape and that the movie had been shown at a theater in town.
   ``If you want obscenity stopped, you can stop it,'' prosecutor
Danny Brown said in closing arguments. ``There is no question he
knew the nature and character of that work. ... It exhibits a total
disregard for women.''
   Police Chief Lynn Royall testified that he listened to less than
a minute of the tape before deeming it obscene and authorizing
Hammond's arrest. He said he was concerned about the music's effect
on teen-agers.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the center-left Labor Party on
Thursday threatened to quit Israel's coalition government unless
the Cabinet adopts compromises within two weeks aimed at starting
an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   The 107-member Labor Bureau passed a resolution saying ``there
is a need for an immediate decision on issues that will ensure the
continuation of the peace process and a further delay will cause
serious harm to Israel.''
   It added: ``The ... condition for the continuation of the
National Unity government is the continuation of the peace
process.''
   Cabinet approval of the compromises, which would mean allowing
deported Palestinians and east Jerusalem residents to participate
in peace talks, would require Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
bloc to drop its opposition to the moves.
   Disagreements over the peace process have threatened to break up
the Likud-Labor partnership at least four times, but Thursday's
resolution was the strongest by Labor since formation of the
government in December 1988.
   It comes at a time when Shamir faces a potential split in his
own party over demands by hard-liners that he rule out any
compromise in the peace process.
   Shamir's chief Likud rival, Ariel Sharon, who quit as trade
minister four days ago over disagreements on peace moves, urged the
prime minister to unite against any compromise.
   ``Shamir should reject the Labor ultimatum immediately,'' he
said.
   Shamir, interviewed on Israel television, said he never received
any ultimatum and added: ``We will discuss every issue in its own
time and hour as is obligated.''
   The Likud faction in Parliament issued a statement rejecting the
Labor threat, saying ``the fate of the nation or foreign policy
will not be determined with a stopwatch,'' Israel TV reported.
   Labor's move came after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
party's No. 2 man, eased his demand that Labor remain in the
Likud-led coalition.
   He told Israel army radio he changed his mind after Egypt, which
has been representing the Palestine Liberation Organization in
U.S.-brokered peace efforts, gave ``reasonable answers'' on the
makeup of a Palestinian peace delegation and the agenda for a
dialogue.
   Rabin denied Labor's move was an ultimatum, but he also said
Egypt's answers could put Israel in the role of holding up the
peace process.
   ``If the delay comes from here, there is doubt whether there is
a point in the continuation of the government,'' he said.
   The resolution was adopted unanimously by the Labor Bureau,
which runs the party's day-to-day affairs, at a meeting in Tel
Aviv. It calls for Labor's government ministers to bring the
compromise steps to a Cabinet vote within two weeks.
   Rabin and Labor's leader, Vice Premier Shimon Peres, disagreed
on when the party should consider quitting the government.
   Rabin said the Cabinet could hold more than one meeting on the
issue, but Peres it would be ``the end of the story'' if a Cabinet
vote was not taken by March 7.
   The party has scheduled a meeting on March 15 for its
1,300-member Central Committee to consider the party's continuation
in the government.
   The compromises that Labor wants are part of U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III's effort to revive Israel's stalled plan
for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Baker has urged an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue to help set up
the elections, which would lead to limited autonomy for the
territories and later talks on their final status.
   The compromises call for Palestinians in the initial talks to
include six residents of the occupied lands, two deportees brought
back from exile and two residents of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem
who have other homes in the territories. The talks would focus on
the elections but could include opening statements on other issues.
   The compromise is intended to satisfy PLO demands to include
overseas Palestinians, while recognizing Israel's insistence that
it will only negotiate with residents of the occupied lands.
   Environment Minister Ronnie Milo, a confidant of Shamir,
repeated Likud's opposition to the compromises. ``Deportees and
east Jerusalem Arabs, this is something that is not included in the
initiative of the Israeli government,'' Milo told army radio.
   Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem after it was captured from
Jordan along with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War.

Security</HEAD>

   The spread of ballistic missiles and other
modern weaponry in the Third World poses a growing threat to U.S.
security, the Navy's top officer told Congress Thursday.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations, said that
while a lowering of superpower tensions made global warfare less
likely in the 1990s, U.S. armed forces will be challenged to
protect American security in ``an era of violent peace.''
   ``There was a time when conflict in developing countries
conjured a vision of simple, low-tech warfare that would not
require sophisticated weapons. That time has passed,'' Trost told
the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense.
   ``Today, around the globe, developing countries are armed with
`First World' weapons,'' he said, and as a result ``virtually any
nation or group of terrorists can bring capable and deadly weapons
to bear.''
   Thus the United States should remain able to project its naval
power worldwide, he said.
   In pleading with Congress to avoid big cuts in Navy manpower and
weapons programs, Trost sounded a theme that lawmakers have heard
from all service branches in recent weeks. The Bush administration
has proposed trimming the defense budget next year by about 2
percent, after inflation, but momentum is building in Congress to
cut much more deeply in response to the waning of the Cold War.
   Trost acknowledged that ``perhaps we are at the end of the Cold
War.'' But he stressed that a well-equipped military still was
needed to handle hostilities in the Third World.
   Trost said 102 countries in addition to the United States and
the Soviet Union now have cruise missiles. By the year 2000, at
least 15 countries will be producing their own ballistic missiles,
he said.
   Trost also said 14 countries besides the two superpowers have
chemical weapons and 11 are suspected of developing them. He said
three countries besides the superpowers have bacteriological
weapons and 15 may be developing them.

<HEAD>Administration Wants Protections for Disabled Made Part of Civil

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's opposition to a new
civil rights bill has forced officials to seek changes in another
bill that specifically protects the rights of the nation's 43
million disabled people.
   The issue, centering on how to punish employment discrimination,
arose Thursday during testimony by an administration official
before a House committee reviewing the proposed Americans With
Disabilities Act.
   The proposed disabilities law would guarantee the rights of
disabled people to employment, goods and services. A version that
was passed by the Senate last September was a delicate compromise
that had been negotiated with the White House.
   The administration, however, opposes a more recently submitted
bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1990. That bill would give more
enforcement clout to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by making it
possible to seek compensatory and punitive damages for employment
discrimination.
   ``Enactment of this proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990 would
significantly expand the remedies available under the ADA to
include compensatory and punitive damages,'' James P. Turner,
acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, told the House
Small Business Committee.
   Turner said the administration has opposed including
compensatory and punitive damages in the disabilities act just as
it has in other civil rights legislation.
   ``Inclusion of such extraordinary relief as punitive damages is
simply unwarranted in a statutory scheme as new, bold and complex
as the provision of disabilities rights concepts to the American
business community,'' he said.
   Turner proposed that the disabilities bill instead outline
specific sanctions without reference to the broader Civil Rights
Act. He said he was not trying to hold the disabilities bill
``hostage'' but instead was trying to speed up its passage in view
of the anticipated fight against the 1990 civil rights act.
   The administration proposal is anathema to advocates of the
disabilities bill, who reject any effort to give the disabled civil
rights protection that differs from the protection afforded to
blacks, other minorities and women.
   ``We cannot understand why the Bush administration would oppose
monetary damages for victims of intentional discrimination,'' said
Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, a coalition of 185 rights groups.
   ``And we are incredulous that the administration would be
willing to treat persons with disabilities differently from other
victims of intentional discrimination,'' Neas said.

   The government posted its first monthly budget
surplus of fiscal 1990 in January, but the federal deficit after
four months still totaled nearly 60 percent of the amount permitted
for the entire year.
   Despite January's $9.92 billion surplus, the deficit for the
first four months of the fiscal year totaled $59.78 billion, the
Treasury said Thursday. The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
limits the fiscal 1990 imbalance to $100 billion.
   The deficit last year was $152.1 billion.
   The 1990 deficit through January was 7.7 percent lower than that
for the first four months of fiscal 1989. January's surplus
contrasted with a $14.6 billion imbalance during December.
   Much of the surplus was due to a surge in revenue from
individual income tax collections. However, the surplus also was
inflated artificially by S&amp;L bailout borrowing.
   The Treasury reported that individual tax receipts in January
totaled $56.04 billion, up 50 percent from December collections.
Individual income tax receipts are expected to remain high through
the April 15 deadline for filing 1989 returns.
   Receipts were inflated in January by $5 billion borrowed through
a special off-budget agency called the Resolution Funding Corp.
Normally, government borrowing does not count as revenue.
   Overall receipts totaled $99.54 billion in January, up 11.5
percent from January 1989. Outlays were $89.62 billion, a 3.6
percent increase over the same month a year ago. The deficit is the
difference between revenue and spending.
   So far this fiscal year, receipts totaled $328.3 billion, up 5.6
percent from the first four months of fiscal 1989. Outlays totaled
$388.1 billion, up 3.3 percent from the October-January period of
fiscal 1989.
   As usual, the biggest spending categores were for the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $21.1 billion in January and $92.6
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.8 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $19 billion last month and
$78.5 billion for the year. It is projected to total $224.6 billion
for the year.
   Other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$16.2 billion in January and 59.7 for the year. It is projected to
total $191.2 billion for the year.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $16.8 billion in January
and $94.4 billion for the year. It is projected to total $254.9
billion for the year.

   During his videotaped deposition, former
President Reagan had trouble recalling who was chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1985.
   Asked about a 1985 report on a Central American trip made by
Army Gen. John Vessey, Reagan was asked to explain who Vessey was.
   ``Oh dear,'' Reagan said. ``I could ask for help here. The name
I know is very familiar.''
   Richard Beckler, defense attorney for Reagan's former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter, offered a hint, telling the
former president the memo ``is in connection with a trip by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.''
   ``Well, that _ I don't _ I don't think this was my military
aide, but obviously he was in a positioin to do this if he was the
chief of staff,'' Reagan replied.
   Vessey was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from June 1982
to September 1985.
   After reading the report, Reagan determined that the memo was
from Vessey to then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger about
discussions with Honduran officials.

   The two Germanys should reduce their combined
military by two-thirds when they unite, and some U.S. and Soviet
soldiers should remain during the unification process, the East
German defense minister said Thursday.
   Adm. Theodor Hoffmann said the armed forces should be purely
defensive and both states should remain in their respective
alliances until they are reunited under a new European security
system.
   West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany is in the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. About 380,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed
in East Germany and NATO has more than 300,000 in West Germany,
including about 250,000 Americans.
   Hoffmann said a joint German military should be reduced to about
300,000 men initially, and later to 150,000-200,000.
   All three services _ army, navy and air force _ should be
retained because all are essential to defense, he told a news
conference.
   Gen. Hans Deim, East Germany's delegate to Vienna talks on
reduction of conventional forces, told the reporters anything over
300,000 men ``would cause security concerns of our neighbors,
especially France and Poland.''
   West Germany has 490,000 military personnel and East Germany
says its armed forces have shrunk from 170,000 men to 100,000 in
recent months.
   Until a new European system supplants NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
Hoffman said, U.S. and Soviet soldiers should remain on German
territory ``even if this becomes symbolic at a certain time.''
   The United States and Soviet Union have agreed to reduce their
troop strength in central Europe to 195,000 each. Most of the
reductions will be made in Germany.
   Keeping some U.S. and Soviet troops until unification under a
new security system would preserve stability in Europe, Hoffmann
said, and described fears of a hasty union as justified.
   ``Although unification is unstoppable, it is going faster than
the process of uniting all of Europe'' and Europeans have
``legitimate security concerns'' about it, the defense minister
said.
   ``Our neighbors have had bitter experiences with a united
Germany,'' he added, recalling the two world wars of this century.
   Talks with the West German military on merging forces could
begin soon after East Germany's first free elections are held March
18 and a new government is formed, Hoffmann said.
   The victorious World War II Allies _ the United States, Soviet
Union, Britain and France _ have agreed on a two-stage plan for
reunification.
   After talks between the Germanys on merging their political,
economic and legal systems, the four powers are to join them for
discussions of the international ramifications.
   Some Europeans worry about the formula, called ``two plus four''
and Poland wants a peace treaty guaranteeing its borders. On
Thursday, Britain expressed support for the Polish demand.
   Poland also has demanded a role in the ``two plus four'' talks,
and on Thursday, government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer repeated East
Germany's agreement.
   One-third of what is now Poland belonged to Germany before World
War II and the Poles are concerned about possible German
territorial claims.
   In West Germany, ZDF television quoted government spokesman
Dieter Vogel as saying only the government of a united Germany
could give Poland a guarantee of its borders. He said Poland would
be consulted during the ``two plus four'' negotiations.
   Hoffmann explained the East German military proposals just
before Helmut Kohl, the West German chancellor, visits the United
States for weekend talks with President Bush on reunification.
   Moscow insists that a united Germany be neutral, but the United
States and the Western allies want it in NATO. West German
officials have proposed membership in the Western alliance, with no
NATO troops stationed in what now is East Germany.
   The East Germans announced plans Thursday for a law that would
permit broad private ownership of industry and allow former owners
to regain companies nationalized by the Communist government ousted
last year.
   It reassured citizens there would be no food prices increases
before the elections and said emergency action was being taken to
ensure adequate supplies.
   Manfred Flegel, minister of trade and supply, said the
announcement of plans to abolish food subsidies had caused a
fourfold increase in the demand for staples.
   Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a West German newspaper, said Premier Hans
Modrow would not run in the East German election but Andre Brie,
campaign manager for the re-named Communist Party, said no decision
had been made.
   Modrow is a reform-minded Communist who became premier in
December. East Germany's Communists now call themselves the Party
of Democratic Socialism.

   President Bush promised Thursday to help find
ways ``to restore common sense and fairness'' to the medical
malpractice system, and urged physicians to provide more free care
for the needy.
   Bush made the twin promise and appeal in a speech at the
centennial celebration of one of America's premier medical schools,
the Johns Hopkins University.
   Despite devoting more than 11 percent of its Gross National
Product to health care _ the biggest share of any country _
``American medicine still faces unprecedented problems,'' Bush said.
   He enumerated some of the maladies: medical malpractice, the
plight of the 37 million Americans with no health insurance, the
AIDS epidemic, drug addiction, an aging population and other
conditions with ``staggering'' costs.
   Despite spending $600 billion a year on health care, the United
States trails other industrialized countries in life expectancy and
ranks 22nd in the developed world in infant mortality, the
president said.
   Bush noted that he had instructed Health Secretary Louis
Sullivan ``to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of options on
the accessibility, cost and quality of America's health-care system.
   ``This administration is committed to health-care policies that
improve health-care quality while restraining costs,'' said Bush.
   Some faculty and students were staging a protest against Bush's
being awarded an honorary doctorate of human letters from Hopkins.
   Several hundred students and others gathered outside the hall
where bush was speaking to protest the honorary degree. They
chanted ``Health Not Stealth,'' and ``George Bush Go Away.''
   David Dafashay, a 19-year-old sophomore from Williamsburg, Va.,
carried a sign reading, ``Dr. Bush? Get Real.''
   ``He spends no money on housing for the poor and no money on a
national health-care plan. ... It's ridiculous,'' Dafashay said.
   On Wednesday, Dr. Philip Zieve, chief physician of the Francis
Scott Key Medical Center, charged the Bush administration with
paying ``lip service'' to human needs while doing ``almost nothing
to deal with the problems of homelessness and very little to deal
with the problems of AIDS.''
   Inside, Bush was joined on stage by more than two dozen eminent
scientists also honored by the university, including two Nobel
Prize winners. He joked that he didn't understand half the words in
their citations, but felt like the youth who put a rope around his
mongrel and brought him to a pet show at Madison Square Garden. The
lad didn't expect to win, Bush said, but knew he'd be in some
``fine company.''
   As for his administration's efforts to make ``better, more
affordable health care ... more accessible,'' he said that
heightened efforts to reduce infant mortality and expanded Medicaid
eligibility for women and infants ``are just two of the steps we
are taking to help.''
   He said his administration is also proposing the largest
biomedical research budget and the largest overall research budget
in U.S. history.
   Bush has proposed a $7.9 billion budget for the next fiscal year
for the National Institutes of Health, a $300 million increase over
this year.
   ``To keep American medicine the best in the world, individual
health care professionals and institutions must make our medical
system responsive and responsible,'' said Bush, urging the
physicians to apply ``fiscal discipline'' to their own rising fees.
   ``And I ask you, today, to avoid the understandable urge to
practice `defensive medicine' where doctors fearing litigation too
often dictate treatment that is unnecessary,'' he said.
   ``We've got to restore common sense and fairness to America's
medical malpractice system,'' Bush said. ``I have directed the
Domestic Policy Council to determine steps the federal government
can take to help alleviate this serious situation.''
   He said Americans must ``remember a simple truth: Not every
unfortunate medical outcome is the result of poor medicine. You
cannot make life risk-free.''
   Bush said the fear of malpractice ``has not only hurt medical
innovation and treatment. It's also hurt medical volunteerism.''
   He reminded his audience, ``Many doctors used to give a day a
week to the needy. And I'm convinced that, if not for the liability
issue, many more would donate time today.''
   He said the medical community has a special responsibility ``to
reach out to those most in need.''
   Hopkins receives more federal research money than any other
university, in excess of $500 million a year, including $175
million for biomedical research alone.

   President Bush's proposal to slow the growth
of Medicare by $5.5 billion next year would hit hospitals too hard
and should be rejected, according to letters released Thursday
signed by a majority of the House and Senate.
   The overwhelming opposition means that the single biggest piece
of deficit reduction in the president's fiscal 1991 budget is in
serious jeopardy.
   The protest letters were not much of a surprise. Congress has
been reluctant in recent years to make deep cuts in Medicare, which
helps 33 million elderly and disabled people pay hospital and
doctors' bills.
   Signed by members of both parties and sent to the House and
Senate budget committees, the two letters complained that hospitals
are already under financial pressures.
   ``Cuts in the Medicare program of the magnitude that the
president is proposing can only make the situation worse and will
pose a real threat to health care for the elderly and disabled,''
said a letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn., signed by 51 senators.
   A similar letter from 227 of the 435 House members to House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said Bush's plan
``threatens to diminish both access to and quality of care.''
   Medicare is one of the fastest-growing federal programs. It is
expected to cost $104 billion this year _ about one-twelfth of the
entire federal budget _ and grow to $183 billion by 1995.
   In recent years, lawmakers searching for ways to reduce the
budget deficit have responded to pressures from hospitals, doctors
and elderly constituents and been reluctant to make deep Medicare
cuts.
   Last year, Bush proposed restraining Medicare spending by $5
billion. Congress eventually approved $2.8 billion in savings.
   Of the $37 billion in deficit cuts the president proposed in the
1991 budget he released last month, the largest piece was the $5.5
billion in reduced Medicare spending.

   A priest forced into exile by Nicolae
Ceausescu said Thursday he is being followed by agents of the
ousted dictator's Securitate secret police, which the new
government has said it disbanded.
   Dozens of uniformed police guarded government headquarters
Thursday, a day before the ruling Provisional Council of National
Unity was to discuss a proposed decree giving the military more
power to control demonstrations.
   A double row of soldiers in green uniforms formed a semicircle
around the muddy front lawn and signs told pedestrians not to
loiter. Fifteen armored personnel carriers were parked in front of
the building.
   An anti-government crowd stormed and ransacked the headquarters
Sunday while soldiers stood aside. They said they had orders not to
shoot at protesters.
   Rumors had circulated that citizens unhappy with the interim
government would protest in Victory Square, outside the
headquarters, to mark two months since Ceausescu was overthrown
Dec. 22 after 24 years in power. He was executed three days later.
   State television broadcast scenes of street protests that helped
bring down the Communist dictator.
   More than 400 people demonstrated Thursday in Timisoara, the
western city where the revolt began, for more democracy and closer
ties with Western Europe, a participant reported.
   He said demonstrators also condemned the pace of the
investigation into the assault by security forces on unarmed
protesters in Timisoara that started the uprising.
   Police confirmed a demonstration had taken place but would not
give details.
   The Rev. Gheorghe Calciu Dumitreasa, 64, a Romanian Orthodox
priest and human rights activist, told a news conference he had
been ``followed around by agents of the Securitate,'' Ceausescu's
hated secret police.
   He accused the National Salvation Front, which dominates the
ruling Provisional Council of National Unity, of trying to impede
his humanitarian mission ``because they are not democratic and
still oppress the people.''
   ``On Monday, the Front tried to lie about my visit here, saying
I was here for political reasons,'' he said.
   Calciu accused the Front of spreading the ``disinformation''
that a Mass he intends to celebrate Friday in Bucharest's central
University Square on Friday ``is in fact a political
demonstration.''
   ``The Front is afraid because they are not honest men; otherwise
I wouldn't be watched by the Securitate,'' he said.
   Calciu, spiritual leader of the Romanian World Congress and a
priest at Holy Cross Church in Alexandria, Va., also recommended a
purge of ``compromised religious authorities ... to give the church
back its dignity.''
   His reference was to clerics who collaborated with Ceausescu,
who discouraged religious practice. Calciu was imprisoned by
Communist regimes for 21 years, in 1948-64 and 1979-84, then
expelled in 1985. He said he intends to return to Romania
permanently.
   The provisional government said recently it had disbanded the
Securitate.
   In Washington, Minister of State Dumitru Mazilu of Romania said
he was seeking $500 million in aid from the United States, in
addition to gifts of food.
   During his recent trip to Romania, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III offered $80 million, including 500,000 tons of feed grain
and 7,500 tons of butter.
   Mazilu said that was ``so small for our desperate situation; we
need much more.''
   Also Thursday, a dispatch from the official news agency Rompres
denied that the killing Feb. 8 in Rosiori village of a member of
the National Peasants Party was politically motivated. On
Wednesday, the party spokesman in Bucharest said Vasile Velescu, a
farmer, was the victim of a political murder.
   Rompres quoted police and a local prosecutor as saying Velescu
was beaten to death ``with fists and feet'' by two young men with
whom he had quarreled.
   Representatives of 12 ethnic minorities in Romania met with Vice
President Carol Koraly to ask for guarantees of minority rights and
reopening of schools in the Turkish, Serbian and Bulgarian
languages. Koraly described the meeting as positive, but gave no
details.

<HEAD>Tornadoes In Southeast; Flood Threat Across East, Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tornados touched down Thursday in Mississippi, Alabama and
Georgia as a powerful storm surged through the Southeast. Heavy
rain threatened floods from Florida to Michigan.
   The twisters and accompanying thunderstorms damaged dozens of
homes and left at least 15 people injured.
   The first two tornadoes touched down just after midnight in Pass
Christian, Miss., on the Gulf Coast about 25 miles west of Biloxi.
At least 30 homes were damaged, but no injuries were reported.
   Over the next several hours, heavy rain flooded two dozen homes
and washed out a bridge in Hattiesburg, Miss., forcing the closure
of about 40 streets. A tornado touched down just before dawn at
Opp, Ala., injuring about 10 people and toppling trees and power
lines throughout the town.
   As the storm moved northeastward, it left a path of destruction
across several rural Alabama counties. Altogether, at least 15
people were injured in Alabama.
   Shortly after 9 a.m., a tornado touched down at Columbus, Ga.
There were no reports of injuries or major damage.
   Thunderstorm winds were clocked at 74 mph at Auburn, Ala., and
76 mph at Dothan. There were almost two dozen reports of damage
from thunderstorm wind gusts across east central and southeast
Alabama and west-central and northern Georgia.
   Heavy rains threatened floods elsewhere.
   Flood watches were posted for the southern half of lower
Michigan and northern Indiana, as well as the mountains and
foothills of North Carolina, northern Georgia, eastern Alabama and
northwest Florida.
   Flood watches were also out for the northern third of Ohio,
northwestern South Carolina, southern Vermont and portions of upper
New York state.
   Two inches of rain fell at Fort Wayne, Ind., early Thursday,
causing several streams in northeastern Indiana to overflow their
banks.
   At noon, rainshowers and occasional thunderstorms extended from
Florida, Georgia and Alabama into western South Carolina and North
Carolina. Rain also reached across western and central Virginia,
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, southern lower
Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and from Missouri and southeast Kansas
through Oklahoma.
   Snow was falling over northern lower Michigan, southern
Wisconsin and east-central Iowa.
   Fog with occasional rain extended across the Pacific Northwest.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at noon included 1.9
inches at Montgomery, Ala., 1.66 inches at Fort Wayne, Ind., 1.46
inches at Toledo, Ohio, 1.31 inches at Detroit and 1.25 inches at
Tallahassee, Fla.
   In the Priblof Islands of Alaska, winds were expected to drive
the wind chill factor down to 40 below zero overnight.
   The low temperature for the nation Thursday morning was 1 degree
above zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   High temperature records for the date were broken or tied in
Augusta, Ga., where it was 79, Boston (63), Concord, N.H. (57),
Portland, Maine (53) and Warmick, R.I. (61).

   Here are excerpts from former President Ronald
Reagan's testimony as a defense witness in the Iran-Contra trial of
his former national security adviser, John M. Poindexter:
   The testimony begins with direct examination by Poindexter's
lawyer, Richard W. Beckler.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. ... Well, I take it there came a time _ well, the first time,
on Nov. 13th (1986), you made an address to the nation. This is
about the Iranian missile project.
   A. Yes. To _ to explain that we were not doing business with
Khomeini. Quite the contrary. We were keeping it very secret from
him what we were doing.
   Q. Then you also about six days later, on November 19th ... you
again went before the American public and had a press conference on
that same subject, six days later?
   A. ... In my memory, there was a _ there was a second time, and
that was when the attorney general had located a paper which
revealed that there had been more money than the twelve million two
(hundred thousand dollars) that we had received, and that it had
been deposited in a Swiss bank account, and that that account had
been used in some way by people helping the Contras. ...
   Q. ... between the Nov. 13th and the Nov. 19th addresses that
you made to the nation, did you receive information from Admiral
Poindexter that enabled you to make those presentations to the
public?
   A. I don't recall.
   Q. ... The day before that, November 12th, you attended a
meeting with congressional leaders, and we understand that that was
first to tell Congress what was going on, so to speak, before you
went to the public on that situation.
   Do you have any recollection of that meeting with Congress?
   A. I know that someplace in there there were two meetings,
depending on the two various times, that we corrected the story,
that I did meet with the congressional leadership, members of both
parties.
   Q. Do you recall just _ I am not asking you to be at all
specific. But do you recall generally what was discussed with
Congress at that meeting on November 12th?
   A. Well, it was mainly my explaining to them what the situation
was and how it had come about. ...
   Q. Do you recall at that meeting whether or not you mentioned to
the congressional leaders anything about this Hawk missile shipment
that had taken place back in the previous November of 1985?
   A. No. I don't recall ever reporting that to anyone. ...
   Q. Mr. President, at some point, do you recall Admiral
Poindexter _ this is now in November of 1986. Do you remember
Admiral Poindexter telling you that people in the White House were
having trouble remembering _ or some of those events in 1985 on the
Hawk missile shipment, there were differing recollections of the
events?
   A. No. I don't recall hearing that.
   Q. Do you recall in 1986 meeting at all with (Attorney General
Edwin) Meese and asking him if he can lend a hand in straightening
out the recollections of various people?
   A. No. My memory of Mr. Meese's participation was when, after
all of that thing had broken, that he was the one who located a
piece of paper in some office that indicated that there was
additional money. And that was _ his participation was as attorney
general in case there was something untoward that was waiting there
to haunt us. And that was where I got the knowledge about the extra
money, and that is the only thing that I remember about from him.
   Q. ... Do you recall Secretary of State Shultz coming to you in
November of 1986 _ this is in that Nov. 19th-Nov. 20th time frame
of 1986 _ and telling you about a Hawk missile shipment that took
place back in December of _ excuse me _ November of 1985?
   A. I don't recall that.
   Q. Now, did there come a time, Mr. President, in 1984 _ early
1984 _ when it looked like funds that Congress had provided for
Contra support were running out? Do you recall that time frame?
   A. Yes.
   Q. Do you recall what your instructions were to your top people
at that time as to what ought to be done about this?
   A. Yes. My instructions were that whatever we did in trying to
maintain the existence of the Contras should be done within the
law. I emphasized that at every time.
   And I knew that there were groups of citizens who were on the
side of the Contras and who were soliciting funds to be of help to
the Contras. And I told them that maybe some of these citizens,
these people, wouldn't know who to contact or how to contact the
proper people to deliver the aid that they had raised for them. And
that I did not believe it was violating the law if our people who
knew, had the answer to those questions, would tell them, inform
them as to how they could make contact.
   But, again, I emphasized no solicitation. We were not going to
go out and try to solicit groups to do this. And I suggested at the
time that it wouldn't be against the law if we had an opportunity
to mention to some of our democratic allies that they should have
the same interest that we had with regard to the freedom fighters.
But, again, as I say, always emphasized within the law. ...
   But from the very beginning we all had to battle and fight to
get any funding from Congress for the Freedom Fighters, and finally
then they shut it off entirely.

   Officials in central France said Thursday bacteria
had been cleared from drinking drinking water, but authorities
elsewhere warned pregnant women of nitrate pollution.
   Health officials in the eastern city of Belfort told 20,000
residents to continue drinking bottled water or to add chlorine to
tap water.
   About 100,000 residents of the region were told on Wednesday not
to drink tap water because bacteria resulting from last week's
heavy rains and flooding clouded the water. Officials now say the
water should be safe to drink by Saturday.
   The problems have raised new worries about water pollution in
France and the national environment minister has criticized farmers
for their use of fertilizers.
   In central France, authorities at Chateauroux and Delos told
60,000 people a bacterial infestation had been cleared and lifted a
five-day ban on drinking tap water.
   Warnings were posted for pregnant women not to drink tap water
laced with dangerous levels of nitrates in 10 communities in the
western Maine-et-Loire region and 21 communities in the southern
Haute Garonne region.
   Regional authorities often warn ailing residents of the rural
areas of western France to avoid the water, which is polluted with
nitrates from fertilizers.
   The communities are suffering from the water contamination a
week after Source Perrier SA issued its worldwide recall of the
popular Perrier sparkling water. Traces of the cancer-causing
chemical benzene, which occur naturally in the underground spring,
were found in some bottles.
   On Wednesday, another mineral-water bottler, the Societe
Generale des Eaux Minerale de Vittel, announced it would withdraw 1
million to 2 million bottles of its domestically consumed Hepar
water from the shelves.
   Supplies of Hepar were contaminated Jan. 10-11 when water
sitting in an aboveground tank was contaminated by a filter clogged
with alkane, a hydrocarbon, Director Alain Dorfner said.
   On Thursday, the director of the Centres Leclerc supermarket
chain said he intends to drill for spring water in Brittany in
western France and offer it free to citizens. ``Everything is ready
for this,'' said Edouard Leclerc.
   The issue took on added urgency Tuesday when Environment
Minister Brice Lalonde declared that farming practices were ``a
black point'' on French efforts to keep water clean.
   Representatives of France's politically powerful farmers called
his statement a ``brutal'' attack, but said agricultural interests
were willing to work with the government to protect the quality of
water.

<HEAD>Top Winners at 32nd Grammys Survived Years of Struggle for
Attention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bonnie Raitt toiled at the blues for nearly
two decades before winning armfuls of Grammys, and ``Wind Beneath
My Wings'' lay around since 1982 before winning record and song of
the year for Bette Midler.
   Miss Raitt's triumph and the victory of Miss Midler's pop
version of an often-recorded country tune at the 32nd annual Grammy
Awards spotlighted the quirky nature of the rules and reflexes of
the Recording Academy.
   Now 40, Miss Raitt put out nine albums and was unsuccessfully
nominated for Grammys several times before she released ``Nick of
Time'' last year.
   And rather than a career peak, the LP was a comeback from a
mid-'80s plunge that included being dropped by her label, Warner
Bros., in 1983.
   Backstage at the Shrine Auditorium after collecting her fourth
Grammy Wednesday night, Miss Raitt was the victorious underdog.
   ``I feel like the guy that just beat Mike Tyson,'' she said.
``The critics and peers said finally she made a great record.''
   Her Grammys were for album of the year _ shared with producer
Don Was _ best female pop vocal for the LP's title track, best
female rock vocal for the album, and best traditional blues
recording for her collaboration with John Lee Hooker on the ``I'm
in the Mood'' track from his ``The Healer'' album.
   ``It means those of us that love R&amp;B are going to get a chance
again,'' Miss Raitt told fans in the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences.
   The road to acclaim for ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' recorded by
Miss Midler for the movie ``Beaches,'' was almost as long.
   Writers Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar penned the song in 1982 and
it was recorded first by singer Gary Morris.
   ``Well, I thought that's pretty obscure, maybe nobody bought
that record,'' Miss Midler said backstage. ``And then it turned out
after I recorded it that like a hundred people had recorded this
song and it had never crossed over.''
   Others who tried it before Miss Midler included Willie Nelson,
B.J. Thomas, Perry Como, Ray Price, Judy Collins and Sheena Easton.
   In ``Beaches'' the song underscored the theme of lifelong
friendship between two women, one of whom dies.
   ``It's the biggest record of my career,'' she said. ``I had a
platinum record (1 million units) on `The Rose' but this went
double platinum.''
   Though the song is old, the Academy's annual awards are for
actual recordings released in an eligibility period which this time
extended from Oct. 1, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989. Midler's version was
released Jan. 13, 1989.
   Song of the year Grammys went to writers Henley and Silbar. Miss
Midler and longtime producer Arif Mardin shared the record of the
year glory.
   ``I think one of the most rewarding things about the song is
that we got tremendous mail from people and there was a lot of
inspirational letters like `I was quarreling with my wife, I wanted
divorce, we make up after hearing this song,''' Mardin said.
   The 3{-hour show was viewed in 17.4 million households,
according to overnight Nielsen ratings. That was an increase of 3
million households over last year's show, which at 14.4 million
households had the lowest viewership since only 11.2 million
watched in 1975.
   However, the number of viewers set no records. Wednesday's show
had a Nielsen rating of 18.9 percent of the nation's 92.1 million
television homes. The 1984 show, when Michael Jackson's
``Thriller'' won album of the year, had a rating of 30.8 and was
viewed in 25.8 million households, Nielsen said.
   Other highlights of the Grammys included a best new artist honor
for Milli Vanilli.
   In the R&amp;B category Soul II Soul won group performance for the
``Back to Life'' single and best instrumental for ``African
Dance.'' Bobby Brown won male vocal for his ``Every Little Step''
single and Anita Baker won female vocal for the ``Giving You The
Best That I Got'' LP.
   Miles Davis received a lifetime achievement award and Grammys
for best jazz solo instrumental and big band jazz instrumental for
his ``Aura'' LP.
   Composer-arranger David Grusin also came out a big winner, with
three awards for his theatrical movie music.
   Michael Bolton's plaintive single ``How Am I Supposed To Live
Without You,'' won male pop vocal, and the tender love ballad
``Don't Know Much,'' by Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville, won duo
pop performance.
   Don Henley, who started the evening with four nominations, won
only the male rock vocal performance for his ``The End of the
Innocence'' album.
   ``Traveling Wilburys Volume One,'' the effort of the late Roy
Orbison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and George Harrison,
earned only the rock group vocal performance Grammy.
   Living Colour's single ``Cult of Personality'' won hard rock
performance and Metallica's single ``One'' earned best metal
performance. ``Bust A Move'' by Young M.C. was the best rap
performance.
   The country vocal collaboration Grammy went to Hank Williams Jr.
and his late father for the time-defying duet on ``There's A Tear
in My Beer,'' in which the younger Williams' voice was dubbed on an
old recording by his dad.
   Canadian country singer k.d. lang won best female vocal
performance in that category for her LP ``Absolute Torch and
Twang.''

<HEAD>Panel Approves Black Revolutionary Statue For Mall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foundation honoring Black History Month won
initial approval Thursday for the design of a memorial to black
Americans who participated in the American Revolution.
   The memorial, which would be the first on the Washington Mall
dedicated to blacks, honors some 5,000 soldiers and freedom-seekers
who have received relatively little recognition from historians.
   ``It was the beginning of the struggle for freedom in America,''
said Maurice Barboza, a Plainville, Conn., native and president of
The Patriots Foundation, the group promoting the memorial proposal.
``The Declaration of Independence galvanized the struggle for
freedom in America.''
   The National Capital Memorial Commission on Thursday unanimously
approved the design for the memorial, which is to be located on the
Mall near the reflecting pool, midway between the Lincoln Memorial
and the Washington Monument and not far from the Vietnam War
Memorial.
   Although the memorial will refer only to the Revolutionary War,
it will serve as a reminder, Barboza said, of the contribution
blacks made in the Civil War and the Vietnam War.
   Unveiled for the first time in model form Thursday, the memorial
consists of 13 figures _ one for each of the original colonies _ in
various roles black Americans played during the Revolution. The
figures would be made of bronze and placed on grnite pedestals.
   The figures would include soldiers and civilians, men, women and
children.
   Barboza said the foundation must raise $4 million and receive
approvals from two more federal boards _ the Fine Arts Commission
and the National Capital Planning Commission _ by October 1991 or
forfeit the land on the Mall.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III set
tough terms Thursday for normalizing U.S. relations with Nicaragua
if the Sandinista government wins Sunday's election and reserved
the right to determine if the contest is fair.
   Baker's testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee means
U.S. hostility toward the Nicaraguan government would not
automatically end if the Sandinistas triumph at the polls.
   He said the United States would insist on ``a substantial period
of good behavior,''including an end to support for leftist
insurgents in neighboring El Salvador and reconciliation with
domestic political opponents _ before ending economic sanctions and
restoring full diplomatic relations.
   The secretary accused the government of President Daniel Ortega
of intimidating opponents and poll watchers besides denying visas
to congressional observers.
   The leading opposition group _ the United National Opposition,
headed by Violeta Chamorro _ has received U.S. aid in its bid to
govern the country.
   Baker said that the Unites States is ``prepared to recognize a
government that wins a free election.'' But he then set conditions
that must be met for the restoration of normal relations and
asserted U.S. authority to judge the elections.
   ``Before we talk about normalizing relations (if Ortega is
re-elected), ... we must see a sustained period of good behavior.
   ``The government of the United States must be satisfied that
there will continue to be open political space in Nicaragua. Then
we can consider beginning to look at how we might normalize''
relations, including lifting the trade sanctions.
   Answering a question from Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., Baker
said, ``It seems to me that if you believe in democracy you believe
in respecting the results of a free and fair election.''
   But he added, ``The United States must reserve the right to make
the judgment (as to) whether the election is free and fair.''
   Observer groups, including one led by former President Carter
and another sponsored by the United Nations, will assess the
election and ``arrive at reasoned judgments'' about its fairness,
the secretary said. ``But, in light of experience, the United
States needs to make its own judgment.''
   The Nicaraguan government, in denying visas to congressional
observers appointed by President Bush, argued that the observers
could not be objective because the United States is providing money
to the Chamorro campaign.
   While the United States has never broken relations and maintains
an embassy in Managua, it is staffed by only a handful of American
diplomats. The last U.S. ambassador was expelled in July 1988.
   The Reagan administration provided military aid to the Contra
rebels until Congress suspended it in February 1988. The Bush
administration is using economic and diplomatic pressures against
the Sandinistas, while holding to a trade embargo imposed in 1985.
   In an hour of testimony before the House committee, Baker also:
   _Credited the Chinese government with freeing some political
prisoners, toning down its anti-U.S. rhetoric and showing interest
in receiving Peace Corps volunteers.
   _Said the administration would consider holding negotiations to
withdraw short-range nuclear weapons from Western Europe if NATO
and the Warsaw Pact conclude a treaty to reduce troops and
conventional arms.
   The treaty, now in negotiations in Vienna, would leave up to
225,000 American soldiers in Western Europe and 195,000 Soviet
troops on foreign soil.
   _Showed impatience with a lack of progress in starting
negotiations between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   Baker, who meets on Friday at the State Department with Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, said:
   ``We need action. We have done a lot of talking; the time for
action is coming very close.''

<HEAD>Ethnic Albanians Strike, Boycott Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police, soldiers and tanks patrolled
Kosovo on Thursday, a day of strikes and school boycotts by ethnic
Albanians to protest alleged human rights violations in the poor
southern province.
   Passive resistance continued despite harsh measures by federal
authorities, who imposed a nighttime curfew Wednesday and deployed
army units in an effort to quell unrest.
   At least 28 ethnic Albanians have been killed in outbursts of
violence over the past month between police and residents demanding
more autonomy for the province, which adjoins Albania and is
Yugoslavia's poorest region.
   The same number were reported killed a year ago when Serbia made
constitutional changes giving it nearly complete control over
Kosovo, which had been an autonomous province within the Serbian
republic.
   Ethnic Albanians, most of whom are Moslems, make up 90 percent
of Kosovo's 1.9 million people. Outnumbered Slavs, predominantly
Christian, claim they are harassed by the majority.
   No large protests were reported Thursday, but thousands of
ethnic Albanians continued strikes and school boycotts to protest
the state of virtual martial law.
   A joint statement by the seven unofficial organizations of
ethnic Albanians issued in Pristina, the provincial capital,
denounced alleged ``police brutality.''
   ``Police are storming schools, hospitals, houses, churches and
mosques where they intimidate, loot and beat up people,'' it said.
The charges could not be confirmed.
   The statement asked ethnic Albanians to stop street protests
```because it would lead to more repression'' by the authorities,
and appealed for a discussion of solutions by ``all democratic
forces in Serbia.''
   Serbian authorities and the Serbs in Kosovo have rejected
dialogue with ethnic Albanian groups, describing their leaders as
``hostile elements'' who should be jailed.
   Serbia says it needs control of the province to prevent
persecution of the Slavic minority. They say Albanian ``terrorists
and separatists'' want to secede from Yugoslavia and make Kosovo
part of Albania.
   Police in bulletproof vests patrolled towns in the province
Thursday, aided by army tanks and armored vihicles.
   In Belgrade, the federal government said the measures taken in
the province ``have as their purpose the creation of the necessary
preconditions to enable'' talks to begin on ``a political solution
of the problems in Kosovo,'' the official news agency Tanjug
reported.
   ``Such a dialogue is indispensable in order to thwart efforts of
separatist forces'' a government statement said.

<HEAD>Dozens Hurt as Tornadoes, High Winds Rage Across South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful storm rose out of the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and
surged through the South, spinning off tornadoes that ripped apart
homes, toppled trees and injured dozens of people.
   The tornadoes touched down along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi
and in several places in rural Alabama. A powerful blast of wind
also swept through Columbus, Ga., but weather officials were
uncertain whether it was a tornado.
   Heavy thunderstorms or rainshowers also were reported from
Florida to Michigan, posing a threat of floods in some places. The
wet weather was the result of low pressure that was pulling
moisture northward out of the Gulf.
   The first two tornadoes were reported shortly after midnight in
the Gulf Coast town of Pass Christian, Miss., where at least 30
homes were damaged, the National Weather Service said.
   The storm drove northeastward during the night and a tornado
touched down just before dawn in Opp, Ala., damaging more than 40
homes and two businesses, and destroying two mobile homes.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a reporter with radio
station WOPP.
   The twister knocked out power, covered streets with the mangled
remains of trees and blew out windows. Ten people were injured, one
seriously enough to be hospitalized.
   Later tornadoes were reported in Pike and Barbour counties, to
the northwest of Opp.
   Three people were critically injured in Pike County, where the
twister hit about 10 miles south of the town of Troy. It ripped
apart three mobile homes and deposited a pickup truck in a tree.
   A spokeswoman at Edge Regional Medical Center in Troy said two
women, ages 86 and 44, and a 67-year-old man were listed in
critical condition.
   At South Macon High School in Alabama's Macon County, secretary
Portia Johnson said 11 girls suffered cuts and scrapes when the
ceiling collapsed in a girl's restroom about 7:30 a.m.
   In Auburn, an elementary school was closed after two trees
crashed into the building. The high winds also leveled a U.S.
Department of Agriculture barn and tore part of the roof off the
campus police station at Auburn University.
   In Columbus, Ga., which is just across the border from Alabama,
the storm struck with tornado-like winds shortly after 9 a.m.
   The storm ripped the roof off a service station, knocked out
power and phone service in parts of the downtown area and injured
two people, who were treated for lacerations and released from the
Medical Center, officials said.
   Wind damage also was reported in LaGrange, Ga., where two mobile
homes were destroyed and about eight other homes were damaged.
Trees also were uprooted, but no injuries were reported.

   Soldiers used tear gas and clubs to
disperse hundreds of student deomonstrators Thursday in what has
become the largest outbreak of anti-government protest in years.
   The government and the state-run news media have been silent
about the protests, which began Monday when students angered by
cuts in water and power service demanded democracy and the
resignation of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   At one point, Thursday's protesters assembled outside the state
television offices in suburban Cocody, shouting: ``Tell the truth!
Tell the truth!'' They fled when soldiers and police attacked them
with truncheons.
   Students said they tried to march on the presidential offices,
but police and soldiers blocked them less than a mile from the
university.
   Earlier in the day, police attacked more than 300 students as
they protested peacefully at the state university campus in Cocody,
singing ``Greetings, Land of Hope,'' the national anthem.
   A local resident said police and soldiers also fired tear gas at
students who fled and tried to continue the demonstration.
   Armed police in riot helmets sealed off the campus, but lifted
the blockade later the campus appeared calm.
   Students said many had been injured since Monday. Police beat
students who set two cars ablaze Monday night, and on Tuesday
officers charged students who smashed the windows of two buses.
   This pro-Western nation in West Africa, one of the continent's
richest, is struggling with a recession that has brought
unemployment, salary cuts and declining living standards.
   Houphouet-Boigny, officially 84 years old but believed to be in
his 90s, has ruled Ivory Coast as a one-party state since
independence from France in 1960.

<HEAD>Business, Administration Support National Product Liability Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business executives and a Bush administration
official said Thursday that a national product liability law is
essential to U.S. competitiveness in the world market.
   ``If we are serious about addressing our nation's
competitiveness, we must address the excessive burdens placed on
American business by our current liability system,'' said Wendell
Wilkie II, general counsel for the Commerce Department.
   A federal product liability law would make the rules for doing
business ``clear, consistent, uniform and predictable,'' Wilkie
said in testimony before the Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee.
   State laws ``are more burdensome and unpredictable than those in
any of our other trading partners,'' he added.
   Senator Robert Kasten, R-Wis., author of a bill to establish a
national law, said member nations of the European Economic
Community already had adopted uniform product liability guidelines
which would increase their advantage in global markets.
   ``We're going to be in a position very quickly in which Germany,
France and England are going to have uniform laws while Wisconsin,
Minnesota and Illinois are going to be further apart,'' Kasten said.
   Kasten's bill would create a uniform standard for imposing
punitive damages in product liability lawsuits and estblish a
two-year statute of limitations for most product liability claims.
Claims by workers injured by durable goods such as factory
machinery would have a 25-year statute of limitations.
   The measure would allow separate trials or settlements of
punitive damages and compensatory damages and allow companies to
pay damages in proportion to their responsibility for harm.
   Businessmen Howard Fark and Robert C. Holland said change was
needed in the current system to stop the rapid rise in business
insurance costs.
   Wilkie said a uniform law also would reduce ``transaction
costs'' _ attorneys' fees, damage awards and other court costs _
associated with lawsuits involving potentially dangerous products.
   But Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., blamed
businesses for the rise in insurance and legal costs and challenged
the need for federal intervention in product liability.
   Others, including Vincent L. McKusick, chief judge of the Maine
Supreme Court, and Michael Box, an Alabama state representative,
argued that the federal government should aid state enforcement
instead of ``tinkering'' unnecessarily with state law.
   Hollings cited a 1989 congressional study that showed ``About
half the plaintiffs' attorneys received no fee.''
   The study by the General Accounting Office also found that most
punitive damages are overturned on appeal, said Hollings, adding,
``this goes to the heart of transaction costs.''
   The GAO reviewed court records of 305 product liability cases
resolved in trials from 1983-85 in Arizona, Massachusetts,
Missouri, North Dakota and South Carolina.
   Proponents acknowledge the Kasten bill might not directly reduce
transaction costs but said the bill would encourage faster
resolution of disputes because it requires that lawyers who refuse
reasonable out-of court settlements must pay all attorneys' fees.
   Congress has attempted to develop a federal product liability
law since the 1970s, and President Bush made it an administration
legislative priority in his State of the Union address last month.

<HEAD>State Trooper Says He was Told Tanker Captain was Drunk</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state trooper who was summoned to the
grounded Exxon Valdez to deal with an allegedly drunken skipper
testified Thursday that when he arrived, Capt. Joseph Hazelwood
didn't seem impaired.
   The trooper, Michael J. Fox, said at Hazelwood's criminal trial
that Coast Guard officials told him ``the captain was drunk and
they wanted me to take care of it.'' He assumed ``they needed help
wrestling this drunk off the tanker.''
   But when he arrived aboard a Coast Guard boat at the scene of
the nation's worst oil spill, Fox said, the situation wasn't as he
expected.
   ``When I got there I was expecting a brawl,'' Fox testified.
``But it was kind of quiet and dark and everyone was gazing out the
windows.''
   He said he asked Hazelwood what was the problem. It was then, he
said, that Hazelwood referred to himself in the much-quoted
comment, ``You're looking at it.''
   The skipper didn't seem drunk or impaired in any way, the
trooper testified.
   ``He had bloodshot eyes and was smoking cigarettes,'' Fox
recalled. ``I didn't notice any alcohol. He had morning breath, bad
breath. ... He seemed unimpaired.''
   The 43-year-old Hazelwood of Huntington, N.Y., is charged in
state court with second-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and
three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   The Exxon Valdez leaked nearly 11 million gallons of Alaskan
crude oil, which blackened hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and
killed countless birds, fish and wildlife. Exxon has spent some $2
billion trying to clean up the mess.
   Also Thursday, a Coast Guard officer's testimony that he smelled
alcohol on Hazelwood's breath was challenged on the basis of
remarks the witness made earlier in a television interview.
   Jurors were shown a tape of a CBS interview by Connie Chung, who
asked Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Falkenstein if he smelled alcohol on
Hazelwood's breath shortly after the tanker grounded.
   ``I never talked to him face-to-face like we're talking. It was
side-by-side and staring out at the pilot house across the deck. We
were close, 2{ feet, and I smelled alcohol in and around the
area,'' Falkenstein said on the television broadcast.
   Falkenstein testified in the trial that he detected alcohol on
the skipper's breath.
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Brent Cole, who has
been trying to prove Hazelwood had been drinking, asked if there
was anyone else present in the area when Falkenstein smelled
liquor. He said there wasn't.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, asked if the captain
appeared impaired or intoxicated.
   ``That was the first time I had met Captain Hazelwood,'' said
the witness. ``I saw no signs of impairment.''
   Falkenstein, who is executive officer of the Coast Guard's
marine safety office in Valdez, was questioned at length about a
key issue _ whether the Exxon Valdez was required to have an
officer on the bridge with a pilot's license for Prince William
Sound.
   He said federal regulations required that a certified officer
directly control the ship, but the regulations were eased twice
after the opening of the Alaska pipeline in the late 1970s.
   Ultimately, they permitted a ship to cross the area without a
licensed pilot if visibility was two miles or more, Falkenstein
said.
   Hazelwood was the only officer on board with such a license when
the accident occurred, and he wasn't on the bridge.

<TEXT>
   Sudanese guerrillas have released two European
doctors who were kidnapped earlier this month and forced to treat
rebels, a French relief agency said Thursday.
   After the freed doctors arrived Thursday at the airport in
Nairobi, Kenya, the international group Doctors Without Borders
suspended its aid programs in Sudan.
   ``Aid activities are becoming impossible and put the lives of
our teams in danger,'' a statement released by the agency's Paris
headquarters said. ``We have become targets.''
   Talks had been under way for weeks between the rebels and the
agency to win freedom for 28-year-old Martin Ruppert of the
Netherlands and Christine van Haegenoth, 26, of Belgium.
   They were kidnapped Feb. 3 from their home in Malakal, a
garrison city on the Nile about 370 miles south of Khartoum. They
had been working on a long-term nutritional project.
   The agency statement did not say when or where they were
released and did not mention their physical condition, but previous
statements have said they were in good health.
   The statement said the agency's French and Belgian sections had
withdrawn all their personnel, about 70 workers, from the African
country, where southern rebels are fighting civil war against the
government in Khartoum.
   Most personnel of the French section were withdrawn after
unidentified attackers shot down a plane in December carrying two
of its doctors, a French pilot and a Sudanese working for the
United Nations. All aboard were killed.
   Workers in the Belgian section began leaving after the
kidnapping.

<TEXT>
   The government repeated its pledge
Thursday not to make nuclear weapons and told the United States it
should not worry about France's agreement to sell a nuclear power
plant to Pakistan.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France announced Wednesday he
was lifting a 14-year-old ban on the sale of nuclear energy to
Pakistan to allow the sale.
   The State Department criticized the decision to make the sale
without requiring Pakistan to comply with international safeguards
on its nuclear programs.
   A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman repeated the government's
oft-stated promise not to produce a nuclear weapon and told a news
conference: ``The United States reaction to the French decision to
sell Pakistan a nuclear power plant is not well-founded.''
   Pakistan has not signed the International Non-Proliferation
Treaty and says it will not do so without India, which also refuses
to sign.
   The United States and several other nations have repeatedly
expressed concern that Pakistan is close to making a nuclear
weapon. Islamabad denies it.
   ``Pakistan is fully aware of the United States concerns about
nuclear proliferation and it has reassured the world, time and
again, that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful,'' said the
Foreign Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``France is a sovereign state,'' he said in reply to a question
of whether the United States or any other country could pressure
Paris to renege on the deal. ``France will stand by the deal.''
   In 1976, France reneged on a deal to sell Pakistan a nuclear
reprocessing plant. Pakistani officials said Paris canceled that
sale because of U.S. pressure.
   The new plant will be installed at Chashma, 120 miles southwest
of Islamabad. No official cost was given, but it was believed to be
about $1.5 billion.

<HEAD>California School Says It Gets Letter From Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WALNUT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Antonio Noriega, writing to
teen-age students from a Florida jail cell, claimed that thousands
of innocent Panamanians were killed by the U.S. invaders of his
country last December, school officials said.
   ``That was the Christian Christmas that the troops and
government of your country gave to a small country of 2 million
people,'' says a letter apparently signed by the deposed Panamanian
leader.
   Written in Spanish on a single sheet of yellow legal paper,
dated Dec. 31 and postmarked Miami, the letter condemns the United
States ``for killing thousands of children, men, women, old people
and people from the Army, innocents, in my country on Dec. 20.''
   U.S. officials put casualties at 500.
   The letter was a response to a request from eighth-grade
students at Suzanne Middle School in Walnut, 25 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles.
   ``It's really wild for the kids. For the first time in their
lives, they're in contact with someone in the news, so they're in
shock, but they're starting to feel good about it,'' teacher Alan
Haskvitz said Thursday.
   Haskvitz said he didn't attempt to authenticate the letter that
arrived Tuesday, but he believes it is genuine because ``the tone
of the letter ... sounds like him.''
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. forces Jan. 3, is held at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center In Dade County, Fla. His March 5
trial date on drug conspiracy charges has been delayed indefinitely.
   Calls to the jail and Noriega's attorneys to confirm he sent the
letter weren't immediately returned Thursday. Defense attorneys
were in Geneva conferring with the International Red Cross on
Noriega's prisoner-of-war status.
   ``We are interested in getting your side of the story on the
Panama invasion,'' the social studies class wrote. ``Would you
please tell us what happened, how you plan to escape jail
(sentence), how is the food and your family?''
   The response was translated into English by student Patricia
Garcia, 14, who also rendered the students' letter in Spanish,
Haskvitz said.
   The letter thanked the students for their interest, defended
Noriega's actions and complained about negative publicity he's
received.
   ``The press of your country ... has misinformed and distorted
the image of a nationalistic and patriotic leader who struggled,
struggles and will struggle for the sovereignty of his country,
Panama,'' the letter said.
   The letter said there are 1,000 prisoners of war, including
civilians, under U.S. control.
   U.S. authorities said anyone detained by U.S. troops were either
released or turned over to Panamanian authorities.
   Student Lisa Isomura, 14, said the correspondence was a valuable
lesson.
   ``Mr. Haskvitz told us there are two sides to everything, but
most of us didn't really know what was going on until we got the
letter,'' she said. ``Now, we know Mr. Noriega's side as well.''
   The letter will be published in an upcoming issue of the school
newspaper Challenger, Haskvitz said, conceding he was surprised the
students were able to locate Noriega.
   ``They tracked him down using plain old-fashioned detective
skills,'' said the teacher. He added that the class has a new,
follow-up assignment: to ask President Bush to respond to Noriega's
allegations.

<TEXT>
   An army officer told a military court Thursday
that soldiers often beat Palestinian detainees in violation of
orders, Israel radio said.
   The testimony by Lt. Col. Ephraim Fein came a day after the U.S.
State Department released a report saying Israeli soldiers often
ignored regulations and many unauthorized killings by soldiers went
unpunished.
   Fein, former commander of the elite Givati Brigade, testified in
the trial of four Givati reserve soldiers accused of beating two
Palestinian detainees in the occupied Gaza Strip in February 1988.
One detainee later died.
   A defense attorney also cited previous testimony as saying that
Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, at that time the army chief in the Gaza
Strip, beat a Palestinian who refused orders to clear a stone
roadblock. Mordechai is now chief of the army's Central Command,
which includes the occupied West Bank.
   At least 13 Palestinian teen-agers were wounded by army gunfire
Thursday in scattered clashes in the occupied lands, hospital
officials said. They said a 15-year-old girl was shot in the leg
while trying to stop soldiers from beating her brother during an
army raid in Qalqilya.
   The army confirmed that six Arabs were wounded in the Gaza Strip
and said it was checking the other reports.
   At least 658 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the revolt, now in its 27th month. Forty-three
Israelis have died, and more than 180 Palestinians have been slain
by their fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators.
   The Givati trial revived debate in Israel over army policy of
beating Palestinian suspects in the occupied lands. Beatings became
widespread after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in January 1988
authorized soldiers to beat Palestinians during violent
demonstrations.
   Fein, who testified for the prosecution, told the court that at
the time of the beatings at the center of the case, his soldiers
were ``in a situation close to war.''
   ``The orders were changed and eroded to keep up with the fast
pace of events,'' he said.
   Fein also recalled an incident in which he himself violated
orders on beatings.
   ``When they (soldiers) arrested an Arab, they bound his hands
and feet and blindfolded him. One soldier helped him get down from
the jeep, and he spit at the soldier. I slapped the Arab in an
instinctive reaction,'' the radio quoted Fein as saying.
   The army said Thursday it had captured three Palestinian
fugitives in the West Bank wanted for attacks on Israeli targets.
They also allegedly killed two Arabs suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   A military commander interviewed on Israel TV said the three
were involved in the public execution Feb. 16 of an alleged
informer who was hacked to death while hundreds watched.

   The former president of Wedtech Corp., whose
testimony helped convict a congressman and a friend of ex-U.S.
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was sentenced Thursday to five
months in prison for his role in the corruption scandal.
   Anthony Guariglia was one of four officials of the New York-area
military contractor who pleaded guilty in 1987 to federal charge of
conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.
   Guariglia testified at the racketeering trials of former U.S.
Rep. Mario Biaggi and E. Robert Wallach, the San Francisco attorney
who is a close associate of Meese. Both were convicted of receiving
illegal payments from Wedtech officials
   ``This Wedtech scandal has certainly been a disgrace to this
great country,'' Guariglia said to U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Stewart. He said he was remorseful and ashamed of his actions.
   Stewart sentenced Guariglia to five months in prison and three
years' probation. He also ordered the defendant to get counseling
for a gambling addiction.
   The judge said Guariglia could subtract from the prison sentence
the time he served since last month, when prosecutors revealed that
he had violated his cooperation agreement by lying on the witness
stand at Wallach's trial.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss said Guariglia admitted he
lied when he testified he hadn't gambled, which would have violated
a court order. Guariglia had actually incurred a $17,000 gambling
debt at a Puerto Rican casino in late 1988, Weiss said.
   The perjury issue has prompted a request by Wallach's attorneys
for a new trial.
   Gary Naftalis, a Wallach attorney, said a motion was filed
earlier this month with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
asking that the case be returned to the trial judge so he can
consider granting a new trial. Wallach's attorneys are seeking a
hearing on the scope of Guariglia's perjury.
   ``Obviously it seems plain to us that Wallach should not be
convicted based on testimony of an admitted perjurer,'' Naftalis
said in a telephone interview. ``It undermines the integrity of the
entire prosecution.''
   Wallach was convicted in August after a four-month trial of
illegally receiving $425,000 from Wedtech to influence Meese and
other government officials as part of Wedtech's efforts to gain
government business. The company went bankrupt in 1986 after
allegations of corruption were made public.
   Wallach was sentenced to six years in prison for his
racketeering conviction but is free pending appeal, which is being
handled by a group of attorneys that includes Robert Bork, the
former U.S. Supreme Court nominee.
   Guariglia was the last of the four Wedtech officials who
cooperated to be sentenced. The others are former Wedtech vice
chairman Mario Moreno, sentenced to 18 months in prison; Wedtech
co-founder Fred Neuberger, sentenced to two years and three months
in prison; and Larry Shorten, a Wedtech financial official, who
received probation.

   Efforts to block confirmation of conservative
civil rights official Clarence Thomas as an appeals judge largely
dried up Thursday as a Senate panel voted to send his nomination to
the floor for final action.
   ``His capacity and competence I think are beyond attack,''
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said as the Senate Judiciary
Committee voted 12-1 in favor of the nomination.
   Critics conceded afterward that the full Senate was all but
guaranteed to confirm Thomas, who as chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission over the last eight years was one
of the most visible blacks in the Reagan administration.
   Only Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, among committee members,
voted against sending the nomination to the floor.
   Just weeks ago, conservative supporters of Thomas and civil
rights forces were digging in for a fight, with senior citizens
groups complaining that the commission has allowed thousands of
age-bias cases to expire without action.
   Thomas said that state fair-employment commissions were to blame.
   But Thomas came in for renewed criticism late Thursday as Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., inserted a statement in the Congressional
Record, complaining that several thousand age-discrimination
claimants ``during Chairman Thomas' watch lost their rights largely
due to EEOC neglect and mismanagement.''
   Pryor, chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, said many answers
that Thomas gave senators who asked about the problem at his
confirmation hearing ``appeared to be shaky attempts at revisionist
history.'' Pryor said he had not yet decided how to vote on
confirmation.
   An underlying concern among congressional liberals clearly was
speculation that within a few years Thomas could be ripe for
advancement to the Supreme Court. ``I have some concerns about this
man in terms of whether I could support him for the Supreme
Court,'' Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., declared.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., also said he might view a Thomas
nomination for the Supreme Court in a different light. Biden said
that standards for a Supreme Court justice are higher than those
for the appeals bench.
   Thomas is under consideration for the vacancy left by the
resignation of Robert Bork from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. Bork resigned after the Senate rejected him
for the Supreme Court at the close of the most embittered
confirmation fight in decades.
   Thomas, who climbed from an impoverished childhood in rural
Georgia to graduation from Yale law school, is an outspoken critic
of racial hiring quotas and affirmative action programs. Civil
rights forces have long been cool to him because of these views.
   Steam drained out of efforts to block his confirmation, however,
when Benjamin Hooks, head of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said two weeks ago that he would not
take part in the effort.
   The Alliance for Justice, a liberal court-watcher group that was
among the severest critics of the nomination, issued a statement
after committee action, saying it was ``clear that senators hold
grave doubts about the nominee's qualifications.'' It said his
performance on the bench ``will be watched carefully to determine
whether he is truly committed to the rule of law.''
   Metzenbaum, a leading congressional liberal, told the committee
he had initially expected to vote to confirm Thomas but changed his
mind at the confirmation hearing when Thomas blamed state fair
employment agencies for problems involving numerous
age-discrimination cases. In these cases, the statute of
limitations for action expired before the complaints were processed.
   ``I was flabbergasted that he did not know that the state
agencies are under contract to process state age-discrimination
claims,'' Metzenbaum said. He said the federal commission is
responsible for enforcing the contract and regulating the actions
of the state agencies.

   Maoist guerrillas killed six people in a
series of attacks, including a village mayor and councilman, but
police tracked down and killed three of the rebels, authorities
said Thursday.
   At least 60 mayors now have been killed by the Shining Path
insurgency in the last 14 months.
   Police in Ayacucho said the rebels shot Mayor Raul Palomino and
Councilman Juan Escalante, both from Anco, 205 miles southeast of
Lima.
   Police said the two were killed Monday in an attack on the
Ayacucho home where they were staying, but were not immediately
identified.
   An Interior Department statement said guerrillas also killed a
police sergeant Thursday in Atalaya, a jungle town 235 miles
southeast of Lima.
   Three of the rebels later were killed by a police patrol sent to
pursue them. Another rebel was injured but escaped, according to
the report.
   Police in Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima, said Shining Path
guerrillas simultaneously broke into three homes there Wednesday
and stabbed and shot to death two students and a peasant, then left
notes accusing each victim of theft.
   The Shining Path has been trying topple to Peru's elected
government since 1980. The government says more than 17,500 people
have died in the violence.

   Ronald Reagan's videotaped deposition gave
Iran-Contra prosecutors new ammunition for the trial of John M.
Poindexter even though the former president tried hard to help his
former national security adviser.
   Reagan endorsed the truthfulness of a letter Poindexter wrote to
Congress assuring lawmakers that White House aides were not helping
the Nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional ban.
   The former president, who winked and nodded at Poindexter when
he took the witness stand, said he was ``in total agreement'' with
the letter and hadn't authorized anything but the truth.
   But Iran-Contra prosecutors charge the letter was a false
statement to Congress. And if they can convince Poindexter's jury
of that, Reagan's statements about what he did or didn't authorize
could be a problem for his former aide.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb said to Reagan concerning the truthfulness
of the letter, ``You do understand that is a matter that ultimately
the jury will have an opportunity to determine in this case, don't
you?''
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene ordered that remark stricken
from the record, but the jury in Poindexter's case will in all
likelihood face that question.
   Part of Poindexter's defense, as outlined in court papers, is
that he had no reason to lie to Congress because his activities
were authorized by the president.
   But Reagan, during cross-examination by Webb, said he never
authorized Poindexter to lie to Congress about the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``At any time did you ever approve or give authority to John
Poindexter to make any false or misleading statements to any
congressional committee regarding events related to the Iran-Contra
controversy?'' Webb asked.
   ``No, and I don't think any false statements were made,'' Reagan
said, again trying to defend Poindexter.
   During the videotaped deposition, taken last week in Los Angeles
and shown Thursday in Washington, Reagan testified that members of
the National Security Council staff were in contact with the
Nicaraguan Contras during the congressional ban on direct U.S.
military aid.
   But during cross-examination, Reagan said he never ``had any
inkling'' that Poindexter's aide Oliver North was helping devise
military strategy for the Contras.
   The former president contended that there was no diversion of
U.S.-Iran arms sale proceeds to the rebels until Webb confronted
him with details of such a diversion in the report of the
commission Reagan appointed to investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``To the extent that there was in fact a diversion of proceeds,
did you in any way approve or authorize that while you were
president of the United States?''
   ``For heaven's sake, no,'' Reagan replied.
   Michael Bromwich, who was on the Iran-Contra prosecution team in
North's trial, said that Reagan's lack of knowledge about North and
Poindexter's activities could be damaging for the defense.
   ``Reagan seems to have very little idea of what was going on so
he certainly didn't authorize or approve of what North or
Poindexter was doing doing based on full knowledge of the facts,''
said Bromwich, now a Washington lawyer.
   Reagan's statements could help prosecutors contend that the
former president was deceived by the man he entrusted to advise him
on the most sensitive matters of government.
   At one point, Reagan said he couldn't recall which government
official told him that a C-123 transport plane shot down over
Nicaragua was not connected with the U.S. government.
   But Webb showed Reagan the written answers he gave to the
Iran-Contra grand jury, in which the former president stated that
Poindexter had told him that the crash's sole survivor, Eugene
Hasenfus was not part of the covert resupply operation run by North.
   Hasenfus' involvement in the secret resupply efforts is well
documented and the prosecutors could argue to jurors that
Poindexter lied about this to Reagan.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was a recipient of one of
Poindexter's letters when he chaired the House Intelligence
Committee, said Reagan's testimony ``takes away one of the defenses
that Admiral Poindexter was asserting.''
   ``That defense was that he was specifically authorized to do
what he did,'' Hamilton said.
   Hamilton said he expects the defense will rely more on the
notion ``that the president created a certain environment or
climate in the White House that gave the signal or the impression
to Admiral Poindexter that he could do what he did.''

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
told Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Thursday his
newly democractic nation intends to be more active in the United
Nations.
   At the end of his first official visit to the United States, he
told reporters Czechoslovakia does not seek a role in negotiations
on German reunification, but understands Poland's desire to
participate in talks that could affect its borders.
   One-third of what is now Poland was in Germany before World War
II and the Poles are worried about possible territorial claims by a
united Germany.
   Havel, a dissident playwright who often was jailed by the
Communist regime that collapesd last year, evaded a question about
his talks with President Bush and whether the administration
rebuffed his government's request for reduced levels of U.S. and
NATO troops in Europe.
   ``This question has been raised in my conversation with Mr. Bush
and it came out that we understand each other better than before,''
he said.
   Czechoslovakia also is negotiating with the Soviet Union for
withdrawal of the 75,000 Red Army soldiers stationed in
Czechoslovakia.
   Later, Prime Minister Marian Calfa told the news conference:
``We do regard the presence of U.S. troops in Europe as a
stabilizing factor.
   ``We believe European stability should not depend so much on
military forces and we should seek a security system that could
replace the current forms ... a new system (so that) the presence
of any foreign troops on the territory of any country would be
unnecessary.''
   Calfa said the United Nations can play a major role in
international relations, but emphasized, ``It is much more
important that we play a more substantial role in the U.N. than we
have played until now.''
   Havel spoke in the same vein earlier to Perez de Cuellar and
said Czechoslovakia was eager to pursue a more active and
independent course in the world.
   He and Havel spoke in Czech and their comments were translated
by an interpreter.

<TEXT>
   A top election observer said Thursday
that a fair vote is possible this weekend despite charges of
planned fraud or violence by both the ruling Sandinistas and their
opponents.
   ``I ask that all Nicaraguans be allowed to exercise their right
to vote peacefully'' on Sunday, Joao Baena Soares,
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, said at a
news conference.
   He specifically asked ``those involved in military activities''
_ both the Sandinista army and the U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas _
not to interfere.
   The campaigning has halted for a three-day cooling-off period.
   President Daniel Ortega told a news conference that the huge
crowd that greeted his closing speech Wednesday night was a sure
sign of victory.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Ortega's major rival, countered
that Ortega made a ``desperate speech, without foundations, full of
tired rhetoric.''
   She told a lunch in her honor that the Sandinistas had tried to
split her United National Opposition, but the 14-party coalition's
``maturity'' prevailed.
   Mrs. Chamorro and her running mate, Virgilio Godoy, said they
expected to win Sunday's election despite the turnout Wednesday of
300,000 supporters for Ortega, a huge showing in a country with
1.75 million registered voters.
   She noted that the Sandinistas had brought in supporters from
towns and cities for miles around and said that many were too young
to vote, although that was not apparent to other observers.
   Ortega appeared determined to strike a statesmanlike note at his
news conference, especially regarding the United States. More than
400 journalists were in attendance.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee Thursday that even if the Sandinistas win a fair
vote, relations would not be normalized ``until we see a
substantial period of good behavior,'' including a halt to support
for leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Asked if he thought Baker was setting new conditions, Ortega
said he expected to be able to negotiate security and other issues
with the United States after the election.
   Ortega was asked five times if Nicaragua would promise to halt
aid to El Salvador's guerrillas, but he said only that a regional
agreement exists calling for suspension of aid. He said the United
States should stop helping the Contras before pointing a finger at
someone else.
   Asked if the Sandinistas would give up power if they lost
Sunday's vote, Ortega said his party would ``respect the will of
the people'' but that a political defeat does not ``transfer total
power to the victors.''
   The issue has become a point of contention because senior
Sandinista officials have said they would not yield control of the
army and police if they lose.
   Ortega said the question was ``conceptual'' in any case.
   ``Hypothetically, there is no chance of an electoral victory for
any other party in Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Ortega hopes to force the United States to help disband the
Contras and normalize relations with a victory certified by
international observers, but Baker said the United States would not
necessarily accept the observers' word.
   Baena Soares became indignant when asked if the OAS was favoring
the Sandinistas.
   He said nobody had made that accusation and that the observers
would ``maintain our integrity, our impartiality and above all our
independence.''
   ``The conditions exist for a fair election,'' said Soares, who
heads a contingent of more than 400 observers.
   One of them, former U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson,
toured provincial election centers in northern Nicaragua.
   Cardinal Manuel Obando y Bravo told reporters the Sandinistas
``have changed during the electoral campaign. I would like to
interpret that as a permanent change.'' The Roman Catholic prelate
often has leaned toward the government.
   Obando said he would vote Sunday for the first time in his life
because, after years of civil war, ``We must make an effort to
resolve our problems through civilized methods.''
   He refused to reveal his choice, but added, ``If Nicaragua does
not put an end to violence, violence will put an end to Nicaragua.''

<TEXT>
   At least 2.3 million Americans will suffer from
severe, debilitating dementia such as Alzheimer's disease by the
close of this decade, federal health officials predicted Thursday.
   A California study, meanwhile, finds that two out of three
Alzheimer's patients are women and one in four is under 65.
   ``As the U.S. population ages, the public health impact of
dementias is increasing in importance,'' the Centers for Disease
Control said in its weekly report. An estimated 1.6 million
Americans currently suffer from severe dementia _ most often
Alzheimer's disease, but also some with Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's chorea or dementia-inducing strokes, CDC researchers
reported.
   ``By the year 2000, at least 2.3 million persons are expected to
be affected,'' the Atlanta-based agency said.
   The estimated annual cost of care and related expenses for
patients with severe dementia in 1985 was as much as $48 billion,
the CDC said.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder marked by
dementia _ an inability to remember, reason or understand what is
going on. The cause is unknown, and no cure is available.
   A survey of 439 patients with Alzheimer's at six California
treatment centers from 1985-87 showed that 298, or 68 percent, were
women, according to data from the Institute for Aging at the
University of California at San Francisco.
   While the California patients do not represent an accurate
national survey, Alzheimer's is more frequent in women than in men,
said Dr. Charles Helmick, a CDC Alzheimer's expert.
   And while the disease is often regarded as an affliction of the
very old, 106 of the California patients _ or 24 percent _ were
under 65.
   ``It's been recognized it can occur in middle age,'' Helmick
said. ``It's more prevalent among the older population, and age is
certainly a risk factor, but there are people in middle age
affected by this.''
   The largest numbers of Alzheimer's patients in the California
study were in their 70s. Ages of patients ranged from 45 to 92.
   Most of the California patients _ 66 percent _ were referred to
the special treatment centers by family members, most often because
of an obvious memory problem.

   The Communist Party has expelled two special
investigators who earned national fame for their role in a
corruption inquiry in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, one
of the investigators said Thursday.
   Telman Gdlyan said he and and Nikolai Ivanov had been expelled
by a majority vote of Moscow party officials of their local party
cell at a meeting at the General Prosecutor's office Wednesday.
   The two investigators were expelled on charges of violating the
law and for their political activities, Gdlyan said by telephone
Thursday.
   Gdlyan and Ivanov spearheaded an investigation into corruption
in Uzbekistan and won their elections last year to the national
parliament partly on the popularity of their investigation that
reached the Politburo, particularly conservative member Yegor K.
Ligachev.
   Ivanov in May alleged that Ligachev had accepted a bribe, but
for months afterward, a prosecutor said the investigation proved
the allegations were untrue.
   However, the general prosecutor's office, after an eight-month
inquiry, accused the two investigators of forcing confessions and
other improprieties.
   In recent weeks, small groups of citizens have been
demonstrating sporadically near Red Square on behalf of the two
investigators, accusing the party of persecuting the two men.
   Gdlyan said the general prosecutor had provided no charges
against him and Ivanov, and that he believed he had been expelled
from the party in order to destroy efforts to investigate
corruption within the Communist Party.

   South African black leader Nelson Mandela intends
to visit Britain in April, but it is not known if he will talk with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the British Broadcasting Corp.
said Thursday.
   The Foreign Office said it could not confirm the report, and the
BBC did not give the source of its information.
   No exact date was given, but the report said Mandela wants to
visit during Easter. Easter Sunday falls on April 15.
   During the visit, Mandela will address a rally at London's
Wembley Stadium, the BBC said.
   Mandela was released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison as part of
the reforms launched by the white-minority government of President
F.W. de Klerk.
   Mandela has urged the world to continue economic sanctions
against South Africa to maintain pressure for more reform.
   But Mrs. Thatcher, who previously invited Mandela to visit her,
insists easing sanctions would benefit reform by rewarding de Klerk
for the progress he has made.

   Britain's Prince Charles, arriving at an
exhibit after lunching with President Bush, was greeted by
approving demonstrators who applauded his battle for traditional
architecture and hailed him as ``Our Knight in Shining Armor.''
   Emerging from his limousine on the steps of the historic Octagon
House, the Prince of Wales was obviously delighted to be met by a
cluster of placards whose slogans included: ``Hurrah Prince
Charles,'' and ``Humane Architecture _ Happy People.''
   ``He saw the sign, `Shining Knight in Armor,' and he said, ``Gee
Whiz,'' said Thomas J. Eyerman, a member of the Board of Regents of
the American Architectural Foundation, one of the sponsors of the
event.
   ``He was absolutely shocked that in America that people would
have signs talking about architecture, calling him a shining knight
in armor,'' Eyerman said.
   The pro-prince demonstrators told reporters they represented
organizations that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful fight
to save Washington's historic Rhodes Tavern from demolition.
   The prince's objective at Octagon House, used as a temporary
executive mansion by President James Madison after the British army
burned the White House in 1814, was to view an exhibit
commemorating the design of London's St. Paul's Cathedral by the
leading British architect of the 17th century, Sir Christopher Wren.
   Octagon House, built in 1800, is now a museum of the American
Institute of Architects. Charles married his wife, Diana, in St.
Paul's in 1981.
   The prince reacted to the layout of architectural renderings and
models with animation, looking at each exhibit closely, pointing
out details and asking questions of one of his guides, Eric Evans,
dean of St. Paul's.
   The works on display have never before been assembled as a unit
and the prince was quoted by architects with whom he spoke as
hoping they also could be shown in London.
   As the prince was inspecting the exhibit, America's leading
architects gathered at a glittering black-tie gala for a royal
critique of their work.
   On a chill, drizzly day, the 41-year-old heir to the British
throne dined in the White House family quarters with Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   The other luncheon guests included Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, British Ambassador Sir Antony
Acland and Henry Catto, U.S. ambassador to London.
   Bush escorted Charles down a red carpet to his Rolls-Royce
limousine after lunch and shook hands with the prince, who wore a
dark gray, double-breasted pinstripe suit.
   The busy schedule for Charles' one-day Washington visit also
included an embassy reception for alumni of the Marshall Scholars
program, under which the British government pays all costs for
exceptional American students to spend two or three years at
British universities.
   Later, Charles was the star attraction at a sold-out awards
banquet for 1,200 architects, members of Congress, diplomats,
Supreme Court justices and Hollywood celebrities at the National
Building Museum.
   The prince's dinner speech gave him another opportunity to
criticize the worst examples of modern architecture and appeal to
his audience to design more attractive, comfortable buildings that
are scaled to human needs and respect the surrounding landscape.
   Back home, Charles has angered some architects but won the
applause of much of the British public with his contention that the
London skyline has suffered more damage from architects, city
planners and developers than from German bombers in World War II.
   In ``A Vision of Britain,'' a book he published last year,
Charles accused some modern architects of creating ``Frankenstein
monsters, devoid of character, alien and largely unloved.'' He says
some new buildings in London remind him of word processors or
nuclear power plants.
   Honored at the banquet was architect Fay Jones of Fayetteville,
Ark., a former pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright who won the AIA's
prestigious Gold Medal. Bush presented the award to Jones at a
White House ceremony after the lunch for Charles.
   The prince will end a weeklong U.S. tour on Friday, when he
meets with American environmental experts at the British Embassy
before he returns to London.
   Charles began his visit last weekend by playing in two benefit
polo matches at Vero Beach, Fla. He met Wednesday with 100
corporate executives in Charleston, S.C., to promote private
investment in poor urban neighborhoods and plead for business
cooperation in protecting the environment.

   An operative in Oliver North's secret supply
network to the Nicaraguan Contras was indicted Thursday on charges
of failing to report some of his income from arms sales.
   The indictment says that Thomas G. Clines, 61, a business
partner of Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and Albert Hakim
reported receipts of $265,000 for tax year 1985 and $402,513 for
1986 from the arms business and other income sources.
   However, the four-count indictment, returned by a federal grand
jury in Baltimore, alleges that Clines failed to report to the
Internal Revenue Service that he had foreign accounts totaling more
than $10,000.
   Two counts of the indictment accuse him of underreporting the
gross receipts. Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years
imprisonment and $100,000 in fines on conviction.
   The other counts accuse Clines of failing to report his foreign
accounts, with maximum penalties on conviction for each charge of
10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   During the period in question, Hakim set aside more than
$972,000 in commissions for Clines, who is a former CIA agent, in
an offshore entity codenamed C. Tea, according to a congressional
report on the Iran-Contra scandal issued in 1987.
   Clines and his lawyer regard the decision to bring the case as
an ``ill-advised'' step taken by ``overzealous prosecutors,'' said
his attorney, Paula Junghans. Clines intends to defend himself ``to
the fullest,'' she added.
   Sources familiar with the matter say Clines filed an amended tax
return for 1985 in the fall of 1987, nearly a year after the
Iran-Contra affair came into public view, reporting additional
expenses and additional income.
   Clines takes the position that he has reported all his income
from the Contra transactions, say sources familiar with Clines'
situation.
   He collected the money in connection with his work for ``the
Enterprise,'' the complex of foreign corporations and Swiss
accounts which Hakim and Secord used to move money in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Hakim is a key witness in the investigation of Clines, according
to other sources familiar with the investigation. Hakim was placed
on two years' probation and fined $5,000 on Feb. 1 for his role in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   At the request of his friend Secord, Clines helped procure arms
for the Contra rebels starting in 1985. In addition to locating a
European arms dealer as a source of weapons, Clines helped arrange
for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the
rebels.
   Clines worked for the CIA for 30 years. He was an agent in
Southeast Asia, was involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba
and became director of training in the directorate of operations,
also known as the clandestine services.
   He also was a close associate of Edwin Wilson, the former CIA
agent who is serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally
selling guns and explosives to Libya.
   Clines pleaded guilty in 1984 on behalf of his wholly owned
company to inflating bills submitted to the Defense Department for
shipping U.S. military equipment to Egypt. He was fined the maximum
$10,000 and paid the government $100,000 on behalf of his firm,
Systems Services International.

   A KLM airliner being pushed from a terminal at
Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport bumped into the tail of a
Delta Air Lines plane waiting to roll onto a taxiway Wednesday
night.
   Airport spokesman John Braden said there were no injuries, and
slight metal damage to the planes.
   When the mishap occurred shortly before 7:30, passengers for
Delta Flight 405 to Dallas were getting on board for an 8:30 p.m.
departure, said Delta spokesman Bill Berry.
   The KLM plane, Flight 622 for Amsterdam in the Netherlands, was
rescheduled for a 9 p.m. departure, according to a KLM reservations
supervisor.
   Braden said the KLM Boeing 747 was being pushed back from the
gate by a tug when it bumped into the tail of the Delta MD-88.
   ``One of our crewmen on board said, `It felt like we'd hit a
pothole,''' Berry said.
   Questions on the number of passengers on the KLM flight and
other details were referred to a KLM public information telephone
number, but it was not answered Wednesday night.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
President Bush on Thursday that the Israeli government is not
directing new Soviet immigrants into occupied lands, Bush's
spokesman said.
   Shamir's comments, in a morning phone call to Bush, seemed
designed to allay U.S. concerns that stepped up settlement of
Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza could
torpedo fragile peace efforts.
   ``The prime minister stated that Jewish immigration into Israel
was a separate matter from the question of settlements, and that
the Israeli government had no policy of directing where the new
immigrants would live,'' said Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater.
   At the same time, Fitzwater said in a statement, Bush
``reiterated U.S. opposition to any settlement activity.''
   The United States opposes any expansion of settlements in the
territories Israel seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   The Shamir-Bush call came as the Israeli foreign minister, Moshe
Arens, arrived in Washington for a meeting with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III on Friday to discuss prospects for Mideast peace
negotiations.
   Baker has tried for months to arrange a three-way session in
Washington with Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid. It would be followed by talks between Israel and
Palestinian Arabs.
   But Baker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the
agenda and the composition of a Palestinian delegation remained
unsettled.
   ``The time for action is coming very, very close,'' Baker said.
   Meanwhile, Shimon Peres, the Israeli finance minister, told
Cable News Network that the Palestine Liberation Organization has
accepted a formula for a Palestinian delegation.
   Peres, who heads Israel's opposition Labor Party, said it would
be a non-PLO delegation, including one or two Palestinians who were
expelled from Israel and one or two who reside in East Jerusalem.
Israel has refused to negotiate with the PLO.
   Earlier this week, Fitzwater said the administration did not
believe ``that encouraging Soviet emigrants to settle there is
helpful to the peace process.''
   Despite Shamir's denial of any such policy, the Soviet Union
decided this week against allowing direct flights to Israel,
largely because of Arab concerns over the settling of Soviet Jews
in occupied lands.
   In his phone conversation, Shamir ``thanked the president for
U.S. support of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, for
opposing anti-semitism, and for supporting the restoration of
diplomatic relations as well as the establishment of direct flights
between the U.S.S.R. and Israel,'' Fitzwater's statement said.
   Bush ``thanked the prime minister for his statement and said
that the United States would continue to support free emigration
from the Soviet Union,'' the statement added.
   The president also told Shamir he hoped ``the peace process
could move forward'' to pave the way for a proposed meeting soon in
Cairo of Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators.
   Using standing diplomatic language, Fitzwater's statement said
Shamir's call was described by both leaders as ``helpful and
constructive.''

<HEAD>Unocal Agrees to Record Settlement in San Pablo Bay Pollution Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Oil agreed Thursday to a $5.55
million court settlement stemming from the pollution of San Pablo
Bay, in what lawyers called the largest civil penalty in the
history of the federal Clean Water Act.
   The settlement resolves a longstanding dispute over pollution
that environmentalists contended took place between April 1979 and
February 1988 in the bay, which is located about 15 miles northeast
of here and is part of San Francisco Bay.
   ``We're elated,'' said attorney Stephan Volker of the Sierra
Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc. Volker, who filed suit against the
company in 1984, credited the litigation with exposing and halting
``systematic manipulation of the self-monitoring program on which
the Clean Water Act is based.''
   ``This should send a strong message to other polluters: Clean up
your operations or face the prospect of being hauled into court and
paying a substantial penalty,'' Volker said.
   John Barg, the attorney handling the case for Union, which has
been acquired by Unocal, declined to comment on the settlement.
Unocal spokesman Jeff Callender emphasized that the settlement did
not constitute an admission of fault.
   ``The company maintains that many of the alleged violations are
the result of misunderstandings'' regarding provisions of the Clean
Water Act, he said.
   ``We remained confident of our position but the case has dragged
on for six years and we felt it was time to put it behind us,''
Callender said.
   Union Oil employees testified during the dispute that the
company repeatedly and deliberately violated the terms of its waste
water discharge permit and failed to report the violations, Volker
said.
   The settlement followed years of legal battles. Although the
courts initially found in favor of Union's position, subsequent
rulings went against the company.
   In December 1988, U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Conti ruled
that Union Oil had violated its federal waste discharge permit 200
times, including nine bypasses of its treatment plant in the town
of Rodeo. A trial had been scheduled for this month.
   The wastes that flowed into the Bay included phenols and other
potentially cancer-causing substances such as benzene, toluene,
acetone and trichloroethylene. Conti said the company had saved
from $20 million to $60 million by failing to install adequate
treatment equipment.
   The penalty was described by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund
as the highest ever paid as the result of a civil lawsuit under the
federal Clean Water Act. The previous high was $3.2 million awarded
in a New Jersey case last year.
   The settlement includes $2.72 million that Unocal will give the
Trust for Public Land for acquisition and restoration of wetlands
around San Francisco Bay; $1 million to the Environmental
Protection Agency to study the removal of dredge spoils from the
San Francisco Bay; $500,000 to the State of California Water
Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Fund for emergency pollution
cleanup; and $1.33 million in SCLDF court costs.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp, whose office
participated in the litigation, hailed the settlement.
   ``California's strict water quality law was enacted precisely to
prevent this type of environmental abuse,'' he said. ``Our evidence
showed that Unocal repeatedly disregarded this law both by numerous
waste discharge violations and by failing to report them as
required.''
   The company spent $64 million last year to upgrade its
waste-water treatment facilities in the Contra Costa County town of
Rodeo, Callender said.

<HEAD>Ivana Trump's Lawyer Tells All About Her First Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivana Trump's lawyers called a news conference
Wednesday to tell reporters what she had yet to tell her three
children: She was married before.
   ``They never slept together,'' said Mrs. Trump's attorney,
Michael Kennedy. ``They never lived together.''
   The 1971 marriage was legally dissolved in Los Angeles in 1973.
   The latest Trump revelation since billionaire developer Donald
Trump announced he was leaving his wife came in response to
``inaccurate'' reports published in the British tabloids, Kennedy
said.
   Kennedy would not say what the inaccuracies were, but he said
Mrs. Trump's first husband was 25 when they married and alive
today. The Sun of London had reported he was 60 and died within two
years of the marriage.
   Kennedy also declined to answer questions about the Trump's
prenuptial agreement, which reportedly would give Mrs. Trump $25
million, their house in Connecticut and custody of the three Trump
children.
   He refused to discuss whether the Trumps were talking to each
other. And he declined to talk about a possible out-of-court
agreement that would give Mrs. Trump a bigger settlement.
   But he was ready to answer some questions about Alfred
Winklmayr, Mrs. Trump's ex-husband.
   Winklmayr and Mrs. Trump, then 25 and 22 respectively, married
in a civil ceremony in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in November 1971,
according to Kennedy.
   He said it was a ``Cold War marriage'' that allowed the
then-Mrs. Winklmayr to travel under an Austrian passport in and out
of communist Czechoslovakia.
   Winklmayr, a ski instructor, and Mrs. Trump, a former
world-class skier, remain friends, Kennedy said.
   Winklmayr returned to Austria after the marriage and Mrs. Trump
went back to Prague where she completed her master's degree. She
emigrated to Canada in September 1972.
   Kennedy refused to say who filed for the divorce or where it was
obtained, but Mrs. Trump's spokesman John Scanlon said Winklmayr
filed for divorce in Superior Court in Los Angeles in December
1972. It was finalized in August 1973.
   Mrs. Trump did not know Donald Trump at the time, Kennedy said.
He added that Trump knew about the marriage.
   ``It's not a fact that anyone is trying to conceal,'' Kennedy
said, although he said the Trump's children _ ages 12, 8 and 6 _
did not know about the marriage prior to the reports in the British
tabloids.
   ``These are young children we're talking about,'' he said.
   The Sun, a brassy tabloid, said in what it tagged an exclusive
report that Winkelmayr was 37 years Ivana's senior when he married
her, but that he died within two years of the marriage and left her
enough money to finance ``a new life in Canada.''
   It referred to him as ``Herr Winkelmayr'' and did not give him a
first name. Herr is mister in German.

<TEXT>
   An unmanned Ariane 44-L rocket with
two Japanese telecommunications satellites aboard exploded shortly
after blasting off Thursday from the Ariane space center.
   The four-engine rocket blew up because of what appeared to be a
fire in the propulsion system, but the precise cause was not
immediately clear, Arianespace President Frederic D'Allest said.
   He said all Ariane flights were being suspended until the cause
of the accident was determined.
   The failure came after 17 straight successful launches of the
Ariane. The two satellites alone were insured for nearly $240
million.
   An Associated Press reporter and other witnesses who saw the
flight on TV monitors at the agency's headquarters in Evry, France,
said flames appeared to break out in the first stage of the rocket
before it was due to separate at two minutes, 30 seconds into
flight.
   They also said that flames from one rocket booster unexpectedly
burned into the scaffolding supporting the vehicle as it lifted
off, but there was no indication this had any bearing on the
explosion.
   ``A mishap in the function of the first stage led to the loss of
mission flight 36, one minute, 40 seconds into launch,''
Arianespace said in a statement released in Paris.
   The rocket exploded about 6.2 miles from the launch pad at an
altitude of 5.6 miles, the statement said.
   ``We are going to analyze the failure ... as rapidly as
possible,'' said D'Allest.
   Arianespace, a consortium of European companies, took over the
commercialization of the Ariane program from the European Space
Agency in 1980. It is responsible for building, operating and
marketing launch services.
   Ariane shots have become routine, with successful missions about
once a month. The reliability of the program has made Arianespace
the world's leading provider of commercial launch services, holding
more than 50 percent of the lucrative international market.
   The French space minister, Paul Quilles, said the explosion
should not cast doubt on the Ariane program, which he noted had had
an ``exceptional'' run.
   ``The risk of a failure is always present at each launch. It's
part of the business,'' Quilles said.
   The first stage of the three-stage vehicle holds the strap-on
boosters, fueled by a nitrogen-oxygen compound, that should have
thrust the 190-foot, 582-ton vehicle into orbit.
   The rocket lifted off from this French overseas department in
northeast South America at 8:17 p.m. local time (6:17 p.m. EST),
tracing a graceful pattern over the launch site.
   It was about six miles above the Atlantic Ocean when the blast
ripped it apart, D'Allest said. Wind blowing fuel back toward
Kourou forced residents to stay indoors.
   Thursday's launch was the 36th Ariane mission since the first
launch in the unmanned space program on on Dec. 24, 1979.
   The explosion was the first since the 18th Ariane flight blew up
May 31, 1986, and the first of the rocket series since its maiden
launch June 15, 1988.
   Forty-three satellites have been launched, and another 32 are
scheduled for future launch with a contract value of $2.36 billion.
   In all, five Ariane rockets have failed in flight previously.
The others were the second mission on May 23, 1980, the fifth on
Sept. 10, 1982 in the presence of President Francois Mitterrand,
and the 15th on Sept. 13, 1985.
   The launch of the two communications satellites marked the first
time an Ariane mission carried an all-Japanese payload. One
satellite, the BS2K, was built by U.S. company General Electric's
aero-space division to direct broadcasting for Japan's national NHK
network.
   The other, a Superbird B, was built by Ford Aerospace to channel
telephone, telegraph and telex messages. It was owned by
Mitsubishi's subsidiary Space Communications Corp.
   The BS2K satellite was insured for $150 million to $180 million,
Arianespace said, while the Superbird B was insured for about $60
million.
   Jungi Inoue of the Space Communications Corp. put the launch and
insurance costs in the range of $600 million.

   A federal judge overturned a law passed by
Congress to prohibit desecration of the flag, ruling that
Americans' right to burn their flag must be protected as
energetically as their right to wave it.
   Prosecutors said the challenge to the Flag Protection Act of
1989 may be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In dismissing flag burning charges against four people, U.S.
District Judge Barbara Rothstein on Wednesday ruled that the new
federal law is unconstitutional.
   ``In order for the flag to endure as a symbol of freedom in this
nation, we must protect with equal vigor the right to destroy it
and the right to wave it,'' she said.

   Avianca pilots told controllers four times
that they were running out of fuel before their jetliner crashed in
New York, killing 73 people, but federal safety officials say that
wasn't enough.
   The National Transportation Safety Board issued an urgent
recommendation Wednesday that pilots and air traffic controllers
make sure they understand each other clearly in potential emergency
situations.
   Pilots of the Colombian airliner in the Jan. 25 flight
apparently tried to tell controllers of an emergency condition but
failed to use the language required by the Federal Aviation
Administration, the NTSB said.
   The board asked the FAA to notify all airliners using U.S. skies
their pilots must be ``thoroughly knowledgeable'' of required
communications when fuel emergencies and other critical problems

   With the Argentine austral losing
value by as much as 25 percent a day, the U.S. dollar has become
the preferred currency in many Buenos Aires shops, stores and
showrooms.
   Some businesses refuse to accept the austral altogether. Many
others price their goods only in dollars but allow customers to pay
in australs at their current value against the dollar.
   ``The price list arrives in dollars and we charge customers in
dollars because the factory insists it be paid in dollars,'' said
Roberto Molinelli, 48, a Ford salesman.
   ``When the distributor delivers a case of champagne, I pay in
cash,'' said Ernesto Merin, 24, owner of an upscale boutique. ``If
not, I have a week or two weeks to pay _ never 30 days anymore _
but when I pay, it's in dollars or the dollar amount in australs.''
   Argentines have been stashing dollars away as a hedge against a
soaring inflation. An estimated $5 billion is tucked away in
strongboxes or under mattresses and $50 billion more is in overseas
banks.
   During the past year, the austral has lost 99 percent of its
value against the dollar.
   In February, 1989, it took just 17 australs to buy one dollar;
at one point this February it took 4,100 _ meaning the dollar
increased more than 24,000 percent in value.
   Argentines' salaries generally are increased monthly in line
with inflation, which rose by 4,924 percent in 1989, and 8,124
percent the past 12-month period.
   For some time, automobiles, apartments, jewelry, furs, airline
tickets and other expensive items have been priced in dollars by
retailers wary of inflation.
   But as the cost-of-living this year approached 80 percent a
month, stores that sell records, leather handbags, eyeglasses,
gifts, dinnerware and a host of similar items _ many made in
Argentina _ now charge in dollars, or the equivalent in australs.
   ``We use dollars as a base,'' said optician Jorge Romero, 26,
whose shop is on fashionable Florida St. in downtown Buenos Aires.
``It's so much easier. Otherwise, we'd be changing prices several
times a day.''
   Dentists, doctors, lawyers, economic consultants, car mechanics,
carpenters and TV repairmen, even housemaids, charge in dollars or
the equivalent in australs.
   Unions representing schoolteachers have requested that they be
paid the equivalent of $100 a month. The government has ignored
such requests because it lacks the dollars to comply.
   Perhaps the biggest problem for business has been what price to
charge.
   ``I called the factory last month to find out how much it would
cost to replace some games they sold me,'' said Merin, the boutique
owner. ``They quoted me a price in dollars. When I checked the
price I was selling them for in australs, I found I was selling at
cost. ... Now I price everything in dollars.''
   When inflation roared to a monthly record of 197 percent in
July, pharmacies, hardware and other stores shut down rather than
sell too low.
   That, along with the withholding of deliveries by distributors
and hoarding by customers, has disrupted the commercial supply
chain across this nation of 31 million people, as has the refusal
of most stores now to accept credit cards.
   The apparent solution was to price goods directly in dollars.
   But that has put the vast majority of Argentines who earn
salaries in australs at a severe disadvantage.
   ``After I got paid for January, I paid my rent and utility
bills, then divided the rest by the number of days in the month,''
said a newspaper reporter. ``Now, what I have left is hardly enough
to eat on.''
   Typical salaries in January ranged from 200,000 australs for
teachers and other public servants, to 1 million australs for lower
level managers and shopowners. The dollar value of those salaries
eroded from $100-$500 on Feb. 1 to $50-$250 three weeks later.
   ``This will be the worst year for me,'' said Juan Dainese, 43,
manager of one of Buenos Aires' oldest bookstores. ``People don't
have any money. It's as simple as that.''

<HEAD>ABC's `Challenger' Docudrama A Winner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was inevitable that someone would make a TV
movie based on the Challenger space shuttle tragedy.
   Strange thing, though. Unlike many docudramas, writer-producer
George Englund's effort, with a cast that includes Barry Bostwick,
Karen Allen and Peter Boyle, offers taste, restraint, sensitivity
and a fair amount of attention to detail.
   Opposed by many family members of the crew, some of whom call it
an invasion of their privacy, ``Challenger,'' which airs Sunday on
ABC, is anything but exploitative in relating the events leading up
to the disaster that shocked the world on Jan. 28, 1986.
   It doesn't even have what you'd expect for the finale, the fiery
blast that destroyed the Challenger and killed its seven-member
crew, among them Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher.
   Instead, it ends with the start of the launch, with the actors
in the shuttle reciting lines from John Gillespie Magee's famous
poem on flying, the one that begins, ``Oh, I have slipped the surly
bonds of earth ...''
   The three-hour film juggles two tasks: dramatizing the lives of
the key Challenger figures, as well as the behind-the-scenes events
in what became the worst accident in the history of America's space
program.
   It generally does both well, having the benefits of Englund's
spare, taut script, Glenn Jordan's tight direction and _ an equally
important factor _ the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration's advice and cooperation.
   The cast is first-rate, particularly Bostwick as mission
commander Dick Scobee, Allen as the bubbly but determined McAuliffe
and Boyle as a worried engineer at Morton-Thiokol, Inc., builder of
the shuttle's booster rockets.
   With short scenes that start with the crew members and their
mates the day before the launch, the movie shifts back and forth
from the technical side to the crew's personal lives and their
training for the Challenger flight.
   The technical scenes involve the worries of Boyle and his
colleagues about the emerging possibility of failure on the part of
the now-infamous O-rings, which seal the rockets. It also shows the
resistance that he and his engineers faced from their bosses, and
then NASA officials, at the most crucial time.
   On the personal side, there are good, concise sketches of each
astronaut, including the other woman on Challenger, Dr. Judith
Resnik (Julie Fulton), a veteran of an earlier shuttle flight.
   And, of course, the show follows McAuliffe through her wide-eyed
introduction to the space world, and opposition to her by one
astronaut, Ellison S. Onizuka (Keone Young), who flatly opposes
amateurs in space.
   There are only two scenes of flight in conventional aircraft,
but each is well-done, particularly one in which Bostwick takes
Allen aloft in a T-38 jet trainer. The idea is to give her the feel
of G-forces, the pull of gravity she'll experience aboard the
Challenger at lift-off.
   It's a beautifully filmed passage, imparting a real sense of the
sheer joy of flight as it shows her startled, then delighted,
reactions to a few rolls and loops. ``I've never known anything
like this,'' she says with a laugh.
   Bostwick, as the friendly, unflappable Scobee, smiles. ``There
isn't anything like this,'' he says, urging her to do ``something
you can tell the kids about.'' Then he informs her she now has the
controls.
   She over-controls the jet, naturally. Then Englund cheats a bit,
showing her putting it through a slow roll after only a few
minutes' stick time.
   But it's still a lovely scene. So is another, on the ground
inside a NASA shuttle simulator, in which the flight's sole black
astronaut, Ron McNair (Joe Morton), talks his young son through a
pretend launch.
   Not all of ``Challenger'' works. Two wholly fictional scenes,
each involving McAuliffe, don't ring true and slow things down.
   But they're exceptions to a first-class production that covers a
lot of material with only one noticeable omission _ that shuttle
flights, begun in 1981, had become so seemingly routine by 1986
that ABC, CBS and NBC didn't even air a live telecast of
Challenger's launch.
   There was no press mob at the Kennedy Space Center then. Only
500 news staffers were there when the flight ended in disaster.
   Several years later, when the first shuttle mission since the
tragedy was scheduled, NASA estimated that 5,000 showed up to cover
the launch of the Discovery.

<HEAD>Private Companies Buy Life Insurance Policies of Terminally Ill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom has AIDS, and he was sinking fast.
   He lost his job, and his monthly Social Security checks didn't
begin to cover his rent, food, medical expenses and other bills.
The former real-estate salesman was in real danger of losing his
home.
   Then the 34-year-old Boston man heard about an upstart company
that buys the life insurance policies of terminally ill patients at
a discount, cashing in when they die.
   Tom, who asked that his last name not be used, sold his $100,000
policy for about $53,000. ``I think it's a great idea,'' he said.
``It benefits the person who is suffering.''
   ``We've had a few people that say this is ghoulish,'' said Rob
T. Worley Sr., who started Living Benefits Inc. with his son, Rob
Jr. ``But once they think about it, they change their mind.''
   Living Benefits, based in Albuquerque, N.M., requires
prospective clients to provide evidence that they have 18 months or
less to live.
   The company usually pays 55 percent to 80 percent of a policy's
face value, depending on factors such as how long the person is
expected to live and prevailing interest rates. In return,
customers list Living Benefits as their sole beneficiary.
   Since the Worleys bought their first policy last April, at least
two other for-profit companies have opened their doors: American
Life Resources Corp. in Miami and Beat the Grim Reaper
International in New York.
   ``I don't think there's anything as guaranteed as this is in
terms of getting a return,'' said Herman H. Silverman, a high
school English teacher who started Beat the Grim Reaper last fall
as a part-time business in his home.
   ``As long as they're going right now anyway, there's a service
that I can provide for people who want to have their money right
now,'' Silverman said.
   The life insurance industry recently started offering its own
version of living benefits.
   Prudential announced last month a plan that would let
policyholders with six months or less to live get the bulk of their
life insurance proceeds before they die. But the plan is available
in only 10 states.
   Other companies have taken steps toward living benefits, but
usually allow policyholders to withdraw no more than half the
policy's face value, and then often only in monthly installments.
   As might be expected, the industry is ambivalent about
entrepreneurs venturing onto their turf.
   ``We recognize there's a desperate need. The high cost of dying
just goes up every year,'' said Robert Waldron, spokesman for the
American Council of Life Insurance. ``On the other hand, this gives
a third party who's not family an economic interest in a
policyholder's death. As a concept, that is dangerous.''
   If more insurance companies follow Prudential's lead, he said,
he expects ``that those private companies would very swiftly lose
their market.''
   But the private companies don't think so.
   American Life Resources started accepting applications last fall
and bought its first policy last month.
   ``It would be my great pleasure to take the shingle off the
door,'' said its president, Steven Simon. But then he tells how, as
a volunteer with an AIDS buddy program, the first person he visited
was sleeping on a bare floor. The man had been forced to sell his
bed.
   ``This is a story that's being told every day in every part of
this country,'' Simon said. ``People in the prime of their lives
are having every dignity that you and I take for granted just
robbed from them.''
   Worley said his company has saved at least six homes from
foreclosure since beginning operations. Living Benefits has bought
about 50 policies, about 50 purchases are pending and about 200
applications are out, he said.
   Silverman would not disclose how many policies Grim Reaper has
bought.
   All three companies say the most interest comes from people with
AIDS, mainly because AIDS groups have a well-developed national
information network.
   Simon and Worley say they do no advertising. Silverman has
advertised in the classified section of a New York-based gay
newsmagazine, and also distributed fliers once at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in Manhattan. He said
administrators there ``went into a panic.''
   ``Inside of about a day or two, they managed to collect all of
my stuff and called to inform me they had thrown it out,''
Silverman said. ``These people just have an aversion to dealing
with the financial aspect of terminal illness.''
   A hospital spokeswoman said she could not confirm the story or
comment further.
   The entrepreneurs concede they are wandering into mostly
uncharted legal territory. New Mexico is the only state to have
regulated the new industry, adopting for the most part the policies
the Worleys developed in 2{ years of researching the concept.
   ``We wanted to be regulated,'' Worley said. ``All states need to
regulate this just to be sure that people are not being taken
advantage of.''
   That wasn't a concern for Fred, a 59-year-old San Diego man with
cancer who sold his $250,000 policy to Living Benefits for about 65
cents on the dollar. Fred, who also asked that his last name not be
used, is spending some of the proceeds to build a new house for his
wife.
   ``It's like having your cake and eating it too,'' he said. ``As
far as I'm concerned, I'm going to keep living.''

<HEAD>Schools Use February To Focus on Black History</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight-year-old Erik Hundley of South Nyack,
N.Y., rattles off the civil rights struggles of Martin Luther King
Jr. after a week of study but admits, ``I forgot who Harriet Tubman
was.''
   Sameena Parveen, 13, an eighth grader at Kettering Middle School
in Largo, Md., is intrigued with the underground railroad movement
and the role of a virtual unknown, John Henry.
   And, 12-year-old LaKeisha Lewis of Spencer, Okla., becomes
``sort of angry'' when she thinks about ``how the civil rights
thing came about ... because I don't think people should be treated
like that.''
   The study of black American heroes and heroines went into high
gear in schools this month, as it does every February, in
recognition of Black History Month. Although started in 1926 by
Carter G. Woodson in recognition of the birthdays of Abraham
Lincoln and Frederick Douglas, celebration of the special month
gained momentum when King's birthday became a national holiday.
   Now, King's January birthday is used as the springboard into
February's recognition of other black leaders during special school
assemblies, field trips, classroom projects, book reports, skits
and plays.
   ``It's good there's a month to remember the accomplishments of
the blacks,'' said Sameena, a native of India. ``Some students
don't seem to care, and some people do change their attitudes
(toward other races). I think most of the students only act like
they really care and then quickly forget.''
   Bernadine Lyles of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the
nation's second largest after New York, said many of the 646
schools start with the King holiday to go into their program on
black Americans.
   ``That holiday has created much more awareness,'' said Ms.
Lyles, instructional adviser of the elementary level for the
multicultural unit of the Office of Instruction. ``Most students
have some idea of the Civil Rights movement and its effect on
African American history and culture.''
   San Francisco schools spokeswoman Madelaine Eaton said all
64,000 students participate in a Martin Luther King essay contest
as part of Black History Month. The district, which is 20 percent
black, also offers students and teachers an array of black American
art and language resources but each school is left to develop its
own particular programs.
   In some other states, the teaching of black history is
determined mainly by the size of the black student body and by the
interests of the teachers.
   At Community High School in Carbondale, Ill., English teacher
Anna Jackson said there are no special assemblies for either King's
birthday or Black History Month.
   ``I really try to integrate black history throughout the year''
by incorporating the works of blacks and other minorities in the
classroom assignments, said Ms. Jackson, one of six minority
teachers. About 30 percent of the 1,000 students at the school are
black or Asian.
   To her dismay, though, the school usually gives semester exams
during the days leading up to King's birthday ``so the kids are
focusing on preparing for the exam.''
   At the private all-girl La Reine High School in the Washington,
D.C., suburb of Suitland, Md., Sister Kateri said it is a
frustrating struggle to keep up with the changing needs of the 475
young women. The student body was 12 percent black in 1973 and is
now 63 percent black. Three of the 42 faculty members are black.
   ``I would say that (the study of black history) has come slowly
but we have tried to integrate it as much as possible,'' said
Sister Kateri. ``I think it all depends how strong a teacher might
be inclined toward spending the individual time, although there has
been a definite push for this.''
   For others, the King holiday underscores the need to include
other cultures in school curriculum and textbooks.
   Clayborne Carson, a former civil rights activist who is editor
of King's papers _ a 15-year project that is expected to result in
publication of 12 volumes of King's writings and speeches _ said
that in many schools the black history focus is merely token.
   ``It's like we created the occasion before we knew what we were
going to do with it,'' said Carson, who is at American University
this semester as a Visiting Landmarks Scholar in American History.
``It's going to be a long process moving from tokenism to
meaningful content. We've just begun that process.''
   Nannette McGee, consultant for social studies education in the
Georgia Department of Education, said that although textbooks have
been written about blacks in America, ``It just seems that ... they
became old and out of date and they were not used because of that.''
   Social studies textbooks have not been updated in five years,
she said.
   Murdell McFarlin of the Atlanta Public Schools agreed.
   ``School officials aren't replacing the books right now because
it's not the state-scheduled time, but they are supplementing them
with essays and other information,'' said Mrs. McFarlin.
   Iowa in 1976 became the first state to pass a law mandating that
school curriculum incorporate contributions of minorities and women.
   In New York, state Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol recently
announced plans to draft broad revisions in the state's public
school curriculum to give greater recognition to the contributions
of non-white cultures to American society. The changes would affect
the state's 2.5 million public schoolchildren.
   Ellen Swartz, multicultural project coordinator in the
Rochester, N.Y., school district, said the district has been
working for three years designing and producing classroom materials
about groups that are usually misrepresented or omitted in
textbooks and other educational materials. While most of the
material developed is used voluntarily by the teachers, she said
officials now are working on a ninth grade textbook on Africans.
   ``Rochester has taken a step past many districts that I've seen.
Not in intent but in actions,'' said Ms. Swartz. ``What we are
doing that's different is committing the resources and dollars. We
are solidly on the cutting edge of movement in this area.''
   Jack Gaffney, social studies program coordinator for the San
Diego Unified School District, said the district tries to
incorporate ``a strong multicultural strand'' into the curriculum
``all the way down through kindergarten.''
   ``It's a matter of infusing things, where they would normally
occur in history, in the curriculum to increase the depths of
cultural studies,'' said Gaffney.
   Marlowe Teig, who for 22 years worked with a number of textbook
publishers, said many schools are unable to puchase up-to-date
textbooks that reflect black history. School and community
officials also are not clear about what they want in the textbooks
and fail to list the criteria, he added.
   Developing textbooks that reflect the role of blacks and others
in American society is more than ``just mentioning all the
leaders'' or ``taking a paragraph out and plugging another one
in,'' he said.
   ``You have to be more reflective. Textbooks are not like USA
Today. They don't line the garbage cans tomorrow. They are going to
be around for years. They affect children's lives.''

   Trucks rumble down dirt trails to service
the wells that have sprouted in this dusty, cactus-filled backwood.
Dealmakers cram the local hotels, and one eatery has installed
tabletop telephones for them.
   Oil, the one-time backbone of the Texas economy that fractured
in the late 1980s because of a world supply glut, has mended.
Spurred by new technology and higher prices, this part of oil
country is growing at a pace unseen in years.
   Some have dubbed it ``the new Spindletop,'' recalling the first
Texas gusher, because record flows have come from wells tapped late
last year using horizontal drilling techniques that maximize
chances of a find.
   But more cautious folks, humbled by short-lived booms in the
past, aren't so effusive.
   ``You don't see all the new pickups running up and down the road
that you did'' during past upswings, said Inez Asher, a former
mayor of Dilley. The town of 2,500 people is at the center of the
Pearsall Field activity about 80 miles southwest of San Antonio.
   Ms. Asher herself was about to leave Dilley until she returned
from a vacation last August to find a resurgence.
   Land lease prices rose from $50 an acre last year to as much as
$450. The county courthouse in Pearsall stays open late at night to
accommodate landmen searching records.
   At the Porterhouse Inn in Pearsall, one of the few hotels in the
area, rooms are at a premium _ one resembled a miniature office
with a map of the area taped to the wall and a typewriter nearby.
``We could rent 60 more (rooms) if we had 'em,'' said a desk clerk.
   Rental housing has been swallowed up by workers coming to join
the boom.
   ``Oil has brought an opportunity to get a quality job,'' said
Pearsall City Manager Andres Garza Jr. Oil rig workers earn about
$9 an hour, nearly triple what local farmhands make.
   At Pappa's, a truckstop and bus station along Interstate 35,
phones were installed at the tables for the land dealers who gather
there.
   Sales tax collections have doubled; bank deposits are up 20
percent.
   So is traffic. ``We're really beginning to need a red light,''
Ms. Asher said.
   ``Business has tripled, and it's all oil,'' said innkeeper
Shirley Young. She and her husband run the Dilley Hotel and
Restaurant, a bed-and-breakfast inn now base camp for many oilmen.
   Once, ``we just figured we were going to dry up and blow away,''
she said. Now ``it's hard to keep an ample food supply.''
   Booms have been seen before in the Austin Chalk, the geological
formation that includes the Pearsall Field, but the area earned the
nickname ``Heartbreak Field'' because one well would produce and
another nearby would come up dry.
   The oil there is found in vertical fractures that left little
room for mistake.
   Horizontal wells, which make a 90-degree turn more than a mile
underground, can link several vertical formations, increasing
chances for success. The main question is how long the increased
production rates will be maintained. Some experts expect the wells
may expire faster than vertical wells.
   While horizontal wells are credited for the Austin Chalk
recovery, the rebound elsewhere in Texas is linked to oil prices
that have remained relatively steady at more than $20 a barrel for
months, which is considered a sign of strength in the energy market.
   The oil industry has been hoping for a return to this stability
since prices collapsed to about $10 a barrel in 1986, weakened by
the increased production of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   That drop traumatized oil drillers and especially hurt Texas,
which had been thriving based on projections of oil fetching $30
and $40 a barrel or more.
   Many drillers simply cut their losses by capping wells, some
sought bankruptcy and others liquidated. Unemployment soared, land
values tumbled, banks faltered and the state became a nationwide
symbol of hard times.
   The oil rebound, conversely, has encouraged many companies to
increase spending for exploration. The resurgence even has drillers
and service companies worried about finding qualified people to
work the rigs, also in somewhat short supply.
   For the first time in four or five years, the industry last
December ran short of rigs used to improve existing wells, said
Harry Spannous, director of the Permian Basin Petroleum
Association. The association is based in Midland, headquarters of
the West Texas oilfield containing about a quarter of the oil and
gas reserves in the lower 48 states.
   Baker-Hughes Inc.'s rig count, an index of exploratory
operations, reflects the new activity: as of Feb. 2, 83 rigs were
working in the Texas section of the Permian Basin, vs. 57 a year
ago; in East Texas, 57 were looking for oil and gas, compared with
39 last year.
   Those increases are slight compared with the growth in the
Pearsall Field: one rig last year; 38 now. Production has more than
doubled, and new discoveries are announced weekly.
   Oryx Energy Co. of Dallas pioneered the process in the region,
persuading the industry-regulating Texas Railroad Commission to
increase allowables _ the amount of oil that can be pumped from the
ground _ and the space required between wells.
   Since Oryx went before the commission in August, revealing its
success with horizontal drilling, companies have flocked to the
field, even though Oryx had acquired leases on much of the prime
drilling area before showing its hand, said Jim Roberts, the
company's vice president of production.
   Although rivals are drilling scores of wells, nobody has matched
Oryx's perfect record at finding oil with horizontal wells.
   Still, there have been some spectacular results, topped by
Charlie Winn.
   The old-style wildcatter has tapped two major wells on an
8,900-acre lease and has three more under way. The first well is
producing 5,472 barrels of oil a day, a state record, and the
second is producing better than 3,600 barrels.
   ``The oil business is fun again,'' Winn said.

   In the fall of 1969, then-Sen. Gaylord Nelson
suggested offhandedly in a speech in Seattle that Americans hold a
``teach-in'' to promote concern for their air, land and water.
   ``By the time I got back to Washington, my phone was ringing off
the hook,'' Nelson said recently.
   Nelson's teach-in, dubbed Earth Day, counted 20 million
participants at rallies and campus music festivals and launched the
American environmental movement.
   Its 20th anniversary celebration, planned for April 22 and
intended to inject new life into the movement after the punishing
Reagan years, promises to be a slightly chaotic free-for-all, with
more committees, organizers and sponsors than anyone can count.
   There is much to celebrate. In the decade following Earth Day,
Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and passed the
Clean Water Act, a tougher Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species
Act, and other landmark legislation.
   Then times grew bleak.
   Ronald Reagan's secretary of the interior, James Watt, fought to
open western lands to development, over environmentalists'
objections. EPA Administrator Anne Burford presided over
substantial cuts in the agency's budget, and the White House
Council on Environmental Quality was cut from 50 people to eight.
One of Reagan's most quoted environmental observations was that
trees produce pollution.
   ``The 1980s were the most self-indulgent decade this country has
seen this century. And it knew better,'' said George Schaller, a
wildlife biologist with Wildlife Conservation International in New
York.
   ``There's much more interest, much more understanding, much more
concern now than there was then,'' in 1970, said Nelson, the former
senator and governor of Wisconsin, now with the Wilderness Society
in Washington, D.C.
   The anniversary observance, Nelson said, will succeed ``as a
grass-roots explosion of activity, as it did in 1970.''
   Two entirely separate national organizations have arisen to plan
activities for Earth Day 1990 and for Earth Week, which leads up to
it. They are called Earth Day 20 Foundation and Earth Day 1990, and
Nelson is honorary chairman of both.
   ``Hopefully, we've got a pretty friendly competition going
here,'' said Edward Furia, director of the Earth Day 20 Foundation.
``The capitalist system does produce innovation. If there was only
one group, we wouldn't feel like maybe we had to work as hard.''
   The centerpiece of Furia's campaign is a week of environmental
exhibits, lectures and performances by rock, country and jazz
musicians. The festival will be held in a natural amphitheater at
the side of the Columbia Gorge in the town of George, Wash. (No
kidding.)
   Dick Clark has agreed to serve as host of the festival's music,
which will be broadcast by satellite to vast screens set up in
shopping centers across the country, Furia said.
   He said he still was negotiating with performers, but among
those who have promised to take part are actress Cybill Shepherd,
singers Willie Nelson and John Cougar Mellencamp and jazz pianist
Michel Petrucciani. He promises a couple of surprise superstars.
   ``The concept is that every day you would have exhibits in the
morning people can walk through,'' Furia said. ``Then we would move
into the entertainment area.''
   Denis Hayes, director of Earth Day 1990, is laying the
groundwork not only for a celebration in major cities on Earth Day
but also for educational and political campaigns that he intends to
continue after the celebration is over.
   Among the activities planned by Hayes are:
   _Collecting signatures on a ``green pledge'' encouraging
individuals to recycle, save energy and water, buy products least
harmful to the environment and support environmental legislation.
   _A ``Global Cities Project'' to help pass laws for recycling,
ridesharing, energy and water conservation, and waste management.
More than 70 cities have signed up.
   _An ``environmental exploration'' of homes by primary and
secondary school students, a homework lesson in which children and
their parents look for opportunities to conserve energy and water,
recycle and reduce reliance on toxic substances.
   _An environmental audit program for colleges, in which students
can assess campus administrative policies regarding conservation,
recycling and pollution. Six hundred colleges are participating.
   _The establishment of a global alliance between U.S. Earth Day
organizers and more than 1,200 groups in 116 countries. The
environmental problems of the 1990s, such as ozone depletion and
global warming, ``are things that can't be solved by any one
nation,'' Hayes said.
   _Promotion of the ``Valdez principles,'' an environmental code
of conduct for corporations, modeled after the Sullivan principles
governing business dealings in South Africa.
   The Sullivan principles required corporations to treat black and
white employees equitably and to provide job training for blacks.
The Valdez principles, named after the Valdez, Alaska, oil spill,
would require corporations to produce environmentally benign
products, clean up spills and submit to outside ``audits'' to
ensure compliance with environmental laws.
   Furia's plans, beyond the satellite broadcast into shopping
malls of the Earth Week festival from Washington state, include an
``international peace climb'' of Mount Everest, with climbers from
the United States, China and the Soviet Union.
   The climbers, led by Jim Whittaker, the first American to scale
Everest, plan to clean up trash left on the mountain by past
expeditions.
   Furia also is promoting educational programs in schools and
colleges, in cooperation with local chapters of the National Toxics
Campaign, headquartered in Boston.
   The National Toxics Campaign, an environmental group that has
fought against the use of pesticides and the release of industrial
toxins, is seeking signatures on a ``good neighbor agreement,''
pledging private and public organizations to reduce emissions of
toxic wastes.
   But the heart of Earth Day will be the local and state
observances, Nelson said.
   ``There will be lots of demonstration projects of all kinds,''
he said. ``You'll get speeches, peaceful demonstrations. You'll
have high schools and grade schools running programs for a week or
a month, planting trees, things like that.''
   People seeking information on Earth Day activities should call
their governor's office, the local office of the Environmental
Protection Agency, or a nearby university, Nelson said.
   The success of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day will be
measured partly by the number of people who participate, Nelson
said.
   As he explained when he announced the campaign last year: ``The
most important single objective of Earth Day 1990 is a monumental,
worldwide demonstration, by several hundred million people, that
literally shakes the political leadership of the world out of its
lethargy.''

<HEAD>Experimental Operation Helps People With Balance Disorder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clayton Forster had lost one job because of
chronic vertigo and was about to lose another. Then an experimental
operation restored his balance by destroying a balance organ that
had gone haywire.
   ``I'd have an attack maybe once every few months where I would
be actually on the floor,'' said Forster, who suffers from
Meniere's disease. ``But I would be under attack maybe months at a
time, very mildly.''
   ``You had to be on your toes. Things were shifting.''
   Doctors don't know what causes the disease, which was first
described a century ago by a French physician. It attacks the
semicircular canals _ a major part of the body's balance system _
three tiny, sharply bent tubes in the ear filled with a thick fluid
and lined with hair cells that sense any motion in that fluid.
   About 40 million Americans suffer from the attacks, said Dr.
Ronald Amedee, a Tulane University Medical School ear, nose and
throat specialist. ``It's as though the ear is committing suicide.
... The vestibular organ is sending nonsense to the brain.''
   It can be terrible nonsense.
   The worst attacks ``would start with a howling and ringing in my
ears,'' Forster said. ``Then, everything would be spinning. It
would be as though the floor turned up and became the ceiling; like
the rug was pulled out from under me on my right side. ... I would
start to shake and sweat, then I would start throwing up. I would
fall down, always on my left side, unable to get up again until the
attack was over.''
   A low-sodium diet, diuretics or motion sickness medicine control
attacks for 30 million to 32 million people, but if 1{ to two years
of other treatments don't help, it's time to consider surgery,
Amedee said.
   Forster, 30, was in the Navy when his first mild attacks began
in 1982. ``My job was to launch attack aircraft from the deck of
the USS Eisenhower. ... I had to get up on top of the aircraft to
check the ... hydraulic lines while the engine was running, on top
of the carrier deck on the open sea.''
   A supervisor saw him staggering, figured he was drunk, and sent
him to sick bay, Forster said. ``The base physician said, `Son,
you're not drunk. You've got something wrong with your inner ear.'''
   Forster ultimately had to leave the Navy because of the
increasing vertigo. He was allowed to return after a 1985 operation
in which doctors drilled a tiny hole to drain excess fluid from his
inner ear into his brain cavity. That helped for about eight months
and the Navy discharged him.
   Many doctors have abandoned that technique because it so often
brings little or only temporary relief, Amedee said. Another widely
used operation, a selective vestibular nerve section, involves
opening the skull and cutting the nerve that links the semicircular
canals to the brain. It requires several days in intensive care and
up to two weeks in the hospital.
   But with a new procedure, streptomycin perfusion, patients often
go home the same day, Amedee said.
   The experimental technique, which uses streptomycin, an
antibiotic, to destroy nerve cells in the balance organ, was
developed by Tulane engineer and pharmacologist Charles Norris. It
was first tested five years ago by Dr. John Shea Jr. of the Shea
Otologic Clinic in Memphis, Tenn.
   Doctors learned in the 1940s, when streptomycin was used to
treat tuberculosis, that big doses could destroy balance and
hearing, Amedee said. Norris, who has worked with NASA to find ways
to fight vertigo and dizziness in space, thought injecting the drug
into the semicircular canals might be the best way to kill the
misfiring nerve cells.
   Experimenting on cats because of their acute balance and
hearing, he found a dose that would destroy the parts of the ear
that control balance but not the ones that control hearing, Amedee
said. Young cats recover their balance in 10 to 14 days, people in
four to 10 weeks, he said, and they use their eyes and the
remaining balance organ to stay on an even keel.
   Amedee and Shea presented their findings in one of 14 scientific
exhibits at the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck
Surgery meeting in New Orleans in September. The presentation
persuaded doctors in Nashville, Tenn.; Detroit; Sarasota, Fla.; Los
Angeles and London to try the operation as the first treatment for
patients who don't respond to medication, said Amedee.
   ``I still think the jury is out,'' said Dr. James E. Benecke
Jr., who treats Meniere's disease patients at St. Louis University
in Missouri. ``It's being promoted by one individual and being
investigated by several other individuals. I don't think there's
enough data.''
   Cutting the nerve works, he said, and putting a drug that is
very toxic to the inner ear directly into that organ may be even
riskier than opening up the brain. ``There's really no reason for
me to abandon the gold standard of operations for something that's
new and entails some risk,'' he said.
   Amedee said that of about 350 patients treated in Memphis and 30
in New Orleans, the only complications have been a few mild
infections. ``Probably the biggest risk associated with our
procedure is the general anesthesia itself.''
   Forster, who had the operation last April 25, is convinced it
works. ``I'm not 100 percent and probably never will be. It's like
quarterbacks that have had their knee operated on. I've had my knee
operated on, and although I can walk now without pain, I don't have
the mobility I used to have.
   ``Any time you go into the body, you're coming away with less
than 100 percent. But you're coming away with something.''
   He was about to lose his job as a mechanic for the Regional
Transit Authority because of accidents driving buses to and in the
repair shop when Amedee told him about the experimental operation.
   ``I was bumping into the side of the bridge going home. I
couldn't keep the car straight. They said, `Man, if you can't get
this thing corrected, we'll have to let you go.' It was too
dangerous to get behind the wheel of a bus.''
   Now, he's fine on four wheels, though he no longer enjoys riding
motorcycles, a favorite pastime before Meniere's disease.
``Sometimes I feel as if I'm walking a tightrope. But I haven't had
any really bad dizzy spells.''

   Brazil is second only to the
United States in the number of reported AIDS cases, but the deadly
disease may spread more rapidly here.
   ``I wouldn't want to be Brazil's health minister,'' said
Mathilde Krim, of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
``There's a probability the AIDS problem here will rapidly worsen
and there are few resources to help.''
   This South American country of 150 million people is in
transition between ``Third-World'' and ``developed-world'' AIDS
patterns, said Peter Fischinger, vice president for research at the
Medical University of South Carolina.
   ``Brazil is closer to the developed-world model. But the
possibility of Brazilian heterosexuals becoming infected by
established-risk groups is very great,'' Fischinger said. Krim
agreed: ``There is a lot of multipartner sex activity and also a
large number of bisexuals.''
   The first victims in the developed world, according to
Fischinger, were gay men _ who still account for 45 percent of
cases _ before the disease spread to intravenous drug users and
heterosexuals. In Africa and the Caribbean, a large majority of
victims were _ and are _ heterosexuals.
   Brazil, with 9,555 reported AIDS cases through December 1989, is
the world's No. 2 AIDS country after the United States, which had
113,211 reported cases, according to the World Health Organization.
France is No. 3 with 8,025 reported cases, followed by Uganda with
7,375.
   At a gathering last month of more than 50 specialists sponsored
by French, Brazilian and U.S. health organizations, Lair Guerra de
Macedo Rodrigues, head of the Health Ministry's National Division
for Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS, said Brazil has made
important progress in battling the disease.
   Sixty percent of Brazil's 6 million transfusions in 1988 were
with blood untested for the AIDS virus, she said. Nine percent of
the AIDS cases in Brazil were caused by transfusions, vs. about 1
percent in developed countries.
   ``The situation is still not ideal, but we've tested 70 percent
of samples in blood banks, and the risk has been greatly reduced,''
she said, adding that the risk of infection via transfusions still
is 1 in 40,000, compared with 1 in 250,000 in the United States.
   Brazil's economic crisis, with inflation running almost 2,000
percent, will mean a 60 percent cut this year in the division's
1989 budget of $10.4 million, Ms. Rodrigues said. ``We're doing the
best we can with limited resources.''
   Brazil was slower in acting to combat the disease than other
countries, said Michel Kazatchkine, a French researcher. The first
cases were reported in Brazil in 1983, but the government did not
place a priority on combating the virus until 1987.
   In France and the United States, homosexuals are well organized,
while Brazilian ``machismo'' keeps gay groups far more discreet,
she said. ``In France, there are a large number of support groups,
with hot lines, shelters, meetings and other assistance. In 1985,
65 precent of reported AIDS victims were gay men. The percentage of
gay men who account for newly diagnosed cases is less than 45
percent today.
   ``Figures in Brazil also show a lower percentage of gays in new
cases, but that may merely mean more rapid growth among others.''
   In 1986 in Brazil, Krim said, there were 117 men carrying the
AIDS virus for every woman carrying it. That ratio has dropped to 7
to 1.
   Ten percent of Brazilian AIDS victims are heterosexuals,
compared with an estimated 5 percent in the United States.
   Three other factors threaten Brazil's heterosexual community,
Kazatchkine said. Young Brazilians tend to be more promiscuous and
have less access to AIDS education and preventive measures than
their counterparts in developed nations; millions of ``street
kids'' work as prostitutes and also have sex with their comrades;
and in part because of the economic crisis, more women work at
least part-time as prostitutes.
   A final problem is an increase in the number of Brazilians who
contract AIDS via intravenous drug use _ now 12.8 percent of the
total, Krim said.

<HEAD>Scientists Unite to Develop Drought-Resistant Plants</HEAD>

   Horticultural geneticists and plant
enzymologists seldom talk to each other. The two branches of botany
use the same language but their dialects are so different they
rarely translate works to compare notes.
   But at Texas Tech's Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab,
scientists from a number of disciplines have learned to speak a
common language: drought.
   ``Most enzymologists talk only with enzymologists,'' said James
Mahan, a plant physiologist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. ``But here, I talk to all sorts of different people.
That's why this interdisciplinary approach is so important.''
   The lab's goal is to find varieties of wheat, corn, cotton,
onions and other plants that can survive the harsh weather of the
Great Plains stretching from Canada to Texas, with its frequent
drought, bitter cold and stifling heat.
   The results include drought-resistant cotton and wheat, a
sorghum resistant to insects called midges, and grape vines with
tougher leaves to withstand hail.
   Though it focuses on U.S. crops and conditions, the research has
international implications, said Robert Albin, associate dean of
research at Tech's College of Agricultural Sciences. ``In Lubbock,
we're representative of the arid and semi-arid areas of the world,
such as central and western Africa. A large part of the world's
land surface is semi-arid.''
   John Burke, another USDA scientist studying plant enzymes, said
almost all the research has international applications: ``These
crops are grown throughout the world. This research holds true no
matter where you are.''
   Burke works with Ellen Peffley, a Texas Tech assistant professor
of horticulture specializing in onion genetics. She is trying to
develop onions that can withstand extreme cold. Burke identifies
enzymes that make onions more cold-hardy, and Peffley tries to get
the onions to make those enzymes.
   ``As we discover the basic mechanics, this can be applied to all
crop species,'' she said.
   More than 50 scientists and graduate students from Texas Tech,
the USDA and Texas A&amp;M participate in the research at various labs
and agriculture stations; there is no specific, centralized lab _ a
major shortcoming that Tech is moving to counter with a $500,000
federal grant toward planning a $17 million complex.
   ``It gets to be quite complicated and we have to keep people
together and coordinated,'' Albin said. ``We're in such a
specialized area of research. You might have a molecular scientist
discover something important, but he doesn't know how to grow the
plant, so you have the A&amp;M research station for that.
   ``We've got to keep coordination in mind. A geneticist might get
caught up transferring gene A into plant B and lose sight of what
it's all about.''
   Congress formally created the Plant Stress and Water
Conservation Lab in 1988, but the research had been going on at
Tech since the late 1950s. The USDA picked Lubbock as the center of
the research because of Tech, lack of rain, and temperatures that
drop below zero in winter and soar above 100 in summer.
   Scientists affiliated with the lab are enthusiastic, though they
sometimes are at a loss for words to explain their research in lay
terms _ or in those of scientists from other fields.
   ``We have some sort of common goal in mind,'' said Henry Nguyen,
a Tech associate professor who specializes in finding
drought-resistant cereals. ``We see how we can mutually benefit
each other with our kinds of techniques.
   ``It just takes a lot of patience talking, until we understand
what each other is doing.''

<HEAD>Opossums Shed New Light On Competition, Aging Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opossums living on an island off Georgia
are giving scientists information on how competition for survival
influences aging.
   For about 9,000 years, the opossums on Sapelo Island have
enjoyed life without predators. As a result, they live longer than
their counterparts that have to face the ``dog-eat-possum'' rigors
of the mainland.
   Steven Austad, a Harvard University biologist, has discovered
another difference: The easy island life seems to keep them fertile
longer, too.
   Ordinarily, animals _ people included _ produce fewer babies as
they get older. Opossums normally live only two or three years, and
2-year-old females have fewer and smaller offspring than
1-year-olds. But on Sapelo, the situation is reversed.
Two-year-olds have larger litters, and their young grow faster.
   That's like a 45-year-old woman being more fertile than a
25-year-old, said Austad. ``This tells us that the same species
living in different ecologies for a few thousand years have evolved
to have different rates of aging.''
   He suggests that taking ecology into consideration can shed
light on why some species live much longer than others.

<HEAD>Widely Used Antibiotic Losing Punch Through Long Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tetracycline, long a mainstay of the war on
disease, may be losing its punch.
   The drug is one of the world's most widely used antibiotics, and
is commonly given to treat urinary infections, among other ills.
But a study found that many women harbor bacteria that are
impervious to various members of the tetracycline family.
   Drs. Marilyn C. Roberts and Sharon L. Hillier of the University
of Washington tested women who had not taken antibiotics for at
least two weeks. Twenty-nine percent to 95 percent of the bacteria
in their urinary tracts were able to withstand tetracycline drugs.
These included both harmless bugs and the kinds that cause disease.
   ``Their usefulness has been reduced by the increase in
resistance to the drug,'' the researchers wrote in the February
issue of the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.

<HEAD>Mom's Advice to Eat a Balanced Diet Still Good to Follow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans know a balanced diet is the
healthiest one, but they don't eat that way, according to a
national poll.
   Moderation seems to be a tough prescription to follow.
   ``Americans are surprisingly knowledgeable about nutrition and
health, but when it comes to translating facts into food choices,
most still opt for quick fixes and the latest health fads,'' Nancy
Wellman, president of the American Dietetic Association, the
nation's largest group of food and nutrition professionals, said
last week at a news conference to announce results of a Gallup
survey.
   Ninety-five percent of those polled said balance, variety and
moderation are the keys to healthy eating, and 83 percent said they
were fairly or very concerned that what they eat might affect their
health.
   Sixty-four percent said they were eating more fiber, and nearly
half said they had increased their intake of calcium.
   Nearly three-quarters said they were trimming fat from their
diets and roughly two-thirds reported cutting out saturated fats,
cholesterol and fried foods. But only 8 percent said they were
eating more vegetables, while 15 percent said they'd added fish oil
to their diets.
   ``Despite their awareness of basic nutrition principles, many
consumers seem to view food as medicine,'' said Margo A. Denke, a
nutrition research scientist at the University of Texas. ``They
think adding or eliminating a particular food or ingredient will
automatically prevent or cure illness. Such an approach is not only
unrealistic, it can also prove harmful.''
   Part of the trouble is a perception that there are ``forbidden
foods,'' which seems to make people crave the foods they try to do
without and then feel all the guiltier when they splurge on them.
   ``Prohibition of food creates guilt,'' Wellman said. ``And guilt
destroys good intentions and can lead people to actually overeat or
binge on those forbidden foods.''
   Thirty-five percent of those surveyed said high-fat foods cannot
be part of a healthy diet.
   ``The thing that surprised me is that people are still going to
extremes not in their best interest, particularly women who are
eliminating dairy foods when there are good, tasty low- and even
non-fat foods in that category,'' Wellman said in a telephone
interview.
   She also cited a ``continuing misconception that red meat cannot
be part of a healthy diet.''
   The advice most moms gave out about a moderate, balanced diet
remains ``useful and durable,'' Wellman said.
   ``One of my favorite special-occasion treats is a hot fudge
sundae,'' she said. ``I realize I can't have one for dessert every
night, yet it would be off-base to think I could never eat one.''
   The Gallup Organization conducted the telephone survey of 772
American adults Dec. 11-28 for the ADA and the non-profit, food
industry-funded International Food Information Council. The poll
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

   Retail prices made their steepest jump in 7{
years last month as consumers suffered from the left-over effects
of December's high food and fuel costs, the government said.
   The 1.1 percent increase in the Labor Department's seasonally
adjusted Consumer Price Index was the largest since a 1.1 percent
gain in June 1982, the department said Wednesday.
   It said 60 percent of the January increase came in food and
energy prices, as frigid weather in December drove down fuel stocks
and damaged fresh fruits and vegetables, driving prices up.

<HEAD>Abitibi Plans Price Increase; Industry Observers Say `Good Luck'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A planned price hike by one of the world's largest newsprint
producers is unlikely to take effect because supply is plentiful
and growing at a brisk rate, analysts and newspaper officials say.
   Abitibi-Price Inc. notified customers this week it plans to
raise the list price of newsprint by $35 a metric ton, or 5.4
percent, to $685 a metric ton.
   Any broad increase would be the first since an industrywide 6.6
percent price hike on Jan. 1, 1988. While the list price has
remained steady, actual selling prices and newsprint makers'
profits have declined.
   Edward Ahern, a marketing director for Abitibi's sales unit,
said the increase is effective June 1.
   The Toronto-based company, the world's second largest newsprint
maker behind Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, told customers the
increase is necessary because it is losing money on current
newsprint sales, Ahern said.
   ``I sent all our suppliers a letter saying I think it's
ridiculous,'' said Homer Taylor, vice president of supply for
Knight-Ridder Inc., one of the nation's largest newspaper groups.
``With consumption and operating rates dropping and supply
increasing and discounts increasing, it just doesn't make any
sense.''
   ``We don't think it's the right time,'' said Bill Hee,
purchasing manager for Gannett Supply Corp., owned by the largest
U.S. newspaper chain. ``It's not based on supply and demand. There
is plenty of paper around.''
   Taylor said the price announcement was a repeat of last year's
failed attempt to increase prices, and conditions in the industry
have deteriorated since then. Advertising linage is down
substantially and consumption at most of Knight-Ridder's more than
30 newspapers is flat to lower, he said.
   The American Newspaper Publishers Association said daily
consumption declined 0.3 percent industrywide last year.
Consumption fell 5.1 percent in the Northeast, where newspaper
retail advertising dropped substantially due to financial troubles
at store chain owner Campeau Corp. It rose 5.1 percent in the West,
however.
   Demand for newsprint has held up mainly because Knight-Ridder
and other newspaper companies are stockpiling supplies in
anticipation of possible labor problems in Canada, Taylor said.
   Mill workers in Canada have asked for a hefty wage increase and
have threatened to strike if demands are not met when their
contracts expire on April 30.
   ``Conditions are worse this year in terms of making a price
increase stick,'' Taylor said. ``They see all this purchasing and
are reading it as consumption.''
   Knight-Ridder has increased its inventories to about 50 days
from 36 days, Taylor said. Gannett recently raised its inventories
about three days to 45 days, Hee said.
   Industry analysts also are skeptical that the increase will take
effect.
   ``Wishful thinking,'' said George B. Adler, analyst for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``There's too much
newsprint capacity _ excessive.''
   Adler said North American capacity is continuing to increase in
1990 and is not expected to slow until next year.
   Meanwhile, many Canadian newsprint makers are experiencing
problems because of widespread discounting, a common industry
practice.
   While the current list price is $650 a metric ton, the actual
selling price to customers is about $530 a ton, Adler said.
   Abitibi on Monday reported a fourth-quarter loss and lower 1989
profits and blamed it on lower newsprint prices. The results follow
Abitibi's warning to employees last month of possible mill
shutdowns and job cuts this year.
   Nonetheless, part of the price increase could take effect,
particularly if Canadian employees decide to strike, said Robert
Duncan, analyst with Wood Gundy Inc. in Toronto. Eastern Canada is
the world's largest single source of newsprint.

   A $1 billion project to deliver as many as 108
channels of television programming via satellite to home dishes
small enough to fit on a window sill is being developed by a group
of four major media companies.
   Wednesday's announcement left plenty of unresolved questions
about the service, including what programs would be made available
and how much the service would cost.
   But there is no rush: the service is not expected to debut until
1993.
   Media industry analysts say the venture, called Sky Cable, would
provide expanded choices for viewers, encourage production of more
TV programming and raise competition for cable operators.
   But they also note that several obstacles remain, including
overcoming the industry's track record of failed direct-to-home
satellite TV ventures in the United States.
   The partners are General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting
Co.; Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd.; Cablevision Systems Corp., a
cable system operator and programmer based in Woodbury, N.Y.; and
Hughes Communications Inc., a satellite technology concern owned by
General Motors Corp.
   The partners said they had signed a memorandum of understanding
for the venture, which they said would be the first high-power
Direct Broadcast Satellite service.
   They said the service would be competitively priced, but
specific program offerings had not been determined yet.
   The service would be an addition to rather than a replacement
for existing cable service, they contended.
   But some analysts disagreed. Peter Appert, who follows the media
business for the investment firm C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell,
said Sky Cable poses ``a significant competitive threat'' to the
cable industry.
   ``If I can can get 108 channels priced competitively, I don't
see why I need cable if they can deliver as promised and the
quality is as promised,'' he said.
   Sky Cable would use the most powerful satellites ever launched
for commercial communications purposes and be capable of delivering
both high-definition television and standard video signals, as well
as digital quality audio.
   The companies said the new venture likely would be the first to
introduce HDTV to the United States on a broad scale.
   The venture will cost about $1 billion, including an equity
investment of about $335 million. Each of the partners plan to
contribute equal amounts of the equity once they reach a definitive
agreement.
   At a news conference, the promoters displayed a receiving dish
measuring 12 to 18 inches across that they said would be used for
Sky Cable. They said they expected the dish would cost about $300,
much less than the $2,000 to $3,000 price tag on bulkier,
conventional dishes.
   A few programs would be available free of charge to dish owners,
but subscribers would have to pay for other programming, which may
include multi-channel packages, single channels and pay-per-view
programs.
   ``This won't replace cable,'' said Charles Dolan, chairman and
chief executive of Cablevision.
   Dolan said cable operators will be asked to install, service and
handle billing for Sky Cable. Subscribers also will be able to sign
up on their own.
   Previous efforts to launch direct-to-home service in the United
States have made little headway. Such services are available in
Great Britain and Japan.
   Appert said past U.S. efforts often failed because the receiving
dish was cumbersome, channel capacity was limited and the signal
often was distorted.
   Earlier this month, a group of nine U.S. cable operators and
GE's American Communications unit announced a venture to offer 10
channels of programming later this year via a GE satellite.
   Robert Thomson, an executive at Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cable operator and a member of the cable group,
said the Sky Cable plans won't affect his group's satellite
broadcast plans.
   Sky Cable ``will be competitive to cable,'' he said, but cable
companies have an advantage of a large programming and customer
base and a flexible and secure transmission system.
   News Corp. offers a satellite-delivered TV service in Great
Britain, but startup losses have been heavy. Murdoch said the
British service has 600,000 subscribers and needs 2 million to
become profitable.
   The American Sky Cable service will need between 3 million and 5
million subscribers to break even, Murdoch said.
   Murdoch and Robert Wright, president of NBC, said there are no
plans to offer their respective TV networks, Fox and NBC, on the
Sky Cable.
   But Cablevision and NBC jointly own the Consumer News and
Business Channel, Bravo, Sports Channel America and 10 regional
sports channels.
   Murdoch said his company may provide programming for Sky Cable.
News Corp. operations include Twentieth Century Fox Films and TV
show production.

   A subsidiary of General Motors Corp. has become
the first non-airline company to participate in an airline
reservation system by signing a deal with Texas Air Corp., the
nation's largest airline company.
   Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Texas Air will sell
half its computer reservation system for $250 million to Electronic
Data Systems Corp.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo denied suggestions that the
partial sale of System One, under discussion since September, was
intended to help bail out financially struggling Texas Air or to
ease pressure caused by the strike and bankruptcy proceeding at its
Eastern Airlines subsidiary.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Houston-based
Texas Air has offered some of its own cash, notes and potentially
even its own stock to Eastern's unsecured creditors.
   ``Texas Air is not entering into this transaction because of a
need for cash,'' Lorenzo said at a news conference, adding that his
company is gaining a ``strong partner'' in the increasingly
competitive reservation business.
   EDS Chairman Les Alberthal, ticking off the benefits of the deal
to Texas Air, said, ``First and foremost, Frank did get our cash.''
   Edward Starkman, an airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc., called
the agreement ``a cash infusion for the company.''
   The president of Eastern's striking Machinists blasted the sale,
which he said allows Lorenzo to reap a windfall from the
reservation system that once was one of Miami-based Eastern's most
important assets.
   ``If this deal is allowed to stand, they're going to be playing
right into the hands of yet another big Lorenzo scam,'' said
Charles E. Bryan, president of Machinists District 100 in Miami. He
called the deal ``a Lorenzo embezzlement'' and said he would never
buy another GM car.
   The partial sale of System One must be approved by U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York, where Eastern filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors last March 9, five days after the start
of a strike.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern, is
aware of the new agreement with EDS, as is the committee
representing the airline's unsecured creditors, Texas Air spokesman
Art Kent said.
   ``They obviously didn't object to it,'' he said.
   Lorenzo didn't confirm or deny the Journal report on Texas Air
offering its own cash and equity to Eastern's creditors.
Previously, Texas Air has strived to keep itself and its
Continental Airlines subsidiary separate from Eastern's troubles.
   ``We own Eastern Airlines. Eastern Airlines is not some sort of
distant cousin,'' Lorenzo said. ``We are going to do those things
that are sensible and reasonable.''
   The airline chief also reiterated he has no plans to merge
Eastern with Continental, or to liquidate Eastern. He said
negotiations on a reorganization plan have been continuing with
creditors after Eastern's exclusive right to file a plan expired
Tuesday.
   ``Liquidation of Eastern Airlines doesn't make sense for
anybody,'' Lorenzo said. ``Eastern Airlines is coming along well.
... Eastern has a game plan.''
   System One Chairman Dick Murray told the news conference that
other airlines eventually could join Texas Air and Dallas-based EDS
as partners in the system, which enables travel agents to book
reservations for airlines, hotels, car rentals and other traveler
needs.
   If other airlines joined, Texas Air's stake wouldn't be allowed
to fall below 10 percent, he said.
   Possible future partners mentioned by Murray included Pan Am
Corp., America West Airlines and Alaska Airlines.
   The partial sale of System One is a radical move for Lorenzo,
who has underlined the importance of computer reservation systems
to airlines' competitiveness. Those systems have been undergoing
rapid changes and consolidations recently.
   Delta Air Lines recently merged its reservation system with
PARS, an operation jointly owned by Trans World Airlines and
Northwest Airlines. American Airlines' Sabre reservation system has
been seeking a partner after the Justice Department quashed its
plans to link up with Delta's system.
   United Airlines, USAir and four foreign airlines comprise the
rival Covia reservations system.
   In addition to the work it performs for GM, EDS is involved in
health insurance, government and financial institution data
processing.

   Digital Equipment Corp., looking to slash costs to
counter a slowdown in the U.S. computer market, might cut its
workforce by expanding a voluntary severance program, a company
official says.
   Digital also has reported ``bugs'' in its VAX 9000 mainframe
machine, a new product the company hopes will reverse a slide in
earnings. But the company and analysts said Wednesday the problems
were minor and should not affect sales significantly.
   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behind
International Business Machines Corp., saw its earnings fall 39
percent for the six months that ended Dec. 31.
   Furthermore, the company is ``walking a fairly thin line''
between the prospects of reporting a profit or a loss for its
fiscal third quarter, which ends in March, said Mark Steinkrauss,
director of investment relations.
   Digital blames the earnings drop on a lackluster computer market
in the United States, which has forced other companies to make
cutbacks as well.
   To reduce costs, Steinkrauss said the company recently started
considering ``a substantial expansion of the voluntary incentive
program.''
   The company last year offered a voluntary severance package to
several hundred employees in Salem, N.H., but analysts said Digital
now appears to be looking to cut several thousand workers.
   ``We've never itemized what the numbers might be,'' Steinkrauss
said. The company is considering many alternatives, and although
Steinkrauss would not rule out layoffs, he noted that Digital has
``never had any layoffs.''
   Digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees from
manufacturing to sales, he said.
   ``Digital is aggressively addressing the issue of cost control
internally,'' said Terry Shannon, an analyst with International
Data Corp., a Framingham firm that studies the computer industry.
``But it's like a super-tanker that takes five miles to stop or
turn around.''
   Shannon said a reasonable estimate on the number of jobs to be
cut would be 5,000 or more. Digital employs about 125,900
worldwide, and more than 70,000 in the United States.
   ``Cost cutting is necessary at all computer companies,'' said
Barry Bosak, an analyst with Smith Barney in New York. ``The
earnings get squeezed and that puts the company under the gun.''
   But he added that Digital is in relatively good shape despite
the need to make cuts.
   Digital is hoping to boost its earnings with the introduction of
the VAX 9000 mainframe, with first deliveries scheduled for the
fourth quarter, beginning in April.
   ``We've had some bugs in the machine,'' Steinkrauss said. ``But
none have been unidentifiable and none have been unsolvable.''
   Such problems are common with a new product and should not hurt
sales of the machine, he said, adding: ``There's been no major
slippage in the shipping schedule.''
   Shannon said the initial glitches in the VAX 9000 should have a
``minimal impact.''
   ``I don't view this as being tantamount to meaning the product
doesn't work,'' he said.

   Icahn did not return phone calls Wednesday to his office in
Mount Kisco, N.Y., where TWA is headquartered. TWA operates a large
hub and employs 8,000 people in St. Louis.
   Icahn also has been talking about selling more TWA routes, a
process begun two months ago when he agreed to sell the airline's
Chicago-to-London route to American Airlines.
   Possible buyers for TWA routes include smaller domestic airlines
that are looking to expand, like Southwest Airlines Co. or America
West, as well as large European carriers that want a larger U.S.
presence, like British Airways and SAS.
   Although experts generally don't consider shrinkage to be a good
long-term strategy, consolidating could allow a carrier to reduce
costs and make better use of its equipment and employees in
selected markets.
   The pilots say the decision of whether TWA gets bigger or
smaller has little to do with them.
   Kent Scott, chairman of TWA's pilot union, has said he doesn't
see how the $80 million in concessions sought by Icahn would help
the airline, which is burdened with $2.7 billion of debt and a
fuel-guzzling fleet of aircraft, the oldest among major American
carriers.
   Meanwhile, Icahn resumed negotiations this week with TWA's
mechanics, who have been working under an old contract for more
than a year and have repeatedly said they would not accept any deal
involving concessions.
   ``Carl Icahn has to decide which way to go,'' said Jim Carey, an
airline analyst at the Washington-based consulting firm, Airline
Economics Inc. ``It's up to him and I assume it depends on whether
he can get wage concessions.''
   Two other factors may prove to be more important in determining
TWA's future, as well as the shape of the airline industry in
general.
   One is the cost of jet fuel, which is about 50 percent higher
than a year ago. These higher prices are forcing carriers to look
for additional revenue, analysts say.
   ``If we don't see some relief by the summer it's going to be
hard for anybody to avoid making some big decisions,'' said Carey,
who is senior vice president for operations at Airline Economics.
   The other factor is the declining rate of growth in air
passenger traffic.
   According to Avmark International, a general aviation consulting
firm based in Arlington, Va., revenue passenger miles have grown at
5 percent or less for the last seven months.
   And analysts say a good portion of the increases have come as a
result of discounted tickets.
   For the first part of 1989 and most of 1988, revenue passenger
miles grew 10 percent and more, said Paul Turk, an analyst with
Avmark.
   ``The downturn in traffic is going to make the weaker airlines
even weaker,'' Turk said. ``We're going to see further
consolidation.''

<HEAD>Developers Oppose Delay in Announcing Which Stores to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated and Allied department stores have
asked a federal bankruptcy judge for more time before announcing
which outlets the companies will close as part of their Chapter 11
reorganization.
   But some of the country's largest shopping center builders
planned to ask Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. to deny the retailers'
request at a hearing today.
   Lawyers for JMB Realty Corp. and Melvin Simon &amp; Associates argue
that giving the Cincinnati-based retailers more time would hurt
tenants of shopping malls that are anchored by such Federated and
Allied stores as Lazarus or Bloomingdale's.
   The developers said a delay also could scuttle planned projects.
   Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, a company filing
for protection from creditors has 60 days to decide whether to end
lease agreements. For Federated and Allied, which sought bankruptcy
court protection Jan. 15, the deadline is March 14.
   In a motion filed Feb. 7, the companies asked to extend the
decision until a reorganization plan is in place _ which is
expected to be in mid-May.
   ``We think our request is very realistic and warranted,'' said
Carol Sanger, spokeswoman for Federated Stores Inc., parent of
Federated and Allied.
   But lawyers for Indianapolis-based Melvin Simon, which controls
66 million square feet of retail space in 200 shopping centers,
said the extension request ``is excessive and unreasonable and
should be denied.''
   The lease issue has become an obstacle for Melvin Simon, which
plans to build the $625 million Mall of America in Bloomington,
Minn. The mall is envisaged as the largest in the world, but
uncertainty about a Bloomingdale's store planned for the mall is
delaying a $600 million loan needed to start construction.
   Officials of Federated Stores Inc. have said they plan to close
only a few of their less-profitable stores.
   Ms. Sanger added, ``We are not talking about an inordinate
amount of a time extension. We're only talking about 60 days as
things stand now.''
   JMB Realty has plans to renovate a shopping center in the
Chicago suburb of Skokie to include a new Bloomingdale's.
   Equitable Life Assurance Co., which owns 14 malls that include a
Federated or Allied store, also is fighting the extension.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
he hopes the failing Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway will be able to find
a ``competitive'' solution to its financial problems.
   ``We have been watching with a great deal of interest the D&amp;H
situation,'' Skinner said Wednesday. ``But I feel strongly that you
can only do so much and I would hope that they will work their way
out of that situation.''
   Skinner said the Transportation Department would not even
``request'' that a competing but financially healthy railroad help
D&amp;H out.
   ``We are not in the business anymore of taking a competitor or
taking an organization that is not making it and forcing some
company to take that responsibility on on a non-profit basis,'' he
said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. ``We have to find a
competitive way for that service to be provided.''
   Nevertheless, Skinner said he hoped the bankruptcy trustee could
work out a merger or trackage agreement to save D&amp;H, the nation's
oldest continually operating railroad.
   In June 1988, D&amp;H filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law. The railway has debts of
about $100 million.
   The D&amp;H runs from the New York-Canadian border south to the
Potomac Yard outside Washington, and from Albany, N.Y., west to
Buffalo, N.Y.
   Last week, the Interstate Commerce Commission voted to allow
three railroads to continue operating on D&amp;H tracks while the
trustee works out a plan to operate the line temporarily with
subsidies from the states of New York and Pennsylvania, several
other railroads and some shippers.
   The reprieve lasts until Friday night.
   Meanwhile, two Canadian railroads that had been trying to buy
D&amp;H have said they are still interested in working out a deal.
   Earlier this month, the trustee, Francis P. Dicello, recommended
that D&amp;H be sold to Canadian Pacific Ltd., which bid $35 million
for the system. But the sale fell through when CP was unable to
secure rights to run on Conrail tracks that connect with the D&amp;H
system.
   The Canadian National Railways had made a $45 million offer but
lost its financial backing before it could make a formal bid last
week.
   The D&amp;H, which began in 1824 as a canal company, runs 20 to 25
trains daily. It owns 569 miles of track and has rights to another
1,012 miles. A shutdown would put 672 employees out of work.

   Nordstrom Inc. stock stabilized after a two-day
slide knocked 15 percent off its value, but bad news continued as a
union official reported a flood of complaints and claims for back
pay from the retailer's sales clerks.
   ``We're getting a lot of inquiries from stores around the
country, with employees saying they want to get paid for work
already done,'' Joe Peterson, president of Local 1001 of the United
Food and Commercial Workers union, said late Wednesday.
   Nordstrom stock rose 75 cents Wednesday to $28.50 after dropping
$5 on Friday and Tuesday.
   From its summertime high of $42.50 a share, Nordstrom stock has
dropped 35 percent in value. Forty percent of the stock is owned by
Nordstrom family members.
   Peterson said the union, which represents 2,000 of Nordstrom's
3,000 sales clerks in Washington state, had received more than 100
telephone calls a day in the past two days, and took in paperwork
with more than $200,000 in claims by current and former Nordstrom
employees.
   The calls followed an order from the state's Department of Labor
and Industies last week requiring Nordstrom to pay two years' worth
of unpaid overtime to its hourly employees in the state, he said.
   ``I think a lot of employees have been emboldened by the state
findings,'' he said. ``We were averaging 15 to 20 calls a day up
until the state findings.''
   Meanwhile, Peterson said, the National Labor Relations Board was
siding with the union on a complaint from last year that Nordstrom
was attempting to bargain directly with workers, bypassing the
union. He said the NLRB informed him Wednesday it was issuing a
complaint against Nordstrom.
   Efforts to reach Nordstrom family members Wednesday night were
unsuccessful.
   The company said Tuesday it was considering filing a lawsuit
against the state to overturn the Department of Labor and
Industries ruling, which cannot be appealed. The administrative
ruling cited infractions that included failing to calculate
overtime for some duties and lapses in bookkeeping.
   Peterson said the union has received claims so far totaling more
than $2.4 million. Claims could soar to the hundreds of millions if
the union goes through with a nationwide class-action lawsuit, as
it has threatened, he said.
   Nordstrom has disputed the cost figures put out by the union.
   Peterson said the union didn't want to take legal action and
would rather settle its differences with the company at the
bargaining table.
   Nordstrom's stock also has been hurt by the company's
announcement this week that fourth-quarter earnings will be lower
than a year earlier. A decline would be the first since Nordstrom
went public 19 years ago. Outside securities analysts had expected
a 10 percent gain.
   The company also was the subject of an unflattering front page
story in The Wall Street Journal Tuesday that detailed employee
complaints, including the alleged practice of workers going ``off
the clock'' to perform tasks such as stocking shelves, attending
company meetings and delivering items to customers.
   Employees were quoted as telling of pressure to produce sales or
be fired, and of back-stabbing efforts pitting employee against
employee.
   Peterson said he felt Nordstrom didn't have to give up its niche
in the marketplace but would have to change its practices toward
employees.
   ``Their system fosters unfair labor practices, illegal
employment practices and a lack of due process for employees,'' he
said.
   Nordstrom has 60 stores in Washington, Oregon, California,
Alaska, Virginia and Utah. It plans 16 more, including moving into
Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, Indiana, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. says the
two-year casino license renewal it received from state regulators
will help it shake free of bankruptcy and recover from the decline
that has hit the Boardwalk's first gambling hall.
   The Casino Control Commission said Wednesday in its unanimous
decision to renew the license that the gaming company must report
monthly on its troubled finances.
   Company President David C. Hanlon said Resorts, the parent
company to Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City,
can live with those restrictions.
   ``The conditions are essentially financial reporting
conditions,'' he said. ``Hopefully, two years from now we'll be a
strong company.''
   As for now, the company is trying to restructure its
debt-riddled finances in bankruptcy court, which the commission
said it considered in its decision.
   ``The mere filing of a Chapter 11 action does not, in and of
itself, warrant a conclusion that a company lacks financial
stability,'' said acting commission Chairwoman Valerie Armstrong.
``The bankruptcy action is but one, albeit significant factor.''
   She said Resorts had shown during commission hearings last week
that it could become financially stable within the two-year license
period under a ``flat growth'' scenario.
   Last month, Resorts won $14.3 million from gamblers, an 11
percent drop from the $16.1 million registered in January 1989,
according to commission figures. The casino's ``win'' for all of
1989 dropped 6.4 percent to $227.4 million compared to the year
before. Win is the amount of money gamblers lose, and does not take
into account expenses. It is not profit.
   Under the flat growth forecast, Resorts will post a $500,000
cash deficit at the end of the year because of an extensive
refurbishing program, the commission said in its ruling.
   The commission imposed conditions recommended by the Division of
Gaming Enforcement that Resorts file monthly balance sheets, income
statements and statements of cash flow and working capital. Resorts
officials also must advise regulators on a monthly basis of
significant deviations from financial projections and from prior
financial performance.
   The commission stopped short, however, of requiring the casino
to report daily or weekly, or to set a specific cash balance that
would trigger the imposition of restricted accounts to ensure that
wages, taxes and progressive jackpots are paid.
   Hanlon said he was pleased with the decision and confident the
opening April 2 of the neighboring Taj Mahal casino would reverse
the decline of the first gaming hall to open on the Boardwalk in
1978.
   Ironically, the Taj Mahal, a property originally owned by
Resorts, led to some of its financial problems as construction
costs since 1983 until its sale to Donald Trump in 1988 diverted
money from Resorts and its capital expenditures.
   Hanlon emphasized the importance of Resorts' plans to win
approval of its restucturing plan from bondholders and a bankruptcy
judge. The plan seeks to shed about $400 million of the $927
million that Griffin assumed to finance his November 1988 purchase
of the property from Trump. Griffin sold Trump the Taj Mahal in
return.
   ``Our first priority is restructuring,'' Hanlon said after the
hearing. ``We're going full speed ahead with it.
   Anthony J. Parrillo, the director of the Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said the division was satisfied with the ruling, but
took issue with the commission's refusal to set a $7.5 million cash
balance trigger or to consider a worst-case scenario of less than
flat growth.
   Ms. Armstrong said the commission could re-open the license
process any time during the next two years. However, she also said
Resorts had not hit the depth of the now-defunct Elsinore's
Atlantis Casino Hotel, which in May became the first casino to
close its doors after the commission found the gaming hall was
insolvent.

<HEAD>Honda Fights Subaru Over Trademarking Legacy Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd., which makes the Acura
Legend car, said it has filed a complaint seeking to block a
trademark for the Subaru Legacy car name.
   Bob Butorac, a spokesman for Honda's U.S. marketing arm in
California, said Wednesday that his company is not challenging use
of the Legacy name. Honda, however, does not want a trademark
granted for the Legacy, Butorac said. He declined to elaborate.
   Honda's challenge was filed in December with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office in Arlington, Va., Butorac said. Telephones at the
patent office were busy Wednesday afternoon.
   Fred Heiler, a Subaru spokesman, said an application for the
Legacy trademark was filed July 29, 1989, by Fuji Heavy Industries
Inc. of Japan, parent company of Subaru of America Inc.
   Heiler said his company conducted 2{ years of research into the
Legacy name before using it on its compact car made in Japan and
Lafayette, Ind.
   ``I think we did our homework,'' he said. ``Then this sort of
comes out of left field, frankly.''
   The Legacy's base price is about $15,000. A fully-equipped
Legend, the top of Honda's Acura line of luxury cars, sells for
about twice as much.
   Two other trademark battles involving automobile names were
fought and resolved last year.
   General Motors Corp. and the Italian weapons maker Fabbrica
D'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A. last May settled a suit bought by the
gun-maker against GM for using the name Chevrolet Beretta. As part
of the settlement, GM agreed to pay $500,000 to the Beretta
Foundation for Cancer Research and Treatment.
   Chevrolet kept the name.
   In March 1989, a federal appeals court in New York turned aside
a challenge by Mead Data Central Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, to Toyota
Motor Corp.'s use of the name Lexus for a line of luxury
automobiles. Mead Data markets a legal information retrieval
service called Lexis.
   Two models of Lexus cars went on sale last September.

<HEAD>Tektronix to Cut 600 From Payroll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tektronix Inc. will lay off 600 employees
by late May because an anticipated sales increase has not
materialized.
   Most of the layoffs will occur in Washington County in the Test
and Measurement Group, Doug Babb, spokesman for the Beaverton-based
electronics company, announced Wednesday.
   The Test and Management Group manufactures various products,
including Tektronix's original product line, oscilloscopes.
   The group typically accounts for more than half Tektronix's
sales, but its volume recently has declined at a faster rate than
the company's other lines of business.
   Other employee cuts will occur in Tektronix operations that
handle U.S. and international distribution channels.
   Babb said some employees to be laid off were told the news
before Wednesday morning's public announcement while others had not
yet been chosen. As required by the federal plant closure law, each
employee involved will get 60 days' layoff notice and the
opportunity to apply for posted vacancies elsewhere in the company,
Babb said.
   ``We expected our new product flow would provide us with enough
growth to begin to show earnings improvement,'' David P. Friedley,
Tektronix's president, said in a prepared statement.
   After expenses for the cuts, plus taxes and other costs, are
subtracted, the Beaverton-based company probably will post a loss
for the quarter ending March 3, company officials announced.
   Friedley attributed the company's problems partly to weak demand
in the defense, computer and semiconductor industries.
   ``Our product line and market positions remain strong,'' he
said, ``but we must get our expenses into line with our revenue.''
   The 44-year-old company manufactures electronic testing and
measuring gear, television control room equipment, computer
monitors and printers, and sophisticated computers known as work
stations.
   The job cuts will continue a series of layoffs and job
eliminations that have occurred at Tektronix since the early 1980s,
when it was Oregon's largest employer with more than 24,000 workers
worldwide. As of the last quarter ended Nov. 11, it had 15,136, of
whom about 8,800 worked in the Portland-Vancouver, Wash., area.
   About 100 were cut from Tektronix last summer and 1,000 others
were dropped between March and May 1988.
   Tektronix also recently announced it would close its plant on
the English Channel Island of Guernsey, laying off 200 there and
consolidating the manufacturing in Holland.
   Tektronix, whose sales have remained essentially flat since
1984, has gone back and forth between profits and losses in recent
quarters. In the quarter that ended Nov. 11, it made a
penny-a-share profit.
   For the present quarter, Wednesday's announcement said the
company's operating income before taxes and interest expense would
be ``near break-even.'' But those and employee severance expenses,
which could reach $20 million, will push the company into the red,
the announcement said.

   Upjohn Co. says it is forming one
division to oversee drug development from discovery and testing to
use in treating patients.
   Upjohn's pharmaceutical research and medical affairs divisions
will be combined into a new corporate entity, Upjohn Laboratories,
by April 1, the company said Wednesday.
   One goal is to focus research on areas where developments are
most in demand, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and viral
diseases including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Upjohn
spokesman Joseph E. Galligan said.
   ``We can make the most rational use of our resources by focusing
them on programs and projects that are closely tied to medical
needs and market demands,'' said Theodore Cooper, Upjohn chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   Upjohn Laboratories will include facilities in Kalamazoo,
Tsukuba, Japan, and Crawley, England. It also will oversee research
efforts in Sweden, France, England and West Germany funded through
Upjohn's European Discovery Center program.
   Dr. Jerry R. Mitchell, formerly vice president for
pharmaceutical research, will be president of Upjohn Laboratories,
the company said.
   Galligan said it hadn't been determined how employment would
change under the reorganization. Upjohn has been making
belt-tightening moves, including an offer of early retirement
incentives in November for its 1,100 employees in the United States
and Puerto Rico who were 55 and older. There have been 612 takers.

<HEAD>Guess Jeans Needed Nakashes' Money, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordache jeans merely provided investment
capital when it bought into Guess jeans, a Jordache lawyer said,
calling a lawsuit against the Nakash family a case of ``seller's
remorse.''
   Attorney Howard Weitzman also denied on Wednesday allegations by
the Marciano brothers, who founded Guess, that the Nakash brothers
sought to steal Guess designs for their Jordache line.
   ``The evidence will show that the Marcianos _ at the time the
deal was made _ needed money,'' Weitzman said in his opening
statement to a Superior Court jury.
   ``The evidence will show the (Marcianos') intent was to sell the
company to the Nakashes,'' he said. ``The evidence will show that
the Nakashes said, `Rather than just buy (the company), let's form
a partnership.'''
   The Marcianos are seeking more than $500 million in damages plus
a return of the Nakashes' half ownership of Guess. The latter part
of the decision is up to Superior Court Judge Norman Epstein.
   Last year, a jury did find that the Nakashes intended from the
start to steal for Jordache the trendy Guess designs that were
catching the fancy of the fashion world. This week's proceedings
launch the penalty phase of the trial.
   Weitzman contended that the Beverly Hills-based Marciano
brothers were looking for outside financing before the Nakashes of
New York agreed to purchase a half-interest in Guess in 1983.
   The Israeli-born Nakashes paid the Marcianos $4.75 million and
extended a credit line as part of the deal, Weitzman said.
   Guess' sales have since skyrocketed, with sales volume exceeding
$400 million in 1988, Weitzman said.
   ``This lawsuit is about seller's remorse,'' he said.
   The French-born Marciano brothers, Maurice, Armand, Paul and
Georges, founded Guess in 1981 with an investment of $170,000.
   A frozen account containing the Nakashes' accrued share of Guess
profits now contains more than $93 million, and the division of
that account also is at stake. The Marcianos also contend the
Nakashes were responsible for destroying a Guess fashion
subsidiary, Gasoline.
   The Marcianos also have named as defendants a Hong Kong couple,
Lee Sec Mon and his wife, who manufactured Jordache products in the
British Crown Colony. They allege the Lees were to have
manufactured Gasoline designs as well but diverted materials to
Jordache.
   Weitzman told the jury he would show that ``the demise and
destruction of Gasoline was caused by the Marcianos' failure to
live up to their commitments.''
   The Nakashes have filed a counter suit against the Marcianos in
Superior Court as well as a federal court lawsuit that accuses them
of racketeering.

   VMS Realty Partners has named one of its
founders, Joel A. Stone, president and chief executive officer,
replacing Jeffrey Park.
   Park's departure comes just three months after he was brought in

   Wednesday's announcement comes a week after VMS, one of the
nation's largest real estate companies, suspended ``non-essential''
payments to lenders and to its eight publicly owned mortgage
investment funds, citing ``severe cash flow problems.''
   Stone said Park left because of a difference of opinion with the
company's founders.
   ``We acknowledged in November that we were in a difficult
position,'' said Stone. ``The partners in VMS feel that the kind of
decision-making that we need should be done by a partner.
   ``Jeff had signed up with the company with the intention of
moving it ahead,'' Stone said. ``Following our decision to change
direction, he decided this was not the place for him,'' Stone said.

   Stock prices advanced broadly this morning in
early, moderate trading after the Tokyo market and other overseas
exchanges regained strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 7.66 points to
2,591.22 in the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
620 up, 286 down and 467 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.87 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the key Nikkei index rose more than
400 points in early trading, but then plunged on a wave of
computer-guided selling by foreign institutions.
   But the Japanese market recovered as investors gradually
returned and computerized buy programs kicked in. By the close, the
Nikkei index gained 92.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to move to
35,826.84.
   On Wednesday, the Nikkei plummeted more than 3 percent for its
third-worst drop ever. The plunge helped set off a tumble on Wall
Street, but the U.S. markets later recovered as institutional
investors took advantage of bargains.
   This morning, the NYSE's composite index of all its listed
common stocks gained 0.30 to 181.37. At the American Stock
Exchange, the market value index was up 0.63 at 353.58.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed
down 13.29 points to 2,583.56.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
577 up, 963 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 159.24 million
shares, up from 147.30 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Japan Considering Tax Breaks for Charitable Contributions Abroad</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering giving companies more
tax breaks for charitable contributions abroad amid concern
friction may grow over Japanese investments in the United States,
an official said today.
   The Foreign Ministry proposed the tax measure, and the Finance
Ministry will consider it for implementation in the fiscal year
starting April 1991, the Foreign Ministry official said.
   Full details of the measure were not made public.
   At a meeting last week, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama told
leading businessmen he was concerned that Japan's image in the
United States was in serious trouble. He urged Japanese businesses
to contribute to U.S. communities in which they have businesses.
   Nakayama said the problem underlying Americans' fears about
Japan ``is their feeling that Japan's policy objectives and the
Japanese way of thinking are not clear and that it is impossible to
guess where Japan's huge economic power is headed, and under what
philosophy or principles.
   ``In short, there are an increasing number of Americans who
think `The Japanese are faceless' or `There is no knowing what they
are thinking.'''
   Tax regulations now permit Japanese companies abroad to deduct
only contributions that promote Japanese culture, such as museum
exhibits or cultural exchanges, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
   Foreign branches of Japanese companies may, however, deduct
contributions from foreign tax bills.
   The new proposal was designed to allow new foreign branches to
make charitable contributions even before they turn a profit and
must pay taxes abroad. Parent companies in Japan would be able to
deduct contributions from their Japanese taxes, the official said.
   Japan has a weak tradition of corporate philanthropy, and
business executives _ some as concerned about Japan's image abroad
as the Foreign Ministry _ have said incentives are needed to
encourage companies to become better corporate citizens in the
United States.
   The Foreign Ministry's proposal will take time to work through
the Finance Ministry, the official said. It must be studied in
detail to determine its impact on tax revenues, he said.
   It would not, however, require approval by Parliament, the
official said. Japan's foreign investment, especially in the United
States, soared in recent years as Japanese companies built
factories, bought foreign companies and real estate and sought land
and labor cheaper than at home.
   Some investments provoked controversy in the United States, such
as last year's purchase of Columbia pictures by Sony Corp. and the
purchase of a controlling interest in New York's Rockefeller Center
by Mitsubishi Estate.

   In yet another step to cope with sagging
profits and a sluggish market for personal computers, Apple
Computer will lay off 3 percent of its work force as part of a
major cost-cutting campaign.
   ``Although the transition we are experiencing is by no means an
easy one, it is necessary to build an even stronger business
foundation for the future,'' John Sculley, Apple's chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a statement Wednesday.
   Since December, Apple has been embroiled in a tumultuous
restructuring that has included the resignation of the head of the
company's domestic division. Also, the company's new products
developer, Jean-Louis Gassee, reportedly is preparing to depart.
   The company also has implemented pay freezes, cuts in
profit-sharing and even dropped company parties.
   Analysts say Apple must deal with rising customer
dissatisfaction, sagging profits, management turmoil and worsening
employee morale.
   ``This is an extremely important year for Apple, particularly in
terms of product development and stability in the executive
suite,'' said Benny Lorenzo, an analyst at Volpe, Covington &amp; Welty
in San Francisco.
   The most significant problem for Apple is its eroding position
as the biggest supplier of easy-to-use computers, a position that
has allowed it to charge substantially higher prices than
competitors like IBM and Compaq Computers.
   Microsoft has released its Windows programs, a graphical
interface that attempts to offer a user-friendly alternative to the
Macintosh interface.
   Hewlett-Packard Co. also has unveiled a similar system called
New Wave.
   Analysts say Apple's products are still easier to use, but not
as much as they once were.
   Separately on Thursday, Apple announced immediate cuts of 10 to
17 percent off the suggested retail prices on all models of its
Macintosh SE and SE@30 personal computers and LaserWriter IINT and
IINTX printers sold domestically.
   David Hancock, senior vice president of marketing, said the cuts
would allow Apple ``bring the Macintosh personal computing
experience to more people.''
   ``Apple is now paying the price for decisions they made several
years ago when it elected to go for short-term profit gain, rather
than taking advantage of its leading position to go for greater
market share,'' said Jonathan Seybold, publisher of Los
Angeles-based Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing.
   Sculley blamed the 400 layoffs on a slowdown in the U.S.
personal computer industry, which after three years of double-digit
growth is expected to grow no more than 9 percent in 1990.
   But analysts have faulted the world's second-largest personal
computer maker for neglecting and even alienating its traditional
customers.
   Apple failed to meet a critical customer need by not introducing
an inexpensive updated version of its original Macintosh, which has
loyal users worldwide.
   Instead, Apple introduced expensive Macintosh models for
corporate use, where profits are greater.
   After numerous delays, Apple also released a portable computer
considered by many as costly, bulky and difficult to read.
   Apple's stock rose 50 cents to $34 a share in national
over-the-counter trading Wednesday.
   Most of the cuts in Apple's 13,500-member work force, which
become effective in two months, will be made in domestic marketing
and distribution and in personnel, finance, community and
government affairs and customer service.
   The company will continue hiring workers for research and
development and for its domestic sales force. Hirings also will
continue in Apple's European and Pacific divisions.
   ``Most everybody left at the company is making a big sigh of
relief, but Apple will still have the problem of low morale in its
product development division that remains to be corrected,'' said
Abigail Christopher of International Data Co., a market researcher
in Framingham, Mass.
   Apple had sales of $5.3 billion last year, up about 25 percent
from 1988.
   In the final three months of last year, however, sales rose only
6 percent and profits fell 11 percent. That was the third
consecutive quarter of lower profits and came during the
traditionally strong Christmas season.
   Dealers reportedly were angered that Apple did comparatively
little holiday marketing for its 13-year-old Apple II line and
support products, prompting customer fears that the company would
abandon the machine that catapulted it to prominence.
   Lack of effective marketing also apparently crimped sales of the
Macintosh Plus and Macintosh SE, the least expensive products in
the Macintosh line.
   Many Apple employees increasingly have been complaining about
the company's turmoil, especially the numerous restructurings since
co-founder Steven P. Jobs was ousted in a 1985 power struggle with
Sculley.
   ``These latest moves are basically the undoing of the last
reorganization, and that's been the pattern,'' said Seybold.

   U.S. officials today accused Japan of not doing
enough to reform deep-rooted business traditions and economic
behavior that contribute to Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with
the United States.
   After the first of two days of trade talks, members of the U.S.
delegation complained that Japanese plans to help ease the trade
imbalance ``hadn't gone as far as we hoped.''
   ``It is very important to note that some progress has been made.
But frankly, much more needs to be done,'' said a member of the
U.S. delegation, who briefed reporters on condition he not be
identified.
   U.S. trade negotiators had said going into today's session that
they expected quick results in addressing the underlying causes of
the persistent U.S.-Japan trade imbalance.
   U.S. trade negotiators are under heavy pressure from Congress to
demonstrate progress in the 9-month-old talks, which are aimed at
changing deep-rooted factors in both economies that contribute to
the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has said she expects ``a
plan of action and a realistic down payment that shows resolve on
both sides'' by this summer.
   The $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan accounted for 45
percent of 1989's $108.58 billion U.S. deficit.
   In two earlier rounds of talks, U.S. officials said Japan's high
savings and investment rates, its land policies, exclusionary
business practices and corporate alliances, inefficient retail
distribution networks and pricing mechanisms all act as trade
barriers.
   Japan, in turn, said inadequate savings and investment in the
United States, short-term corporate strategies by U.S. firms,
ineffective labor training and education and insufficient export
promotion were structural factors underlying the trade imbalance.
   After talks in September and November, U.S. officials complained
that the Japanese side had shown little evidence of flexibility or
willingness to act quickly, while Japanese officials said such
far-reaching changes could not be expected overnight.
   Japanese officials today explained a recently announced program
involving tax, tariff and import promotion policies, NHK reported.
The measures include tax incentives for importers and elimination
of tariffs on 1,004 items.
   The immediate U.S. reaction to the Japanese presentation was
``severe,'' NHK said.
   An official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
speaking on condition of anonymity, concluded after the day's talks
that it would take more time for the two sides to iron out their
differences.
   U.S. officials had earlier reacted with caution to the measures,
expressing skepticism over whether the import-boosting policies
would really increase purchases of foreign-made goods.
   Another key area of contention is Japan's Large Retail Store
Law, which requires firms wanting to open department stores or
supermarkets to obtain consent from existing smaller stores that
are generally reluctant to face competition from larger, more
efficient retail outlets.
   The lengthy, complicated process of opening a large store takes
about 10 years.
   In addition to protecting less efficient retailers and thereby
driving up prices, the U.S. side says the law tends to restrict
imports by limiting the number of foreign-owned stores and by
restricting openings of large stores that tend to sell more
imported products than traditional small stores.
   Williams said the U.S. side would call for abolition or revision
of the law.
   Washington is also likely to urge an easing of laws restricting
use of bank credit cards. While department stores and finance
companies allow incremental payments on credit, purchases made with
bank credit cards must be paid off entirely within one month _ a
regulation that U.S. officials say tends to restrict overall
consumer spending, and therefore spending on imports.
   On Friday, U.S. officials are expected to explain Washington's
plans to increase low savings and investment rates and to bolster
the competitiveness of U.S. firms.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely
in reaction to precipitation overnight in key U.S. crop areas.
   One storm system brought beneficial rain to eastern Kansas in
the heart of the wheat country while another poured welcome
precipitation on the Midwestern corn and soybean region from
central Iowa east into Illinois and Indiana.
   Other bearish factors this morning included a Brazilian soybean
crop estimate from a semi-official Brazilian agency that was higher
than expected, and indications that the Agriculture Department has
rejected bids from Morocco and Sri Lanka for U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   With the slight early losses, the markets appeared to have lost
momentum for further increases after Wednesday's moderate gains.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1 cent lower to }
cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.85\ a
bushel; corn futures were { cent to 1\ cents lower with March at
$2.42\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with March at
$1.36 a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1} cents lower with March
at $5.69\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange with frozen pork bellies up sharply on
technical factors.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .45 cent higher with April at 75.65
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent higher with
March at 80.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .28
cent higher with April at 48.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.35 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with March at 53.50
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled sharply lower on Wednesday while most
pork futures advanced.

   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved a low-calorie fat substitute made from milk and egg-white
proteins for use in frozen desserts.
   The product, called Simplesse and described as an ``all
natural'' fat substitute, is manufactured by the NutraSweet Co. It
is designed to have the taste and texture of fat but with fewer
than half the calories.
   The first product to be made with Simplesse will be a frozen
dairy dessert called Simple Pleasures, which the company said has
the creamy taste of ice cream but with significantly reduced
calories and cholesterol.
   The FDA approved the company's petition to affirm that the food
additive is ``generally recognized as safe.''
   Simplesse is approved for use in frozen dessert products only.
The company would have to get further FDA approval to use it in
other foods, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   NutraSweet, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Monsanto Co., also
developed aspartame, the artificial sweetener marketed under the
name NutraSweet.
   The FDA approved Simplesse for use as a thickener or texturizer
in frozen dessert products. Simplesse contains proteins from egg
whites or milk, or a combination of both.
   Foods containing Simplesse will have to include the product on
their labels because some people are allergic to eggs or milk or
both, the FDA said.
   Simplesse has also been approved for marketing in West Germany,
the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands
and Luxembourg.
   The FDA is reviewing a petition from Kraft Inc. seeking approval
for the use in frozen desserts of a fat substitute made from egg
whites and milk proteins.
   Also under review is a petition from Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. which
wants to use a sucrose polyester called Olestra as a partial
subsitute for fats and oils in shortenings, salad oils and cooking
in the home and by the food service industry.
   Lisa Lefferts, staff scientist at the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, said the group has no safety concerns about
Simplesse. However, the group has recommended that the FDA monitor
the impact of products such as Simplesse on the American diet.
   ``Will we eat more and more double-dip ice creams and eat less
nutritious foods, or will they help us lower our fat intake? We
don't really know,'' Lefferts said.
   The company said Simple Pleasures will be introduced in
chocolate, strawberry, rum raisin, coffe, peach and toffee crunch,
and other flavors would be added later.
   As an example, the company said, Simple Pleasures Strawberry
contains 120 calories and one gram of fat per four-ounce serving,
compared with 250 calories and 15 grams of fat for the same amount
of a leading `superpremium'' brand.
   Monsanto's stock surged as word of the FDA approval circulated
on Wall Street, rising $4.37{ in early trading to $112.25 a share
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>Eurotunnel Names Director General Of The Tunnel Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel SA, the consortium building a tunnel
under the English Channel, named a new director general for the
project part of an agreement with its contractors.
   Eurotunnel said Wednesday Bechtel executive vice-president John
Neerhout had been nominated to the position, replacing Alastair
Morton, whose appointment had led to a dispute between Eurotunnel
and the project's contracting group, Trans-Manche Link.
   Morton will hold the title of director general of Eurotunnel,
the Anglo-French consortium said.
   Late Tuesday, Eurotunnel and TML struck a deal to defuse a
financial crisis that had placed the tunnel project's future in
doubt. Neerhout's appointment was part of the agreement.
   TML was unhappy with Morton's appointment and refused to sign a
key financing agreement with Eurotunnel and creditor banks. The
move effectively cut off all loan monies to Eurotunnel and forced
the company to negotiate a settlement with the contractors.
   Eurotunnel issued a written statement late Tuesday saying the
agreement allowed the parent company to draw on new loans from the
banks. Eurotunnel also will comply with a court order to pay TML
some $116 million in back fees.
   Morton had served as Britain's chief of project, responsible for
negotiating with contractors. He developed a reputation as a tough
bargainer and contractors viewed him as insensitive to their point
of problems with cost overruns and delays.
   Alistair Fleming and Keith Bernard, deputy director general for
contruction and deputy director general for transportation, will
report to Neerhout, the Eurotunnel statement noted.
   The Anglo-French consortium said Morton also will remain as
national president of Eurotunnel for Britain. Andre Bernard holds
the position on the French side.
   Bernard will be the sole president of the common council which
is responsible to all stockholders for the management of the group.
Neerhout will also answer to the council.

   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, Britain's
largest chemical concern, said Thursday its fourth-quarter pre-tax
profit fell 13 percent, but that it still managed to post a
4.1-percent gain for the year.
   The fourth-quarter performance was hurt by a year-end slide in
petrochemicals and plastics prices, the company said.
   ICI said its pre-tax profit for the three months ended Dec. 31
came to 296 million pounds, the equivalent of about $506 million,
compared with 340 million pounds, or $581 million, in the same
period a year earlier.
   The company said it does not provide net profit figures on a
quarterly basis.
   It said earnings per share came to 26.7 pence, or 46 cents,
compared with 30 pence, or 51 cents.
   Sales gained 10.4 percent to 3.3 billion pounds, or $5.6
billion, from 2.99 billion pounds, or $5.1 billion.
   For the year, ICI said its net profit rose 27 percent to 1.06
billion pounds, or $1.8 billion, from 837 million pounds, or $1.4
billion a year earlier. Earnings per share came to 135 pence, or
$2.31, compared with 129.7 pence, or $2.22.
   Sales rose 13 percent to 13.2 billion pounds, or $22.6 billion,
from 11.7 billion pounds, or $20 billion.
   The year's results were helped by strong profit growth in
pharmaceuticals which offset flat performances in most other areas
of the company's operations.

   Sony Corp. on Thursday said its third-quarter
profits jumped 45 percent on strong sales gains in all of its
electronic divisions and following the acquisition of Columbia
Pictures.
   Net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 totaled $293 million,
compared with $202 million a year earlier. Net income per
depositary share on a fully diluted basis was 85 cents, compared
with 65 cents a year ago.
   Sony's net sales grew 42 percent to $6.01 billion from $4.29
billion a year earlier. The company said all of its elecronics
divisions in all geographic regions posted sales gains.
   Sony noted particularly strong growth in the United States and
in Europe, where sales soared 59 percent and 48 percent,
respectively. Sales growth in Japan was slower, at a 30-percent
rate.
   Booming business in eight-millimeter videotape recorders pushed
sales of video equipment up 35 percent. Sony sold some 800,000
eight-millimeter video recorders in the quarter, up 550,000 units
from a year earlier. The company expects to sell 2.4 million
compact units in fiscal 1989, a spokesman said.
   Audio equipment sales rose 32 mainly on strong sales of
compact-disk players. Several hit albums pushed recording sales _
including records, compact disks and video software _ up 72 percent.
   Results from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., which Sony
purchased in November for $3.4 billion, and the Gruber-Peters
Entertainment Co. were included on the balance sheet for the first
time during the quarter. Film sales for the two companies in
November added $203 million to Sony's balance sheet. Sony had no
revenue from films prior to the acquisitions.
   Sony said that the decline of the yen in 1989 added about 10
percentage points to overall sales growth in the third quarter by
raising the value in yen of overseas sales. With stable exchange
rates, sales growth would have been around 32 percent, according to
a company spokesman. Sony said its average exchange rate on sales
in the third quarter was 142 yen to the dollar, compared with 124
yen to the dollar in the year-earlier quarter.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, net income jumped
57 percent to $636 million, or $1.93 a share, from $406 million, or
$1.35 a share in the year-earlier period.
   Sales for the nine months totaled $14.69 billion, up 31 percent
from $11.23 billion.

<HEAD>Reports $566 Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said Thursday it lost
$566 million in the fourth quarter of 1989, primarily because of
discontinued operations of its MeraBank and Malapai Resources Co.
subsidiaries.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created last year by Congress to
dispose of the assets of failed thrifts, took control of MeraBank
Jan. 31. Pinnacle West Chairman Richard Snell said the holding
company was trying to sell Malapai, a uranium-mining subsidiary.
   Pinnacle West reported a loss of $6.53 per share in the quarter
on revenue of $312 million. In the same 1988 period, the company
said it lost $126.7 million, or $1.45 per share, on $325 million.
   For the full year, Pinnacle West lost $551 million, or $6.36 per
share, on revenue of $1.51 billion, compared with a net profit of
$4.2 million, or 5 cents a share, on $1.46 billion in revenue in
1988.
   Writing off the two ailing subsidiaries as discontinued,
Pinnacle West said income from continuing operations was $125
million last year, compared to $153 million in 1988.
   Under an agreement with the government, Pinnacle West must
complete a $450 million caital infusion into MeraBank by March 31.
It then will be free of other obligations to the foundered thrift.
   The capital infusion is recorded as a non-recurring loss taken
in the 1989 fourth quarter. No tax benefit was provided in the loss
because Pinnacle West doesn't know when or to what degree a benefit
can be realized, the company said.

   Stock prices jumped today in moderate trading
after the Tokyo market and other overseas exchanges regained
strength and bargain hunters began buying.
   The market also benefitted from a firming in the price of U.S.
government securities, analysts said. The bond market was boosted
by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told
a Senate committee that he sees no evidence inflation is
accelerating.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 28.83 points to
move to 2,612.39 by 2 p.m. EST.

   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei index rose more than 400 points in
early trading, then plunged on a wave of computer-guided selling by
foreign institutions. But the market recovered as investors
gradually returned and computerized buy programs kicked in. By the
close, the Nikkei gained 92.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to
35,826.84.
   On Wednesday, the Nikkei plummeted more than 3 percent for its
third-worst drop ever. The plunge helped set off a tumble in London
and New York, but the U.S. markets later recovered as institutional
investors took advantage of bargains.
   Dudley Eppel, managing director of equity trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said Wall Street exhibited
optimism today.
   ``The fact that it acted acted so darn well yesterday when the
rest of the world was falling apart gave some of the U.S. players
hope that this market could hold in here awhile,'' he said.
   Philip Morris, one of the most active NYSE issues, was up } to

   Contract negotiations between Greyhound Lines Inc.
and its drivers' union have broken off, and a strike has been
called for 12:01 a.m. March 2, the company said today.
   No discussions currently are scheduled between the company and
the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, said George
Gravely, a spokesman for the Dallas-based company that operates
both Greyhound and Trailways, the only nationwide intercity bus
systems.
   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers plus other maintenance
and office workers, did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   Gravley said the company received a letter today saying the
strike would take place. The rank-and-file earlier had authorized a
strike.
   Gravley said the company, which has been advertising for
permanent replacement drivers in anticipation of a strike, would
continue to operate.
   ``We have 600 people in school ... and are still taking
applications,'' he said.
   The two sides had been negotiating since Friday in Phoenix,
where the union is based, but remained far apart on wage issues.
   Joint meetings Friday and Monday, plus separate sessions with a
federal mediator on Tuesday, failed to result in an agreement,
Gravley said.
   The company, taken private three years ago in two deals totaling
about $470 million, had offered a three-year contract worth about
$63 million. Gravely said the union initially had sought a pact
valued at $561 million, but reduced that to $475 million.
   The union wanted wage increases of 66 percent over the life of
the contract, including a 50 percent raise in the first year.
Greyhound offered a first-year increase of 7 percent. Currently,
the average bus driver makes $24,743 a year, according to the
company.
   ``It is an excellent offer from a company that lost $20 million
over the last three years, and it is all this company can afford,''
said Greyhound Chairman Fred G. Currey, who led the buyout of the
bus company from Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp.
   ``The union has not disputed the fact that we cannot afford to
pay more than we have offered,'' he said. ``Instead, union leaders
have told us repeatedly that an employer's ability to pay is
`irrelevant.'''
   Besides the 6,300 drivers, the union represents 1,600 office
workers and 1,475 maintenance workers.

   While some grand old American retailers have
stumbled into bankruptcy court and others simply have vanished, one
major department store is thriving with its founder's
great-grandchildren in charge.
   Of the three major U.S. department store chains controlled by
descendents, 122-year-old Strawbridge &amp; Clothier is the oldest and
the only one to last through four generations of potential sibling
spats and inheritance squabbles.
   Strawbridge's has grown steadily through the takeover obsession
of the 1980s in which many rivals became sodden with the debt
obligations of new owners, some of whom didn't know much about the
business.
   Perhaps the most notorious example is the Campeau Corp. of
Canada, which bought Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and several other
famous chains in the late 1980s for billions of dollars in borrowed
money, then sought bankruptcy protection for them last month
because it couldn't repay debts.
   Strawbridge's, by contrast, has expanded with its own money over
the past decade. It has added four department stores and 10
discount stores in the Philadelphia area, considered one of the
birthplaces of modern-day retailing. The company has 13 department
stores and 23 discount stores in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Delaware.
   Its presence is a beacon for Philadelphia shoppers who have
witnessed Lit Brothers and Gimbels go broke and Wanamakers, the
country's first retail department store, sold twice. Strawbridge's
has been as steady as the modest Quaker family that runs it.
   Eighteen of its 20 top executives have been with the company at
least 25 years and more than half its 110 mid-level managers have
worked for the store 15 years or more. Strawbridge's claims one of
the lowest turnover rates on the sales floor.
   It has surpassed traditional big brother Wanamaker's as the king
of the city's department stores. Wanamaker's, coincidentally, once
again is for sale.
   For its 1989 fiscal year ended in July, Strawbridge's earned
$27.9 million on sales of $921.1 million. The company's sales are
expected to exceed $1 billion in fiscal 1990.
   While many competitors' profits are drained by creditors or
retained for a parent company, Strawbridge's has reinvested
earnings in expansion and upkeep.
   ``The independence of the company is the major contributing
factor to what we think of and call the uniquely personalized
character of Strawbridge &amp; Clothier,'' Francis R. Strawbridge III,
chairman, once said in response to a lawsuit filed by an outside
investor who wanted to buy the company in 1986.
   His uncle and family patriarch, G. Stockton Strawbridge,
described the effort to remain family controlled as ``an ever
present objective comparable to inhaling and exhaling.''
   In an effort to avoid attracting the attention of would-be
raiders, the camera-shy Strawbridge family resists press interviews
about the business.
   One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, attributed
the family's unity to good fortune as well as G. Stockton
Strawbridge's efforts at maintaining a tight-knit relationship.
   Strawbridge &amp; Clothier is now run nearly entirely by the
Strawbridge family.
   The Clothier family, whose wealth was devastated by the Great
Depression, sold most voting shares in the 1930s. A Clothier sits
on the board of directors, but is the only descendent of the
founder involved with the stores.
   For family businesses, surviving beyond three generations can be
difficult because interest in running the business often wanes from
one generation to the next, said Ronald H. Drucker, a family
business consultant with Philadelphia-based accountants Laventhol &amp;
Horwath.
   ``The problems pop up more in the third generation than the
second,'' said Dean Schuckman, a partner and management consultant
with the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. ``If the family is more
sharing of the founder's vision, you're going to find less conflict
among the siblings.''
   For Strawbridge &amp; Clothier, fertility has helped. The
Strawbridges have been able to pick those interested and talented
from a large pool of offspring.
   Strawbridge children aren't encouraged to enter the business,
but if they want to pursue a career in retailing, they have to work
at least a year at another major department store before entering
Strawbridge's training program.
   Four members of the fourth generation work at the company. One
fifth generation member, daughter of company President Peter S.
Strawbridge, joined the advertising department in January after
three years at Filene's in Boston.
   Francis R. Strawbridge III; his brother, David W. Strawbridge,
personnel vice president; cousin Peter Strawbridge and his brother,
Steven L. Strawbridge, treasurer and secretary, have 12 children
among them and there are scores of other fifth generation children.
   Two other major department store chains still are family
operated. Dillard's, based in Little Rock, Ark., started in 1938
and is still run by 75-year-old founder William Dillard. Nordstrom
Inc., based in Seattle, is operated by the grandsons of the
founder, who started the firm in 1901.
   Strawbridge's first opened in 1868 on the site of Thomas
Jefferson's old U.S. Secretary of State office in downtown
Philadelphia.
   Justus C. Strawbridge, then 30, took his landlord's son-in-law,
Isaac H. Clothier, also 30, on as a partner in his fledgling dry
goods store.
   The three-story house at the corner of Eighth and Market streets
has grown to take up most of the block and anchor a downtown
shopping mall.
   Since then, the company has had many offers, but faced its most
serious challenge in 1984 when a New York investor named Ronald
Baron was amassing shares in the company for a takeover attempt.
   Two years later, the Strawbridges defeated Baron by purchasing a
crucial bloc of stock from dissident family member Robert E.
Strawbridge III, who appeared ready to sell. The cost of retaining
family control was $40 million.
   As an additional defense, the company has established a
preferred class of stock that has 10 votes per share. Common stock
has one vote per share. The board decides who can buy preferred
stock.
   An executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
company has considered, two or three times, a debt-financed
restructuring to protect itself from more takeover attempts. But
that alternative has been rejected by the family because it would
divert too much money into debt payments.
   Without anxious junk-bond holders waiting to be paid or
short-term investors looking for quick gains, Strawbridge's has
been able to spend its profits on store improvements and
maintenance.
   ``In plowing back those earnings they are able to keep our
stores up to date, fashionable, attractive, exciting and places
where people really like to shop, the lone Clother board member
Isaac H. Clothier IV once said during the takeover fight with
Baron. ``Nothing looks Dinty at Strawbridge and Clothier.''

<HEAD>Soviet Union Overtakes Britain as Top Importer of Tea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the British are indisputably the world's
biggest tea fans, preliminary estimates released Thursday show that
Britain for the first time lost its position as the world's top tea
importer _ to the Soviet Union.
   Moscow's tea imports rose 92,000 metric tons last year to a
record 227,000 tons, pushing the Soviet Union into first place,
according to the independent business information concern the
Economist Intelligence Unit.
   In its latest review of key commodity markets, the Economist
Intelligence Unit estimated British imports totaled about 160,000
tons last year.
   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization put British
imports at 116,400 metric tons in the first nine months of 1989,
down from 125,100 in the same 1988 period.
   The Soviet Union has increased the amount of tea it imports
steadily since 1986, when its own tea crop grown in Georgia was
severely damaged by fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
   Particularly heavy Soviet tea buying toward the end of last
year, which coincided with crop problems in India, Sri Lanka and
other key tea exporting countries, helped push world wholesale
prices to three-year highs.
   At the peak last October, the average price paid at the weekly
London tea auction hit $2,885 per ton. The price at this week's
sale was at a six-month low of $2,095, according to the Tea
Brokers' Association.
   The price decline is the result of improved supplies following a
recovery in production in India and Sri Lanka toward the end of
last year, traders said.
   The prospect of a supply shortfall for the second year running
could lift the average price in 1990 to $2,360 a ton from $2,103
last year.
   The Economist Intelligence Unit said it expected Soviet imports
to hold steady this year because it would be difficult to cut
supplies ``during the present upheavals.'' Shortages of food and
other goods have exasperated Soviet citizens and aggravated
political turmoil at a time of serious unrest in some Soviet
republics.

   A spokesman for Gulfstream said the company's chairman, Allen E.
Paulson, decided to drop plans to acquire the corporate jet maker
out of concern that the bankruptcy case could lead to a bidding
fight for Learjet.
   Integrated, a diversified holding company based in New York,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on Feb.
13. That same day, a group led by Paulson and the investment firm
Forstmann Little &amp; Co. announced an agreement to buy Gulfstream for
$825 million from Chrysler Corp. and a letter of intent to buy
Learjet.
   ``Because of the complications of the bankruptcy filing, the
possibility of an approval (of the Learjet sale) by the bankruptcy
court would take too long to resolve and could end up in a bidding
situation,'' said Gulfstream spokesman Al Balaban.
   Although Learjet was not included in Integrated's bankruptcy
filing, the sale of Learjet would need bankruptcy court approval,
said Learjet spokesman Bill Robinson.
   ``We still are an asset of Integrated Resources,'' he said.
   Following the Gulfstream announcement Thursday, Learjet said it
would begin accepting other offers for the company. Integrated has
been trying to sell Learjet, which is based in Wichita, Kan., since
August.
   ``As a matter of fact, we have an interested company visiting
our plant today,'' Robinson said.
   Balaban said Paulson's top priority now wass completing the
acquisition of Gulfstream, the Savannah company he founded in 1978.
   Chrysler bought Gulfstream from Paulson for $637 million in 1985
and made it part of its Chrysler Technologies Corp. subsidiary.
Chrysler put the maker of corporate jets up for sale as part of its
move to concentrate on building cars and trucks.
   Learjet this week lost a U.S. Navy subcontracting bid worth more
than $1 billion to produce more than 200 Tanker Transport Trainer
System aircraft, but Balaban said that had nothing to do with
Pauslon's decision to back away from Learjet.

   Midland Bank PLC on Thursday reported it lost $374
million in 1989 after an exceptional $1.5 billion charge mostly to
cover losses on loans to lesser developed countries.
   The loss compared with a profit of $718 million, or 92 cents a
share in 1988.
   The bank said that on a pre-tax basis, it lost $446 million,
compared with a profit of $1.19 billion a year earlier.
   Total operating income came to $5.4 billion, up 11 percent from
$4.9 billion.
   The exceptional charge included $1.4 billion against principal
due on loans to various lesser developing countries, it said. Total
loan exposure to less developed countries rose to $8.2 billion last
year from $7.3 billion in 1988.
   The charge also included $53 million to cover potential losses
associated with a British court judgment last year voiding
interest-rate swap contracts with municipal councils in Britain.
The appellate High Court on Thursday ruled that interest-rate swaps
by certain councils were unlawful.
   The bank's assets totaled $107 billion at the end of the year,
compared with $95 billion at the end of 1988.
   The bank didn't break out quarterly or half-year results. It
isn't required to under British law.

   Stock prices ended mixed today in moderate
trading. The market rose most of the day after the Tokyo exchange
regained strength and bargain hunters boosted buying, but
profit-taking sparked a last-minute selloff.
   The market also benefitted from a firming in the price of U.S.
government securities, analysts said. The bond market was boosted
by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told
a Senate committee that he sees no evidence inflation is
accelerating and that it may in fact be decreasing.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei index rose more than 400 points in
early trading, then plunged on a wave of computer-guided selling by
foreign institutions. But the market recovered as investors
gradually returned and computerized buy programs kicked in. By the
close, the Nikkei gained 92.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to
35,826.84.
   On Wednesday, the Nikkei plummeted more than 3 percent for its
third-worst drop ever. The plunge helped set off a tumble in London
and New York, but the U.S. markets later recovered as institutional
investors took advantage of bargains.
   Dudley Eppel, managing director of equity trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said Wall Street exhibited
optimism today.
   ``The fact that it acted acted so darn well yesterday when the
rest of the world was falling apart gave some of the U.S. players
hope that this market could hold in here awhile,'' he said.

<HEAD>San Jacinto Wants $1.4 Billion From Parent Southmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Jacinto Savings and Loan Association has filed
a $1.4 billion claim against its parent Southmark Corp., saying the
junk-bond built company now in bankruptcy court forced it to make
bad loans.
   Southmark had envisioned San Jacinto as its core business after
emerging from bankruptcy court proceedings. Southmark last month
submitted a Chapter 11 reorganization plan calling for the sale of
nearly all assets except San Jacinto.
   Southmark on Thursday reported a net loss of $56.8 million on
revenue of $267 million for its first quarter ending Sept. 30,
1989. That compared with net income of $1.14 million on revenue of
$561 million in the same 1988 period.
   After allowing for a dividend on special stock, the per-share
results amount to a loss of $1.24 in the 1989 period against a loss
of 20 cents in the 1988 period.
   Southmark said the lower revenue was offset in part by shrinking
administrative expenses, plus $31 million in interest saved by the
bankruptcy filing.
   The report was delayed while the company formulated its
reorganization plans. A plan submitted in court last month called
for retaining Houston-based San Jacinto and turning over remainding
assets to creditors after pumping an additional $100 million into
the thrift.
   But creditors Wednesday called the plan unworkable and asked
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Felsenthal for permission to submit
their own reorganization proposal that would surrender the thrift
to regulators and quickly liquidate the remaining company.
   A hearing on the creditors' request to end Southmark's exclusive
right to propose a plan is scheduled for March 14.
   San Jacinto's $1.4 billion claim against Southmark seeks payment
for $584 million in bad syndication loans guaranteed by Southmark
and as much as $376 million in loans made at the direction of the
company.
   San Jacinto is the only large savings institution in Texas that
hasn't been seized or sold by federal regulators. When Southmark
bought the thrift in 1983, it entered into agreements with
regulators to maintain the institution's net worth above required
minimums.
   The thrift said its tangible capital had fallen about $19.5
million below regulators' minimum levels. San Jacinto claims
Southmark owes another $274 million to meet the new risk-based
capital requirements imposed by last year's federal thrift bailout
legislation.
   The creditors claim the thrift is losing $10 million a month and
is failing to meet its business plan, according to court papers
filed by a group of the company's creditors.
   They say the proposed $100 million injection still would leave
San Jacinto short of minimum capital requirements, putting the S&amp;L
at risk that regulators could seize it at any time.
   Southmark representatives, citing continuing negotiations
between the company and its creditor group, declined to comment on
the committee's contentions.
   The creditors are mainly holders of over $1 billion in junk
bonds. Southmark filed for protection from creditors last July
after saying it could not meet payments on more than $1.1 billion
in mainly high-yield bonds.
   Southmark used the bonds to finance an expansion into an $8
billion asset company with holdings including campgrounds,
insurance companies and a chain of nursing homes, in addition to
various real estate enterprises.

   The Department of Veterans Affairs said
Thursday it is raising its maximum interest rate for federally
backed VA home mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10
percent, effective Friday.
   ``The higher rate is a response to current demands of the
financial markets for higher yields on long-term investments,'' the
department said in a statement.
   The department had lowered the rate to 9.5 percent from 10
percent last July 17.
   The department said it also will increase by one-half percentage

   Rates on graduated payment mortgages will go to 10.25 percent;
home improvement loans, 11.5 percent; manufactured home loans, 12.5
percent; manufactured home lot-only loans, 12 percent; and
manufactured home and lot loans, 12 percent.
   VA home loans may be used to purchase, improve or refinance a
house or condominium, and to purchase or refinance a manufactured
home.
   In the fiscal year ending last Sept. 30, the department
guaranteed more than 188,000 home loans amounting to a total of
$14.4 billion.

<HEAD>First Day Of Trade Talks Yields Less Than Expected, Both Sides Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials engaged in trade negotiations with
Japan said Thursday that country has not done enough to address the
underlying causes of the persistent U.S.-Japan trade imbalance.
   At the conclusion of the first of two days of talks, U.S.
delegates complained that Japan's plans to help ease its $49
billion trade surplus with the United States ``hadn't gone as far
as we hoped.''
   In particular, Japan is moving too slowly in changing its high
savings and investment rates, land policies, exclusionary business
practices, inefficient retail distribution networks and pricing
mechanisms, U.S. officials said.
   ``It is very important to note that some progress has been made.
But frankly, much more needs to be done,'' said a member of the
U.S. delegation, who briefed reporters on condition he not be
identified by name.
   On Friday, it is the United States' turn to explain what it is
doing to change American practices that contribute to the
imbalance. U.S. officials said they would outline Washington's
plans to increase the low U.S. savings and investment rates and to
bolster the competitiveness of American firms.
   The talks, called the Structural Impediments Initiative, were
launched last May after years of exchange rate adjustments and
other steps failed to significantly reduce the imbalance.
   This round of talks, originally set for early January, was
postponed at Japan's request until after national parliamentary
elections Sunday that kept the Liberal Democratic Party in power.
   ``Because of the election, we did lose time and we believe
strongly that we need to get moving quickly and move forward to
some solutions,'' said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative S. Linn
Williams.
   After the delay, U.S. officials said, they expected Japanese
leaders to produce plans for both long-term measures and immediate
actions to tackle structural trade problems.
   U.S. trade negotiators are under heavy pressure to demonstrate
progress in the talks to stave off protectionist trade legislation
in Congress.
   ``The political realities are such that SII is not viewed
with... patience and therefore if that process is going to yield
results it needs to yield a sort of midterm dividend payment very
quickly,'' David C. Mulford, U.S. Under Secretary for International
Affairs, told a business audience in New York Thursday. ``We would
all lose if the failure to remove these impediments leads to more,
rather than less, protection.''
   U.S. officials say Japan's high savings and investment rates,
its land policies, exclusionary business practices, inefficient
retail distribution networks and pricing mechanisms all indirectly
restrain trade.
   On Thursday, Japanese officials explained measures in a draft
budget before Parliament to boost staffing of Japan's Fair Trade
Commission, its anti-monopoly enforcement authority; to increase
spending on public infrastructure such as roads and sewers, and to
reform the retail distribution system.
   They also explained revisions of Japan's land use law aimed at
curbing real estate speculation and increasing the supply of
available land in urban areas.
   The U.S. side contends that excessive land prices in Japan drive
up the cost of doing business, making it harder for foreign firms
to sell their products here.
   ``We carefully explained the steps that we're taking and in many
areas received an assessment from the U.S. side, but other areas
remain where there were still differences. It's going to take more
time,'' said an official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Members of the U.S. delegation said the presentations
``represented new actions and some progress, but it's clear to us
they haven't gone as far as we hoped with bold, new thinking.''
   ``Too often today, instead of new ideas on how to solve the
problems, we heard simply a defense of the status quo,'' one U.S.
official said.
   U.S. officials said they made a number of suggestions on
possible revisions of Japan's Large Retail Store Law.
   The law requires firms wanting to open department stores or
supermarkets to obtain consent from existing mom-and-pop stores
generally reluctant to face competition from larger stores.
   In addition to protecting less efficient retailers and thereby
driving up prices, the U.S. side says the law tends to restrict
imports by limiting the number of foreign-owned stores and by
restricting openings of large Japanese stores that tend to sell
more imported products than traditional small stores.
   After structural talks in September and November, U.S. officials
complained that the Japanese side had shown little evidence of
flexibility or willingness to act quickly, while Japanese officials
said such far-reaching changes could not be expected overnight.
   Williams characterized the latest talks as ``neither successful
nor disappointing.'' But he said the talks were ``on the right
track. In many ways I wish we had gotten on the track earlier.''
   Japan says U.S. problems contributing to the trade imbalance
include inadequate savings and investment, the short-term nature of
U.S. corporate strategies, ineffective labor training and education
and insufficient export promotion.
   Both delegations said they expected to produce an interim report
on progress in the structural talks by early April after an
additional meeting in March. A final report is expected by summer.

<HEAD>Avon Chief Predicts Higher Profit But Lackluster Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite expectations of only modest sales
growth, Avon Products Inc.'s chairman on Thursday said earnings
will improve substantially this year.
   James E. Preston, chairman and chief executive officer, also
said the company has had conversations recently with various
investors holding stakes in Avon, including investment partners in
Chartwell Associates.
   ``We're expecting substantial improvement in earnings for the
company in 1990 on a modest increase in sales,'' Preston told a
meeting of Wall Street analysts.
   He also estimated that the company's debt will be shaved to
about $275 million by the end of this year from about $630 million
now. Avon cut its debt by about $500 million last year, he said.
   In the current first quarter, Preston said net income will be up
``nicely'' on a slight decline in sales. He attributed the
anticipated earnings growth to cost reduction programs and lower
interest expenses and tax rates.
   Preston didn't provide specific figures. But he did say the
planned sale, announced Wednesday, of Avon Japan will produce an
after-tax gain of about $180 million this year.
   Avon has agreed to sell its 60 percent stake in Avon Japan to a
private Japanese mail order company for $408 million in cash at the
closing _ $338 million plus $70 million in advance royalties.
Another $42 million in advance royalties is to be paid 18 months
later.
   Last year Avon had a profit of $54.6 million, or 34 cents a a
share, after a deficit of $404.5 million, or $6.79 a share, in 1988
when it had $545.6 million in losses from discontinued operations.
   Meanwhile, Preston said in response to a question that he and
other Avon executives have had conversations with stockholders with
significant holdings of Avon, including two separate groups led by
Minneapolis-based investor Irwin Jacobs and Texas financier Robert
M. Bass.
   He characterized the contact with these two groups as
``positive, supportive and helpful.''
   At a meeting with Chartwell, a limited partnerhip, Preston said
Avon repeated that the big New York-based beauty products company
is not for sale.
   Chartwell, which holds about 9.1 percent of Avon's stock, has
said it intends to launch a proxy fight to win four seats on Avon's
11-member board.
   A proxy battle is an attempt by a person or group to take over a
company or oust its management by obtaining enough proxies _ the
legal right to exercise a shareholder's vote _ to influence a
corporate election.
   Partners in Chartwell include a subsidiary of Dallas-based Mary
Kay Corp., the privately held parent of Mary Kay Cosmetics, a
direct seller of beauty products. Avon is the world's biggest
direct sales company.
   Preston said he emphasized to Chartwell that Avon's sales
representatives wouldn't welcome any link to Mary Kay whatsoever.
   ``Over time Mary Kay has become the enemy to Avon
representatives,'' he said.
   Chartwell has maintained that if it decided to pursue Avon, it
wouldn't propose a combination of it and Mary Kay.

   Assets of the nation's 497 money market mutual
funds rose by $3.57 billion in the latest week to an all-time high
of $390.68 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
earlier record of $387.48 billion set in the week ended Feb. 7 and
followed a drop of $375 million in the week ended Feb. 14. That
decline originally was reported as $374.1 million but was revised.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 244 general purpose funds rose $1.33 billion to $132.55
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds increased $992.2 million
to $165.46 billion, and assets of 152 institutional funds rose
$1.25 billion to $92.67 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was
7.65 percent in the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the previous
week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.67 percent from 7.68 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.28 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.29 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.07 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.87
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.88 the
previous week. Yields were 7.93 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.94 percent; 7.95 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.94 percent;
and 7.99 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.00 percent.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. on Thursday unveiled an
electronic film-editing system that marks the company's entry into
the emerging field of hybrid electronic photography.
   The Premier image enhancement system uses electronics to take
the place of a razor blade or airbrush in manipulating a film
image. It can be used for retouching, cropping, creating composite
images, or changing the color, balance and contrast of a photograph.
   ``Electronics is going to take over the manipulation and storage
of images in many ways,'' said Raymond H. DeMoulin, head of Kodak's
professional photography division.
   Kodak's experience in traditional photography gives the company
an edge in hybrid technology, said Eugene Glazer, an analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Hybrid systems such as Premier have the potential to improve the
quality of photographic prints, which could increase sales of
conventional film products that are Kodak's mainstay, Glazer said.
   Premier, introduced at the Photo Marketing Association
International convention in Las Vegas, is faster and produces
higher quality images than systems already on the market, DeMoulin
said.
   The system is made up of a film reader and film writer,
identical gray boxes the size of a large chest of drawers, and a
computer workstation based on a modified Sun Microsystem computer.
   The film reader accepts color negatives, color transparencies or
lithographic films, which it scans at a resolution of up to 3,600
picture elements, or pixels, per inch.
   The digitized image can then be edited in a variety of ways
using an electronic pen or ``puck.'' The film writer writes the
altered image on new film _ either color transparencies or color
negative film _ creating a high-quality second-generation original.
Images can also be stored on 8mm videotape or transmitted
electronically.
   DeMoulin said the quality of the final product is
indistinguishable from that of the original.
   Premier operates on the red-blue-green continuous tone
technology of film, rather than the cyan-magenta-yellow-black
technology of graphic arts systems, DeMoulin said.
   Kodak's final display in New York City's Grand Central Station _
a huge photograph of a plump red apple floating behind the city's
skyline _ was made on Premier.
   Making the composite picture the traditional way would have
meant hours of cutting around the fine details of the skyline with
a razor blade and then rephotographing it with the picture of the
apple, said Robert Blakey of Kodak's Professional Photography
Division.
   Premier's zoom feature allowed the picture of the skyline to be
enlarged, making it easier to edit tiny details.
   The system, which will be sold beginning this fall for under
$500,000, is targeted at full-service photo labs doing advertising
work, magazine art or other large photo displays, DeMoulin said.
   He said Kodak eventually hopes to produce smaller, simpler
models to serve smaller labs and professional photographers.

delivery settled at $415.70 a troy ounce, down $2.30 from late
Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $416.20 an ounce, off $1.60.
   Traders said the spotlight was fixed on the Japanese yen, which
lost ground against most major currencies.
   The dollar rose to its highest level since September against the
yen, which languished amid dimmed prospects for higher interest
rates. The market had been expecting the Bank of Japan to hike the
nation's key discount rate.
   ``Japan's interest rates are a lot lower than everybody else's
interest rates,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of
Boston. ``Given that, people are looking for a much weaker yen.''
   High interest rates make a country's fixed-income securities
attractive to investors, who need hard currency to make their
investments.
   Earlier in Europe, the dollar put in a mixed performance while
confined to well-established ranges. When trading shifted to the
United States, the dollar appeared to firm but ultimately finished
lower against all major currencies except the yen.
   ``Cross-rates are mostly it,'' said a dealer at a British
commercial bank. ``The dollar is really sidelined.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.23 yen, up 0.08 yen from
Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar traded at 145.90
yen. In New York the dollar continued to rise, closing at 146.53
yen, up from 145.50 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound held steady at $1.7145. In New York
it cost $1.7133 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's
$1.7125.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday included: 1.6717 West German marks, down from 1.6725;
1.4755 Swiss francs, down from 1.4795; 5.6620 French francs, down
from 5.6730; 1,236.00 Italian lire, down from 1,238.00, and 1.1949
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1983.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.6695 West German marks, up from 1.6645; 1.4725 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4735; and 5.6580 French francs, up from 5.6500.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $417.45 a troy ounce,
from $418.85 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $417.25, from $419.50 late Wednesday. Gold in Hong
Kong dropped $2.85 to close at $416.83.
   Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery slipped to $5.268 an ounce, from $5.272 on
Wednesday. In London the metal fell to a late bid price of $5.28 a
troy ounce, from Wednesday's $5.33.

   Petroleum futures prices rose Thursday despite
persistent concerns that crude oil supplies continue to exceed
demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, inched up 1
cent to $21.75 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Analysts said Wednesday's American Petroleum Institute report
showing a 3.7 million barrel drop in crude oil stocks to 344.9
million barrels last week helped firm front-month prices.
   Otherwise, the April contract would have declined as the market
focuses on refinery mainentance slowdowns scheduled for March and
April which will reduce refiners' short-term demand for raw oil.
   ``We're looking at a soft demand schedule,'' said John Hill,
energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   May crude oil closed 13 cents higher at $21.73 and June rose 19
cents to $21.59.
   Hill said the narrow spread between the April and May contracts
suggests the possibility that the April contract will go lower in
coming days.
   Refined products futures also rose despite the API data that
showed a rise in inventories. March unleaded gasoline increased
0.84 cent to 60.25 cents a gallon, April advanced 0.89 cent to
61.09 cents and May closed 0.86 cent higher at 64.94 cents.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery gained 0.62 cent to 58.15
cents a gallon, April edged up 0.23 cent to 56.98 cents and May
added 0.36 cent to 55.96 cents.
   Analysts said cold weather helped lift heating oil prices
despite the API data.The API report, released after the close of
trading Wednesday, showed that gasoline stocks rose 2.1 million
barrels to 240 million barrels and distillate inventories increased
2.6 million barrels to 119.3 million barrels.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Reach 7-Month Highs on Supply Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices reached seven-month highs Thursday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange in a rally fueled by supply
worries and strong technical signals.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals weakened; petroleum
futures rose; wheat and corn futures advanced while soybeans
retreated; and most livestock and meat futures moved higher.
   Coffee futures settled 1 cent to 2.25 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March up 1.52 cents at 91.16 cents a
pound, the highest close for March coffee since July 21 and the
highest for a near-month coffee contract since July 6.
   Analysts linked the advance to perceptions that high-grade
coffee beans are becoming more difficult to obtain and speculation
that more coffee-producing nations may be forced to cancel coffee
shipments due to dwindling old-crop supplies and poor growing
conditions for the new crop in South America.
   Mexico reportedly canceled some of its export commitments two
weeks ago.
   Coffee prices have been climbing steadily back this year from
the 14-year lows reached last fall after the International Coffee
Organization suspended export quotas on July 3, exposing coffee
prices to free-market forces.
   Since the year began, coffee for March delivery has risen from
less than 80 cents to more than 91 cents a pound, a gain of nearly
15 percent in just six weeks.
   The ease with which the market has ascended through price levels
of expected resistance has attracted chart-based buying.
   ``On the technical side, the charts are looking very, very
strong,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   A meeting next week of U.S., Central American and Colombian
trade representatives in Guatemala is seen by some analysts as a
step toward eventual reinstatement of coffee export quotas. But
other observers see little chance of any movement on the issue in
the near future.
   ``Particularly with prices going up, there's going to be less
interest in reinstating quotas,'' said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Precious metal futures retreated in reaction to a stronger
dollar and a stronger U.S. stock market, although stock prices fell
after the metal futures markets closed.
   Gold finished $2.30 to $2.60 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with February at $415.70 a troy ounce; silver was 0.4 cent
to 1.3 cents lower with March at $5.273 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange with
strength stemming from Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum
Institute inventory report, which showed lower-than-expected U.S.
supplies of distillates and crude.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 18 cents
lower with April at $20.65 a barrel; heating oil futures were .23
cent to .66 cent higher with March at 58.15 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .89 cent higher with March at
60.25 cents a gallon.
   Supply concerns pushed wheat and corn futures prices moderately
higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade but soybean futures
closed lower amid profit-taking.
   The contract for March delivery of wheat rose 5 cents amid
indications of dwindling supplies certified as deliverable against
the contract. Next Wednesday is first notice day for March wheat,
the first chance for traders to declare their intentions to deliver
grain against futures contracts.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent lower to 5 cents higher with March
at $3.89{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with March
at $2.45 a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
March at $1.37{ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents lower
with March at $5.68 a bushel.
   Frozen pork belly futures soared the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting strong
technical signals and projections for stronger demand from bacon
slicers.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .35 cent higher
with April at 75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to
.45 cent higher with March at 80.42 cents a pound; live hogs were
.12 cent to .73 cent higher with April at 48.65 cents a pound; pork
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with March at 54.15
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three measures of the nation's money supply each
rose in the week ended Feb. 12, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1,
edged up $100 million to a seasonally adjusted $798.6 billion from
a revised $798.5 billion the previous week. The prior week was
initially reported at $799.2 billion.
   The central bank said the measure known as M2 rose $3.0 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $3,252.5 billion from a revised $3,249.5
billion the previous week. The previous week's figure had been
reported at $3,251.7 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $3.4 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $4,068.9 billion from $4,065.5 billion. The previous
week's figure was initially reported at $4,067.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 6.9 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 4.2 percent, also within the Fed's
target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,226.2 billion, a 4.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4.067.8 billion, up 3.2 percent, while M1
rose 4.9 percent to an average of $794.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $1.659 billion a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$1.037 billion the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net borrowed reserves averaged $355
million in the latest two weeks, compared with net free reserves of
a revised $378 million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $298.5 billion in the latest two-week period,
down from $300.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Exxon Taking $300 Million Charge For Litigation Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. on Thursday lowered its fourth
quarter and 1989 profit estimates by $300 million to account for
legal costs and additional cleanup charges associated with last
year's Alaska oil spill.
   The revision marked the first time the world's largest oil
company has included litigation expenses in its spill-related
charges, which now total more than $2 billion.
   It also coincides with Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily's
disclosure that Justice Department and Exxon attorneys might file a
plea bargain settlement Friday over pending criminal charges for
environmental damages from the spill.
   A dollar amount involved in a possible settlement has not been
disclosed.
   The additional charge announced Thursday brings to $800 million
the amount Exxon deducted for out-of-pocket, spill-related expenses
in the fourth quarter.
   ``New developments and assessments led to the revised estimate
of future costs associated with the Valdez accident,'' Exxon said
in a statement released late Thursday.
   Spokesman Bill Smith declined to provide details except to say
they were for ``past as well as anticipated'' litigation, cleanup
and environmental restoration expenses.
   ``We haven't broken it down,'' Smith said.
   Smith said the company did not know whether the company plans to
add additional charges in 1990 for legal or other costs.
   An Exxon tanker that ran onto a reef last March 24 in Alaska's
Prince William Sound spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil,
fouling miles of shoreline and killing fish and other wildlife.
   In addition to the charges, there are 170 spill-related lawsuits
pending against Exxon.
   For the fourth quarter, Exxon estimates its earnings will total
$485 million, or 37 cents a share, down 65 percent from $1.4
billion, or $1.06 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Exxon
earlier estimated fourth-quarter profits of $785 million, or 61
cents a share.
   Revenue was up 15 percent in the quarter to $26.6 billion from
$23 billion.
   For all of 1989, Exxon revised its earnings estimate to $3.5
billion, or $2.74 a share, from its earlier $3.8 billion, or $2.98
a share. That was a 34-percent drop from $5.3 billion, or $3.95 a
share, in 1988. Revenue was $96.1 billion compared with $88.6
billion.
   The latest provision comes on top of charges totaling $880
million in the first and second quarters and more than $400 million
in insurance proceeds that Exxon has said it expected to have
available to help pay for spill-related cleanup costs.
   Exxon annnounced this week that it would return to Alaska on May
1 to clean up remnants of the spill. Exxon's announcement followed
a Coast Guard declaration essentially ordering the company to
return.
   Although Exxon has said it would continue the cleanup this
spring, it also has worried state and environmental officials by
insisting that the wind and wave action would make cleaning
unnecessary this summer.

<HEAD>Integrated Posts $184 Million Loss in Latest Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fallen financial services company Integrated
Resources Inc. said Thursday that it lost $184 million in its third
quarter, reflecting the problems that led to its recent filing for
bankruptcy court protection.
   The company said the loss amounted to $24.81 a share for the
three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $3.84
million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the period plummeted to $33.5 million from $104.4
million a year earlier.
   Integrated said the loss resulted from ``liquidity and financial
problems'' and reflected writedowns on its assets that the company
either sold or planned to sell as it tried to deal with those
problems.
   The onetime high-flying concern filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws on Feb. 13
after some of its creditors balked at restructuring more than $1.6
billion in debt.
   Integrated had tried to build a financial services empire with
about $800 million in junk-bond fincancing provided by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., but was unable to meet the high interest
payments due on the debt.
   Integrated's filing for bankruptcy court protection came within
hours of Drexel's parent seeking the same protection.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Integrated said it lost
$1.22 billion, or $165.53 a share, in contrast to a profit of $23.7
million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue fell 32.7 percent to $214.2 million from
$318.2 million a year earlier.
   Integrated said it was forced to write down the carrying value
of assets of certain publicly offered limited partnerships that
Integrated sponsored and managed and now expects to sell.
   Integrated said it also had losses from operations as its
financial problems impaired its ability to market investment
programs.
   In addition, the loss reflects the lower than expected price the
company received in selling several of its key fianancial services
businesses to Broad Inc., a Los Angeles-based financial services
concern.
   Integrated sold the businesses, which included brokerage, asset
management and life insurance businesses, for $95 million last
month, well below the $450 million that it had hoped to receive.

<TEXT>
   For years, the sterling image of wonderful
service and quality merchandise at the Nordstrom's department store
chain has been the envy of the retail industry, and fueled
expansion, customer loyalty and high profits.
   Now that image has been tarnished by a state labor finding that
the company doesn't properly compensate its sales force and by
worker allegations the behind the quality service is often-grueling
pressure to produce sales.
   But some shoppers say they're not ready to stop buying at
Nordstrom, even though their visits have become somewhat of a guilt
trip.
   ``I will probably still shop here because of their merchandise,
but I don't agree with the way they treat their employees,'' said
Annette Voeller, a communications manager said outside Nordstrom's
flagship Seattle store.
   ``I don't think I'll stop shopping there, but it's nice to pay
the employees,'' said Angela Kristie, a sportswear saleswoman at
competitor Frederick and Nelson who passes up her 20 percent
employee discount to buy shoes at Nordstrom.
   The state Department of Labor and Industries last week found
Nordstrom systematically made employees perform work-related duties
without compensation, and ordered it to pay them two years' worth
of overtime.
   The finding stemmed from a complaint by the United Food and
Commercial Workers union, which said clerks were expected to
deliver merchandise to customers' homes, do inventories and attend
company pep talks on their own time.
   The union estimates workers in Washington are owed up to $40
million while California employees of the store are owed $300
million.
   ``Their system fosters unfair labor practices, illegal
employment practices and a lack of due process for employees,''
said Joe Peterson, president of Local 1001.
   Nordstrom issued a statement Thursday saying it accepts ``full
responsibility for any pressure employees have felt to perform
these duties without pay,'' spokeswoman Kelley Tormey said.
   Nordstrom already has given employees compensation claim forms
and instituted a new policy in which employees sign special
timesheets when they go on customer deliveries so that they get
paid, Tormey said.
   Nordstrom is exploring whether one of the state's findings,
regarding calculation of overtime, was based on correct
interpretation of the law, said Tormey.
   ``It's premature to talk about the size of the impact (of the
findings on the company's image),'' she said. ``We're very, very
concerned.''
   The rulings come as the company is in contract negotiations with
the union, which claims to represent around 1,400 of the 3,000
sales clerks in Washington. The last contract expired July 31.
   The state's findings have divided employees as well as shoppers.
While some complained of hours of unpaid work, others saw the issue
as a ploy to ensure the union's survival.
   ``To make out that people are oppressed here is insane,'' said
David Fehrenbacher, a women's shoes salesman who says he works
regular hours to pull $30,000 a year before profit-sharing.
   ``It's not too bad for just standing there selling shoes. You
don't need a college degree and you don't need a technical
background,'' Fehrenbacher said.
   Whatever the outcome of the dispute, it is likely to affect
Nordstrom's profitability, analysts said.
   The conflict is being watched widely by retailers because of the
industry-wide trend toward reinstituting commission sales, which
was led by Nordstrom. Nearly all Nordstrom salespeople receive a
base salary of $9.85 per hour plus commission.
   Nordstrom generates about $400 of retail sales per square foot
of floorspace, about twice the industry average. Sales help
earnings are also about twice the industry average.
   The company's pretax profit margin of about 8.5 percent annually
is one of the highest in the highly competitive industry.
   Analysts said Nordstrom's profitability is enhanced by
off-the-clock work, but that quantifying the amount is difficult.
However, they said, changing the commission system to compensate
employees would be costly.
   ``There's no doubt that (the profitability) is partly
attributable to off-the-clock work,'' said Carol Palmer, retail
analyst with Duff and Phelps in Chicago. ``If a union-type
mentality takes over, it's the worst thing that could happen.''
   If the company alters its commissions policy due to the union
dispute, other retailers will adapt that to their own needs,
analysts said.
   ``Everyone's going into commission programs. I don't think the
trend will be derailed. There will be a correction in the
commissions system and it will continue,'' said Pam Stubing, vice
president with Moody's Investor Service in New York.
   But analysts and shoppers say Norstrom also benefits from a
strong merchandise lineup and its no-questions-asked returns policy.
   Nordstrom has 60 stores in Washington, Oregon, California,
Alaska, Virginia and Utah. It plans 16 more, including moving into
Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, Indiana, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.
   From its high of $42.50 a share last summer, Nordstrom stock has
dropped 35 percent in value, closing Thursday at $29.25 a share.
Forty percent of the stock is owned by members of the founding
Nordstrom family.
   The stock stabilized Wednesday after a two-day slide knocked 15
percent off its value.
   Nordstrom's stock also has been hurt by the company's
announcement this week that fourth-quarter earnings will be lower
than a year earlier. A decline would be the first since Nordstrom
went public 19 years ago and a marked reversal from analyst
estimates of a 10 percent gain.

   Stock prices ended mixed Thursday in moderate
trading after a last-minute selloff sparked by a rumor about a
Japanese scandal.
   Earlier, issues rose following renewed strength on the Tokyo
market and buying by bargain hunters.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed down 8.79 to
2,574.77. At midday it had been up as much as 30 points.
   Advancing issues nearly matched declining issues in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 715 up, 753
down and 508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 184.32 million
shares, up from 159.24 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 214.69 million shares.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei index was on a roller coaster until the
close, when it was up 92.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 35,826.84.
   On Wednesday, the Nikkei plummeted more than 3 percent for its
third-worst drop ever. The plunge helped set off a tumble in London
and New York, but the U.S. markets later recovered.
   The market Thursday also benefited from a firming in the price
of U.S. government debt securities, analysts said, and comments
from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Greenspan told a
Senate committee that he sees no evidence inflation is accelerating
and that it may be decreasing.
   Dudley Eppel, managing director of equity trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said Wall Street exhibited
optimism Thursday until prices slipped in the last hour.
   Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.,
a Baltimore brokerage, said computerized sell programs linked to
stock-index futures kicked in during the last hour of trading.
   Selling also apparently was sparked by rumors of a stock-related
scandal in the Japanese government, he said. The reports, which
Smith called ``ill-defined,'' could not be confirmed or denied
immediately.
   Philip Morris, one of the most active NYSE issues, was up { to
38&lsqb;. The company said its Kraft General Foods division would
aggressively seek acquisitions by about 1991.
   Union Carbide, another active blue-chip issue, was up 1&lsqb; at 23|
amid rumors of a possible takeover bid or the spinoff of a
division. The company declined to comment.
   Among other blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was down
| at 38&lsqb;, IBM was down 1&rsqb; at 103{ and General Electric was up &lsqb; to
60|.
   Monsanto jumped 4&rsqb; to 112\ on news that the Food and Drug
Administration approved the company's fat substitute for food
products, Simplesse.
   UAL dropped 5} to 126{. The Wall Street Journal reported that
the airline company's chairman, Stephen Wolf, decided not to back a
union-led employee buyout that didn't include him.
   Pfizer, another active NYSE issue, fell 4\ to 59{ on news
reports that it could face a major product-liability suit over a
heart valve once sold by a subsidiary.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.60 billion, or 0.33

   The Justice Department and Exxon Corp. are
near agreement on settling possible criminal charges over last
year's massive Alaska oil spill, several sources said Thursday.
   But Alaska officials said late Thursday they would not endorse a
tentative agreement outlined by the Justice Department and hoped
improvements can still be made that would make it acceptable to the
state.
   ``Under the proposed agreement the federal government would
abandon its commitment to Alaska to assist with its civil claims
against Exxon,'' complained Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily.
   He told reporters that the Justice Department was trying to
force the state to make ``a hasty endorsement'' of a plea
bargaining agreement that amounted to little more than ``a pig in a
poke'' and falls short of ensuring full restoration of damaged
resources.
   Environmental groups and a congressman also called the plea
bargaining inappropriate, accusing the Bush administration with
``pushing for a quick settlement'' that would allow Exxon to escape
more severe criminal penalties.
   ``From all accounts the Bush adminstration is giving Exxon a
wink and a nod ... a mere slap on the wrist,'' said Jay Hair,
president of the National Wildlife Federation.
   Justice Department spokesmen would only confirm that plea
negotiations have been under way with Exxon, whose tanker Exxon
Valdez released 11 million gallons of oil off Alaska in Prince
William Sound last March. It was the country's worst oil spill.
   But several sources both in and out of the government, all
speaking on condition that they not be identified, said a
settlement could be announced as early as Friday.
   Exxon announced Thursday it was taking another charge against
earnings of $300 million for litigation costs in connection with
the spill, bringing the company's total costs to more than $2
billion.
   The Justice Department talks with Exxon were said to revolve
around possible penalites of up to $500 million, to be paid over a
number of years by Exxon into a natural resources restoration for
Prince William Sound.
   One source said that under the draft agreement Exxon, would have
to pay only $150 million initially with the rest of the $500
million spread over seven years with each payment subject to
challenge by Exxon.
   ``If you read the fine print it could be substantially less'' in
actual payments overall, said the source, who spoke on the
condition that he not be identified.
   In addition, Justice has sought a lesser criminal fine, but the
amount could not be learned Thursday night.
   Exxon attorneys have tried to limit the amount of money they
must pay directly to the U.S. Treasury as criminal penalties,
preferring to pay most of the penalties into the restoration fund,
sources said.
   There was no answer at Exxon's offices in New York Thursday
evening. Earlier in the week, company spokesmen declined to discuss
the discussions with the Justice Department.
   Environmental lawyers said that money paid for restoration under
the criminal settlement could be tax deductible as an ordinary cost
of doing business and later may be used to reduce future
assessements against Exxon under various civil proceedings.
Criminal penalties could not be deducted from future assessements,
nor would they be tax deductible.
   Under two criminal statutes used by federal prosecutors in oil
spill cases, fines of up to double the cost of the cleanup could be
levied.
   ``The administration is moving too quickly,'' said Mike Matz of
the Sierra Club and chairman of the Alaska Coalition, a group of
environmental and civic organizations.
   ``Exxon is responsible for the worst environmental tragedy since
Three Mile Island and the Justice Department wants to punish them
with little more than a slap on the wrist.''
   Bob Adler, a spokesman for the Washington-based Natural
Resources Defense Council, said no settlement should be signed
before the extent of long-term damages to natural resources is even
known. He said $500 million would be ``grossly inadequate''
   In Alaska, state officials accused the Justice Department of
abandoning their state.
   ``If the latest draft of this agreement is imposed Alaska would
find itself on the short end of the stick. We are being asked to
accept a pig in a poke. ... And that pig smells awfully bad,'' said
a statement issued by the offices of Gov. Steve Cowper and Attorney
General Douglas Baily.
   Meanwhile, attorneys representing plaintiffs in civil suits
against Exxon filed a petition in federal court in Anchorage asking
that any plea bargaining agreement be subject to an open court
hearing before becoming final.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., also criticized the Justice
Department bargaining with Exxon, saying the agreement ``may not
provide full damages'' and might jeopardize the rights of other
parties seeking damages from Exxon.
   Miller, chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on water,
power and offshore energy resources, said the Bush administration
was moving too quickly.
   ``The criminal investigation hasn't even reached the stage of
indicting,'' Miller told reporters.
