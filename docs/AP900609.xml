<HEAD>24 Top Communists To Go on Trial for Genocide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-four top Communist officials who
backed the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's order to shoot at
demonstrators will go on trial for genocide, the Rompres news agency
reported.
   The defendants allegedly took part in two Politburo meetings
called by Ceausescu on December 17 and December 21, when the
dictator ordered the army and security forces to open fire on
demonstrators demanding his ouster, the report said Friday.
   At least 1,033 people died in the revolution that toppled
Ceausescu and ended Communist rule in Romania. Ceausescu and his
wife, Elena, were executed on Christmas Day.
   The defendants, scheduled to appear in court July 21, will
include former Premier Constantin Dascalescu, former Parliament
Speaker Nicolae Giosan and former Foreign Minister Ioan Totu,
Rompres said.

   An angry biologist led authorities to a
cache of rare armadillo, tiger and anaconda skins being sold
illegally in a perfume shop, government officials said.
   The skins came from animals killed illegally in the protected
Venezuelan jungles, the Environment Ministry said Friday. It said it
seized the skins.
   Biologist Henry Garcia reported the Caracas store to authorities
after seeing the skins there, the government news service Venpres
said.
   Killing rare animals for their skins, though illegal, is a
thriving and profitable business in Venezuela. The skins are often
exported to make expensive clothes, handbags and shoes.
   Authorities say the hunters are endangering the wildlife of the
Amazon jungle.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor peddled pedigreed
animals, classy clothes and celebrity souvenirs Friday at a
celebrity auction that she organized as penance for slapping a
policeman.
   The celebrity guest list included entertainers Valerie Harper,
Sally Struthers, Michelle Phillips, Cesar Romero, Esther Williams
and comedian Fred Travalena.
   The actress, dressed in a Christian Dior outfit, shrugged off a
judge's order that her auction not count as community service time
for her conviction.
   Miss Gabor said she learned from her celebrated trial that ``You
can't fight city hall'' but that the auction at the Beverly Hilton
hotel was something good that came out of the episode.
   Proceeds _ hopes ran around $60,000 _ from the affair were to go
to the Low Income Elderly United-Community Assistance Program, which
operates a shelter for homeless mothers in the beach community of
Venice.
   Miss Gabor was ordered to work for the shelter to fulfill
community service provisions of her sentence for slapping Beverly
Hills police Officer Paul Kramer on June 14, 1989.
   Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin, who sentenced her, ruled that
Miss Gabor must actually work at the shelter. He also increased her
community service when she tried to tell the court about all the
time she'd spent planning the auction.
   Auction fare included pedigreed dogs, cats and a horse; gowns by
big-name designers like Bob Mackie; and such celebrity-donated
bric-a-brac as drinking glasses from Bob Hope and some of Miss
Gabor's old movie memorabilia.
   Her publicists said Miss Gabor donated $30,000 worth of jewelry
and designer dresses. Former husband Barron Hilton donated one week
for two at the Hilton Hawaiian village.
   Sidney Sheldon donated an autographed copy of his book, ``The
Sands of Time'' and ``Phantom of the Opera'' star Robert Guillaume
donated four tickets and a backstage pass to the popular musical
play.
   The actress was sentenced to 120 hours of community service,
three days in jail and ordered to pay court costs and fines totaling
more than $12,000.
   The jail term has been stayed while she appeals her conviction.

   Trackers have captured three wild
elephants who swam a mile from the Malaysian jungle to an island
used by Singapore for military training, a newspaper said today.
   The male elephants were captured Thursday after Malaysian
National Park and Wildlife trackers used tranquilizer guns to subdue
them, the New Straits Times daily reported from Johore Bahru, 180
miles south of Kuala Lumpur.
   The elephants, found on uninhabited Tekong island last week, had
left a trail of uprooted trees and flattened grass. Singapore, which
controls the island, trains its armed forces there.
   The elephants are to be sent back to the Malaysian jungle in a
few days, said Bernard Harrison, executive director of the Singapore
Zoological Gardens.
   There are about 400 elephants in Malaysia. By law they cannot be
hunted or captured without permission.

   A Soviet airliner with 121 people aboard
was hijacked by a teen-age runaway carrying a fake grenade and
forced to land at an airport north of Stockholm early Saturday,
police said.
   No one was hurt in the hijacking and the 17-year-old Soviet
surrendered to authorities after the plane landed, police said.
   According to police statements, the young man had said that he
had decided to escape the Soviet Union after he was thrown out from
his parents' home.
   The young man's identity was not given. ``But he is not from one
of the Baltic countries,'' said Malin Engstedt, chief press
secretary of the Swedish Board of Civil Aviation. One police officer
at the airport said the hijacker was an ethnic Russian.
   The three-engine Aeroflot plane was carrying 114 passengers and a
seven-member crew from Minsk to Murmansk when it was hijacked and
flown to Arlanda international airport, 25 miles north of Stockholm,
the Swedish capital.
   The police searched the plane for explosives but did not find any.
   Swedish radio and the national news agency TT said the plane
would return to the Soviet Union later Saturday, but the hijacker
would remain for questioning.
   The last time a hijacked plane landed at Arlanda was in 1977.
That time the aircraft also came from the Soviet union.

<HEAD>Cheney: Remove Short-Range Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to
concerns that short-range nuclear missiles could leak plutonium, is
ordering Air Force bombers to stop carrying older missiles until
safety studies are completed.
   Cheney said in a statement Friday he was taking the step as ``a
precaution.''
   The directors of three U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories called
for the withdrawal of the weapons during congressional testimony
last month. They suggested there was a remote possibility the
weapons could leak plutonium in an accident.
   The missiles are known as the Short-Range Attack Missile-A, or
SRAM-As, and are carried aboard the nation's 372 deployed B-52, B-1B
and FB-111 bombers. The Air Force has said that 1,500 of the weapons
were produced between 1971 and 1975, but the current number deployed
is classified.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., chairman of the Armed Services strategic
forces subcommittee, which heard the lab directors' testimony,
agreed with the move.
   ``There was really nothing else the secretary could do,'' said
Exon, who was interviewed on Cable News Network.
   Cheney's statement said the weapons would not be placed on board
bombers on ``ground alert,'' the warplanes that are loaded with
weapons, fueled, and ready to fly to war, if necessary, within
minutes. The number of aircraft on such alert is classified.
   The weapons will be removed from the bombers pending the outcome
of Air Force and Energy Department safety studies, expected to be
completed this summer, the Pentagon statement said. The Energy
Department is in charge of nuclear weapons.
   Cheney decided to remove the weapons after discussions with
Energy Secretary James Watkins, the directors of the three
laboratories and after receiving ``additional information'' about
the SRAM-A, the statement said. It did not elaborate on what that
information might have been.
   The SRAM-A is not the only nuclear weapon carried by bombers. The
planes also carry a complement of longer-range nuclear missiles and
free-fall bombs. A new model short-range missile designated SRAM-2
is under development for deployment in 1993.
   The 14-foot long SRAM-A is an air-to-surface missile armed with
the W-69 nuclear warhead with an estimated explosive yield
equivalent to 170,000 tons of TNT, which is 11 to 13 times the power
of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.
   Some nuclear specialists have suggested it would be used against
targets that threatened the bombers themselves, such as radar
stations, fighter bases and antiaircraft missile sites, up to 100
miles away.
   The safety of the missile warhead was reviewed in 1989, and
because of that review, some procedures for handling the weapons
were modified.
   ``The laboratories have initiated new analyses. Until those
analyses are complete, I believe it is prudent to take this
action,'' the statement quoted Cheney as saying. ``The SRAM-A poses
no safety hazards to the public.''
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., called the move ``correct and
prudent.''
   ``The international strategic conditions have changed
dramatically in the last year as well, and we're not in the same
condition of need for as widespread an alert status as was
previously the case,'' he added.
   In their testimony May 23, the three laboratory directors said
the missile might be vulnerable to an accidental explosion of the
missile fuel that could disperse the highly toxic plutonium of the
weapon.
   An accident, such as a fire or crash, could not detonate the
plutonium, they said.
   The directors were John Nuckolls of the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, Sigfried Hecker of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico and Albert Narath of Sandia
National Laboratories in New Mexico.
   The withdrawal of the SRAM-A follows Cheney's disclosure in late
May that a safety problem existed with U.S. nuclear artillery shells
in Europe, but that it had been fixed and a risk of accidental
nuclear explosions never materialized.

   Justice John Mowbray called heads and
won a coin toss to get the job of chief justice of the Nevada
Supreme Court for the next two years.
   The chief's job is rotated every two years to a justice with two
years left in a six-year term. Mowbray and Justice Charles Springer
both were elected to their current terms in 1986, so a coin toss was
needed.
   Nevada's constitution prescribes the practice.
   ``There's probably not another state in the territory that does
it this way,'' said Mowbray, 71.
   Cliff Young, who will complete a two-year term as chief justice
in December, tossed a 50-cent piece in the air and told Mowbray and
Springer to call it.

   Robert Bork isn't entirely dejected about the
notoriety over his unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Supreme Court. He
just wishes people would stop recognizing him as C. Everett Koop.
   Both Bork and the former U.S. surgeon general sport beards _ Bork
a unique goatee and Koop a seaman's style.
   Bork said Friday he thinks it's nice that ``people now recognize
me wherever I go.'' But they're often confused about just why he's
famous.
   He recalled at a meeting of Texas lawyers that a woman came up to
him in a store and said, `` `Sir, we are heeding your warnings.' ''
Confused, Bork asked her what warnings she was referring to.
   The woman replied, ` ``Well, you're the surgeon general, aren't
you?' ''
   Bork was smoking a cigarette at the time. Koop waged war against
tobacco use while surgeon general.
   Bork, a former federal appeals judge, went to work for a
conservative think tank after the Senate in 1987 refused to confirm
his nomination for the Supreme Court.

   Actor John Cusack, who starred in
the teen-age love movie ``Say Anything,'' can't slip behind a wheel
for 90 days and must pay an $876 fine for driving drunk and crashing
his rented Jeep into a car.
   Cusack, 23, who also appeared in the film ``The Sure Thing,''
pleaded no contest to a first-time misdemeanor charge of driving
under the influence of alcohol.
   He sent his lawyer to the sentencing Friday and didn't appear in
court, prosecutor Greg Lawler said.
   Cusack's sentence was standard for the charge in California on a
first offense, Lawler said.
   Authorities said Cusack's blood alcohol level was .17 percent,
more than twice the state's legal limit of .08, after the Feb. 23
collision in West Hollywood.
   Neither Cusack nor the other driver was hurt.

   Former variety-show host Merv Griffin, who
created and produces ``Wheel of Fortune,'' says the game show is
considering whether to stop giving furs away to contestants.
   Griffin encountered a handful of animal rights activists
demonstrating outside a radio station where he appeared on a call-in
show Friday.
   The members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals held a
banner saying ``Wheel of Torture'' and chanted, ``Buy a vowel, not a
fur.''
   Griffin, in his limousine, did not stop to talk with the
demonstrators. But he said afterwards he had asked the game show's
management to reconsider the practice of giving away furs. He said a
decision should be reached soon.
   But Griffin also questioned whether there aren't more important
issues.
   ``I just don't know where it is in the scheme of things,''
Griffin said. ``I'm really focused in other directions. There are
major diseases we are all contending with and there are all the
homeless, and there are the ecological problems on the planet.''
   Griffin was host of ``The Merv Griffin Show'' for 23 years until

   When Peter Rowe decided to take his wife
out to dinner for her birthday, he took her way out _ 800 miles away.
   Not until she was over New York City on a chartered flight from
Michigan on Thursday night did Pat Rowe have the slightest idea
where she'd be celebrating her 40th birthday.
   At that point she shouted to her husband, ``We're going to New
Haven to have dinner at Leon's!''
   Leon's had been Pat's favorite restaurant when she and her
husband lived in Madison, Conn., until 1977. Then they moved to
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., about 800 miles away.
   When the time came to give her a special surprise, Peter decided
the party would be at Leon's. He chartered a jet, got six friends
from Michigan to go along, rented a limousine at Tweed-New Haven
Airport and arranged for two of Pat's sisters and their husbands to
meet them at the restaurant.
   ``It's wonderful,'' Pat said. ``It certainly makes my birthday
something to remember.''

   President Bush is pledging that a united
Germany will not threaten the Soviet Union but says he and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl have ``no specific formula'' to ensure
that.
   Bush and Kohl, after meeting Friday evening, continued to insist
on keeping a unified Germany in NATO _ something the Soviet Union
strongly opposes _ and Bush said they talked about ``an expanded
role'' for the Western alliance in the future.
   ``We also agree that the Soviets have understandable interests in
all of this but we did not try to fashion some compromise at this
juncture,'' he said in the Rose Garden where he and Kohl took
questions from reporters.
   Bush said further consultations will take place before and after
the July meeting of allied leaders in London.
   ``We will be talking to the other leaders in NATO about how we
lay to rest any concerns that the Soviets might have, by having an
expanded role that certainly will be seen to be as unthreatening to
the Soviet Union. But we had no formula that we agreed on,'' he said
of his two-hour meeting with Kohl.
   Bush and Kohl dined at the White House after the president
returned from a two-day politicking trip to the Midwest. Bush then
flew to Camp David, Md., for a weekend at the presidential
countryside retreat.
   Joining them for dinner were Vice President Dan Quayle, National
Security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III. Baker flew back Friday from Scotland where he met with
foreign ministers of 15 allied countries on future security for
Europe and the German question.
   Baker said in Scotland he had found the Soviet attitude about
enrolling a unified Germany in NATO ``much more encouraging'' since
Bush's summit talks with Gorbachev last week in Washington.
   ``A united Germany in NATO will not be threatening to the Soviet
Union,'' Bush vowed Friday night. ``A U.S. presence will not be
threatening to the Soviet Union. So we've just got to keep on making
our case.''
   Kohl said having Germany in NATO ``is of essential importance.''
   ``Any singling out and neutralization always means isolation,''
he added, noting that Germany's isolation during the 1920s led to
the chain of events that eventually saw the country divided in half
after World War II.
   As to the Soviet objections that having Germany in NATO would
threaten the Soviet security, Kohl held out hope that the roadblocks
could be solved so that unification talks could be complete by the
fall.
   ``I never expected this important question could be solved
overnight,'' he said.
   ``We as Germans as a matter of course ... also are going to bear
in mind Soviet security,'' Kohl vowed.
   Bush, who previously called for NATO to completely rethink its
military and political strategy, said that such a statementwas
unlikely to come out of the July NATO summit in London.
   However, he said the allies hope to ``more clearly define what
we're talking about'' on the matter of an expanded NATO.
   He said the meeting would more likely produce ``a common
direction'' for that concept, but not one with ``every `t' crossed
and every `i' dotted.''
   Earlier, between stops in the Midwest where he stumped for
gubernatorial and Senate candidates, Bush said he is considering
breaking off talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization after
the ``sheer terror'' of a thwarted Palestinian attack on an Israeli
beach.
   In Washington, a senior administration official said he expected
a 30-day suspension of the talks that began in December 1988, but
cautioned no final decision had been made.
   Bush called on PLO leader Yasser Arafat to publicly renounce the
attack and suggested the continuation of U.S.-PLO contacts depended
on Arafat's response.

<HEAD>Mitchell Threatens to Crack Down, Lengthen Work Week for Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell says
it's no more Mr. Nice Guy. Senators will have to start putting their
elected noses to the grindstone.
   Frustrated after a week in which no action was completed on the
four bills on his menu, Mitchell threatened Friday to crack the whip.
   In keeping with the Senate's leaning toward abundant etiquette,
Mitchell's warning came after consulting his Republican and
Democratic colleagues.
   Mitchell said he's thinking about putting a stop to four-day
weekends and shortening the four-week August recess so senators can
tend to legislative basics like the budget and defense and farm
legislation.
   The $98,000-a-year senators may also face the prospect of voting
in the morning and burning the midnight oil more than one night a
week, Mitchell said. Thursday is the only regular day for late-night
sessions.
   He didn't mention having the sergeant-at-arms make midnight
arrests and physically carry reluctant lawmakers to the Senate
floor. Democrats under former Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia resorted to that tactic in February 1988.
   ``We're just reaching the point where it is very, very difficult
to move forward on any piece of legislation,'' Mitchell said, adding
he was particularly perturbed at a higher-than-usual absentee rate.
   Senators had been asking him to put off important votes while
they went to graduations, to Czechoslovakia to monitor elections, or
make their regular weekend visits to home states to meet with
voters, raise money or electioneer.
   ``Obviously that circumstance cannot continue,'' Mitchell said.
``We all have an obligation to conduct the public business.''
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who once had Mitchell's job,
said forcing a senator to the floor is like leading a horse to water.
   ``It doesn't mean we're going to do anything in that time,'' Dole
said, explaining that Republicans don't share Mitchell's sense of
urgency about some of the legislation.
   But at least one Republican, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said
she was disappointed so few senators were around to vote on an
amendment she was seeking to protect the general aviation industry.
   Dole also joked that the public might like having their lawmakers
as far away from Washington as possible.
   ``We can't do anything to them while we're home,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson wants Mayor Marion Barry to
abandon his re-election bid and plans to discuss the mayor's
political future this weekend during a break in Barry's cocaine and
perjury trial, sources close to both men say.
   The talks will focus on Jackson's suggestion that Barry abandon
his re-election plans, the sources said Friday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Jackson publicly encouraged Barry this week to announce he won't
seek re-election in an attempt to spur plea bargaining talks that
would resolve the mayor's criminal case, which is absorbing the
capital city.
   On Friday, Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said, ``There is no
official plea bargaining under way and (Barry) has not made a
decision on re-election plans.''
   As for plea bargaining between prosecutors and Barry's defense
lawyer, one top city official said no meetings had been set up but
``there is an ongoing dialogue between them.'' He said the situation
was ``changing almost hourly.''
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens wants any bargain to include a
guilty plea on a felony charge. But the mayor is only willing to
consider pleading to misdemeanors, law enforcement and city
government sources say.
   Under federal sentencing guidelines, pleading guilty to a perjury
charge would guarantee that Barry would spend time behind bars. Once
he entered jail, he would be forced to give up the job he has held
since 1979.
   The first week of Barry's trial has been taken up with jury
selection, which is expected to continue all of next week. A jury
will be seated June 18, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson said.
   The jury pool for Barry's trial now stands at 48.
   Twelve additional jurors were sent into the pool Friday and one
already in the pool was excused.
   Judge Jackson says he plans to go through the remainder of the
250 people who have filled out questionnaires for the Barry trial.
So far, the judge and the lawyers in the case have examined some 90
questionnaires.

<HEAD>East German Wants to Make Reparations to Jews, But Could Cost
Billions</HEAD>

   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
wants to negotiate compensation for Jewish victims of the Nazi
Holocaust, but his country may not be able to afford the probably
astronomical cost.
   De Maiziere plans to meet Sunday in New York with representatives
of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims, set up in 1951 to
negotiate reparations for the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis, an
official of the World Jewish Congress said.
   The East German compensation could reach into the billions of
dollars, but might be limited by the government's financial
problems. East Germany, which ended nearly 45 years of communist
rule in the country's first free elections last March, is reuniting
with West Germany.
   The economic union of the two countries is scheduled to be
completed by July with West Germany expected to assume many of its
financially strapped neighbor's liabilities.
   Under a 1952 agreement, West Germany has paid more than $40
billion in reparations to Israel, to Jewish groups and to individual
claimants.
   The Luxembourg Agreement called for West Germany to pay
two-thirds of the total compensation.
   But East Germany's communist leaders, citing the systematic
persecution of communists by the Nazis, refused to recognize any
responsibility or to pay the remaining third of the claims. After
World War II, East Germany was dominated by the Soviet Union, which
had lost at least 20 million lives to the Nazis.
   One of the first acts of the new democratic East German
parliament was to concede a share of the blame for the Nazis' deeds.
   In a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman, de Maiziere said he
would be ``grateful if ... you were to initiate soonest
conversations'' with East German government experts ``in which a
settlement of the Jewish claims would be agreed on within the
framework of our possibilities.''
   A copy of the letter was made available to The Associated Press.
   De Maiziere's request to start negotiations ``is historic in that
it fulfills a pledge of the new government to assume moral
responsibility for the crimes of the Germans against the Jews,''
said WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg.
   He said the meeting Sunday between de Maiziere and the claims
body would be preliminary and would set up future negotiating
sessions.
   De Maiziere heads for Washington Monday to meet with President
Bush _ the first White House meeting between an East German prime
minister and a U.S. president.

   Under court order, striking railroad workers in
six states dismantled their pickets and went back to work for CSX
Transportation Inc.
   U.S. District Court Judge John R. Hargrove on Friday issued a
10-day temporary restraining order forcing the workers to end their
one-day walkout.
   ``The pickets came down between 11 a.m. and 2:30 or so and
everything is resumed,'' CSX spokesman Lindsay Leckie said Friday
night.
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers organized the
strike Thursday morning over the indefinite layoff of 11 crane
operators in Cumberland.
   ``We are complying with the judge's order. We're not going to
defy a federal judge,'' said George Laitila, a regional IBEW
representative.
   Laitila said thousands of union workers had honored picket lines
in Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Indiana and
Ohio. Leckie said it was impossible to know how many people refused
to cross the picket line.
   The walkout caused minor delays along 5,500 miles of the former
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad system, which runs through parts of
Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.
   About 7,400 riders on two Maryland commuter lines were forced to
find other ways to and from their jobs in Washington, D.C., on
Friday.
   Another CSX spokesman, Lloyd D. Lewis, said the judge decided
``this was a minor dispute that did not allow the union to strike.''
Laitila disagreed, and said the union would present its case in a
federal court hearing.
   The union contended that CSX violated an agreement with the
electrical workers when it announced a furlough last week of 45
employees, including the crane operators, at a train yard in
Cumberland, Md.

<HEAD>Panel Hears Testimony on Possible Changes in Child Labor Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crackdown on child labor law violations could
ruin work opportunities for youngsters, says a Texas businessman
facing fines from a nationwide Labor Department sweep.
   Donald Farrell told the House Government Operations employment
and housing subcommittee on Friday that jobs like those he provides
give youngsters, especially those from unstable homes, a chance to
earn money, experience and self-respect.
   ``Please do not allow misguided idealism and governmental
paternalism to close that door. They desperately need an alternative
to the street corner and the dangers associated with that
irresponsible lifestyle,'' Farrell said.
   Farrell's Dallas business is under investigation for allegedly
letting nearly 300 children illegally sell newspaper subscriptions
at night.
   Farrell faces $150,000 in fines for alleged violations uncovered
in a nationwide Labor Department sweep in March. He was one of
several business officials who testified as the panel continued
hearings on protecting children in the workplace.
   Two high school students also testified, saying their grades had
slipped because they were devoting too much time to their jobs.
   Christopher Randolph, a senior from Clifton Park, N.Y., said
teen-agers were ``easy marks for exploitation.''
   Congress is considering legislation to increase civil fines for
child labor law violations from $1,000 a violation to $10,000. The
legislation also would require jail terms for repeat and willful
offenders.
   Along with congressional attention, the Labor Department has
stepped up its enforcement. The nationwide sweep conducted in March
uncovered 15,000 alleged violations. Federal agents followed with a
one-day effort this week by visiting another 2,000 establishments.

   An international health organization has
started a 10-year program to help developing companies control
tropical diseases such as intestinal worms and malaria.
   International Medical Services for Health, based in Leesburg,
Va., said Friday it is raising money from companies, individuals and
foundations to help Third World countries solve their health
problems.
   ``We know we can affect the lives of 500 million people by the
year 2000,'' said Linda Pfeiffer, president of the nonprofit
international health organization.''
   More than 3 billion people _ half the world's population _ are
afflicted by intestinal worms, malaria and schistosomiasis, she said.
   ``We can't do it for the whole world by the year 2000 ... but for
this large part of the population we can contain it,'' she said in
an interview.
   Officials of the organization were holding a two-day conference
in Washington with representatives of nonprofit groups from 25
countries and public health experts to work on the project, called
the Millennium Program.
   The conference was sponsored by an educational grant from
SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, one of about 25 drug companies
that contribute to the organization.

<HEAD>Congressman Seeks Better Discipline For Physicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should help in disciplining and
weeding out bad physicians by making doctors more accountable to
their state licensing boards, Rep. Ron Wyden says.
   The Oregon Democrat endorsed the recommendations of an inspector
general's report, saying he'll introduce legislation to force
federally supported peer review groups to give state medical boards
information about their investigations of doctors.
   ``Too many incompetent physicians can slip through the
disciplinary net and continue to inflict bad medical care on
patients for extended periods of time,'' he said.
   The peer review organizations study complaints about physicians
who receive money from Medicare.
   But little of that information is passed along to boards that
license doctors and investigate complaints about their practices,
witnesses told the House Small Business subcommittee on regulation.
   Richard Kusserow, inspector general for the Department of Health
and Human Services, said the review organizations have lots of
information about bad doctors but are unwilling to share much of it
because they fear legal retribution.

   A bruised Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., thanked
the quick action of passersby for saving him from more serious
injury in a sidewalk attack. Investigators were seeking a motive in
the case.
   Studds rested in his Provincetown, Mass., summer home today
recovering from cuts and bruises inflicted by two men who beat him
up on a Washington street corner early Friday.
   Four pedestrians saw the assault and chased away the attackers,
but Studds had already been knocked down and beaten, said Steven
Schwadron, a spokesman for the nine-term Democrat.
   ``The witnesses were really phenomenal,'' Schwadron said. ``What
they did is what convinced the guys to flee.''
   The passersby flagged down a U.S. Secret Service car that
happened to be driving through the area. A short time later two
uniformed agents arrested the suspects, who had blood on their hands
and clothing. The Secret Service said the suspects later admitted to
the beating.
   ``Gerry was mugged and beaten up pretty bad, but the bottom line
is he's OK,'' Schwadron said.
   The attackers knocked Studds down, then punched and kicked him in
the head and body while a third man egged them on early Friday,
according to U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.
   Thomas Carter, 18, of Gaithersburg, Md., and James Byrne, 19, of
Silver Spring, Md., were charged in federal court Friday with
assault on a member of Congress with resulting injury. The charge is
a felony that carries penalties of up to 10 years in jail and a
$10,000 fine upon conviction.
   A third suspect was released because he was not directly involved
in the beating, said Secret Service Officer Kevin S. Porter, who
took part in the arrest.
   In a sworn, written statement to the court, Porter quoted Carter
as saying shortly after his arrest: ``It seemed like the thing to do
at the time.'' Once in his cell, Carter was overheard saying, ``I
beat up a congressman.'' Porter quoted Byrne as saying: ``I only hit
the dude a couple of times.''
   Studds, 53, is one of two members of Congress who has publicly
stated that he is homosexual, but Schwadron said there was no
indication that was a motive for the attack.
   ``There doesn't seem to have been any clear motive,'' Schwadron
said. ``There was no robbery.''
   The incident occurred at about 12:30 a.m. in the DuPont Circle
neighborhood of Washington, a block from where Studds lives,
according to Stevens. Studds' office said the congressman was
returning home alone from dinner at a friend's house.
   He was treated at the scene by an ambulance crew, Allan Cramer, a
Secret Service spokesman said.
   The attack apparently did not disrupt the congressman's schedule.
Schwadron said Studds kept an appointment to meet a group of
students from a Cape Cod high school on the Capitol steps Friday
morning.

<HEAD>New Gov't Policies Could Cause More Tension with Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hard-line policies toward Palestinians
espoused by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new right-wing
government could worsen already strained relations with the United
States.
   Shamir formed his government Friday, breaking a deadlock that
began March 15 when the governing coalition collapsed over Shamir's
failure to endorse U.S. proposals for Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
   The new government has pledged to expand settlements in the
occupied lands and use harsh measures to quell the Arab uprising,
both moves that could aggravate tensions with Washington.
   The government, which still needs parliamentary approval, has
also ruled out talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization _
which Israel views as a terrorist group _ and any negotiations
concerning the status of Jerusalem, which it considers ``Israel's
eternal capital.''
   Washington has pressed for Israeli-Palestinian talks and does not
recognize Israel's annexation of Arab east Jerusalem. It has called
settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip obstacles to
peace, and has called on the Israeli army to use restraint in
supressing Palestinian protests.
   Shamir said Friday that his government's main goal would be to
settle the influx of Soviet Jews, expected to total 150,000 this
year. He called the immigration ``the most important issue we are
facing today.''
   The government also pledged to retain its May 1989 peace
initiative promising Palestinians elections, but vowed to ``uproot
the phenomenon of violence and disturbances'' _ a reference to the
Palestinian uprising.
   Faisal Husseini, a leading pro-PLO activist in the occupied
territories, said the new government will create ``more obstacles in
the way of peace.''
   ``I believe this government will try to crush the uprising, and
the uprising will prove there is no way to crush it,'' he said.
``But the price will be high.''
   The rival Labor Party called the new coalition ``a government
whose principles and policies deviate from the interests of Israel
and its citizens, the most anti-Israeli government that ever arose.''
   Labor leader Shimon Peres predicted the coalition would be
plagued by infighting, saying: ``Most of its time and energy will be
spent in holding it together.'' Peres, Shamir's rival, tried for 35
days to form a Cabinet before surrendering the task to Shamir.
   Shamir telephoned President Chaim Herzog to report the formation
of the government just hours before his 42-day mandate expired at
sundown.
   A vote in the Knesset, or parliament, could be scheduled as early
as Monday.
   In the new government, Shamir's Likud bloc will have full control
for the first time since 1984. Close election results since then had
forced Likud into power-sharing arrangements with the left-center
Labor Party.
   The new coalition includes two nationalist parties, three
religious ones, two one-man factions and a defector from Labor.
   Under the coalition agreement, Shamir would have 62 votes in the
120-member Knesset. But the coalition is shaky and divided, prone to
pressures from some of the eight factions comprising it, notably two
ultra-Orthodox parties.
   The two decisive votes came from the nationalist Moledet, or
Homeland party, which promised to support the government but refused
to join it. One nationalist party within the coalition got the
freedom to vote as it wants on peace moves.
   According to officials in Shamir's office, key posts in the new
Cabinet went to Likud hard-liners. The most controversial of the
reported appointments appeared to be that of Ariel Sharon as
minister of housing.
   Sharon was the architect of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and
is a strong backer of Israel's settlement drive. Asked about moving
Soviet Jews to the occupied territories, Sharon reiterated the
government's stand that ``everyone can settle where he wants.''
   The government's guidelines and the coalition agreement include
many promises to meet demands of the small parties. These included
legislation banning the sale of pork in line with religious
commandments and increased observance of the Jewish Sabbath.
   Shamir dismissed claims that his government would be subject to
religious coercion and far-right pressures.
   ``This government represents many circles in Israel,'' he said.
``It is a broad-based nationalistic government. It is not right-wing
and not narrow.''

   Here are thumbnail sketches of four key members
of the new right-wing Israeli coalition government. Cabinet posts
have not been formally assigned and the new government will not be
approved by the Knesset, or parliament, until at Monday at the
earliest.
   _ Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister. The Polish-born Shamir, 74, has
been premier off-and-on since 1983, most recently as head of the
coalition that collapsed in March with the left-center Labor Party.
He was co-leader of the Stern Gang, the most radical movement
fighting for creation of the Jewish state. Later, he was an agent
for the Mossad secret service. In politics, he climbled the ranks
through loyalty to Likud founder and ex-Prime Minister Menachem
Begin. He opposed giving up the Sinai Peninsula to make peace with
Egypt and has resisted U.S.-proposed compromises for opening peace
talks with Palestinians.
   _ Ariel Sharon, housing minister. Sharon is known for his
hard-line views on keeping the occupied territories and halting the
Palestinian uprising. Sharon, 62, also will head a powerful, special
committee in charge of the wave of Soviet Jewish immigration to
Israel. A native-born Israeli and former general, he was a hero in
the 1967 and 1973 wars, but was blamed for leading Israel into the
unpopular 1982 Lebanon war. In 1983, he was forced to step down as
defense minister when an inquiry found him responsible for the
massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in two Beirut refugee camps.
The inquiry commission said Sharon should have realized what would
happen if he let Israel's Christian militia allies enter the camps.
   _ Moshe Arens, defense minister. Arens was born in Lithuania but
educated as an engineer in the United States. In Israel, he was a
professor of aeronautical engineering and deputy director of the
government-sponsored aircraft industry. Arens, 64, was ambassador to
the United States in 1982-83 and defense minister in Shamir's
government in 1983-84. As foreign minister in the most recent
Cabinet, he often echoed Shamir's views and was the chief spokesman
in the campaign to brand the PLO a terrorist organization.
   _ David Levy, foreign minister. Levy was born in Morocco and is
the leading politician among Israel's Sephardis, or Jews of North
African and Middle Eastern descent. Levy, 52, was a construction
worker who entered politics through Israel's federation of labor
unions. He has been immigration minister and in the latest Cabinet
was vice premier and housing minister. Word that he might be foreign
minister raised criticism because he does not speak English well,
though he is fluent in French. He and Sharon are Shamir's chief
rivals in Likud and have consistently pushed far-right positions.

<TEXT>
   American educator Thomas Sutherland today
began his sixth year as a hostage, and his wife and friends at the
American University of Beirut gathered to mark the grim milestone
and discuss his life and work.
   Since Sutherland was captured June 9, 1985, the only word on his
condition has come from former hostages who were held with him. The
pro-Iranian group that holds him, Islamic Jihad, has never issued a
photograph of Sutherland as it has its other captives.
   Students and colleagues who gathered Friday to mark the
anniversary of Sutherland's captivity recalled his commitment to the
American University of Beirut. The Scottish-born, 59-year-old
educator from Fort Collins, Colo., was dean of agriculture and food
sciences at the school when he was kidnapped.
   ``People who have come out from where he is and who have been
with him say that Tom speaks and thinks of AUB and wants to come
back,'' said Sutherland's wife, Jean.
   ``The four things that mean the most to Tom ... are his home, his
family, his work and his friends, and he found all four of those
here in Beirut and at AUB,'' she said. She spoke at the lecture hall
in the university's agriculture building.
   One of those attending was Elham Cicippio, the wife of American
hostage Joseph Cicippio, who was the acting comptroller at the
university. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   In addition to Sutherland and Cicippio, 14 other Westerners are
missing in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985. Next to Anderson, Sutherland has been held the longest.
   Most of the hostages are held by pro-Iranian Shiite factions.
   Mrs. Sutherland still lives at the American University in Moslem
west Beirut, continuing the work she and her husband were doing when
he was abducted.
   ``Tom and I are ordinary people,'' she said Friday. ``We came
here to do a job. The job is still to be done, and we're still doing
it.
   She said what her husband is going through is ``only a
reflection, a shadow of what the people in Lebanon'' have gone
through in 15 years of civil war.
   ``We hope that ... when he comes out, it means reconciliation, it
means that people are not divided, that people are on their way to
work together in peace and harmony,'' she said.
   She and the students on pinned photographs of Sutherland to a
board in the hall.
   The Sutherlands have three daughters: Ann, 32; Kit, 30; and Joan,
26. They all live and work in the United States.
   Former hostages have told Mrs. Sutherland that her husband's
captors had given him a picture she placed in a newspaper of his
only granddaughter, Simone, 3, who was born after his abduction.
   Sutherland was seized as he drove from the airport after arriving
from the United States to attend the graduation of his students.
Mrs. Sutherland told The Associated Press her husband had been
hesitant about returning to Beirut because of the civil war and
kidnappings.
   She recalled that in the last week before he returned to Beirut,
an interviewer asked her husband whether he was afraid.
   ``He said, `If I'm going to be afraid, I'd better not be there.'''

   A federal judge rejected Manuel Noriega's claim that
the United States has no jurisdiction to indict him on charges he
trafficked drugs as Panama's leader.
   In a second blow Friday to Noriega's legal defense, a
co-defendant in a parallel Tampa indictment named the ousted
Panamanian dictator as a ``silent partner'' in a drug ring.
   In Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler rejected defense
claims that Noriega had immunity for his actions and could not be
prosecuted for activities outside the United States.
   In Tampa, Panamanian jeweler Enrique A. ``Kiki'' Pretelt admitted
in a plea agreement that he helped launder drug proceeds with two
convicted Tampa drug smugglers, according to a 10-page plea
agreement.
   ``A fourth silent partner in their business was Gen. Manuel
Noriega,'' the agreement said.
   Noriega, in prison outside of Miami, is accused in a February
1988 indictment of taking $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a way station for
U.S.-bound drugs.
   Hoeveler ruled that the argument Noriega had ``sovereign
immunity'' as head of state failed because the United States never
recognized him in that role.
   ``Given the serious nature of the drug epidemic in this country,
certainly the efforts of the U.S. to combat the problem by
prosecuting conduct directed against itself cannot be subject to the
protest of a foreign nation profiting at U.S. expense,'' the judge
said.
   Noriega's lawyers also argued that the indictment should be
dismissed because the U.S. invasion of Panama leading to Noriega's
arrest was so bloody it should ``shock the conscience.''
   Hoeveler rejected that argument too. ``Noriega's complaint is a
challenge to the very morality of war itself,'' he said. ``This is a
political question.''
   Defense attorney Jon May said the rulings cannot be appealed
until after the trial.
   Under the agreement accepted by U.S. District Judge William
Castagna in Tampa, Pretelt promised to cooperate fully, testify and
turn over any relevant documents to prosecutors. He also will
forfeit $108,000.
   Pretelt, 47, acknowledged conspiring with Noriega to take bribes
from the drug smugglers to help ferry $300 million worth of
Colombian marijuana through Panama and hide the profits.
   The agreement said Noriega and the other partners received a
commission every time Steven Michael Kalish deposited drug proceeds
in Panamanian bank accounts. They were to receive $4 million, but
Kalish was arrested before 200 tons of marijuana concealed in a
shipment of plantain bananas was completed.
   The bananas were to be relabled in Panama to conceal their
Colombian origin.
   Kalish has pleaded guilty to other drug charges and testified
before a U.S. Senate subcommittee that the bribes were part of more
than $4 million in cash, jewelry and airplanes his ring gave to
Noriega and his associates.
   In return, Noriega gave Kalish a diplomatic passport, false
Panamanian customs documents to disguise drug shipments from
Colombia and provided armored car service to shuttle cash, according
to the indictment.
   Defense attorney George Tragos said Pretelt, the lone
co-defendant in the parallel drug indictment, obtained a ``great
deal'' because prosecutors in Noriega's drug racketeering case in
Miami want his cooperation.
   ``I think the biggest single incentive the government had for the
plea agreement is the testimony about General Manuel Noriega,''
Tragos said.
   Pretelt pleaded guilty to two of his three drug counts, and will
be sentenced to no more than 10 years in federal prison. Prosecutors
will also recommend that immigration authorities not deport him to
Panama if his testimony puts him in jeopardy. Sentencing is set for
Aug. 16.
   Pretelt went underground soon after the U.S. invasion of Panama
on Dec. 20 and surrendered Jan. 17. Noriega also fled, taking refuge
for 10 days at a Vatican diplomatic compound before surrendering to
FBI agents in Panama.

   The inventor of a push-button device that
lets people kill themselves painlessly says terminally ill people
seeking his help will be distraught to learn he's under court orders
not to use it.
   ``I'll tell them, `I'm sorry, I can't help you. It's illegal,'''
said Dr. Jack Kevorkian, shaking his head after he was slapped with
an injunction Friday that also barred him from helping people use
any other means to commit suicide.
   ``It's the end of Dr. K. helping patients die,'' said Kevorkian,
a 62-year-old retired pathologist who this week aided the suicide of
a woman diagnosed a year ago with Alzheimer's disease.
   Judge Alice Gilbert of Oakland County Circuit Court ordered
Kevorkian to stop using his machine until prosecutors decide whether
to try him in the suicide Monday of Janet Adkins, 54, of Portland,
Ore.
   Kevorkian hooked Adkins up to his suicide machine in his van,
parked in a state park, and she pressed a button that triggered a
flow of coma- and death-inducing drugs into her veins.
   Michigan law makes neither suicide nor doctor-assisted suicide a
crime, and assistant prosecutor Michael Modelski said there were no
immediate plans to prosecute.
   But the county prosecutor, state police and Michigan medical
association are investigating the death of Adkins.
   ``Everything about this case points to irresponsibility,'' said
Modelski, calling Kevorkian ``an Angel of Death.''
   ``He sort of revels in the fact that he's sort of an outcast,''
Modelski said.
   Kevorkian said, ``I don't enjoy seeing people die.'' But ``the
elderly are killing themselves by all kinds of violent means. They
deserve options.''
   He said two women in their 80s who heard about the Adkins case
contacted him to offer their support for his device.
   ``They were weeping on the phone,'' the doctor said. ``They know
that this option is available if they need it.
   Kevorkian said he probably won't appeal Gilbert's decision, which
Modelski said is effective statewide.
   ``Since he's only licensed in Michigan, that should shut him
down,'' Modelski said.
   The doctor, who acted as his own lawyer at the hearing, had asked
the judge for a partial injunction which would allow use of his
machine in ``a specific set of circumstances.''
   He said he wanted time to set up a committee of specialists to
establish a permanent ``planned death policy,'' and establish an
``obitorium,'' a clinic for the terminally ill who want medical help
with suicide.
   ``Let me put together a small team, called the Untouchables,''
Kevorkian said. ``I guarantee, under my supervision, it would be
incorruptible.''
   Kevorkian's sister, Flora Holzheimer of Frankfurt, West Germany,
testified that she spent last Saturday with her brother, Mrs. Adkins
and Mrs. Adkins husband, Ronald.
   Holzheimer said that when she picked up Mrs. Adkins Monday for
the suicide crusade: ``It was a sad affair. She had her bag in her
hand, her husband straightened his tie ... they said their
goodbyes.''

<HEAD>U.S. Navy Officer Faces Trial For Rape Of Female Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy lieutenant faces trial next
month for allegedly raping a female officer aboard an ammunition
ship while it was in port in Spain, a Navy spokesman said.
   Lt. j.g. Robin E. Brown, 27, has been charged with one count of
rape under the military code of justice and is awaiting judicial
proceedings at the Naval Station in Rota, Spain, said Navy Lt. Scott
Campbell, public affairs officer in Naples.
   Brown's hometown was not immediately known, Campbell said in a
telephone interview late Friday.
   Brown is scheduled to go on trial for the alleged offense July 2
in Naples, Italy, Campbell said.
   The offense allegedly took place April 4 in the female officer's
stateroom aboard the USS Suribachi. The Navy said it was withholding
the woman's name and rank out of respect for her privacy. The woman
is still on board the ammunition ship, while Brown has been assigned
to other duties, the spokesman said.
   Maximum punishment for the offense is loss of all pay and
military allowances from date of conviction, dismissal from the
military and 30 years at hard labor, Campbell said.
   A pretrial investigation of the incident was conducted May 11 at
the Naval Station in Rota, he said. The charge was referred to a
general court martial proceeding, which was held May 26.
   Defense motions are expected to be made on June 15, with the
trial to follow in July, Campbell said.
   The report of the alleged incident comes as the Navy has been
struggling with the issue of the treatment of women within its ranks.
   The service has come under particular scrutiny after a female
midshipman, Gwen Dreyer, resigned from the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., after she was handcuffed to a urinal and
photographed by some male classmates.
   Her action prompted others, including men, to report hazing
incidents at the military school.
   The incident also prompted the academy's superintendent, Rear
Adm. Virgil Hill, to take a number of steps to tighten rules against
harassement.
   Those found guilty of physical or mental abuse against plebes _
first year students _ now face expulsion.
   The academy also instituted a new program of sensitivity training
for midshipmen that focuses on sexual harassment and equal
opportunities.

<HEAD>Honecker, Former Aides Examined to Determine If Fit For Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors are examining former hard-line
Communist leader Erich Honecker and other top members of his ousted
regime to determine whether they are well enough to be jailed, an
East German official said.
   Despite Health Minister Juergen Kleditzsch's announcement, it
remains questionable whether the leaders of the former regime will
go on trial.
   Kleditzsch's statement Friday marked the latest in a series of
changing signals regarding the hated 77-year-old Honecker, who ruled
East Germany in an authoritarian manner for 18 years until his
downfall last October.
   Officials said late last year they would try Honecker for high
treason, but later said they were dropping prosecution plans
altogether because of the deposed leader's failing health.
   There has been similar uncertainty regarding the trials of some
of Honecker's aging and ailing former top lieutenants. Most of the
allegations against them center on corruption and abuse of office.
   In a parliamentary debate broadcast live on East German
television, Kleditzsch indicated that some criminal proceedings are
again being considered.
   ``At the request of the chief prosecutor, there is a team of
expert doctors dealing with whether Honecker and other members of
the Communist Party and national leadership can be jailed and
interrogated,'' said Kleditzsch.
   The health minister added that Honecker and the others, whom he
did not name, have been in a government hospital in East Berlin
since May 28.
   Kleditzsch offered no further details. Earlier in the debate, one
member of parliament, Bernhardt Opitz, said he wanted to know
whether Honecker can be tried for ``crimes against humanity.''
   The other top target of the criminal allegations is Erich Mielke,
the 82-year-old former head of the once-dreaded secret police.
   At the moment the county is grappling with other major problems
that might make many East Germans eager to avoid what would likely
become a major show trial.
   Those problems include massive unemployment and possible unrest
likely to grip the country late this summer and in the autumn, once
the West German currency replaces the East German mark as part of
the economic merger of the two Germanys.
   East German leaders also are working to resolve the stalemate
over the question of the military status of a united Germany. The
Soviet Union has opposed proposals that a unified Germany belong to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Last month, Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said
Honecker's failing health made a trial unlikely.
   Diestel, who is also the country's deputy prime minister, said he
would not consider such a prosecution simply as a means of
``appeasing the people's anger.''
   Honecker was arrested on Jan. 29, freed the following day and
sent to live with a Lutheran pastor and his wife in the town of
Lobetal.
   The former leader, who suffers from kidney cancer, was later
taken to the Soviet military hospital in the town of Beelitz before
his transfer to the government hospital in East Berlin.

<HEAD>Multiparty System Faces Decisive Test In Algeria, Tunisia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voter readiness to accept multiparty
democracy is being put to a decisive test in Algeria and Tunisia in
local elections Sunday and Tuesday.
   In each of the North African neighbors, the governing party has
held sole power since French colonial rule ended decades ago, and
that party is virtually certain to win control of a large majority
of councils.
   The main question is the level of support amassed by radical
Islamic groups among voters unaccustomed to being given a choice.
   Fundamentalist groups have aligned under the banner of the
Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria, where Tuesday's election will be
the first under a multiparty system. The Front's candidates are
running in almost all the 1,541 municipalities and provincial
councils.
   But in Tunisia, the government has withheld official recognition
of Islamic groups on the grounds that God belongs to all Tunisians.
The fundamentalists have declared an official boycott of Sunday's
elections, so anti-government sentiment will be gauged by the number
of abstentions.
   The elections will be the second time Tunisian voters have had a
free choice.
   In legislative elections in 1988, the governing Constitutional
Democratic Rally won every seat in the National Assembly. Opposition
parties later accused the party in power of having abused its
control of state funds, transport and mass media.
   By contrast, a genuine election contest is expected in Algeria.
Almost all parties will compete and have proclaimed in advance that
they will accept the results.
   However, the Algerian situation is not simple. Many democratic
parties, seeking an alternative to both the government and the
fundamentalists, have entered candidates. But they are divided, in
some cases more hostile to each other than to the governing National
Liberation Front. One coalition, the Front of Socialist Forces, has
called for an election boycott despite its potential for a strong
showing.
   Another factor is the position taken by the followers of Ahmed
Ben Bella, the former president ousted by a military coup in 1965
and now an exile in Switzerland. Both the National Liberation Front
and the fundamentalists have urged backers of Ben Bella's Movement
for Democracy in Algeria to join their side, but Ben Bella has given
no endorsement.
   The future stance of the powerful Algerian army also remains in
doubt. The fundamentalists are openly calling for military
intervention to establish an ``Islamic republic,'' but senior army
officers seem more likely to support a state free of religious
interference.
   In both Tunisia and Algeria, the vote is for a list of locally
selected party candidates. In each, an official result may not be
announced for days.
   In one respect, the two voting systems differ markedly.
   Tunisia has a Western-style one-person, one-vote system resulting
from a modern family code established by former President Habib
Bourguiba. In Algeria, the family code is based on Islamic
principles, and a man can vote on behalf of his wife _ or wives _
without having to produce any document authorizing him to do so.

   Roy and Marge Heimdal waited this weekend for
word about their kidnapped son after they wired $60,000 from a
frantic fund-raising campaign to the guerrillas believed to be
holding him in Colombia.
   The Heimdals marched into a bank Friday clutching coffee cans
stuffed with dollar bills about 90 minutes before a deadline to wire
the money to a bank in Quito, Ecuador.
   They also sent a videotaped plea for mercy for their son, Scott
Heimdal, 27, who was ambushed April 28 in northern Ecuador.
   ``I pleaded for my son's life,'' Mrs. Heimdal said. ``I begged. I
said, `Please give me my son back. He's my only son.'''
   ``I've never begged before. I don't know if I did it right.''
   An intermediary was to take the money into the jungle along the
Ecuador-Colombia border this weekend in search of the kidnappers,
whom U.S. officials have identified as Maoist guerrillas.
   The kidnappers originally sought $1.2 million but lowered their
demand to $60,000.
   But the Heimdals lost their life savings paying medical bills
after Mrs. Heimdal, 47, was severely injured in an accident with an
uninsured drunken driver several years ago. On Tuesday they went on
television to appeal for help raising the ransom.
   Nursing homes held bake sales, waitresses donated their tips and
children handed over their piggy banks, and in four days the
Heimdals had $60,000.
   ``A shiver went down my spine when they told me we had $60,000,''
Roy Heimdal said. ``I'm stunned.''
   The Heimdals declined to disclose exactly how much money was
raised, fearing the kidnappers might demand more. They have promised
a full accounting after their son's release.
   Even as the Heimdals fought their way through a herd of reporters
into the bank, strangers approached with dollar bills for their
overflowing coffee cans and words of encouragement.
   ``I just want you to know we're all pulling for you,'' an
unidentified young girl told Mrs. Heimdal before walking off.
   The family hopes the ordeal will be capped next week by a
communitywide welcome home celebration for their son, who has worked
the past two years for International Mining Co., which mines gold
near Quito.
   He was traveling by boat with four others when the group was
ambushed. The pilot was killed and another was injured.
   The kidnappers, reportedly members of a Colombian group known as
the Popular Liberation Army, have threatened to ``show us where his
body is,'' Mrs. Heimdal said.
   In Quito, Jeffrey Fino, manager of Iminco in Ecuador, reported no
progress Friday in negotiations to free Scott Heimdal.
   A government source who demanded anonymity told The Associated
Press that low-profile negotiations are most likely to succeed. The
source said a Spanish bull salesman kidnapped last month in Quito
was released unharmed upon payment of $1 million, and lack of
publicity helped the negotiations.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Devalues Currency in Advance of Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-backed government has devalued
the national currency for the 11th time in six weeks in advance of a
regional summit where Nicaragua will appeal for economic cooperation.
   The official ratio of Nicaraguan cordobas to U.S. dollars rose
from 170,000:1 to 185,000:1 with Friday's action. Gas prices also
increased by 1.4 cents a gallon.
   On the eve of the devaluation and price hikes, presidential
spokesman Danilo Lacayo said the economy will be the main subject of
the Central American summit, scheduled for June 15 in Guatemala.
   ``Democracy will be established in the same measure that
economically strong countries give Central America the chance of
pulling ahead,'' he said in comments broadcast on national radio.
``Social and economic development benefits peace in the region.''
   Lacayo said the administration of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has
contributed its share to bringing peace to the region. He pointed to
both the plan to disband the Contra rebels and reduce the size of
the army.
   The advent of Mrs. Chamorro's government to power six weeks ago
brought hopes for an end to the country's nine-year-old civil war.
The U.S.-backed Contras had battled the leftist Sandinista
government, which was defeated in February elections.
   The dismantling of the Contra army, which was suspended several
times, has picked up steam since rebel leaders and Mrs. Chamorro's
administration signed an accord on May 30.
   It calls for the rebels to surrender their weapons by June 10. It
also stipulates the creation of regional development centers for
disarmed rebels, which they can police on their own.
   As of Thursday, 6,842 rebels had disarmed in seven security zones
nationwide, said an official of the U.N. peacekeeping mission for
Central America.
   However, Contra leaders have estimated the size of their force at
13,000.
   In addition, Mrs. Chamorro is studying a plan to trim the
Sandinista People's Army. The president is expected to announce the
final plan Sunday.
   Nicaragua hopes to promote peace and economic development with
the help of $300 million in emergency aid approved by the U.S.
Congress last month and $120 million promised during a conference of
donor countries in Rome on Thursday.
   The donor countries also promised Nicaragua $180 million more for
1991.
   Participants in the summit will be Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa
Rica, Honduras and Guatemala.

   Sheriff's deputies made their first
arrest of a record retailer under a federal judge's ruling deeming a
rap record by 2 Live Crew obscene. The band's leader said his record
label will help pay legal fees.
   The group performed its sexually explicit material live in Miami
Beach early today. Authorities did not interfere with the 45-minute
show.
   The audience cheered when band leader Luther Campbell shouted
vulgarities about Gov. Bob Martinez and Broward County Sheriff Nick
Navarro, whose deputies Friday arrested E-C Records owner Charles
Freeman, 31, on misdemeanor charges of distributing obscene material.
   The deputies burst into the store after an undercover agent
bought the group's recording ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday is obscene. The
ruling did not affect live performances.
   If convicted, Freeman could be sentenced to a year in jail and
fined $1,000. He was released from county jail on $100 bond.
   ``The inevitable has finally occurred,'' said Robyn E. Blumner,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida.
``Someone in Broward is facing jail time because he sold a record
album to an adult.
   ``That action put south Florida about on a par with Eastern
Europe _ a year ago.''
   Blumner said the ACLU will offer to represent Freeman. ``Someone
has got to stand up and say this is wrong,'' she said.
   Freeman's case probably will go before a jury that will have to
decide whether the album is criminally obscene.
   Gonzalez found in a civil case that the sexually explicit
recording was without social value, appealed only to prurient
interests and violated community standards in Dade, Broward and Palm
Beach counties.
   Lyrics of many of the songs on the album contain misogynist and
violent references, though they're tempered with humor.
   Navarro said his deputies went to Freeman's store after Freeman
was quoted in news reports as saying he would sell the album despite
the ban.
   ``We could not in good conscience allow him to flagrantly ignore
the court's order,'' Navarro said at a news conference Friday.
   Campbell, owner and president of the group's record label,
Luke's, said the company will help pay the legal fees of people
arrested for selling the album.
   ``Somebody has to stand up and the retailers, I think, should
stand up,'' Campbell said. ``We can give them some of the contacts
we used in our case and we can help them financially.'' Campbell did
not give specifics.
   The Miami-based rap group sued after Navarro, acting on the
ruling of a county judge who said the material was ``probably
obscene,'' sent his deputies in March to warn retailers they faced
arrest.
   Gonzalez said the sheriff's office engaged in prior restraint of
free speech by threatening owners before the recording was ruled
obscene.
   The judge's obscenity ruling has no legal effect outside south
Florida, but civil libertarians see a practical effect spreading
nationally.
   Lisa Penna, who attended the show at the Miami Beach nightclub,
said the controversy surrounding the group is a ``political vehicle
for people trying to get re-elected.''
   Of the group's raps, she said, ``All of this has to be taken in
jest.''

<TEXT>
   Rita Swan knows the pain of losing a child
for deliberate denial of medical attention. Now she is determined
that other parents be prosecuted for making the same decision.
   Work from her home in this tiny northwest Iowa town, Ms. Swan
takes credit for prompting more than two dozen prosecutions against
parents whose children died as they followed religious teachings for
treating illness with prayer.
   Most of the parents are members of Christian Science Church. So,
at one time, was Ms. Swan.
   ``The right of a child to live should be the highest priority of
a civilized society,'' she said.
   ``The Christian Scientists say the death of a child is one of the
great mysteries of the ages, but I say the death is not mysterious
at all. It is the logical and inevitable result of withholding
medical attention.''
   Rita and Doug Swan, a math teacher at a nearby college, formed
the group Children's Health Care is a Legal Duty, or CHILD, in 1983,
six years after their son Matthew died of meningitis at 15 months.
   Ms. Swan, 46, said there are 300 CHILD members in 42 states and
Canada who monitor cases.
   ``In the '80s, 29 sets of prosecutions were filed for
religious-based medical neglect,'' she said. ``That's an amazing
turnaround. In general in the '70s, these children just died and
nobody cared.''
   The results are mixed, with verdicts ranging from acquittal to
conviction on a charge of murder.
   The general counsel for the National Counsel Against Health Fraud
said Ms. Swan singlehandedly has raised the question of medical
neglect with prosecutors across the country.
   ``She puts a bug in their ears,'' said Michael Botts, of Kansas
City, Mo. ``She's the one who deserves the credit. It's her guts
that did it. Without her, nothing would have been done.''
   He said several courts have ruled that parents can be held
accountable for the death of a child, notwithstanding religious
beliefs.
   ``You've got parents playing Abraham out there. They believe if
their religion is strong enough, the child will be saved. It's
nothing short of human sacrifice to prove the strength of religious
convictions,'' he said.
   Other courts have dismissed such actions, however, based on
``religious exemptions'' in state child abuse laws.
   Christian Scientists say healing-by-prayer is usually successful
and protected by guarantees of religious freedom.
   ``We all grieved over her son, but she has now used it to wage a
vendetta against the church,'' said Wendell Deware, a Christian
Scientist practitioner from Davenport.
   A small number of children in the care of Christian Science
practitioners do die, Deware said, but, ``we encounter such
situations so rarely.
   ``The media has concentrated so much on these failures, they will
not take into account the vast majority of successes.''
   The church, founded in 1879 by Mary Baker Eddy, believes that
physical disease, like sin, can be healed by spiritual means alone.
There are about 2,600 Christian Science churches in 68 countries.
   Most states, including Iowa, prohibit the filing of child-abuse
charges against parents who use prayer in treatment of their
children, but prosecutors have filed other charges in several
jurisdictions.
   The Swans, then living in a suburb of Detroit, sued the church
after Matthew died in 1977. The U.S. Supreme Court, without comment,
let stand a lower court ruling that barred the lawsuit on religious
freedom grounds.
   ``He died of meningitis, the common and most treatable form,''
Ms. Swan said. ``He had three terrible fevers about a month apart
preceding this illness. Each time, we called a Christian Scientist
practitioner and he got well. Based on ignorance, we thought the
practitioner had accomplished something significant.''
   A fourth fever claimed the boy's life.
   Ms. Swan said she is ``driven by my sense of duty to our son'' to
seek prosecutions in other cases.
   ``I'm proudest of the prosecutions. I think that's my strongest
weapon against the church. It's not vindictiveness. It's something
that has got to change. I feel our work has almost singlehandedly
turned the country around on this issue to the point where the death
of a Christian Science child will almost certainly get some
scrutiny.''

   Thunderstorms struck parts of the East and Midwest early today.
Clouds shrouded much of the nation.
   Thunderstorms hit New York, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Hail,
heavy rain and damaging winds were expected in New York and Vermont,
but the Appalachian region faced the greatest risk of thunderstorms.
   On Friday, thunderstorms produced high winds, flooding, large
hail and tornadoes in parts of the Plains, the Midwest and along the
southern Atlantic coast.
   A tornado and hail up to 2{ inches in diameter struck near
Emporia, Kan., a day after 21 people were injured by a twister
there. There were no reports of major damage from the latest tornado.
   Tornadoes and thunderstorms produced flooding in Ohio, but there
were no reports Friday of serious damage.
   Hail the size of baseballs pelted Evansville, Ind.
   Thunderstorm winds blew down trees and power lines near York and
Gettysburg in Pennsylvania and in the Virginia cities of Virginia
Beach and Portsmouth. Lightning set many fires across central North
Carolina and in Adams County, Pa., the National Weather Service said.
   Temperatures were in the 80s and 90s across much of the nation
Friday. Greer, S.C., set a record high temperature for the date with
a reading of 96 degrees.
   The high Friday in the Lower 48 states was 111 degrees at Lake
Havasu City, Ariz.

<HEAD>Death Toll Climbs in Central Asia Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll in a week of ethnic fighting between
Uzbeks and Kirghiz in Central Asia has climbed to 102, the Tass news
agency said today.
   Thousands of troops have been sent to the region by the Soviet
Defense Ministry, but the situation in the neighboring republics of
Uzbekistan and Kirghizia remained volatile today, Tass said in a
dispatch from the Kirghizian capital of Frunze.
   Quoting the republic's Interior Ministry, it said 102 people have
been killed and 436 have been wounded since Monday.
   A total of 225 homes, 31 state buildings and 62 cars have been
torched since the violence broke out, Tass said. It said the damage
occurred both in Frunze and in Osh, on the border with Uzbekistan.
   Tass said 68 of those killed were in the Uzgen district, 36 miles
from Osh. Clashes between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks _ both Sunni
Moslems _ began June 2, and the fighting intensified Monday, Soviet
officials said. In dispute is the allocation of plots of land for
housing in the densely populated, poverty-stricken region.
   On Friday, the president of Uzbekistan declared a state of
emergency in border districts in the republic because of what Tass
called ``a sharp aggravation of the situation.''
   A state of emergency also was in effect in the Kirghiz border
city of Osh, where troops patrolled the streets, and in Frunze.
   Uzbek President Islam Karimov, who declared the state of
emergency on his side of the border, sent an urgent telegram to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev Friday warning that the violence
could spark open conflict between the two republics, Tass said.
   ``There is a real danger of the events in the Osh region
degenerating into a conflict between the two republics,'' Karimov
said in the telegram.
   Author Chingiz Aitmatov, who is a member of Gorbachev's advisory
body, the Presidential Council, and two Uzbek writers appealed for
calm over regional television, the Soviet TV newscast ``Vremya''
reported Friday night.
   They asked the population to show ``wisdom and tolerance, and do
everything to stop the tragedy.''
   ``Vremya'' also reported that the presidents of Kirghizia and
Uzbekistan would meet to work out ways to stabilize the situation.
   It said it was unable to provide a report from Andijan, on the
Uzbek side of the border, because its cameraman was beaten and his
equipment smashed.
   The state of emergency was declared Thursday in Frunze after
clashes broke out, cars were destroyed and thousands of people
surrounded Communist Party and government buildings.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told lawmakers in Moscow that
1,500 soldiers, 900 police and Interior Ministry troops and 450
border guards were in Kirghizia to try to quell the fighting.

<HEAD>Traces of Arsenic Found in Former Hostage's System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arsenic was found in freed hostage Frank Reed's
body shortly after his release from 44 months in captivity, hospital
officials said.
   The officials would not comment on how much of the poison was
found in Reed's system nor on the source of the toxin.
   Reed, 57, of Malden, Mass., has been undergoing treatment at the
Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland
since soon after his April 30 release from Lebanon.
   In a statement Friday, the hospital said screening for heavy
metal substances such as arsenic, lead and mercury was normal
procedure for returning hostages and prisoners.
   ``These tests were performed on Mr. Reed's arrival. The initial
test for arsenic was positive. Subsequent tests confirmed this
exposure to arsenic and its elimination to a non-toxic level,'' the
hospital said.
   A base spokesman, Sgt. Dale Warman, said late Friday no further
details were available.
   Bob Woolf, Reed's attorney, said in a telephone interview from
Miami that the former hostage's arsenic levels were abnormally high.
   ``This was beyond what was normal, believe me,'' Woolf said. ``It
was enough to be concerned about.''
   Reed's wife, Fahima, said she believed her husband had been
poisoned by his captors.
   ``What else could it be? The arsenic couldn't get in his body
just like that,'' she said.
   ``I'm outraged that they would have done something like this,''
she said. ``I'm just happy that he's OK, that nothing's been
damaged.''
   Woolf would not comment on the possible source of the arsenic. He
said some of the toxin had been eliminated from Reed's body since he
began medical treatment, but that traces remained.
   ``It's not completely out of his system, but now it's at a
controlled non-toxic level,'' Woolf said.
   Reed had been surprised by the finding, Woolf said.
   ``It was a little shocking and frightening for him,'' Woolf said.
``This was serious and totally unexpected.''
   It is still unclear what effects the poison would have on Reed's
health, Woolf said. The Malden native was gaunt and weak after his
release, and during a Memorial Day visit to his hometown he said he
suffered from severe anemia.
   ``We still don't know what all the ramifications are,'' Woolf
said. ``But he seems to be coming along fine. He's gaining weight
and I'm hopeful he'll be released in a few weeks.''
   Arsenic is used to make insecticides, glass, medicines and
semiconductors. Exposure to high levels of the substance can produce
a burning pain in one's esophagus and stomach, vomiting, diarrhea
and depression. Prolonged exposure can lead to a rapid, feeble pulse
and circulatory collapse.
   Dr. Alan Woolf, director of the Massachusetts Poison Center, said
trace amounts of arsenic could get into a person's system from water
and food, especially seafood.
   ``You or I might have traces of arsenic in our blood after a
heavy seafood dinner,'' the doctor said.
   Reed was director of the private Lebanese International School in
Beirut when he was seized by Islamic extremists in 1986. After his
release he told of being beaten when he tried to escape and of being
chained and blindfolded for months at a time.
   Peggy Say, sister of hostage Terry Anderson, said she was
appalled by the news of the arsenic and worried it could mean other
hostages could also be affected.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was taken hostage March 16, 1985. Reed has said he last saw
Anderson between a year and 18 months ago.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Sexclusiv,'' East Germany's first sex
magazine, hits newsstands today, ushering in a new sexual revolution
after 40 years of restrictions under Communist rule.
   The magazine, devoted to promoting sexual awareness, is backed by
East Germany's German Sex League, the state news agency ADN said.
   Unlike in West Germany, where sex magazines and pornographic
material are readily available, East Germany's former hard-line
Communist government banned such material.
   But with the loosening of restrictions following last fall's
democratic upheaval, the Sex League has set for itself the goal of
promoting new sexual freedom in East Germany.
   On Friday, members of the Sex League gathered in Leipzig, the
heart of the peaceful revolution that toppled the Communist
government last year.
   The first order of business was changing the group's name from
its original German Sex Union, ADN said.
   The group's original name was picked last fall when the
Communists were ousted. But it had the same initials in German as
the conservative German Social Union _ a member of East Germany's
governing coalition.
   ADN said erotic videos were also shown at the meeting. The news
agency did not say how many people attended or how many members the
group claims to have.
   The first edition of ``Sexclusiv'' is priced at six marks
($3.60). The price appeared to be a play on words since the number
six is pronounced ``sex'' in German.

<HEAD>Kill Van Kull Cleanup Could Take Two Months, Tar Balls Hit Beaches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAYONNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tar balls as large as footballs have washed
ashore on two beaches after a grounded tanker spilled 260,000
gallons of heavy crude oil into a commercial waterway in New York
harbor, a Coast Guard official said.
   But neither Coney Island nor Rockaway Beach, on the Atlantic
Ocean within about five miles of the harbor mouth, was expected to
be closed today, said Petty Officer Gary Rives.
   ``It's not a thick coating, it's just some tar balls washing
ashore,'' he said.
   A Coast Guard board of inquiry is to begin hearings Monday on the
grounding of a British-owned tanker carrying home heating oil
Thursday in the Kill Van Kull, a shipping channel between Bayonne
and the Staten Island borough of New York City.
   The panel also will consider other spills this year that have
dumped more than 1 million gallons of oil into the harbor _ four
times the amount spilled last year, the Coast Guard said.
   ``The panel has been called because we do not know if it is bad
luck or a common thread that binds these incidents,'' said Rear Adm.
Gene Henn, who will chair the hearings.
   Meanwhile, about 420 workers and guardsmen on a flotilla of
nearly 80 vessels cleaned the shores and waters of Kill Van Kull.
The cleanup is expected to last at least two months.
   Miles of absorbent boom contained nearly all the oil in the
narrow channel and spared the Shooters Island bird sanctuary, Coast
Guard officials said.
   The Kill Van Kull, which normally handles 200 vessels daily, was
reopened Friday afternoon on a case-by-case basis after remaining
closed for about 36 hours, the Coast Guard said.
   About 9,000 gallons of the industrial fuel has been recovered so
far, said Capt. Robert North, adding that usually only 15 percent to
20 percent of a spill is recaptured. The remainder will either
dissipate or sink, officials said.
   The tanker's first mate, Geoffrey Frederick Gregory, 52, New
Marske, England, faces state charges of operating a vessel while
under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He is also charged with
negligent discharge of a pollutant without a permit.
   He pleaded innocent to the charges at a hearing in Bayonne
Municipal Court on Thursday and was ordered to reappear June 12. He
was released after putting up 10 percent of a $50,000 bond.
   Capt. James Sanial, in charge of a separate Coast Guard
investigation, said Gregory was at his post at the front of the
tanker as the vessel made its way to the dock in Bayonne.
   Florentz described Gregory as a ``spotter'' and said his duties
during the docking operation were to stand on the bow and look for
obstructions.
   However, Gregory's attorney, Richard Regan of Hoboken, said that
was not his client's responsibility. He did not elaborate.

   A national outpouring of gifts, cards and letters
helped a 12-year-old boy survive burns over 55 percent of his body
after a bully allegedly set him on fire, the boy's cousin said.
   David Opont, released Friday from the hospital where he stayed
three months and received six skin grafs, added his own words of
gratitude for his remarkable recovery.
   ``I have to thank God, my doctors and nurses,'' the 12-year-old
said as he faced dozens of television cameras and reporters on the
lawn of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
   But Opont still faces physical therapy and reconstructive
surgery, mostly cosmetic, and counseling for the next three to four
weeks at another hospital, doctors said.
   When asked how he felt, David said in a soft voice: ``Fine.''
   ``The first thing I want to do is go to school,'' he said.
   Standing by were David's mother, father, sister, doctors and
nurses.
   ``The gifts, cards and letters ... all of that contributed to
bringing David back to life,'' said Guito Lavoile, a cousin and
spokesman for the immigrant family from Haiti. David arrived in the
United States in 1988.
   David was given a 50-50 chance of survival after he was attacked
on his way to school March 7. He was visited by Mayor David Dinkins,
entertainer Bill Cosby and former President Reagan, among others, in
a national outpouring of sympathy.
   A bully forced David into a building, tied him to a railing and
set him afire, police said. The same boy allegedly robbed Opont a
day earlier.
   The 13-year-old alleged assailant was arrested hours after the
attack and has been jailed at a juvenile center ever since.
   ``He has accomplished a lot, but he has a long way to go,'' said
Dr. Cleon Goodwin, director of the hospital's burn ward.
   David wore a dark suit with a pink shirt and black bow tie. His
right hand was covered with a glove bandage and he had bald spots on
his head, but he looked fit otherwise. Most of his burns are on his
abdomen, chest and back.
   ``Beneath his nice shirt, he has his compression garments on
which he will have to wear for the next two to three years,''
Goodwin said. The special garments put pressure on the burn scars,
reduce their size and help the color return to normal, he said.
   David was taken in wheelchair to a helicopter that flew him to
the Margaret T. Palomino Rehabilitation Center at Jamaica Hospital.
   At the rehabilitation center, Opont began occupational therapy to
improve the range of his right hand, which was severely burned. He
also had educational games and schoolwork.
   ``His favorite game is Nintendo,'' said Dr. Craig Rosenberg, in
charge of rehabilitation medicine at Jamaica. By playing the home
video game, ``he can work on hand-eye coordination.''
   He also will be counseled on how to deal with the reactions other
children may have to his scars, Rosenberg said.
   ``Kids don't have tact and kids usually don't know what to say.
Kids are honest,'' he said. ``The main focus is ... making sure he
is ready emotionally as well as physically to go back into his home
environment.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Assures Refuseniks Of Her Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KIEV, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
today assured Jewish refuseniks that her support for their right to
emigrate has not been diminished by her anger with Israel over West
Bank settlements.
   On the third day of a four-day visit, Mrs. Thatcher had breakfast
with six refuseniks, or citizens who have been refused permission to
emigrate, before arriving in Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, to
tour a British cultural and trade exhibition.
   Several thousand people pressed against barriers, cheering as the
British leader arrived at the $17 million exhibition. A British
military band played ``Scotland the Brave.''
   Mrs. Thatcher met the refuseniks after sharply criticizing Israel
during a joint news conference Friday with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   She said Israel's policy of letting Soviet Jews settle on the
West Bank was wrong, and added: ``I think it is almost letting down
those of us who have campaigned vigorously'' for Jewish emigration.
   But British officials said that at the breakfast with the
refuseniks, she assured them that Britain's policy was unchanged.
   ``She told them that Britain will continue to support them and
raise their cause,'' said a British official. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   During the news conference Friday, Gorbachev repeated warnings
that he may curb the emigration of Soviet Jews unless Israel stops
the new arrivals from settling on the West Bank.
   Under Gorbachev's liberalized policies, Soviet Jewish emigration
is running at a record level. Israel says some 35,000 Soviet Jews
have arrived this year, but it says it has no policy of settling
them in the occupied territories and that only a few hundred have
settled there.
   The refuseniks who met with Mrs. Thatcher included Jewish
mathematician Mark Kotlyar, an activist in the increasingly restless
nationalist movement, the Ukrainian Popular Front.
   He has been refused permission to leave on grounds that he had
access to classified information when he worked in the Soviet
Ministry of Radio Industry until 1975.
   On Friday, Mrs. Thatcher and Gorbachev set out opposing positions
on the feasibility of an all-European security system to bridge the
opposing military alliances.
   However, both expressed optimism that there will be a solution to
the dispute over Western insistence that a united Germany remain in
NATO.
   ``I am quite sure we can come up with an option,'' Gorbachev said
at a joint news conference after more than four hours of talks.
   The Soviet president, who is beset by mounting domestic troubles,
declined an invitation to travel with Mrs. Thatcher to Kiev.
   After the fall of Communist governments in Moscow's six European
allies, Gorbachev is confronted by the crumbling of the seven-nation
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact as a military alliance.
   The Warsaw Pact said after a summit Thursday that it plans to
become a purely political and ``consultative'' body by November.
   Gorbachev told Friday's news conference he envisions the
formation of a new all-European security system.
   ``We believe there is a chance for the formation of a new type of
relationship between the two alliances as they go through a
transforming process while overcoming military confrontation, or at
least easing military confrontation, in Europe,'' he said.
   Although Mrs. Thatcher acknowledged ``a new spirit'' between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact, she said it was vital to maintain the Western
alliance complete with nuclear weapons and the U.S. troop presence
in Western Europe.
   ``For the time being we should continue to work through the
existing organization,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher envisages the strengthening of the 35-nation
Conference on European Security and Cooperation, which includes
almost all of the European nations.
   She emphasized that NATO is sensitive to Soviet concerns about
German unification and is seeking to find means of reassurance
including, for example, keeping Soviet troops in what is now East
Germany for a transitional period.

   A few spot fires were smoldering today at
a chemical packaging plant that was ripped by a series of
chain-reaction explosions that hurled flames and barrels 300 feet
into the sky.
   Two employees were injured in the fire that erupted late Friday
morning at the Solvents &amp; Chemicals Inc. plant and burned all day.
The explosions apparently were sparked by a punctured barrel that
ignited.
   The area surrounding the plant in an industrial area south of
Houston was ordered evacuated, but few people left and the order was
later lifted. Authorities did not believe toxic fumes were a problem.
   Thick black smoke billowed for several hours and had almost
dissipated by Friday evening, authorities said.
   The plant continued to smolder with heavy smoke early today and
firefighters from several cities were fighting ``a few spot fires''
with foam, said a Pearland fire department dispatcher who refused to
be identified.
   ``It's under control now and we're just watching it and waiting
for it to go out on its own,'' said Susan Jarmon, another dispatcher.
   Company spokesman George Foster said about 40 employees were
safely evacuated from the plant, which has about 50 storage tanks
outside.
   ``Apparently there's a significant loss to the building
structure,'' Foster said. ``But the tanks seem to be intact.''
   The 20-year-old company packages various chemicals for sale to
hardware and grocery stores, including paint and lacquer thinners,
windshield washer products and charcoal starters, said Jordi Baizan,
another company spokesman.
   Police Sgt. Armando Garza said he arrived when several 55-gallon
barrels began exploding. He said he heard about 30 explosions before
he fled.
   ``It was very loud and kind of scary,'' Garza said. ``You see a
55-gallon barrel drum go some 300 feet into the air and you don't
know where it's going to land.''
   Eloy Salazar, 26, was the most seriously injured with second-and
third-degree burns on his chest, face and back.
   ``They were apparently depressurizing some 55-gallon drums and
there was a spark, I believe from a fork lift, and that set off the
fire,'' said Dr. Jeff Britton, who treated Salazar.
   Another employee, 49-year-old Alexander Jacky, was treated for
minor burns to his forearm. Six firefighters and emergency workers
were also treated for heat exhaustion or smoke inhalation.

protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New
York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a
newspaper said today.
   The mayor also asked members of the ``organized Jewish
community'' to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the
visit, the Daily News said.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, will visit
eight cities from June 20 to July 1.
   ``There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in
very, very high esteem taking great umbrage'' at any public protest,
Dinkins said.
   ``I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very
unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and
especially so seen by persons of color,'' Dinkins told the newspaper
in an interview.
   Leaders of several Jewish-American organizations plan to meet
Mandela on Sunday in Geneva. The organizations want the South
African leader to clarify his position on Israel.
   Mandela has embraced Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, in public and has compared the struggle of
Palestinians to that of black South Africans.
   Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his
Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome
in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's ``unbending
anti-Israel stance.''
   City councilman Noach Dear and state assemblyman Dov Hikind said
if Mandela does not make a strong statement in support of Israel,
they would take out ads in newspapers and hold demonstrations.

   Rival Christian forces skirmished with
mortars in east Beirut today, raising fears that a fragile
23-day-old, Vatican-brokered cease-fire could soon collapse.
   Police said no casualties were reported in the early morning
mortar exchanges between troops loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and
the Lebanese Forces militia led by Samir Geagea.
   The cease-fire went into effect May 17, and has halted major
clashes between the rival Christian forces, which have been battling
for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave since Jan. 30.
   But despite the cease-fire, there have been daily firefights
between Aoun's troops and Geagea's militiamen. Police officials said
all-out fighting could resume because mediators have failed to
secure a political settlement.
   ``Nothing has changed at the political level,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under standing
regulations. ``Both sides remain in their positions, and no one can
predict how much longer this cease-fire will hold.''
   By police count, 1,036 people have been killed and 2,772 wounded
in the Aoun-Geagea power struggle.
   The fighting has driven an estimated 400,000 of the enclave's 1
million population to seek refuge in other parts of Lebanon or
abroad.
   The police spokesman said some of the refugees who sought
sanctuary in Moslem west Beirut cross into the eastern Christian
sector of the capital daily to check on their property. But he said
they leave before nightfall because they fear a fresh outbreak of
violence.
   Aoun has rejected October's Arab League-brokered peace accord
aimed at ending Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war because it does not
include a specific timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian
troops from Lebanon. He also has refused to recognize the
Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi's authority and given his cautious
support to the Arab League peace plan.
   In another development, senior officials of rival Shiite Moslem
factions met in an effort to resolve their intermittent 3-year-old
war for mastery of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's
largest sect.
   The meetings between representatives of the Syrian-backed Amal
militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, are
sponsored by Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, head of Syrian military
intelligence in Lebanon, and Iran's Ambassador to Syria, Mohammad
Hassan Akhtari.
   The meetings, which began Friday, were attended by Sheik Abbas
Musawi of the fundamentalist Hezbollah and Mohammed Baydoun of the
mainstream Amal.
   Both Shiite factions said in separate statements that they
welcomed the new effort by Syria and Iran to end the fighting.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed and more than 3,000
wounded in the Shiite fighting in Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily said today that an expanded
meeting between Amal and Hezbollah leaders will be held in Damascus,
the Syrian capital, once Kenaan and Akhtari obtain the agreement of
the rival factions. The newspaper gave no date for such a meeting.

<TEXT>
   Czechs and Slovaks prepared today
to welcome their first freely elected government in more than 40
years, but a controversy between the two most powerful parties
overshadowed the euphoria of free voting.
   Polls opened at dawn today for the second day of balloting, and
were to close at 2 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT). Final results were expected on
Sunday.
   Civic Forum, the loose grouping of intellectuals, students and
dissidents who fueled the revolution seven months ago that ended the
Communist grip on power, was heavily favored along with its Slovak
partner, Public Against Violence.
   The Christian Democratic alliance was expected to be the
runner-up, with only three other parties _ the Communists, the
enviromentalist Greens and the Social Democrats _ projected to do
well enough to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to be represented
in Parliament.
   All the 21 parties contesting the election alongside the
Communists campaigned on a heavily anti-Communist platform.
   Voters were electing a new, two-chamber federal Parliament and
deputies for regional parliaments in the Czech and Slovak republics.
It is the fourth instance of free balloting in formerly Communist
East Europe. East Germany, Hungary and Romania held elections
earlier this year.
   The new, 300-seat Parliament will choose a president, and is
expected to pick President Vaclav Havel, the playwright and former
dissident who led the anti-Communist revolution. Parliament's main
job during its two-year term is to rewrite the constitution.
   The elections remained the main event, but have had to share
space in the media with a dispute between the Civic Forum and the
Christian Democrats.
   At issue are the alleged links of a top Christian Democrat, Josef
Bartoncik, with the despised secret police of the past Communist
regime.
   Bartoncik's People's Party, one of three parties in the Christian
Democratic alliance, filed suit Thursday against a deputy interior
minister and Civic Forum sympathizer, Jan Ruml, who accused
Bartoncik of wrongdoing. The People's Party said Ruml's actions
contravened the election law forbidding any electioneering 48 hours
before the voting.
   Havel backed Ruml Thursday night, and said on Friday that his
fellow former dissident was one of the most honest men he knew.
   Today, Havel's office accused Bartoncik of long years of
collaboration with the feared secret police of the toppled Communist
regime. ``For 17 years, he was a paid adviser of the STB,'' Havel
adviser Jiri Krizan, using the Czechoslovak acronynm for the former
secret police.
   Havel, 53, while remaining immensely popular, has raised the ire
of some of the electorate who accuse him of overtly supporting Civic
Forum _ a stance they consider as violating presidential
impartiality.
   During voting, authorities have banned the sale of alcohol except
beer and posted police at public places, from polling stations to
post offices.
   For young people who have never voted, and older citizens who
thought democracy had vanished in the 1930s with the Nazis and again
in 1948 with the Communist takeover, the balloting has been a dream
come true.
   ``I didn't hope to see free elections again,'' Milena Jirotova,
68, said Friday.
   ``It's a new feeling,'' said Katrina Hauffova, 20. ``I couldn't
imagine anything like this.''

   A teen-age runaway carrying a fake
grenade hijacked a Soviet airliner with 121 people aboard and forced
the pilot to land at an airport near Stockholm early today, police
said.
   No one was hurt in the hijacking, and the 17-year-old Soviet
surrendered to authorities after the plane landed at Arlanda
international airport, 25 miles north of Stockholm, the Swedish
capital, police said.
   According to police statements, the young man said he had decided
to leave the Soviet Union after he was thrown out of his parents'
home. He was identified as Dimitry Semionov of the Belorussian
capital, Minsk.
   Arlanda police inspector Barry Ivarsson said Semionov surrendered
to the police one hour after the landing. ``He just said he wanted
to stay in Sweden,'' Ivarsson said. The inspector said Semionov
would be arraigned later.
   The three-engine Aeroflot plane, a Tupolev 154, was carrying 114
passengers and a seven-member crew from Minsk to Murmansk when it
was hijacked and forced to fly to Arlanda.
   Police searched the plane for explosives but did not find any.
The plane then returned to the Soviet Union.
   The last time a hijacked plane landed at Arlanda was in 1977.
That aircraft also came from the Soviet union.

   Three strong earthquakes killed eight people
and injured 37 overnight and early today in a northern jungle region
that was devastated late last month by a major temblor, authorities
said.
   ``Some houses have fallen down as well as a number of public
buildings,'' a government agency spokesman said while describing the
damage from the three quakes, two of which struck around midnight
and a third at 5 a.m.
   The spokesman for the National Geophysical Institute in Lima
described the temblors as strong, but he did not immediately have a
Richter scale reading.
   The earthquakes struck the villages of Porvenir and Nuevo
Cajamarca and the cities of Rioja and Moyobamba, 400 milesnorth of
Lima.
   The region was hit May 29 by an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the
Richter scale that damaged or destroyed many buildings, killed at
least 56 people and left 800 injured and thousands homeless.
   When the quakes struck late Friday and early today, many people
left homeless by the earlier temblor were sleeping in the streets.

<TEXT>
   Almost overlooked in the Soviet Union's
nationwide tumult, Central Asians are reclaiming their identity,
waging a free-form rebellion against Moscow while warring among
themselves.
   New political movements, led by intellectuals and fed by an
Islamic revival, accuse local authorities of perpetuating Kremlim
control. Poverty and social frustration are sowing violence.
   Vicious communal riots, quelled by shoot-to-kill military
repression, have killed hundreds of people, perhaps more than 1,000,
in the past year. Rampaging youths have torched whole neighborhoods.
   Throughout the region, activists say that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's promise of perestroika eludes Asians who do not want
space in the ``common European home'' he envisions for the future.
   Unlike the northern regions, where Baltic republics bargain for a
separate place in a new Europe, Central Asians pursue a dream of
reviving 1,000-year-old roots stifled by Russian rule.
   Despite 70 years of Soviet overlay, much of the region remains
almost as the silk-caravan drivers found it on their way from China.
Only blocks from Tashkent's grandiose monuments to Soviet saviors,
old men in robes and skullcaps sip tea under mulberry trees.
   Beyond mud walls on winding streets hardly wide enough for a
laden donkey, youths read the Koran and mutter darkly about a
century of Russian imperialism. Increasingly, they are ready to
fight for independence from Moscow, 1,800 miles away.
   ``This is like what happened in Algeria,'' said Igor Krupnik, a
specialist in ethnic conflict at the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
recalling the upheaval that drove France from its North African
colony.
   But unlike in Algeria, he said, bitter divisions among peoples in
the five Central Asia republics add the threat of internal civil
war, pitting Asians against each other as they resist Moscow.
   In Uzbekistan, the third-most populous Soviet republic, and in
Tadzhikistan, to the south along the Afghan border, Russians are
leaving in growing numbers, joining an exodus of ethnic minorities.
   Although some Russians admit to fear of violence, many say they
are leaving before worsening economic and social conditions in
Central Asia trigger a mass departure.
   There is potential for unrest across a vast area approaching a
population of 50 million.
   While fighting in the Caucasus is confined to well-delineated
borders, as in Lebanon, Krupnik said, internal strife among Central
Asian groups could spill across a Soviet southern border stretching
from Iran to China.
   On June 4, violence broke out between Uzbeks and Kirghiz on the
border between their republics, over desperately scarce land. A
skirmish grew to a pitched battle, and scores were killed.
   Like tinder igniting from a small spark, fighting spread to
Frunze, capital of Kirghizia. Uzbeks and Kirghiz, like Kazahks and
Turkmen, share Turkic roots but also a history of conflict.
   Tadzhiks, ethnic Persians, clash sporadically with neighboring
Uzbeks.
   The Soviet policy of clamping down hard acts to intensify
frustration, Asians say.
   In Kazakhstan, the sweep of steppe bridging Russia and Asia,
tension is less evident, but young radicals deride authorities in
Moscow for crushing nationalist stirrings.
   A Kazakh editor of the underground weekly, Turkestan, afraid to
be named for fear of reprisal, said she turned radical when troops
fired on crowds in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, in 1986.
   Kazakhs were protesting the nomination of a Russian as first
secretary of the local Communist Party. It was the first ethnic
violence after Gorbachev took power.
   ``For the outside, Gorbachev is a champion of perestroika,'' she
said. ``For us, he is a hangman.''
   Leaders of popular front movements in three troubled republics
said in interviews that their goal was independence within a few
years, although none wanted to pin down details.
   ``We want independence as soon as possible, but it is too early
to say what that means,'' said Abdurahim Pulatov, chairman of the
unofficial Uzbekistan party, Birlik, a vanguard movement.
   Mohammed Solikh, an Uzbek poet who heads the rival opposition
movement, Erk, echoed Pulatov's remarks.
   Western specialists say Central Asians, although divided among
themselves, share a common purpose: to restore their language,
culture and traditional values.
   ``I am amazed by an overwhelming sentiment to throw the rascals
out,'' said Edward Allworth, a Columbia University professor who has
written widely on Central Asia and was in Tashkent for new research.
   Travel restrictions limit access, but interviews in areas
recently closed to foreigners and under curfew reflect emotions
ranging from vague unease to panic. In the rich Fergana Valley, east
of here, the mood is grim.
   ``They killed like animals,'' said a law student named Nasli, an
ethnic Turk whose family was among many thousands displaced by
Stalin from Meskhetia in southern Georgia generations ago.
   She recalled the Fergana Valley violence a year ago that took 107
lives by official count.
   ``There were at least a thousand dead,'' she said. ``Uzbeks
chopped off children's hands, gouged out eyes, burned people alive.''
   Her family's Tashkent house was burned in new violence last
February, a ripple from bloody assaults in the town of Parkent, 60
miles from here. ``Now I am leaving for good,'' Nasli said.
   Only last month, gangs of young Uzbeks rampaged through the
Fergana town of Andizhan, firebombing the homes of Armenians, Jews
and ethnic Russians. Women were raped, but no one was killed.
Victims said local authorities ignored appeals for help.
   Krupnik called that a new tactic to frighten minorities without
attracting army reprisals. ``These things are very serious.
Authorities respond in the old way, and the situation worsens.''
   In February, thousands of young Tadzhiks sacked Dushanbe in riots
touched off by reports that Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan were
being given scarce housing. Quickly, witnesses said, they turned on
Russians.
   A senior Tadzhik official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said two people were killed by rioters. The rest were shot by army
troops restoring order, heightening resentment against Moscow. The
official put the death toll at twice the official figure of 27.
   In the aftermath, Tadzhik intellectuals rankled at Moscow papers
that emphasized attacks on Russians. The real target, Tadzhiks said,
was the stifling Soviet system.
   ``We have nothing against Russians, and we condemn the
violence,'' said Abdujabor Tohir, head of Rastohez _ or Renaissance
_ the Tadzhik popular front. ``But we want to control our own
lives.''
   Like Pulatov and Solikh in Tashkent, he denied that Islam was
behind the violence. ``It is social frustration,'' he said, noting
that Tadzhikistan's underemployment approached a third of the work
force.
   Opposition leaders say they want to build an economy that allows
youths to find jobs and homes.
   They say that an imposed dependence on cotton has not only hurt
the environment but also has crippled possibilities for economic
viability without Soviet support.
   But, fired with a sense of cultural and natural identity
suppressed since the czars, many activists argue that economics will
follow once the politics are settled.
   ``Old corrupt ways still continue,'' Solikh said. ``We must wake
up the people. As long as we have governments that look to Moscow,
out of touch with the people's needs, we cannot be independent.''

   Volodya Ishenko, a Ukrainian architect,
built a good life in Central Asia: He earns four times the average
Soviet wage, owns a country home and his wife likes her work. But
they are soon to depart.
   ``I'm leaving for two reasons, and the first is an instinct for
self-protection,'' he said.
   The second is economic. He will take a loss at first, Ishenko
figures, but will come out ahead by beating the rush to resettle in
the republic of Russia.
   The tide of Russians and Russian speakers is ebbing from the
troubled reaches of Central Asia, first settled a century ago behind
the heavy guns of the czars.
   Since the 1920s, the region has been part of a seamless Soviet
state. Now, spurred by perestroika and a resurgence of Islamic and
cultural sentiment, Central Asians are demanding their birthright.
   Pressure on outsiders ranges from subtle remarks to bloody
pogroms.
   ``I must admit I hurried up my decision after February,'' Ishenko
said, referring to bloody riots. The issue that set off the violence
was Armenian refugees, but rioters beheaded the statue of a general
who led Russians into Tadzhikistan.
   Demographers have few reliable statistics, but see significant
movement that began slowly about five years ago and recently has
increased sharply.
   ``Many Russians are leaving, and there would be a lot more if
they could find a place to go,'' said Igor Krupnik, a specialist on
ethnic affairs at the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   Figures for Uzbekistan show a net loss of 48,800 Russians during
1988, before pogroms in the Fergana Valley speeded up the pace. A
recent census said Russians made up 11 percent of the republic's 19
million inhabitants.
   In Tadzhikistan, a first wave left after February, abandoning
furniture and even clothing in their haste. Now, departing Russians
are taking the time to examine their options.
   ``I think every Russian in town would leave if they had the
possibility,'' said a ranking professor named Olga, who decided she
could not find anywhere to go with her retired parents.
   Emigrants must not only find jobs, but apartments in a country
where little is for sale and people wait years for housing.
   ``That is all anyone talks about anymore,'' Olga said. ``People
spend their whole vacations scouting for a place to go.''
   Raya Andrejeva, a journalist in Tashkent, decided to go after
fighting for her life on an operating table. In March, while she was
taking out the garbage, two youths asked if she spoke Uzbek. She
said no and was stabbed.
   ``I don't care; I'm going anywhere,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ready for Prime Time: BBC Goes Live with Badgers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With intensive coverage worthy of a summit meeting,
badgers proved themselves quite ready for prime time on British
television.
   For three nights last week, ``Badger Night'' on BBC-2 showed
badgers scratching, snorting, scuffling and stalking the wily
English earthworm.
   ``We're so close to them,'' cooed Jessica Holm, doing the
play-by-play from a tiny booth near the badger den.
   ``Grgarogaraow!'' said a badger standing nearby.
   A crew from BBC Bristol set up a month ago on land owned by
badger expert Don Hunford, who had been watching this group of
badgers since 1957. The BBC would only say the badgers were in Essex
county, northeast of London.
   The animals are Britain's largest mammal, and have many friends
among Britons, who grew up with tales of Mr. Toad and Mr. Badger in
``The Wind in the Willows.''
   Chris Skinner, the official county badger recorder, said 800
badgers dens were counted in Essex in 1960. Now, a third are gone
and only half of the remainder are occupied, she said.
   The Nature Conservancy Council's latest count found 43,000 badger
dens in Britain with 250,000 animals in all, main anchor Sally
Magnusson said.
   Ms. Skinner said the badgers are losing the competition with
people for land, and are killed by hunters and by farmers who regard
them as pests.
   On tape, ``Badger Night'' accompanied 14-year-old Beverly Burton
of Staffordshire to a badger baiting pit, where sportsmen wager on
how long it will take their dogs to kill a badger.
   ``The men would pull the claws and the teeth out, they'd break
the back leg and sometimes poke the eyes in, so the badger had no
defense at all,'' Miss Burton said.
   On Thursday night's segment, a villain appeared in the large,
hearty form of gamekeeper Ray Walker.
   Badgers kill lambs, he said. Eat right through the rib cage.
``You certainly wouldn't want badgers on your land in the numbers
they are here,'' Walker said.
   Well, Ms. Magnusson asked Tony Crittenden of the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, what about it?
   ``Couldn't you stand accused of sentimentality? Couldn't we all,
in fact, here as we watch and ooh and aah at our little friends
playing down there, that what we're talking about is an oversize
weasel that's a pest?''
   ``Absolute nonsense!'' Crittenden retorted.
   However, the image of the cuddly badger savaging woolly lambs had
clearly stung.
   ``Badgers very rarely kill lambs,'' said Stephen Harris, a badger
specialist from Bristol University.
   ``Can you honestly imagine badgers like these going out and
killing lambs?'' said Ms. Holm, a zoologist who specializes in
squirrels.
   ``It doesn't make sense to me, Jessica,'' said Hunford, who
added: ``They are not hunters. They would make a hopeless mess if
they tried...''
   Cut to the House of Commons, where Ms. Holm earlier interviewed
the badger's friend in Parliament, Tony Banks of the opposition
Labor Party.
   Banks is sponsoring a bill to require fox hunters to stop badger
holes with soft earth before a hunt, rather than concrete and rocks.
   ``It seems silly to me to protect the animal and not the animal's
home,'' Banks said. ``At the moment, people can dig for foxes, can
dig if their dog has gone down, or if their granny accidentally
stumbled down there.''
   If anyone suspected a certain pro-badger slant in the series, Ms.
Magnusson came clean on Friday night.
   ``It would be (dis)ingenuous of us to pretend that these three
programs of ours haven't been partisan,'' she said.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the nation's 10
provincial premiers tried today to conclude a constitutional
agreement that would prevent French-speaking Quebec from pulling out
of Canada.
   It was the seventh straight day that the ``first ministers,'' as
they are called here, met privately in Ottawa's conference center to
win the required unanimous agreement on the Meech Lake accord.
   A tired, baggy-eyed Mulroney announced early this morning after a
marathon session that Canada is ``whole again,'' saying lawyers were
working to finalize an agreement.
   Meech Lake must be approved by the legislatures of all 10
provinces by June 23 or the 1987 accord, which recognizes
French-speaking Quebec as a ``distinct society,'' is dead. The
accord is named after the Meech Lake government retreat near Ottawa,
where it was originally worked out.
   ``It's important to national unity that we get this debate behind
us,'' New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna told reporters as he
returned to the conference hall late this morning.
   ``I believe it's critical that we get Meech Lake off the agenda.
I don't believe that Canadians ever, ever want to hear about Meech
Lake again.''
   ``These things are never really final until they're all signed,
sealed and delivered,'' Mulroney said. ``There remains some
important work to be done.''
   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' British Columbia Premier
Bill Vander Zalm said. But Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said he
was displeased by a preliminary text prepared by lawyers shortly
after midnight, and wants it clarified before a deal is formally
signed. He seemed the lone holdout.
   Many of the 6.7 million citizens of Quebec have said the province
should reconsider its place in the Canadian federation if the Meech
Lake accord were rejected by any of the provinces.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa disrupted the talks Thursday when
he warned he would no longer discuss any changes in the clause
declaring the French province a ``distinct society'' _ the heart of
the accord.
   ``This is fundamental to Quebecois,'' Bourassa said as he arrived
at the conference center in Ottawa Friday. ``Their first choice is
to stay within Canada and be recognized as a distinct society.''
   Newfoundland and Manitoba remained holdouts to approving the
accord Friday, against the wishes of Mulroney. However, Manitoba
political leaders said late Friday they were pleased with a federal
proposal offered earlier in the day to break the deadlock.
   In a 1980 referendum, Quebecois rejected a proposal to open talks
with the federal government on a plan allowing Quebec political
autonomy.
   Despite that vote, the province refused to sign the 1982 Canadian
constitution, saying Quebec's French character had been ignored.
   In 1987, the 10 premiers and Mulroney signed the five-point Meech
Lake accord as a constitutional amendment to appease Quebec. They
gave themselves three years to win ratification.
   Since then, elections brought new governments to Newfoundland,
Manitoba and New Brunswick and the new premiers reneged on the
signatures of their predecessors.
   Now, polls show nationalist sentiment is on the rise in Quebec
and a growing number of Quebecois are again ready to break away from
Canada either totally or in some sort of autonomy arrangement with
Ottawa.
   During this week's talks, New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna
said his concerns had been addressed and he would support the accord.
   Canada has 25 million residents, one-fourth of them in Quebec.
Most of Canada's population lives within 100 miles of the U.S.
border.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari have decided to open negotiations to reach a
U.S.-Mexican free trade agreement, according to administration
officials.
   Bush and Salinas will meet Sunday night, laying the groundwork
for a formal announcement of their decision by the White House on
Monday.
   Completion of a free trade agreement could take years but, if
successful, it would bring all of North America _ 335 million people
_ into a single market free of tariffs and most non-tariff barriers.
   Mexico would join the free trade zone established between the
United States and Canada two years ago.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, said preparatory
discussions among experts from the two sides will begin shortly with
an eye toward getting formal negotiations under way by the time of
the next Bush-Salinas meeting in December in Monterrey.
   The two presidents will dine at the White House on Sunday night
without aides. Secretary of State James A. Baker III will meet with
Salinas on Monday morning.
   Salinas, who will address a gathering of business executives
Monday evening, is making his visit at a time of unusual harmony in
Mexican-American relations.
   During the 1980s, disagreements over Central America produced
deep cross-border hostility.
   The only significant setback recently was the U.S.-orchestrated
kidnaping in April of a Mexican doctor wanted in the 1985 murder of
a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Mexico.
   Administration officials have consistently praised Salinas for
what they regard as his courage in confronting Mexico's acute drug
smuggling problem and in attempting to reverse eight years of
economic decline.
   In recent years, Mexico has moved decisively to modernize its
economy, selling off hundreds of resource-draining state enterprises
and joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The latter
move has led to significant trade liberalization.
   Two-way U.S.-Mexican trade totals about $52 billion but experts
consider this figure to be far below the potential.
   Salinas, who took office in December 1988, initially was cool to
the idea of a free trade pact but since has become a strong
proponent.
   After the Mexican Senate gave Salinas the green light last month
to seek an FTA with the United States, he said, ``Mexico will not be
left out of the new world configuration. The speed of the changes
requires decisive answers on all fronts, in all markets.''
   Many Mexicans have been concerned that the United States, with
its more developed economy, would overwhelm Mexico under an FTA. But
those fears have gradually abated, and much of the remaining
opposition is confined to Mexican labor unions.
   A recent report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
tank, said a U.S.-Mexican FTA would offer the ``best hope for Mexico
to join the ranks of the world's prosperous countries.''
   Many Mexican products currently are denied access to U.S.
markets, including steel, textiles and some agricultural goods.
   As the Heritage study points out, a more prosperous Mexico would
reduce the incentive for many Mexicans to emigrate illegally to the
United States.
   Compared with the United States, Mexico's own market is far more
protectionist, and most economists believe this has contributed to
the country's economic difficulties.
   An FTA would be a boon to many U.S. exporters. If it also
substantially liberalized U.S. investment opportunities in Mexico,
the result would far more business activity, from which both
countries would benefit, the officials said.

   Firefighters and soldiers on Saturday put
out a forest fire that devastated about 2,500 acres of brushland and
pine trees near this southeastern city.
   Francisco Lopez, the regional environment chief, described the
blaze as one of the region's worst in four decades.
   About 300 area residents joined firefighters and an army unit in
the 12-hour battle to put out the blaze. Two hydroplanes were used
to scoop water from the Mediterranean and dump it on the fire, Lopez
said.
   No one was hurt and villages in the area, 45 miles north of this
regional capital, were not evacuated, he said.
   Authorities blamed arsonists for the fire, which started at three
different sites in the hot, dry Sierra Larga mountain range, Lopez
said.
   Rough terrain and high winds hampered firefighters' efforts.

<HEAD>Assault Weapons Campaign Idled as War of Words Erupts in Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-month campaign to curb semiautomatic
assault weapons is suddenly on hold as Senate Republicans and
Democrats trade shots over who scuttled an omnibus anti-crime bill.
   Democrats blamed Republicans and hard-nosed lobbying by the
National Rifle Association for derailing the bill. Republicans say
they want to resume debate and offered a compromise to get the bill
back on the Senate floor.
   But Democratic Leader George Mitchell made it clear he was in no
rush to resume debate after failing twice in a week to break a
filibuster on the bill.
   ``There's no deadline,'' Mitchell said last week as talks aimed
at reaching a compromise got under way.
   That brought Republican leader Bob Dole to the floor to declare
that he was ready with a compromise. ``I urge the Democrats to
accept our good faith breakthrough on the crime front.''
   But Mitchell said ``the Republicans killed the crime bill'' by
voting in large numbers against cutting short debate. He said GOP
lawmakers now were clamoring for more action because ``they are
obviously concerned about'' the political fallout of not getting a
crime bill passed.
   Sen. Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
says the chances are ``better than even'' that the Senate will pass
a crime bill this year. But the House is not at work on similar
legislation.
   The Senate bill would bar the import from overseas or manufacture
in this country of nine semiautomatic assault weapons. It would
provide the death penalty for 30 federal offenses and has provisions
to shorten delays in carrying out executions.
   In addition, the nation's money laundering laws would be refined
slightly under the measure.
   The campaign to curb assault weapons began in January 1989 after
a deranged man with an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle opened fire on a
Stockton, Calif., school yard, leaving five dead and 30 injured.
   Mitchell halted floor action last week after twice failing to get
the Senate to limit debate to nearly 30 hours. He said some 300
proposed amendments were awaiting action and added that trying to
debate all of them would merely fuel a filibuster.
   The Senate on Tuesday voted 54-37 in favor of limiting debate,
six short of the number of votes needed. On Thursday it voted 57-37
in favor of such a move, three votes short.
   The first time around, 31 of those voting against a time limit
were Republicans, while six were Democrats.
   On Thursday, 30 Republicans and seven Democrats were against
limiting debate.
   Besides blaming Republicans, a number of Democrats pointed the
finger at the NRA, which sent out sharply worded mail to gun owners
saying supporters of the assault weapons provision ``betrayed every
law-abiding gun owner in'' the state.
   ``The major reason is the NRA,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
declared. ``They are extremely effective in getting their people
out.''
   ``They have distorted things beyond belief,'' he added. ``We for
example in our office have received literally thousands of
communications from the NRA side and one or two percent of that from
the other side.''
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., urged national drug policy director
William Bennett to ``fight the efforts of the National Rifle
Association to stall a desperately needed crime bill.''
   But the gun group was clearly not the only factor, since some
Senate liberals such as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., an
outspoken critic of capital punishment, also voted against cutting
short a filibuster.
   And Republicans denied that they were bowing to the NRA in voting
in large numbers against a time limit. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
who is retiring and thus not vulnerable to re-election pressure,
said his problem was with ``habeas corpus'' provisions of the bill.
   The provisions would overhaul the system under which criminal
cases are reviewed to determine if defendants were treated in a
constitutional manner. Repeated appeals under the system have caused
delays of a decade or more in carrying out executions.
   Meanwhile, both sides tried to whittle down the number of
amendments to be offered from 300 in total to 12 for each party
under terms of a compromise proposal offered by Republicans.
   Dole said that posed little problem and offered to get right to
work.
   ``There will be no legislative games allowed,'' he declared.
   Mitchell, however, said he wanted to see the specifics of the
amendments that the Republicans would offer if the measure were
brought back to the floor. ``Then we can consider whether we want to
accept it or make some modification,'' he said.
   Besides agreeing to push on in search of an agreement, the two
sides agreed tentatively to drop two provisions of the bill.
   One would have allowed courts to consider evidence gathered with
flawed search warrants, provided that police acted in good faith in
executing the warrants.
   The provision was little different from what the Supreme Court
has already allowed.
   Republicans had wanted to permit warrantless searches, a red flag
to Senate liberals who say it would fly in the face of the
Constitution.
   The other provision dropped would have set up an independent
organized crime and drug division within the Justice Department.

   Japan's birthrate has hit an all-time low and the
population as a whole is aging faster than expected, the Health and
Welfare Ministry said in a report released Saturday.
   The coming of Japan's ``aged society'' _ the point at which
people aged 65 years or over outnumber those under 15 _ might take
place before the year 2000, said the annual report. Previously, this
had been predicted to occur in 2004.
   According to the report, Japan's birthrate fell to 10.2 births
per 1,000 people last year, the lowest rate since the government
began taking population statistics in 1899.
   The number of babies born in 1989 also fell to a 90-year low,
down 67,000 births from 1988 to 1,246,000, said the report, which
was quoted in most major newspapers.
   It also said 4,400 fewer Japanese died in 1989 than the year
before. Cancer, heart disease and stroke caused 62 percent of the
788,000 deaths.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh plans to meet
Monday with top officials in Scotland about the continuing
investigation into the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie.
   From Scotland, Thornburgh will travel to Sweden for further
discussions about the investigation, then on to Italy and Ireland
for conferences and meetings on terrorism and other aspects of
international law enforcement.
   Thornburgh leaves Sunday for the six-day trip.
   The New York-bound Pan Am flight blew up over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
   Investigators have concluded that the bomb causing the crash was
hidden in a suitcase that was placed aboard a Pan Am Flight
originating in Frankfurt, West Germany. The suitcase was transferred
in London to the New York-bound plane.
   Law enforcement authorities believe the bomb was planted by
members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
General Command.
   Officials in Sweden said last year that a Palestinian on trial in
that country had admitted obtaining a bomb from a shop used by
members of the Popular Front.
   Thornburgh will confer Tuesday in Stockholm with Swedish
authorities.
   During his meetings, Thornburgh will ``express appreciation for
cooperation in the Pan Am investigation and encourage further
cooperation and access to witnesses as the United States builds its
criminal case,'' Eramian said.
   Thornburgh will then travel to Italy for discussions on Wednesday
with Italian law enforcement officials about narcotics, organized
crime and terrorism.
   The attorney general is scheduled to attend a two-day conference
in Ireland on Thursday and Friday of the TREVI group, an
anti-terrorism organization of Western European law enforcement
officials.

<TEXT>
   President Samuel K. Doe of Liberia, his capital
under siege by rebel soldiers, has retained a Washington lobbyist
for $800,000 to represent his interests in the United States.
   Doe hired van Kloberg and Associates starting June 1, as fierce
fighting with the rebels sent a flotilla of U.S. Navy ships to
evacuate thousands of Americans, their dependents and other
foreigners from Liberia. Hundreds of Americans are being flown out
of the West African nation this weekend on chartered planes.
   The firm's owner, Edward van Kloberg, flew to the Liberian
capital of Monrovia a week ago to finalize the deal, a spokesman
said last week. The contract, filed with the Justice Department's
office of foreign lobbyists, is for $800,000 over a 19-month period.
   ``Doe doesn't need public relations right now, obviously,'' said
Mike Hogan, a spokesman for the lobbyist. But Liberia's embassy in
Washington has been shut down since the fighting intensified in
recent weeks, and Doe needed someone to represent him here, Hogan
said.
   Doe has been widely accused of mismanaging the Liberian economy,
and his troubles have been compounded in recent months by mass
desertions from his army and by tribal divisions.
   The effort to topple Doe, a former army sergeant who seized power
10 years ago in a bloody coup, began Dec. 24 when a band of rebels
infiltrated from neighboring Ivory Coast. The insurgents, some of
them trained in Libya, are led by a former high-ranking Liberian
official, Charles Taylor.
   The Liberian government said Friday it was willing to accept a
cease-fire and begin negotiations with the rebel army.
   U.S. officials have urged Doe to negotiate with Taylor, but at
the same time they also have been quietly asking several African
governments whether they would agree to grant Doe asylum.
   Hogan said his firm's attempts to begin a dialogue with a
representative of Taylor in New York have not been successful so
far. The State Department also has been trying to bring the sides to
some accommodation.
   Doe's brother has been living here for over a year and he, too,
has been representing Liberia in discussions with the State
Department and other officials, Hogan said.
   ``Without U.S.-supported mediation, Liberia appears destined to
sink even deeper into ethnic turmoil, resulting in thousands more
deaths,'' said a statement from van Kloberg's office on Friday.
   The release also noted that Taylor had escaped in 1985 from an
American jail where he was waiting to be extradited to Liberia on
charges of embezzling $1 million. It reiterated Doe's promise of
last week _ made to appease the advancing rebel troops _ that he
would hold free elections next year and would not run.
   Van Kloberg, a former administrative dean at American University,
has several African clients, among them Niger, Burkina Faso and
Zaire.
   He has also represented Romania and Iraq.
   Liberia was founded by descendants of freed U.S. slaves in 1822,
and it became black Africa's first independent country in 1847. It
serves as a center for U.S. military communications and a relay
station for Voice of America broadcasts to Africa.
   The rebels are holding large parts of the country, which is about
the size of Ohio, and have reached 25 miles southwest of Monrovia.

<TEXT>
   A feature film on the 1987 bombing of a
South Korean airliner by alleged North Korean agents opened to the
public here Saturday and some criticized it as propaganda.
   Others, however, praised the South Korean-made film, titled
``Virgin Terrorist'' in English, as an artistic achievement.
   The film drew about 1,500 people to first-day showings in the
capital, publicists said. Earlier, about 1,200 people, including
half a dozen Cabinet ministers, attended a by-invitation premiere.
   The documentary-style film features a self-confessed North Korean
female agent who, along with a male companion, bombed a South Korean
plane near Burma, killing all 115 people on board.
   The woman, Kim Hyun-hui, 27, said she blew up the plane on orders
from North Korean leaders to scare foreign athletes and officials
away from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. North Korea denied involvement.
   The film's Korean title is ``Mayumi,'' the false name used by the
woman.
   Ms. Kim said she and her male companion, traveling on forged
Japanese passports, planted a time bomb on the plane before getting
off at a stop in Abu Dhabi. The plane disappeared near Burma's
Andaman Sea.
   The scene of the plane being blown up in flight _ which
reportedly cost $1 million to stage _ is graphic. It shows bodies
being ripped apart and falling from the aircraft in flames and smoke.
   Ms. Kim and her companion were stopped by airport officials after
traveling on to Bahrain. Upon being apprehended, they both swallowed
cyanide. The man died but she survived and was later extradited to
Seoul.
   Ms. Kim was found guilty of the bombing and sentenced to death.
The Seoul government pardoned her in April, however, saying that she
had been duped by North Korea.
   ``This is an anti-terror movie which bespeaks our national
tragedy, the division of the peninsula, of which I myself am a
direct victim,'' said the film's director, Shin Sang-ok.
   Shin, 62, and his actress wife, Choi Eun-hee, said they were
abducted to North Korea while visiting Hong Kong in 1978. They
defected to the West through Vienna in 1985 and moved to the United
States.
   Shin denied that the South Korean government asked him to make
the movie. But critics said there was evidence of government
assistance and cooperation.
   Lee Woo-ho, a leader of the Moonhwa Broadcasting Co., the
nation's second-largest television network, said his union will
fight to block a contract to show the film, which he called a
``cheap anti-Communist movie.''
   Kim So-ra, a 24-year-old Seoul college student, played the lead
role. she said she was chosen because of physical resemblance to Ms.
Kim.

<HEAD>Robbery Suspects Arrested In Killing Of U.S. Marine Blamed On
Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said Saturday that
two robbery suspects have confessed to killing a U.S. Marine officer
who police originally thought was slain by Communist rebels.
   Recent rebel killings of American servicemen and threats of more
attacks have prompted U.S. military officials to scale down a
military exercise this month, restrict travel and even offer to ship
military families home free of charge.
   Authorities picked up Wilfredo Corpuz, 20, and Rosauro Otian, 25,
on Wednesday for questioning in a series of robberies near the
U.S.-run Subic Naval Base, said Lt. Col. Leonides Soberano, acting
Philippine military and police district commander.
   The base is about 30 miles southwest of San Fernando and about 50
miles west of Manila.
   During interrogation, Corpuz confessed to several robberies,
including a May 4 holdup that led to the killing of U.S. Marine
Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette, Soberano said. Corpuz named Otian as his
accomplice, Soberano said.
   He said both suspects had signed confessions linking them to
Fredette's killing and that charges would be filed.
   Police originally suspected communist rebels in the killing, but
the guerrillas never claimed responsibility.
   The Communist New People's Army, which has waged a 21-year-old
guerrilla war, claimed responsibility for the May 13 killing of two
U.S. airmen near Clark Air Base but has remained silent on the
killing of Fredette.
   On May 2, another U.S. serviceman was stabbed to death at his
home near Subic in another apparent robbery attempt.
   Four other U.S. servicemen and civilians have been killed since
April 1989, and authorities say those slayings were politically
motivated and carried out by suspected communists.
   The rebels have said the killings won't stop unless the six
U.S.-run military bases in the country are dismantled.
   A total of 40,000 Americans _ servicemen, civilian workers and
dependents _ are stationed at the bases.

   East Germany's defense minister has predicted
the breakup of the Warsaw Pact's military structures this year, a
newspaper said Saturday.
   The statement from Rainer Eppelmann is one of the most radical to
date from a member of the Soviet-led military alliance.
   During a meeting in Moscow on Thursday, the seven-nation Warsaw
Pact issued a declaration designed to reduce Moscow's influence over
the alliance. The pact also announced it would turn itself into an
alliance of sovereign and equal states.
   In other developments Saturday:
   _ Experts from the United States, the Soviet Union, France and
Britain met in East Berlin with their counterparts from the two
German states. Delegates from the six nations are preparing the
second round of top-level German unification talks, scheduled for
June 22 in the East German capital.
   _ East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere flew to the
United States, where he will meet with President Bush. De Maiziere
is the first East German government chief to visit the United States.
   _ West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned from a visit to the
United States, where he expressed confidence that international
talks on German unification could be wrapped up by fall.
   Those talks have stalemated over the question of the military
posture of a united Germany, but Western leaders are hoping for a
change in the Kremlin's stance against NATO membership for the new
nation.
   At the same time, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact faces massive
changes now that the countries that once unfailingly followed the
Soviet line are showing greater independence.
   East German defense minister Eppelmann, in an interview with West
Berlin's Morgenpost daily newspaper, painted an extremely bleak
picture for the Warsaw Pact.
   ``In this year, the complete military structures of the Warsaw
Pact will be abolished, including the joint supreme command,'' the
newspaper quoted Eppelmann as saying.
   The Morgenpost quoted him as saying he ``just could not imagine''
the armies of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland or Hungary
marching westward toward NATO countries.
   Eppelmann reportedly told the paper there was ``tacit
understanding'' East Germany would leave the Soviet-led alliance
upon unification with West Germany, although the subject was not
discussed during the Moscow meeting.
   The state-run East German news agency, ADN, carried Eppelmann's
comments.

<HEAD>Furor Follows Proposal To Fight AIDS By Legalizing Brothels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former health minister has called for the
legalization of brothels to help fight AIDS, and a poll made public
Saturday suggested most French people think it's a good idea.
   Condemnations have come from across the political spectrum,
including women's rights advocates who say lifting the 44-year ban
on brothels would amount to state-sanctioned slavery.
   But a Louis Harris poll indicated strong public support for the
suggestion by the former health minister, Michele Barzach, one of
the few women with a high profile in French national politics.
   Of the 1,008 people surveyed, 80 percent said reopening brothels
would help control AIDS by allowing closer medical supervision of
prostitutes, according to the poll.
   According to unofficial estimates, France has 75,000 to 90,000
full- or part-time prostitutes.
   About 10,500 cases of AIDS have been recorded in France since
1982.
   Ms. Barzach, a 46-year-old gynecologist, was health minister from
1986 to 1988 in the conservative government of Premier Jacques
Chirac, and many of her policies stirred controversy.
   During her tenure, she helped launch campaigns to reduce tobacco
and alcohol consumption, denounced surrogate motherhood, cut back on
state-paid medical benefits and led a campaign against AIDS that
included scrapping a ban on condom advertisements.
   The current furor was set off by an interview published Thursday
in the newspaper Le Monde, in which Ms. Barzach discussed the AIDS
threat.
   ``The current situation is unacceptable and frightening,'' she
said. ``It's necessary to reopen the licensed brothels. Let's
install a genuine health system.''
   Licensed brothels were shut down on April 13, 1946, under the
``Marthe Richard law,'' named for its legislative sponsor, a World
War I spy and World War II resistance member.
   Ms. Barzach now is a deputy to Chirac, mayor of Paris. He took
pains Friday to say the brothel proposal was only her personal
opinion _ not a position of their Rally for the Republic party.
   Within the ranks of the governing Socialists, reactions varied
from cautious to caustic.
   Michele Andre, secretary of state for women's rights, said she
was ``deeply offended'' by the proposal to ``lock up women and use
them as merchandise.''
   Health Minster Claude Evin said the problem of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome extended far beyond prostitutes and homosexuals,
but added: ``I am ready to consider anything that would help stop
the spread of AIDS.''
   French police officials in the past have expressed support for
relegalizing brothels, but they made no formal endorsement of Ms.
Barzach's suggestion.

   Arthur Stull's every labored breath
reminds him of the silica dust he inhaled 60 years ago while working
on the Hawks Nest Tunnel.
   Historians say up to 700 men, most of them black, died of
silicosis and other lung problems after working on the aqueduct,
bored through a deposit of nearly pure silica in Gauley Mountain.
   Other men, like Stull, survived but still are suffering decades
later from the effects of silica dust.
   ``There was no protection from it,'' said the 78-year-old Stull,
who lives in nearby Mount Lookout. ``Work was scarce then. You
couldn't find work anywhere, hardly. You had to take what you could
get.''
   Work on the 3.8-mile aqueduct, about 40 miles east of Charleston,
began 60 years ago this week. Born in the bleak days of the Great
Depression, the project proved to be one of the darkest moments of
U.S. industrial history.
   The tunnel was built by Union Carbide Corp. through a contractor,
Rinehart and Dennis Construction Co. of Charlottesville, Va. The
purpose: divert the New River to a power station used at a Union
Carbide smelting plant in nearby Alloy.
   Martin Cherniack, a Yale University assistant professor of
occupational medicine, studied the case and wrote ``The Hawks Nest
Incident'' in 1986.
   Crews blasted a 31-foot-wide tunnel through almost pure silica, a
glassy substance found in sand and quartz. Then, the tunnel's width
was nearly doubled to cash in on the silica, so pure it could be
used without refining at the alloy plant, according to Cherniack.
The whole project took about two years.
   Soon after work began, many workers began complaining of hacking
coughs and searing chest pains. The average worker stayed on the job
just 15 to 16 weeks, Cherniack said.
   A company doctor at the time called the condition ``tunnelitis,''
and gave the men tablets nicknamed ``little black devils.''
   Many didn't quit in time. An undertaker was paid $55 each to
remove and bury bodies in a mass grave near Summersville.
Congressional records say 169 men eventually were buried there.
   But with jobs hard to find, reports that workers were dying
failed to deter others. Men who died or fell sick and refused to go
back to work in the tunnel were easily replaced.
   The number who died while working on the tunnel or died later of
lung diseases is only a guess because many of the more than 4,000
workers were migrants and left the area. Estimates range up to 700.
   Lengthy exposure to silica causes hard nodules to form in lungs
until scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, leaving little room to
breathe. Tuberculosis and pneumonia often develop.
   The hazards of silica dust were known to civil and mining
engineers in the 1930s, although company officials later claimed
they did not know of the dangers.
   Cherniack concluded that racism was a factor in the deaths. More
than 75 percent of the workers were black migrants who came from
across the South.
   He wrote of ``a widespread attitude of condescension, if not
contempt, toward the blacks.'' Many whites believed that the workers
were dying not because of silica dust but because of poor nutrition
or a propensity to violence.
   ``In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, some people still
say that knifings, shootings, and beatings took the greatest toll,''
Cherniack wrote. ``Gambling out of doors before open fires in the
cold is another supposed cause of death.''
   About 300 survivors and relatives filed lawsuits against Rinehart
and Dennis. They eventually received $130,000, half of which went to
lawyers. Rinehart and Dennis, now defunct, admitted no wrongdoing.
   A 1936 House Labor Committee investigation into the deaths
brought unwelcome notoriety to Gauley Bridge. It became known as
``The Town of the Living Dead'' because of the many disabled workers
who remained there until they died.
   Townspeople resented outside interest in the tragedy. Researchers
had difficulty finding cooperative sources and sometimes were
threatened, Cherniack said.
   And in an unrelated dispute, federal authorities contended in a
lawsuit that Union Carbide should have sought federal permission
before diverting a navigable waterway. The U.S. Supreme Court
eventually decided in favor of the government in that dispute.
   The tunnel is now owned by Elkem Metals Co. of Pittsburgh, which
bought it, along with the power plant and alloy factory, from Union
Carbide in 1980.
   Stull said he was lucky because he apparently was assigned to a
part of the tunnel with the least amount of silica.
   Nevertheless, he said, the dust led to pneumonia and surgery to
remove part of his lung shortly after he stopped working on the
tunnel. Doctors blame the silica dust for his current lung problems.
   Besides the dust, tunnel workers coped with gas from vehicles
that carried the rock and steel from the tunnel, he recalled.
   ``Some days the light would get awful red looking,'' Stull said.
``You could tell there was gas. ... We just went ahead and worked.
You just got used to it and didn't pay much attention.''

<HEAD>White Supremacist vs. Black in Arkansas; SC Dems Pick Nominee for
Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A white supremacist battles a black businessman in an Arkansas
runoff Tuesday for the Republican nomination for lieutenant
governor. In South Carolina, two state senators compete for the
Democratic nomination to challenge popular GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   In North Dakota, voters will decide whether to raise the sales
tax for a year to bail out education, and to oust Labor Commissioner
Byron Knutson, who is accused of mismanagement. His two challengers
are an old friend and a rival not yet old enough to take office.
   And in Maine, a continuing game of political musical chairs
enters a new round with primaries in both parties for the 1st
District congressional seat held by Democratic Rep. Joseph E.
Brennan.
   Brennan served as governor until 1986, when, in effect, he
swapped jobs with Republican John E. McKernan. Now Brennan wants his
old job back and will run against McKernan, who incidentally is
married to the state's other U.S. representative, Olympia Snowe.
   The Democratic front-runner in a five-way race for Brennan's seat
is Attorney General James E. Tierney, who was the unsuccessful
Democratic nominee for governor in 1986. In the two-man Republican
runoff, the leading candidate is David F. Emery, who held the seat
for eight years before he unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Sen. George
J. Mitchell in 1982.
   In Arkansas, Ralph Forbes, a minister and former American Nazi
leader, won 46 percent of the vote in last month's three-way primary
for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor.
   Because he fell short of a majority, he was forced into a runoff
with the second-place finisher, Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris, the
manager of a realty company who was a defensive back on Arkansas
Razorbacks football teams.
   Forbes argues that ``racial separation is ultimately the right
answer'' and cites the Bible in support of his views.
   Arkansas Republicans, including gubernatorial nominee Sheffield
Nelson, were embarrassed by Forbes' strong showing and quickly
disavowed him and endorsed Harris, who is black.
   ``This election should be decided by the people from the bottom
up, not the party bosses from the top down,'' Forbes said Friday.
   The GOP lieutenant governor's race had attracted little attention
before the primary in the heavily Democratic state. Some in Arkansas
attributed Forbes' big vote to his name having been first on the
ballot.
   The winner of the runoff will face Jim Guy Tucker, an
ex-congressman who won a seven-way Democratic primary.
   In South Carolina, state Sens. Ernest Passailaigue and Theo
Mitchell are vying for the right to take on Campbell, who is only
the second Republican governor in the state this century.
   ``I'll be a citizen's politician, not a career politician,''
Passailaigue says, referring to Campbell's six years in the General
Assembly and eight years in the U.S. House before becoming governor.
   Mitchell, who is hoping to become the state's first black
governor, calls Campbell ``the worst governor of South Carolina in
the 20th century.'' He said Campbell ``catered to the wealthy and
privileged at the expense of the working people, the poor people,
the retired and elderly.''
   In Atlantic City, N.J., Mayor James L. Usry and challenger Jim
Whelan will ask voters to decide who can best ease the city's
problems of poverty, filth and crime.
   Usry, the city's first black mayor and a former school
administrator, faces the extra obstacle of a pending political
corruption indictment.
   Whelan, a white city councilman and swimming instructor, has
avoided bringing up the indictment. His campaign seeks to portray
him as the candidate who can appeal to blacks and whites in the city
of 35,400.
   North Dakota's initiative measure would push the sales tax up
from 5 percent to 6 percent for a year, raising an estimated $42
million. Most of that would go to elementary and secondary
education, making up for drastic cuts in the education budget
imposed after voters rejected a series of tax increases last
December.
   Knutson, 60, is seeking his second four-year term in the
low-profile office that acts as a go-between in wage disputes
between workers and their bosses. The office has seven workers,
including Knutson, whose annual salary is $49,300.
   He insists his office has done a good job despite separate
investigations by the state auditor and attorney general, both of
which concluded Knutson was slow and sloppy in handling wage
disputes.
   His opponents are Republican Craig Hagen, 24, a political
newcomer who will not become old enough to serve until after the
primary, and S.F. ``Buckshot'' Hoffner, 66, executive director of
the state Centennial Commission. Hoffner won the endorsement of the
Democratic Party over Knutson.
   The top two vote-getters in the primary will meet in the November
general election.

<HEAD>Narcotics, Trade, Cambodia Major Issues for Thai Prime Minister in
Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
travels to Washington Monday, expecting to hear criticism of
lackluster efforts fight drug trafficking and the failure to stop
the piracy of U.S. copyrights, patents and trademarks.
   Although still staunch allies, relations have been frayed in
recent years by issues ranging from Washington's subsidies for
American rice farmers to moves by American cigarette companies to
penetrate the closed Thai market.
   But on major global and foreign policy issues, including the
conflict in Cambodia, the two countries are normally in close
agreement.
   Chatichai is to meet with President Bush at the White House
Thursday, near the end of his U.S. visit.
   The Thai leader is expected to explain his country's recent
initiatives to end the 11-year-old war in neighboring Cambodia.
Thailand and the United States back a three-party guerrilla
coalition fighting the Vietnamese-supported government in Phnom Penh.
   The Thais have tried to get the four warring factions to agree to
a cease-fire but at a conference in Tokyo last week, the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas refused to sign the pact and fighting continues.
   Narcotics is expected to head the agenda, since massive amounts
of heroin flow through Thailand to the United States from the
so-called ``Golden Triangle'' of Southeast Asia.
   Earlier this year a U.S. assistant secretary of state, Melvin
Levitsky, said corruption in Thailand was a major obstacle to
fighting drugs in Southeast Asia. Other U.S. officials have alleged
that narcotics-related corruption infects the highest levels of the
military, government and business.
   In July 1989 the United States issued a warrant for the arrest of
Maj. Gen. Vech Petborom, an assistant police inspector, on charges
of being part of a ring smuggling drugs into the United States. The
Thais have yet to take final action in the case but it appears Vech
will not be criminally prosecuted in Thailand.
   Last March a warrant on similar charges was issued for Chang-Chi
Fu, the so-called opium warlord of the Golden Triangle, the lawless
border area of Burma, Laos and Thailand. Although he operates from
Burmese territory, the powerful trafficker is known to have a
network of legal and illicit operations in Thailand.
   The Thais have a small core of dedicated anti-narcotics officers
and have done a laudable job in stopping the production of opium _
from which heroin is refined _ on their own territory through crop
substitution programs.
   But Thailand remains the main transit country for heroin from
Burma and Laos, where the opium harvests this year are expected by
the U.S. State Department to total 2,600 tons. U.S. officials say at
least 40 percent to 50 percent of the heroin imported into the
United States originates in the triangle.
   In recent weeks, local newspapers have reported that Chatichai
may offer to step up the war against drugs in exchange for American
leniency on trade and intellectual property issues. Washintgon has
threatened to further penalize Thailand under U.S. trade laws if
greater action isn't taken to stop the piracy of American
copyrights, patents and trademarks.
   Thailand is regarded as one of the worst offenders in Asia.
Unlicensed copies of Hollywood videotapes, Walt Disney clothing
lines, American computer software and other products are openly sold
in Thailand. American pharmaceutical products are similarly pirated.
   Six U.S. senators last week criticized the ``seeming lack of
commitment'' by the Thai government.
   ``American businessmen are losing scores of millions of dollars
per year because Thai laws to prevent piracy are inadequate and are
not enforced,'' said a letter from the senators addressed to the
Thai ambassador in Washington.
   Thailand is already on the U.S. trade representative's ``priority
watch list'' for its failure to protect intellectual property
rights, and last year Washington began to deny duty-free benefits
for about $165 million of Thai imports.
   The issue is regarded as a serious one in Thailand because the
United States is the country's most important export market. Last
year, the Thais enjoyed a $1.4 billion trade surplus on exports to
the United States.
   The 68-year-old Chatichai has been an army general, diplomat,
successful businessman and veteran politician holding numerous
Cabinet posts in past governments. Although a generally popular and
democratically elected figure, Chatichai's government has been
accused by opposition parties of massive corruption.

   As polarized Southern Baptists converge for
their annual convention, a church historian said the ``Grand
Compromise'' that has held the denomination together for 145 years
is falling apart.
   ``It's amazing that the denomination has lasted as long as it did
intact, considering its heritage of individualism and diversity,''
said Bill J. Leonard, a professor at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   ``Denominationalists have been masters at maintaining the
balance'' despite repeated attempts through the years to upset it
ever since the denomination was founded in 1845, he said in a
telphone interview.
   Since then, the broad compact that affirmed classic Christian
beliefs while allowing varied interpretations has held together.
   But now with the diffusion of Southern culture and steps by the
controlling fundamentalist wing to ``draw narrower lines of
thought,'' the old inclusive coalition is crumbling, he said.
   About 35,000 ``messengers'' from churches across the country were
expected for the convention opening Tuesday in the Louisiana
Superdome, preceded by rival pastors' conferences running through
Monday.
   Leonard foresaw no abrupt denominational breakup, regardless of
how the voting turns out between fundamentalist and moderate
factions. But he predicted spreading fragmentation of the
14.9-million-member denomination, the nation's largest Protestant
body.
   Leonard details his analysis in a book, ``God's Last and Only
Hope: The Fragmentation of the Southern Baptist Convention.''
   It offers the most comprehensive treatment yet of a conflict that
began in 1979 when fundamentalists launched a drive to purge the
denomination of ``liberal'' tendencies and personnel.
   That faction, which insists on a literalistic view of the Bible
and various right-wing social positions, has dominated annual
conventions for 11 years, gradually achieving majorities of trustees
of denominational agencies and seminaries.
   The fight centers on election of the denomination's president,
who indirectly controls selection of trustees.
   Fudamentalists are backing the Rev. Morris Chapman, pastor of
First Baptist Church of Wichita Falls, Texas. Moderates support the
Rev. Daniel Vestal, pastor of Dunwoody Baptist Church in suburban
Atlanta.
   In his book, Leonard, the 44-year-old head of the faculty
organization at the denomination's oldest, flagship seminary in
Louisville, calls the struggle ``The Controversy.''
   It has ``polarized almost ever segment of convention life,''
Leonard writes, with fundamentalists denounced as ``totalitarians''
and ``hit men'' and moderates condemned as ``skunks'' and
``termites'' undermining right belief.
   Noting that virtually all Southern Baptists are theological
conservatives, affirming biblical authority, Leonard says
fundamentalists seek a ``particular doctrinal uniformity, grounded
primarily in the dogma of biblical inerrancy.''
   That theory holds that the Bible is without error about history,
science, religion and all other matters.
   Many moderates also hold a fundamentalist view of Scripture, as
do both presidential candidates, but Leonard points out moderates
oppose efforts ``to impose such dogmas on the entire denomination.''
   In the past, occasional doctrinal disputes passed because a
prevailing Southern culture held diverse views together, Leonard
writes.
   That unity was ``grounded in the Grand Compromise in which
ideologues on the right or left were not allowed to control the
center'' he says, adding:
   ``The denomination became a means of uniting those of various
regional theological and liturgical traditions and holding at bay
those who sought to impose a narrower doctrinal or ecclesiastical
norms on the entire body.''
   Despite recurrent, temporary disputes, he says the denomination
became ``one of the most most organized, efficient, numerically
successful ecclesiastical bodies in North America.''
   But with the fading of the distinctive Southern identity that for
so long held the denomination together, Leonard says the new drive
for conformity in belief has shattered the old coaliton.
   Fundamentalists ``sought to establish a more explicitly
theological identity for the denomination and insure conformity
...,'' Leonard writes. ``Those who do not accept their formulas and
definitions are excluded from representation on convention boards of
trustees.
   ``Their efforts have narrowed the theological parameters of the
SBC considerably and upset the delicate balance that the
denomination had so long struggled, with amazing success, to
maintain.''
   Unlike past disputes, he says, ``only the current controversy has
featured an attempt to appoint people of a single ideological
persuasion to convention boards and agencies. Until now, convention
appointments reflected a wide diversity of perspectives.''
   He says moderates continue to believe the pendulum will swing
back to the conservative center, while fundamentalists believe they
can maintain the ``old denominational triumphalism and success'' and
control the old ``coalition after having destroyed it.''
   ``Unity seems impossible but separation seems unthinkable,'' he
concludes. ``Intrigue and inertia triumph. Southern Baptists
approach the 21st century having squandered much of their spiritual
vitality and their considerable resources on a controvery in which
they turned in on themselves rather than confront a complex world.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three temblors shook an area in the northern
jungle that was devastated by an earlier earthquake, killing eight
people and injuring 37, authorities said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, in Peru's southern Andes mountains, the Sabancaya
volcano continued to belch smoke and gas and spew ashes and rocks
over a six-mile radius, ruining crops and forcing hundreds of people
from their homes.
   Two of the earthquakes struck about midnight Friday and another
hit near dawn on Saturday, said a spokesman for the National
Geophysical Institute in Lima.
   The institute said it did not have a reading on the intensity of
the tremors.
   An earthquake in the region on May 29 measured 6.3 on the Richter
scale and killed at least 56 people, wounded 800 and left thousands
homeless.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by a quake as
recorded by a seismograph, and a temblor measuring 6 can cause
severe damage.
   The quake zone is in an agricultural area about 400 miles north
of Lima, the capital. It includes the villages of Soritor, Porvenir
and Nuevo Cajamarca and the cities of Rioja and Moyobamba.
   Hardest hit in the earlier earthquake was Soritor, where at least
23 people died. The town, six miles south of Moyobamba, was almost
destroyed.
   More than 70 aftershocks were registered in the days after the
initial quake, all with epicenters around the Rioja area.
   Many people in the earthquake zone are still without shelter and
are sleeping in the streets.
   Scientists were monitoring activity at the Sabancaya volcano,
which began rumbling and spitting ash on June 3. Hundreds of farmers
and villagers have since moved off the mountain to safe areas.
   The 21,000-foot volcano is 430 miles southeast of Lima and 50
miles northwest of Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city. Scientists
said an eruption would not endanger Arequipa, which has a population
of 700,000.

   Justice Harry A. Blackmun says he is one of the
Supreme Court's ``three old goats'' whose inevitable departure will
solidify conservative domination of the court for the next 40 or 50
years.
   Labeled a conservative when he joined the court two decades ago,
Blackmun now is an outspoken critic of the court's rightward shift.
He demonstrated his candor during an interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``Last year the cluster of five (conservative members) emerged,
and certainly this year they have control of the court completely,
and are making the most of it,'' Blackmun said.
   He listed Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron
R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy
as members of the court's conservative majority.
   ``I had a feeling until last year that, while they could have had
control of the court, they didn't really seize it,'' the 81-year-old
justice said.
   ``I suppose as long as I am not a member of that group it is
difficult. But we shouldn't resent it,'' he said. ``That's the way
the system works. That pendulum swings. It will stay this way now 40
or 50 years, I'm sure.''
   Blackmun, who Saturday marked his 20th anniversary as a justice,
predicts the court will grow more conservative after the departure
of its three octogenarians _ himself and Justices William J.
Brennan, 84, and Thurgood Marshall, 81.
   None of the three has indicated he is considering retirement.
   Brennan and Marshall are the court's most liberal members, often
joined in the most divisive cases by Blackmun and Justice John Paul
Stevens, 70.
   ``Time will take its toll on the three old goats,'' Blackmun
said. ``We will be replaced by appointees of the current
administration or the next one, which is probably going to be
another Bush administration. So it seems to me that before too long
the court could be nine conservatives, and that surely will last
well into the next century.''
   When appointed by President Nixon, Blackmun had the reputation of
a politically and judicially conservative federal appeals court
judge from Minnesota.
   Early in his high court tenure, he was ridiculed for his
perceived dependence on then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, an old
friend. Even after Blackmun wrote the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion he was considered a dependable
conservative vote.
   By 1980, however, he had emerged as an independent force on the
court. In the past decade, he increasingly sided with the liberal
wing.
   ``I don't believe I've changed in fundamental outlook,'' Blackmun
said. ``If one goes back and reads my opinions on the court of
appeals, you'll find that they are not rock-ribbed conservatism of
the type that seems to be popular today.''
   As a lower court judge, Blackmun said he and his colleagues
``always had the comfort of knowing that if we're wrong, those nine
jokers down in Washington will straighten us out. Here, it's the end
of the line. When one gets here, he has to develop an in-depth
judicial philosophy.''
   He added: ``One has to develop his attitude toward the
(Constitution's) great phrases. What does `equal protection' mean?
What is `cruel and unusual punishment'? I would hope that I have
grown in that respect over the years. But as far as shifting from
conservatism to liberalism, I don't believe I have done that.''
   On the bench, Blackmun most often displays a judicial scowl and
can be snappish with lawyers. Off the bench, warmth and humor
emerge. The justice turns downright effusive when discussing his
three daughters and grandchildren or swapping baseball gossip.
   He is less willing to discuss the possibility of retirement.
   ``I think one has to have good health in this job. I don't
believe one can keep up without it, and I am very conscious of the
fact that some former colleagues of mine who were my age are long
gone,'' Blackmun said.
   After noting that he undergoes a complete physical exam at the
Mayo Clinic each year, Blackmun smiled and said, ``There are two or
three out there who promise they will let me know when my level of
senility reaches the unacceptable point.''
   Blackmun has suffered from recurring cancer of the prostate
gland. Most recently, he was treated for it in 1987. No further
problems have been reported.
   Blackmun realizes his role in court history will be defined
largely by his writing the Roe vs. Wade decision. ``Author of the
abortion decision,'' he once said. ``We all pick up tags. I'll carry
this one to my grave.''
   He has remained an ardent defender of a woman's right to end her
pregnancy and last year dissented bitterly from a decision that gave
states more power to regulate abortion.
   But Blackmun said he hopes other aspects of his tenure will not
be eclipsed. ``I hope I would be remembered as a person of judicial
integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one
field,'' he told the AP.
   ``I'd like to be known just as a good worker in the vineyard who
held his own and contributed generally to the advancement of the
law.''

   Sen. Dave Durenberger's finances go under a
public microscope Tuesday as the Senate Ethics Committee holds its
first hearings in nine years on whether a lawmaker abused his office.
   The committee scheduled two grueling weeks of trial-like
proceedings that could have enormous political consequences for the
Minnesota Republican, whose term runs through 1994.
   There would be ``pressure on him'' to quit if the committee found
serious wrongdoing, Minnesota Republican Chairman Robert Weinholzer
said in an interview. That would allow Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich
to appoint a Democrat to the seat.
   The Ethics Committee has found ``substantial credible evidence''
that Durenberger broke Senate rules or federal law in transactions
involving his former Minneapolis condominium and a book promotion
deal.
   Free limousine rides for personal trips, accepted from groups
interested in legislation, also may have been improper, the
committee said.
   Durenberger, 55, has remained silent about the case in recent
weeks. But last December he apologized to Minnesotans for ``mistakes
and lapses in judgment.''
   Durenberger said he never intended to circumvent Senate rules.
Nonetheless, a Minneapolis Star Tribune poll in March found 79
percent of those surveyed thought Durenberger should resign if found
to have committed ethics violations.
   The newspaper reported Saturday that the Senate committee on
Friday presented a subpoena to Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Tom
Borman about Durenberger loans from the Commercial State Bank of St.
Paul.
   In February, the newspaper reported that Durenberger received
nearly $1 million in loans from the bank during the past decade. No
collateral was required for 21 loans during that period and six were
offered at unusually low interest rates.
   Durenberger and bank officers have denied any impropriety.
   The loan issue would not be raised at the Senate hearings unless
the committee specifically made the matter part of its
``investigation,'' a term that defines the final stage of an ethics
probe. The committee first would have to find ``substantial credible
evidence'' that wrongdoing occurred.
   Many facts in the case are not in dispute. Committee Chairman
Howell T. Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman Warren B. Rudman,
R-N.H., said Durenberger's motivations could play a major role in
determining guilt or innocence.
   Following the hearings, the panel of three Republicans and three
Democrats will decide whether Durenberger broke the Senate's rules
or federal law. If so, punishment ranging from a mild rebuke to
expulsion could be recommended to the Senate. Findings of
lawbreaking would be referred to federal agencies.
   At the hearings, Washington lawyer Robert S. Bennett, hired by
the committee, will serve as prosecutor. Jim Hamilton, a former
counsel to the Senate Watergate committee, will represent
Durenberger. Neither is a stranger to the Ethics Committee.
   Bennett played the role of prosecutor in 1981 in the case of
former Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., when the committee
last held trial-like proceedings to determine ethical wrongdoing.
   The committee began its investigation after Williams already had
been convicted in federal court on nine bribery and conspiracy
counts in the Abscam political corruption scandal. Bennett
recommended expulsion and the full Senate was about to oust Williams
in March 1982 when he resigned.
   Hamilton represented former Sen. Herman E. Talmadge, D-Ga.,
before the committee in a 1979 financial misconduct case. The
committee found wrongdoing and urged the Senate to denounce
Talmadge, which it did.
   There has been intense interest in the Durenberger case in
Minnesota where the proceedings will be broadcast live on public
radio stations and will receive heavy, taped television coverage.
   Weinholzer said if the hearings are ``not too damaging,''
Durenberger ``has plenty of time to regain the trust of the people.''
   If the hearings ``go very badly,'' Weinholzer added, ``his
effectiveness as a senator would be diminished'' and pressure on him
to resign could grow.
   Democrats in Minnesota and in Washington have declined to exploit
Durenberger's troubles. ``It's between the senator and his
colleagues at this point,'' said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Durenberger's friends in the Senate are defending him.
   ``You would have a lot of congressmen and senators who would fail
to shine under the microscope,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,
chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``I don't
think we're looking at a scenario that would lead to his forced
resignation.''
   The committee has filed charges against Durenberger on two
separate occasions.
   On May 14, the committee told him it would examine ``certain
transactions involving a condominium in Minneapolis'' that
Durenberger partly owned, ``as well as your receipt of Senate
reimbursements for using the condominium'' between August 1983 and
mid-November 1989.
   ``The investigation will examine whether you may have abused your
United States Senate office, and misused ... Senate funds through a
pattern of improper conduct which brings discredit upon the United
States Senate,'' the committee said.
   On March 1, the panel informed Durenberger it would investigate a
book deal in which the senator earned $100,000 in 1985-86 for
promoting two books he wrote on defense and health issues.

<TEXT>
   A tanker with more than 38 million
gallons of crude oil on board was rocked by explosions and fire off
the Gulf coast early today, killing at least two crew members,
officials said.
   A small oil slick was reported near the 853-foot Norwegian tanker
Mega Borg but the U.S. Coast Guard said there was apparently no
damage to the cargo hold. But as the fire continued to burn, there
were still fears that the ship could be damaged enough to trigger a
larger spill.
   ``The fire is still out of control and the Coast Guard has rated
it as a `medium-probability-potential major spill,''' Coast Guard
Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Leveille said late this morning.
   The Coast Guard said the tanker was burning 57 miles southeast of
Galveston after an explosion in the engine room about 1 a.m. A
200-foot section at the rear of the ship was still burning out of
control hours later.
   The tanker had transferred 70,000 barrels of its 980,000 barrels
of crude oil to the Italian tanker Framura when an explosion ripped
through the Borg's engine room, Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene said at
a news conference in Galveston. The remainder, 910,000 barrels,
translates into 38.22 million gallons.
   Of the crew of about 40, two were dead, two were missing and
presumed dead and the others were evacuated, the Coast Guard said.
Some of the evacuees were injured but none seriously.
   Shortly before noon, flames could be seen shooting hundreds of
feet into the air as thick, black smoke curled from the ship's aft
section. Two fire boats sprayed jets of water on the flames, and two
Coast Guard cutters stood by. The smoke could be seen 40 miles away.
   The tanker did not appear to be listing.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Leveille said a ``very, very
little'' amount of oil had spilled out of the top of the tanks and
into the Gulf as the fire heated the oil and it expanded. The spill
is not due to a leak in the ship's tanks, he said.
   ``Our greatest concern is that the fire ... is going to cause
structural damage to the bulkhead between the pump room and the
cargo tanks,'' Leveille said. ``If that were to happen, we'd have
the potential for a fairly large spill. We don't believe that is
going to happen.''
   Greene said authorities' immediate fear is that the fire might
spread to three cargo tanks nearest the engine room that hold a
total of 360,000 barrels or roughly 15 million gallons of the light
crude.
   But, Greene said, the possibility of the tanker sinking was
slight.
   ``We don't know what caused the spark or the fire or whatever,
but there were explosions and while our helicopters were on the
scene they witnessed another explosion _ so it's a pretty hot
fire,'' Petty Officer George Wilson said earlier in Houston.
   Ensign Larry Meredith of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office
in Galveston said the spilled oil should not threaten any beaches on
the Gulf of Mexico. But the Marine Safety Office is monitoring the
situation and would expedite cleanup efforts if the situation
suddenly changed.
   ``We don't expect any of the oil to reach the Texas coast,''
Meredith siad. ``It will mix with natural ocean water and _ if
nature takes its course _ evaporate. Being 50, 60 miles off the
coast, we just expect it to evaporate.''
   Hawes said the tanker carries a Norwegian flag. The Mega Borg was
coming from Palanca, Angola, and its next port of call, after
Galveston, was scheduled to be Aruba.
   The Mega Borg's captain and first mate escaped and are aboard the
Coast Guard Cutter Cushing.
   The other surviving crew members were being taken to Freeport
aboard the commercial vessel Patricia M. Some of them were injured,
but none critically, said Shoul. The most serious injury is a broken
leg and others are suffering from bruised ribs or smoke inhalation,
he said.
   The tanker is owned by K.S. MegaBorg II of Farsund, Norway; its
U.S. agent is Biehl and Co. of Galveston.

   Heavy rains forced the temporary evacuation
of up to 10,000 people today, including 2,000 living near a man-made
lake whose retaining wall was in danger of collapse, authorities
said.
   But by midday the weather was improving and officials said most
residents would be able to return home later today.
   Gov. Richard Celeste visited Buckeye Lake after declaring Licking
County in a state of emergency because of flooding and the threat of
collapse of the wall that partially surrounds the lake. He said he
would ask President Bush to declare Licking County a disaster area.
   ``If that wall goes, that whole area is going to be underwater,''
Randy Spiker, deputy director of the Licking County disaster
services agency, said earlier today.
   The evacuations in Licking County began shortly before dawn. The
National Weather Service said 2 to 4 inches of rain fell overnight
in central and north central Ohio.
   About 50 Ohio National Guard troops helped volunteers reinforce
the wall with sandbags and assisted with evacuations of about 2,000
residents of Buckeye Lake, about 30 miles east of Columbus.
   The state has been battered by heavy rains since Thursday.
Weather service forecasters said rainfall could total 6 inches in
some areas. Many areas were so soaked that any additional rainfall
was sure to cause localized flooding, the weather service said.
   Because of the prospect of flooding at Buckeye Lake, 12 miles of
Interstate 70 were closed for a short time this morning, said
Beverly Schell, dispatcher at the Granville post of the state
highway patrol. She said some exits remained blocked to all but
emergency traffic.
   This morning, there were three small leaks in the earthen wall
that partially surrounds Buckeye Lake. While the fear that they
would grow into larger leaks had ebbed by midday, the situation
would still be monitored, authorities said.
   Edward L. Frank, who manages the lake for the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, said, ``If we had gotten the amount of water we
expected around 3 a.m., life in these parts would have changed
radically.'' But Frank said he believed the lake would maintain its
present level and the wall would withstand the pressure.
   The 3,400-acre Buckeye Lake covers parts of three central Ohio
counties. It was created in the 19th century to hold water for the
Ohio Canal.
   About 2,000 residents of the town of Buckeye Lake were evacuated.
In addition, flooding forced the evacuation of about 3,000 people in
south Newark living near the Licking River and campers at a
racetrack, authorities said. Spiker said as many as 5,000 other
county residents may have been displaced temporarily, while others
had been asked be on standby for possible evacuation orders.
   Several evacuation centers were set up around the county.
   Celeste declared a state of emergency, activating the Ohio
National Guard and summoning equipment from the Ohio Department of
Transportation, said Stacie Gilg, public information officer for the
Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
   Tornados and thunderstorms sparked localized flooding around
Ohio. There were no reports of major damage, but a Wayne County man
was missing and feared drowned after falling from a dam.
   The Friday night storms followed a round of heavy rain that
caused urban and small-stream flooding early in the morning and
knocked out power to thousands of customers.
   Buckeye Lake covers parts of three central Ohio counties and is a
man-made lake created in the 19th century to hold water for the Ohio
Canal.

<HEAD>Time Eases Bitterness in von Bulow Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five years after a jury found Claus von
Bulow innocent of trying to murder his heiress wife, Martha
``Sunny'' von Bulow, his ex-wife remains in a coma and his
stepdaughter still believes he's guilty.
   But Annie-Laurie Isham says she is not bitter and adds: ``You go
on to cope with life.''
   The case fascinated the public and national television carried
the verdict live on June 10, 1985, when von Bulow was acquitted at
his second trial. Three years earlier, he had been found guilty.
   The second ruling ``was an unbelievable conclusion to a few
nightmarish years,'' for Ms. Isham.
   Mrs. von Bulow, 59, is at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New
York City in a coma that doctors say is irreversible.
   Von Bulow was accused of attempting to murder her by injecting
her with insulin in December 1979 and again in December 1980. She
recovered from the first coma but went into a permanent coma a year
later. Defense attorneys argued that Mrs. von Bulow brought on the
comas herself through alcohol and drug abuse.
   Millions of people debated the merits of the evidence, and
speculation continues. Even today, ``a lot of people are
unconvinced'' of von Bulow's innocence, said Alan Dershowitz, the
Harvard law professor who masterminded von Bulow's successful
appeal. Von Bulow did not return calls left on an answering machine
at his London home.
   A movie starring Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons and Ron Silver is
likely to add to the controversy and return the von Bulow case to
the limelight with its release this fall.
   ``It leaves much for the audience to infer,'' said Dershowitz,
who wrote the book, ``Reversal of Fortune,'' on which the movie is
based. Dershowitz's son, Elon, is a co-producer.
   Ms. Isham, 32, who called the film a ``commercialization of a
tragedy,'' said time has helped heal her grief.
   ``You don't always walk around with a horrible load on your
back,'' she said in a recent telephone interview from New York.
   ``You miss the people that you've lost and then you go on,'' she
said. ``It's like others who have lost a parent.''
   But Ms. Isham and her 31-year-old brother, Alexander von
Auersperg, were not always so benevolent.
   After von Bulow's acquittal they filed a $56 million civil suit,
alleging the Danish socialite tried to kill their mother to inherit
her money.
   It was settled out of court in 1987. Von Bulow, now 63, agreed to
divorce his wife and renounce all claims to her fortune, including
the $120,000-a-year trust fund created for him before she lapsed
into a coma on Dec. 27, 1980. His share of her estate was estimated
at $25 million.
   He also agreed to give up any rights to book or movie deals about
the family infighting.
   In exchange, the von Bulows' daughter, Cosima, was restored as
full heiress to one-third of her maternal grandmother's $100 million
Pittsburg utilities fortune. The 23-year-old had been cut out of
Annie-Laurie Aitken's will for siding with her father in the family
feud.
   Relations between the siblings remain strained, but time has
helped there, too. Ms. von Bulow attended her half sister's wedding
last summer, said Maureen Connelly, a von Auersperg spokeswoman.
   As a result of the trials, Ms. Isham and her brother set up the
National Victims Center. The Texas-based organization serves
violent-crime victims and their relatives.
   ``We really found that coming out of the trial, particularly from
personal experience, we found out how victims are treated in the
judicial process,'' Ms. Isham said.
   Ms. Isham, whose father, Prince Alfred ``Alfie'' von Auersperg,
is in a coma as a result of a 1983 car accident, also set up the
Sunny von Bulow Coma and Head Trauma Research Foundation, a
non-profit research and education organization.
   ``The last 10 years have been absolute misery and ... in the
beginning the reasons to go into these things were personal,'' she
said. ``But it really goes on to take a life of its own. I can no
longer say the reason I do it is personal.''
   As for von Bulow?
   ``Claus von Bulow will be forever remembered for this case,''
said Dershowitz. ``He was an obscure man before and he'd like to be
an obscure man now. The trial changed his life drastically.''

<HEAD>Dachau Survivors Gather To Remember Nazi Camp Horrors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BRIVE-LA-GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ About 300 survivors of the Nazi
concentration camp at Dachau reunited Saturday, remembering the joys
of liberation by U.S. troops 45 years ago and the horrors that went
before.
   Participants said the gathering in this south-central town was
the largest such reunion ever and the first to which Eastern
Europeans were free to attend.
   ``If we must force ourselves to forgive, we do not have the right
to forget, or to let others forget,'' said retired Gen. Andre
Delpech, 65, a French Resistance fighter tortured by the Gestapo in
1943 and sent to Dachau, five miles north of Munich, West Germany.
   ``As long as there are living witnesses, they have the duty to
testify, so future generations will know. That's why we're here,''
he said during the reunion at the Edmond Michelet Center.
   The center is a resistance museum named after a Dachau survivor
and resistance leader who had lived in this town 300 miles southwest
of Paris.
   Jacques Songy, 66, recalled the day the camp's 30,000 prisoners
were freed by young hearty American soldiers on April 29, 1945. Tens
of thousands of other prisoners did not live to see the day.
   The troops wept and vomited as they discovered naked corpses
piled 10 feet high, the stench of burning bodies, skeletal survivors
ravaged by hunger, disease and Nazi doctors' sadistic experiments,
Songy said.
   ``I was able to make my way out of the infirmary when suddenly I
saw a soldier take off his helmet _ there was this beautiful head of
long blond hair. It was such a shock to see a woman,'' he said.
   Songy later learned the woman was American photojournalist
Margaret Bourke White, whose pictures of Dachau were seen around the
world.
   ``I was so ashamed to be seen in such a state of physical
deterioration,'' said Songy, who at the time was 23 and had
shriveled to only 65 pounds.
   Built in March 1933, Dachau was the first of hundreds of Nazi
concentration camps that housed ``racial enemies of the state.''
Inmates at Dachau included Jews, Communists, clergymen and other
opponents of the Nazi regime.
   Nazi records say nearly 32,000 prisoners died there, but
thousands of other deaths were not registered. The records say
altogether 206,000 prisoners were kept at Dachau, although the
actual number is believed to be much higher.
   Although Dachau had showers equipped as gas chambers, historians
say it was not the site of mass exterminations like Auschwitz and
Treblinka. An estimated 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis.
   Many prisoners at Dachau worked until they died from exhaustion,
malnourishment, beatings, torture and harassament, disease and cold.
   Pierre Schillio _ at 13 the youngest French prisoner at Dachau _
remembers his father urging fellow inmates not to exert themselves,
even if meant an extra ration of dried bread.
   ``So many didn't listen to him. They lost their strength and
died,'' Schillio, 60, said in an emotional interview.
   Escape was virtually impossible. Dachau was surrounded by thick
concrete walls, electrified barbed wire and deep moats. Watchtowers
were manned round the clock. Those caught were hanged.
   The highlight of the weekend reunion was an exhibition of
memorabilia from Dachau, including documents and photographs, many
never before displayed in France.
   The show has drawn more than 2,000 visitors, mostly young people,
since it opened 10 days ago.
   ``No matter how much you read about the camps, there's a shock
when you see the pictures,'' said Natalie, a 15-year-old girl from
the town. ``You can't believe human beings could do this to other
human beings.''
   Several Eastern Europeans, enjoying free travel allowed by their
reformed governments, attended the conference for the first time
since Dachau survivors in France formed an association in 1946.
L'Amicale des Anciens de Dachau has held yearly reunions, but none
as big this weekend's.
   Many survivors said they looked forward to the annual meetings.
   ``Look how they throw themselves into each other's arms. The
agony, fear and degradation they suffered make them closer than
brothers,'' said Mimi Arnould, 86, widow of a past association
president.
   ``I'm always moved by these elderly survivors who resisted Hitler
and suffered so much because they chose not to collaborate, like so
many others in France,'' said Max Mannheim, 70, a Czech-born Jew who
survived Auschwitz and Dachau.
   Camp survivors on Saturday attended the opening of two new
exhibition rooms at the Edmond Michelet Center. The participants
paid special tribute to Edmond Michelet, who later became a Cabinet
minister under President Charles de Gaulle.
   Michelet was arrested and deported to Dachau in July 1943. He
became known as the ``camp chaplain,'' ministering to the sick and
boosting the morale of fellow prisoners. He volunteered to disenfect
typhus-ridden areas, and soon fell ill.
   ``We were both delirious with fever,'' Songy said. ``But somehow,
with Michelet next to me, under the same blanket, I felt protected.
He was like a father to me,'' he said, tears welling in his eyes.
   Michelet later served in several posts under de Gaulle, including
justice minister during the Algerian War of independence. He died in
1970.

   Arab leaders on Saturday condemned the new
right-wing government in Israel and blamed the United States for
allowing the Jewish state to pursue hard-line policies against the
Palestinians.
   Arab leaders also called on the United States to link aid to
Israel with cooperation in Mideast peace efforts.
   The Arab call came in a letter given Monday to Robert Pelletreau,
the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, where the Arab League is
headquartered. It was made available to the Associated Press in
Cyprus on Saturday. The letter was drafted on instructions from the
Arab League summit in Baghdad May 28-30.
   ``The Arab countries expect the United States to make a link
between aid extended to Israel and Israel's cooperation with peace
efforts. Such a step would restore credibility to the U.S. Middle
East policy and start a new era in the history of Arab-American
relations,'' the letter said.
   It also called on the United States to adopt ``practical steps''
to keep Israel from using U.S. aid to set up new settlements for
Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israeli-occupied territories.
   An expansion of settlements in the occupied lands is among the
policies of the new Israeli coalition formed Friday by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Parliament will vote on whether to approve
the new government soon.
   The coalition also pledged to ``uproot'' the 30-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and
renewed Israel's refusal to talk with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which it regards as a terrorist group.
   In Jordan, Foreign Minister Marwan Kassem said the new Israeli
government would have ``negative effects in the region.''
   ``In its current formula and with Shamir's statements of his
government's policies, all hopes for a just and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East are destroyed,'' he said during a break in a
parliamentary session.
   Kuwait state radio said the new Israeli government's program was
``a blueprint for war'' and declared the United States would be held
responsible for any Israeli aggression against Arab countries.
   Kassem also called on the United States to maintain its
18-month-old dialogue with the PLO, which most Arabs consider the
sole negotiating agent for the world's 5 million Palestinians.
   President Bush said on Friday he was considering halting those
talks due to a thwarted seaborne attempt to attack targets in Israel
mounted by the Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction.
   Bush suggested that if the talks were to continue, PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat should publicly condemn the attack. Arafat has denied
involvement in the assault, but refused to condemn it.
   Washington opened talks with the PLO in December 1988 after
Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Saudi Arabia's Okaz newspaper said the new Israeli coalition's
policies will mean the deportation of Palestinians from the occupied
lands, ``constituting a grave situation which we must confront.''
   The official Syrian daily Al-Thawra called the Israeli coalition
a ``government of extremists.''
   Bahrain's Akhbar Al-Khaleej daily blamed the United States for
``the hysterical extremist trends pervading Israel now through the
unconditional political and material support it provides.''

   Memo to Donald Trump:
   Maybe the repo men haven't taken the Trump Princess. Maybe your
check-cashing agency hasn't accused you of turning paper to rubber.
But it's clear that you've fallen on hard times _ your name has not
been affixed to any new edifice, sporting event or species in a
week, maybe two.
   You haven't asked for any advice; perhaps you are too humble. But
that hasn't prevented experts _ and some non-experts _ from passing
along a few suggestions on how to deal with your personal crisis,
your cash crisis, your image crisis.
   Attorney Marvin Mitchelson says that if he were sitting in your
financial house, he'd pull the window shades.
   ``It's a good time to lower the profile a little and let things
work themselves out a bit,'' says the celebrated celebrity divorce
lawyer. And with your spare time, he suggests some leisure reading:
``I'd reread the book, `Trump: The Art of The Deal.'''
   Victor Kiam, the guy who plugs his own razors in television
commercials, feels sympathy for a fellow entrepreneur who must take
``very unsatisfying steps.'' But he is encouraging: If you rebound,
your fall ``will be forgotten.''
   ``I would just keep hanging tough,'' says quarterback Doug
Flutie, who was paid about $4 million to play one season with the
Trump-owned New Jersey Generals of the now-defunct United States
Football League.
   ``He's a great negotiator, so I'd negotiate to the hilt,'' says
Bob Woolf, who negotiated the deal for Flutie.
   ``I would, just as he's doing, sit with my bankers and try and
restructure my debt,'' said Abraham Wallach, senior vice president
of First Capital Management Ltd., a New York-based real estate firm.
   David Peterson, a vice president of the American Collectors
Association, a Minneapolis-based trade group of more than 3,500 bill
collection agencies, passes along some advice more commonly given to
more common people.
   ``If you have trouble paying your bills, you need to tell your
creditors that you're having a problem, set up a repayment plan and
stick to it.''
   Not everyone is eager to advise you. Entertainer and fellow
casino owner Merv Griffin _ you remember how you boasted of getting
the better of him in trading casinos, the struggling Resorts
International for the Taj Mahal _ said through a publicist, ``I
don't comment or talk about other people's problems.''
   Financial analyst Marvin Roffman, fired under pressure from Trump
after he said the Taj was a bad deal, would change the Trump style
of management. ``You don't embarrass people,'' he says.
   ``You don't go around bad-mouthing your spouse or your
executives. I think that's the kind of actions that are bad for the
morale of everybody there.''
   Mitchelson has a few words to say about your separation from
Ivana: ``It's no crime to go through a divorce or separation.''
   Robert Kavesh, a professor of finance and economics at the Stern
School of Business at New York University, says `hold your head up
proudly.'' And p.s.: Prepare to sell your assets.
   ``I think on balance, Trump has taken a bad rap,'' Kavesh said.
``There's that mixture of envy and resentment that's frequently
lodged against a successful person. The fact is, in most of his
dealings, he's been quite clean and above board.''
   But James Grant, author of ``Grant's Interest Rate Observer'' and
a prominent critic of debt-financed wheeling and dealing, offers a
plan of action.
   ``If I were Donald Trump, I would sue Ivana for divorce and get a
$25 million settlement. With that, I'd put everything down on the
New York State Lottery and win. I think that's the most sensible
thing,'' he says.

<TEXT>
   BRIVE-LA-GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ About 300 survivors of the Nazi
concentration camp at Dachau reunited Saturday, remembering the joys
of liberation by U.S. troops 45 years ago and the horrors that went
before.
   Participants said the gathering in this south-central town was
the largest such reunion ever and the first to which Eastern
Europeans were free to attend.
   ``If we must force ourselves to forgive, we do not have the right
to forget, or to let others forget,'' said retired Gen. Andre
Delpech, 65, a French Resistance fighter tortured by the Gestapo in
1943 and sent to Dachau, five miles north of Munich, West Germany.
   ``As long as there are living witnesses, they have the duty to
testify, so future generations will know. That's why we're here,''
he said during the reunion at the Edmond Michelet Center.
   The center is a resistance museum named after a Dachau survivor
and resistance leader who had lived in this town 300 miles southwest
of Paris.
   Jacques Songy, 66, recalled the day the camp's 30,000 prisoners
were freed by young hearty American soldiers on April 29, 1945. Tens
of thousands of other prisoners did not live to see the day.
   The troops wept and vomited as they discovered naked corpses
piled 10 feet high, the stench of burning bodies, skeletal survivors
ravaged by hunger, disease and Nazi doctors' sadistic experiments,
Songy said.
   ``I was able to make my way out of the infirmary when suddenly I
saw a soldier take off his helmet _ there was this beautiful head of
long blond hair. It was such a shock to see a woman,'' he said.
   Songy later learned the woman was American photojournalist
Margaret Bourke White, whose pictures of Dachau were seen around the
world.
   ``I was so ashamed to be seen in such a state of physical
deterioration,'' said Songy, who at the time was 23 and had
shriveled to only 65 pounds.
   Built in March 1933, Dachau was the first of hundreds of Nazi
concentration camps that housed ``racial enemies of the state.''
Inmates at Dachau included Jews, Communists, clergymen and other
opponents of the Nazi regime.
   Nazi records say nearly 32,000 prisoners died there, but
thousands of other deaths were not registered. The records say
altogether 206,000 prisoners were kept at Dachau, although the
actual number is believed to be much higher.
   Although Dachau had showers equipped as gas chambers, historians
say it was not the site of mass exterminations like Auschwitz and
Treblinka. An estimated 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis.
   Many prisoners at Dachau worked until they died from exhaustion,
malnourishment, beatings, torture and harassament, disease and cold.
   Pierre Schillio _ at 13 the youngest French prisoner at Dachau _
remembers his father urging fellow inmates not to exert themselves,
even if meant an extra ration of dried bread.
   ``So many didn't listen to him. They lost their strength and
died,'' Schillio, 60, said in an emotional interview.
   Escape was virtually impossible. Dachau was surrounded by thick
concrete walls, electrified barbed wire and deep moats. Watchtowers
were manned round the clock. Those caught were hanged.
   The highlight of the weekend reunion was an exhibition of
memorabilia from Dachau, including documents and photographs, many
never before displayed in France.
   The show has drawn more than 2,000 visitors, mostly young people,
since it opened 10 days ago.
   ``No matter how much you read about the camps, there's a shock
when you see the pictures,'' said Natalie, a 15-year-old girl from
the town. ``You can't believe human beings could do this to other
human beings.''
   Several Eastern Europeans, enjoying free travel allowed by their
reformed governments, attended the conference for the first time
since Dachau survivors in France formed an association in 1946.
L'Amicale des Anciens de Dachau has held yearly reunions, but none
as big this weekend's.
   Many survivors said they looked forward to the annual meetings.
   ``Look how they throw themselves into each other's arms. The
agony, fear and degradation they suffered make them closer than
brothers,'' said Mimi Arnould, 86, widow of a past association
president.
   ``I'm always moved by these elderly survivors who resisted Hitler
and suffered so much because they chose not to collaborate, like so
many others in France,'' said Max Mannheim, 70, a Czech-born Jew who
survived Auschwitz and Dachau.
   Camp survivors on Saturday attended the opening of two new
exhibition rooms at the Edmond Michelet Center. The participants
paid special tribute to Edmond Michelet, who later became a Cabinet
minister under President Charles de Gaulle.
   Michelet was arrested and deported to Dachau in July 1943. He
became known as the ``camp chaplain,'' ministering to the sick and
boosting the morale of fellow prisoners. He volunteered to disenfect
typhus-ridden areas, and soon fell ill.
   ``We were both delirious with fever,'' Songy said. ``But somehow,

He was like a father to me,'' he said, tears welling in his eyes.
   Michelet later served in several posts under de Gaulle, including
justice minister during the Algerian War of independence. He died in
1970.

Aid</HEAD>

   A magazine said Saturday that the
Soviet Union has expressed willingness to accept a united Germany's
membership in NATO, but wants $20 billion in Western aid and some
changes in the Western alliance.
   The Hamburg-based news magazine Der Spiegel quoted an
unidentified adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl as saying
West Germany is ready to supply aid ``within a proper amount'' to
Moscow but wants some of the assistance to come from the United
States and the European Economic Community.
   The magazine said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
indicated the Soviets are seeking $20 billion.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in an interview with
Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio, refused to comment on the figure
reported by Spiegel, saying only that talks on a variety of
unification issues are still under way.
   ``We are naturally in favor of closer economic cooperation and of
financial cooperation. We're ready for that, and we're talking about
that with the Soviets,'' said Genscher.
   Moscow opposes membership for a united Germany in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Western alliance has been
insisting upon it.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday held talks with President Bush
on efforts to win full Soviet approval for unification.
   After his return to Bonn on Saturday, Kohl appeared to signal
progress was being made on the military issue.
   ``We have reason to be confident that the internal and global
aspects of German unity can be solved on time,'' the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper quoted him as saying. The Sunday newspaper made its report
available in advance.

<TEXT>
   Project STAR has turned on many young
people in Kansas City to the high of keeping their friends while
turning down their offers of alcohol or drugs. It takes more than
just saying ``no.''
   ``We investigated the programs based on being scared or morals
and they just don't work,'' said project founder, Ewing Kauffman.
``Ours does.''
   Kauffman, the owner of the Kansas City Royals baseball team and
founder of Marion Laboratories, now Marion Merrell Dow, has
contributed more than $3 million to the 6-year-old program.
   Project STAR (Students Taught Awareness and Resistance) has
reached about 300,000 students in Missouri and Kansas since it
began. All 15 public school districts in the Kansas City area, and
many private schools, participate in the project, said Calvin
Cormack, executive director. It also is taught in Indiana and most
of Missouri and Kansas.
   STAR recently received national recognition after a five-year
study by the Midwestern Drug Abuse Prevention Research Project
showed that students who went through the program were significantly
less likely to use drugs or to drink than other students.
   Kauffman says young people do drugs because of peer pressure.
   ``If you belong to a group of four or five girls and they want
another one to smoke marijuana, she wants to remain in the group and
keep her friends,'' he said. `And just saying ``no'' won't get the
job done, because they ask you again and again.
   ``So we teach a dozen different ways to say `no.' Like `I'm
afraid to smoke because my father will whip me until I tell him and
then he'll call your father,''' he said.
   Katie Aholt, 13, went through STAR at Pleasant Lea Jr. High
School in Lee's Summit and said she learned a lot about saying `no.'
   ``I really didn't know, before, how to say it without hurting my
friends' feelings. But now I can do it and still keep my friends,''
she said.
   Talking to her parents is easier now, too.
   ``Now if one of my friends approached me (with drugs) I could
just sit down and talk to my parents,'' she said. ``And before, I
really didn't know how serious it can be to your body, and how it
can change you.''
   Charles R. Schuster, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, which paid for the evaluation of Project STAR, praised the
program for getting schools, parents, the media and community groups
to work together in ``changing the social norms for drug use and
providing a healthy drug-free environment for all people.''
   The study concluded that 14.2 percent of Project STAR alumni now
juniors or seniors in high school smoked marijuana in the month
before they were surveyed, compared with 20.2 percent who did not go
through STAR. For alcohol, 36 percent of Project STAR high schoolers
drank alcohol in the preceding month, compared with 50 percent of
those not in program.
   Classroom lessons begin in the seventh grade, which Cormack
called a critical time.
   ``Onset patterns show most kids get involved (in drugs) between
the ages of 10 and 15, so those are critical decision years,'' he
said.
   Katie said kids like the program because it makes talk about
drugs and alcohol realistic. Scare stories don't work, in her view.
   ``I think kids get into it because there are activities and
role-playing and stuff. It's more real,'' she said.
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan saw STAR in action in 1986 during
a visit to Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Kansas City.
Students put on a skit showing how to refuse drugs, while Mrs.
Reagan watched and then asked a few questions.
   She seemed surprised when she asked students at the inner-city
school if they had used drugs _ and no hands went up. The response
did not surprise Robbie Alexander, who teaches at King and trains
other teachers in STAR curriculum.
   ``The kids really wanted to refuse but they didn't know how. This
teaches kids to refuse ... in a friendly, assertive manner without
hurting their feelings,'' she said. ``And we aren't telling them not
to do drugs; we let them make a decision.''
   Tactics made famous by programs such as ``Scared Straight'' are
ignored. Instead, students make lists of the consequences _ good and
bad _ of using drugs or alcohol.
   ``We use their minds instead,'' she said. ``If you bring in an
ex-convict who tells them what she went through, the kids say `Well
she looks all right now, she came through it; so could I.'''
   Parents get involved by helping with homework assignments, which
gives them an opening to discuss a tough subject.
   ``I have highly educated men and women telling me that through
Project STAR, this is the first time they can talk to their kids
about alcohol and drugs,'' Kauffman said.

<HEAD>Death Toll Climbs Over 100 in Central Asia Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities closed the border between the Central
Asian republics of Kirghizia and Uzbekistan to prevent the spread of
ethnic violence that has killed more than 100 people, it was
reported Saturday.
   The Soviet Defense Ministry has sent thousands of troops to the
region, but the situation in Uzbekistan and Kirghizia remained
volatile, Tass said in a dispatch from the Kirghizian capital of
Frunze.
   Clashes between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks _ both Sunni Moslems _
began June 2. At issue is the allocation of plots of land for
housing in the densely populated, poverty-stricken region.
   The unrest was the latest in a series of ethnic troubles
confronting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms
have allowed many Soviet minorities to express pent-up grievances.
   Kirghizia's leaders declared Monday an official day of mourning
for those killed in the unrest, the government daily Izvestia
reported Saturday.
   Tass said the death toll from the week of ethnic violence had
risen to 102. It quoted the Kirghizian Interior Ministry as saying
436 people had been wounded since Monday.
   On Saturday morning, a crowd of about 15,000 young Uzbeks armed
with stones, sticks, knives and other weapons massed on the border
at Andijan in Uzbekistan, but a cordon of troops kept them from
crossing into Kirghizia, said Viktor Verbkin, deputy editor of
Kirghizia's official news agency.
   The Interior Ministry troops stretched along the entire border,
and the crowd eventually dispersed, he said in a telephone interview.
   Viktor Gusev, Uzbekistan's deputy interior minister, said in a
telephone interview that Andijan was quiet later in the day.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman in Moscow, Dmitri Selznov, said
Saturday that under the state of emergency imposed in Uzbekistan,
barricades and troops had been used to close the border between the
Andijan and Osh regions.
   The president of Uzbekistan declared the state of emergency
Friday in border districts, including Andijan, because of what Tass
called ``a sharp aggravation of the situation'' as residents tried
to stage ``mass disorders.''
   A state of emergency also was in effect in Osh, where troops
patrolled the streets, and in Frunze, Kirghizia's capital.
   That state of emergency was declared Thursday after clashes broke
out in Frunze, where cars were destroyed and thousands of people
surrounded Communist Party and government buildings.
   Tass said 225 residences, 31 state buildings and 62 cars had been
torched since the violence broke out.

   President Bush was blessed with
fisherman's luck Saturday, reeling in 10 largemouth bass from a
private pond near the presidential retreat.
   ``He did real well,'' said Bush's fishing guide, Robert W.
Abraham of Smithsburg, Md. Abraham, who owns the quarter-acre pond
where he and Bush went fishing, said he was very impressed with
Bush's angling skills.
   The president caught most of the fish on plastic worms, Abraham
said. Bush also tried using his fly rod for bass, but had no luck
with it.
   Abraham said the pond was stocked several years ago, but now
naturally sustains its population.
   Bush threw back all the bass, which measured from 8 inches to a
foot, said White House spokesman John Herrick.
   It was one of Bush's better days, according to press reports of
previous catches. The White House didn't know if this was a personal
best.
   The outing was Bush's first visit to Abraham's pond. Abraham said
he took President Carter fishing in 1980 both in the pond for
largemouth and in nearby waters for smallmouth. Carter is an avid
fly fisherman.
   Bush returns to work Sunday, meeting in the evening at the White
House with Mexican President Carlos Salinas Gortari. The two leaders
will talk about opening negotiations on a free trade agreement.

<HEAD>Pakistan's Prime Minister Holds Out Hopes for Kashmir Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said
Saturday the threat of war with India still exists but that recent
dialogue raises hopes the nations' differences can be resolved
peacefully.
   The two are at odds over Kashmir, a former princely state claimed
by both countries. Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan have fought three
wars, two of them over Kashmir.
   ``One cannot say the threat of war has faded away,'' Ms. Bhutto
said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``But it is good
that the two sides, after a long gap, are beginning _ no matter how
tentatively _ to talk to each other.''
   Both countries recently massed troops near the border, and Indian
Prime Minister V.P. Singh told his countrymen to be
``psychologically prepared'' for another war.
   Tensions were eased slightly last month when India made an
overture. Pakistan, in turn, proposed an urgent meeting between the
two countries' foreign secretaries to discuss matters including
Kashmir. India says it is considering the suggestion.
   ``We are keen to see that Pakistan and India resolve their
problems and outstanding disputes, including Kashmir, and we do view
with cautious optimism the forthcoming talks at the foreign
secretaries level,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   Shortly after the prime minister came to power in December 1988,
India and Pakistan began talks aimed at normalizing relations. That
process was suspended during the 1989 Indian elections, which led to
a change of government.
   India and Pakistan have been uneasy neighbors since they were
created by the 1947 partition that ended British colonial rule of
the subcontinent. They routinely accuse each of inciting ethnic and
religious violence in each other's territory.
   New Delhi accuses Pakistan of arming and training secessionists
in the border states of Punjab and Jammu-Kashmir, India's only
Moslem state.
   Islamabad denies the allegations and accuses India of stirring
trouble in the southern border province of Sindh, where ethnic
bloodshed and gangland-style warfare have left more than 400 people
dead in the past month.
   The violence, which has faded and flared for more than a decade,
is blamed on native Sindhis and Mohajirs, or Moslem Indians who
immigrated to Pakistan following the partition and now dominate
Sindh's two largest cities, Karachi and Hyderabad.
   Late last month, Ms. Bhutto was forced to call out the army to
help restore law and order, a move that has heightened fears that
Pakistan may soon return to military rule for the third time in its
43-year history.
   Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan's constitution allows the military to be
called in to help the civilian government keep law and order.
   ``The military is called time and again to aid the civil
government. This is their constitutional duty and this is their
obligation to the elected government,'' she said.

   Actress Rita Moreno was host of the
20th annual Golden Eagle Awards honoring Hispanic achievement in the
entertainment industry.
   Stage and screen actor Raul Julia received the outstanding actor
Golden Eagle, and the outstanding actress was Rosana De Soto. Ms. De
Soto is best known for the movie ``La Bamba,'' about 1950s rocker
Ritchie Valens, while Julia has worked in many films and plays,
including recent appearances in an off-Broadway production of
``Macbeth'' and in the film ``Romero.''
   Special awards went to farm labor organizer Cesar Chavez, who
received a lifetime achievement award, and entertainer Bob Hope, who
was honored for his ``tireless efforts on behalf of dozens of
organizations.''
   Pop vocalist Gloria Estefan, lead singer of the Miami Sound
Machine, was named outstanding female performer, during Friday's
two-hour ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   Emmanuel, a Mexican-born male vocalist whose 10 albums have sold
more than 10 million copies, was named outstanding male performer.
   Actress Joanna Kerns, star of ABC-TV's series ``Growing Pains,''
was awarded an outstanding TV actress Golden Eagle for her realistic
portrayal of a working mother.
   Actor Paul Rodriguez, who appears on the new CBS series ``Grand
Slam,'' was named outstanding TV actor.
   The 1990 Golden Eagle Award for most promising actor was given to
Francesco Quinn, the oldest son of actor Anthony Quinn.
Peruvian-born Jenny Gago was named most promising actress.
   The awards were conceived in 1970 by Ricardo Montalban, Richard
Hernandez and other Hispanic actors as a way to change Hollywood's
stereotypes of Latino actors.
   ``Most were playing roles as gigolos, hoodlums, servants,
prostitutes and lazy good for nothing Mexicans,'' according to an
event program.

   Roy Rogers, ``the king of the cowboys,''
is back in the saddle. Rogers is teaming up with some country music
stars to record an album of songs with a western flavor.
   RCA Records officials said Friday that Rogers already has
recorded the song ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' with country star K.T.
Oslin.
   Other singers who have agreed to participate in the project
include Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Van Shelton and the
group Restless Heart.
   ``I haven't made any (records) for a long time,'' Rogers, 78,
told reporters. ``They talked me into it, so I thought I'd take a
try at it.''
   The album is expected to be released in 1991.
   Rogers helped organize the western singing group, ``Sons of the
Pioneers,'' in 1932. He left the group in 1937 to pursue a movie
career.
   He and his wife, actress Dale Evans, have recorded more than 400
songs in their career.

   Country singer Vern Gosdin says he turned
his 1989 divorce into a career boost.
   Nine songs on the album ``Alone'' came from the breakup of his
11-year marriage, Gosdin said during an interview last week.
   ``I cried all the way to the bank,'' he said, chuckling. ``I can
laugh now that it's over, can't I?''
   Since 1984, Gosdin has had a string of hit records, including ``I
Can Tell by the Way You Dance,'' ``Chiseled in Stone'' and ``Set 'em
Up Joe.''
   ``Chiseled in Stone'' was voted song of the year in 1989 by the
Country Music Association.
   Gosdin, 55, will have an album of his greatest hits coming out
later this year.

   Bob Hope will speak at Palm Springs
High School's graduation thanks to the persistence of senior class
leaders.
   Repeated inquiries to Hope went unanswered, so Robert
Shahnazarian, the senior class president, and Greg Schmalle, the
vice president, decided to visit the comedian's Los Angeles office
on the spur of the moment.
   ``Greg had really been pushing to get Ronald Reagan as our
speaker,'' Shahnazarian said. ``He couldn't do it, but he invited us
to his Century City office to give us a letter we could read at
graduation.
   ``So after we went there, we went unannounced to Mr. Hope's
office and we told his secretary what we were there for,'' he said.
``She went away for a few minutes and when she came back, she said
he had agreed to speak.''
   Only holders of tickets given to the 600 graduates can attend
Thursday's graduation at the Convention Center.
   Hope's publicist, Ward Grant, said Friday that the 87-year-old
entertainer speaks at two high school or college commencements each
year.
   ``Bob decided he would speak at Palm Springs because it is close
to his heart,'' Grant said. ``Palm Springs is, after all, one of his
three homes _ Palm Springs, Toluca Lake and airport terminals.''

   No, he isn't on the mound, but the cellar-dwelling Braves

tickets _ as often as every half-inning. At the ballpark, Ernest's
6-foot-tall face grins maniacally above the Gate G ticket windows.
   Braves' promotions director Miles McRea can't understand why
everybody's down on Ernest, a veteran pitchman of numerous

   ``His movies are hits,'' McRea said. ``He's been used for
Coca-Cola, Disney _ reputable companies. But who gets all the

   A man catching a nap in a garbage bin was scooped
up by a disposal truck that began crushing the load, breaking the
sleeper's leg before a passerby heard screams and alerted the driver.
   ``I heard him yell `Help!' and I thought it was a guy singing

   ``I never thought there would be anybody inside a garbage truck.''
   Taylor Glenn Doughty, a transient, recalled being squashed twice
before the machinery stopped, police said after questioning him at a
hospital.
   The truck operator believes he inadvertently picked up Doughty at
a paper company about three blocks from where the rescue was made
late Thursday, police said.
   Doughty said he couldn't be sure where he was picked up, because
``I was pretty snockered.''

<HEAD>Jury Awards $5.27 Million to Woman Paralyzed in Toyota Truck
Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A faulty Toyota pickup design was cited
as a jury awarded $5.27 million to a woman for injuries they
suffered in a 1984 accident.
   The Superior Court jury also awarded $100,000 to the two
daughters of Cynthia Gosper, 35, of Garden Grove, who was left a
quadriplegic from the accident during a family vacation in Arizona.
The daughters suffered minor injuries in the same accident.
   Attorneys for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. of Torrance said
they will appeal Friday's decision.
   Jurors found that a design flaw in the 1981 4-wheel-drive SR5
pickup Gosper was driving allowed it to roll off a highway after it
was struck from behind. The driver's side door popped open, throwing
Gosper from the truck.
   Officials with Toyota Motor Sales said the award was one of the
largest ever imposed against the company.
   Toyota attorneys insisted at trial that the truck's design is
safe and that the force of the collision caused it to roll over.
   An analyst with the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based
group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, praised the decision.
   ``I think the jury was correct in their decision that the vehicle
was designed in an unstable manner,'' said analyst Sam Cole.
   The $100,000 will be split between Gosper's two daughters,
Christine, 11, and Melissa, 9, who suffered cuts and bruises in the
accident.

<HEAD>Religious Leaders Say Euthanasia Issue Involves Morals, Not Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legal debates over a doctor helping an Alzheimer's
sufferer commit suicide with his machine are missing the point, say
religious leaders who believe such moral issues fall outside the
realm of courts.
   ``Suicide is a word for self-murder, and some 5,000 years of
Judeo-Christian morality has always defined it as wrong,'' said Jay
Berman, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit.
``And to aid in that would be equally morally wrong.
   ``The debate over euthanasia is cast today solely in terms of
legal and illegal,'' he said. ``The debate should actually address
what is morally right and morally wrong.''
   The debate was renewed by the death of Janet Adkins, 54, of
Portland, Ore. On Monday, she rode with Dr. Jack Kevorkian and two
of his sisters in his rusty Volkswagen van to a park north of
Detroit. There, she pushed the button on a device that pumped lethal
chemicals into her veins. Death came within five or six minutes,
Kevorkian said.
   Adkins told Kevorkian she had been diagnosed with incurable
Alzheimer's disease and sought help from the retired pathologist in
committing suicide.
   Oakland County Circuit Judge Alice Gilbert ordered Kevorkian on
Friday to not use his device until prosecutors determine whether it
is legal. Michigan courts have differed in interpreting Michigan law
in such cases.
   But laws aren't the question, Berman said Friday.
   Deeming something legal doesn't make it automatically right, he
argued. ``It's legal to drive a car up to a 0.10 blood-alcohol
level, but it's not right.''
   Adkins and her husband, Ronald, discussed her death wish with
their minister, Alan G. Deale of the First Unitarian Church in
Portland, where a memorial service for Adkins was scheduled for
Sunday afternoon.
   Deale said his denomination supports the right to
self-determination for those who become terminally ill.
   Adkins was in the early stages of Alzheimer's, a degenerative
brain and nerve disorder that robs people of their memories, ability
to function and eventually their lives. An estimated 4 million U.S.
adults, mostly over age 65, have the disease.
   Her husband said she despaired as her memory failed.
   ``We support the whole idea that the dignity of life must be
maintained,'' Deale said. ``But we support the freedom of choice.
Life only has dignity if it has some quality.''
   Muhammed Karoub of the Detroit-based Federation of Islamic
Associations disagreed. Kevorkian and Adkins, he said, ``interfered
in a normal process that might better be left to God and the medical
profession.''
   ``In the Islamic religion, God works through his learned people,
including doctors. Sometimes (doctors) have to temper their
feelings. They have to be careful; almost an arrogance creeps in
when dealing with life and death,'' Karoub said.
   The Eastern Orthodox Church considers euthanasia unacceptable
under any circumstances, said the Rev. Demetrios Kavadas, pastor of
Assumption Greek Orthodox Church in suburban St. Clair Shores.
   ``No one, apart from God who gives life and death, has the right
to take the life of another,'' he said.
   Sister Elizabeth McMillan of the St. Louis-based Catholic Health
Association said she considered Kevorkian's actions immoral and
unethical.
   ``What concerns me about the involvement of a physician in the
taking of a life is that it undermines in a radical and important
way the trust that has to be there between patient and physician and
community and physician,'' McMillan said.
   ``Doctors are supposed to be healers.''
   President William F. Schultz of the Boston-based Unitarian
Universalist Association said such criticism is hypocritical and
absurd.
   ``Doctor-assisted suicide is humane. It's far more humane than
allowing individuals to botch the job in a suicide attempt, which
creates far more suffering for the self and loved ones. So I'm
supportive of doctor-assisted suicide,'' he said.
   Kevorkian is scornful of religion and its influence over the
medical profession, which largely has condemned his views on
euthanasia.
   ``Religious dogma has become part of the marrow of humanity. We
can't get rid of it,'' he said during a March interview. ``There
should be absolutely no connection between medicine and religion,
but there is, and it's paralyzing.''
   Berman said Kevorkian and other advocates have wrongly presented
euthanasia as compassionate.
   ``I personally have, in Vietnam, heard wounded soldiers cry out,
`Kill me, kill me.' All our moral intonation is to help them recover
and, failing that, to alleviate their suffering. But we can never
kill them.''

   Newly elected opposition lawmakers on
Saturday praised British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her
anti-Communist ideology at an impromptu meeting of Ukraine's
Communist-dominated Parliament.
   The Conservative Party prime minister, standing beneath a giant
statue of Lenin, engaged in lively exchanges about democracy with
deputies assembled at the Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine.
   But, seated beside the Parliament's Communist president,
Volodymyr Ivashko, Mrs. Thatcher backed down when opposition members
urged her to recognize Soviet Lithuania and to declare support for
separatists in the Ukraine.
   ``I can see you are trying to get me involved in your politics,''
she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher addressed the Ukraine's Parliament on the third day
of her four-day visit to the Soviet Union. She arrived here after
conferring with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow on Friday.
   The visit is aimed partly at showing solidarity with Gorbachev,
beset by acute economic problems and secessionist moves as he
battles to implement his reform policies.
   Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia have taken steps toward seceding
from the Soviet Union, while separatists in some of the other Soviet
republics have indicated they would like to follow suit.
   Several hundred separatists demonstrated outside the Kiev
Parliament holding placards denouncing ``imperialist Moscow.''
   The lawmakers, two-thirds of whom belong to the Communist Party _
which won handsomely in the Republic's first free elections this
year _ gave Mrs. Thatcher a standing ovation after her address.
   Questions began with a bland inquiry about policy making in
Britain, but quickly became controversial when members of four
non-Communist parties that have formed an opposition grouping took
the floor.
   Opposition member Genrikh Altunyan said he was one of 10 former
political prisoners in the new Parliament.
   ``We know it is due to you and to President Reagan that we have
been able to be here today,'' said Altunyan. ``We are very thankful
to you and will never forget your support when we languished in
labor camps.''
   There was scattered applause, but most lawmakers stared ahead in
silence.
   Altunyan, an Armenian, spent 9{ years in prison or labor camps
from 1969 to 1987 for ``anti-Soviet activities.''
   Mrs. Thatcher thanked him, but said: ``It is necessary for
democracy to be underpinned by the rule of law ... rights clearly
stated, infringements also clearly stated.''
   Another opposition member, Igor Juchnovksy, told Mrs. Thatcher he
was disappointed that Britain did not recognize Lithuania as a
sovereign state. He also said that Britain should open an embassy in
the Ukraine.
   Mrs. Thatcher replied saying that Britain did not, for example,
have an embassy in California or in the Canadian province of Quebec.
   In her address, Mrs. Thatcher stressed a central theme of her
visit: admiration for the Soviet Union in its daunting task of
reform.
   ``You are bringing about in the Soviet Union changes of a
magnitude which have never been attempted before in history,'' she
said. ``We wish you well.''
   In Moscow earlier, Mrs. Thatcher assured six Jewish refuseniks _
citizens who have been refused permission to emigrate _ that Britain
will continue campaigning for emigration rights. But she reaffirmed
her opposition to Israel settling emigrants in the occupied
territories.
   On Friday, during a news conference with Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher
said Israel was ``almost letting down those of us who have
campaigned vigorously'' for Jewish emigration.
   Gorbachev reiterated warnings that he may curb Jewish emigration,
at a record high under his liberalized policies, unless Israel stops
emigrants from settling in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel says that about 35,000 Soviet Jews have arrived this year.
But it says it has no policy of settling them in territories seized
in the 1967 Middle East war, and that only a few hundred have
settled there so far.
   Several thousand people pressed against police barriers and
cheered as Mrs. Thatcher arrived in Kiev Saturday to tour a British
trade and cultural exhibition. She was greeted by a British military
band playing ``Scotland the Brave.''
   She later took a brief walk through the center of Kiev and
visited the city's towering Babi Yar monument. It stands at a gully
in a park where 100,000 Jews and other Ukrainians were slaughtered
during the Nazi occupation in World War II.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Thatcher travels to a region of Armenia that was
devastated by an earthquake 18 months ago.

   A jailed animal rights activist may not
have a visit from her dogs while she awaits sentencing on an
attempted murder conviction, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Peter C. Dorsey ruled Friday that state
correction officials are not obligated to allow Fran Stephanie
Trutt's four dogs to visit her at the Niantic prison for women.
   Trutt's lawyer, John Williams, said he will press on with efforts
to allow visits with her dogs after Trutt is sentenced.
   ``It's easy to make a joke about this,'' Williams said. ``But the
truth of the matter is her dogs are her only friends.''
   Under a plea agreement, Trutt is expected to be sentenced in July
to a term that would end March 31, 1991.
   ``An exception in the plaintiff's situation will provide a basis
for similar requests by others and for all sorts of animals,''
Dorsey said.
   Trutt, 34, pleaded no contest in April to a charge that she
planted a bomb in the parking lot of U.S. Surgical Corp., in an
attempt to kill the company's chairman, Leon Hirsch.
   The company uses laboratory dogs in showing surgeons how to use
its patented surgical staplers, which can be used in place of
sutures.

   Soviet soldiers opened fire on a West
German private plane after it crossed into Soviet airspace on
Saturday, the semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported. The plane
apparently was not hit.
   The dispatch said the plane, apparently a transport aircraft,
took off from the Black Sea coastal province of Trabzon about noon
for the Iranian city of Tabriz.
   When the plane reached the Turkish-Soviet border at Sarp, Soviet
soldiers opened fire on it, Anatolia said.
   Cafer Yildiz, acting governor of Artvin province at the Soviet
border, told The Associated Press by telephone that Turkish military
authorities at the border witnessed the incident.
   He said they saw the plane return to Turkish airspace and
continue flying east.
   The whereabouts of the plane were unknown after the incident.

   Thousands of local and foreign observers
will look on when Bulgarians cast ballots Sunday in the country's
first free elections in 58 years.
   The parliamentary vote pits the leadership of the old Communist
Party, now renamed the Socialist Party, against an opposition
coalition called the Union of Democratic Forces, which wants a swift
move to a Western-style market economy.
   The government on Saturday night announced a ban on all exit
polls and the circulation of any information about the election
results before the official announcement by the Central Electoral
Commission, the state news agency BTA reported.
   The commission, acting on a protest from the main opposition
alliance, on Thursday banned an exit poll to be conducted by the
West German Infas institute with Bulgarian partners.
   The race includes the Socialists and 36 other parties vying for
the 400 seats in the Grand National Assembly. Only one other party,
the Bulgarian Agrarian Party, is expected to win a significant
number of votes.
   Almost 6.5 million of the nearly 9 million Bulgarians are
eligible to vote in the first multiparty elections since 1932.
   Official pre-election surveys have given the ruling Socialists _
heirs to four decades of totalitarian rule _ a commanding lead of
between 42 percent and 49 percent of the vote.
   The same polls have shown the Union of Democratic Forces a
distant second with 21 percent to 28 percent of the vote and the
mainstream Agrarian Party third with 10 percent to 15 percent.
   In a recent interview Union chairman Zhelyu Zhelev rejected the
official forecasts as ``manipulations'' and said his coalition hoped
for at least 50 percent of the vote.
   Diplomats and some Bulgarian observers predicted a fairly close
race between the Socialists and the Union.
   The polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 6 p.m., with a possible
one-hour extension if people are still waiting in lines at 6 p.m.
   Vote counting was to begin shortly after the polls closed, but it
was not clear when initial results would be released.
   Half the seats in Parliament will be decided by direct vote and
half by proportional representation. Parties must get a minimum of 4
percent of the vote to win any seats in Parliament.
   A runoff election is scheduled on June 17 for races in which no
candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote.
   The campaign was marred by some violence and a lot of
mudslinging, largely between the government's newspaper, Duma, and
the opposition daily, Demokratsiya.
   Several deaths during the campaign are under investigation, among
them the slaying of a sympathizer of the Union of Democratic Forces,
shot and killed by an army officer in northern Shumen.
   However, leaders of the three leading parties refrained from
personal attacks in a televised debate broadcast live Friday night,
apparently hoping to avoid antagonizing voters.
   Zhelev, Socialist chief Alexander Lilov and Agrarian leader
Viktor Valkov agreed on the need for a coalition government to
tackle the nation's serious economic and political problems. But
Zhelev insisted his alliance would not govern alongside the former
Communists.
   Many international organizations as well as individual countries
have sent observers to watch the balloting.
   On Friday, an American-led international observer group
criticized flaws in the electoral process.
   The group cited the exclusion of about 200,000 ethnic Turks who
fled Bulgaria last summer to escape religious and ethnic persecution
under former Communist leader Todor Zhivkov, who was ousted in
November.
   The leader of a citizens' group, the Association for Free and
Fair Elections, said about 10,000 members would monitor voting.
   ``We have never had free and fair elections,'' said Kevork
Kevorkyan, the group's leader. ``This is the main reason why we
undertake such an effort.''
   ``One does not get easily accustomed to freedom.''

   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall said
Saturday that Hungary intends to fully withdraw from the Warsaw Pact
even if the alliance plans to dissolve eventually.
   But he said Hungary wanted to negotiate its pullout with the
other six member nations rather than making a move on its own.
   Antall spoke to reporters Saturday after returning from a Warsaw
Pact meeting in Moscow, where he said he had conveyed the Hungarian
position to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We made it clear that given the altered circumstances, we
consider the Warsaw Pact and in particular its military aspect
outdated,'' he said. ``We also made it clear that we want to leave
the military organization of the Pact and the Warsaw Pact itself,
even if it is not dissolved.''
   Asked about Moscow's response, Antall said: ``The Soviet leaders
acknowledged our position.''
   At the summit, the allies began planning the transformation from
a military to a political body in the wake of the momentous changes
in Europe.
   ``The Warsaw Pact in its present form plays a certain diplomatic
and political role,'' Antall said. But he said Hungarian leaders
believe ``the military aspect of the Pact should be dissolved by the
end of 1991.''
   Moscow has agreed to remove all its troops stationed on Hungarian
territory by the middle of next year. The Hungarian leader said
Hungary wants to regain control of its own military as well.
   ``We told Moscow that we intend to restore full sovereignty over
the Hungarian armed forces, revamp our forces into a defensive
organization, and will not participate in joint Warsaw Pact military
exercises,'' Antall said.
   Antall said Hungary would ``take her armed forces from under
Warsaw Pact command even while we are still a member.''
   In an interview published Saturday in the West Berlin newspaper
Morgenpost, East Germany's defense minister, Rainer Eppelmann,
predicted the breakup of the Warsaw Pact's military structures this
year.
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowieczki, who is currently
visiting Budapest and joined Antall at the news conference, declined
to comment directly on the Hungarian position.
   However, he said work on establishing a collective European
security system as favored by the Warsaw Pact members ``must begin
without delay.''
   Antall said Hungary was mindful of regional effects of its
actions.
   ``We do not want to make a move that would disturb the German
reunification process, nor one that could possibly upset the
timetable of the Soviet troop withdrawals from Hungary,'' he said.

   A Soviet runaway said Saturday he
hijacked an Aeroflot airliner to Sweden because he was upset about a
quarrel with his father over a broken moped. No one was hurt.
   The plane, carrying a crew of seven and 114 passengers, was on a
domestic flight from the Byelorussian capital of Minsk to the Soviet
Arctic port of Murmansk when the youth threatened the crew with a
fake grenade, authorities said.
   The incident ended peacefully when Dimitry Semionov, 17,
surrendered to police an hour after the Tupolev 154 jetliner landed
at Stockholm's international airport.
   ``He just said he wanted to stay in Sweden,'' said police
inspector Barry Ivarsson.
   None of the passengers knew the plane had been hijacked until it
landed early Saturday at Arlanda airport, 25 miles north of
Stockholm, one said.
   ``Everything was peaceful and quiet,'' passenger Marya Yeryomenko
told a television interviewer before the flight returned to the
Soviet Union. ``The stewardess only told us after we had landed that
we were in Stockholm.''
   Semionov, a high school student from Minsk, said his father had
told him to get out of the house after their quarrel.
   ``My parents drove me away, my father did. I didn't have anywhere
to stay,'' he said in a radio interview, speaking through an
interpreter. ``I didn't wish to harm anyone, but I saw no other
method. ... Everything got worse and worse and I was very
disappointed.''
   The plane was searched for explosives before it returned to the
Soviet Union Saturday morning with its passengers.
   Semionov's lawyer, Birger Ohlson, said his client was in
Stockholm's Kronoberg prison and would be arraigned Sunday.
   ``He had quarreled with his father about something as trivial as
a broken moped,'' Ohlson said in a television interview. ``His
father reprimanded him for not having mended it properly, so the boy
got angry and sold the moped. His father wanted the money, and when
he didn't get it he took the keys and drove him out.''
   The lawyer said Semionov told him he had not planned the hijack,
but ``got the idea on the plane.''
   Semionov faced up to four years in a prison in Sweden but would
be subject to much harsher punishment in the Soviet Union, the
lawyer said.
   ``According to what has been said, he could face very grave
consequences, even the death penalty,'' Ohlson said.
   Ohlson said Soviet authorities had not requested the youth's
extradition. Semionov was expected to seek asylum.
   ``It may sound unpatriotic, but I know that the society here is
freer and the change in our country is too slow,'' the teen-ager
said in the radio interview.
   After the plane was commandeered, Finnish authorities initially
refused it permission to fly through their airspace, but then
relented.
   Alexander Krasilnikov, a spokesman for the Soviet ministry of
civil aviation in Moscow, confirmed that the plane had returned
safely and there were no injuries among the passengers and crew.

   One of two brothers charged with
killing their wealthy parents apparently tried to escape, officials
said after finding his leg chain was nearly severed.
   A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy noticed the link on Lyle
Menendez's leg chain was nearly cut through while he was unlocking
the defendants' manacles for Friday's court appearance, said
sheriff's Sgt. Robert Stoneman. ``It was cut to the point where just
slight pressure or twisting would have broken the link,'' Stoneman
said.
   ``We subsequently found in a search of their jail cells,
handwritten documents that we seized that may be of evidentiary
value concerning this escape attempt,'' Stoneman added. He refused
to elaborate.
   No charges were immediately filed.
   The brothers, 22-year-old Lyle and 19-year-old Erik Menendez, are
accused of murdering their parents. Jose Menendez, 45, and his wife,
Kitty, 44, died Aug. 20 in the family's Beverly Hills mansion. The
couple was hit numerous times with shotgun blasts.
   Menendez was a wealthy executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a
video distribution company. The brothers claim they found the bodies
when they returned home from a night out. Prosecutors allege the
siblings were motivated to kill their parents to claim their
father's wealth.
   Also Friday, the news media lost an attempt to be privy to
conversations considered key evidence in the murder case of two
brothers charged with killing their wealthy parents.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht convened a separate hearing
at which lawyers for The Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and
ABC-TV argued that matters being discussed in secret could be
reviewed at least in part with the press and public present.
   But Albracht said he believed the issue being discussed _ a
psychotherapist's privilege with his patients _ could not be
adequately divulged without disclosing the material claimed to be
privileged.
   The secret hearing dealt with tape recordings made by
psychiatrist Jerome Oziel, who treated Erik and Lyle Menendez.
   Gerald Chaleff, attorney for Lyle Menendez, had asked that the
hearing be held in secret on grounds that it could not be held in
public without violating the psychotherapist's privilege.

   An Austrian tourist died and her husband
was missing after a chartered yacht collided Saturday with a
freighter and sank in the Aegean Sea, an official said.
   It was unclear what caused the accident off Cape Sounion, 45
miles southeast of Athens, said a spokesman for the Merchant Marine
Ministry.
   The dead woman was identified as Susanne Sagl, 57, and her
husband as Hubert Sagl, 59, the ministry spokesman said on condition
of anonymity. No information was available about the couple's
hometown, he said.
   ``We have launched a full-scale search operation by air and sea
but there are no signs of the man so far,'' the spokesman said.
   A passing cruise ship ferried the injured to Lavrion, a port near
the site of the collision, and the remaining passengers and crew
arrived later aboard the Anastassia K., an official at a Lavrion
hospital said.
   The cause of Mrs. Sagl's death was not immediately clear, the
official said on condition of anonymity. He said it appeared the
yacht's mast might have struck her as the boat keeled over.
   The couple was traveling aboard the Greek Aghena yacht, which was
carrying a crew of four and 20 West German and three Austrian
tourists.
   Two other passengers were slightly injured when the yacht
collided with the Anastassia K. freighter, the spokesman said. It
was not clear how many crew members were aboard the freighter, but
all were reported safe, he said.
   The Aghena had left Piraeus, near Athens, and was heading for the
central Aegean island of Seriphos, part of the Kyklades island chain.
   The Anastassia K. was heading for Piraeus from the southeastern
Aegean island of Rhodes, charting a course contrary to that of the
yacht, the ministry spokesman said.

   President F.W. de Klerk freed
48 political prisoners Saturday in his latest effort aimed at
improving the climate for black-white political negotiations.
   In an announcement Thursday, De Klerk had promised the releases
and lifted the 4-year-old national state of emergency in three of
four provinces.
   The African National Congress, the country's leading opposition
group, welcomed the move, but said more than 3,000 activists remain
imprisoned for politically motivated acts.
   ``We are happy to be released,'' said Jeffrey Radebe. ``But our
happiness is not complete today when we think of all the comrades we
left behind.''
   Radebe, like most of the activists released Saturday, belongs to
the ANC. Several were convicted in some of the country's most highly
publicized terrorism and treason trials in recent years.
   Maj. Dave Smith, a spokesmen for the Prisons Service, said 28
inmates were released from the Robben Island Prison off Cape Town
and 20 more were freed from other prisons.
   One of the men released, Stephen Nkosi, said he thought the 48
were freed as a publicity move to ``undercut'' the current
international tour by African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   Mandela is on a six-week tour of Europe, North America and Africa
to urge foreign governments to maintain economic sanctions against
South Africa to protest apartheid.
   Speaking in Geneva Saturday, Mandela said non-whites in South
Africa face the same discrimination as when he was imprisoned 27
years ago. He urged the international community to continue its
pressure against apartheid.
   ``The fact that he (de Klerk) has declared he wants a non-racial
constitution does not mean apartheid has come to an end,'' said
Mandela, who was freed from prison in February.
   In Brussels, the European Community welcomed the lifting of
emergency rules, but did it not mention whether the 12-member
trading bloc would lift its sanctions against Pretoria.
   The EC in 1986 banned imports of iron, steel and gold coins from
South Africa and prohibited new EC investments in that country.
Britain unilaterally lifted the investment ban after Mandela's
release.
   Nkosi had been sentenced to 16 years in 1977 for what he
described as ``ANC-related activities.'' He was among 28 men freed
from Robben Island, where many prisoners went on a hunger strike
earlier this year demanding their release.
   Ashraf Karriem, convicted in 1988 along with several others at a
terrorism trial, hugged his ailing father at a tearful reunion in
Cape Town.
   ``I've been praying for this day, I can die now,'' said the
father Abdulrahman Karriem, 63.
   The ANC, the country's most powerful opposition group, has set
lifting the state of emergency, releasing political prisoners and
allowing the return of exiles were preconditions for black-white
negotiations on ending apartheid.
   De Klerk says he wants to work out a new constitution with the
opposition that will allow the country's 5 million whites to share
power with the 28 million blacks, who currently have no voice in
national affairs.
   Mid-level officials from the ANC and the government worked
together last month to put together a report on several issues
dividing the two sides, including the definition of a ``political
prisoner.''
   Also on Thursday, De Klerk said he would work toward allowing
thousands of exiles to return. Mandela says 20,000 people currently
live in exile.
   In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Thorvald
Stoltenberg, said Saturday his agency would be ready to help
repatriate political exiles once the ANC and the South African
government reach agreement on their return.
   Meanwhile, a U.N. envoy heading a fact-finding mission to South
Africa to determine the progress of reforms rejected a charge
Saturday that he was interfering in the country's affairs.
   ``The question of apartheid is an international issue, the
question of negotiations is very much a national issue,'' U.N.
Under-Secretary Abdul Rahim Fahran said Saturday. His six-member
team will spend 11 days in South Africa.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha warned the United Nations this week
not to interfere in South Africa's affairs. The warning reportedly
came in a letter to U.N. secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar.

   Palestinian in the occupied territories marked
2{ years of revolt against Israel Saturday with a general strike,
and Arab reports said two Palestinians suspected of collaborating
with Israel were slain.
   The new hard-line Cabinet of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir faces
confirmation in Parliament on Monday, but Israel radio reported that
women in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc threatened to disrupt a
Likud meeting to approve the Cabinet lineup Sunday.
   In an interview broadcast on Israel radio Saturday, Shamir said
he will seek contacts with the United States ``with more vigor.''
   Relations with Washington have worsened recently while Shamir's
interim government continued to reject a U.S. peace initiative and
settle Soviet Jews in the occupied territories.
   Palestinians throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
observed a general strike called by the pro-PLO underground leaders
to mark ``the monthly anniversary for the uprising,'' a leaflet
distributed in the territories said.
   Across the occupied lands, merchants closed their shops, public
transportation was halted and children stayed home from school.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, Arab reporters said three masked
men stabbed Jemal Abu Aziz, 29, with daggers and shot him to death
near the el Faruk mosque.
   Residents said Aziz was known to work with Israeli security
forces and that his body was taken away by the authorities, Arab
reporters said.
   The army said it was a criminal matter and under police
investigaton.
   In Jerusalem, police said they found the body of another
Palestinian man stabbed overnight. Arab reporters identified the
victim as Hamad Hamdan and said he had been accused of organizing
the sale of Arab lands to Jewish settlers.
   Their deaths brought to 221 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs since the uprising began in December 1987. Most were
killed on suspicion of collaborating with Israel or drug dealing or
prostitution.
   A total of 716 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops
and civilians, and 45 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Shamir faced a new threat when women members of the governing
Likud Central Committee said they would distrupt Sunday's meeting,
scheduled to confirm Shamir's new Cabinet, Israel radio said.
   It said 400 women planned to protest unless at least one female
minister was appointed to the Cabinet. Ultra-Orthodox religious
parties have opposed serving on a Cabinet with women.
   Shamir said on Israel radio that he hoped his new government
would ``work with a united spirit without too many differences among
its members.''
   He said it was too early to consider a trip to Washington since
his government had not been approved by the Knesset, or parliament.
But, he said, he would pursue greater contact with the Americans.
   Israel television said contacts with the U.S. administration had
``practically been cut off'' since the national unity government,
which included the center-left Labor Party led by Shimon Peres, fell
apart on March 15.
   Shamir lost a vote of confidence then when Likud rejected
left-of-center Labor's demand to accept a proposal by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III for preliminary peace talks with
Palestinians.
   According to its guidelines, Shamir's new government promises to
maintain its May 1989 peace initiative promising Palestinian
elections.
   At the same time, the new government has pledged to expand
settlements in the occupied lands and use harsh measures against the
Palestinian revolt.
   With his delicate, two-seat majority in the 120-member
Parliament, Shamir also faces the possiblilty of collapse should his
right-wing partners reject his peace moves. Some of the partners
oppose autonomy for the Palestinians in the occupied territories.

<TEXT>
   A woman who is living in hiding while
police search for clues to the whereabouts of her fugitive
ex-husband says the system has failed her and other battered women.
   Janet Pearson fears for her life. Authorities say they can't
afford to give her around-the-clock protection from Marvin Pearson,
her former spouse, who is accused of kidnapping and terrorizing his
ex-wife and 13-year-old daughter with a sawed-off shotgun last
Christmas Eve, less than two weeks after being released from prison
after a previous threat.
   Pearson, 47, escaped May 25 from the Benton County Jail. He and
another inmate cut through a wire covering the jail's exercise area.
The other inmate surrendered the next morning, but Pearson has not
been spotted since his escape.
   ``If he can find me, I know he will kill me,'' Ms. Pearson, 41,
said Friday before leaving the Fayetteville Battered Women's Shelter
for another, perhaps safer, place to live.
   ``I have no protection, no freedom, and none of it is my fault,''
she said. ``The laws are such that a battered woman has no place to
turn. I'm in danger and everyone I associate with is in danger.''
   The leave she took from her job at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Fayetteville expires in a week. She has worked at the
hospital for 10 years but said she has no guarantee that the job
still will be open if and when police recapture her former husband
and she can come out of hiding.
   Ms. Pearson requested 24-hour police protection, but Benton
County Sheriff Andrew Lee said he could not oblige because of a
shortage of money and manpower.
   Pearson gained early release from the state Department of
Correction on Dec. 15 under the state's Emergency Powers Act, which
authorizes prison officials to hasten the parole of some eligible
prisoners to ease overcrowding.
   He had been sentenced to prison for a previous threat against Ms.
Pearson and was denied parole on July 1989.
   Neither his ex-wife nor Benton County authorities knew Pearson
was out of prison until he appeared Christmas Eve at Ms. Pearson's
mobile home near Lowell in rural Benton County and threatened to
kill her.
   After about 30 minutes, Pearson's daughter managed to call for
help. Pearson fled in a pickup, which he forced his wife to drive at
gunpoint. After a short chase, he abandoned the vehicle and managed
to elude officers who conducted a manhunt with dogs and helicopters.
Ms. Pearson was not injured.
   Gov. Bill Clinton criticized prison officials' decision on
Pearson's early release.
   Pearson later made threatening telephone calls to his ex-wife at
her job, where the telephones had been tapped. Authorities traced
the calls to Phoenix, Ariz., where FBI agents arrested Pearson on
Jan. 6.
   ``My life has been a living hell for the last three years. It
hasn't changed now, so what's going to hurt?'' Ms. Pearson said,
explaining why she agreed to talk to the news media about her
situation.
   ``Things can change for the better only when people speak up when
their rights are being violated and their needs aren't being
addressed,'' she said.

   Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin on
Saturday promised to improve the economy in the Soviet Union's
largest republic within three years but warned the situation was so
tense that ``any spark ... could create a fire.''
   The unsual 20-minute interview with the newly elected head of the
Russian republic was broadcast on state TV the same day it was
announced that several Yeltsin allies lost first-round elections to
Russia's new legislature.
   The silver-haired Yeltsin, 59, put aside his criticism of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and instead appealed for
consolidation.
   Referring to the sagging economy, Yeltsin said, ``We will find a
way out of the situation.'' But his offered few details of his plan.
   He appealed specifically to coal miners, who this summer will
mark the first anniversary of a strike that damaged the economy and
depleted the nation's coal supplies. Some miners want to renew the
walkout, and a decision could come at a miners' conference this week
in the Ukraine.
   ``I would like somehow to calm miners, who will soon mark the
anniversary of their strike, to (ask them to) refrain from
destabilizing further the situation in the Russian Federation,''
Yeltsin said.
   He said the situation ``is heated so much that any spark, any
irresponsible action or even a word, could create a fire.''
   The Soviet Union is plagued by ethnic strife among many of its
more than 100 nationalities, chronic shortages of consumer goods and
food, rampant crime and poverty.
   Yeltsin has appeared almost nightly on TV for the past few weeks
in broadcasts of proceedings from the Congress of People's Deputies
of the Russian Federation. But Saturday's interview was the first
time he was allowed a special broadcast to espouse his views.
   Yeltsin was elected president of the Russian Federation, which
comprises two-thirds of the country's territory and just over half
its population, last month.
   At his urging, the Russian Congress on Friday passed a
``Declaration of Sovereignty.'' It proclaims that Russian laws take
precedence over national legislation.
   In Saturday's interview, Yeltsin promised his economic reform
program would ``help our people to live better.'' Without giving
details, he said the program will hurt people less than the central
government's plan to raise prices starting July 1 in its transition
to a ``regulated market economy.''
   Turning from the interviewer seated across a glass-topped table
to look directly into the camera, he added, ``We need some credit of
faith, dear comrades, from you for two years, maybe a little more _
two or three years maximum _ to stabilize the situation and improve
generally the situation in the Russsian Federation.''
   And reassuring skeptics, he added, ``Such a program exists. It's
not just words.''
   Yeltsin, in the television interview recorded Thursday, said his
reformist forces have only a shaky majority and said he might have
to turn directly to the people if parliament failed to adopt his
radical measures.
   ``If there is a critical point of a lack of understanding, I will
appeal to the people,'' Yeltsin said.

   Balls of flame spewed Saturday from the
aft section of the burning supertanker Mega Borg, sending huge
columns of black smoke high over the Gulf of Mexico.
   The smoke was visible for some 40 miles, leaving a cloud
thousands of feet in the mostly sunny sky.
   From a helicopter above the scene, heat from the blaze was
intense and could be felt several hundred feet above the burning
ship. The air smelled of burning fuel.
   Three streams of water from a pair of fireboats appeared to have
little effect on the inferno. Two Coast Guard cutters cruised
nearby. A motorized rubber boat patrolled near the bow of the
burning ship.
   Two crewmen were confirmed dead in the 1 a.m. explosion and
authorities said two others were missing and presumed dead. Of the
crew of 41, 18 crew members were injured, none seriously, officials
said.
   The Coast Guard said the 853-foot Mega Borg was hauling about 38
million gallons of light crude oil when the blast occurred, 57 miles
southeast of Galveston.
   The fire continued to rage out of control Saturday afternoon, as
two fireboats sprayed jets of water on the flames.
   Fire poured from the tanker's stack and engulfed the aft section,
including the wheelhouse, accounting for about the back fifth of the
ship.
   Sections of the crew quarters that weren't in flames were charred
black. Blackened sections extended far up the walls and nearly to a
radar antenna.
   One fireboat, the Carolyn Chouest, was a few yards off the stern
of the Mega Borg, shooting two streams, one directly down the stack
and another in the flaming quarters on the starboard aft.
   A second, smaller fireboat was moored to the burning ship and
played a single stream into the flames.
   There was no sign of activity aboard the ship, which did not
appear to be listing. The rear section appeared somewhat lower in
the water than the rest of the maroon-colored vessel.
   There also was no evidence in the water around the ship that it
was leaking cargo.
   A small black oil slick could be seen to the left of the bow
continuing about one-third of the way along the water line. It did
not appear to be growing.
   The remains of a flag, now ragged and charred black, blew in the
wind off a mast on the stern of the ship.

   The country's first free election
in 44 years should have been a joyous celebration of democracy, but
it has been marred by the legacy of its Communist past.
   The charges and counter-charges over purported links between
People's Party Chairman Josef Bartoncik and the Communists are the
latest illustration of how the atmosphere of suspicion spawned by
decades of authoritarian rule can poison the climate of emerging
Eastern European democraties.
   In Bartoncik's case, opponents have charged he collaborated for
17 years with the Communists' dreaded STB secret police.
   He has denied wrongdoing. Interior Minister Richard Sacher, also
a member of the Bartoncik's non-Communist party, asserted Saturday
that no evidence has been presented to back up the accusations.
   Thousands of files listing STB informants were destroyed in the
aftermath of the peaceful November revolution that overturned
Communist domination. Bartoncik's accusers say documents relating to
Bartoncik appear to have been among them.
   But the staff of President Vaclav Havel asserts Bartoncik did not
deny his informer role when confronted by Havel, a former dissident
who enjoys unrivaled popularity because of his courageous defiance
of Communist authorities.
   Other leading government personalities associated with Havel's
Civic Forum political movement say Bartoncik figures on a list of
former STB informers.
   Civic Forum, which led the fight against Communist rule with its
sister party Public Against Violence, was founded by dissidents who
suffered most under the autocratic Marxists.
   The post-Communist government has announced the dismantling of
the secret police. However, fear and suspicion bred by decades of
persecution contribute to the search for past culprits.
   The increasingly acrimonious dispute pitting the two
anti-Communist parties could breed distrust for years to come.
   ``I have great doubts about the future development in this
country. It reminds me too much of the past years,'' said Jiri
Cerny, general-secretary of Bartoncik's party.
   In a protest to the National Electoral Commission, People's Party
leaders on Saturday claimed the timing of accusations against
Bartoncik violated a rule prohibiting campaigning 48 hours before
the voting, which began Friday and finished Saturday..
   They left open whether they would ask that the elections be
invalidated _ a move that would further tarnish Czechoslovakia's
democratic rebirth.
   Other East European nations have suffered similar problems as
they emerged from totalitarianism.
   In East Germany, Wolfgang Schnur, a top conservative candidate,
admitted four days before free elections March 18 that he had at one
time worked for the secret police. He then resigned.
   Ibrahim Boehme gave up his post as chairman of East Germany's
Social Democrats after unproven allegations he had also worked for
the ``Stasi'' secret police.
   The democratic climate is perhaps most poisoned in Romania, whose
swift and bloody December revolution left the Securitate secret
police formally in shambles but many of its personnel unscathed.
   The Communist Party also collapsed, but many of its former
functionaries are members of the new government. A protest of those
Communist links was in its 48th day Saturday in downtown Bucharest.
   Even in Hungary, where the ruling party voluntarily held
multiparty elections and agreed to yield power, the Communist legacy
has cast a long shadow.
   The biggest scandal in the weeks before the March elections were
revelations that surviving elements from the secret police were
spying on anti-Communist parties.

   People who spent two years trying to
lower their weight, fat, cholesterol, and blood pressure celebrated
the end of the wellness program on Saturday with a healthy brunch.
   The private project to improve rural Americans' cardiovascular
health resulted in an average 8.6-pound loss of body fat as well as
reduced cholesterol and blood pressure, organizers said.
   About 300 people gathered for the farewell meal of a lean turkey
sandwich, oat bran muffins, fruit, smoked salmon and asparagus.
   Results of a final health screening done late last month showed
that the 517 people who were in the program from start to finish saw
their cholesterol drop from 220.4 to 208.4, an average of 5.4
percent, according to program director Bill Reger.
   Average blood pressures fell from 131.5 over 81.3 to 126.2 over
78.3, Reger said. A blood pressure of 120 over 80 is considered
ideal, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   Participants also lost an average of 3.5 pounds in total weight
and 8.6 pounds of body fat, according to organizers.
   ``The media used to call us `fat city,''' said Reger. ``Now they
recognize that we're the state of the art of wellness.''
   Study participants were encouraged to follow a low-fat,
high-fiber diet, exercise and use stress-management techniques. Free
cooking and aerobics classes were offered along with lectures on
heart disease, nutrition and weight loss.
   Clinics also were offered to help smokers kick the habit.
   The study, begun in May 1988, was sponsored by The Bayer Co., and
Glenbrook Laboratories, the aspirin maker's New York-based parent.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Bayer President Richard F.
Gaccione offered their encouragement at Saturday's farewell brunch.
   Rockefeller said $600 billion is spent in the United States
annually on health care, with a large portion directly related to
unhealthy lifestyles.
   Gaccione presented a $30,000 grant to the newly created Brooke
County Wellness, Inc., a nonprofit corporation established to keep
the program going in the area. Rockefeller added a $1,000 donation.

   A mooring line snapped and injured five men,
one critically, as they were securing an oil tanker offshore
Saturday, said Coast Guard officials.
   The men were working on the 780-foot OMI Columbia just off the
coast of Marina Del Rey when the mooring line snapped, said
Elizabeth Neely, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
   ``A snapped mooring line has the recoil force of a fired
weapon,'' Neely said.
   A Coast Guard helicopter airlifted four of the men to Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center and another to a hospital in nearby Torrance, Neely
said.
   The critically injured man had a broken leg and head injuries,
officials said. His condition was later upgraded to stable and three
others were released from the hospital, said Sharon Ellis, nursing
supervisor at Harbor-UCLA. The condition of the fifth man was not
immediately available.
   None of the victims were identified.
   The ship was not damaged.

<TEXT>
   A former radio minister was allowed to
remain free without bail after pleading innocent to federal charges
of defrauding listeners who donated money for a youth camp.
   Troy Cecil Snowden, whose ``The Troy Snowden Ministry'' was
broadcast from October 1986 to 1988, is accused in a federal
indictment of fraudulently using his radio ministry to obtain
property and illegal sex with a minor.
   The indictment alleged that Snowden used his late-night call-in
show on radio station KAAY to solicit contributions to the Troy
Snowden Ministry and Lion of Judah Youth Ranch. The contributions
were received at a post office box in North Little Rock.
   The four-count indictment did not say how much money Snowden
allegedly defrauded from listeners.
   Snowden, 46, allegedly told listeners that contributions were to
be invested in the construction of a youh ranch in West Plains, Mo.
   He was arrested in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., on May 24, but has
been free on a $100,000 unsecured bond. U.S. Magistrate Henry L.
Jones Jr. allowed Snowden to remain free after Snowden entered his
plea Friday in U.S. District Court.
   Following his arrest, Snowden appeared before Jones, and said he
couldn't afford to hire a lawyer to defend him.
   ``I ain't got nothing now,'' he said when questioned about his
financial condition. ``I had a chance at some (money), but I was
arrested.''
   Jones appointed lawyer Marva Davis of Little Rock to represent
Snowden. Jones then accepted Snowden's innocent plea to the
indictment. A jury trial was set for July 9 with U.S. District Judge
Elsijane T. Roy presiding.
   The bond also stipulated that Snowden could have no contact with
the girl he was accused of taking from Jacksonville, Ark., to
Arizona and Hattiesburg, Miss., in early 1989 to engage in sexual
activity when she was 14.
   ``We originally asked for detention,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Lesa Jackson. She said the request was based on the risk
Snowden might leave the United States and his danger to the
community.
   Jackson, however, said the U.S. Justice Department had no
objection to Snowden's release on certain conditions. Among them
were that he be ordered to have no contact with about 10 other
people associated with the case, stay off the KAAY radio station
property in Little Rock and refrain from any additional fund raising.

   President Vaclav Havel and the
other dissidents who toppled the Communists late last year appeared
headed for a solid victory Saturday in the nation's first free
elections in 44 years.
   But a dispute over top politicians who allegedly worked for the
Communist secret police clouded the election euphoria.
   Havel's aides, at a nationally televised news conference, accused
a top Christian Democrat leader of working for the dreaded STB
secret police for 17 years.
   In a related development, a Havel ally and leader of the
anti-Communist revolution, Jan Budaj, announced at an emotional
evening news conference that he had worked for the secret police and
was quitting politics.
   The national election was essentially a contest between two
anti-Communist alliances: Civic Forum and its sister party, Public
Against Violence; and the Christian Democratic Union.
   Projections released 4{ hours after polls closed and based on
initial vote counts suggested that Havel's Civic Forum and Public
Against Violence, who together helped topple Communist rule, had won
about 50 percent of the votes in the federal parliament.
   The Christian Democrat Union, which may have been hurt by the
charges about its leader, had about 12 percent of the vote in both
chambers, running virtually neck and neck with the Communists.
   The People's Party, led by the accused man, Josef Bartoncik,
lodged a formal complaint that Havel's government violated election
laws by denouncing Bartoncik less than 48 hours before balloting
started. The People's Party is part of the Christian Democrat
Union's coalition.
   International observers monitoring voting on Friday and Saturday
did not say whether they believed the scandal violated election laws.
   The Czechoslovak commission overseeing the elections ruled that a
violation had occurred, but it was not clear what action would be
taken.
   Bartoncik was expected to win a seat in the new federal
Parliament, and the dispute over his background could become
important if the election results in a coalition government.
   In the Slovak capital of Bratislava, Budaj, a leader of Public
Against Violence, said he was pressured into signing a document in
1979 to cooperate with the secret police after trying to defect and
getting caught.
   The election was for a 300-seat, bicameral federal Parliament,
which will draft a new constitution removing the last vestiges of
Communist rule. The lawmakers also are expected to re-elect Havel to
a two-year term.
   Czechoslovaks also voted during the two-day election for regional
parliaments for the Czech and Slovak republics.
   Final results were not expected until Sunday.
   The Parliament is made up of the House of the People, whose 150
members ran at large nationwide, and the House of Nations, whose 150
members represent either the Czech or the Slovak republics.
   Other smaller parties were trying to win the 5 percent minimum
vote required to get seats under a system of proportional
representation.
   Top aides to Havel interrupted a nationally televised news
conference for the first TV broadcast of the initial projections.
   The aides beamed as the projections came through, and Havel's
spokesman, Michael Zantovsky, made a V-sign to applauding Czech
supporters.
   But the aides faced tough questions about their handling of the
Bartoncik affair.
   Allegations that Bartoncik was a secret police agent first
surfaced in May in the Austrian weekly Profil. It said he worked
under the code name ``Hajek'' and registration number 15301 in the
Moravian capital, Brno, where he was a top official of his party,
then allied with the Communists.
   Bartoncik denied any collaboration with the hated STB, or secret
police. His party colleague, Interior Minister Richard Sacher,
earlier had come under fire for alleged reluctance to investigate
secret police activities.
   Sacher's deputy, Jan Ruml, a Havel appointee and like the
president a former dissident, was then charged with investigating
STB operations.
   Ruml told Saturday's news conference that he had confirmed only
on Monday that Bartoncik's name was on a register of Brno secret
police agents.
   ``For 17 years, he was a paid adviser of the STB,'' said Havel
aide Jiri Krizan.
   Prosecutor Pavel Rychetsky said a former STB agent had come
forward independently to him on Tuesday and told him that the
information Bartoncik gathered was passed directly to former party
leader Milos Jakes.
   Bartoncik even infiltrated the dissident movement Charter 77,
Rychetsky said, building contacts with Vaclav Benda, now the leader
of the Czech Christian Democrats.
   Havel confronted Bartoncik with the information on Tuesday and
Bartoncik promised to quit politics, said Krizan, who was present at
the meeting.
   Bartoncik was hosptalized late Tuesday with a reported heart
attack, but issued no statement that he was relinquishing his
candidacy for parliament.
   More than 100 people from all parties did step down after
screening for links with the secret police, who Civic Forum says had
a network of 140,000 informers.
   Later Saturday, Havel broke away from the political disputes to
appear as the non-musical star of a concert to denounce racism.
   The president, who took the stage to welcome American singer Paul
Simon,was himself greeted by wild cheers of ``Long Live Havel!''
from a crowd of about 10,000 at the concert in Prague's historic Old
Town Square.
   Havel said the concert ``is even more special because it's taking
place on the day when after long decades we could again choose our
future.''

   Israeli-allied militiamen Saturday captured
three Palestinian guerrillas as they tried to infiltrate into
northern Israel, the army said.
   The military said a routine patrol of the South Lebanon Army
militia spotted the three-man squad moving towards Israel about 2
miles north of the border settlement of Misgav Am.
   The army said the guerrillas were Palestinians, but gave no other
details of their identities.
   The infiltration attempt was the first reported since the Israeli
army foiled an attempt by seaborne guerrillas from the Palestine
Liberation Front to land at a beachfront south of Tel Aviv on May 30.
   The Palestine group is a faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The United States is considering an end to its
dialogue with the PLO due to the failed raid.
   Also Saturday, the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia
killed a Lebanese man in the southern port city of Tyre accused of
collaborating with Israel.
   An Amal gunman shot 26-year-old Haidar al-Asmar as he sat on a
rock blindfolded with his hands and legs tied.
   More than 3,000 people watched the killing, local reporters said.
   Asmar was a Lebanese army soldier from the village of Yareen
inside Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern Lebanon.
   Amal sources said militiamen arrested Asmar on Tuesday after he
shot and seriously wounded a travel agent in Tyre.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Amal
militiamen chased Asmar and captured him 1,800 feet outside the
security zone.
   Israel carved out a two-to-10-mile wide buffer zone in southern
Lebanon in 1985 after it withdrew the bulk of its forces from
Lebanon following its 1982 invasion.
   About 3,000 South Lebanon Army militiamen, backed by about 1,000
Israeli troops, patrol the zone.

   A state security court adjourned until Sunday
the trial of the eldest son of the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser
and 19 others accused of attacks on U.S. and Israeli diplomats.
   Judge Emad el-Din Ismail of the state security court adjourned
Saturday's session after hearing an attorney defending the leader of
the group that claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   Ismail said he will continue to hear arguments from the defense
attorney Sunday.
   Two of the heads of the Egypt's Revolution group, Mahmoud Nour
el-Din el-Sayed Ali Suliman, and Khaled Gamal Abdel Nasser, a
40-year-old engineer and son of Egypt's former socialist president,
have been charged with leading the attacks.
   The two, along with nine other defendants, face the death penalty
if convicted.
   Khaled Nasser returned to Egypt on Wednesday and gave himself up
to police at Cairo International Airport, saying he intended to
prove himself innocent.
   Nasser and another 19 members of the Egypt's Revolution group are
accused of four terror attacks against Israeli and American
diplomats between 1984 and 1987. The attacks killed two Israelis and
wounded six Israelis and two Americans.

   Kerry Kennedy and Andrew Cuomo were married
Saturday in a ceremony that merged two of America's most powerful
political families.
   They swore mutual commitment to the oppressed _ ``the people who
have disappeared in El Salvador, the children in shelters in New
York.''
   The bride, 30, is the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and
is executive director the human rights center in New York City which
bears his name. The groom, 32, is the New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's
son and chief political adviser; he currently heads a Manhattan
foundation to help the homeless.
   The elaborate, closed wedding, attended by 300 people, was at the
Cathedral of St. Matthew, a Catholic church about a half-mile from
the White House and the one where President John F. Kennedy's
funeral was held in 1963. Kerry Kennedy, the late president's niece,
was just 3 years old when he was assassinated, just 8 when her
father was gunned down. She was the seventh of Robert and Ethel
Kennedy's children.
   The bride walked the aisle alone as the entire Kennedy clan,
including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and a planeload of Cuomo
relatives and intimates looked on.
   The guest list remained secret, but it included New York Mayor
David Dinkins, film maker Francis Ford Coppola, newspaper columnists
Jimmy Breslin and Art Buchwald and dozens of others who occupied a
swarm of photographers and hundreds of sightseers who lined the
sidewalk across from the church.
   Kerry Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, the groom's father, and
several brothers and sisters of both the bride and groom gave
readings during the wedding mass, celebrated by the Rev. Gerard C.
Creedon of County Cork, Ireland, a longtime Kennedy family friend
now performing Catholic charity work in nearby Alexandria, Va.
   Creedon said the couple affirmed a pledge to uphold ``family
traditions, and their commitment to human rights and justice.'' He
charged them in the ceremony, at their request, to always ``cherish
the people who have disappeared in El Salvador, the children in
shelters in New York.''
   Kerry Kennedy wore a Scaasi-designed dress of gleaming silk white
satin with a basque bodice, a sweetheart neckline, puff sleeves, a
voluminous skirt and a cathedral train. It was ornamented with
crystals, silver bugle beads and hearts of pearl. The groom and his
15-member party wore morning suits.
   The maids of honor were Kerry's younger sister, Rory, 21, and
friend Mary Richardson, 30. Sisters Courtney Kennedy and Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend were among 13 maids of honor.
   Andrew Cuomo's younger brother, Christopher, 19, was best man.
Ushers included brothers-in-law Kenneth Cole and Robert Perpignano,
and Kerry's brothers, Christopher, Douglas, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy
III, D-Mass., Max, Michael and Robert Jr.
   The bride carried a cascade of white roses, lisianthus,
stephinotis, gardenias, sweet peas and bouvardia. Her attendants
held bouquets of pink florabunda roses and sweet peas, and her
flower girls wore halos of baby roses.
   The coupled drew warm cheers and applause as they emerged from
the hour-plus ceremony. And cries of ``Jackie, Jackie, Jackie''
greeted John Kennedy's widow, dressed in an all-white business suit.
   A three-abreast, block-long flotilla of stretch limousines then
carried the wedding party and virtually all their guests to a
reception at Hickory Hill, the McLean, Va., home of Ethel Kennedy,
the bride's mother.
   The ceremony blended classical and African-American music, and
featured Ruth Brown, the star soloist of New York's ``Black and
Blue.''
   The wedding had been informally billed as the creation of
``Cuomolot,'' a successor to the fabled land of Camelot so revered
by John F. Kennedy. But friends and family alike pleaded for an
abatement of any political speculations.
   ``This isn't the Middle Ages where the Duke of Normandy and the
Duke of Avignon get together and decide on a marriage,'' said
William Cunningham, an adviser to Gov. Cuomo, a day earlier. ``This
is not a dynastic accomplishment, this is two people who decided to
get married.''
   But Frank Mankiewicz, former press secretary to Robert F.
Kennedy, wrying observed that if a new dynasty emerges, ``It's got
awful good bloodlines. It's like they say in baseball _ it's one of
those trades that helps both clubs.''
   Both Andrew Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo are law-school
graduates. They had dated for nearly two years before he offered her
a diamond ring last Valentine's day.
   She is graduate of Brown University and Boston College Law
School. He is a graduate of Fordham University and Albany Law School.
   Cuomo has worked for his father's political campaigns since he
was a teen-ager, and managed his gubernatorial victories in 1982 and
1986. He plans to run his father's campaign for re-election this
year as well.
   Following a six-day honeymoon in the Caribbean, the couple plans
to settle in Queens, N.Y. Andrew Cuomo's current office, as head of
HELP, the non-profit corporation to build temporary housing for the
homeless, is in Manhattan.
   Seven years ago, a family biographer asked Kerry Kennedy what she
hoped her life would be like in 10 years. She replied: ``I want to
be married and madly in love and have a million children. I want to
be working hard and my husband working hard and I want both of us to
be involved in something caring and constructive. Something we can
put our hearts and souls into.''

   Oil that spilled from a grounded tanker into
a busy shipping channel between New York City and New Jersey fouled
about four miles of city and national beaches Saturday, officials
said.
   Workers removed about 800 pounds of tar balls that began washing
up Friday night along 2\ miles of Midland Beach on the borough of
Staten Island, said James Cafaro, supervisor of city beaches on the
borough.
   The 260,000-gallon spill occurred Thursday morning when the
811-foot tanker BT Nautilus ran aground in the Kill Van Kull
waterway.
   At the Great Kills unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area,
which borders Midland Beach, an ``extensive washup'' of oil hit 1{
to 2 miles of beach, said Gateway spokesman Manny Strumpf.
   Both beaches remained open Saturday, spokesmen said.
   Tar balls were spotted as far away as Coney Island, about three
nautical miles from the spill site.
   Park rangers also removed 40 pounds of tar balls from a section
of beach at Breezy Point in Queens, another unit of Gateway, Strumpf
said.
   Gateway's other federal beach, Sandy Hook in New Jersey, has not
been affected, Strumpf said.
   The cleanup of the spill Saturday involved more than 420 workers,
skimming boats, vacuum trucks and about 80 other boats, officials
said.
   By Saturday morning, more than 10,000 gallons of the No. 6
heating oil had been recovered, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Paul A.
Milligan.
   Two Navy skimming boats arrived from Norfolk, Va., and worked the
adjacent Arthur Kill on Saturday, authorities said. Two sensitive
nesting areas in the vicinity, Pralls Island and Shooters Island,
had booms placed around them Thursday.
   A Coast Guard board of inquiry is to begin hearings Monday on the
grounding of the British-owned tanker and other incidents that since
the first of the year have dumped more than 1 million gallons of oil
into the waters of New York harbor, four times the amount spilled
last year, the Coast Guard said.
   Separate investigations by the Coast Guard, New Jersey and New
York are under way. The first mate of the BT Nautilus, Geoffrey
Frederick Gregory of England, was charged Thursday by New Jersey
authorities with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol
or drugs.
   The Kill Van Kull could be reopened to shipping on Sunday, said
Milligan. The waterway was closed after the grounding and was
reopened on a case-by-case basis Friday afternoon.
   Three dead birds have been found, the Coast Guard said.
   A cleaning station established in Bayonne by Toms River Avian, a
volunteer rescue group, has treated some birds, said John Hagerty, a
spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, but
he could not provide numbers.
   ``They are saying the impact on the avian population is
minimal,'' said Hagerty. ``We're in a migratory period so there
aren't that many birds in the area.''

<TEXT>
   The presidential candidate voters choose Sunday
to lead Peru through the next five years will inherit a violent,
bankrupt country many people believe is ungovernable.
   Whatever the campaign promises, long-brewing crises will make it
difficult just to maintain current levels of poverty and popular
discontent.
   On the eve of the election, Maoist Shining Path guerrillas called
``armed strikes'' in four important cities in the Andean highlands
and the eastern jungle region to block the voting. The call, issued
in pamphlets, crudely painted wall posters and messages to radio
station, carried with it the threat of violence against those
disobeying the order to boycott the election.
   Those voting will decide between novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, a
conservative champion of free markets, and Alberto Fujimori, the son
of Japanese immigrants, who was an obscure agricultural engineer
when the presidential campaign began.
   Fujimori, 51, and Vargas Llosa, 54, were in a dead heat in the
runoff election, according to independent polls released Friday. By
law President Alan Garcia can't run for a consecutive five-year term.
   ``It's a fallacy to say this country is ungovernable,'' Fujimori,
an independent, said in an interview. ``The country is governable,
but the political parties have demonstrated they're incapable of
governing.''
   About 10 million of the 22 million Peruvians are eligible to
vote, and are required by law to do so. Polls will be open from 8
a.m. to 3 p.m. If it is a close contest, as expected, the result may
not be known for weeks because of poor communications with isolated
mountain and jungle towns.
   The runoff was required after no candidate received a majority in
the first round of balloting April 8.
   The winner is to take office July 28. Among his problems will be:
   _Annual inflation of 2,000 percent. The inti, worth 7 cents when
it was introduced in 1986, has shrunk to less than two-thousandths
of a penny. Wages have lost 50 percent of their purchasing power in
the past two years.
   _Two leftist insurgencies. Political violence takes nine lives a
day and at least 18,500 have been killed in the last decade. The
economic damage is more than $15 billion, rebels control large parts
of the interior and one-third of Peru is under military control.
   _A foreign debt of $20 billion, the highest per capita in South
America. International agencies stopped credit when Peru ceased
making payments on the debt in 1986, and several foreign banks are
suing. The treasury is more than $100 million in the red.
   _Labor and public unrest. Street sweepers, prison inmates, even
hospital patients hold strikes and protests for higher pay and
better services. Four of five Peruvians lack regular employment.
   _Drug trafficking. Peru is the largest producer of coca leaf, the
raw material of cocaine, and more than 200,000 Peruvians make their
living from it. The international crackdown on trafficking has cut
into the $1 billion the country earns annually from the trade, and
the United States is pressing Peru to accept military aid in
fighting coca production.
   _Destroyed or worn-out public facilities. Major highways are
crumbling for lack of maintenance, crippling the transport of
produce from farms in the interior. Guerrillas blow up bridges and
power lines. Power and water rationing hamper industrial production.
   Natural disasters have done their share of damage.
   An earthquake devastated towns in the northern jungle last month,
and a volcano in the southern Andes is threatening to erupt.
   Scientists have detected the beginnings of an El Nino phenomenon,
unusually warm ocean currents that disrupt weather patterns. A 1982
El Nino ruined crops and nearly destroyed the important fishing
industry.
   A recent Rand Corp. study financed partly by the U.S. State
Department said a military takeover was imminent.
   ``Conditions will become much worse before they get better,'' it
said. ``The real question is not whether there will be a coup, but
when.''
   The general belief in Peru appears to be that a Fujimori victory
would be more likely to provoke a coup because of his economic
plans. Critics say they differ little from the populist measures of
President Garcia.
   Among Fujimori's stated goals are reducing annual inflation to
less than 100 percent by the end of his first year. He advocates
maintaining controls on the economy, which Vargas Llosa blames for
Peru's economic decline, and says he will replace the inti with a
new currency.
   Fujimori proposes allowing prices for subsidized goods and
services to reach market levels, but then would freeze wages and
prices for six months. He also promises to reach agreement with
foreign lenders on new credits.
   He has rejected help from the U.S. military with the anti-drug
campaign and proposes to wean farmers from coca by stimulating
production of legal crops.
   Vargas Llosa's inflation goal is 10 percent within a year, and he
wants fundamental changes in the economy based on free-market
principles.
   The novelist would reduce the huge bureaucracy by ``shifting''
tens of thousands of workers to the private sector. He proposes
lifting price controls, selling state enterprises and changing labor
laws to allow companies to fire unproductive workers.

<TEXT>
   Presided over by its eldest members,
Romania's first freely-elected Parliament in more than half a
century met Saturday in buildings once used by ousted Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The 119-member Senate, which met in Omnia Hall in downtown
Bucharest, and the 396-member Chamber of Deputies, which met at the
Parliament building about a mile away, both agreed on preliminary
rules of procedure.
   Outside Parliament, some 300 anti-government demonstrators
chanted ``Down with Communism!'' and demanded the resignation of
President-elect Ion Iliescu, who won a landslide victory in
Romania's May 20 elections.
   Inside the Senate, legislator Cezar Buda said: ``This first
working day of the Senate is to us all a historic moment indeed.''
Buda, who at 82 was the oldest senator, was chosen to preside over
the inaugural meeting. He is from the opposition National Liberal
Party.
   He said the first task of the two-chamber Parliament was to draft
a new constitution.
   In the lower chamber, Rene-Radu Policrat, also a Liberal and at
80 the oldest deputy, said: ``We are again masters of our destinies
now ... Out of all dictatorships, the dictatorship that could rule
would be the dictatorship of liberty.''
   The Provisional Council, established after December's revolution
that toppled Ceausescu, passed an electoral law abolishing Romania's
unicameral legislator and instituted the two-house Parliament that
was first adopted by the nation in 1886.
   Iliescu's National Salvation Front, a broad coalition of workers,
peasants and technocrats, won two-thirds of the seats in the Chamber
of Deputies and about 77 percent of the Senate in the May 20
election. The Hungarian Democratic Party is the largest opposition
party followed by the Liberals.
   Of Romania's 119 senators, as many as 115 were present at the
meeting in Omnia Hall, which was once used to host the Communist
Party's plenary meetings.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students and dissidents fought
riot police Saturday in street battles around Seoul and the southern
city of Kwangju during demonstrations to demand broader democratic
reform.
   Radical groups had called for nationwide protests against the
government of President Roh Tae-woo in Seoul and 17 other cities
this weekend to mark the anniversary of 1987 pro-democracy protests.
   However, that call went largely unheeded Saturday. Radicals vowed
to stage more protests in 18 cities Sunday.
   In 1987, the nationwide popular protests reached their peak on
June 10 as tens of thousands of students and other South Koreans
rose up against the dictatorial President Chun Doo-hwan, demanding
democratic reform.
   Chun finally agreed to hold the country's first direct
presidential elections later that year. Roh won as the government
candidate.
   He has since introduced widespread democratic reform, including
greater press freedom, but critics say he has not done enough. Roh's
popularity has declined recently, but most South Koreans also shun
the radicals because of their violent tactics.
   On Saturday, about half the country's 130,000-member national
police force was mobilized to block protests, officials said.
   In Seoul, about 2,000 students, in groups ranging from 200 to
500, clashed with police at at least five different places, hurling
rocks and firebombs. Police fired tear gas to break up the
protesters.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' demonstrators shouted, charging that the
general-turned-president was backtracking on his promise of reform.
   ``Disband the DLP!'' protesters also chanted, accusing Roh's
governing Democratic Liberal Party of scheming to prolong what they
called ``dictatorial power.''
   The party, formed through a merger of Roh's old governing party
with two centrist opposition groups, has become a main target of
student protests. Students say the consolidated party will stifle
democracy.
   In southern Seoul, police fired tear gas to disperse about 200
members of a leading dissident group, the National Democratic
Alliance, who were trying to demonstrate near Kuro Industrial
Complex.
   Police arrested about 50 people, including Chang Ki-pyo, chief
organizer of the alliance.
   In the southern opposition stronghold of Kwangju, 150 miles south
of Seoul, about 300 radical students attacked a district office of
Roh's party with firebombs, the Yonhap news agency said.
   The students fled when police moved in with tear gas, the agency
said.
   No injuries were reported in the clashes.

<TEXT>
   A head-on collision between a freight train
and a large rail-maintenance unit caused a spectacular fire, more
than $500,000 in damage and the 12-hour shutdown of an Amtrak
passenger route, officials said.
   Braking problems on a rail grinder, a heavy unit about two
locomotives long that was being operated by a contractor, apparently
led to the accident Friday evening, Howard Kallio of Burlington
Northern Railroad said Saturday.
   All three locomotives and some of the approximately 35 cars on
the freight train were destroyed, Kallio said. He estimated damage
at $530,000 to the engines, cars and tracks.
   Firefighters battled flames that sent up a column of smoke
visible five miles. Four workers suffered minor injuries in the
crash, hospital officials said.
   The eastbound freight train was traveling about 50 mph when the
collision occurred, while the rail grinder pulling 10 cars was
westbound at about 20 mph, Kallio said.
   They crashed when the rail grinder failed to stop before a point
where two sets of track converge, he said.
   Crew members were given urinalysis tests as required under
federal law, but ``it appears that (the grinder) must have lost some
braking capacity,'' he said.
   Kallio said he did not know the extent of damage to the rail
grinder, used once or twice a year on heavily traveled tracks to
remove rough spots from the top and sides of the rails.
   Passengers from two trains _ one westbound and one eastbound _
were bused between Wenatchee and Spokane before the tracks were
reopened between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. Saturday, he said. About 20
residents were evacuated briefly from homes about a mile from the
crash site.

   Fourteen of 19 Old Masters paintings stolen from
a gallery more than two years ago in what police said was the city's
largest art theft have been recovered, the gallery's director said.
   No one has been arrested in the $6 million burglary, Nicholas
Hall, director of the Colnaghi USA Ltd. gallery on Manhattan's Upper
East Side, said Friday.
   He refused to provide further details, saying the case remained
open.
   The 14 paintings were recovered Monday, Hall said. Nine Old
Masters drawings that were also stolen have not been recovered.
   The most valuable pieces recovered were two 15-by-7-inch wood
panels by the 15th century Italian Renaissance master Fra Angelico,
Hall said. The panels, depicting saints, were worth a combined $4
million.
   ``One is talking about one of the crucial artists of the early
Florentine Renaissance,'' Hall said. He said the number of works by
Fra Angelico outside Italy is extremely small.
   Hall said the recovered panels appeared to be in good condition.
``Only cosmetic work will be needed to fix them,'' he said.
   The paintings and drawings were taken on Feb. 8, 1988, by thieves
who broke in through a skylight in the gallery on the Upper East
Side.

<TEXT>
   The government and rebels who have been
closing in on the capital have agreed to attend peace talks mediated
by the Liberian Council of Churches, the government and rebels said
Saturday.
   However, there was no cease-fire reported in the country's civil
war.
   The church council also has asked the United States to send
troops to Liberia as a peacekeeping force, council president Levee
Moulton said. A U.S. official late Saturday said he had no
information on such a request.
   The United States has refused President Samuel Doe's request for
military assistance, saying Marines would be sent in only if
hostilities reach the capital and endanger Americans. It has four
warships with 2,100 Marines stationed off the coast.
   The rebels, led by former bureaucrat Charles Taylor, had
consistently refused to negotiate unless Doe resigns and leaves
Liberia. But a rebel spokesman, Eric Dukaleu, in a telephone
interview late Saturday from the Ivory Coast city of Man, near the
border with Liberia, said the rebels would attend.
   A government source, who declined to be identified further, said
the peace talks will begin Monday at the U.S. Embassy in Freetown in
neighboring Sierra Leone. Government radio confirmed Doe had agreed
to send a delegation.
   A statement issued by the church council made no mention of the
cease-fire it has been calling for in the 5-month-old tribal war
that has killed more than 1,000 people, mostly civilians.
   No major fighting had been reported since Friday, when the
government recaptured a rubber plantation 25 miles southwest of the
capital. But the rebels maintained control of most of this
Ohio-sized nation of 2.5 million West Africa.
   The rebels accuse Doe's administration of corruption, economic
mismanagement and human rights abuses. Doe seized power in a bloody
coup in 1980.
   A U.S.-arranged evacuation of Americans and other expatriates was
scheduled for Sunday. An Air Guinea Boeing 737 was to make three
trips from Monrovia to Abidjan, capital of neighboring Ivory Coast.
   Embassy officials said it appeared the vast majority of the
nearly 1,500 Americans estimated to be in Liberia planned to stay.
U.S. and British naval ships remained off the Liberian coast in case
hostilities reached the capital and an emergency evacuation was
necessary.
   Doe this week agreed to let Liberian religious leaders mediate
the conflict.
   Moulton said the United States has been relaying messages between
the church group and Taylor, who was educated in the United States.
   The council's request for American peacekeeping troops had been
passed on to Washington, Moulton said. ``We are hoping for a
positive response,'' he said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Dave Denny said he had
no information on any such request.
   However, he read a statement expressing support for the peace
effort. ``In our contacts with the government and the (rebel)
Patriotic Front, we have urged them to negotiate a political
settlement to the conflict to avoid further bloodshed.''
   The church council statement said the government delegation to
the peace talks will include Information Minister Emmanuel Bowier,
Senate President Tambakai Jangaba and Deputy Foreign Minister Elbert
Dunn. The statement did not identify the rebel delegation.
   The church group said its delegation would include Lutheran
Bishop Ronald Diggs, Roman Catholic Archbishop Michael Francis and
the Rev. Moulton, a Baptist.
   Government officials said troops had recaptured Harbel, where the
U.S.-managed Firestone rubber plantation is located, after rebels
took it earlier in the week.
   Rebel sources confirmed their forces had withdrawn from the
plantation, which adjoins the country's international airport.
   The 120,000-acre rubber plantation, the world's largest, is
operated by Bridgestone-Firestone Inc., an Akron, Ohio-based
subsidiary of Japan's Bridgestone company.
   Government forces have been accused of killing hundreds of
members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which are believed to support
the rebels. The insurgents have been charged with killing many Krahn
and Mandingo people, considered loyal to Doe, in revenge. Doe is a
Krahn.
   Taylor began his insurgency Dec. 24, when a band of followers
entered Liberia from Ivory Coast.
   His forces steadily advanced through the first four months of the
war, pushing south toward the capital. The fighting sent more than
300,000 refugees fleeing to Monrovia and the countries of Ivory
Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
   Rebels captured the country's main iron ore mining installations
and its chief port, Buchanan, 95 miles by road southeast of Monrovia.
   The U.S. warships off the coast will help only in an emergency
evacuation, officials have said. The United States also has agreed
to evacuate other foreign nationals.
   Liberia was founded in 1822 by descendants of freed American
slaves and it became black Africa's first independent country in
1847.

   Masked youths went on a rampage Saturday during a
leftist protest march, smashing windows of banks, offices and a
restaurant where right-wing extremists recently celebrated Adolf
Hitler's birthday.
   No arrests or injuries were reported.
   The march was organized by a coalition of leftist groups to
demand cancellation of the Third World's foreign debt and to protest
racism.
   Police said about 2,000 people participated, but organizers
claimed a turnout of 10,000.
   Witnesses said the youths who caused the trouble did not appear
to be part of the main body of marchers.
   Their first target was Chez Jenny, a restaurant at the Place de
la Republique where far-right groups have held several meetings over
the years. They met there in April to mark the 101st anniversary of
Hitler's birth.

   Leaders of the National Rifle Association
assured members Saturday that recent legislative setbacks and
declining membership won't weaken their determination to protect gun
owners' interests.
   ``They say we must compromise. Our opponents define compromise as
`We taketh, you giveth.' This is not compromise my friends. That is
surrender,'' NRA First Vice President Richard D. Riley told the
group's annual convention.
   The remarks drew applause from more than 1,000 members attending
the second day of the three-day event at the Anaheim Convention
Center.
   The convention comes at a crucial time in the NRA's history. Once
considered politically invincible, the gun lobby has recently lost
legislative battles in New Jersey, Maryland and California.
   Earlier this month, the NRA suffered one of its worst defeats
when the U.S. Senate narrowly passed a ban on some assault rifles as
part of an omnibus crime bill. The NRA rebounded by helping spark a
filibuster on the bill, but both Democrats and Republicans said a
compromise is still possible.
   The NRA also has lost an estimated 250,000 members over the last
four years, and some of those remaining have either grumbled that
the group has failed to work hard enough or has lost touch with the
rank and file, overwhelmingly hunters and gun collectors.
   But Saturday's speeches signaled that the NRA, which still has
2.8 million members, will take a hard line rather than soften its
position on handgun purchase waiting periods and assault rifle bans.
   Leaders called on members to stop bickering and mount a unified
attack against what they described as misinformed media, liberal
police chiefs and overly soft NRA members.
   Members agreed that the group must continue to fight. They said
they fear that today's legislation banning assault rifles could be
tomorrow's ban on the kinds of guns most NRA members actually have.
   ``It's just a matter of time that the next gun they'll be after
is the shotgun,'' said William E. Smith of Owensboro, Ky.
   About 20,000 members of the 119-year-old organization and
thousands of nonmembers came to the convention. In addition to
speeches and workshops, there were vendors hawking everything from
sunglasses to hunting rifles.
   Outgoing NRA President Joe Foss acknowledged in a speech that
recent months have been difficult, but said the group is far from
dead.
   ``We haven't lost everything,'' he said. ``What we've lost are
some battles, but we'll win the war before it's all over with.''

   Two sets of Blues Brothers suits brought $12,000
and a red satin jacket embroidered ``John'' fetched $1,400 Saturday
at the John Belushi Memorial Auction.
   As a warm-up for the four-hour event, auctioneer Leslie Hindman
offered a signed copy of ``Samurai Widow,'' a book by Judy Jacklin
Belushi about the aftermath of her husband's death, and got $80 from
among the audience of about 250 at a downtown auction house. The
book retails for $21.95.
   ``If the whole sale goes like that, the charities will be
delighted,'' Ms. Hindman said.
   It did, and they were.
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Mrs. Belushi, who donated all the items
auctioned and estimated the event raised more than $100,000 for
charity. ``I'm very happy.''
   ``We underestimated virtually everything,'' said her fiance,
movie producer Victor Pisano. ``It's unbelievable. We thought we
might get $25,000.''
   Belushi, a Chicago native, died of a drug overdose on March 5,
1982, at age 33. He was a favorite on NBC-TV's ``Saturday Night
Live,'' and appeared in several movies, including ``The Blues
Brothers,'' ``Continental Divide'' and ``Animal House.''
   Pisano and Mrs. Belushi organized the auction to benefit the John
Belushi Memorial Foundation, which will help aspiring actors in
Chicago. The scholarship fund will be administered through the
Chicago comedy troupe Second City, where the comedian got his start.
   One bidder, identifying himself only as ``Planet Hollywood, a
dedicated follower of John Belushi,'' bid by telephone, and paid
$12,000 for two complete suit sets worn by Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
in ``The Blues Brothers.'' The bidder also paid thousands of dollars
for various Blues Brothers paraphernalia and a red satin ``Second
City'' jacket embroidered ``John.''
   A 1965 Volvo owned by Belushi also was sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder, for $4,000.

   Judy Garland's hometown honored the
late actress Saturday with a parade that featured 13 Munchkins from
the classic movie ``The Wizard of Oz'' and drew thousands of people.
   Under sunny skies, the Munchkins waved from a float in the design
of a rainbow as high school bands played ``Somewhere Over the
Rainbow,'' one of the memorable songs from the 1939 film.
   ``The weather broke right for Judy Garland's birthday,'' said
John Kelsch, coordinator of the Judy Garland Festival in this
northern Minnesota town of 8,000 people.
   Garland, who died in 1969, would have been 68 on Sunday.
   Margaret Pellegrini, who played one of the diminutive Munchkins
in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' said she had fond memories of the movie and
Garland.
   ``She was a great teen-ager,'' said the 66-year-old Glendale,
Ariz., woman. ``Nobody had any idea when we were filming it that it
would be such a classic.''
   Lewis Croft, 71, of Shelley, Idaho, said he enjoyed reminiscing
with his fellow former Munchkins.
   ``This is the first time I am seeing some of them, and it's
great,'' Croft said.
   The festival continues through Tuesday. Other activities include
a Judy Garland film festival and the opening of a museum featuring
Garland memorabilia.

<HEAD>Mexico, El Salvador Sign Pacts Easing 10 Years of Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUAN MALTES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and El Salvador signed economic and
cultural agreements Saturday in efforts to ease nearly 10 years of
tension between the two governments over the Salvadoran civil war.
   The agreements restructure El Salvador's $77 million debt with
Mexico and increase Mexican oil shipments to the Central American
country by 50 percent.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani told a news conference
that El Salvador is behind in debt payments but gave few details on
the restructuring program.
   He did say, however, the negotiations involve more Mexican
investments in El Salvador.
   The increase in oil sales from 8,000 to 12,000 barrels a day
comes under a 1981 pact under which Mexico and Venezuela sell oil to
countries in the region at low interest with long-term credit.
   Other agreements that were signed Saturday cover cooperation in
education, industrial development and radio and television.
   Relations between the two countries have been strained since
1980, when Mexico withdrew its ambassador to protest the killing of
a Mexican journalist. In 1981, Mexico and France signed a joint
declaration recognizing the leftist rebels in El Salvador as a
political force.
   Mexico did not return its ambassador to San Salvador until 1985.
   The guerrillas continue to maintain a political office in Mexico
and their leaders hold frequent news conferences in Mexico City.
   At a news conference, Cristiani said he was optimistic that a
peace agreement ending the 10-year-old civil war in his country
would be signed with the guerrillas by the end of this year.
   ``We believe that before September a cease-fire can be signed and
that in the following months a lasting peace can be signed with the
integration of the FMLN into the political life of the country as a
political party and with full guarantees,'' he said.
   The FMLN is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
umbrella group for five guerrilla factions fighting to overthrow the
U.S.-backed government.
   Cristiani said the army could be reduced with the signing of a
peace accord.
   ``If that is achieved, our army definitely will be able to be
reduced considerably and the armed forces will be dedicated
exclusively to safeguarding the integrity and sovereignty of El
Salvador,'' he said.
   He did not indicate how many of the nation's 54,000 government
troops could be demobilized.
   The government and guerrillas renewed talks in April, agreeing on
an agenda for negotiations.
   More than 71,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
in the war between leftist guerrillas and a succession of
U.S.-backed governments.

   In Saturday's competition, the
contestants were better off without fire in the belly.
   The contestants: Battle Creek and Springfield, Mass. The weapons:
flapjacks, cereal, doughnut holes, Pop Tarts, coffee, milk and
orange drink. The final score: Battle Creek 38,753, Springfield
37,380.
   It was sweet revenge for the ``Cereal City,'' which reclaimed its
crown Saturday after coming up empty in last year's annual breakfast
battle. The victory was especially impressive since Springfield's
population of 150,000 is almost three times Battle Creek's.
   ``It was a fantastic day; it was great,'' organizer Rick Royal
said after 500 volunteers dished out 38,753 portions. The food was
served for 3{ hours from a 2,500 foot-long table.
   ``It was an incredible effort for a town our size,'' Royal said.
   Battle Creek lost its title for the first time last year when
Springfield, fed pancakes to 33,869 hungry residents, outdoing
Battle Creek by 1,013 breakfasts.
   Royal, however, had a perfect alibi for last year's loss. In
1989, it was cold and rainy. This year, skies were sunny and
temperatures high.
   Battle Creek is the home of Kellogg Co., Post and Ralston Purina
Co. cereal plants. The city held its first free cereal breakfast in
1956 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Kellogg's founding.
   In 1977, Springfield unsuccessfully challenged Battle Creek; the
two cities began competing annually in 1986.

<HEAD>Massive Contra Demobilization Launched On Eve of Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL ALMENDRO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calling it ``a farewell to arms,''
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on Saturday watched thousands
of Contras line up to turn in their guns in a symbolic last push to
meet a deadline for demobilization.
   Nicaraguan officials said the Contras might meet Sunday's
deadline, but international organizations said it was unlikely.
   ``This emotional act puts an end to war in Nicaragua,'' Mrs.
Chamorro told rebels assembled in the grassy square of El Almendro.
``Farewell to arms and war. We are now going to live in
brotherhood.'' She spoke following a Mass offered by Roman Catholic
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   But Santiago Murray, a representative of the Organization of
American States' mission that provides aid to demobilized rebels,
said the process will continue several days beyond the deadline.
   About 2,000 rebels were present at the weekend demobilization at
El Almendro.
   Rebels with the U.S.-backed Contras began disarming May 7, but
the process was suspended twice. Some 7,500 members of the
12,000-member guerrilla force remained to be demobilized Saturday.
   Murray said international organizations do not have the capacity
to process more than 500 rebels a day, and bad weather was slowing
down the disarmament at Almendro.
   At least six rebel commanders handed over their combat rifles to
Mrs. Chamorro before a heavy thunderstorm sent people scattering for
cover.
   Among the Contra leaders disarming were Jose Benito Bravo, the
Contra chief of military intelligence.
   He stood in line with two thousand other rebels waiting to be
processed by UN and OAS officials as a first step before returning
to civilian life.
   Top Contra chief Israel Galeano, also known as Commander
Franklin, told his assembled fighters that disarming is one of the
``concrete steps that are being taken toward democracy.'' He said
demobilized rebels would now ``join in the efforts toward
reconstruction.''
   Despite the rain, UN peacekeeping troops proceeded to destroy the
guerrilla's rifles using acetylene torches to cut through the metal.
   The demobilization process also requires rebels to turn in their
combat fatigues, have their pictures taken and receive a medical
examination.

   Actor Dudley Moore on Saturday picked up
his two diplomas from Oxford University _ 32 years late.
   The 55-year-old actor attended the Magdalen College graduation
ceremonies and collected his Master of Arts and Bachelor of Music
degrees.
   Moore said he ``forgot'' to pick up the diplomas after finishing
classes in 1958.
   ``I just didn't seem to get round to it, but if I did have a
reason I don't think I'm going to explain why,'' said Moore, who
starred in films including ``Arthur'' and ``10.''
   The actor said the visit to Oxford, 52 miles northwest of London,
brought back memories of his university days when he studied the
organ.
   ``It just reminded me how comatose I was when I came here,'' he
said. ``I don't think I used my time here as I wanted to. I wasn't
working as hard as I might have done, but I think that is
everybody's complaint when they are here.''
   After the ceremony Moore, and his wife, Brogan, attended a garden
party at Magdalen College. The actor was also scheduled to give an
organ recital in the college chapel.

   An American miner kidnapped by South
American guerrillas will be released, and plans to continue working
in Ecuador, his employer said.
   Jeff Fino said he expects the guerrillas to honor their word to
return Scott Heimdal of Peoria after receiving $60,000 in ransom
Friday.
   ``These are people who are committed to their word,'' Fino said
in a telephone interview from Ecuador with the Peoria Journal Star
published Saturday. ``To these people, kidnapping is a business,
not a crime.''
   Fino also expects Heimdal to be back at his job.
   ``Scott's been telling his kidnappers that when he's released
he's going back to work in the mine,'' said Fino, a 39-year-old
Pennsylvania native who moved to Ecuador three years ago to work a
gold mine.
   Heimdal was taken during an April 28 ambush in an Ecuadoran
jungle that left one man dead and another seriously wounded.
   His family raised Heimdal's ransom through a public appeal
capped by a flurry of donations in the last few days. His parents,
Roy and Marge Heimdal, wired the $60,000 to a bank in Quito,
Ecuador, just before a deadline of noon Friday.
   Fino said the group has promised never again to harass employees
of Iminco, Fino's mining company. He said they have also promised
that no other guerrilla groups will harass the company's
operations. The kidnappers, members of a Colombian group known as
the Popular Liberation Army, have made similar promises in the past
and kept them, he said.
   ``Negotiations are proceeding well,'' he said. ``We have
excellent cooperation from many different agencies, people and
organizations. We have everything we feel we need.''
   Although he declined to identify the U.S. agencies involved, a
spokeswoman at U.S. Rep. Robert H. Michel's office said FBI and
State Department officials were sent to the area. The Controlled
Risk Group of London, a kidnap consulting firm that grew out of
Lloyd's of London insurance company in the 1960s, has also been
retained by Fino.
   Fino pointed out that the harshly worded demand for ransom never
states specifically the guerrillas will kill Heimdal if the ransom
is not raised.
   However, Heimdal's mother said the kidnappers threatened to
``show us where his body is'' if the ransom is not raised.
   Scott Heimdal's parents were resting Saturday, according to a
family member who answered their home phone. They hope to fly to
Ecuador to meet their son if and when he is released.
   Fino said that since the kidnapping the mine's operations have
shut down except for maintenance work.

   Opposition officials
will travel to the United States early next week for meetings with
members of Congress on alleged fraud in May 16 elections, a party
official said Saturday.
   There is still no clear winner in the race.
   Preliminary election results showed President Joaquin Balaguer
of the Social Christian Reformist party with 669,863 votes and the
Dominican Liberation Party's Juan Bosch with 647,969 votes.
   Bosch claimed there was widespread electoral fraud, and the
Central Electoral Council is undergoing a review of tally sheets at
each polling district to verify the results.
   Vicente Bengoa, an official with Bosch's party, said the
delegation will also travel to the Carter Center in Atlanta. Former
President Jimmy Carter was one of 30 international observers who
witnessed the election.
   It is unclear exactly when the delegation will arrive in the
United States or how long it will stay.
   Balaguer and Bosch, both in their 80s, have dominated Dominican
politics for the last three decades.

   A ghost town high above the city
disappeared Saturday when Fentier Village, an amusement park billed
as ``where the Old West comes east,'' was disassembled and
auctioned off.
   Carved into a mountaintop 1,500 feet up, the frontier town
replica was conceived by Ned Fenton, an insurance and real estate
agent who realized his dream of building an amusement park near
this far western New York state town. Fenton died of cancer six
months ago.
   Fentier Village, opened in 1966, was a three-tiered frontier
town connected by cable car and steps made of railroad ties.
Visitors also traveled through the park via stagecoach, a 1{-mile
train ride or on horseback.
   Along Main Street, with its requisite barber shop, bank and
hotel, good guys outdrew bad guys four times a day in staged
shootouts that ended with stuntmen _ often Fenton's sons _
``dying'' in dramatic falls from second-story porches.
   The park also featured Silver Dollar Ballroom, where such
entertainers as Hank Williams Jr. and Frank Sinatra Jr. appeared,
and a cinema that showed silent films.
   But three years later, the park closed when the state condemned
the parking lots and first tier at the base of the mountain to
build a superhighway.
   And the Code of the West didn't mean fire and building codes.
The buildings, maintained by Fenton in hopes of reopening the park
some day, failed to meet safety standards. They and their
furnishings were sold.
   Saturday's auction drew about 500 people and raised at least
$70,000.
   The high-price item was a truck carrying a calliope which went
for $8,600. An old nickelodian that prompted spirited bidding
brought $7,000.
   Other items included a huge chandelier, two coin-operated
``shoot-'em-up'' robotic cowboys, a life-sized fiberglass horse and
a number of horse-drawn wagons, carriages and sleighs.
   The park was on a mountain called Roundtop that, legend has it,
the Seneca Indians used as a burial ground.
   Fenton's sons envision developing the scenic property into a
year-round resort with skiing, horseback riding, restaurants and
possibly a hotel.
   Some came to the auction to get a last look at a part of their
past.
   ``The reason we came up here today is we came up here when we
were kids,'' said Carol Waldrip of nearby Olean. ``It's really kind
of sad for us to see all this stuff go.''

   Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich crowned a week
that started with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit by
winning his party's endorsement Saturday for an unprecedented
fourth term.
   Perpich, 61, won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's blessing on
the fourth ballot, defeating his former commerce commissioner, Mike
Hatch.
   Needing 60 percent of the vote, Perpich and Lt. Gov. Marlene
Johnson received about 64.4 percent to about 34.4 percent for Hatch
and his running mate, former state Sen. Emily Anne Staples.
   Gorbachev's historic stop in Minnesota was on Perpich's mind
when he accepted the endorsement.
   The Soviet president ``came to Minnesota to gain a heartland
experience, to see how Americans live,'' Perpich said. ``He saw a
state that works.''
   Hatch, who served as Perpich's commerce commissioner from 1983
through 1989, was rejected by delegates of a party he chaired from
1980 to 1982.
   The endorsement was a defeat for supporters of legalized
abortion, whose pro-choice position is the party's official stance.
Perpich opposes abortion and Hatch is an abortion rights advocate.
   Hatch, 42, called the delegates' decision a personal
disappointment but not a major setback for his campaign. He vowed
to continue on to the Sept. 11 primary.
   ``Voters want a new governor. ... If this party is not the agent
of change, it may be a victim of change,'' Hatch said.
   Perpich disagreed and said abortion will not be as big an issue
in the primary election as it was in the endorsement contest.
   ``There's a lot of hard work that has to be done. I think he's
thrown his Sunday punch and we're still standing,'' Perpich said of
his opponent.
   Four Republicans are seeking the nomination of their party,
which will choose a candidate next weekend.

<HEAD>City Loses More Than 1 Million Gallons After Water Main Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1 million gallons of
water gushed for hours from a broken main line in this coastal
community that already is in the throes of a drought.
   The line broke early Friday and water flooded for about three
hours before city workers shut off the flow. The spilled water was
8 feet deep near a downtown highway, said Charlie Hench, a
spokesman for the California Transportation Department.
   A highway improvement project is under way in the area and Hench
said a concrete support collapsed beneath the pipe, causing it to
break. Traffic was unaffected by the spill.
   City officials said the wasted water was enough to meet the
needs of 10 people for a year. They said earth eroded away by
rushing water would have to be replaced before the main could be
repaired.
   Effects of the water loss on the city's estimated 70,000
residents could not be determined. City Engineer Bruce Burnworth
and other city officials could not be reached Saturday by telephone.
   Southern California, including Santa Barbara, has been beset by
a water shortage this summer. The City Council declared a drought
emergency in February.
   Until new, long-term sources of water can be developed, city
officials have imposed stringent water rationing measures on
residents, including a ban on outdoor watering.

   A bomb exploded Saturday night outside a
250-year-old military building in central London, injuring 17
people, most of whom were at a birthday party inside, officials
said.
   Police superintendent David Smith said the blast at the barracks
of the Honorable Artillery Company in City Road, just north of the
City financial district, ``is being treated at top-level security
as a terrorist attack.''
   He said the bomb damaged the building known as Armory House,
built in 1735, which is part of the army reserve unit's barracks
complex.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion
fell on the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which has extended its
fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland to the British
mainland.
   David Dalton, assistant general manager of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, said the 12 women and five men were injured by flying
glass from shattered windows.
   He said none of the victims suffered serious injuries.
   Tom Parker, 21, a Canadian student at the London School of
Economics, said about 30 students were inside at a 21st birthday
party.
   ``We were all standing at the bar upstairs when there was a loud
bang. People were screaming and shouting and then they calmed down
and some of the older people started helping the injured,'' Parker
said.
   Chief Inspector Malcolm Hines of the city police force said the
explosion detonated on the roof of the building.
   ``There was no warning,'' he said.
   Residents half a mile from the scene said they heard the blast.
   The London Ambulance Service said five ambulances rushed to the
scene.
   Military and explosive experts were at the scene and surrounding
roads were blocked off, Parker said.
   In stepped up attacks outside Northern Ireland, IRA gunmen
killed one soldier and wounded two others in the northern England
city of Lichfield June 1 and have killed 14 people on the European
continent since 1978, most of them British military personnel.
   The Honorable Artillery Company is part of Britain's volunteer
Territorial Army, a 80,000-member reserve force for the
professional full-time army.
   The company, which specializes in reconnaissance and gunnery,
claims to be the oldest military body in Britain and was originally
a company of archers granted a charter by King Henry VIII in 1537.
   Their main object was the defense of London but the members also
fought in foreign wars and served with the fleet against the
Spanish Armada, which was defeated in its attempt to invade England
in 1588.

   Explosions and fire rocked a Norwegian
oil tanker in the Gulf of Mexico Saturday, killing at least two,
but authorities said it was unlikely the ship would foul Texas
beaches with a massive oil spill.
   Two crewmen were confirmed dead in the 1 a.m. explosion and,
authorities said two others were missing and presumed dead. Of the
crew of 41, 17 crew members were injured, none seriously, officials
said.
   The hunt for the missing crewmen was called off Saturday evening
after boats and airplanes were unable to find any trace of them.
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Rich Muller said the missing men
were probably still aboard the ship.
   The 853-foot supertanker Mega Borg was hauling about 38 million
gallons of light crude oil when the first blast occurred, 57 miles
southeast of Galveston, the Coast Guard said.
   The flames shot hundreds of feet high from the ship's air vents
as thick, black smoke _ which could be seen from 40 miles away _
curled from the ship's aft section.
   The fire continued to rage out of control late Saturday night,
as two fireboats sprayed jets of water on the flames. A Coast Guard
cutter stood by, and a third fireboat was en route.
   The battle was expected to last all night, more reinforcements
hired by the vessel's owner were expected to arrive Sunday morning,
Muller said.
   ``There'll be at least 10 vessels that will be going out to work
on the salvage operation,'' he said.
   He said the cost of the firefighting effort was being covered by
the owner.
   The Mega Borg could break up and sink, Muller said, but that was
considered a remote possibility. He said officials were unsure how
much damage the fire was doing to the ship.
   ``We've not seen any indication that the vessel will sink or
break apart,'' he added.
   The first explosion occurred in the engine room while the
15-year-old tanker was transferring its shipment to the Italian
tanker Framura.
   The Mega Borg had transferred 70,000 barrels of its 980,000
barrels of crude oil when the blast occurred, Coast Guard Capt. Tom
Greene said at a news conference in Galveston.
   ``We don't know what caused the spark or the fire or whatever,
but there were explosions and while our helicopters were on the
scene they witnessed another explosion _ so it's a pretty hot
fire,'' Petty Officer George Wilson said earlier in Houston.
   Two more explosions occurred shortly before 2 p.m. Saturday,
said Muller.
   Greene said about 7,000 gallons of crude oil or ship fuel spread
on the water, creating an oil sheen about 11 miles long and a
quarter-mile wide.
   Coast Guard officials speculated that the fuel poured into the
water from hoses used to transfer the oil to the Italian tanker, or
that it poured out the top of the tanker as the fire heated up the
oil and caused it to expand.
   ``If all goes well, I really don't expect much more pollution
than is out there,'' Greene said.
   ``We don't expect any of the oil to reach the Texas coast,''
said Ensign Larry Meredith of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety
Office in Galveston. ``It will mix with natural ocean water and _
if nature takes its course _ evaporate. Being 50, 60 miles off the
coast, we just expect it to evaporate.''
   In addition, the current was running parallel to the coast,
instead of towards it.
   Greene said the biggest fear was that the fire, which apparently
was being fed by burning engine oil or lubricating oil, might
spread to three cargo tanks near the engine room. The three tanks
hold 360,000 barrels, or roughly 15 million gallons of the light
crude.
   Greene said even if oil spilled, there would be no disaster like
the 11 million-gallon Exxon Valdez spill in 1989. More than 1,100
miles of Alaskan shoreline were soiled by the spill of heavy crude.
   The Mega Borg's shipment is light crude, which would disperse
much more rapidly than heavy crude, he said, adding that the Mega
Borg is much smaller than the Exxon Valdez.
   Following the blast, the Mega Borg's captain and first mate
escaped and were taken aboard the Coast Guard cutter Cushing. The
other surviving crew members, the captain's wife and his two
children were taken to Freeport aboard the commercial vessel
Patricia M.
   The 17 injured crew members were taken to Brazosport Memorial
Hospital in Lake Jackson, where two were hospitalized. The other 15
were treated for smoke inhalation and released, said nursing
supervisor Linda Runnels.
   The hospitalized crew members were in stable condition; one
underwent surgery for an injured tendon in his left arm and the
other suffered a leg injury, Ms. Runnels said.
   Coast Guard officials said they didn't know refinery or
refineries the oil was destined for. The Houston-Galveston area is
home to several major refineries.
   Greene said the fire could burn out of control for two days, and
authorities prepared for a worst-case scenario, putting together
response teams consisting of Environmental Protection Agency
officials, the Coast Guard Atlantic Strike Team and other state and
federal agencies.
   As a precaution, a high-seas boom to contain oil was being
brought in from Mobile, Ala., Greene said.
   Officials also requested a plane with a special infrared
detectors so authorities could track an oil spill at night.
   The Mega Borg was coming from Palanca, Angola. Its next port of
call, after Galveston, was scheduled to be Aruba.
   The tanker's U.S. agent is Biehl and Co. of Galveston. A man
answering the telephone there Saturday said the company had no
comment.
   The tanker is operated by Mosvolds Shipping of Farsund, Norway.
Managing Director Geir Larsen said his company owns a little less
than 50 percent of the tanker, through the K-S Mega Borg investment
group. He said other owners are private investors, whom he refused
to identify.
   Larsen said he knew of no previous problems with the ship. The
crew was from the Philippines and the officers are Indian; the
captain is C.M. Mahidhara, Larsen said.

   Canada's leaders signed a tentative deal Saturday
night to rescue a flagging constitutional accord that would grant
special status to French-speaking Quebec.
   Newfoundland's premier, Clyde Wells, said he remained
dissatisfied with the compromise but may submit it for a popular
referendum in his province.
   However, Wells signed the agreement with the nine other
provincial premiers in a nationally televised public session
Saturday night.
   ``This is a happy day for Canada,'' declared Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney before signing the document.
   The agreement was worked out in Ottawa at the end of the seventh
day of private talks aimed at persuading holdout provinces to
approve the package.
   Even if ratified, the constitutional amendment recognizing
Quebec as a ``distinct society'' clause would have no immediate
practical effect. However, it would oblige the Supreme Court to
consider the province's distinctiveness when considering specific
laws challenged under the constitution.
   It is also a symbol of enormous significance to French-speaking
Quebecers.
   ``It was a great exercise in nation building,'' said Ontario
Premier David Peterson after the accord was achieved. ``There was
blood in the floor, but it was common blood.
   But Wells declared, ``I am not approving of this particular
accord.''
   He said he may submit it to a popular or legislative referendum
in his province before the June 23 ratification deadline.
   New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna, who had been another
holdout until the latest talks, called the compromise ``the best
deal possible.''
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa initially boycotted the talks
Saturday after refusing to discuss any more changes in the clause
that would recognize Quebec as a ``distinct society.'' However,
later in the day, he returned to the talks.
   The tentative agreement would leave the distinct-society clause
unaltered but ask constitutional experts to prepare a legal opinion
on how it would affect the country's rights charter.
   Bourassa said of the final compromise: ``This is not affecting
the integrity of the Meech Lake accord. We are quite satisfied that
our objectives are fulfilled.''
   In announcing the agreement, Peterson said it must still be
approved by the legislatures of Newfoundland and New Brunswick as
well as a third holdout, Manitoba.
   Mulroney convened the 10 provincial leaders for the private
talks because they face a June 23 deadline for ratification of the
amendment to the 1982 Canadian constitution.
   Quebec refused to sign the constitution, saying it did not take
the province's distinct French character into consideration. In an
effort to win Quebec's support, the amendment, known as the Meech
Lake accord, contains the clause that designates Quebec a
``distinct society.''
   The other points in Meech Lake include expanding the provinces'
powers to opt out of some federal-provincial spending programs and
a new constitutional amending formula.
   Bourassa of Quebec has made no direct threats regarding
separatism if the accord is not approved, but nationalism is on the
rise in the province and there is a growing sentiment for either
separation or some sort of independence-association arrangement
with the rest of Canada.
   Canada has 25 million residents, but one-fourth of them live in
Quebec.
   In 1987, Mulroney and the 10 premiers signed a five-point
agreement for the Meech Lake constitutional amendment and set a
three-year deadline for ratification.
   In the interim, governments changed in Newfoundland, Manitoba
and New Brunswick and the new premiers reneged on the signatures of
their predecessors. Quebec had insisted the accord must be passed
as is and that other concerns worrying some of the premiers, such
as Senate reform, can be discussed at a future constitutional
conference.

<TEXT>
   Plans to raise a tugboat that sank in
the St. Johns River were postponed Saturday night, but only after
workers made sure no more diesel fuel was leaking from the 800-ton
vessel, officials said.
   The Captain Bill, which spilled about 1,000 gallons of diesel
fuel when it sank Friday in Jacksonville, was rescheduled for
raising Sunday with two cranes mounted on barges, U.S. Coast Guard
Lt. Lynn Woods said.
   Coast Guard officials and representatives of Crowley Towing and
Transportation Co., which contracted the 117-foot tug, said there
was no reason to rush because the disabled tug is mired outside a
main shipping channel and is no longer leaking fuel.
   ``The decision was to proceed with caution, do it right and
safely, since it was not impeding navigation and since the diesel
fuel was not leaking any longer,'' said Lucille Lane, director of
public relations for Crowley. ``The fuel is contained. Everything
at this point is secure.''
   Even so, small quantities of engine oil from the vessel were
still bubbling to the river's surface Saturday, Woods said.
   The Coast Guard has classified the spill as minor, but that
could change if a significant amount of the 53,000 gallons of
diesel fuel remaining on board begins to leak, Woods said.
   A fuel tank rupture during efforts to raise the vessel was not
considered a major threat, he said. The spilled fuel was cleaned up
using absorbent pads and a floating skimmer. Containment booms were
placed around the boat.
   Plans call for pumping the remaining fuel from the tug after it
is raised, then towing the vessel to the nearby Crowley dock or a
dry dock so it can be examined to determine what caused it to sink,
Woods said.
   The Captain Bill had been en route to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
taking a 400-foot barge loaded with sand to be used in
construction, when a device used to secure the barge to the tug
broke, Woods said. The tug was heading back to the Crowley docks
when it sank.

   The first black Episcopal bishop in the Los
Angeles diocese was elected Saturday by clergy and lay delegates.
   A two-thirds majority of 180 clergy and 400 lay delegates
elected the Rev. Chester L. Talton, 48, as assistant bishop on the
fifth ballot. There were six other candidates.
   ``I'm a little stunned, yet I am very pleased,'' said Talton,
rector of St. Philip's Episcopal Church in New York City's Harlem
neighborhood.
   ``I feel a real nudging toward the Diocese of Los Angeles from
the Holy Spirit,'' Talton said. ``I look forward to working with
laity and clergy to address the many issues the church faces
today.''
   Talton's duties will be to assist diocesan Bishop Frederick H.
Borsch in overseeing the six-county diocese, which has 80,000
members in 150 congregations.
   ``I respect him for his wisdom, spirituality and love for
others,'' Borsch said of Talton.
   Talton has led the 500-member St. Philip's Church, one of the
largest congregations of black Episcopalians, since 1985.
   A native of Eldorado, Ariz., he grew up in Oakland. Talton
received a master of divinity degree from the Episcopal Church
Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley.
   He will succeed the Right Rev. Oliver B. Garver Jr., who retires
June 30 to serve as chaplain of the Harvard School in Studio City.
   The diocese contains Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, Ventura
and San Bernadino counties and part of Riverside County.

   Heavy rains forced up to 10,000 people
from their homes, and National Guard troops hoisted sandbags on an
earthen wall at Buckeye Lake to keep the water from spilling over.
   Authorities said the evacuees in Licking County were forced to
leave their homes temporarily because of the flood threat. The
National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning, citing
possible dam failure at the man-made lake.
   Flooding also was reported farther south in Perry County. County
Disaster Services Coordinator Dorothy Sidwell said residents were
evacuated from sections of New Lexington and Crooksville, but the
number of people affected was not known.
   In Pennsylvania, a fast-moving storm system drenched some of the
state's central and eastern counties Saturday, leaving behind
pockets of darkness from power outages and barns burned and
chimneys damaged by bolts of lightning.
   The thunderstorms crossed the state about 50 mph, said weather
service meteorologists in Pittsburgh.
   About 10,000 households in Pittsburgh were without power for
little over an hour Friday night because of high winds, officials
said. In Bethlehem, electrical storms knocked out power to more
than 45,000 people on Friday and Saturday.
   In Licking County, the evacuations began shortly before dawn but
people were allowed to return by afternoon. The weather service
said 2 to 4 inches of rain fell overnight in central and north
central Ohio.
   About 50 Ohio National Guard soldiers helped volunteers
reinforce the wall with sandbags and assisted with evacuations of
about 2,000 residents of the town of Buckeye Lake, about 30 miles
east of Columbus.
   Gov. Richard Celeste visited Buckeye Lake after declaring a
state of emergency in the county. He said he would ask President
Bush to declare Licking County a federal disaster area.
   Licking County Sheriff Gerry Billy said officials took steps to
reduce pressure on the weakened earthen wall by opening floodgates
on the spillway at Buckeye Lake. Water levels had reached the top
when rains ended at midmorning.
   Flooding also forced the evacuation of about 3,000 people in
south Newark living near the Licking River and campers at a
racetrack, authorities said.
   As many as 5,000 other Licking County residents may have been
displaced temporarily, said Randy Spiker, deputy director of the
county disaster services agency.
   Buckeye Lake covers more than 3,000 acres in portions of three
central Ohio counties. The man-made lake was created in the 19th
century to hold water for the Erie Canal.
   The lake reaches depths of eight to 10 feet, especially along
the 4-mile-long retaining wall, which is about 12 feet tall, Ohio
Department of Natural Resources officials said. Only sandbags,
stacked two-deep, kept water from lapping over the top of the
earthen wall and into homes whose porches opened onto it.
   Spiker said water from the lake was being released into the
Licking River.
   ``We've got monitors watching it downstream, and it does not
seem to be causing any trouble at this time,'' he said.
   Twelve miles of Interstate 70 were closed for a short while,
said Beverly Schell, a highway patrol dispatcher. Some exits were
blocked to all but emergency traffic.
   The deck of a bridge on U.S. 40 east of Jacksontown was washed
away, Spiker said.
   In addition to Licking County, Celeste declared a state of
emergency in Perry County, where flooding prompted evacuations in
New Lexington and Crooksville.
   Elsewhere around Ohio, tornadoes and thunderstorms triggered
localized flooding. There were no reports of major damage, but a
Wayne County man was missing after falling from a dam.
   Authorities said Guy Over of West Salem was missing and feared
drowned after falling into the rain-swollen Apple Creek stream in
Wooster.
   Another man was reported missing after apparently falling into
the Licking River while floating on an inner tube Saturday night
near St. Louisville, said Steve Prince, a Licking County sheriff's
dispatcher. The man's identity was not immediately released.
   The storms Friday night and Saturday morning followed a round of
heavy rain that caused urban and small-stream flooding early in the
morning and knocked out power to thousands of electrical customers.

Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state attorney general is investigating
allegations that a founder of a newspaper sold by the homeless took
money after resigning, a spokesman said Saturday.
   New York Newsday and the Daily News, quoting unidentified
sources, reported Saturday that employees of Street News have told
the attorney general's office as much as $250,000 is unaccounted
for.
   Edward Barbini, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams,
said the office had received reports that co-founder Hutchinson
Persons, who resigned Wednesday, may have taken money from the
paper.
   ``We're investigating those charges,'' Barbini said.
   ``The attorney general believes there were people getting helped
by this,'' the spokesman said. ``It would be a shame if Hutchinson
Persons was pre-eminent among them.''
   Street News spokesman Jeffrey Sussman said Persons had submitted
his resignation, but said he had no evidence of misappropriation of
funds.
   Sussman told the News that the allegations were ``rumors
fabricated by ex-employees. ... You'd have to be pretty stupid to
take money with the whole world watching you.''
   A message left on Persons' answering machine was not immediately
returned, but he and others have said repeatedly that those who
started the paper six months ago worked for little or no money
until he accepted a salary of less than $50,000 early this year.
   Wendy Koltun, the paper's co-founder who left Street News in
January in a disagreement over Persons' management style, said she
was confident the allegations were false.
   ``He wrote me a note saying, `All I want is the shirt on my
back,''' she said.
   ``He left for the good of the paper so it could continue,'' she
said. ``The media made him very controversial and he realized this.
He realized that if the paper was going to survive and do what we
had originally intended to do, he would have to leave.''
   Street News began publishing in November, and has been sold on
streets and subways by homeless people who keep 50 cents of the 75
cents for each sale.
   Persons said in an interview several weeks ago that he had
considered quitting the paper ``about 20 or 30 times'' because of
all the stress it caused.
   Fellow staff members of the paper accused him of ``erratic and
irresponsible behavior,'' including sudden firings.

<TEXT>
   An ex-Nazi seeking the Republican nomination
for lieutenant governor spoke to about 100 people Saturday outside
the home of a Ku Klux Klan leader.
   Ralph Forbes, in a runoff battle against black businessman
Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris, is known as a white supremacist and Klan
sympathizer.
   In a May 29 primary, Forbes won 46 percent of the vote to 36
percent for Harris, but failed to win the 50 percent necessary to
prevent a runoff, which is set for Tuesday.
   Republican leaders have endrosed Harris.
   ``I say the white race is supremely stupid because we've allowed
our country to get stolen from us,'' Forbes told reporters before
addressing a crowd of about 100 people who gathered outside the
home of Thom Robb, a grand wizard of the Klan.
   Robb was hosting his semiannual Patriots' Day picnic. He said
about 25 percent of the crowd at his home in rural Boone County
were Klan members.
   Forbes told a story of an eagle that flew into a barnyard of
chickens and turkeys and didn't know his real heritage. The
chickens and turkeys looked down on the eagle, then ``black crows''
came down and stole the eagle's food, Forbes said.
   A storm erupted and the eagle opened its wings and was able to
brave the storm, he said. Forbes said he identifies with the eagle.
   ``Now is the time to face the storm,'' Forbes said. ``When we
realize we are not chickens, we are not turkeys, we are American
eagles, we are going to rise above the storm and we are going to
beat this thing.''
   Robb said he personally backed Forbes for the GOP nomination.
   ``The Klan doesn't endorse anybody, but I personally am for
him,'' Robb said.

   A 10-year-old boy charged with
aggravated battery for allegedly flattening the nose of a
schoolmate who called him ``fatso'' walked out of court a free
child after a judge dismissed the case.
   Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Korda dropped the charge Friday
against Bobby Woods after a prosecutor told him the only witness to
the schoolyard scuffle last August now says the other boy started
the fight.
   Bobby's lawyer, Paul Stark, was elated but still angry that
prosecutors ever bothered to pursue the case.
   ``This matter should have been resolved in a principal's office,
not in a court of law,'' Stark said.
   Bobby said Khalid Fathallah, also 9 at the time, and another boy
called him ``fatso,'' said ``oink oink'' and tried to kick him on
the playground of Plantation Park Elementary School. Bobby, 5 feet
tall and 101 pounds, responded by punching Khalid in the nose.
   Khalid's parents, Hassib and Vicki Fathallah of Plantation, said
their son's nose was broken. They pressed charges after Bobby's
father, Nolan Woods, refused to pay more than half the medical
bills.
   Assistant State Attorney Susan Aramony said the other boy gave a
sworn statement to Stark backing Bobby's claim that Khalid started
the fight.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to
concerns that short-range nuclear missiles could leak plutonium, is
ordering Air Force bombers to stop carrying older missiles until
safety studies are completed.
   Cheney said in a statement Friday he was taking the step as ``a
precaution.''
   The directors of three U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories called
for the withdrawal of the weapons during congressional testimony
last month. They suggested there was a remote possibility the
weapons could leak plutonium in an accident.
   The missiles are known as the Short-Range Attack Missile-A, or
SRAM-As, and are carried aboard the nation's 372 deployed B-52, B-1B
and FB-111 bombers. The Air Force has said that 1,500 of the weapons
were produced between 1971 and 1975, but the current number deployed
is classified.

   President Bush is pledging that a united

strongly opposes _ and Bush said they talked about ``an expanded
role'' for the Western alliance in the future.
   ``We also agree that the Soviets have understandable interests in
all of this but we did not try to fashion some compromise at this
juncture,'' he said in the Rose Garden where he and Kohl took
questions from reporters.
   Bush said further consultations will take place before and after
the July meeting of allied leaders in London.

   A former Army sergeant accused of selling
NATO's nuclear defense secrets to East bloc governments speaks four
languages, has an amazing memory and has shown no remorse since he
confessed, an FBI agent testified.
   U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth Jenkins on Friday ordered Roderick
James Ramsay, 28, held until a bond hearing Tuesday on a charge of
conspiracy to gather or deliver defense information to aid a foreign
government.
   Ramsay's arrest Thursday night came only a day after his former
Army supervisor and classified documents manager, Clyde Lee Conrad,
43, was convicted of treason in a West German court and sentenced to
life in prison.
   FBI agents say Conrad masterminded an espionage ring that sold
highly sensitive information to Hungarian and Czechoslovakian
intelligence agents, who eventually passed it to the Soviet KGB.

   A federal judge rejected Manuel Noriega's claim that
the United States has no jurisdiction to indict him on charges he
trafficked drugs as Panama's leader.
   In a second blow Friday to Noriega's legal defense, a
co-defendant in a parallel Tampa indictment named the ousted
Panamanian dictator as a ``silent partner'' in a drug ring.
   In Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler rejected defense
claims that Noriega had immunity for his actions and could not be
prosecuted for activities outside the United States.
   In Tampa, Panamanian jeweler Enrique A. ``Kiki'' Pretelt admitted
in a plea agreement that he helped launder drug proceeds with two
convicted Tampa drug smugglers, according to a 10-page plea

   Sheriff's deputies made their first
arrest of a record retailer under a federal judge's ruling deeming a
rap record by 2 Live Crew obscene. The band's leader said his record
label will help pay legal fees.
   The group performed its sexually explicit material live in Miami
Beach early today. Authorities did not interfere with the 45-minute
show.
   The audience cheered when band leader Luther Campbell shouted
vulgarities about Gov. Bob Martinez and Broward County Sheriff Nick
Navarro, whose deputies Friday arrested E-C Records owner Charles
Freeman, 31, on misdemeanor charges of distributing obscene material.
   The deputies burst into the store after an undercover agent
bought the group's recording ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday is obscene. The
ruling did not affect live performances.

<HEAD>When Will the Small-Stock Effect Show Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-standing records suggest clearly that sound
investments in quality small stocks can produce much better returns
than portfolios consisting only of large-company stocks.
   The very idea tends to challenge conventional thinking, because
you seldom hear about the little fellas but you can't escape hearing
about the big boys who make up the popular stock market averages.
   The big brokerage houses research and promote big stocks. Mutual
funds and pension funds buy them. Business magazines interview
big-company managers. Big- company products are advertised wherever
people can see or hear.
   But the records show one area in which the little guys beat the
big guys: The little guys, as a category, often can produce bigger
returns for investors than the big fellows. And they've been doing
it for many years.
   Several research projects demonstrate this, but probably the
first of them was by Rolf Banz, a doctoral student at the University
of Chicago in 1978, who examined all New York Stock Exchange stocks
by size for every year in the period 1931-74.
   He determined size by multiplying shares of each stock by share
price. He ``invested'' equal dollars in each company in the bottom
20 percent, ranked by market value. Each year he revised the list to
include only the smallest.
   Banz found that in that period his hypothetical portfolio
produced about a 5 percent better annual rate of return than the
market as a whole. Others later found a similiar effect, although
not always by the same percentages.
   Five percent might not seem like much, especially at a time when
some folks aren't happy if they realize that kind of gain in a
month. But time is the forgotten factor of investing, and 5 percent
over the years adds up beautifully.
   Gerald Perritt, investment adviser, mathematician and author of a
book on the small-firm effect, calculates that in the 60 years
1926-85 the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index had a compound annual
return rate of 9.8 percent, versus a 12.6 percent compound annual
rate for the so-called small stocks.
   He finds, therefore, that if an investor had been able to invest
$1,000 in the S&amp;P index at the end of 1926, that initial investment
would have grown to $279,100 by the end of 1985.
   But the smaller-stock portfolio would have grown to $1,241,200.
   Now a mystery, albeit one with many clues: In the past five years
or so the small-stock effect seems to have disappeared. Perritt, a
former professor who liked the effect so much he founded a
newsletter to trace it, concedes it.
   He doesn't concede much more, however. He is convinced it still
exists. He re-examines it from time to time in the newsletter,
Investment Horizons, and recently he offered some reasons why small
hasn't outperformed big.
   First, he says, individual investors have been liquidating their
direct common stock holdings in recent years, while institutional
investors have been net accumulators. That helped push the bigs
higher, relative to small.
   Institutional investors generally concentrate their selections on
the large stocks _ they almost have to because of their appetite for
big blocks of shares _ while individuals traditionally have been
buyers of small-company stocks.
   Additionally, the stock market of the late 1980s was one of
takeovers and mergers, most of which were concentrated in large
companies. And as most investors know, those takeovers pushed up
prices spectacularly.
   Perritt, based in Chicago, is biding his time, still convinced
that smaller stocks are the best bargains in the marketplace today.
The long-term effect will again show up. He doesn't say when that
might be.
   ``Just because a store puts merchandise on sale is no guarantee
there will be a stampede of customers,'' he says. ``The same
behavior exists in the stock market.''
   But, he concludes, ``when word of such bargains eventually
spreads, demand begins to heighten as do the prices of the
merchandise.''

   Danny Elfman's hopes for a music career seemed
doomed from the start. Guitar, piano and violin teachers offered him
the same advice _ forget it.
   ``Danny, a musical career is not what we recommend for you. You
like art. Can you paint? Can you draw? Why don't you try to find
something else?''
   Today, the 37-year-old Elfman is among the most sought-after film
composers. The latest of his 15 scores is for Warren Beatty's ``Dick
Tracy.''
   Elfman almost giggles as he recalls those rejections from his
youth. ``I received nothing but discouragement. I just had no
apptitude as a musician.'' Those music teachers, wherever they are,
ought to be ashamed of themselves. Elfman was no prodigy, but the
frenetic front man for the rock band Oingo Boingo is showing up his
early critics.
   More than an adequate guitar player, Elfman is in his 11th year
of belting out songs of black humor about death and restless
spirits. Back in 1979, the band thought it would only survive for
six months.
   Oingo Boingo, a fixture on the Los Angeles club scene but a no-go
on mainstream radio, has a rabid following in, of all places,
Brazil, among surfers and skateboarders.
   ``You turn on Brazilian radio, you listen to any station for 45
minutes and you hear a Boingo song,'' Elfman says. ``At first I was
turned off because by our standards, we're not surf music. That's
the Beach Boys. I just had to adjust my way of thinking. If
Brazilian surfers want to listen to Oingo Boingo, who's to tell them
not to?''
   Avant-garde movie director Tim Burton saw Oingo Boingo at a club
in Los Angeles and recruited Elfman to score ``Pee-wee's Big
Adventure.'' More Burton works _ ``Beetlejuice,'' and last summer's
blockbuster ``Batman'' _ followed. Later this year, Burton and
Elfman's teamwork on ``Edward Scissorhands'' will be in theaters.
   ``It's pretty much nonstop,'' Elfman said in a recent interview
following a sold-out Oingo Boingo concert at the Royal Oak Music
Theater.
   ``I am in a unique position that I never could have quite
imagined myself in. It kind of came out of the blue with `Pee-wee's
Big Adventure.'''
   Elfman was typecast as a composer for film comedies. He took a
few more, then began to decline because he had the band to consider.
Oingo Boingo recently completed its first tour east of the Rockies
to promote its new album, ``Dark at the End of the Tunnel,'' on MCA.
   Oingo Boingo _ the name really doesn't mean anything, Elfman says
_ still has its lead man. But time is tight when you juggle careers
as disparate as rock music and film composing.
   ``I don't think the same when I'm doing one or the other. ... I'm
very disciplined as a film composer,'' Elfman says. ``It means I
work ... 12 hours a day, seven days a week when I'm scoring. You
have so-and-so many minutes of music to write. You have 30 days. You
have 60 minutes of music. That's two minutes a day _ that's the
bottom line, an absolute.''
   Writing songs for the band is the opposite. ``I can never make
myself write a song. In fact, that's a sure way not to write a song.
Songs come when they damn well please.''
   Elfman usually limits himself to two movie scores a year, and
some for television, including the hit animated series ``The
Simpsons.''
   Beatty lured Elfman back from a vacation in the Bahamas to talk
about doing ``Dick Tracy.'' Elfman stalled Beatty for a weekend of
Caribbean sun but couldn't refuse the job.
   A recording of his score is one of three albums being released
from the movie. Rock singer Madonna, who co-stars with Beatty, has
an album on which she sings many of the Stephen Sondheim lyrics from
the film. A record of source music also is scheduled.
   Oingo Boingo's recent tour was a nice change of pace for Elfman,
but it's composing that most excites _ and frustrates _ him.
   Take ``Batman.'' Elfman created the brooding musical backdrop,
yet pop star Prince received most of the attention. It was much
later that music fans and the music press realized ``Batman'' had
Elfman's score and Prince's soundtrack.
   ``It was annoying for me before the movie came out that people
didn't know the difference.'' Elfman artistically would prefer the
score to be the only music to a movie, but he understands marketing
realities.
   Oingo Boingo has contributed plenty of songs to film, including
``Flesh and Blood'' from its current album to ``Ghostbusters II,''
the title song to ``Summer School'' and the theme song to ``Weird
Science.''

<HEAD>Stock Rally Faces a Profit Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When they list all the reasons why the stock
market has shown so much enthusiasm over the latest slowdown in the
economy, most Wall Street analysts make no mention of the outlook
for corporate profits.
   In fact, many of them acknowledge, uncertainty about earnings
prospects looms as a big potential stumbling block in the way of
continued gains in stock prices from their recent record highs.
   In the market's much-heralded advance since late April, financial
observers have cheered the drop in interest rates that greeted
slower-than-expected growth in employment and production.
   It is also great news, they say, that the threat of a resurgence
of inflation has faded as business activity turned sluggish again.
   But followers of the market are left to wonder how long stocks
can keep climbing without encouragement from hopes for a sustained
expansion of earnings to justify higher share prices.
   ``There seems to be too much `heads we win, tails we win'
thinking,'' says Rao Chalasani, analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben,
the Cleveland-based investment firm. ``There is no solid evidence
that the profit margin squeeze is coming to an end.''
   Or as Byron Wien writes in a current market commentary for Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., ``The current investment attitude does not look
properly balanced. Only the sweet side of the slowdown is being
factored into stock prices.''
   Optimists maintain that stock traders, as a group, can sense
favorable forces for the long-term profit outlook long before there
is any tangible evidence that earnings are actually improving.
   ``Some may argue that economic data imply greater potential for
recession and thus increase the risks for the stock market,'' says
Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``But we argue that
these risks are acceptable _ even welcome if they result in lower
inflation and interest rates.
   ``Although our profit forecasts are being lowered, we believe
that stocks sell on earning power relative to interest rates, as
well as on current earnings. Thus, we expect the equity market to
rise in the months ahead, even given lower earnings expectations.''
   Edward Kirschner at PaineWebber Inc. contends that stock traders
have actually been very discerning and discriminating in sorting out
profit prospects of late _ in particular by bidding for companies
with an international bent.
   Among individual stocks, he says, ``there are a very few strong
market leaders, trailed by many laggards. Among these winners, there
is a common theme behind their outperformance: Earnings, earnings,
earnings.
   ``The U.S. economy is still a tough environment in which to make
a buck. Certainly, recent reports concerning housing starts, retail
sales, industrial production and durable goods orders provide little
evidence of a robust domestic economy.
   ``By comparison,'' Kirschner adds, ``foreign economies are
wonderful _ they are growing much faster than the U.S.
   ``We believe that the best place to find earnings is overseas,
where growth is stronger and U.S. firms, backed by a tougher U.S.
trade policy and changing foreign tastes, are gaining market share.''
   On a less sanguine note, Wein cautions, ``I don't think we will
see the combination of higher earnings and lower interest rates that
would support much higher prices.''

   At the Village Vanguard, legend has it, you can
tell how a band is doing just by listening to the room.
   As interpreted by one veteran observer, here's what the room had
to say about the Harper Brothers:
   ``It said `They belong here,''' insisted owner Lorraine Gordon,
whose jazz club was the setting for the Harper Brothers' acclaimed
live ``Remembrance'' album. ``The room did not reject it. It said,
`They're wonderful here. They're going to come back.'''
   Of course, the Harper Brothers, a quintet featuring drummer
Winard Harper and trumpeter Philip Harper, have a few things to say
about the Vanguard, a room lined with pictures of Coleman Hawkins,
Miles Davis and many others. This is the jazz version of Yankee
Stadium, the kind of place you walk into and immediately think of
those who played there before.
   ``The good thing about it, when we performed there and recorded
it, was that it was the first time that everybody in the band had
recorded there,'' Winard recalled in a recent interview.
   ``I remember going by in the afternoons, setting up the drums. I
went by there with Lorraine. She walked me around the club, telling
me, `This is where such and so did this.' This is our (Charlie)
Mingus light. We never changed it because Mingus got mad and hit
this light.''
   There is no landmark yet for the Harper Brothers, no light or
floor panel or section on the wall.
   They have plenty of time, though. Winard is just 27, Philip 24.
They're still at the stage of their careers where they're the ones
telling the stories, instead of having stories told about them.
   The late Dexter Gordon is a favorite subject. Winard, who says he
has hours worth of taped conversations with the great saxophonist,
recalled seeing him in the mid-1980s and got to play in his band.
   ``The way Dexter would act was mystifying to me. He would stand
on the edge and you didn't know if he was going to fall. I got
hooked. I would go every night,'' he said.
   ``One night, Dexter came into the club real late. He comes
strolling in. He's supposed to be in at 8 and he strolls in around
11. The band was there on time so they were really mad. When I
walked in, the regular drummer was tired and ready to go home and he
asked me if I wanted to play. We switched and Dexter never knew.''
   The group, which also includes alto sax player Justin Robinson,
pianist Stephen Scott and bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa, believes in
tradition. Philip, a hard-hitting trumpeter, is openly influenced by
Lee Morgan, while the flashy Winard _ ``just so elegant'' is how
Lorraine Gordon describes him _ follows the beat of Tony Williams.
   They grew up in Baltimore and Atlanta and got their first musical
experience playing in the rock 'n' roll band of older brother Danny.
In 1980, Winard left Atlanta _ he spent one semester at the
Cincinnati Conservatory _ and eventually settled in Washington,
forming the D.C. Jazz Quintet, which Philip joined.
   Now based in Jersey City, N.J., the Harpers released their
self-titled debut album in 1988 and took a chance by recording their
next album in a city notorious for its hard-to-please jazz fans.
   Winard described New York audiences as ``conservative'' and
Philip went on to describe the problems of unwinding in front of
rows of folded arms.
   ``We had our fans there, our family. There was no doubt some
great playing was on that release,'' Philip insisted. ``I think,
still, with everything going on, knowing we were at the Vanguard and
doing a recording, we probably weren't as loose as we normally can
be.
   ``Just working in New York itself can be different, kind of
scary. There's no place like New York. Whenever you play in New
York, you got to be at your best. You never know who's going to be
around.''
   ``Remembrance'' runs for over an hour and features Horace
Silver's ``Kiss Me Right,'' plus originals by Danny, Winard and
Philip Harper. Two songs, Winard's ``Hodge Podge'' and Danny's
``Remembrance,'' are tributes to their late father, Hodges Harper,
who introduced his kids to the music of Lester Young and other jazz
greats.
   ``He saw Winard beating on the shoe polish cans and figured maybe
he wants to learn the drums,'' Philip recalled. ``My first love was
the bass, so they got me a guitar and it wasn't quite the same.
   ``I wouldn't mess with the drums because we were always too
competitive. One day, I heard a Lee Morgan record and it just amazed
me that he could make it sound like that.''
   Winard spoke again of Dexter Gordon. He remembers the history
lessons, Gordon's stories of playing with Billy Eckstine and dating
Billie Holiday, and the special feelings of the jazz community. He
also talked of Gordon's style, how much a young drummer could learn
by just picking up on the rhythms of an experienced man's voice.
   ``Dexter, he was an individual, like Lester Young or (Theolonius)
Monk. Those guys had so much personality, something that was
strictly theirs. Dexter just had a whole other langauge, altogether.
You'd hardly hear what he was saying because you'd be in awe of how
he was delivering it.
   ``This music helps to bring out the individual. It's like the
difference between something handmade and something factory made.
For us, our main goal is to develop as much as possible and become
as personal as possible. As we grow and progess, the more individual
we become.''

<HEAD>Romania's Hungarian Minority Fearful but Defiant After Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AGHIRES, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jozsef Palka shoved his sweat-stained
black fedora to the back of his head, grimaced and spat into the
dust of the road that runs through the village.
   ``It's not going to make them stop poking fun at us when we go
into the store and speak our own language,'' Palka, 51, said of
Romania's first free elections in 53 years, in which the the ethnic
Hungarian party did very well.
   Hoots of agreement came from other residents of Aghires, a
Hungarian hamlet in Transylvania, 200 miles northwest of Bucharest.
   Politics and nearly everything else are ethnic in Transylvania,
which Romanians and Hungarians have contested for centuries.
   Palka's wife Ilona, 46, muttered ``The dog is dead, but the chain
is still there'' when asked whether the Hungarians would fare better
in a democracy than they had under Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   For the people of Aghires, life has been a ``them and us''
struggle with the ethnic Romanian majority for generations.
Romanians who remember the most recent period of Hungarian rule _
during World War II _ recite a litany of abuses.
   Hungary sided with Germany in the war, partly because of a
promise that it would regain territory lost after World War I.
   Crimes have been committed by both sides over the centuries as
Transylvania, a region rich in fertile land and minerals, repeatedly
changed hands. It now makes up more than one-third of Romania.
   The indifference of past rulers to legitimate aspirations of the
other nationality generated a deep enmity between the communities,
but they joined in the December uprising because Ceausescu's hand
had fallen heavily on both.
   When the dictator was overthrown and executed, many of Romania's
2.2 million ethnic Hungarians expected instant recognition of such
demands. Those included university instruction in their own language
and some local political power.
   Many Romanians, on the other hand, saw the ethnic Hungarian
assertiveness as an attempt to wrest Transylvania away from Romania
once again.
   Street fighing broke out in March at Tirgu Mures, an evenly
divided town of 300,000 people about 175 miles northwest of
Bucharest. Six people were killed and more than 300 injured.
   Hungarian anxieties are most palpable in and around Tirgu Mures.
   ``I go to a Romanian school, but in a Hungarian class,''
17-year-old Hajnalka Barabas told a Western visitor to Chendu, 15
miles west of the town. ``We really have to be careful.
   ``I was stopped recently on the way home by Romanian students,
and they said ... they would kill me,'' she said. ``Another time,
they threw stones.''
   An elderly parking attendant at a hotel in Tirgu Mures, beamed
when addressed in Hungarian.
   ``I always speak Hungarian first,'' he said. ``Then I try German
and French, and only then Romanian.''
   Even the better-than-expected election showing by the ethnic
Hungarian political party is a mixed blessing. The Hungarians fear
the result was strong enough to increase Romanian anxieties, but too
weak to achieve Hungarian goals.
   Although the Hungarian Democratic Federation in Romania finished
second nationally, it got only 7 percent of the vote, compared with
66 percent for President Ion Iliescu's winning National Salvation
Front.
   It ran first in the Tirgu Mures area, where the results also
reflected increased tensions caused by the violence in March.
   The ethnic Hungarian party won 40 percent amd a conservative
alliance called AUR, which both Hungarians and Romanians view as
anti-Hungarian, was second with 37 percent. The National Salvation
Front was a distant third with 16 percent.
   Istvan Kiraly, a senior member in Tirgu Mures of the Hungarian
Democratic Federation, voiced the frustrations of many ethnic
Hungarians.
   ``When the political parties look at us, they look at us as
Hungarians and not at what our political platform is,'' Kiraly, 43,
said in an interview. ``Nobody accepts us here, in a country where
the main aspect of politics was always based on nationalism.''
   He said every vote for the AUR alliance was a vote against
Hungarians.
   If the ethnic Hungarian party should win regional elections next
year, ``the Romanians could never accept this,'' he said. ``They
think everyone different from them is a potential enemy. We expect
big battles.''
   The AUR faction most feared by Hungarians is Vatra Romaneasca, a
populist movement they accuse of instigating the March violence.
Vatra Romaneasca claims Hungarian extremists started the trouble.
   Ioan Czizmas, a Vatra member, said of the ethnic Hungarians:
   ``They are like children who ask their parents, `Why can't we
have this? Why can't we have that?' They are looking for the first
possibility to form an enclave, then an autonomous Transylvania.''

   Wealthy and discriminating male shoppers have
known the Zegna name for decades. Members of European royal families
and affluent Asian businessmen have Zegna suits in their wardrobes.
   The Italian clothier hopes to capitalize on its cachet by opening
a store of its own in the United States.
   An elegant Zegna menswear shop will debut around Father's Day in
the shoppers' Mecca of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. It will join a half
dozen other Zegna stores located at the right ritzy addresses in
foreign fashion capitals.
   By venturing into U.S. retailing, Zegna wants to drum up more
interest in its label. The goal is to boost business for Zegna
merchandise sold around the country at upscale department stores,
such as Neiman Marcus, and tony boutiques, including Ultimo in
Chicago and San Francisco's Wilkes Bashford.
   Richard Cohen, president of Ermenegildo Zegna USA, the Italian
group's American arm, says the store is the centerpiece of a
marketing strategy to enhance Zegna's U.S. wholesale business.
Annual U.S. sales volume has been running at roughly $20 million and
Cohen expects it will grow substantially over the next few years.
   Zegna, pronounced to rhyme with Kenya, will be following the
examples of classy lines like Burberry's, Chanel, Hermes, Louis
Vuitton and others that increased American consumer awareness of
their goods by opening stores here.
   ``We like to think of ourselves in the same ilk as those
companies,'' Cohen says.
   The timing isn't perfect to launch into retailing. ``Obviously
it's not the best economic climate right now,'' concedes Cohen.
   Middle-of-the road retailers have fallen by the wayside as
specialty merchants have made inroads into their business.
Discounters and generalists _ including the now vulnerable-looking
goliath Sears, Roebuck and Co. _ have discarded long-held pricing
and merchandising practices in a bid to keep a grasp on market share.
   Still, Cohen is confident. High quality goods, he says, have what
it takes to attract customers even in tough times. ``You continue to
do well in bad economic times because you're offering value for
money.''
   Luxury retailers aren't immune to problems if increasing numbers
of consumers convert to more conservative buying habits. But luxury
really never goes out of style among people with loads of money who
view every purchase _ even a new suit _ as an investment, notes John
Mincarelli, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in
New York.
   No matter what the economy is doing, the time might be right for
what Zegna has to offer.
   ``What's happened is we're finding custom tailoring is becoming a
status symbol again,'' says Mincarelli. ``It always was but now it's
more pevalent.''
   Men's fashion guru Alan Flusser, an author, designer and store
owner, believes a revival has begun in made-to-measure suits.
   ``As prices of men's clothes have risen precipitously, the
difference between a good ready-made suit and a good custom-made
suit has narrowed,'' Flusser says. ``The custom-made suit has had a
rennaissance in this country.''
   Indicating that a trend has developed, more retailers and
manufacturers with retail outlets are upgrading their tailoring
services. Some bring their fabrics and samples to offices for
customers too busy for in-store shopping. The ranks of these
haberdashers who make house calls has expanded recently and include
such mainstream quality clothing makers as HartMarx.
   Zegna will offer roving tailors too. The fitters will visit
offices and elsewhere to accomodate customers needing to be measured
for alterations on ready-made clothing or for custom-made suits. The
store will schedule private appointments for after-hours customers.
   ``The name of the game in this day and age is service,'' Cohen
says. ``When your customer is available is when you make yourself
available.''
   At the top of the scale, a made-to-measure suit will retail at an
average price of around $1,500. A customer's measurements will be
faxed to Italy where all the work will be done. Delivery is promised
in 4 weeks.
   The Zegna store will stock off-the-rack suits ranging from $900
to $1,500 with free alterations done on the premises. If that's too
pricey for someone keen to buy into the Zegna image there will be
casual shirts for $60 to $65 and casual slacks for $225 to $250.
Ties go for about $85.
   Ermenegildo Zegna, named for his grandfather who built the
business and known simply as Gildo, says much of what makes the
company special is that it is still run by the founding family.
   The company, based in Trivero, Italy, oversees the production of
the wool and other raw materials that Zegna weaves into fabrics that
become clothing. To encourage sheep breeders to maintain or improve
the quality of their flocks, Zegna periodically awards prizes.
   Gildo Zegna said in an interview during a spring visit to New
York that the company aspires to growth but not to the extent that
it could jeopardize quality or image.
   ``In terms of distribution, we want to keep it very exclusive and
selective,'' he says. ``We are not interested to grow beyond a
certain point.''

<HEAD>Older Buyouts, New Problems Add Up To Trouble</HEAD>

   It's no longer unusual to see debt-financed
takeovers go bust soon after completion. But some older deals have
started to sour too, which shows that buying with borrowed money
carries risks that last for years.
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. went private in a $3.74 billion leveraged
buyout led by management in 1986, accomplished with bank loans and
sales of junk bonds, the risky high-yield securities that financed
the '80s takeover boom.
   Four years later, the retailer is $5.67 billion in debt, and,
after a disastrous Christmas shopping season, concerned creditors
are looking over its shoulder.
   Greyhound Lines Inc., the nation's biggest intercity bus company,
was taken private in 1987 by an investor group that paid $350
million and relied heavily on junk bonds for the purchase money.
   Last week, Greyhound, which has been hit hard by a
three-month-old drivers strike, filed for bankruptcy court
protection from creditors.
   The investors who bought these companies years ago never expected
to be in trouble at this late date. What went wrong?
   Too much debt and not enough margin for error and unexpected
problems _ the same things that have waylaid younger buyouts like
Campeau Corp.'s failed 1988 takeover of Federated Department Stores
Inc.
   Highly leveraged deals like these are ``fine as long as things go
well, but as soon as things go even slightly bad, the fallout
doesn't take very long to occur,'' said Jerome E. Hass, professor of
managerial economics and finance at Cornell University's Johnson
Graduate School of Management.
   ``These are deals that were exceedingly thin,'' Hass said.
   So when Macy suffered a loss at Christmas and Greyhound's fleet
was stalled by labor problems, the companies were short of cash
needed to pay bills, including hefty interest charges.
   Like many other highly leveraged firms, Macy and Greyhound did
not plan years ago for unexpected events.
   ``You kind of know what's going to happen in the next year, but
five years hence, you don't really know,'' said Robert W. Vishny, a
University of Chicago Graduate School of Business finance professor.
   ``It is a case where you are potentially setting yourself up for
trouble,'' Vishny said.
   Some of the shortsightedness comes from overly optimistic sales
earnings projections, particularly for retailers.
   Walter Loeb, a retailing analyst and consultant, said Macy had
budgeted for a 10 percent annual increase in sales, but like the
rest of the retail industry, has fallen far short of the mark.
   The Greyhound and Macy buyouts aren't the only older deals to
encounter rough sledding. Southland Corp., which went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buyout in 1987, recently said it was selling
out to a Japanese firm because it couldn't handle the debt load.
   Southland, like Macy and Campeau, is a retailer hit by declining
sales that it did not forecast. ``While it looks nice on paper, most
retailing LBOS have had a detrimental effect on the companies,''
Loeb said.
   But Macy exacerbated its problems by making a big acquisition
after its LBO.
   Macy spent more than $1 billion to buy two department store
chains from Campeau in 1988 after the two companies had fought one
another in a month-long takeover battle for Federated.
   Ironically, Macy had bid more for Federated than Campeau, which
ended up paying $6.6 billion for the retailer, plus another $2.2
billion in expenses. Campeau was unable to handle its debt bill, and
ultimately ended up in bankruptcy court.
   Greyhound, meanwhile, spent $80 million several months after its
own buyout to purchase assets of its competitor, Trailways Lines Inc.
   In hindsight, neither Macy nor Greyhound could really afford
their new acquisitions.
   Greyhound's problems will be resolved in bankruptcy court. The
estimates are it will take six months to a year to reorganize the
company.
   Macy, meanwhile, is expected to weather the storm on its own. The
company's latest quarterly earnings report, issued last week,
reassured junk bond investors.
   Loeb said Macy management, especially company chairman Edward
Finkelstein, has kept an open line of communications to suppliers,
creditors and investors.
   ``That was an asset,'' Loeb said.

   While Wall Street has dramatically changed its
view of the economic outlook in the past couple of months, it is
having trouble persuading the Federal Reserve to do the same.
   Analysts in the financial world have interpreted recent
statistics on the economy as showing a lot less growth than earlier
had been supposed.
   But the Fed has so far made no move to oblige bulls in the bond
and stock markets by adopting a more stimulative credit policy and
encouraging interest rates to keep falling.
   The central bank has sent out a variety of signals in recent days
that it isn't gravely worried about any impending recession, in
spite of stagnating employment growth over the last three months.
   Instead, it still seems to be more concerned with keeping the
brakes on inflation, even with recent evidence that upward pressures
on the cost of living have eased.
   ``The latest economic data move the Fed closer to an easing of
monetary policy, but it is unlikely that such a move will take place
before the third quarter,'' say economists at the investment firm of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Fed has made no change for more than 15 months in its
discount rate _ the charge it sets on loans to private financial
institutions, and its most publicized tool for influencing changes
in the flow of money and credit through the banking system. It has
stood at 7 percent since Feb. 24, 1989.
   In a further reflection of the steady-as-she-goes approach by
taken by Chairman Alan Greenspan, the interest rate on federal
funds, or overnight loans between banks, has hovered around 8.25
percent since January of this year.
   To some, this stands as evidence that the Fed has found the
correct way to keeping the economy on a path of slow growth despite
such disrupting influences as the savings and loan crisis.
   At the same time, it has attracted a steady stream of criticism
from people in both government and private business who contend that
the economy is expanding too slowly.
   As hopes ebbed on Wall Street for an early move toward stimulus
by the Fed, stock prices tumbled, giving up some of the gains that
carried the market to record highs as recently as Monday. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 38.59 to 2,862.38.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.98 to 196.05;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost 1.27
to 460.87, and the American Stock Exchange market value index was
down 2.66 at 361.17.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 168.46 million shares a day,
against 172.62 million the week before.
   If the Fed is going to get more accommodative, many analysts
believe, it could do so in early July once policymakers get a look
at another set of employment statistics.
   The chances for such a change might be further enhanced with
favorable readings on the consumer price index for May and June.
   ``If the CPI is moderate for another month or two, the monetary
authorities are likely to lower the target on the federal funds rate
by a notch or two to signal their intent to support the expansion,''
said Richard Rippe at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Traders in the bond and stock markets indeed appear to be banking
on significantly improved inflation news.
   Says William Melton at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis:
``Our belief is that the stage is being set for a spell of inflation
around 3 percent _ a welcome relief after the 8.5 percent annualized
rate during the first quarter.''

<HEAD>Bankers and Gorby Missed Each Other, But It May Be Just As Well</HEAD>

   It was almost as if San Francisco's
legendary fog invaded the conference where banking authorities from
22 nations were talking about the economic future of Eastern Europe.
The man responsible for sweeping changes there appeared in the same
hotel but the bankers never saw him.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev failed to take advantage of
the gathering of some of the world's most powerful commerical and
government bank officials at the International Monetary Conference
this past week. Instead, he tried to drum up investment from
California business leaders.
   Organizers of the annual gathering of about 200 bankers said they
spoke to Soviet Embassy officials in Washington about scheduling an
appearance by Gorbachev, who stopped in California after his summit
with President Bush. But the bankers never received a reply.
   Several conference participants said they believed the Soviet
leader blew an important opportunity to discuss his nation's need
for investment with those holding the keys to the vaults.
   But an address by Gorbachev to the bankers may have fallen on
deaf ears anyway. Several prominent conference participants said the
Soviet Union has a long way to go in restructuring its economy
before Western financiers would feel comfortable investing there.
   At a news conference, top officials of the central banks of
Japan, England, France and the United States were asked what lessons
they had learned from their large loans to South America in the
1970s, many of which have gone sour.
   Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said the
principal lesson is that a nation must have made substantial
capitalist economic reforms to be considered a suitable candidate
for bank loans.
   Larosiere said Mexico was a good example of a borrower that has
taken such major steps as selling off government-owned industry and
loosening regulation of business. He said the West must press
Eastern Europe to enact similar reforms.
   That thought was echoed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
in an address before the bankers.
   ``The countries that move forcefully to privatize state-owned
operations, to open trading and investment regimes and to withdraw
the government from the marketplace will be the ones tht attract the
capital to fuel growth,'' Brady said.
   Takeshi Ohta, a deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, said loans
by government-sponsored banks such as the World Bank may be needed
before private banks feel secure in committing their money to the
former communist nations.
   But Brady indicated that little additional aid to Eastern Europe
would come from the U.S. government. He told the bankers that they
must be willing to lend money to these countries despite concerns
about credit risk.
   ``As more countries embrace the principles of economic freedom,
creditors will need to stand ready to lend their support,'' he said.
``You in this room cannot simply be bystanders to this process.''
   Two former top government financial officials said the U.S.
should do its part to free up capital needed by Eastern Europe by
trimming the federal deficit, which is financed by Treasury
borrowing that could be going elsewhere.
   Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker told the
bankers that the United States must curb domestic spending, both
public and private, according to a text of his remarks in the
closed-door sessions.
   Volcker also said that nations _ particularly the United States _
must take steps to increase the rate of savings, which will boost
the amount of money available for borrowing by the former Soviet
bloc.
   Nigel Lawson, former chancellor of the Exchequer in Great
Britain, seconded Volcker's plea for greater private savings.
   He said governments must stop draining away investment funds by
running budget deficits, according to a copy of his remarks. Lawson
did not specifically mention the United States.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _Bankruptcy court was the forum for more debt-distressed
companies. Greyhound Lines sought Chapter 11 protection from
creditors, partly the result of a prolonged strike. Ames Department
Stores Inc. said it would close nearly a third of its 679 outlets,
reflecting the discounter's efforts to dump money-losing operations
since seeking bankruptcy court refuge in April.
   _ConAgra Inc. will acquire Beatrice Co. for $1.34 billion from
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The deal represents the last chunk of
what had been a much larger Beatrice bought by Kohlberg in 1986, and
will make ConAgra one of the world's biggest food companies.
   _General Motors Corp. outdid competitors and won a $1 billion,
five-year agreement to supply parts to the Soviet Union's auto
industry. The deal is one of the largest by a Western company in the
East bloc.
   _Flamboyant developer Donald J. Trump faced growing pressure from
lenders feeling queasy about his debt-ridden complex of casinos,
hotels and other property. Despite increased speculation that Trump
will be forced to sell assets in order to pay bills, aides said none
of his Atlantic City hotels were for sale.
