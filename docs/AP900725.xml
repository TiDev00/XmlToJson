   One of the abductors of Scott Heimdal, the
American gold miner who was kidnapped in Ecuador's jungle on April
28 and freed after 61 days in captivity, has been arrested, police
said Wednesday.
   They identified him as a member of a Colombian guerrilla group
who lived in neighboring Ecuador and said he was tied in with a
Colombian drug trafficker who was freed from prison by a guerrilla
attack.
   The police communique said, ``According to our investigations,
the kidnappers of Scott Heimdal are Roberto Andres Moreno (and) his
brother Ruben Dario, who are members of the People's Liberation
Army, and Luis Pablo Tobar, a drug trafficker freed from the prison
of Tena.''
   In his hometown of Peoria, Ill., Heimdal said he had no way of
knowing if those arrested were responsible for his kidnapping, and
questioned whether they would ever be found.
   ``Those names mean nothing to me,'' Heimdal said in a telephone
interview Wednesday night. ``I suppose it's possible, but not very.
The jungle's a very, very big place. The only way I would know if
it were them is if I saw a photograph.''
   Heimdal said the name of the group that kidnapped him is the
Popular Liberation Army, not the People's Liberation Army named in
the police report.
   The police report said the brothers are from Ecuador and that
Tobar is Colombian. Only Roberto Andres Moreno has been arrested,
the report said. It gave his brother's name only as Ruben Dario.
   The People's Liberation Army operates along the Colombia-Ecuador
border on the western edge of the Amazon rain forest.
   The communique gave no details of the arrest.
   It said, however, that Roberto Moreno had kept in contact with
Tobar when Tobar was imprisoned in Tena, a village in Ecuador's
eastern jungle.
   Colombian guerrillas attacked the prison in August 1988 and
freed Tobar and other four Colombian drug traffickers, according to
officials reports. Two police officers were killed.
   Heimdal's captors asked for ransom money to press their fight
against the Colombian government.
   Heimdal, 28, was released June 29 after his family paid a ransom
of $60,000. Most of the money came from donations from his hometown.
   Heimdal's parents came to Ecuador to secure his release
following secret negotiations. They all left Quito for Peoria on
July 2.
   Last April 28, a band of men wearing camouflage uniforms and
carrying assault rifles seized Heimdal when he was in a canoe
Heimdal was traveling on the Bermeja River. The kidnapping took
place in the jungle about five miles from the Colombian border and
100 miles northeast of Quito.
   Heimdal had been working with IMINCO, a gold mining company,
since October. He operated electronic equipment to locate gold
deposits on the river bottom, and also oversaw construction of a
large dredge.

<HEAD>Departing Red Army Soldiers Selling Arms, Police Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet armed forces may be leaving
Hungary but it seems some of their weapons are staying behind.
   There have been persistent reports of illegal traffic in
firearms from a district of the capital that is home to a Russian
base, the Magyar Hirlap newspaper reported Tuesday.
   It said it had learned that a heavy machine gun that can be
mounted on an armored vehicle sells for $1,500 and a machine gun
can be had for between $50 and $410. Bullets usually cost just over
a penny apiece.
   The newspaper, quoting police sources, said that in one incident
a Red Army soldier reported having been approached last month by a
Hungarian man and a woman who said they wanted to buy his AK-47
assault rifle.
   Soviet military authorities alerted Hungarian police, who found
out that the would-be buyers were a Hungarian bricklayer and a
prostitute. The two were detained and then released since they
could not be charged with any crime, the newspaper said.
   The paper quoted local precinct police chief Capt. Arpad Szabadi
as saying two Hungarian soldiers were caught recently with duffel
bags filled with automatic pistol parts that they said they bought
from Soviet soldiers.

<HEAD>News Agency Says More Than 43,000 Germans Died in Soviet Camps
After War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 43,000 Germans died in Soviet
internment camps that were set up in what is now East Germany after
World War II, the East Germany news agency ADN says.
   Nearly all of them died of illnesses such as tuberculosis, the
agency said in a report Tuesday.
   The news agency said its report was based on information
obtained by East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel
during a visit to Soviet Union. More than 122,000 Germans were
interned by the Soviets from 1945 to 1950, the agency said, and of
those, 42,889 died of sickness and 756 were condemned to death by a
military court.
   Another 12,770 were deported to the Soviet Union, and 6,680 were
transferred to prisoner of war camps, ADN said, without
elaborating. The others were released or escaped, the news agency
added.
   Georgi Kynin, deputy head of the division for diplomatic history
in Moscow's Foreign Ministry, was quoted as saying the camps were
necessary to remove fascism and militarist elements from German
society.
   He said the number of prisoners executed accounted for less than
1 percent of those interned.
   He said 4 million Soviet soldiers had died in Nazi concentration
camps.

<TEXT>
   An African National Congress
leader who returned from exile under a government grant of immunity
has reportedly been detained by police for questioning in an
investigation of guerrilla activities, an ANC spokesman said
Thursday.
   Chief ANC spokesman Ahmed Kathrada said he received information
from a reliable source Wednesday night about the detention of Mac
Maharaj, a fellow member of the ANC's 35-person National Executive
Committee.
   Maharaj, who is affiliated with the South African Communist
Party, was among the first of the exiled ANC leaders to return to
South Africa this spring after the white-minority government
legalized the black nationalist movement. He had worked at the
ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   President F.W. de Klerk granted temporary immunity from
prosecution to members of the ANC's executive committee to allow
them to return to the country for negotiations. The immunity
covered past offenses, but not activities considered illegal since
the exiles' return.
   Kathrada would not reveal the source for his information about
Maharaj's detention, but described it as reliable.
   Dozens of ANC guerrillas who recently infiltrated the country
have been arrested, according to South African press reports.
Police say they have seized weapons including grenade launchers,
mines and combat rifles.
   Many of those arrested are being held under the Internal
Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial.
   Kathrada said the ANC will discuss the recent wave of arrests
with the government and reiterated his organization's objections to
the Internal Security Act.
   Police spokesmen were unable early Thursday to confirm the
report of Maharaj's arrest. They have not named any of the others
detained for questioning in the investigation of ANC guerrilla
activities.
   The ANC's internal chairman Walter Sisulu has said that 150 ANC
members have been arrested recently and that the detentions go
against the spirit of the talks held between the ANC and the
government in May.
   The ANC has confirmed that its guerrillas continue to infiltrate
South Africa, but denies police and media reports of an ANC plot to
seize power if political negotiations fail.
   
   The ANC supports a guerrilla campaign against the white-led
government, but it has not carried out any major attacks this year.
   
   The ANC, the country's leading black opposition group, says it
will not suspend or call off its ineffective armed struggle until a
formal treaty is negotiated with the government.
   
   De Klerk has rejected demands by conservative whites that he
break off talks with the ANC because of the reported guerrilla
activities.
   De Klerk says he will meet Aug. 6 with Nelson Mandela and other
top ANC leaders to try and clear the way for negotiations on
sharing political power with the black majority.
   
   The ANC says that before formal constitutional negotiations can
begin the government must allow 20,000 ANC exiles to return without
fear of arrest and release some 3,000 people convicted of
politically motivated crimes. On Wednesday night, Mandela praised
thousands of armed men and boys for defending their neighborhoods
in a township where at least 21 people died this week in fighting
between black factions.
   ``You have the support of the ANC in everything that you do,''
the leader of the African National Congress told the crowd of
2,000, who waved spears, axes, sticks and chairlegs and chanted
``ANC!'' in the township of Sebokeng.
   Mandela pleaded for Sebokeng to return to normal after three
days of fighting, arson, street blockades, work and school boycotts.
   Residents and police say at least 21 people died Sunday after
members of the Zulu-based Inkatha party headed by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi staged a rally in Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg.
   Armed Inkatha members left the rally and clashed with township
residents, who were warned for days by ANC leaders that Inkatha
planned to attack them. Fighting continued sporadically Tuesday
night and spread to neighboring Evaton.
   Mandela, deputy president of the ANC, said Sebokeng was an ANC
stronghold, and blamed the violence on Inkatha. ``We are happy to
note that you made a stand against the thugs and killers who came
from outside in order to kill our people,'' he told the angry crowd
of young blacks.
   The Inkatha vs. ANC violence has killed 5,000 people in Natal
province the past five years. The Sebokeng battle was the worst
outbreak of the feud outside Natal.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, but differ on ways to
fight racial segregation in South Africa.

<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Arthur, with heavy rains and wind up
to 70 mph, strengthened Wednesday and forecasters warned that it
could turn into a hurricane threatening parts of Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic.
   The Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch for the
south coast of the island after Arthur pushed across the Windward
Islands and into the Caribbean Sea. A similar watch was in effect
for the south coast of Puerto Rico.
   Forecasters said a hurricane watch could be issued for parts of
those areas late Wednesday.
   Arthur was expected to ``remain very near to hurricane
intensity'' through early Thursday without reaching sustained winds
of 74 mph that would classify it as a hurricane, said Mark Zimmer,
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   ``We think that there is more than a 50-50 percent chance that
it won't become a hurricane,'' he said. ``But there is certainly
the chance that in the next 12 to 18 hours it could go ahead and
reach hurricane intensity.''
   At 10 p.m. EDT, Arthur was centered near latitude 14.2 north and
longitude 65.5 west, or about 420 miles southeast of Santo Domingo,
Dominican Republic. It was moving northwest at about 15 mph and was
expected to continue that motion through the next day or two, said
Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane center.
   Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm,
grew from a tropical depression, the second of the 1990 season,
that formed Sunday in the open Atlantic. The hurricane season runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   The two Koreas signed a historic
agreement Thursday setting up the first meetings between prime
ministers of the hostile states since the Korean peninsula was
divided more than 40 years ago.
   The 19-point agreement calls for meetings in Seoul from Sept.
4-7 to discuss the easing of political and military confrontations,
multilateral exchanges and cooperation on the divided peninsula.
   A second meeting is to be held in the Communist North Korean
capital of Pyongyang from Oct. 16-19.
   ``This precious fruit will open a decisive chapter in a road to
ending national division and achieving peaceful unification,'' said
Song Han-ho, the chief South Korean delegate.
   ``We can no longer shun the changing international situation,''
he said. ``We should rather actively respond to this and use it as
an opportunity to pursue national prosperity and forging a new
history.''
   Representatives of both countries signed the agreement in the
truce village of Panmunjom inside the 2{-mile-wide Demilitarized
Zone separating the two Koreas.
   Later Thursday, five North Koreans arrived on the northern side
of the border, presumably in preparation to cross into South Korea.
   A delay in their arrival, however, was first blamed on bad
weather and later on last-minute meetings. South Korean officials
finally said there were indications the crossing might be called
off, but they did not elaborate.
   The North Koreans would be the first to cross the border with
the approval of both governments since 1985, when dozens of
separated family members were allowed brief reunions.
   The North Koreans were scheduled to take part in a two-day
conference with South Korean opposition activists to discuss plans
for an unprecedented joint rally calling for unification of their
divided peninsula. Both nations desire unification but on their own
terms.
   Three South Korean dissidents were allowed into the border
security area to wait for the North Koreans, while dozens of others
prepared to welcome them a few miles away.
   ``Let's become one nation!'' and ``Tear down the iron wall of
division'' read placards at the welcome site. About 100 radical
students sang solidarity songs while awaiting the North Koreans.
   Twelve riot police buses were parked in the area, but police
remained out of sight.
   South Korean dissidents said the unification rally was expected
to be held in Panmunjom on Aug. 15 _ a sentimental holiday on both
sides of the border celebrating the 1945 liberation of Korea after
35 years of Japanese colonial rule.
   The rally would mark the first contact between civilian
organizations of the two Koreas. In the past, South Korean
authorities have blocked such contacts out of fear they could turn
into radical anti-government protests.
   The planned prime ministers' meetings and the unification rally
could serve as indicators of the future course of relations between
Communist North Korea and pro-Western South Korea _ bitter enemies
for more than four decades.
   The Korean peninsula was divided after World War II, and two
separate governments were formed in 1948. North and South Korea
fought a three-year war that ended in 1953. No peace treaty has
been signed and they are still technically at war.
   By signing the accord for a prime ministers meeting, North Korea
grants tacit recognition to the legitimacy of the Seoul government,
a recognition denied since 1948.
   Prime Ministers Kang Young-hoon of South Korea and Yon Hyung Muk
of North Korea are considered figureheads in their respective
governments with limited policy-making roles.
   But their meeting is symbolically significant because it would
be the highest-level contacts ever between the two rival states.
   The most powerful figures in the two countries are President Roh
Tae-woo of South Korea and Kim Il Sung, the North Korean president
and Communist leader.
   Despite sporadic talks on exchanges and easing tension, there
has been little real progress in improving relations between the
Koreas.
   The Korean border is one of the most heavily fortified in the
world. More than 1.5 million troops are deployed on both sides.
There is no mail, travel or other communication between the two
sides.
   Last week, Roh proposed that the border be opened for five days
in mid-August on a trial basis, allowing people on both sides free
travel.
   North Korea rejected Roh's proposal, but has said it is willing
to open the border on a limited basis on Aug. 15 to Koreans
desiring unification. The North also demanded that Seoul scrap its
anti-Communist national security laws and release prisoners jailed
for promoting unification.

<TEXT>
   The new summertime movie thriller,
``Arachnophobia,'' is bugging Dr. Michael H. Robinson, a spider
expert who accuses Hollywood of spinning a web of deceit about his
favorite creepy-crawly.
   ``It's a pity to give spiders a bad name,'' says Robinson,
director of the National Zoo and former director of the American
Arachnological Society. ``It's very sad that we should be so
irrational about them and see movies that reinforce all those
ancient, primitive fears about spiders.''
   Robinson, an English-born biologist, spent 20 years studying
spiders in Panama, Papua New Guinea and more than a dozen other
tropical countries. He was outraged when he saw a newspaper
advertisement for the Steven Spielberg-Frank Marshall movie about a
monstrous vampire spider that terrorizes a California family.
   ``Eight legs, two fangs and an attitude,'' the ad reads. It's
``Jaws with legs,'' warns one film critic.
   ``Arachnophobia,'' which means ``fear of spiders,'' is about a
huge Venezuelan spider that hitchhikes in a coffin to a small town
in California. Besides breeding an army of deadly offspring, it
leaps to sink its fangs into human victims, paralyzing them in
seconds with a lethal neurotoxin and sucking their bodies dry.
   Robinson immediately summoned a reporter to issue a protest.
   ``This bloody movie is making horrific allegations about
spiders, and they are so important to the ecology of the world and
so incredibly beneficial to mankind that I decided they need some
good press,'' he said.
   Robinson hailed spiders as nature's pest exterminator, ridding
the Earth of billions and billions of houseflies, roaches,
mosquitoes and other insects every year.
   Without spiders, he said, human beings would be overwhelmed by
winged creatures that would destroy crops and threaten to leave the
planet virtually uninhabitable.
   ``Ordinary spiders are perfectly harmless and they are marvelous
friends to have around the house,'' Robinson said.
   If they give you a severe case of the shudders, he said, simply
cover them with a water glass, slide a sheet of paper underneath
and carry them safely outside the house. Don't stomp on them or
flush them down the toilet, he pleaded.
   Not only are spiders great for gobbling pests, Robinson said,
but they are wonderful objects of scientific study.
   ``The sex life of spiders is absolutely bizarre,'' he said.
   A lot of the details can't be published in a family newspaper,
but Robinson speaks in awed tones of the antenna-like things on a
male spider's forehead that suck up sperm deposits like
old-fashioned fountain pens.
   In his elaborate courtship ritual, he said, the male spins a
silk ``mating thread'' and serenades his female friend by strumming
it like a guitar. And during their nuptial embrace, he said,
``every hair stands on end _ it's quite exciting to see.''
   Of the thousands of spider species in the world, Robinson said,
only three are poisonous to humans _ the black widow, the brown
recluse and the dreaded Australian funnel web spider, or Atrax
robustus, which is ``very aggressive'' and whose repeated bites
will kill a person within a few hours.
   The tarantulas used in filming ``Arachnophobia'' actually are
pretty innocuous, Robinson said. Their main weapon is not their
venom, which is no more dangerous than a bee sting, but their
ability to launch clouds of barbed hairs that produce an irritating
skin rash.
   The American Association of Poison Control Centers says it has
reports of only two human fatalities from spider bites in the
United States in a recent three-year period. Both involved elderly
people with medical complications, a spokeswoman said.
   Even Little Miss Muffett had nothing to fear from spiders.
   Robinson said the nursery rhyme heroine was a real-life little
girl named Patience Muffett, who not only shared her seat with
spiders but apparently ate them, too.
   Her father was Dr. Thomas Muffett, a 16th century English
physician who frequently prescribed pills containing spiders to
treat his patients, including Patience.

   David Souter's start in upholding the law
came at Concord High School, where classmates pegged the popular
member of the hall traffic squad as destined for bigger and better
things.
   Their prediction has proven true _ Souter is a Senate
confirmation away from one of the nation's highest honors, a seat
on the Supreme Court.
   Yet it appears his meteoric rise in the legal community has done
little to change the man whom classmate John Prowse remembers from
his traffic squad days.
   ``I guess that was the first enforcement duty that he had and
let me tell you, he was good at it,'' Prowse said in an interview
Tuesday.
   ``Soutie,'' as Souter's classmates called him, still lives in
the same house he grew up in, a modest clapboard and shingled
building tucked away on a tiny dirt road in Weare, a town of 4,500
people a dozen miles from Concord.
   And judging from the praise being heaped on him from fellow
lawyers and judges, he is viewed no differently now than 33 years
ago, when Concord's Class of '57 voted him most sophisticated, most
literary and most likely to succeed.
   The life of the 50-year-old bachelor now is most likely to be
dissected, as the Senate prepares for confirmation hearings and
interest groups involved in the abortion debate and other
contentious issues scour Souter's record for hints of how he might
vote as a Supreme Court justice.
   Friends and associates say people will find that Souter the man
is much like Souter the boy _ modest, considerate, frugal,
studious, humorous and anything but controversial. He has a small
circle of friends, choosing instead to spent much of his time
alone, studying and interpreting the law. His breaks for recreation
are spent hiking the hills and mountains of New Hampshire, his home
since age 11.
   ``I'm very happy to go off alone,'' Souter once said.
   Prowse remembers his boyhood friend ``as one of the rare people
who transcended all the cliques in high school _ we called them the
jocks and the brains back then. Everyone thought very highly of
him.''
   He was an honor student, student council member and yearbook
staffer, beginning his lifelong hobbies of collecting books and
stamps while gaining a reputation as an intellectual.
   Friends say Souter balances his bookwormish image with a biting
sense of humor.
   On one of his few not-so-good days at high school, a teacher
returned a paper to Souter with the admonition it was so bad ``he
should take it home and wrap the garbage with it,'' Prowse says.
   ``I'm not in the habit of wrapping my garbage in bond paper,''
was Souter's quick retort, according to Prowse, who said his friend
meant no disrespect but often used his dry wit to break up school
monotony.
   Prowse laughs today at a yearbook reference that Souter enjoyed
``giving and attending scandalous parties.''
   ``This was the 1950s, when scandalous meant that the parents
weren't home,'' Prowse said. ``Pot then was something you put on
the stove and grass was something that you mowed. And most of us
didn't have our first beer until we were in the military or
sophomores in college.''
   Friends now say Souter rarely stays long at social functions,
generally saying he needs to go home to work. That's where the
White House found him Sunday, tucked away in the house that could
easily be mistaken for vacant, its mailbox listing to the left, its
paint chipping and a doghouse out back all but overrun with high
grass.
   His love of the outdoors is easily understandable. The roads
leading to the house offer a stunning view of the state's rolling
hills; the nighttime sky is breathtaking.
   Souter's dedication to his work, friends say, can be traced to
his youth, when he often lingered so long at New Hampshire
Historical Society exhibits that he had to be asked to leave.
   He exhibited similar commitment during stints as an overseer of
Dartmouth Medical School and as a board member and president of
Concord Hospital, colleagues say.
   ``I never worked so hard in my life than when he was here,''
said the hospital's current president, Richard Warner. But while
serving as master of ceremonies for a retirement party, Souter
``displayed the most fantastic, dry sense of humor that you can
imagine.''
   Souter lived with his mother most of his life but she now
resides in nearby Concord in a retirement home. Now 82, she takes
his confirmation for granted and says she will miss his frequent
visits.
   The nomination has brought a gush of pride to New Hampshire.
   At Cinder's Country store, a few miles from Souter's home, an
outdoor sign promoting the pizza was rearranged Tuesday so a new
message could be added in the middle: ``Good Luck David Souter!''

   He haunts the forbidding jungles of
south India with his band of thieves, slaughtering elephants for
their ivory and smuggling tons of fragrant sandalwood. Police want
him for the murders of 20 policemen and forest officers.
   Residents in this poor village of iron-red earth worship him as
a Robin Hood and priest. He's built them temples, stocked a
reservoir with fish and attends wedding ceremonies incognito,
presenting newlyweds with gifts.
   He appears to have friends in high places and once escaped
police custody, reportedly by paying a $17,000 bribe.
   His only name is Veerappan. The 38-year-old outlaw is India's

   In April, after the killings of four police officers, two
southern states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu formed a task force of
more than 800 officers to catch him. The manhunt, Operation Snap,
is the biggest in India's 43 years as an independent country.
   The investigation in Karnataka is led by K.U. Shetty, a
51-year-old inspector general of police who has vowed to capture
the outlaw alive.
   In addition to hundreds of officers, Shetty is using two
helicopters, night vision devices, jeeps, automatic weapons and
high-tech communications equipment. The operation recently took
over Veerappan's hometown of Gopinatham, turning the local
elementary school into its headquarters.
   In Tamil Nadu, Superintendent of Police Krishnaswami
Gopalakrishnan wants Veerappan dead. Gopalakrishnan, a 36-year-old
former karate instructor with a penchant for gold chains, has
formed a band of 14 highly trained men _ dubbed ``The Liquidators''
_ for the task.
   ``I don't need all that fancy stuff like helicopters,'' he said
in an interview several days after emerging from a three-week hunt
in the jungle. ``We're just going to blow him away.''
   Gopalakrishnan's men recently gave him a brass statue of Sir
Lancelot, the legendary British knight, ``to motivate me to slay
this dragon,'' he said with a loud laugh.
   So far, Veerappan remains on the lam in the forests, often
sleeping in two places during the night.
   Known for his thick black mustache and protruding adam's apple,
Veerappan had a jungle wedding in January to a shepherd's teen-age
daughter.
   Soon afterward, Veerappan allegedly killed again in his
hometown. While more than 250 officers slept in barracks 50 feet
away, someone crept into the house of an alleged police informant
at 3:15 a.m. and shot him as he slept.
   Police call Veerappan a one-man ecological disaster. In his two
decades in the jungle, they say he has killed 500 elephants for
their tusks and smuggled out thousands of tons of sandalwood, which
is used for oils, soap and furniture. It is sent mostly to the
Middle East.
   The main problem in catching Veerappan is that few villagers are
willing to help, police say.
   When they do, horrible things happen.
   In January 1989, Veerappan invited five men whom he suspected
were police informers to a village feast. As they washed their
hands before the meal, police say Veerappan stood behind them with
an elephant gun and fired. His men later chopped the bodies into
pieces and floated them down the nearby Cauvery River in gunny
sacks.
   ``I will say nothing about Veerappan except that he's a good man
and pays well,'' said Kumar Gounder, an elderly villager in
Gopinatham who cuts sandalwood for the fugitive. ``When my child
was sick he gave me medicine.''
   Numerous news reports say Veerappan and his smuggling ring are
linked to officials in Karnataka state who profit from his schemes.
   In November 1986, a forest service officer captured Veerappan
while he was shopping for weapons in a gun store in Bangalore,
Karnataka's capital. He turned Veerappan over to police. A few days
later Veerappan escaped.
   Police at the time said he oiled his hands and slipped off his
handcuffs. Subsequent news reports said Veerappan paid thousands of
dollars to gain his freedom.
   Veerappan started his career as an apprentice to a legendary
elephant poacher, who abandoned crime 10 years ago after his son
became a judge.
   Veerappan's parents were farmers, tilling the poor earth around
the Kollegal Forest. Just a few generations earlier, his people
lived in the jungle as members of the nomadic Padiachi Gounder
tribe.
   A lack of opportunity in Gopinatham turned Veerappan and his two
brothers to crime. Police have already jailed his brothers on
murder and robbery charges.
   Only when authorities linked Veerappan and his men to the deaths
of police officers did the manhunt begin in earnest.
   But there has been criticism of the operation to hunt down
Veerappan. Karnataka's state assembly recently debated a proposal
to disband the task force because it was making little progress.
   Gopalakrishnan also has voiced concern that his colleagues on
the other side of the state border are not aggressive enough.
   ``What do you mean, they arrested them?'' he said after learning
of the recent capture of two alleged gang members. ``The job is to
liquidate them.''

<HEAD>Castro Sees Merit in Higher Pay for Some Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuba may tout itself as a bastion of Communism in
the Western hemisphere, but there's evidence of creeping
capitalism: Fidel Castro is an enthusiastic advocate of bigger
paychecks for workers in key areas of the economy.
   The Cuban president and revolutionary leader, faced with cuts in
Soviet aid that will force his country to sink or swim, has come a
long way from the view that workers could be induced by moral
suasion to increase their output.
   In a recent speech, Castro railed against what he called
technocrats who had the ``crazy idea'' that farm workers would
exert themselves while earning 80 pesos a month, less than $70.
   He expressed admiration for the way in which the most developed
capitalist countries, such as Japan, have been able to maintain
high production by subsidizing farm income.
   He said farmers should be paid whatever is required for them to
produce more. In the past, Castro has resisted using increased pay
to boost production, arguing that other alternatives must be
explored.
   Cuba also is experimenting with a new system under which workers
in key sectors such as tourist hotel construction can earn more
than doctors and other professionals.
   Cuban officials now believe the surest path out of the current
economic crisis is through increased tourism from countries with
convertible currencies _ Canada, West Germany, Spain and Italy.
   To speed construction at some tourism projects, workers get not
only premium pay but also easier access to prized appliances such
as color televisions.
   They are not asked to perform off-hours ``volunteer'' work, a
common practice in Cuba, and they get to live in quarters far more
comfortable than the average Cuban, officials say.
   The work is arduous, the laborers live away from their families
but the material rewards are substantial.
   A Cuban journalist said the perquisites offered to these workers
are such that there have been angry clashes with less privileged
workers.
   But Castro apparently feels that a bit of class warfare is a
small price to pay if it means that Cuba will be able to reverse
its steady economic decline.
   The need for dollars has become more acute now that Cuba,
because of uncertainty over future economic dealings with the
Soviet Union, may need hard cash to meet its oil needs.
   Under an economic cooperation agreement, the Soviets provide
Cuba with about 90 million barrels of oil annually.
   Even in inflated dollars, the tourism income is only a fraction
of what it was during the last year before Castro came to power,
1958. The government is hoping for an increase of almost five-fold
in the number of tourists between now and 1995.
   Castro's reforms could boost production but they also carry the
risk of bringing to Cuba some of the ills of capitalist society.
   For example, laggard workers on some priority projects are
subject to dismissal, a penalty once unheard of.
   There also is a campaign to make companies self-financing and to
put an end to inflated payrolls _ an ailment that Castro says has
afflicted Cuba for all 31 years of the revolution.
   Reform of this type has meant an increase in unemployment. The
government has long since dropped the claim that every Cuban in the
labor force has a job. Throngs of people can be seen each day at
the government-run employment office.
   An added element in the reform campaign is that people are being
encouraged as never before to speak their minds about the
revolution's shortcomings.
   While constructive criticism is welcome nowadays, there is a low
tolerance threshold for Cubans who cross the line of criticism into
opposition. For these Cubans, the price often is imprisonment.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Souter Nomination Temporarily Defuses Abortion
Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's first appointment to the
Supreme Court _ and the speed of the announcement _ are helping him
score points with conservatives and moderates while temporarily
defusing the emotional abortion argument.
   Moderates generally seem comfortable with the fact that David H.
Souter, although billed as a conservative, has left no paper trail
yet as a federal appeals court judge, particularly on the abortion
issue.
   And conservatives seem to be rejoicing in the mere fact that
Souter came with a strong recommendation from White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu.
   Since Sununu is the Republican right wing's unofficial liaison
with the White House, his seal of approval must mean that Souter's
conservative credentials are impeccable, the reasoning goes.
   And while Bush has sought to minimize Sununu's role in Souter's
selection, senior White House officials suggest privately that the
former New Hampshire governor's role was one of direct advocacy for
the man he placed on his state Supreme Court in 1983.
   Bush's quick naming of Souter caught abortion rights activists
and opponents off guard, cutting off any efforts on their part to
mount massive pre-nomination lobbying campaigns.
   But at the same time, some White House officials privately have
voiced concern that the president's rapid naming of Souter _ mainly
with only Sununu vouching for him _ has short-circuited the system
of elaborate background checks.
   Although his background was routinely checked when he was
nominated earlier this year to the federal appeals court in Boston,
he as yet has not received the degree of scrutiny to which other
high-level appointees have been subject.
   And, while Souter's lifestyle seems spartan and his judicial
views seem strict constructionist, some administration
conservatives suggest there is a high potential for surprise once
Souter is on the bench.
   Bush for the time being seems to be having it both ways with the
appointment _ not alienating either conservatives or moderates. And
it isn't the first time his administration has been able to gloss
over a controversial subject and appease rival wings of the party
at the same time.
   For instance, Vice President Dan Quayle often seem at odds with
Bush on issues involving relations with the Soviet Union, taking a
harder-line stand.
   When that happens, spokesmen for both Bush and Quayle quickly
insist the two leaders are on the same wavelength _ when, in fact,
Quayle's words have been mainly designed for conservative audiences.
   Sununu has been known to practice the same verbal
sleight-of-hand.
   For instance, shortly after Bush entered budget negotiations
pledging there were ``no preconditions,'' Sununu was putting out
the word that the president likely would reject any tax proposal
made by Democrats.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disavowed Sununu's
comments, saying they didn't reflect the views of the president.
   But was Sununu in the doghouse? Not on your life. His words were
designed to provide a reassuring signal to conservatives that the
president wasn't about to abandon his opposition to new taxes.
   Of course, that was before Bush specifically revoked his ``no
new taxes'' pledge.
   On the abortion issue, Bush has managed to soften some of the
edges of his position even as he asserts that he's strongly
anti-abortion.
   Bush says he opposes government funding for any abortions other
than those to save the life of the mother. But he also says that if
there isn't government money involved supports a woman's right to
abortion in cases of rape or incest.
   Earlier in his career, Bush voiced support for the Roe Vs. Wade
Supreme Court ruling that he now says he would like to see
overturned.
   There has always been a perception among some women's groups
that first lady Barbara Bush does not share her president's
anti-abortion views.
   She declines to address the issue; but her silence only
reinforces that perception and further blurs the edges of Bush's
stance.
   This may have helped Bush escape some of the vitriol that
pro-choice activists have directed at other political leaders,
including former President Reagan, who oppose abortion rights.
   In the same way, Sununu's role in the selection of Souter for
the Supreme Court is enabling Bush to escape criticism from
anti-abortion activists who would have preferred a candidate with a
proven judicial anti-abortion record.
   Meanwhile, Bush has said his position has not changed on
abortion _ at least since the last time he changed it.
   But his record for standing by a position no longer has much
credibility _ even with Republican audiences _ since his about-face
on no new taxes.
   A GOP audience in Philadelphia laughed on Tuesday when he said
he was going to leave before the broccoli was served; but it howled
and applauded when he added: ``I'm going to stay with my position.
You know, I never change my position on anything.''

<HEAD>New Energy Taxes Would Hurt Farmers, Rural Residents, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move to impose energy taxes as a way of
trimming the federal budget deficit would severely hurt farmers and
small-town people, says the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association.
   Rural electric systems operate at cost and are owned by their
customers, said Bob Bergland, executive vice president of the
association. Any price increase caused by energy taxes would be
paid by consumers.
   ``Rural consumers can't escape,'' Bergland said Tuesday. ``They
are the equity owners of the electric systems which provide
electricity to them.''
   Bergland, who was secretary of agriculture in the Carter
administration, joined natural gas and electric utility leaders to
protest any move by the Bush administration to raise money by
imposing new energy taxes.
   One type of tax that has been suggested would base the tax on
the amount of carbon in the fuel. Coal, petroleum and natural gas
would be taxed, but nuclear, hydroelectric and solar energy would
not because they contain no carbon, an air pollutant.
   Still another plan would base the tax on the amount of energy,
measured in British thermal units, or BTUs, that a fuel contains.
The BTU tax would apply to all fuels.
   Bergland, whose member co-ops serve more than 25 million people,
said the rural economy has ``taken severe shocks'' the last decade
through droughts, floods, falling commodity prices, plummeting land
price and a sharp decline in federal funding for rural areas.
   ``Energy taxes will unfairly penalize rural areas which already
have higher electricity rates, either by driving up the price of
fuel used to generate electricity or by taxing the selling price of
electricity,'' he said.
   A joint statement protesting the use of energy taxes was signed
by Bergland; George Lawrence, president of the American Gas
Association; Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute;
and Larry Hobart, executive director of the American Public Power
Association.
   ``The burden of broad-based energy taxes will fall unevenly
across consumers and income classes, among industries and across
regions of the country,'' the statement said. ``This is unfair and
inequitable taxation.''
   BTU and carbon-content taxes were described as ``inherently
regressive.'' Such taxes were said capable of raising at least $14
billion a year.
   ``Heating, lighting, cooking and water heating are not luxuries
but essentials,'' the statement said. ``Lower-income families
already pay three to four times more of their income for energy
than the average American family.''

   The Agriculture Department is looking for a
better scarecrow and is ready to hire a top scientist to help
design one.
   That's not the exact reason, but it's close. The project is one
of six new post-doctoral research jobs USDA has created for studies
in plant and animal science.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the six scientists selected
will be able to work for two to four years. He said the salaries
range from $24,705 to $42,601 per year.
   Glosser said the objective is to obtain needed research in
support of the agency's regulatory programs. Another goal is to
attract first-rate scientific talent to the field of plant and
animal health.
   ``Contact with participants will continue to benefit us long
after the post-doctoral projects have been completed,'' he said.
   The bird-scaring project is located at the Monell Chemical
Senses Center at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.
   As the APHIS report explained, the project ``will study the
psychology, neurobiology, chemical ecology and analytical chemistry
involved in motivating birds to fly away and not come back.''
   Birds have become major pests on many farms, damaging
enterprises as diverse as fish farms, fruit orchards and grain
fields, the agency said. Existing devices don't do the job
effectively.
   More information and applications for the post-doctoral
positions are available from: USDA, APHIS, Recruitment and
Development, 236 Federal Building, Hyattsville, Md. 20782, or call

   Kiwifruit is a native of New Zealand and is
named after the country's national bird, the flightless kiwi.
   But a trade report by the Agriculture Department says Italy is
expected to become the world's leading producer of kiwifruit.
   Italian production was 210,000 metric tons in 1989, up 75
percent in just one year, said the report by the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service. That has caused a significant decline
in prices, despite rising domestic consumption.
   Exports have increased sharply, too, the report said. Other
European Community countries are major buyers, led by West Germany.

<HEAD>Barry Douglas, Richard Stoltzman Soloists at Mostly Mozart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a night of anomaly at the Mostly Mozart
Festival.
   A Cambridge-educated musician conducted Haydn's ``Oxford''
Symphony. A Mozart piano concerto was played with cadenzas nearly
200 years older than it. A clarinetist of remarkable talent showed
himself to be his own worst enemy.
   The concert Tuesday also raised an important issue: how a
performer's interpretation can cross the border into arrogance.
   The conductor was Mark Elder, and he was joined by Belfast-born
pianist Barry Douglas in the Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat, K.
482, and Richard Stoltzman in Mozart's A major Clarinet Concerto,
K. 622.
   Stoltzman, 48, a fixture at Mostly Mozart for more than a
decade, has joined that rare species: a wind-playing superstar,
like Jean-Pierre Rampal, Heinz Holliger or James Galway, in demand
with concert-bookers and a guaranteed sell-out.
   He is unquestionably one of the great clarinet players, known
for his ability to play incredibly softly, his smooth articulation,
his technique.
   But many clarinetists dislike him intensely, whether it be
jealousy, distaste at his crossover into jazz, wide vibrato (which
is unusual for a clarinetist), or highly personal interpretations.
   In the Mozart concerto Tuesday, his little additions of ornament
were reasonably tasteful. The large size of Avery Fisher Hall
smoothed over his vibrato. His excessive tonguing of fast notes was
acceptable, though sometimes distracting.
   But Stoltzman's taffy-chewing distortion of rhythm in an attempt
to be expressive was so severe that the music lost shape. Lines
didn't unfurl, they jerked back and forth, obscured by the
soloist's shadow. Mozart lost. Even the orchestra seemed tentative
at times.
   But another anomaly: Stoltzman played the slow movement, one of
Mozart's greatest, with surpassing serenity. He was simple, to the
point, and communicated directly with the audience.
   But Stoltzman, again trying to be different, broke the spell
with an ungainly, inappropriate sounding cadenza instead of the one
Mozart wrote for his clarinet quintet _ also in A major _ which is
traditionally played here.
   Cadenzas also figured prominently in the piano concerto. They
were by Benjamin Britten and had elements of Rachmaninoff and
Debussy. Despite the clash of periods, they are wonderful and
somehow fitting, and the 29-year-old Douglas seemed to play them
with particular affinity.
   Douglas arrived after winning the 1986 Tchaikovsky Competition
in Moscow as the first non-Russian since Van Cliburn and also is
given to unusual interpretations. He played the concerto with a
good deal of romance, inflecting phrases in a personal but not
excessive way.
   The conductor kept the orchestra in extremely close ensemble
with soloist. Elder, director of the English National Opera,
appropriately let the winds sing out, a good course in a concerto,
which is really chamber music for piano, strings and winds.
   Unlike Stoltzman, Douglas seemed weaker in the soulful slow
movement, his melodies having a too-dreamy, almost formless
quality. There was some particularly fine interplay with the
orchestra in the final Rondo. Douglas seemed really to be
listening. In all, it was a high-level, if not superlative,
performance.
   In the succeeding Symphony No. 92 in G major, nicknamed the
``Oxford,'' Elder brought out a larger range of colors than is
usually heard in Haydn, and better balanced the orchestra's
sections.

   He just flew across the Atlantic Ocean and boy,
are his arms tired. Dutch aviator Eppo Harbrink Numan isn't kidding
when he says it.
   Numan, 49, claims to be the first person to cross the Atlantic
in an ultralight aircraft.
   ``My arms were getting tired in the end,'' he said Tuesday at an
airport in suburban St. Hubert, where he landed Sunday from
northern Quebec.
   Unlike a conventional airplane, the motorized ultralight is
maneuvered using a horizontal bar, like a hang glider.
   Numan said he began his journey 11 weeks ago, leaving the
Netherlands for northern Scotland, then skipping to Iceland and
Greenland before arriving on Baffin Island Thursday.
   The aviator said the trip was to call attention to the
environment.
   He has campaigned for five years to get the United Nations to
establish international legislation to restore and protect the
environment. In March, he sold his cafe to help pay the $30,000
(U.S.) cost to make the flight.
   Numan said bad weather kept him on the ground repeatedly.
   The seven-hour flight over Greenland was the most spectacular
part of his flight, Numan said, and the toughest occurred in Quebec.
   Numan says the 4{-hour trip from Kuujjuaq, in Arctic Quebec, to
Schefferville, Quebec, included the worst turbulence of his journey.

   Miner John Dilla takes a swig of
cheap local gin, chews on betel nut, then covers his mouth with a
thin surgical mask before burrowing into a crevice in the rubble of
the once swank Hyatt Hotel.
   Dilla is among 200 volunteer gold miners still searching for
bodies, and possibly survivors, buried beneath twisted steel and
tons of concrete after the July 16 earthquake devastated nearly 30
buildings in this mountain resort.
   ``The miners are the real heroes of this operation,'' said Dave
Kemp, a member of the British International Rescue Corps. ``The job
they have done is simply excellent and very professional.''
   Kemp, a fireman from Norfolk, England, said Filipino miners had
done about 70 percent of the work of finding people beneath the
ruins in this city 130 miles north of Manila.
   Most foreign rescuers left last weekend after deciding there
were probably no more survivors in the ruins. Now, the miners,
along with a few daring civilians and Philippine Military Academy
cadets, are left with the job.
   ``They have committed to continue the search to the last body,''
said Rogelio Singson, a spokesman of presidential relief
coordination center for Baguio.
   Dilla said the miners need the gin to numb their sense of smell
as the stench of death grows stronger in the remains. Betel nuts
satisfy hunger pangs.
   He said the linen masks did little to lessen the stench of
decaying bodies. But he and others wear them all the same because
they are the only facial covering available.
   ``You will need a gas mask with an oxygen supply before you can
really work inside those tunnels. Otherwise, you will pass out
before you can reach deep inside,'' Dilla said. ``But since we lack
the equipment, we're using the best available resources.''
   Fellow miner Orlando Bay-os said they came to Baguio after
hearing reports about damage in the once swank resort. The miners
volunteered although their own camp at the Philex Mining Corp. was
also damaged.
   Twenty-one of their fellow miners and their families were killed
there.
   ``We proceeded to Baguio as soon as we heard the news that we
did not even have the time to check the condition of our
families,'' Bay-os said. ``There was a greater need for us in
Baguio.''
   Bay-os said most of the volunteer miners walked from their camp,
about 20 miles, to reach Baguio. Most have stayed since and have
been working for stretches of up to 48 hours to find people trapped
in the debris.
   Working side by side with the miners are the 1,000 cadets of the
Philippine Military Academy, whose campus is in Baguio. Eight cadet
companies formed the first organized search and rescue group in the
resort.
   ``We knew there was a lot of damage and there was nobody on deck
but us,'' said Cadet 3rd Class Keith Cardones. ``We had to decide
fast.''
   ``We were not prepared for a disaster but with just guts and our
bare hands we started the rescue attempt,'' Cadet 2nd Class Jun de
Vela said. ``We only realized the dangers of what were were doing
after experiencing being inside tunnels during the aftershocks.''
   Singson said he had received reports of how cadets took turns
entering a 12-inch-high space between a collapsed floor of the
Hotel Nevada to talk to a woman who was pinned down by a concrete
beam.
   He said that when an aftershock lowered the void even more, the
thinner cadets who could still enter the space took over. The woman
was saved.
   In another incident, the cadets joined several drinking straws
in a makeshift tube to allow another survivor to take in liquids
from a bottle several yards away, Singson said.
   But de Vela also spoke of the frustrations of not being able to
save people they knew were still alive for hours after the
earthquake.
   He said many cadets worked overtime after hearing the cries of
5-year-old Michelle Reyes, who was trapped on the fourth floor of
the Hyatt.
   He said that for two days the cadets were trying to talk with
the girl, who was crying from beneath the rubble. But after several
aftershocks, the crying stopped. Reyes's body was recovered days
later.
   ``It really hurt but we did the best we could,'' said de Vela.

<HEAD>Thatcher Refuses to Intervene in Rushdie Film Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has refused to
intervene in the row over a decision to ban a film that portrays
the death of author Salman Rushdie.
   The independent British Board of Film Classification has banned
the Pakistani film, ``International Guerrillas,'' on the grounds it
is criminally libelous of Rushdie.
   British Moslem groups have denounced the ban on the film and
accused the board of hypocrisy because Rushdie's book, ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which they say blasphemes Islam, was not banned.
   ``The Board is an entirely independent body,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said Tuesday. ``If the distributors ... wish to appeal against the
decision of the Board, they may make application to the Video
Appeals Committee in the usual way.''
   The prime minister was responding in the House of Commons to an
opposition lawmaker who accused her of ``double standards.''
   The distributor of the Punjabi-Urdu language film, Mohammed
Fayyaz of London, made an appeal to the Video Appeals Committee on
Monday to allow the film to be distributed.
   Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India and now a British
citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 1989 when the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran called for the author's death for
blaspheming Islam in ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The author said through his defense committee on Monday that he
would not initiate a libel action against the film and supports the
right of the film to be shown.
   The 3{-hour film depicts Rushdie as the agent of an
international conspiracy against Islam and shows him torturing and
killing Moslems until he himself is killed by a bolt of lightning.

<HEAD>Fed Chief: Bank Won't `Fritter Away' Gains in Inflation Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
seeking to reassure jittery financial markets, says the central
bank won't ``fritter away'' the gains made in the last few years in
the fight against inflation.
   Greenspan told lawmakers Tuesday that the Fed has not abandoned
its inflation battle as part of some deal with the Bush
administration to trim the federal budget deficit.
   He insisted that any move to lower interest rates to ward off
the adverse impacts of budget cuts and tax increases needed to
reduce the deficit would be made only ``in the context of not
inducing inflationary pressures.''
   Private economists saw Greenspan's comments as an effort to calm
fears in financial markets that the Fed is buckling to
election-year pressures by the administration to abandon its
inflation battle.
   Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said Greenspan's comments should help to ease
market anxieties.
   ``It took away from any negatives he created when he seemed to
be wavering'' last week, Platt said.
   Those fears were raised when Greenspan said the Fed stood ready
to lower interest rates to support a credible deficit reduction
package if such assistance was needed to keep the country out of a
recession.
   At a hearing Tuesday by the House Banking subcommittee on
domestic monetary policy, Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., told Greenspan
that he believed Monday's steep drop in the stock market was caused
by general worries that the Fed was wavering in its
inflation-fighting resolve.
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 56.44 points on
Monday, after a topsy-turvy day that saw the indicator down by more
than 100 points in early trading. On Tuesday, stocks rebounded with
the Dow industrials finishing up by 17.82 points.
   In his testimony, Greenspan repeated his support for legislation
sponsored by Neal that would commit the Fed to pursuing policies to
achieve ``zero inflation.'' He said he believed such a goal was
within reach because of policies over the past three years that
have slowed the growth of the nation's money supply.
   The Fed's goal is to provide enough money to the banking system
to keep the economy growing while guarding against supplying so
much that it results in renewed inflation. Over the past three
years, the money supply has grown at a slow pace not seen in three
decades, Greenspan said.
   ``If we don't fritter away the benefits of the last 2{ to three
years, and I can assure you we don't intend to do that, then I see
no reason to expect other than the achievement of general price
stability over the next several years,'' Greenspan told Neal.
   Greenspan said the actual response of the Fed to any
deficit-cutting agreement would depend very much on how financial
markets viewed the package.
   He predicted that a ``credible and enforceable'' budget deficit
agreement would spark a significant drop in interest rates on
financial markets. And he said the Fed would not act to accelerate
the move to lower rates unless such action could be taken without
risking the central bank's overriding goal of reducing inflation.
   Greenspan testified that the recent report showing that consumer
prices jumped 0.5 percent in June had added a ``note of caution''
to the inflation outlook.
   But he said the June increase and other bad inflation figures
reflected past history and not recent gains the Fed has made by
slowing the growth of the money supply.

<TEXT>
   U.S. warships and aircraft are conducting a
joint exercise in the Persian Gulf with forces of the United Arab
Emirates amid rising tensions between Kuwait and Iraq over oil
production and pricing.
   The Pentagon announced Tuesday that six U.S. warships and three
aircraft were participating in a ``short-notice'' exercise with UAE
forces, but the administration gave conflicting signals on the
alert status of the U.S. forces.
   The UAE has been an implicit target of Iraq's recent complaints
that some of its Arab neighbors have been undercutting oil prices
by exceeding their oil-production quotas as established by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Concern for Kuwait's security has grown since Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein last Friday accused his tiny neighbor of stealing
$2.4 billion worth of oil from Iraqi wells and of trying to wreck
the Iraqi economy by conspiring to push down world oil prices.
   Baghdad renewed its verbal assault on Kuwait on Tuesday. The
Iraqi government newspaper Al-Joumhouriya accused Kuwait of
coordinating its moves with the United States to ``clear the way
for foreign powers to intervene in the area.''
   Meanwhile, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III said in
congressional testimony that American ships were put on alert in
the gulf on Monday, but he offered no details.
   Later, Pete Williams, spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, said he could not confirm that the ships were on alert.
Williams told reporters that two U.S. vessels had left early from
their port in Bahrain, midway in the gulf, to join the exercise
with UAE forces. He said that did not mean they were on alert.
   Williams said the exercise, code-named ``Ivory Justice,'' began
Monday. He said it was mainly an air-refueling mission with UAE
aircraft.
   Participating in the exercise were two U.S. Air Force KC-135
refueling tanker planes and one U.S. C-141 cargo plane, plus six
American warships already patrolling in the gulf. The U.S. aircraft
flew to the gulf from an air base in West Germany, Williams said.
   Williams said he could not comment on whether the joint exercise
in the gulf was in response to the Iraq-Kuwait tensions.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
both Iraq and Kuwait had built up their forces and U.S. officials
were ``very concerned.''
   ``Iraq and others know there is no place for coercion in a
civilized world,'' she said. ``All disputes should be handled
through peaceful means.''
   When asked whether the United States would come to Kuwait's
defense if attacked by Iraq, Williams said he could not comment
beyond restating U.S. policy on the gulf.
   ``Our continuing efforts there are not directed against any
single country but are to ensure that we have an adequate
capability, together with our friends, should the need arise,'' he
said.

   When a judge began releasing demonstrators
who had trespassed at the Seabrook nuclear power plant in 1977,
then-Attorney General David Souter jumped into his car, sped to the
court and insisted the protesters be jailed.
   When state workers struck illegally in 1983, then-Superior Court
Judge Souter agreed to a midnight hearing and issued a pre-dawn
ruling threatening stiff fines if the workers didn't end their
sickout.
   When a lawyer stole money from a client, Judge Souter wanted him
to go to jail, not just repay the money.
   Throughout his career as prosecutor and judge in New Hampshire,
Souter, 50, has taken his role seriously and dealt firmly with
those who didn't hold the law in as high a regard as he.
   The opinions he authored as a state Supreme Court justice reveal
a writer who sticks to the facts and avoids rhetorical flourishes.
There are no broad pronouncements on issues such as abortion or
affirmative action that he certainly would confront if he wins
confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Souter was attorney general when the state police arrested 1,414
demonstrators who defied authorities, marched onto the Seabrook
nuclear plant construction site and camped overnight.
   The protesters were locked in National Guard armories for two
weeks. When a local judge released a demonstrator on a suspended
sentence and small fine, Souter was incensed.
   ``He played a very significant role,'' said Seabrook foe Robert
Cushing, one of those arrested in the May 1977 protest.
   Cushing said that when Souter found out about the suspended
sentence, ``he left from Concord, drove down to district court, and
argued that there should be a jail sentence imposed.''
   The judge resentenced the demonstrator, Cushing said.
   The State Employees' Association felt Souter's sting during a
sickout in June 1983. At midnight, then-Gov. John Sununu called
Souter and asked him to hold a hearing, which he did. At 3:45 a.m.,
Souter ordered everyone back to work and threatened to fine the
union $5,000 a day and its leadership $500 a day.
   ``He came down heavy,'' said the union director, Denis Parker.
``There's no question about it.''
   Manchester lawyer Jack Middleton remembers a case in which a
lawyer had stolen money from a client. Both sides had decided to
drop the matter if the lawyer repaid the money, he said, but Souter
wouldn't buy it.
   ``That just sounded like a bank transaction to him,'' Middleton
said, and ``he didn't view that as a loan.''
   In addition to showing that Souter was tough, Middleton said the
episode showed that Souter ``was going to take a hard look at the
facts and make up his own mind ... and not just take the word of
the prosecution or the defense lawyer.''
   Souter served seven years on the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
   In a 1988 decision criticized by women's rights groups, Souter
ordered a new trial for a man who was convicted of sexual assault.
The defendant said his lawyers improperly were prevented from
offering evidence the woman publicly flirted with other men on the
day of the alleged attack.
   Souter said such evidence was essential to the man's defense
that the woman had consented to having sex with him.
   Souter often sides with positions advanced by state government
officials, especially in criminal cases. But there have been
notable exceptions.
   In 1988, Souter led the state court in declaring
unconstitutional a state law that barred a non-profit group from
providing legal services to some disabled people.
   As state attorney general, it fell to Souter to defend the
state's prosecution of a couple who, for religious purposes, taped
over the ``Live Free or Die'' motto on their automobile license.
The Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution violated the couple's
religious freedom.
   As a judge, Souter participated in just one known case dealing
with abortion, siding with the majority in a 1986 ruling that said
physicians have a responsibility to test unborn children for birth
defects and in the event defects are detected to counsel the
pregnant woman about options _ including abortion.

   David H. Souter, the reserved New Hampshire
judge picked by President Bush for the Supreme Court, is armed with
White House advice as he sets out to press the flesh with the
politicians who are key to his confirmation.
   Souter was attending get-acquainted meeting with Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and Republican members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee this afternoon.
   The committee will conduct Souter's confirmation hearing,
expected to begin in September. The president said he hopes the
full Senate will confirm Souter before the high court's next term
begins Oct. 1.
   Souter was paying a similar courtesy call on Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and possibly other Democrats later
in the day.
   Fred McClure, the White House's liaison with Congress, and Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., an old friend, are Souter's guides at the
Capitol. And the nominee has been told by Bush aides to expect a
strong spotlight to be shined on his personal and professional life.
   Souter, appearing more relaxed than he did when his intended
nomination was announced by Bush on Monday, told reporters Tuesday
he was getting used to his new celebrity.
   ``The blood is circulating a little bit better than it was
yesterday afternoon at five o'clock,'' he said. ``I didn't think it
was going to happen. I was astonished.''
   Many senators and special interest groups were surprised as
well, and the divisive rhetoric that immediately accompanied
President Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork in 1987 has not
resurfaced.
   Bush lavished praise on Souter at fund-raising events Tuesday in
Philadelphia and New York.
   ``I look forward to the Senate hearings of David Souter; I am
sure they will find him to be tough but fair,'' the president said.
``He's a first-rate appellate judge, an outstanding jurist and a
great legal mind.''
   ``In my nomination of Judge David Souter for Senate confirmation
... there was no single issue, no litmus test or standard
dominating my decision,'' Bush said. ``And I will add there should
be no litmus test in the process of confirmation.''
   Conservative and liberal activists alike were taking a
wait-and-see attitude, acknowledging that the president's swift
action in choosing Souter had caught them a little off guard.
   Little is known about Souter's views on the vexing social issues
_ abortion, civil rights and church-state relations _ he would
confront if confirmed to replace Justice William J. Brennan, who
retired Friday because of poor health.
   The Union Leader in Manchester, N.H., reported today that in a
1976 college commencement speech, Souter, then state attorney
general, attacked rigid federal affirmative action guidelines as
``affirmative discrimination'' and added, ``There are some things
government cannot do.''
   Souter is ``clearly not like Bork,'' said Elliot Mincberg of
People for the American Way, a liberal group. ``He doesn't have
much of a track record.''
   The United Conservatives of America gave Souter ``a cautious
thumbs-up.'' Richard A. Viguerie, the group's chairman, said,
``Most conservatives today have nervous smiles.''
   Souter brushed aside reporters' questions Tuesday about his
views on abortion, one of the sure focal points of the confirmation
hearings.
   Several senators said it would be inappropriate for the
Judiciary Committee to obtain from Souter his opinion on specific
issues before the court, but one committee member _ Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass. _ suggested that general topics could be broached.
   ``I think there is a desire to have full and complete hearings _
fair,'' Kennedy said.
   Souter spent several hours Tuesday in the White House, where
presidential aides told him that his personal and professional life
would come under exceedingly close scrutiny.
   One participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Souter listened to the advice and indicated there was nothing in
his past to cause him discomfort.
   It appears that in 22 years of public service, Souter has rarely
given a speech or written a law review article, and never publicly
criticized a Supreme Court ruling.
   The only paper trail on him comes from his seven years on the
New Hampshire Supreme Court, and it indicates he is a clear,
dispassionate writer of legal opinions.
   A review of many of the nearly 200 opinions Souter authored
reveals he is most assuredly a judicial conservative _ a judge who
believes in sticking to the case at hand and shies away from making
sweeping statements about the law.
   He often sides with positions advanced by state government
officials, especially in criminal cases. But there have been
notable exceptions.
   In a 1988 decision, Souter led the state court in declaring
unconstitutional a state law that barred a non-profit group from
providing legal services to some disabled people.

   A fired KGB official who's been waging a public
relations campaign against his former employer is being
investigated by government prosecutors looking for evidence he
illegally leaked official secrets.
   The government is investigating former counterintelligence chief
Oleg D. Kalugin under a law against divulging classified
information, the government newspaper Izvestia reported Tuesday.
   Kalugin, who worked as an operative in the United States from
1958 to 1970, in recent weeks has in recent weeks been speaking out
against the KGB at demonstrations and in interviews with Western
and Soviet reporters.
   He has said the KGB still taps telephones, infiltrates Soviet
life, including the Russian Orthodox church and labor organizations
and engages in dirty tricks.
   In a recent article, he said about 20 agents who have defected
to the West in the past decade have caused the ``total collapse''
of many of Soviet spy rings.
   Izvestia did not indicate which of Kalugin's remarks constitute
state secrets.
   ``In June and July 1990,'' the newspaper wrote, ``mass media in
the Soviet Union and other countries disseminated confidential
information, constituting state secrets, citing former
major-general Oleg Kalugin of the state security force or on his
behalf.''
   Izvestia said the prosecutor's office began criminal proceedings
July 17. It did not explain why the action was not reported for a
week.
   Kalugin has embraced the reform policies of the radical
Democratic Platform, alleging his superiors drummed him out of the
agency because of his politics.
   Since he began speaking out, he has been dismissed from the KGB
and stripped of his rank as major general. KGB chief Vladimir A.
Kryuchkov has criticized Kalugin, who was nominated as a candidate
to the Russian republic's parliament from Krasnodar.
   In a newspaper article earlier this month, Kalugin denied
allegations by his former superiors that he himself was responsible
for leaks of information.
   ``Since 1960 until 1980, three KGB agents defected to the
West,'' Kalugin wrote in Komsomolskaya Pravda. ``And since 1980,
about 20 have already betrayed the motherland.
   ``Thus we can boldly speak not of an information leak but about
a majority of Soviet intelligence's secrets sold to the West, about
the total collapse of a great number of intelligence networks,'' he
added.

<TEXT>
   In a surprise attack on a small jungle
village, Shining Path rebels killed at least 40 poorly armed
peasant militiamen and wounded about 10, authorities say.
   A band of more than 50 rebels swept into the town of Vista
Alegre early Tuesday and overwhelmed the militiamen, a spokesman
for the government of Junin province said by telephone from the
provincial capital of Huancaya.
   Vista Alegre is located near Satipo, a jungle city 160 miles
northeast of Lima. Huancayo is 120 miles east of Lima.
   There were no reports of rebel casualties, the spokesman said.
   The Maoist-inspired rebels were armed with assault rifles and
machine guns, while the peasant militiamen were armed with
carbines, machetes, arrows and spears, the spokesman said.
   The army has established hundreds of peasant militia groups to
allow isolated villages and towns to defend themselves from rebel
attacks.
   The number of people killed in rebel violence has increased
since the militia program began.
   The government says at least 19,000 people have been killed in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago.

<TEXT>
   Fears linger over the slaying a year
ago of a 9-year-old girl stabbed 34 times by a mental patient at a
street fair, but city officials say this year's festival Friday
will be safe.
   ``I'll be looking around and I'll probably be holding on to my
kids very tightly, not that I think it would have made any
difference last year,'' Cindy Morehouse said as she strolled
downtown Tuesday with her two young sons.
   Jessica Short's mother and several other people watched
helplessly as the girl was killed on July 28 by David Peterson, a
patient at Connecticut Valley Hospital.
   Peterson left the minimum-security state mental hospital without
permission, took a bus three miles to downtown, bought a hunting
knife and pounced on Jessica as she walked out of a Woolworth's
store.
   Horrified witnesses and police pulled him off the girl in less
than a minute, after she was stabbed 34 times.
   George Russell, manager of the Woolworth's store and a witness
to the attack, said the slaying sharply curtailed business for
months. Now, business has rebounded, but Russell said the attack
took a personal toll.
   ``I still relive the incident. Time is not a factor. I have a
picture in my head and I still get flashbacks. It's hard to deal
with,'' he said.
   Officials in this city of 45,000 held a news conference Tuesday
to assure that the annual one-day festival will be safe.
   ``Middletown can't blame itself as a city for what happened.
Things like this could have happened anywhere,'' said Mike Blais,
the festival chairman.
   As a measure of security, a mobile crisis team of Connecticut
Valley workers will attend the festival, Mayor Paul Gionfriddo
said. But he predicted the fair will be as uneventful as this
year's Memorial Day parade and July 4 celebration.
   A booth will be set up at the festival to raise funds for two
charities established in Jessica's name.
   Peterson, 37 when Jessica was stabbed, is a chronic paranoid
schizophrenic with a history of mental illness and violence. He has
spent more than 15 years in mental institutions. In 1971 and 1988,
he was found innocent by reason of insanity in stabbing attacks.
   In March, he also was found innocent by reason of insanity in
Jessica's slaying and ordered confined for 70 years and placed in
Connecticut's only maximum-security psychiatric hospital, Whiting
Forensic Institute in Middletown.
   At Peterson's arraignment, an angry crowd yelled, ``Kill him,
kill him.''
   Some Middletown residents are afraid other David Petersons are
waiting to strike. Connecticut Valley patients with passes make
regular trips downtown from the 468-bed hospital, and ex-patients
live in halfway houses in the area.
   Many customers call The Baby's Shoppe on Main Street before
coming to the store so they can be met at their cars, said Laurel
Rosner, a co-owner. She accompanies customers to their cars when
they leave.
   Even merchants who say the effect of the stabbing on the
community psyche has been overblown acknowledge it is still on the
minds of many.
   ``Occasionally we'll still hear, `Is it OK to bring my daughter
downtown?' '' said Vincent Amato, who owns a toy and hobby shop.
   Gionfriddo said Connecticut Valley has tightened restrictions
since the stabbing. The hospital can't take day passes away from
patients entitled to them, but it plans its own activities Friday
to encourage patients with passes to remain on hospital grounds,
Gionfriddo said.
   Jessica's father, Ronald Short, may attend the festival, but her
mother, Catherine, will not.
   ``This is a very difficult time for me emotionally,'' she said.
``I don't feel there is any need for me to go.''

<HEAD>House Panel Votes 5 Percent Budget Increase for Arts Endowment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $180 million budget approved for the
National Endowment for the Arts by a House Appropriations
subcommittee includes a $900,000 increase in federal funds for
state arts agencies.
   The bill was sent to the full House Appropriations Committee by
voice vote Tuesday without action on any anti-obscenity amendments
that would restrict the kinds of art eligible for tax-paid
endowment grants.
   Debate on separate legislation to extend the NEA's life for five
years has been postponed until after the August recess because of
the large number of amendments to be considered.
   Republicans are drafting proposals for a drastic overhaul of the
endowment as a result of past financial support for art that some
have denounced as obscene or sacrilegious.
   The appropriations bill approved by the subcommittee Tuesday
would provide a 5 percent increase in the NEA budget, from $171.3
million to $180 million in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   At the urging of Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the subcommittee
chairman and a staunch arts advocate, the panel approved boosting
endowment funds for states arts councils from $26.1 million to $27
million.

<HEAD>No Increase in Disciplinary Action Against Physicians in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group says the same number of
physicians were disciplined by state medical boards in 1988 as the
year before, reversing a trend toward more sanctions.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group said Tuesday it arrived at
the number of 1,489 from an analysis of the most recent data
compiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards.
   It counted license revocations or suspensions and probations.
   In 1984, serious actions were taken against 745 physicians,
Public Citizen said. That increased to 1,089 in 1985 and 1,277 in
1986.
   The group said none of the rates were high enough.
   ``A physician could still operate drunk, commit a gross act of
negligence, or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slap
on the wrist from his or her state's medical board in most
states,'' the group said.

   The Postal Service may limit the number of
packages it accept at one time to avoid being overloaded in case
there is a strike at rival United Parcel Service.
   ``If there is a (work) stoppage next week there is no way (the
Postal Service) can absorb the operations of UPS overnight into our
system,'' Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin said
Tuesday.
   However, he said any restrictions would affect only to volume
shippers. Individuals sending four or fewer parcels at one time
would not be impacted.
   Individuals or organizations needing to send five or more
packages will be required to contact the postal service by
telephone to make a reservation to bring their parcels to a postal
handling center in the region of the intended delivery, he said.
   For example, if a company in Chicago wanted to send truck loads
of parcels to customers in Atlanta, it would make a reservation to
deliver the parcels to the postal facility in Atlanta. The company
sending the packages would be responsible for getting them from
Chicago to Atlanta, and the Postal Service would then complete the
delivery to homes.

<HEAD>Discovery Called Important Step for Alzheimer's Victims</HEAD>

   The discovery of a genetic defect that
may cause most cases of Alzheimer's disease could someday lead to a
treatment, researchers say.
   ``We're anxiously following this, and if it's true it would be
quite significant,'' said Creighton Phelps, vice president of
medical and scientific affairs at the National Alzheimer's
Association in Chicago.
   On Tuesday, Dr. Allen Roses of the Duke University medical
school in Durham, N.C., said he found a genetic abnormality that
may cause the most common form of Alzheimer's disease, which
afflicts about 4 million Americans.
   The finding surprised most researchers studying the disease's
genetics. They have been busily investigating a different
abnormality.
   ``We're betting the output of our laboratory'' that the new
abnormality is the cause of all but a rare form of Alzheimer's,
Roses said.
   In a presentation at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Roses
said that based on his study of 32 families in which Alzheimer's is
prevalent, the disease appears to be linked to an abnormality on
chromosome 19, one of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes.
   Previous studies found a defect on chromosome 21 linked to an
early-onset form of Alzheimer's in which memory loss and other
symptoms begin to appear around age 40. That form of the disease
has been found in only 10 or 20 families in the world, Roses said.
   It could turn out that the early-onset form of Alzheimer's is a
different disease. Roses used his genetic samples to search for a
defect on chromosome 21 in late-onset Alzheimer's disease and
couldn't find it.
   The idea that chromosome 21 is linked to the disease was so
powerful that Roses said he has had difficulty persuading others
that chromosome 21 may not be the culprit in most cases. He said he
has been frustrated in efforts to publish his findings in a
scientific journal.
   Other researchers are now rapidly trying to determine whether
their genetic samples from Alzheimer's victims also reveal an
abnormality on chromosome 19, said Dr. Peter St. George-Hyslop of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He is one of the
discoverers of the defect on chromosome 21.
   ``The follow-up studies need to be done,'' St. George-Hyslop
said. ``This area of genetics of late-onset neurological disease is
extremely difficult to do.''
   Finding the genetic defect is a crucial first step toward
figuring out precisely what goes wrong in Alzheimer's disease and
perhaps how to fix it. No cause or cure is known for the
progressive neurological disorder.
   One of the problems with doing research on Alzheimer's is that
the disease normally appears in people in their 60s, 70s or 80s.
Many people who carry a genetic predisposition for the disease die
of something else before they develop it, Roses said.
   ``There are a lot of people in the field who have doubts about
whether late-onset Alzheimer's can even be approached by genetic
techniques,'' Roses said.
   Researchers differ in their view of the disease. Roses believes
that virtually all people would develop Alzheimer's if they lived
long enough. Some people merely have an abnormality that makes the
disease show up in their 60s; others might not get it unless they
lived to be 120, he said.
   In fact, the condition normally thought of as senility in very
old people is indistinguishable from Alzheimer's, Roses said.
   The genetic research could ultimately lead to a way to delay the
appearance of the disease, if not cure it outright, Roses said.
   ``If we can delay it from the age of 80 to 105, I think people
would be satisfied,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Van Gogh Suffered Maddening Ear Infection, Not Madness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vincent van Gogh cut off his ear and later killed
himself because of a painful but undiagnosed inner-ear infection,
not madness, a report published today suggests.
   The artist, who committed suicide 100 years ago Sunday at age
37, suffered from Meniere's disease, an often misdiagnosed
infection, Dr. I. Kaufman Arenberg said in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The disease, which afflicts about 7 million Americans, is
brought on by excess fluid and pressure in the ear and can cause
severe bouts of vertigo and hallucinations.
   Van Gogh, who sold just one painting during his life but whose
work now commands record prices, described those symptoms in
letters to family members, Arenberg and colleagues reported.
   ``His voluminous correspondence should forever banish the notion
that he was an epileptic or `mad,''' their report said.
   Other symptoms include vomiting, painful pressure and persistent
noise in the ear, along with possible hearing loss. Attacks may
last from several hours to several days and are often marked by
long periods of no symptoms, conditions described by van Gogh.
   ``The tragedy is that this disease was discovered about 30 years
before van Gogh's death but (information about it) was slow to
disseminate,'' Arenberg said.
   It is unlikely van Gogh's doctors knew of Meniere's disease,
named after the French doctor who identified it in 1861, Arenberg
said. He added that no treatment for the malady was available at
the time.
   Researchers have guessed for decades about van Gogh's mental
problems. One doctor theorized that van Gogh had a personality
disorder stemming from epilepsy. Another scientist suggested he was
addicted to absinthe.
   Arenberg and colleagues at the Swedish Medical Center in
Englewood, Colo., studied 796 letters that van Gogh wrote to family
and friends from 1884 to 1890, and those of the doctor who treated
the artist.
   After years of deterioriating health, the Dutch-born artist
checked into a mental asylum in France, where a Dr. Peyron wrote:
``It is my opinion that Mr. van Gogh is subject to epileptic fits
at very infrequent intervals.''
   In a letter dated Sept. 10, 1889 to his brother, Theo, the
artist recounted his gloomy prognosis.
   ``I must say that M. Peyron does not give me much hope for the
future and I think this right, he makes me realize that everything
is doubtful that one can be sure of nothing beforehand,'' he wrote.
   Peyron wrote that van Gogh probably cut off his left ear in a
fit of madness or instability in December 1888. But Arenberg said
the artist might have done so as a crude way of relieving the pain
or intense buzzing or ringing.
   Doctors now treat Meniere's disease with drugs, by removing the
inner ear or by shunting blocked fluids from the area under
pressure, Arenberg said. Treatment is effective in about 80 percent
of all patients.
   ``The biggest impact the disease had on him was fear,'' Arenberg
said. ``He had a tremendous fear that (epilepsy) would come and
leave him incapacitated from painting permanently. That's probably
why he painted so much in the years before his death.''
   Van Gogh's work is among the most prized in the art world. In
May, his ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' drew the highest price ever
paid at auction for a painting _ $82.5 million.

   John Mellencamp's sleepy hometown has
become the site for his first movie.
   Most of the work on ``Souvenirs'' is being done after midnight
so production doesn't interfere with merchants and residents, Cindy
Livinghouse, deputy director of the Indiana Tourism and Film
Development Commission, said Tuesday.
   Filming began Monday in this southern Indiana town of 13,600 and
was expected to last about seven weeks, said Harry Sandler, the
singer's manager.
   Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins appear in the film with
Mellencamp. Few details about the movie have been released, which
is how Mellencamp wants it, Sandler said.
   Mellencamp, known for his Midwestern rock and work in organizing
Farm Aid concerts, was born and raised in Seymour and lives near
Bloomington.

<HEAD>Archeologists in Israel Find `Golden Calf'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archeologists in Israel have discovered an
ancient ``golden calf'' figurine, a pagan idol frequently mentioned
in the Bible, it was reported today.
   The hand-sized, mixed-metal figurine, about 3,500 years old, is
the first of its kind to be unearthed, The New York Times reported.
   Harvard University archeologists excavating Canaanite ruins near
the ancient port city of Ashkelon found the figurine on June 26,
the Times said.
   The earliest legends of Judaism feature warnings against
worshiping golden calves, revered by Canaanites because their gods
were believed to ride the sacred beasts.
   ``It was a totally unexpected find,'' said Lawrence E. Stager,
the Harvard professor who heads the Israeli dig. ``We were just
cleaning down the side of the stone ramparts, and the last thing we
thought we would find was this temple. We haven't found any
precedents for this.''
   The figurine was found in the rubble of a temple destroyed by
Egyptian conquerers in about 1550 B.C., during the Bronze Age. The
figurine dates from midway through the second millennium B.C.,
Stager said.
   The calf is about 4\ inches tall and 4{ inches long and weighs
just less than 1 pound. It was cast in parts and pieced together.
   The body is made of bronze and markings show it likely was
burnished to look golden. The legs, head and genitals are made of
an as-yet untested metal that appears to be silver. One surviving
horn and the tail were made from copper wire and the figure is
filled with a heavy metal, believed to be lead.
   It was found near a small pottery shrine that had an opening
with doors.
   ``We believe it was displayed looking out, emerging from this
cowshed, which was a shrine to the milk goddess,'' Stager said.
   The largely intact figurine suffered mild corrosion, giving the
bronze and copper pieces a green tint and making the silver look
gray.
   In the Bible, golden calves are mentioned in the story of Aaron,
the Exodus, tales of ancient Jerusalem's rivalry with the
calf-worshiping Hebrew king Jeroboam, and in other Old Testament
accounts.
   The find is expected to help scientists study religious
developments in the region that gave birth to Judaism, Christianity
and Islam. When testing and research is completed, the calf likely
will be turned over to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
   Ashkelon, one of the largest cities in the region during its
heyday, was about 2,000 years old when Egypt invaded and had a
population of 15,000 to 20,000 people. The dig site is located
about 30 miles south of Tel Aviv.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo; Stocks Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were almost
unchanged.
   The dollar closed at 149.13 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 148.70 yen. It opened at 148.98 yen and ranged between
148.89 yen and 149.32 yen.
   The dollar has gained 1.88 yen in five trading days after it
shed 0.95 yen to a 147.25-yen close on Friday.
   Trading was active, with spot transactions totaling $11.130
billion, up from Tuesday's $8.833 billion.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost a marginal
1.19 points, or 0.004 percent, closing at 31,701.27. The index had
shed 192.33 points on Tuesday.
   The widely watched index has lost 1,354.35 points in four
trading days.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a meager 350
million shares, down from Tuesday's 355 million shares.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 86.00 points as of 4:00 p.m., up from Tuesday's close of
85.84 points. The yield was 7.415 percent, down from 7.450 percent.
   Currency dealers said tension between Kuwait and Iraq and
moderate recovery of the New York stock prices prompted dollar
buying.
   Kouhei Kuroda of Fuji Bank said there was a strong demand for
the dollar, but selling resistance limited the dollar's ascent.
   The dollar usually is bought in Tokyo as a safe haven in times
of international tension.
   On the stock market, share prices softened after opening higher
following the recovery on Wall Street.
   ``A lingering uncertain outlook for (Japan's) interest rates was
the main factor,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa
Securities.
   Japan's long-term credit banks are considering raising the
long-term prime rate by 0.3 percent to 7.9 percent later this week,
according to bank officials.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's stock market less
attractive to investors.

   Bursting into a Hindu temple during
evening prayers, Sikh militants opened fire with automatic rifles,
killing five worshipers and wounding at least 14, police said today.
   At least 40 people were in the temple and its gates were
unguarded when the attack occurred Tuesday in the Punjab town of
Bhatinda, said police Superintendent Rajinder Singh.
   Four militants entered the building, spread out and fired at the
congregation, then escaped, he said.
   Also Tuesday, a Sikh couple and their two children were killed
in their sleep when militants broke into their home and shot them,
police said.
   At least three militants were involved in the attack on the
outskirts of Amritsar, the Sikh holy city, Superintendent Sanjiv
Gupta said.
   The United News of India news agency reported at least four
other killings by Sikh extremists in other parts of the state on
Tuesday.
   Sikh militants have mainly targeted Hindus in their 8-year quest
for an independent nation in the Sikh-majority state of Punjab. But
they have also killed moderate Sikhs whom they accuse of being
police informers.
   Sikhs, easily identifiable by their long hair, colorful turbans
and untrimmed beards, make up only 2 percent of India's 880 million
population but comprise 55 percent of Punjab's 17.6 million people.
   They accuse the Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of the country's
people, of discriminating against Sikhs in language and and job
opportunities.
   Tuesday's deaths raise to 1,485 the number of people killed by
militants in Punjab this year. Most of the deaths have occurred in
the district of Amritsar, the center of the insurgency.
   Bhatinda, in the heart of the state's cotton belt, is 110 miles
south of Amritsar.

   A Canadian import won the latest ratings
battle among U.S. networks.
   Part two of the four-hour Canadian Broadcasting Co. docudrama
``Love &amp; Hate: A Marriage Made in Hell,'' broadcast on NBC, was the
No. 1 program on American television for the week ending July 21,
the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday.
   Part one of ``Love &amp; Hate,'' a Canadian Broadcasting Co.
production starring Kenneth Welsh and Kate Nelligan, ranked sixth
in the Nielsens a week ago.
   The program was Canada's top-rated mini-series last year. It was
pitched to NBC programming guru Brandon Tartikoff by producer Ivan
Fecan, a former NBC employee who now is Tartikoff's counterpart at
CBC.
   NBC also scored in the latest Nielsens with the debut of ``Real
Life with Jane Pauley,'' on Tuesday at 10 p.m. The magazine-style
show starring the former `Today'' co-host tied for fifth place with
a repeat of NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
   NBC won the overall ratings with a 10.2 average, followed by CBS
with 8.7 and ABC with 8.4. Each ratings point represents 921,000
households.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Love &amp;
Hate: A Marriage Made in Hell,'' Part 2, NBC, 16.3; a ``Cheers''
rerun, NBC, 15.5; a ``Roseanne'' rerun ABC, 13.8; the ``20-20''
prime-time news show, ABC, 13.4; ``Empty Nest'' and ``Real Life
with Jane Pauley,'' (tie) NBC, 13.3; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC, 13.0;
``The Simpsons,'' Fox, 13.0; ``Married...With Children,'' Fox,
(tie) 13.0; ``Miss Teen USA'' pageant, CBS, 12.8.
   The network news battle was won again by ABC with an 8.9
average. CBS was second with an 8 and NBC finished last with 7.4.

   Government troops have captured two
towns just south of the rebel-held Jaffna peninsula, opening a
major road into the Tamil militants' stronghold, military officials
said today.
   At least 96 of the separatist rebels and 13 soldiers were killed
in the three-day operation that gave the government control over
Paranthan and Kilinochchi by dusk Tuesday, said the officials.
   Kilinochchi, 3 miles south of Paranthan, is linked by a national
highway to the town of Jaffna, headquarters of the rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   The government troops also control the highway north of
Paranthan up to the town of Elephant Pass, located just inside the
peninsula, officials said.
   Government paratroopers took Paranthan on Monday after fierce
fighting. The troops then moved to Kilinochchi, establishing
control of the highway, said the officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   ``Having secured Paranthan, troops established a link between
Kilinochchi, Paranthan and Elephant Pass,'' said a senior military
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The report could not be independently confirmed and there was no
immediate comment from the rebels.
   Elephant Pass is 30 miles southeast of Jaffna and 185 miles
north of the capital, Colombo. It is at the northern end of the
Elephant Pass causeway across the Jaffna lagoon, which links the
mainland with the peninsula.
   The rebels blew up the causeway last week, but military
officials said it was repaired over the weekend. The causeway is
the only viable route for large-scale crossing onto the peninsula,
which hangs like a scorpion's tail from the northern end of the
island.
   Elephant Pass has been under the tenuous control of government
troops since fighting started June 11. The rebels now are pushed
north of the town.
   The rebels control most of the peninsula and some pockets in the
east.
   About 2,900 combatants have been killed in the fighting in the
two predominantly-Tamil districts, where the rebels seek to
establish a separate homeland.
   On Tuesday, the militants raided a small Sinhalese colony in the
northeastern district of Polonnaruwa and killed eight Sinhalese as
they slept, military officials said. The victims, four men, two
women and two children, were hacked and shot, they said.
   Also Tuesday, the rebels raided a mosque and killed two Moslems
in the eastern town of Sammanturai, accusing them of being military
informers, said the officials.
   Tamil militants have been fighting for an independent homeland
since 1983, saying they are victims of discrimination in jobs and
education by the majority Sinhalese.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
Sinhalese, who control the government and the military, comprise 75
percent.
   The latest round of fighting ended a 13-month cease-fire called
by both sides in May 1989 to help push peace talks. At least 13,900
people have been killed in the 7-year-old Tamil insurrection.

   A NASA researcher analyzing 30,000 images
taken a decade ago by the Voyager II space probe discovered a
hidden moon in Saturn's outermost ring.
   ``It was actually in the first image I looked at,'' said Mark
Showalter, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain
View. ``It was exactly where I expected it to be.''
   Showalter on July 2 found a bright, 12-mile-diameter orb
undetected by Earth-based telescopes.
   ``I remember I was so excited I worked through July Fourth,'' he
said Tuesday after the space agency announced the discovery of
Saturn's 18th moon.
   In 1986, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
researchers first theorized a moon was hidden within what is known
as the Encke's gap around Saturn, but Showalter said he wasn't able
to search for it until recently.
   ``The honest truth is we just didn't work on this for a few
years,'' Showalter said. ``When you drop a research project, it's
very hard to pick it back up.''
   His find confirmed what scientists had believed for several
years _ that undiscovered moons could be hidden among Saturn's
three major icy rings, making them undulate and causing gaps in
several minor rings.
   ``Theory has predicted this new moon for years,'' said David
Morrison, chief of Ames' space science division. ``It's very
gratifying to find that the theory was correct. It's almost a
textbook example of the scientific process.''
   Showalter, 32, found the moon by using a computer program he
designed to sort through the 30,000 Saturn images sent back to
Earth by Voyager in 1980 and 1981.
   The moon, Saturn's smallest, orbits in Encke's gap within the
planet's outermost major ring.
   Showalter and Ames' planetary ring expert Jeff Cuzzi theorized
that a small moon was creating a 200-mile wide gap with its orbit
and was leaving a ``moonlet wake'' pattern similar to boat wakes.
The computer program was based on that hypothesis.
   ``The trick was writing the computer program to tell me which
images to look at,'' Showalter said. ``After that it was actually a
day's work to find it.''
   During the next several days he found 11 images of the moon.
   Pete Waller, manager of public information for NASA, said the
moon is orbiting about 73,600 kilometers from Saturn's cloud tops
and weighs about 1 trillion tons. It's tentatively known as 1981S13.
   The discovery was reported last week in a publication by the

   Showalter has suggested Pan, the Greek god of shepherds, because
the moon creates a so-called ``shepherding effect'' by pushing
material away from its orbit to cause the ring gap.
   Showalter said he doesn't expect any more hidden moons to be
found within that gap, but scientists have theorized that
undiscovered moons might be spotted in another major gap around
Saturn known as the Cassini Division.

<HEAD>Patients Face Minimal Risk of Getting AIDS From Surgeons, Study
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians with AIDS are unlikely to transmit the
deadly virus to patients during surgery, according to a study of
2,160 people operated on by a Tennessee doctor who had the disease.
   None of the patients whom Dr. Harold Dennison operated on
between 1982 and his 1989 death are believed to have contracted
AIDS during surgery, a report in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association said.
   Only one patient, an intravenous drug user who frequented
prostitutes, tested positive for the AIDS virus. But the authors
concluded that the patient had contracted AIDS through his
high-risk activities and not from surgical contact with Dennison,
who removed a lymph node from the man in 1984.
   ``The results of this investigation support the concept that
risks to patients operated on by (surgeons infected with the AIDS
virus) are most likely quite low,'' wrote the authors, led by Dr.
Ban Mishu of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Frank Rhame, a University of
Minnesota AIDS expert, estimates that hundreds of AIDS-infected
surgeons are practicing in the United States.
   The CDC has no figures on the number of U.S. surgeons and
physicians infected with AIDS, said spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd.
   But of the 139,765 AIDS cases reported in the United States
since 1981, more than 5,000 involved health-care workers, including
doctors, nurses, lab technicians and other medical workers, she
said.
   But Rhame said there are no known surgeon-to-patient
transmissions of the disease. He estimated the risk of patients
being infected by their surgeons at between one in 100,000 and one
in 1 million operations.
   Dennison, 56, died Jan. 30, 1989, just weeks after he tested
positive for AIDS. Dennison believed he contracted AIDS while
operating on a patient with the disease, but he didn't know when he
had been infected, co-author Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt
University's School of Medicine said in a telephone interview
Tuesday.
   It was estimated that Dennison had been infected no earlier than
1982, so with the help from Baptist Hospital, HCA West Side
Hospital and HCA Park View Hospital _ the Nashville facilities
where he worked _ the authors learned the names and addresses of
the 2,160 patients he had operated on since then.
   None of them had been reported to Tennessee's AIDS registry, and
264 had died. None of the deaths were AIDS-related.
   The authors mailed letters to the 1,896 remaining patients,
seeking to have them tested for AIDS. Letters to 244 patients were
returned marked ``address unknown.''
   Of the 1,652 who were contacted, 615 were tested for AIDS.
   Although 1,037 patients chose not to submit to tests, those who
were tested had undergone the most invasive operations or had been
operated on most recently _ when Dennison was the most contagious _
and thus faced the greatest risk of contracting the virus,
Schaffner said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cripples victims'
ability to fight infections. It is passed through blood and other
body fluids.

   Rebels fighting the Soviet-backed
Afghan government reacted angrily today to a U.S. move to slash
their military aid as part of efforts with Moscow to work out a
cease-fire plan.
   The mujahedeen, or Moslem holy warriors, have been bankrolled by
the United States for more than a decade.
   ``It will damage the good will between the mujahedeen and the
United States, said Suleiman Shah, spokesman for a provisional
rebel government. ``Even now many people in the resistance are
skeptical of the true dependability of the United States.''
   On Tuesday a U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee voted to slash
aid to the mujahedeen, claiming Washington had achieved its purpose
in Afghanistan when Soviet troops withdrew in February 1989, said
Sen. Frank Murkowski, R.-Alaska, a panel member.
   Shah claimed Moscow still funds its Kabul allies to the tune of
about $300 million a month. Washington had been giving the
guerrillas between $300 million and $500 million annually.
   A U.S. congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity
in Washington, said about $100 million would be cut from covert aid
to Afghan rebels in 1991.
   ``The Russians despite economic problems inside the Red empire
and (internal) political upheaval have done nothing to stop aid to
their puppets in Kabul,'' said Shah.
   ``It's true that lots of signs of change have taken place inside
and outside the Russian empire, but nothing has changed in
Afghanistan,'' he said.
   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused to comment on the proposed
cuts. Rebel supporters in Washington are hoping money would be
restored at higher levels before the entire Senate finishes work on
the bill, which includes 1991 money for covert action around the
world.
   Washington and Moscow have been trying to work out a political
end to the 12-year-old war that has claimed more than 1 million
lives.
   Three million Afghans live in squalid refugee camps throughout
Pakistan's rugged border provinces. Two million live in Iran.
   Most fled their homeland after 1979 when the Soviet Union sent
about 115,000 soldiers into Afghanistan to help crush a burgeoning
insurgency and install a friendly communist government in Kabul.
   A U.N.-brokered accord provided for the Soviet troop withdrawal.
The United Nations has been trying to initiate a political
settlement along with the two superpowers, who claim to be close to
an agreement.
   Next week in Irkutsk, Siberia, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze are to
discuss a timetable for Afghan President Najibullah to step down,
said U.S. officials in Washington who spoke on condition of
anonymity Tuesday.
   The stumbling block among the rebels has been Najibullah's role
in a post-war Afghanistan. Washington has agreed Najibullah could
remain as president during elections, but only if he gives up
control of the military, media and state-run secret police.
   Earlier this month Najibullah seemed ready to go along with the
plan, but Western diplomats feared he was not prepared to turn the
power over to a neutral body. There has been no reported progress
on who would assume control of the key ministries during an
election.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``we're just waiting for the Soviets to return with a reply. We've
gone as far as we can go and still get the mujahedeen to sign on.''
   The United States earlier refused to even accept Najibullah's
presence in Kabul before or after elections.
   But Washington revised its bargaining position after guerrilla
fighters, who had been expected to overrun Kabul shortly after the
Soviet troop withdrawal, fought to a stalemate on the battlefield
and were defeated in successive political battles.
   ``The United States doesn't care about the people of
Afghanistan. ... It was just looking for its own benefit in
Afghanistan,'' said Abdul Haidi, a spokesman for the vociferously
anti-Western Hezb-e-Islami (Party of Islam) rebel group, led by
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   Hekmatyar's party has been linked to the narcotics trade, which
some senators cited as part of the rationale for reducing
assistance. Hekmatyar has repeatedly denied the charges.

   Workers at one of Kentucky's largest coal
companies voted overwhelmingly to join the United Mine Workers,
culminating a bitter organizing drive.
   Tuesday's 540-149 vote at South East Coal Co. was ``the largest
victory the United Mine Workers has had, that I'm aware of, in the
last 15 years,'' said Don Barnett, the union's assistant regional
director for the South.
   ``I think this is a direct result of the victory at Pittston,''
Barnett said. The union settled a 10-month strike against Pittston
Coal Group on Feb. 19 when 1,700 workers in Kentucky, West Virginia
and Virginia approved a new contract.
   Miners and union organizers celebrated loudly at a motel in this
small eastern Kentucky town, slapping backs and showering each
other with champagne.
   Officials at South East declined to comment. In a newspaper
advertisement before the vote, the company had warned of ``possible
strikes, work stoppages and violence'' if the union prevailed.
   South East, one of the state's largest coal companies, operates
four underground mines and a large coal processing plant in Irvine.
Last year the company mined 2 million tons of coal.
   Workers were angry the company didn't offer a retirement plan,
had cut health benefits and hadn't raised salaries since 1981. Top
scale for South East's 738 hourly workers is $11.75 per hour; under
the union's 1988 national contract, top pay is $17.38 per hour.
   ``It just proves that everybody was fed up,'' said Greg Horn,
29, a laborer from Whitesburg.
   UMW President Richard Trumka telephoned his congratulations to
the new union members.
   Trumka, who turned 41 Tuesday, called the union vote ``the best
birthday present he could have had,'' Barnett said. The UMW and
other unions nationally have suffered membership losses and
organizing defeats in recent years.

   New York has an official fruit and an

Mario Cuomo can help it.
   Cuomo vetoed a bill Tuesday that would have designated the
collectible container for Empire Spring Mineral Water as the
state's official bottle. He said the naming of official state
objects has gotten out of hand.
   ``We have walked the line a number of times in recent years with
these `memorializations,' '' Cuomo said. ``This bill crosses it.''
   Cuomo also said he didn't want to give a collectible an
advantage in the marketplace. The pint-sized emerald-colored
bottles now fetch $4 or $5 apiece.
   Lawmakers pushing for official designation had hoped to draw
tourists to the National Bottle Museum in Ballston Spa, a
northeastern New York town.
   With the veto, the bottle fails to join other state symbols that
include the official fruit (apple), tree (sugar maple), insect
(lady bug) and muffin (apple).

   The village's board of trustees approved the switch Monday.
Government agencies could move into its 27,500 square feet at the

   A developer that owns the mall will take over the government's

   The mall space will cost the village $1.4 million, or $600,000
above the hall's $800,000 pricetag, Rosenthal said. He said the

<HEAD>Bail for Marlon Brando's Son in Murder Trial Set at $10 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando's son was ordered to stand
trial for murder in the fatal shooting of his half-sister's
boyfriend at the family estate, and bail was set at $10 million.
   The rulings by Muncipal Court Judge Larry Fidler on Tuesday came
after a two-day preliminary hearing in which Christian Brando was
quoted as saying he accidentally killed Dag Drollet, 26, in a fight
over a gun.
   Brando, 32, said a scuffle broke out because the victim was
abusing his pregnant half-sister, Cheyenne Brando.
   ``Death is too good for the guy,'' Brando was quoted as telling
police shortly after the killing at his father's Hollywood Hills
mansion.
   Drollet's body was found on a couch, still holding a cigarette
lighter and a television remote control, and prosecutors say there
was no sign of a struggle.
   The judge decided that Brando should stand trial for murder, not
the lesser charge of manslaughter his lawyer had wanted.
   ``There has been a killing and the defendant pulled the
trigger,'' Fidler said.
   Prosecutors argued that Brando should be held without bail
because his father's fortune could meet any bail amount and allow
him to flee the country.
   ``If the court sets bail in this case, Christian Brando will
make it even if it's $20 million,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Steven Barshop.
   To support his argument, Barshop cited Miss Brando's recent
departure for Tahiti, where she remains. She is not expected to
return for the trial.
   Defense attorney Robert Shapiro said Christian would not jump
bail because he would never betray his father, known for his
starring roles in such films as ``On the Waterfront'' and ``The
Godfather.''
   ``This is a young man who has great and tremendous respect for
his father,'' Shapiro said as the bulky, white-haired actor
listened from a front row courtroom seat. After the judge's
decision, the elder Brando was hurriedly led out a back door of the
courtroom.
   Later, Shapiro said bail would be posted but declined to say
when Brando's release from jail was expected.
   District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the $10 million
bail is likely the highest ever set by a judge in Los Angeles
County.
   Brando also will be tried on a weapons charge for allegedly
possessing a machine gun. If convicted, he could face 25 years to
life in prison. Arraignment in Superior Court arraignment was
scheduled for Aug. 7.
   During arguments, the prosecutor quoted spontaneous comments
Brando made to the first police officer on the scene.
   ``I did it because he hurt my sister. My sister is pregnant. ...
He was laying on the couch. He was fighting with my sister. I said,
`You leave my sister alone,''' the policeman quoted Brando as
saying.
   Later in the statement, Brando conceded that he did not like
Drollet and declared, ``Man, death is too good for the guy.''

<HEAD>Amoco Says It Will Appeal Judge's Order to Pay $155 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. said it will appeal a federal court
order to pay $155 million in damages and interest from a massive
oil spill by the tanker Cadiz off northern France in 1978.
   ``We feel the claims were exaggerated,'' Amoco spokesman Mike
Thompson said Tuesday after the penalty was announced.
   Amoco's decision to appeal the order issued by U.S. District
Judge Charles Norgle promised to prolong the case, a prospect
lamented by plaintiffs.
   ``We, Amoco's victims in Brittany, pray that this great American
company, in its concern for justice and the environment, will
finally pay for the damage that it has caused us,'' said
Jean-Baptiste Henry, spokesman for the local governments and
businesses who sued Amoco.
   ``After 12 years and two judges, we fail to see what Amoco hopes
to gain with an appeal,'' Henry said.
   About 100 French towns have argued the spill adversely affected
their commerce. Amoco was held liable for Europe's largest spill,
which fouled 100 miles of France's coastline.
   Norgle on Tuesday formally endorsed an order he spelled out in
June. That order was based on damage recommendations from former
U.S. District Judge Frank McGarr, appointed the case's special
master after retiring from the bench in January 1988.
   The order was finalized after lawyers for Amoco and the French
parties suing the Chicago-based company agreed upon interest
payments on the damages.
   Norgle ordered Amoco to pay about 690 million francs, or about
$120 million split equally in damages and interest, to the French
government, local governments and businesses.
   Amoco also was ordered to pay damages in British pounds to the
Shell oil company, owner of the spilled oil, in the rough
equivalent of $35 million.
   Amoco Tuedsay also said it will sue the ship's builder,
Astilleros Espanoles, S.A., of Spain, to recover damages.
   The Spanish shipbuilder has refused to participate in the U.S.
District Court, contending it lacks jurisdiction. In a statement,
however, it said the court found that Amoco's ``extensive
negligence'' was the cause of the grounding and oil spill.
   The tanker ran aground March 16, 1978, two miles off the
Brittany coast, and spilled 68 million gallons of light fuel oil _
the world's worst spill until a spill in the Gulf of Mexico in
1979. The Exxon Valdez last year spilled nearly 11 million gallons.
   The Amoco Cadiz was under tow through the English Channel when
the towlines snapped in hurricane-force winds and heavy seas,
impaling it on rocks.

   Mohawk Indians locked in an armed impasse
over a plot of land are running low on food and could face criminal
charges. But other Indians from across the nation are rallying to
their support.
   The Assembly of First Nations said Tuesday it was organizing a
``peace and justice caravan'' that is expected in Oka on Sunday.
   Ovide Mercredi, Manitoba regional chief of the Indian assembly,
said as many as 10,000 Indians and non-Indians from across Canada
would take part.
   He said they would try to take food and essential supplies to
the Oka Mohawks but do not plan to challenge police barricades.
   Police have opened several hundred criminal investigations which
could lead to charges from Quebec's justice minister against the
Mohawks, provincial police Constable Andre Blanchette said Tuesday.
   The investigations began after the death of Cpl. Marcel Lemay
during a police assault on the Mohawk barricades at the Kanesatake
reservation near Oka, about 20 miles west of Montreal.
   Two of the investigations concern possible charges of murder and
conspiracy to murder the 31-year-old police officer, though it has
not yet been determined whether he was shot by an Indian or a
fellow officer.
   Other charges include possession of prohibited firearms,
discharging firearms, theft of police vehicles, blocking roads,
threatening to blow up a bridge, firing submachine-guns, evicting
tenants and misdemeanors.
   The reservation, home to 6,000 people, has been closed by police
and Indian blockades since July 11, when police tried to storm the
Mohawk barricade. Provincial police are only letting limited
supplies through.
   The police raid brought to a head a four-month barricade by the
Mohawks, who want to stop expansion of a municipal golf course onto
land in Oka they claim is ancestral Mohawk territory.
   The Mohawks have rejected government demands that they put down
their arms and remove the barricades before negotiations for a
solution take place.
   They want the police to withdraw before they disarm and are
demanding shipments of food, clothing, medical supplies. They also
want observers from either the United Nations or Amnesty
International to be brought in.
   On Tuesday, the Quebec Human Rights Commission called on the
police to respect the provincial Charter of Rights and to allow the
free movement of people, food and medicine into the reservation.
   The commission wants Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa to intervene
personally.
   Spokesman Jacques Lachapelle told a Montreal news conference the
commission is considering suing the police for blocking the flow of
food into the settlement.
   Residents are allowed to cross police lines with one bag of
groceries, and some food is brought in on back roads and across the
Ottawa River. But Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk representative, said
children behind the barricades aren't getting a balanced diet.
   A Red Cross team got through the police blockade on Tuesday and
distributed food and supplies to the Mohawks.
   Linda Gauthier, a Red Cross official, said the agency hopes to
check on the situation every two or three days. She said the Red
Cross distributed enough food for 80 people for three days.
   The Kanasetake Mohawks have drawn support from other Indians
across Canada, including roadblocks in British Columbia and a
blockade by other Mohawks of the Mercier Bridge into Montreal, 18
miles from Oka.
   The Mercier Bridge blockade has forced thousands of people to
find other ways to get into the city from the south shore of
Montreal island.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leader Leaves Church After Scandal, Plans Political
Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a
prominent anti-apartheid campaigner, said today he is resigning his
church posts to seek a political career after a scandal over an
extramarital affair.
   Boesak, saying he wants to play a role in South African
politics, reaffirmed a decision to step down as a Protestant
minister despite pleas from other religious leaders and friends not
to leave the church.
   ``I have ... decided to offer my services to the people of this
country to bring about a united, non-racial and democratic South
Africa. I am prepared to play any role which I may be called upon
to play in this regard,'' he said in a statement released by his
lawyer.
   Church officials had asked Boesak to reconsider when he
announced earlier this month that he was resigning.
   But he said today he could not alter his decision to step down
as a minister of the Sendingkerk Church and as president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches, an international council of
Protestant churches.
   The mixed-race leader also said he would continue his
relationship with television journalist Elna Botha. Press
revelations about Boesak's relationship with Ms. Botha led him to
announce he was resigning.
   Boesak said he and his wife, Dorothy, would divorce. He said he
was not ashamed of his relationship with Ms. Botha and hoped the
press would ignore his private life.
   ``The breakdown of my marriage was a fact long before I met Elna
and what exists between us is a personal matter and nothing which I
can be ashamed of. I have, therefore, no valid reason to
discontinue such contact,'' the statement said.
   Ms. Botha, in a separate statement, said she would continue to
see Boesak. She said her marriage to television journalist Colin
Fluxman had broken down before she began a relationship with Boesak
earlier this year.
   Ms. Botha works for the state-run South African Broadcasting
Corp.
   Boesak has played a major role in the opposition to apartheid,
leading demonstrations and touring the world to denounce South
Africa's racial segregation.
   Boesak, who was long thought to be interested in a political
career, models himself after the late Martin Luther King Jr.
   The revelations about Boesak and Ms. Botha were seen as a moral
scandal in South Africa since both were married and Boesak was an
ordained minister.
   Boesak came under fire in the mid-1980s following news reports
of his involvement with a female church worker. A church inquiry
later cleared him of any wrongdoing.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will try
to clear the last roadblocks to a cease-fire in Afghanistan during
a four-nation trip to Asia that began today.
   U.S. officials said Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze will discuss a timetable for President Najibullah to
step down during their meeting next week in Irkutsk, Soviet Siberia.
   ``The Soviets hinted at a deal; they haven't fleshed it out,''
an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday. ``The thread of the deal is going to be pursued in
Irkutsk by Baker.''
   Members of Congress also have been pushing for a settlement in
the 12-year-old civil war. Earlier this month, members of the
Senate Intelligence Committee voted to cut aid to the Afghan rebels.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a member of the committee, said
he did not attend the meeting where the vote was taken, but the
rationale was that the rebels had achieved their purpose.
   A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he understood the panel reduced funding for the rebels by about
$100 million. Last fall, Congress reportedly appropriated about
$300 million for the rebels.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the intelligence
committee, would not talk about the action on Afghanistan. In the
past, however, he has called for a reassessment of aid to the
rebels.
   A State Department official said Congress appropriates less than
10 percent of what the Soviets give their allies in Afghanistan.
Moscow reportedly spends about $300 million a month to maintain the
Najibullah government.
   For weeks the Bush administration has hoped for a breakthrough
to end the war between Afghan government forces armed by the Soviet
Union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with American-supplied
weapons funneled through Pakistan.
   The administration official disputed a report from Moscow by ABC
News on Tuesday that Shevardnadze and Baker already had cut a deal
to end the civil war. Baker is scheduled to meet Shevardnadze on
Aug. 1.
   The Soviets have not yet conveyed to the United States how
Najibullah might be removed from power in Kabul, said the
administration official.
   The Soviet Union installed the Najibullah government in 1979,
but the government in Kabul has been unable to impose its will on
the countryside. The Soviets withdrew their troops last year but
continued to supply arms.
   The Soviets canceled plans this month to send a delegation to
Washington for talks on when Najibullah should yield power. Both
sides already have reached a tacit agreement that Najibullah would
play no role in the new government and would step down at some
point before his successor take over.
   Administration officials did not criticize Moscow for not
sending the delegation. They said they thought the Kremlin was
simply preoccupied with the 28th Communist Party Congress at the
time.
   On his Asia trip, Baker also will attend a meeting of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Indonesia, and will hold
talks in Singapore and visit Outer Mongolia.

<TEXT>
   A musician's Stradivarius violin, worth about
half a million dollars, was snatched from an airport baggage cart,
police said.
   Erich Gruenberg, 65, was carrying the violin, crafted in 1731,
as he checked through customs after arriving from London at Los
Angeles International Airport on Tuesday afternoon, said city
police Sgt. Dave Nichols.
   The musician reported the violin disappeared from the baggage
cart as he was leaving the airport, Nichols said.
   The instrument was insured for about $500,000. Also stolen were
a violin worth $8,000 and two bows worth $3,500.
   There were no arrests by early today, Nichols said.
   Thefts at the airport are a common occurrence, but the thief may
not have realized what it was he was plucking from the cart,
Nichols said.
   ``If he reads the paper he will, so I guess it won't take him
too long to figure it out,'' he said.
   Scholars estimate that Antonio Stradivari made nearly 1,120 of
the prized violins bearing his name before his death in 1737. Less
than a few hundred are believed to exist.
   Gruenberg's whereabouts were not known. Nichols said he believed
that Gruenberg came to Los Angeles on vacation and was staying with
friends.
   The Austrian-born performer and music teacher makes his home in
England and has played with the London Symphony Orchestra. He now
appears as a soloist with leading orchestras in Britain and abroad.
He was made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in
London on July 4.

   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood will try to
hold on to his license as a ship's master at a Coast Guard hearing
to determine if he was guilty of negligence in the nation's worst
oil spill.
   Today's administrative law hearing comes just four months after
the skipper of the Exxon Valdez was acquitted in Alaska on similar
charges.
   The judge, Harry J. Gardner, could elect to dismiss all charges,
revoke Hazelwood's license or place him on probation, according to
the Coast Guard and Hazelwood's lawyers. No fine or prison term can
be levied.
   Hazelwood was accused of breaking a Coast Guard rule by drinking
alcohol within four hours of assuming command of his ship and
leaving the ship's bridge while the vessel was traveling through
Prince William Sound.
   He also was accused of leaving a crewman who did not have a
required license in control of the bridge.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, contended in a telephone
interview Tuesday that any drinking within four hours of sailing
was unintentional because the ship left port an hour earlier than
scheduled.
   He argued the Coast Guard had waived its requirement that the
person in control of the bridge have a pilotage license for Prince
William Sound and said the Coast Guard did not adequately monitor
the Exxon Valdez via radar.
   The Exxon Valdez was en route from the Alaskan port of Valdez to
Long Beach on March 24, 1989, when it struck a charted reef. Gashed
by jagged rocks, the 987-foot tanker spilled nearly 11 million
gallons of Alaska crude oil.
   Hazelwood was acquitted of being drunk and reckless, but was
convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil.
He was ordered to pay $50,000 restitution and spend 1,000 hours
cleaning beaches at Prince William Sound. He is appealing the
verdict.

   NASA detected a hydrogen leak during
testing today of Atlantis' fuel tank, which could mean a trip back
to the hangar for the shuttle and further reduction of NASA's 1990
flight plans.
   This morning's test was the third filling of Atlantis' external
fuel tank in hopes of pinpointing the leak's source. The shuttle
had been scheduled to blast off on a classified Pentagon flight in
mid-July.
   There was no immediate indication how much fuel escaped during
today's testing, but it appeared to exceed allowed amounts.
   ``It is currently unclear where the leaks were originating
from,'' said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham. ``We are analyzing
the situation.''
   Space agency workers had tightened bolts in Atlantis' porous
fuel line, but officials doubted that would be enough to correct
the problem.
   The space shuttle Columbia also is crippled by a hydrogen leak
and is being fixed. If no leaks had occurred in Atlantis today,
NASA would have tried to launch it in mid-August and Columbia in
September. The possibility of launching both shuttles in the next
two months was uncertain after the leak reappeared.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration today also
planned to launch an Atlas rocket bearing a government satellite
designed to illuminate the Earth's usually invisible magnetic
fields with brightly colored gas cloud displays.
   Atlantis' leak was believed to be in a flange in a pipe that
carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to the main engines.
   Plastic bags to isolate leaking gas and about 20 sensors were
placed over the flange and elsewhere in the fuel line to help find
the source of the leak.
   Atlantis' leak was discovered during the first so-called tanking
test, on June 29. That prompted NASA to temporarily ground its
three-shuttle fleet. The leak also appeared during a more elaborate
test two weeks later.
   Columbia's leak, believed to be larger and in a different place,
was detected during fueling for a May 30 launch attempt. The leaky
plumbing has been replaced with components from the new shuttle
Endeavour, under construction in California.
   If Atlantis goes back to the hangar, NASA could attach a new
external tank and roll the shuttle back to the launch pad for a
September liftoff, or move Columbia out to the pad for a September
flight with the Astro observatory.
   NASA officials want to get at least one of the shuttles up
before Discovery's October mission with the sun-probing Ulysses
satellite. Discovery must lift off between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23 or
the mission will be delayed 13 months, when Earth is in proper
alignment again with the sun and Jupiter.

<HEAD>East German Prime Minister Tries to Keep Government From
Unraveling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
convened his Cabinet today, but there were two empty chairs because
one party pulled out of the government in a clash over united
German elections.
   The departure of the centrist Liberal Party, and a threat by the
left-leaning Social Democrats to follow suit, has jeopardized the
broad coalition chosen to steer the nation to unity with West
Germany.
   The Social Democrats, the nation's second-biggest party, have
said they will leave the government by Friday unless their demands
are met.
   Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, president of the Parliament and a
Christian Democrat, pleaded for unity and told the Liberals that
they can return to the government.
   ``The door to the coalition is not entirely shut,'' she said of
the dispute, which could delay reunification if it worsens.
   The Social Democrats and the Liberals want East Germany to
dissolve itself on Dec. 1 and for single elections across German
lands to be held on Dec. 2.
   Parties would need at least 5 percent of the vote from the
entire combined electorate to be represented in a new united
Parliament.
   De Maiziere and several smaller parties, including the former
Communists ousted last year, want East Germany to wait until just
after the Dec. 2 elections before it ceases to be a nation.
   The elections would be held separately in both German states.
   How a party did in its own country would determine its
representation in Parliament. Under that scenario, a party would
have a far better chance of winning 5 percent of the vote in East
Germany than if the electorates were combined.
   That proposal would increase the likelihood that smaller East
German political parties would get seats in a new Parliament.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, like de Maiziere a Christian
Democrat, wants smaller East German conservative parties to win
seats so they can bolster a Christian Democrat coalition.
   The Social Democrats believe they will be hurt by the separate
elections because it would split the left-leaning vote among
smaller leftist parties.
   Political analysts say the outcome of the feud could help
determine whether Kohl, or the Social Democrats, govern a united
Germany.
   The Liberals resigned from the government late Tuesday and the
two Liberals in the Cabinet _ Regional Affairs Minister Manfred
Preiss and Construction Minister Axel Viehwege _ stayed away from a
Cabinet meeting this morning.
   The Liberals hold 21 of the 400 seats in Parliament and two of
the 26 ministries.
   If the Social Democrats also leave the government, de Maiziere
could lose control of Parliament, where a two-thirds majority is
needed to enact unification.
   However, all major parties are committed to unification. The
strife, if not settled, would more likely slow the process rather
than derail it.
   In an interview with the West German newspaper Bild today, de
Maiziere was quoted as saying the Liberals' departure ``would not
hinder my government'' and that the process of unifying Germany
would be completed.
   De Maiziere later flew to Vienna for a meeting with Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. The two were to discuss economic ties.
   The East German leader also had reportedly planned to consult
with Kohl, who is vacationing in Austria, on the government crisis.
But a de Maiziere spokesman said no meeting was planned.

<HEAD>Mandela Says ANC Will Halt Violence Once Reforms Are Made</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said today the
African National Congress will halt its armed struggle as soon as
the government meets its demands for political reforms, and
possibly sooner.
   Mandela indicated the ANC might accept a government commitment
to change, rather than insisting on the reforms being implemented
before armed action ceases.
   ``The government must remove all the obstacles. Then we will
suspend the armed struggle,'' Mandela said, adding that the timing
of the cease-fire was negotiable.
   But Mandela also said, ``As long as apartheid is the case, the
armed struggle will go on.''
   The ANC, of which Mandela is deputy president, is demanding the
government allow thousands of exiles to return home without fear of
arrest; free prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes;
stop trials for politically motivated acts; repeal laws restricting
political freedom; and lift the state of emergency in Natal
province.
   Until these changes are made, the ANC has said it will not
participate in formal negotiations with the government on ending
apartheid to give the black majority a say in national affairs.
   The government wants the ANC to formally end its military
activities before negotiations begin.
   Mandela told a news conference the ANC leadership was confident
progress would be made on clearing away the obstacles at an Aug. 6
meeting with government officials.
   The ANC National Executive Committee decided at a two-day
meeting that it will definitely suspend all armed activites once
the obstacles have been removed, he said. He added that ANC
guerrillas have not killed anyone since talks with the government
began in May.
   He acknowledged that the ANC leadership was having difficulty
getting word to members of its guerrilla wing _ Spear of the Nation
_ about the plan to suspend armed activity.
   ``The men ... who have been deployed in the country are still
operating according to the old instructions and we have been trying
to reach all of them,'' Mandela said.
   The government and ANC agreed to commit themselves to a peaceful
resolution of the country's problems during talks in May, two
months after President F.W. de Klerk freed Mandela from prison and
legalized the ANC after a 30-year ban.
   The government has granted amnesty to certain ANC leaders and
allowed them to enter the country to begin reforming the
organization.
   However, it is still illegal for ANC guerrillas to infiltrate
and store weapons. In addition, de Klerk has not lifted the state
of emergency in Natal province, the site of black factional
fighting.
   Mandela said no infiltrations of guerrillas had occurred since
the May 2-4 peace talks.
   He also denied local news reports of an alleged plot by
Communist members of the ANC military wing to mount an
insurrection. ``I don't need to repudiate anybody because there is
no such plot,'' he said.
   His comment about ANC members not having killed anyone since May
seemed to refer specifically to planned and directed activities by
its armed wing.
   In fighting between ANC supporters and rival black groups,
hundreds of people have died in the past few months, and ANC
opponents say guerrilla wing members have participated in the
violence.
   The fighting has pitted ANC affiliates against the Zulu-based
Inkatha political party in Natal province.

   Morty Nevins, the accordion-playing
member of The Three Suns group of the 1940s and '50s, has died. He
was 73.
   Nevins, the last surviving member of the original group, died of
cancer Friday at his Beverly Hills home, his daughter, Ferielle
Faine said Tuesday.
   The Three Suns sold several million records over a 20-year span,
including ``Peg o' My Heart'' and the trio's signature tune,
``Twilight Time.''
   Nevins' brother, Al, played guitar while his cousin, Artie Dunn,
sang and played the organ.
   The Three Suns performed for radio, played club and hotel dates
across the nation and were regulars on singer Kate Smith's
television show in the early 1950s.
   The original members disbanded when Al's health began to
deteriorate, but Dunn recruited other musicians for several years.
   Nevins continued to compose music, producing such hit tunes as
``These Things I Offer You for a Lifetime,'' ``Lovers' Gold,''
``You Are My Destiny'' and ``Midnight for Two.''
   Al Nevins died in 1965, and Dunn in 1989.

   The head of the Arianespace rocket launching

d'Allest, president of Arianespace since its creation in 1980,
would be leaving shortly to become second-in-command at the French
aerospace company Matra.
   D'Allest, 50, said he had planned the move for several months
but did not want to leave until Arianespace overcame the February
failure with a successful mission. He is expected to be replaced by
Arianespace's director general, Charles Bigot.
   Tuesday's flight put the five-channel French television
satellite TDF 2 and the 11-channel DFS Kopernikus 2, for West
Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, into geostationary orbit,
always staying above the same spot on the Earth's surface at an
altitude of 22,328 miles.
   Ariane Flight 37 was the first launch of a European rocket since
an Ariane carrying two Japanese communications satellites blew up
less than two minutes after takeoff Feb. 22. Launches were
suspended after the accident.
   February's failure was the fifth in the Ariane series and was
particularly costly because Arianespace had lobbied hard for the
Japanese contracts.
   Bigot, who was present for Tuesday's launch, said the flight was
doubly important.
   ``It is putting into orbit two satellites of the countries who
have given the most support to Ariane politically, technologically
and industrially. It is also the flight in which we pick up after
the failure of Flight 36,'' he said.
   Ariane rockets dominate the private aerospace industry, carrying
about half the world's commercial payloads into space. Arianespace,
the commercial partner of the European Space Agency, has contracts
worth $2.8 billion to launch 37 more satellites.
   The next mission is scheduled for Aug. 30, putting into orbit a
telecommunications satellite for Eutelsat and a British military
satellite, Skynet-4C.
   Arianespace is a consortium made up of aerospace, electronics
and banking companies from 11 countries _ Belgium, Britain,
Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland,
Sweden and West Germany.
   Its rockets have sent into space 45 commercial satellites from
Canada, France, West Germany, Britain, India, Italy, Spain and the
United States, as well as international organizations such as
Intelsat and Eutelsat.
   Ariane is facing increased competition, however, from American
private-sector rockets including the Titan-4 made by Martin
Marietta Corp., General Dynamics' Atlas-Centaur and the Delta built
by McDonnell Douglas.

   One of Rep. Doug Barnard's Republican
opponents announced his candidacy under a billboard showing a giant
check for $20,000. ``Give the money back, Congressman Barnard,''
the text demands.
   The pressure is on, and so is the race by many politicians to
get rid of campaign contributions linked to the savings and loan
industry.
   Rising public outrage over the multibillion-dollar thrift mess
is making the return of S&amp;L money an increasingly popular means of
declaring independence from the troubled industry.
   While Barnard, D-Ga., a senior member of the House Banking
Committee, deliberates over what to do with his S&amp;L contributions,
some lawmakers are marking checks ``return to sender.''
   Others are mailing the money to the U.S. Treasury, often
earmarking their checks for deficit reduction or the fight against
S&amp;L fraud. One signed a $98,950 check on Monday and dispatched it
to his home state.
   ``I didn't want to have it go to build MX missiles,'' said Sen.
Tim Wirth, D-Colo., explaining Tuesday why he sent the money to the
Colorado treasury.
   Wirth, a Banking Committee member who does not face re-election
until 1992, said many of his colleagues are cornering him to ask
questions about what he did.
   ``There's a tremendous feeling of liberation,'' he said. ``I
think you're going to see a lot of people doing it, including
leadership people.''
   Aides to Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas are poring
over a decade of records to find contributors associated with
troubled thrifts. Dole says he's ``prepared to return'' tainted
contributions to the Treasury.
   Here's what some others are doing:
   _Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said he was sending the Treasury $120,000 _ all the
money he has received from thrift interests and kept since 1983. In
1988, Riegle returned $78,250 he had received from Charles Keating,
operator of the failed Lincoln S&amp;L of Irvine, Calif.
   _Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., running for re-election this year,
plans to send the Treasury contributions he's received from people
or organizations that are under investigation for wrongdoing in
connection with a thrift failure. The money will be earmarked for
the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency cleaning up the S&amp;L mess.
   _Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., a Senate candidate, is sending the
RTC a check for $9,000 _ all the money he has gotten from S&amp;L
interests since he first ran for Congress in 1979. Earlier this
year he returned two contributions from board members of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan, a failed Denver thrift.
   _Rep. Dan Schaefer, R-Colo., is searching for S&amp;L-linked
contributions dating from 1983, when he joined Congress. The total
_ expected to be nearly $7,000 _ will be sent to the Treasury's
public fund for debt reduction.
   _Rep. Lindsay Thomas, D-Ga., returned $1,100 to a political
action committee affiliated with Great Southern Federal Savings &amp;
Loan in Savannah to ``avoid any possibility of criticism or
misunderstanding.'' His letter was dated June 27, five days after
the S&amp;L had been taken over by a Georgia bank in a federally
supervised proceeding.
   The Democratic National Committee recently returned a $5,000
contribution from someone linked to the S&amp;L scandal, but it refused
to identify the contributor.
   DNC Chairman Ron Brown said last week that the party would
return contributions ``that are determined to be illegal or where
the circumstances surrounding the contribution suggest illegality.''
   A Colorado Senate candidate, Democrat Carlos Lucero, has
demanded that the Republican National Committee give the Treasury a
$100,000 contribution that came from Ken Good after he had declared
bankruptcy and defaulted on loans from Silverado.
   RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the party is reviewing its
contribution records and ``will consider giving back money,'' but
she said it would be premature to discuss contributions from
specific people or organizations.
   ``We have to define our terms _ what is taint, how do you define
it,'' Ms. Goodman said. ``We're certainly not going to slur
anybody's reputation with the implication of guilt and we're not
going to act capriciously.''
   Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the House Republican campaign
committee, has recommended that candidates ship their S&amp;L
contributions to the Treasury. But the chairman of the committee,
Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, says he'll do no such thing.
   Deciding what constitutes tainted money and sifting through
reams of records to find it can be a complicated business. Some
lawmakers have simplified matters by making a clean sweep of all
S&amp;L contributions.
   ``We couldn't make a distinction between good S&amp;Ls and bad
S&amp;Ls,'' Wirth said. The result was his renunciation of nearly
$100,000.
   ``I was just crushed when I found out how much money it was,''
Wirth said, only half-joking. ``But it was probably the best money
decision I ever made in a campaign.''

<HEAD>Five Killed, 12 Wounded in Renewed Clashes For Disputed Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDMOND SHEDID</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-Syrian militiamen fought sporadic
gunbattles with Iranian-backed rival Shiite Moslems in a strategic
hilltop village, leaving at least five combatants dead and 12
wounded, police said today.
   The fighting came a day after the two sides battled
house-to-house in an inconclusive showdown for control of the
village of Jarjou.
   The new casualties raised the overall death toll to 144 killed
and 439 wounded since the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of
God, captured Jarjou from the more secular Amal militia in a
surprise attack on July 16. Hezbollah's seizure of the village was
aimed at expanding its area of control as far as the Mediterranean
coast to open a badly needed supply line to Iran.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting intermittently for more
than three years for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect. Almost 2,000 people have been killed and
over 4,000 wounded in that struggle.
   Tens of thousands of people continue to flee the current
fighting in the region of Iqlim al-Tufah, or Apple Province, where
Jarjou is located.
   Police said 50,000 of the province's 75,000 people have left the
area. The independent An-Nahar newspaper said Tuesday that only
five of Jarjou's original 5,000 inhabitants remain in the town.
   ``There is no more life in Jarjou,'' said Khadijeh Mukalled, a
56-year-old refugee who fled.
   ``Every morning when I woke up I didn't believe I was still
alive,'' she told reporters in the southern port city of Sidon.
``My house was set ablaze by shellfire. I tried to put off the fire
but I couldn't.''
   ``At last I decided to escape the hell of Jarjou,'' she said.
   Police said no new attacks were mounted today and that the only
fighting was sporadic exchanges of machine gun and rocket-propelled
grenade fire around Jarjou and the surrounding towns.
   On Tuesday, about 1,500 fighters of the pro-Syrian Amal militia
launched a pre-dawn attack on Jarjou behind a rain of mortar shells
and rockets. They were backed by about 500 pro-Syrian Lebanese
Baath Party militiamen.
   Police said they captured new positions around the village and
appeared to be resting for a new assault.
   The Baathist intervention on Amal's side suggests that Syrian
President Hafez Assad wants to curb Iran's growing influence in
Lebanon. Assad is leader of the Syrian Baath party.
   Syria maintains an estimated 40,000 troops in northern, eastern
and central Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab
League and regards Lebanon as its own backyard.
   Ayoub Homayed, second-in-command to Amal chieftain Nabih Berri,
called Hezbollah's occupation of Jarjou an Iranian invasion.
   He said in a statement published by An-Nahar that Amal planned
to lodge a complaint to the U.N. Security Council against ``the
Iranian invasion of the south which is a very dangerous move that
threatens the future of our land and people.''

   A U.S. Navy attack bomber crashed in
the South China Sea on a routine night mission, a spokesman of the
Navy's 7th Fleet said today. The pilot and navigator were reported
missing.
   Lt. Lee Saunders said the Grumman A-6E Intruder crashed about
8:30 p.m. Tuesday almost 400 miles southwest of the Subic Bay naval
base. Subic is about 50 miles west of Manila.
   Saunders said the plane left the aircraft carrier USS
Independence on night flying operations but failed to return. The
names of the pilot and the navigator were being witheld pending
notification of next of kin, he added.
   However, Howard Thomas, a spokesman for the Whidbey Island Naval
Air Station in Washington, where the plane was based, identified
the missing pilot as Lt. Cmdr. Jeffrey Mines, 35, of North Bend,
Neb., and the navigator as Lt. Cmdr. Arthur Braun, 37, of
Georgetown, Texas.
   An extensive search for the two missing crewmen was under way,
Saunders said. He added that the cause of the accident is under
investigation.
   The Grumman-built A-6E is an all-weather carrier bomber.

<HEAD>Judge Drops All But One Pornography Count Against Former Day-Care
Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dropped all but one
charge of possessing child pornography against a former day-care
center owner who allegedly had hundreds of photographs of nude
children.
   Police had charged John Shaver, 56, with 29 counts of possessing
child pornography after police said they found the photographs at
his home across from his now-closed Rainbow Learning Center.
   Shaver faced up to seven years in prison if convicted on all
counts. One count would be punishable by up to 22 months.
   Broward Circuit Judge Robert Tyson Jr. dropped the charges
Tuesday after defense attorney J. David Bogenschutz cited a recent
state appellate court ruling that defendants can only be charged
with one count of pornography possession no matter how many
photographs they own.
   ``It's boiled down to a case of some alleged dirty pictures,''
Bogenschutz said about a police investigation that had widened into
whether children at the day-care center had been abused. ``And
these pictures aren't even of any children in the day-care.''
   Bogenschutz said the state's case, expected to go to trial in
September, has fallen apart. But prosecutor Brian Trehy disagreed.
   ``Nobody ever said this was more than a case of child
pornography,'' Trehy said. ``Somehow people got the impression that
this was a case of sexual abuse and there was never any evidence of
that.''
   Trehy said police had interviewed children who attended the
day-care center and their parents because it was ``prudent in light
of the situation to at least inquire whether there had been any
abuse.''

   Federal prosecutors are investigating
allegations that South Carolina's top FBI agent avoided a drunken
driving arrest with the help of the state's chief highway
patrolman, sources said.
   Justice Department officials were expected to arrive here today
to begin the investigation of Fred Verinder, the FBI's special
agent-in-charge for the state, government sources told The
Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Verinder was taken home March 23 rather than to jail by Col.
J.H. ``Red'' Lanier, the state highway department's director of law
enforcement, the source said. The FBI agent was stopped north of
Columbia after state trooper John Osborne saw a government car
weaving and running off the road, sources said.
   Verinder failing a field sobriety test, according to sources who
saw an affidavit from the trooper. The failure included his
inability to recite the alphabet.
   The agent then scuffled with Osborne, who handcuffed him and put
him in the patrol car, where Verinder convinced the trooper to
phone Lanier, who came to the scene and took him home.
   Verinder was cited for alleged speeding, but never was given a
breath test for alcohol nor charged with drunken driving.
   An official at the FBI's Columbia office who refused to give his
name said he had been told to say Verinder refused to comment on
the incident. The official would not connect a reporter with
Verinder.
   Lanier denied he did anything wrong, saying the trooper never
told him Verinder failed the field sobriety test.
   ``He had been drinking, (Verinder) told me that, but he wasn't
drunk,'' Lanier said. ``(Verinder) told me he'd had several
drinks.''
   Lanier denied his actions had anything to do with a federal
investigation of the highway department, which oversees
construction as well as law enforcement.
   The FBI is one of several agencies investigating allegations
that highway department employees took money from contractors.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' Lanier said. ``He can't control an
investigation that the State Law Enforcement Division, the IRS and
the FBI, that three agencies are doing.''
   Sources said Gov. Carroll Campbell was notified of the incident
about a month later. The governor told the AP Tuesday night that he
ordered the case brought to the attention of U.S. Attorney Bart
Daniel and top state prosecutors.
   ``The fact that the statement had been made verbally that the
head of the FBI (in South Carolina) had been assisted by the head
of the highway patrol could have compromised the investigation,''
Campbell said.
   The governor met with Highway Department chief Joseph G.
Rideoutte and Highway Commission chairman Charles E. Dalton Tuesday
about the allegations. Campbell refused to discuss Lanier's future.
   Rideoutte said he was investigating the incident, but wasn't
considering firing Lanier.

   Maybe, in the great expanse beyond the
Washington Beltway, there was some other topic of conversation.
Maybe somewhere people talked about the weather or George
Steinbrenner, or the Dow. In Washington, the subject was David
Souter.
   In law offices, at the National Organization for Women, in the
rooms at the National Right to Life Committee, at the Washington
Legal Foundation, in the offices of newspapers, wire services,
television networks, in Senate offices, at the Justice Department,
in the FBI and around the water coolers in dozens of offices around
the city the great search was on for the life and times, the
opinions and ideological bent of David Souter.
   Mead Data Central, which supplies legal information with its
computerized Lexis service and news and business information with
Nexis, said searches of files containing information about Souter
jumped 10 percent from Monday to Tuesday.
   The increase, from 4,500 to 5,000 searches, was in cases of the
new Hampshire Supreme Court, of the attorney general's office when
Souter was there, and of the 1st Circuit of the United States Court
of Appeals.
   Souter, as in suitor. An overnight celebrity, the man of the
hour, President Bush's mystery nominee to be associate justice of
the Supreme Court.
   In an instant, a research industry was born.
   ``I had heard the name Souter before yesterday,'' said Richard
Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation. ``He had
vaguely been mentioned in connection with the (Anthony) Kennedy
nomination years ago.''
   That's as far as the knowledge about Souter went when President
Bush presented him late Monday in the White House press room. Even
the president did not seem to know much about Souter's opinions.
   ``In my view it would have been inappropriate to ask him his
views on specific issues,'' said Bush. ``More important are the
broad concepts of excellence, is the man qualified, does he share a
broad view that what he ought to do on the bench is interpret the
Constitution and not legislate. And so that's all I need.''
   Samp, along with others trying to get a handle on Souter, turned
to the great computerized legal data banks for information. The
nominee has been a federal appeals judge only since April and, said
Samp, ``he has had absolutely zero written opinions to date.''
   But Souter also was on the New Hampshire Supreme Court for seven
years and an associate justice of the state superior court for five
years before that _ a 12-year paper trail. The handy thing about
judging judges: part of their job is explaining their decisions.
   ``We have gotten a printout of all his decisions, we are talking
about 700-800 if we include every opinion of the New Hampshire
Supreme Court issued during the time he was on the bench,'' said
Samp. ``If we are looking at the ones he authored, there will be
100-150.''
   Five noted conservatives held a news conference Tuesday
afternoon to say how they stood on the nomination. Four stood on
yes and one on no. All five said they didn't know much about Souter.
   ``There remain too many unanswered questions about who he is and
how this nomination came about,'' said Peter Flaherty, chairman of
the Conservative Campaign Fund, former chairman of Citizens for
Reagan, and the one who said no. ``This man has been on the planet
for 50 years, never given a speech, written an article.''
   Robert Grant, president of the American Freedom Coalition, said
all he knows about Souter is what he read in the paper. ``There's a
dearth of real information,'' he said. ``A pig in a poke. The big
question is what do we have in this 50-year-old man who lives alone
on a farm in the mountains of New Hampshire.''
   Richard Viguerie, chairman of United Conservatives of America,
said most conservatives are cautious supporters who approve with
nervous smiles.
   As for Souter, the subject of all this, his first full day as a
nominee was spent in the White House where presidential aides told
him what he could expect at the Senate confirmation hearings. They
told him everything he had ever written could be picked on, that
his personal life would be scrutinized.
   According to reports, the man who has the answers to all the
questions didn't seem too concerned about the prospect.

<HEAD>Drug Raid Turns Up Illegal Sea Turtles and Coral</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A search for drugs on a Korean tanker
revealed stuffed sea turtles belonging to an endangered species and
about five tons of coral from protected Philippine reefs.
   ``This is unique. We've never seen this amount of coral
before,'' said Rick Ellison, chief of U.S. Customs inspectors for
the San Francisco waterfront.
   Importation of the items violates federal and international laws
prohibiting transporting and possessing endangered or protected
wildlife.
   Eight stuffed green sea turtles, one over 3 feet long, and 1,100
blooms of coral were seized last week from the ship, the Bum Dong,
which has since left for Korea. No charges were filed.
   Crew members said the items were destined for Korea, authorities
said.
   There is an active market in endangered wildlife items in South
Korea because it is not party to an international treaty regulating
trade in such species, said Ginette Hemley with the World Wildlife
Fund in Washington, D.C.
   The eight turtles were valued at between $3,000 and $5,000, with
the coral estimated to be worth $30,000, said Scott Pearson of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Customs had been tipped that the ship, hauling coconut oil,
might be carrying drugs, said Ellison.
   He said no drugs were found, but the coral and turtles were
found in the living areas of the 444-foot ship.

   The 1986 Contra supply plane crash that led to
revelations of U.S. involvement in the Iran-Contra affair is at the
center of a civil lawsuit that opened today against Richard Secord
and a CIA-linked airline.
   Eugene Hasenfus, the sole survivor when Sandinista forces shot
down his C-132 in Nicaragua during a supply run, has accused Secord
and Southern Air Transport of misleading him and using planes that
were ``wholly inadequate and dilapidated.''
   Hasenfus, who was captured by the government troops and held for
three months, is joined in the lawsuit by the family of Wallace
Sawyer Jr., the co-pilot who died in the October 1986 crash.
   Jury selection began today with Hasenfus expected to take the
stand later in the day as the first witness. Secord also was
present.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 8
to lying to congressional investigators when he said he wasn't
aware of any money that went to Oliver North's benefit from the
maze of companies he had used in the Iran-Contra affair. Secord on
Jan. 24 was sentenced to two years probation.
   When the suit was filed in 1988, attorneys had estimated damages
at $135 million, but on Tuesday the judge asked for more specific
figures.
   Following the crash, the Reagan administration, faced with
evidence found in the plane, acknowledged money was diverted from
Iran arms sales to the Contra supply operation.
   The suit says Hasenfus was recruited in 1986 through the
Pennsylvania airline Corporate Air Services and William Cooper, a
Southern Air pilot.
   Cooper, who also died in the crash, led Hasenfus to believe
``the Contra resupply operation was being run `right out of the
back door of the White House' '' by North, Secord and Southern Air,
the suit said.
   Hasenfus and the Sawyer family claim Secord misrepresented the
nature of the flights and failed to take routine safety precautions
such as providing parachutes.
   Southern Air, once owned by the CIA, has denied any association
with the Hasenfus flight, even though the plane was registered to
Corporate Air, which had the same office address as Southern Air.

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
manufactured goods plunged 3.2 percent in June, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said that demand for durable goods,
items expected to last three or more years, suffered a May-to-June
decline of $4.14 billion to a seasonally adjusted $124.69 billion
last month.
   The report caught analysts by surprise. They had been expecting
a healthy increase following on the heels of a 4.2 percent rise in
May.
   The decline, the third in the past six months, served to
emphasize the problems besetting the U.S. manufacturing sector.
   In another economic report today, a real estate trade group
reported that sales of existing homes in June posted their first
increase since last September.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes, bolstered by falling mortgage rates, rose a
modest 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.34
million units.
   Durable goods orders are considered a key signpost for the
future since a drop in orders normally triggers cutbacks in
production plans and job layoffs.
   The 3.2 percent June decline was the weakest performance since a
4.1 percent drop in April. Orders had fallen 10.5 percent in
January, the biggest drop on record.
   For the first six months of the year, orders totaled $744.7
billion, 1.5 percent below the same period in 1989, indicating how
sluggish demand has been this year. In fact, the monthly level of
$124.69 billion in orders was 5.6 percent below the record level of
orders reached more than two years ago.
   The June weakness was widespread across all industry groups.
About half of the decline was attributed to a 20.7 percent drop in
orders for military hardware, the biggest setback in the defense
category since a 33.6 percent drop in January.
   The military sector tends to be extremely volatile, depending on
the timing of government contracts.
   But even without the big defense decrease, durable goods orders
would have been down 1.7 percent.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods,
considered a good barometer of businesses plans to expand and
modernize, were up a small 0.3 percent after declines of 1.4
percent in May and 10.6 percent in April.
   The largest industry decline came in transportation, down 4.8
percent to $33.8 billion. Most of this decline came in aircraft
orders.
   Electrical machinery was down 3.9 percent to $19.9 billion with
electronic components accounting for most of the decrease.
   The machinery category, which includes computers, fell 3.2
percent to $21.7 billion.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel fell 4.9 percent to
$11.3 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods increased slightly in June, up a
modest 0.5 percent to $127.3 billion. For the first half of 1990,
shipments totaled $740.9 billion, 1.1 percent above the first half
of 1989.

<DATELINE>ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today two men were
being questioned about an IRA bombing that killed three police
officers and the first nun to die in Northern Ireland's sectarian
conflict.
   The IRA's political wing said it regretted the deaths but blamed
British policy in Northern Ireland.
   The three officiers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary police _
the force of the Protestant-dominated British province _ died
instantly when an estimated half-ton of explosives was detonated
beneath their car on a rural highway just after 2 p.m. Tuesday,
police said.
   The nun, Sister Catherine Dunne, who was in an oncoming car,
died at a hospital shortly after the blast. A 25-year-old social
worker who was a passenger in the nun's car, Cathy McCann, was
injured. She was reported in satisfactory condition this morning.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, said in a statement it
``deeply regrets all deaths which occur as a result of this
conflict, whether they be those of active participants in the
conflict or innocent victims, like Sister Catherine Dunne.''
   But the statement issued by the Republican Press Center in
Belfast said the conflict continues because of Britain's
``insistence on placing obstacles in the way of a genuine peace
process.''
   Police said two men were arrested at their homes not far from
the scene of the explosion on the outskirts of Armagh. They were
being questioned about ``serious terrorist crimes'' in the Armagh
area, including the latest bombing, said a police spokesman, who
under standing rules was not identified.
   The explosion blasted a crater nearly 10 feet deep, crushed the
policemen's car and flipped it over, and knocked the nun's small
car off the road.
   An anonymous caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the
mainly Catholic IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   Protestant and Catholic leaders joined in vigorous condemnation
of the attack.
   Catholic Bishop Cahal Daly said the death of Sister Catherine
added ``a new dimension of poignancy and horror,'' but he said
there were ``no legitimate targets _ all four people murdered were
innocent victims of a senseless and evil campaign.''
   Two of the three police officers were married, and they had a
total of six young children.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey called the slayings
``utterly futile,'' and Ireland's Anglican primate, the Most Rev.
Robin Eames, expressed his ``absolute disgust at the brutal attack
on policemen and civilians.''
   The Irish News, a Belfast daily which serves the Catholic
community, said in today's editions that an anonymous caller
claimed responsibility on behalf of the IRA.
   ``The second battalion, North Armagh Brigade, claims
responsibility for the military action at Armagh today,'' the
caller said.
   He did not give a recognized code word, which often accompanies
IRA statements, the newspaper said.
   Nor was there any apology, such as the one the IRA offered after
killing two Australian tourists in the Netherlands on May 28 or the
6-month-old daughter of a British soldier in West Germany on Oct.
26.
   Police said the latest bomb apparently was triggered from a
nearby bungalow while the occupants, including young children, were
held hostage.
   The three officers killed were identified as Constable William
James Hanson, 37, of Armagh, and reserve officers Joshua Cyril
Willis, 35, of Caledon, and David Sterritt, 34, from Markethill.
   The IRA killed four soldiers with a similar bomb beneath a road
on April 9. Attacks against police officers and soldiers are a
trademark of the IRA and smaller groups fighting British rule.
   The IRA wants to unite the province with the 95 percent Catholic
Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Sister Catherine, a native of Dublin and a member of the Sisters
of St. Louis, was deputy director of St. Joseph's Training School,
a training center for young offenders, in Middletown, 10 miles
outside Armagh.
   At the Middletown Convent, where Sister Catherine lived with 15
other nuns, she was remembered as ``a lovely young woman full of
life and joy'' by Sister Fiona Fullam, regional superior of the St.
Louis Sisters.
   She said the nun's funeral would be held Friday at the convent.
   The Irish News said she was the first nun among the nearly 2,800
deaths attributed to sectarian and political violence since 1969.
Two priests were killed in the early 1970s, it said.
   The 21-year death toll includes 273 police officers and
reservists.
   Armagh is the ecclesiastical capital of all Ireland, and the
cathedrals of the Catholic and Anglican primates dominate its
skyline.
   According to tradition, the city owes its prominence to St.
Patrick, who chose it as his seat.

<HEAD>Fiji Adopts Constitution Ensuring Dominance of Ethnic Fijians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiji adopted a constitution today that
guarantees native Fijians a majority in both houses of a new
Parliament.
   The constitution calls for the native Fijians to be allocated 37
of the 70 seats in a House of Representatives and 24 of the 34
Senate seats.
   The guaranteed majority has been a demand of the military, which
overthrew a coalition dominated by ethnic Indians in 1987. The
military said the coup was necessary to protect the rights of
indigenous Fijians.
   Native Fijians and ethnic Indians each comprise slightly less
than half of the 720,000 people in Fiji, an island nation in the
South Pacific.
   Indians were a majority before the coup, which was followed by a
second military takeover in 1987, but emigration has since depleted
their numbers.
   President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, a native Fijian, promulgated
the document following Cabinet approval, calling it ``an historic
and solemn duty'' and asking for national reconciliation.
   He said in a nationally broadcast radio speech that the
constitution would ``immediately take effect as the supreme law of
the land.'' He added that he hoped elections would be held next
year.
   Indian leaders have branded the constitution as ``racist,
feudalistic and undemocratic'' and said they would boycott the
planned elections.
   The constitution has not yet been released publicly.
   Ganilau said the coups were the result of a growing sense of
insecurity among native Fijians because Indians dominated commerce,
finance and industry.
   ``It seems only fair and just that the Fijian position should be
strengthened in some areas to compensate for its weaknesses in
others.''
   He called on Indians, who were brought to Fiji by the British as
indentured sugar-plantation workers, to set aside that memory,
along with ``their sense of grievance about the past.''
   ``Join with the Fijians in sharing the nation's resources and
participating fully in national life,'' Ganilau said.
   The proclamation comes 2{ years after the country was declared a
republic. The 1970 post-independence constitution was revoked
following the second coup.
   In late May, New Delhi said it would launch an international
campaign against Fiji over the new constitution. Fiji ordered the
Indian Embassy closed and expelled its diplomats in retaliation.
   New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer recently criticized
the constitution, saying it would not improve strained bilateral
relations.

   Three Cubans who had sought refuge in the Swiss
Embassy in Havana have voluntarily left, Swiss officials said today.
   The asylum-seekers, who managed to penetrate tight Cuban
security, had entered the Swiss compound on Sunday. They told
diplomats they wanted to leave the country because of restrictions
on free speech.
   The departures, reported by Swiss officials in Havana and Bern,
left 18 Cubans in the Spanish Embassy and four in the home of the
Italian ambassador.
   The wave of asylum-seeking at embassies in Havana began two
weeks ago, not long after similar incidents were occurring at
embassies in Albania. Albania, like Cuba, is a hard-line Communist
state that has refused to follow the lead of other Eastern European
countries in adopting democratic reforms.
   Cuba has contended the asylum-seekers are part of a
U.S.-inspired Western plot to destabilize its Communist government,
a charge the United States and European countries have denied.
   In Bern, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said the departure of the
three came after assurances by Cuban authorities that there would
be no reprisals against them. Ministry spokesman Michel Pache said
the Swiss ambassador to Cuba, Markus Kaiser, planned to stay in
contact with the men and monitor their situation.
   The men had told Swiss diplomats they were being followed by
police, although they gave no individual examples of persecution,
Pache said.
   Although Switzerland had granted the men temporary refuge in the
embassy, it did not recognize them as political refugees, according
to the Foreign Ministry.
   Pache said embassy staff drove two of the Cubans to undisclosed
locations on Tuesday. The third agreed to leave the embassy this
morning.
   Nine of the Cubans in the Spanish Embassy are threatening a
hunger strike to protest what they say is poor food.
   The Spanish and Italians have refused to turn over the
asylum-seekers, which has strained both countries' ties with Cuba.
   Today's departures came one day after a senior Cuban official
demanded the ``unconditional and voluntary'' departure of the
Cubans now being sheltered at foreign embassies.
   Cuba's vice foreign minister, Jose R. Viera, said it is ``not
admissible'' for a Cuban wishing to emigrate to circumvent normal
procedures by forcing his way into an embassy.
   Viera sought to portray the incidents at the embassies as
unrepresentative of the overall situation in Cuba. There has been a
substantial increase in security around many diplomatic missions of
NATO countries.
   The vice foreign minister said the annual carnival celebration
this week has been proceeding normally. The highlight of the
carnival celebration is a speech Thursday by President Fidel Castro
commemorating the 37th anniversary of his debut as a rebel fighter.
   Castro took power in Cuba in 1959.
   While Cuba has called the asylum-seekers ``scum'' and habitual
vagrants and said it will never allow them to leave the island,
Spain has said it will not expel the Cubans and will try instead to
negotiate their departure.
   Last week, reflecting escalating tensions between the two
countries, Spain suspended a $2.5 million aid program to Cuba,
recalled its ambassador and sent four guards to bolster security at
its embassy in Havana.
   Spain's foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, had said
Castro is afraid his hard-line Communist government will fall like
those in Eastern Europe if he allows Cubans to leave. Fernandez
Ordonez also urged a transition to democracy in Cuba.

activity. The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders
for durable goods fell 3.2 percent in June.
   At the same time, however, the data did nothing to dispell
recent worries over a sluggish, erratic pattern in corporate
profits.
   DuPont climbed ~ to 39} in active trading. The company posted
second-quarter profits of $1.02 a share, up from $1 a share in the

   Tourists can now use credit cards for

   The official Vietnam News Agency said Visa International credit
cards have been accepted in Ho Chi Minh City since July 17 under an
agreement between the Vietnam Foreign Trade Bank and the French
Bank of External Commerce.
   The report, dated Tuesday, was seen in Bangkok Wednesday.
   It said card holders can make payments in dollar equivalents at
12 places including major hotels, restaurants, shops and tourist
centers.
   The report said steps were being taken to permit the card's use
in the capital, Hanoi, and in other cities.
   It appears, however, that Americans will not be able to use
their credit cards in Vietnam. The U.S. government clamped a trade
embargo on that nation following the Vietnam war, which ended in
1975.

<TEXT>
   An 81-year-old man convicted of
murdering his ailing wife in what he said was a mercy killing may
be transferred to a more comfortable prison under a state review of
a crackdown on prison security.
   Roswell Gilbert, who suffers from heart and lung diseases, was
moved from a medium-security to a top-security prison earlier this
month after Gov. Bob Martinez ordered all prisoners serving minimum
mandatory sentences for violent offenses be taken out of
less-secure prisons.
   That order came after Donald Dillbeck, serving a mandatory life
sentence in the murder of a policeman, walked away from a
work-release program last month and was charged with killing a
shopper outside a mall.
   Bob Macmaster, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections, said Wednesday that the cases of Gilbert and 46 other
elderly, ill and disabled inmates serving sentences for violent
crimes will be reviewed by Monday for possible transfer to less
secure prisons where they would have more privileges.
   Fifty other inmates whose medical conditions are less serious
also are likely candidates for transfers, said Paula Tully, a
corrections department spokeswoman.
   Gilbert's attorney, Brad Stark, praised the decision to
reconsider the move.
   ``The bottom line is that (Gilbert) finds being in a
maximum-security facility a big strain, emotionally and
physically,'' Stark said.
   Gilbert's 73-year-old wife, Emily, was suffering from
Alzheimer's disease when he shot and killed her on March 4, 1985.

<HEAD>Gunman Killed While Robbing Seven Undercover Police Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOMEWOOD, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An armed robber was shot to death after he
burst into a motel room unaware that seven armed officers were
inside setting up a drug sting, authorities said.
   The man was shot by one of the officers as an accomplice took
their wallets, authorities said.
   The officers were in two adjoining rooms of a Super 8 motel
early Tuesday when Darnell Madison, 37, and Jacqueline Lynn
Simmons, 21, came through the partly open door of one of the rooms,
officers said.
   Madison, armed with a .38-caliber revolver, announced a robbery
and quickly herded the seven officers together. The officers, part
of the Jefferson County drug task force, carried several thousand
dollars that they planned to use to buy drugs and film the deal.
   ``When he came in, I thought he was somebody connected with the
drug deal coming early to rip us off,'' Officer Robert Knight said.
``We figured out pretty quickly, though, that he had no idea we
were there to make a drug deal, much less that we were the police.''
   The gunman told everyone to get on the floor and Simmons to
collect the wallets, sheriff's Sgt. Billy James said.
   Madison repeatedly said he would kill the men if they tried
anything, police said.
   ``We had guns in our holsters, guns on shelves, guns everywhere,
but we couldn't get to them,'' Knight said.
   As the woman started collecting wallets, Madison was distracted
by one officer and another eased his gun out of his holster and
shot the robber five times, police said.
   ``A few seconds later, she would have seen a badge, and that
would have been it,'' Knight said. ``The officer who did the
shooting literally saved our lives. No doubt.''
   Simmons was charged with robbery. She was being held Wednesday
on $100,000 bond.
   Officials said Madison had a lengthy criminal record, and was on
parole for a robbery conviction when he broke into the hotel room.
   Police refused to disclose the identity of the deputy who shot
Madison. Lt. Linn Moore said the officer is not being accused of
any wrongdoing.
   Chief Deputy Frank Rogers said he could not disclose who the
undercover sting unit was targeting when it went to the motel. But
he said the attempted robbery brought the sting plans to a close,
and ``we don't know what happened'' to the drug suspects.

will be great if your team wins, but don't get drunk if they're
beaten badly.
   ``Strine'' is the shorthand pronunciation for Australian
English. The Dictionary Research Center at Sydney's Macquarie
University has been keeping track of changes in the language since
the school published the 2,049-page ``The Macquarie Dictionary'' in
1981.
   While it is not an official dictionary, the Australian
Government Publishing Service used the Macquarie as the main
reference for the government stylebook that is distributed
nationwide.
   So many new words keep popping up that Macquarie has issued the
400-page ``New Words'' supplement to update the evolution in
technology, finance, medicine and slang. Each entry is accompanied
by a notation on the first time the word or phrase was known to
have been used.
   ``We are moving into the force field of international English,
which is very largely influenced by American English,'' said Susan
Butler, the dictionary's editor.
   Hence, Australians now use seppo (American) phrases like ``touch
base'' for making contact with people, ``worst-case scenarios'' and
``ballpark figures.'' Athletes ``tough it out,'' ``pump themselves
up'' and ``lift their game.''
   ``In Australia's history, we've shifted from being entirely
British-dominated to being more independent of our colonial
background,'' Ms. Butler said.
   The roots of some new words are fairly clear _ ``brain bucket''
for a helmet with a face mask, and ``shamateur'' for an athlete who
is paid for playing but retains amateur status. Others are more
murky, such as porky (a lie), frag (a little bit) and brick
(falsify evidence).
   Science has yielded an entire lingo of computerese. To the
outsider, it can be a bewildering jungle of PCs, ROM, RAM, hackers,
bauds, microchips, megabytes and slaves. There's also the
greenhouse effect, faxes, genetic fingerpinting, CFCs
(chlorofluorocarbons) and VFTs (very fast trains).
   The world of finance has produced corporate cowboys, junk bonds,
macro economy, insider trading and evoision (tax avoidance
bordering on illegality).
   AIDS is a word in daily use now, along with other medical terms
such as IVF (in vitro fertilization), SIDS (sudden infant death
syndrome) and passive smoking.
   But slang and verbal shorthand are prime contributors to new
words.
   Yuppie has proved to be a particularly fertile breeder, with
whole generations of offspring: gruppies (environmentally conscious
yuppies), scuppies (sensitive to social issues), puppies
(pretentious), rumpies (rural) and zuppies (zestful).
   Most people know a pippie (someone who has inherited sudden
wealth) who is also a Lombard (rich but lacking class). There are
even yuffies (young urban failures), arpies (asset-rich parents)
and Young Fogeys (young people whose attitudes and style are more
in tune with the old).
   Politicians often spout blat (empty rhetoric) in the bearpit
(place of fierce debate). If they go on for yonks (a long time),
the party leader may send a toecutter (an enforcer) to bring them
in line.
   While chauves (male chauvinists) are far from extinct, women's
liberation has left its mark on language, with femocrat (a feminist
bureaucrat), herstory (women's history), person Friday and sexual
harassment all making their debuts in the dictionary supplement.
   Music always is changing, as the dictionary reflects, with
thrash metal, salsa and rap spawning everything from slam dancing
to dirty dancing, vogueing and headbanging.
   Go to a firestorm (a lively entertainment event) and get blown
away (dazzled) watching the ragers (enthusiastic participants) go
full on (act without reserve or restraint). Maybe the sound will be
rad (wonderful), or it may make you spew (show extreme annoyance).
   Beam me up Scotty (get me out of here).

<HEAD>Britain to Halve Troops in Germany and Reduce Its Armed Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said today that it plans by the mid-1990s
to withdraw half of the more than 66,000 troops it has stationed in
West Germany and to cut the nation's overall regular forces by 18
percent.
   Defense Secretary Tom King, announcing proposed wide-ranging
conventional defense cutbacks to Parliament, also said the
government planned to maintain some 40 Royal Navy warships. The
current ceiling is about 50.
   King proposed that the Royal Air Force be cut from 89,000
personnel to 75,000, and the army from 160,000 to 120,000.
   Britain has 66,700 servicemen and women deployed in West
Germany. They are the second biggest foreign military presence
after the United States.
   The announcement followed a five-month review of defense
expenditure by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a committee of
top Cabinet ministers in the light of a reduced Soviet threat.
   The government, long the most hawkish in NATO and one of the
Western alliance's highest defense spenders, kept news of the
review secret until word leaked several weeks after it began.
   King said Britain will make no reductions in its nuclear
arsenal, retaining the present Polaris missiles and updating them
with four new missile-carrying U.S. Trident submarines within the
next few years.
   ``It is a time of opportunity and hope for change, yet without
putting at risk the safe protection of our country,'' King told the
House of Commons. ``Our aim is an orderly and planned transition to
the new world unfolding.''
   He said Britain will discuss the proposed cutbacks with its NATO
allies.
   And he said implementation hinged on the signing of an East-West
agreement on conventional arms cuts, final arrangements for German
unification, and the pace of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
other East European countries.
   King said the proposals would mean reductions in British defense
expenditure, but he gave no details. The figures would be announced
in an autumn treasury statement, he added.
   In addition, King said there will be further immediate cutbacks
to lop $1.1 billion off the $38.6 billion defense budget for this
fiscal year, which ends in March. ``We shall be easing back on army
recruiting and retiring early several ships and submarines,'' he
said.
   Citing higher-than-expected inflation, the government announced
last month the cancellation of orders for 33 Tornado jet fighters
as a major saving on the current budget.
   Government officials said Mrs. Thatcher discussed the outcome of
the review last week with service chiefs. The Cabinet committee's
report was debated and accepted by the full 22-member Cabinet
Thursday morning.

<HEAD>John Denver Unveils Institute on Global Environment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer John Denver said Wednesday he has
helped establish an institute that will work to save the global
environment.
   The Aspen Institute on Global Change, co-sponsored by the Amway
Corp. of Ada, Mich., the United Nations Environment Program and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will bring leading
scientists together each summer in Aspen, Colo., to trade ideas.
   ``This is not just another think-tank,'' Denver said at a news
conference, adding that saving the global environment is ``the most
important task that faces the human race at this time.''
   Denver said an education and outreach program would try to
bridge the gap between researchers and people who want to be
involved in local environmental action.
   William Nicholson, Amway's chief operating officer, said the
direct marketing company has committed $500,000 to the institute
over the next five years.
   Rick Chappell, associate director of science at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center, said NASA contributed $40,000.
   Chappell said that a possible project would enlist large numbers
of students and others in simple environmental tests at points on
Earth also being monitored from space as a way to check the
accuracy of satellite measurements of Earth conditions.
   ``It would be the ultimate field trip for the kids,'' Chappell
said.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on balancing the budget:
   Once again, Congress has rejected the chimera of a balanced
budget amendment to the Constitution. ...
   The simple, practical truth is that the problem was not created
by a flaw in the rules governing the way budgets are put together.
Nor can the trouble be eliminated by tinkering with those rules,
whether constitutional or merely statutory. The Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law is an example of the latter.
   Rather, a continuing string of excessive deficits has resulted
from political cowardice _ an unwillingness to either raise taxes
to cover expenditures or cut spending to stay within revenues.
Those are the only two ways to balance a federal budget.
   Spurred by Ronald Reagan's election and his crusade against
taxes, the government in 1981 switched from a Democratic policy the
new president derided as ``tax and spend, tax and spend'' to a new
approach: borrow and spend. Borrowing to cover the gaps between
annual expenditures and revenues more than doubled the national
debt in less than a decade and made interest payments on the debt
the third largest item in the budget, consuming 20 percent of
current spending. ...
   The ballooning cost of the savings and loan rescue measures,
among other things, has frightened George Bush into abandoning his
dogmatic opposition to any tax increase. That breakthrough may
create opportunities for the kinds of compromise that will be
essential if current budget negotiations are to achieve success.

   The Repository, Canton, Ohio, on the S&amp;L bailout:
   Have you noticed that public anger over the cost of the S&amp;L
bailout has journeyed upward several notches?
   And there has been a corresponding reaction in Congress to take
some steps to reassure the American people on these points: (1)
That wrongdoers will be prosecuted; (2) that ill-gotten gains will
be confiscated and some of the money paid back to the institutions
from which it was stolen; (3) that legal barn doors are being
closed to keep such a scandal from occurring again.
   There's another point that deserves attention, but is not
getting it. You hear no debate about why it is that all the states
have to share in the bailout regardless of how much (or how little)
of the crookedness occurred within the borders of individual
states. ...
   When the shape of new clean air legislation was being hammered
out in meetings between the administration and Senate leaders, and
then later in Senate debate, no one wanted to hear anything about
the regionalism aspect of the legislation.
   Lawmakers from the West and New England were determined that the
Midwest states would pay more than anyone else because of the
region's reliance on coal-fired utilities. ...
   This is why states in the Midwest have a bigger beef about the
S&amp;L bailout than some others that are not happy about paying for
out-of-control wheeling and dealing, particularly in Texas and
California. It's also why Washington hasn't heard the last of this
issue _ not by a long shot.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on Neil Bush:
   So Neil Bush is angry. He says the Democrats are putting him in
the political food processor because of his name.
   The president's 34-year-old son, former director of Silverado
Savings and Loan Association in Denver, has been charged by thrift
regulators with failing to mention his business relationship with
two important Silverado borrowers.
   So if you think you're mad, Mr. Bush, you should talk to the
American public, which is going to have to bail out all of the
failed thrifts nationwide to the estimated tune of $500 billion.
The tab for Silverado is estimated at $1 billion.
   Congressional Democrats are also up to their necks in the S&amp;L
scandal, and must be willing to take a certain amount of blame.
Congress and the Justice Department must put aside partisan zeal
and fervently seek culpability _ and remedy _ for what is becoming
the nation's largest financial scandal. Even if Mr. Bush gets mad.

   The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel on political undesirables:
   The United states may not have any political prisoners, but it
does have a very long list of political undesirables. ...
   Until recently, the list was a state secret. Immigration lawyers
guessed that as many as 40,000 people were on it. ...
   The names are not holdovers from the McCarthy era; more than
two-thirds of them were put on it during the Reagan and Bush
administrations. Some 4,399 were added during the first three
months of this year alone. ...
   The widow of former Chilean President Salvador Allende was
denied permission to give a speech to an American organization that
had invited her. At various times, our government bureaucrats have
also protected us from Nobel Laureates Gabriel Garcia Marquez and
Pablo Neruda, from authors Graham Greene, Doris Lessing and Carlos
Fuentes, and from French singer and actor Yves Montand. Too bad
they can't do anything about Jesse Helms.

   Chicago Sun-Times on radar detectors:
   Now that the trucking industry has called for a federal ban on
radar detectors in interstate trucks, the radar detector lobby once
again drags out its long-discredited constitutional argument
against a ban.
   ``The government can't limit a citizen's use of a radar detector
any more than it can limit the use of an AM-FM radio,'' said an
industry flack.
   Sorry, friend, but the ``government'' can and it does. Radar
detector bans, imposed by a few courageous states not just on
trucks but on all vehicles, have been upheld by the courts.
   And not only can the government impose such bans, it clearly
ought to do it. Radar detectors are used only for one purpose _ to
break the law. And a survey found that between 33 percent and 52
percent of individual semitrailer drivers checked in a seven-state
survey used the detectors.
   The next time you're being tailgated by one of those hotshot
jockeys, you can rightly wonder about whose rights are being
violated.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on Pete Rose:
   The Pete Rose story is both sad and instructive.
   It is sad because Rose's sentencing ... on two felony tax
charges is further _ hope it is the final _ humiliation for a
sports legend.
   Rose's major league baseball record earned him a long stint in
the limelight. But now, banished from baseball and facing a
five-month prison term, he stands in the harsher light of public
scrutiny.
   It is instructive because the Rose case proves again that the
law applies to the famous as well as to those whose names never
graced a boxscore or a record book.
   By baseball standards, Rose is an oldtimer. But, at 49, he is
young enough to pay his debt to society and get his life in order.
   Pete Rose's baseball records will last a long time. So will the
image of a man who put himself above the law and now must pay the
price.

<HEAD>Three Lawyers Freed From Detention But Four Detainees Charged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government today charged four people
with plotting its overthrow. It also released three lawyers who had
been detained without charge in a crackdown on proponents of
multiparty politics.
   The U.S. Embassy welcomed the release of the three, but it
expressed hopes that other detainees would also soon be released.
``We hope the cases of those remaining in custody can be resolved
rapidly,'' said an embassy spokesman.
   Kenyan law permits detention without charge or trial of
individuals the government considers a threat to state security.
   Those charged were former detainees George Anyona and Ngotho
Kariuki, rural ruling party official Augustine Kathangu, and
university lecturer Edward Oyugi.
   The government accused them of taking part in a meeting whose
participants had ``seditious intentions of overthrowing the Kenyan
government by unlawful means.''
   Anyona, a former parliamentarian and an economist, and Kathangu,
an official of the governing Kenya African National Union in Embu,
were additionally charged with possessing seditious material.
   The four had been held without charge since July 12 when they
were arrested together at a Nairobi-area pub.
   Those released were lawyers Gitobu Imanyara, John Khaminwa and
Mohamed Ibrahim. They could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Their detentions preceded a rally planned for July 7 in favor of
a multiparty system. Police tried to block the rally, which led to
riots in Nairobi and four other cities. At least 28 people died and
scores were injured.
   Human rights lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria was threatened with
arrest during the crackdown but was sheltered by the U.S. Embassy,
which helped him safely leave Kenya.
   Still in detention are former Cabinet ministers Charles Rubia
and Kenneth Matiba, and Raila Odinga, a businessman and the son of
former Vice President Oginga Odinga.
   Rubia and Matiba were picked up by police July 4, and Odinga was
detained July 5. They are leading advocates of multiparty politics
in Kenya, which is by law a one-party state. Khaminwa represented
Rubia and Matiba and was detained when he sought information about
their whereabouts.
   Imanyara edited the Nairobi Law Monthly magazine, which served
as a platform for the advocates of political pluralism in this East
African nation.
   Ibrahim was a partner in a law firm that has represented
individuals not in favor with the authorities.
   Rubia and Matiba had been denied a state license to convene the
planned July 7 rally, but a crowd gathered anyway. Rioting began
when police armed with wooden clubs and firing tear gas canisters
dispersed the crowd.
   President Daniel arap Moi and other Kenyan leaders argue that
more than one political party in the country would lead to tribal
wars among the estimated 40 tribes.
   The government gave no reason for the lawyers' release. However,
clergymen, lawyers and foreign governments, including the United
States, had severely criticized the detentions.
   On Thursday, the International Bar Association switched the site
of its biannual convention in September from Nairobi to New York
City and cited the recent detentions as one reason.

   The Independent, Marshall, Minn., on Bart Simpson:
   Finally the uproar over poor little Bart Simpson has died down.
   Wonder if it had anything to do with school officials and
politicians checking the TV listings and noticing the huge number
of programs which share the airwaves with Bart Simpson? You know,
the ones which glorify violence, make virtually any kind of
promiscuous, deviant sex seem normal and acceptable; promote use of
drugs ranging from nicotine and alcohol up to marijuana and
cocaine; and make reckless driving seem like a good idea.
   Or perhaps it had to do with looking around at hundreds of kinds
of T-shirts which do all the above and more.
   All of a sudden Bart Simpson doesn't seem nearly the threat he
did to the younger generation.
   The Bible has some advice for folks who get all worked up over
little things like Bart, but miss the bigger problems. It mentions
something about straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.
   It does not, we hasten to add, caution people about having a cow.

   Greensboro (N.C.) News &amp; Record on UNLV sanctions:
   The basketball players of UNLV _ the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas _ have been barred from defending their 1990 national
championship in next year's NCAA tournament because of recruiting
violations in 1977, when most of them were about 7. ...
   The NCAA sanction ... writes an end to a painful episode in
college sports, a story that spans a decade of great change and
vigorous debate. One would like to think that the rules violations
committed by UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian 13 years ago are less
likely today. But who can be sure?
   In fairness to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the
long delay in this case is largely the fault of Tarkanian. After
establishing his rules violations, the NCAA tried to suspend him
from coaching for two years. Tarkanian sued in federal court to
block the action and, in 1988, won in the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The court ruled that the NCAA contract with member schools
empowered it to punish the schools, but only the schools had power
to reprimand the coaches they employ. It took 11 years to get that
far.
   Fairness also means apportioning some blame to UNLV, which
should have punished Tarkanian _ should have done so years before
he got to the Supreme Court _ but demurred. To that extent, the
university is the cause of its own current troubles.
   Nevertheless, NCAA sanctions this late in the game smack of
revenge: If Tarkanian is out of reach, then the NCAA will punish
him by penalizing his players and his school, which of course
stands to lose millions in tournament profits.
   We're all for high NCAA standards and vigorous enforcement. But
by 1990, the UNLV case had become a loser and should have been
written off to experience.

   Los Angeles Times on Soviet coal miners:
   The miners' recent 24-hour strike (in the Soviet Union) prompted
some startlingly candid reporting about their plight by state-run
television. ...
   The average Soviet coal miner can gloomily anticipate being dead
at the age of 48; Soviet men in less hazardous occupations can
expect to live to 64 years. The retirement age for miners is 55.
Only 5 percent of them survive to that age.
   It means standing a good chance of dying in a work-related
accident. Each year, about 800 miners are killed on the job. Such
appallingly high tolls are not, of course, unknown in American
history. Happily, they are a thing of the past. In 1988, U.S.
coal-mining accidents took 55 lives. ...
   Mikhail Shchadov, minister of the coal mining industry, concedes
that hundreds of miners have died because of something as simple as
a lack of timber to properly shore up mine shafts. This in a
country rich in forests! ...
   The United States has offered technical help in a number of
areas to the Soviets. ... American miners, mining unions and mining
companies have learned the hard way what can be done to reduce
hazards underground.
   A offer to apply that expertise to improve working conditions in
Soviet mines would be a true humanitarian service.

   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on Cambodia:
   The United States finally came to its senses ... and abandoned a
policy on Cambodia that in essence supported the murderous Khmer
Rouge.
   It is difficult to believe that the United States, with its
professed interest in human rights, would ever side with the likes
of the Khmer Rouge.
   Their reign of genocidal terror on Cambodia was the subject of
the movie ``The Killing Fields.'' The communist Khmer Rouge are
held responsible for more than 1 million deaths during their
three-year rule that ended when Vietnam invaded the country in 1978.
   Since then, the U.S. position has been staunchly anti-Hanoi that
American policy sided with the coalition that included the Khmer
Rouge. ... Some of the things the United States has done in the
interest of diplomacy are nothing to be proud of. Siding with the
Khmer Rouge is one of the more unconscionable ones.
   The policy change was prompted by recent intelligence reports
that the Khmer Rouge were making military gains in Cambodia. Faced
with the possibility of their full return to power, the United
States finally did the right thing.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Cambodia:
   Two cheers for the Bush administration's decision to change
American policy towards Cambodia. And the fact that this was
accomplished in consultation with Soviet Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze suggests that Asia might be one place where the United
States and Soviet Union have more interests in common than either
suspects.
   We shall see. In any case, it is refreshing to learn that U.S.
policy in the region is now concentrated on preventing a recurrence
of rule by the murderous Khmer Rouge, and not just based on
hostility to Vietnam. ...
   There is no reason why the United States cannot provide aid to
the Cambodian government, as well as the two non-communist
guerrilla factions, in order to prevent the worst possible
alternative. The real challenge for the Bush administration will be
to persuade Congress to agree.

   A strong earthquake sharply jolted the
city of Ahvaz in western Iran, but caused no loss of life or
property, Tehran radio reported Wednesday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the quake struck
Ahvaz, a city of 334,000, at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and measured 5.5 on
the Richter scale.
   A reading of 5 can cause considerable damage.
   Last month, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale hit
northern Iran, leaving 40,000 people dead, injuring 60,000 and
rendering half a million people homeless.
   More than 400 aftershocks have jolted the area since.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

   Cumhuriyet, Istanbul, Turkey, on Cambodia:
   The first positive result in Asia from the ending of the cold
war has been the U.S. withdrawal of its support of the guerrilla
coalition in Cambodia, which also included the Khmer Rouge, and its
decision to start talks with Vietnam aimed at putting an end to the
crisis.
   The reasons the U.S. administration has taken this decision
include the strong possibility of the Khmer Rouge, the country's
most effective guerrilla force, coming to power again, and the
increasing reaction in Congress against White House support of this
ruthless horde of murderers.
   The tragedy of Cambodia is an example of what could befall small
nations that happen to be located at the crossroads of big power
interests. ...
   The Bush administration, even if belately, has finally realized
the danger or has been forced to realize it as a result of
pressures from within. ...
   The U.S. has committed the greatest crimes against Cambodia. At
first the country has been bombed, then the legitimate ruler has
been removed with a coup and the scene has been prepared for the
Khmer Rouge to reappear. Even after their defeat by Vietnam, the
horde of murders of Khmer Rouge ... has been supported by
Washington. ...
   The people of Cambodia have suffered unbelievably since the coup
d'etat the United States orchestrated in 1970. Maybe this nation,
the sacrificial lamb of great power politics, deserves peace more
than any other.

   NRC Handelsblad, Rotterdam, Netherlands, on Cambodia:
   The battlefields on which the Cold War has raged are being
cleared up. In Europe the first work has been done. The Americans
are concentrating on areas where the burden of the past is still
weighing heavily upon the population.
   One of these is Cambodia, once the side stage of the Vietnam
war, then the bloody ideologic laboratory of Marxists gone berserk,
now again threatened by the Khmer Rouge. It has taken (too) long,
but the American government is currently willing to withdraw its
indirect support of the gang of assassins and to talk with Vietnam
_ the long-distance protector of the Hun Sen-regime _ about the
future of Cambodia.
   If the American swerve will eliminate the Khmer Rouge as a
factor on short term is the question. ... Initially the swerve will
especially have diplomatic consequences. The coalition of three
parties, in which the Khmer Rouge has the lead, may not count
anymore on America's recognition. ...
   The swerve in the American policy also offers a wider
perspective; normalization of the relations with Hanoi. Although
(Secretary of State) James Baker wouldn't hear of that yet, that
sort of development does seem to loom on the horizon.
   America's rather embarrassing stance in the Cambodian civil war
had everything to do with the trauma of the Vietnam war. When Hanoi
ended the terror of the Khmer Rouge in 1978, the world took a
relieved breath. But the Washington of successively (Jimmy) Carter
and (Ronald) Reagan could only see the validity of the so called
domino-theory in the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; if Saigon
fell into communist hands, then all of Indo-China and subsequently
all of Southeast Asia would be lost. ...
   The new American policy in regards to Cambodia means less
subtlety in ... contact with China. The drastic changes in the
European-Atlantic relations are starting to have an impact as far
as the Far East. Beijing shall have to take this into account.

   Business Times, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Cambodia:
   The decision by the U.S. government to open a dialogue with
Vietnam to keep the Khmer Rouge from returning to power in Cambodia
as well as withdraw its recognition of the U.N. seat held by the
Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) can be the
harbinger of a fresh ploy to break the deadlock in the 11-year-old
strife. ...
   The main reason, however, is that Washington's aid to the CGDK
has been attacked at home and abroad for helping the Khmer Rouge,
the strongest of the three component groups. ...
   But the question still is: Will the U.S. move really help
hasten, and complete, the peace process?
   Asean, the European Community and so many other countries singly
and collectively have tried over the past decade. They succeeded
only in getting the Cambodian horses to the water, but none has
managed to get them to drink. ...
   One reading of the U.S. decision is that it may force the CGDK
deeper into the arms of China which has reportedly promised to
double the U.S. assistance (amounting to about $13 million ... a
year) should this be halted. ...
   Even if the dialogue leads to greater pressure by Vietnam on Hun
Sen to make more concessions for the success of the U.N.'s efforts,
it is difficult to see the Khmer Rouge agreeing to be a party to
any settlement that ensues when it is frozen out of the process.
   The U.S. decision is clearly designed more to appease domestic
opposition to its previous stand of full support for the CGDK,
which also implied backing for the Khmer Rouge. The opening of the
dialogue with Vietnam is only a maneuver to dilute the consequences
of the about-turn in policy.

   The Times, London, on the hostages in Lebanon:
   The taking of Western hostages in Lebanon is a game of cat and
mouse. Part of the game is the regular perpetration of rumors of
release. The groups which take hostages and political allies who
hope to profit from this practice, have discovered how easy it is
to manipulate the Western media in order to sustain pressure for
ransom and thus maintain the price. ...
   A widely publicized report on July 7 led to speculation about
the freeing of Brian Keenan, the Irish-born teacher kidnapped by
Islamic extremists more than four years ago. There has never been
any word from the kidnappers themselves. ...
   The truth is that nobody but those controling the lives of the
captives knows anything about their whereabouts, state of health or
prospects of freedom. The only reliable reports about them have
come from former captives. The only way of countering this
exploitation is for the West to do an uncharacteristic thing, to
ignore any and every rumor unsubstantiated by some reasonably
reliable source. ...
   The media should adopt a self-denying ordinance, not to report
rumors, gossip and unfounded leaks about hostages, because to do so
makes it the accomplice of the world's number one enemy.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on India:
   While (India) has made impressive advance in science and
technology over the past 43 years, that progress has not been
translated into the social consciousness without which democracy is
a vicious, mindless fraud perpetrated by every voter on every other.
   There is no simple answer. Not army rule, because the army soon
starts taking after the corrupt politicians it replaces.
   Not revolution, for revolutions succeed only when they can
return countries to year zero, which they cannot.
   Certainly not a resurrected religious state belonging to a
mythical Golden Age, of the kind being offered by reactionary
parties to a confused majority community.
   Inasmuch as there is an answer, it depends on a rebirth of
nationalism, a remembrance of the romantic, but genuine national
inclusiveness that marked independence, but which was gradually
subverted by increasingly powerful vested interests.
   The problem with Indian politics is not democracy but its
degeneration.
   The solution must then lie in putting meaning back into words,
the spirit into tortured form.
   For Indians, that is no small challenge. For others, India is no
small lesson.

<HEAD>Officials Say Too Many Chinese Buried in Graves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost three-quarters of all Chinese who die are
buried in graveyards that often occupy valuable farmland, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Despite an official policy favoring cremations, about 4.5
million of the 6.5 million Chinese who die each year receive
burials, the English-language China Daily quoted sources in the
Ministry of Civil Affairs as saying.
   The Communist government has long urged the nation's estimated
1.1 billion people to abandon traditional elaborate funerals and
burials. It says burials are an extravagance for a country with 23
percent of the world's population but only 5 percent of its arable
land.
   Although most city dwellers are cremated, traditional rural
areas have long resisted the practice. In recent years, newly
affluent villagers have sought to honor the dead with large
banquets, Buddhist ceremonies and ornate burial sites.
   The problem of disposing of the dead, even those who are
cremated, has become so severe that one central Chinese city, the
scenic lake city of Hangzhou, has urged its residents to scatter
the ashes of the dead in a local river.

   The House today sustained President Bush's
veto of a bill that would require employers to provide up to 12
weeks off without pay to workers with new babies or family
emergencies.
   The vote was 232-195 to override, 53 short of the two-thirds
majority required to override.
   The action kept President Bush's veto record perfect. He has
vetoed 13 bills, and Congress has not overriden any.
   Bush vetoed the bill last month after it passed the House with
bipartisan support and passed the Senate on a voice vote.
   The president, who had voiced support for employee leave for new
mothers during the 1988 presidential campaign, said in his veto
message that the government should not require employers to offer a
certain kind of benefit.
   Supporters had acknowledged beforehand they lacked the votes to
override the veto. But sponsors pointed to polls showing widespread
support for the concept, and Democrats hoped to use the issue
against Republicans in the fall election campaigns.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said before the vote that
similar bills would be before Congress in the future. He said
Democrats would not try to pass weaker bills in a bid to win Bush's
signature.
   ``We're going to have this kind of legislation enacted, if not
this year in this session, next year or the year after. It's
inevitable,'' Foley said.
   Republicans who supported the bill criticized Bush's veto during
House debate.
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said Bush had not opposed bills that
placed other types of requirements on employers, such as are
contained in clean-air, disabilities-rights and other bills.
   ``It's beyond my understanding why the president vetoed this,''
said Roukema, the chief GOP sponsor. ``What compelling national
interest prompted this veto?''
   ``Where's our heart?'' said Rep. Arthur Ravenel, R-S.C., who
called the bill's requirement a minimum benefit and one that small
businesses weren't covered by.
   But Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, praised Bush for his
``couragous veto.'' He and other opponents charged the bill would
have imposed a ``one-size-fits-all benefit'' on all workers and
employers, regardless of whether they might prefer differing
benefits.
   Bartlett said the unpaid leave was a ``yuppie benefit, a benefit
that can only be used by upper income workers,'' while effectively
denying other potential benefits to workers because of its added
expense.
   ``The mandate before us is cruel because it denies others a
benefit that is not on the political agenda of those who sponsor
this,'' he said.
   The bill would have required business and government employers
to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid and job-protected
medical leave or with leave for the care of a new child or an ill
child, parent or spouse.
   Businesses with fewer than 50 workers, and workers who are among
the highest-paid 10 percent within a company, would have been
exempted. Employers would have been required to continue health
insurance benefits for those on leave and restore returning
employees to their previous jobs or equivalent positions.

   IBM has canceled television commercials
that were supposed to run during the Professional Golfers'
Association championship because the host club has no black
members, a company spokeswoman says.
   ``When we learned that this tournament was being played at a
club that was exclusionary, we decided it was not an appropriate
vehicle for our advertising,'' the spokeswoman, Gina Chew-Holman,
said Tuesday.
   Officials of the private club, Shoal Creek, said it does not
have a policy against blacks and some blacks have been guests. Hall
Thompson, the club's founder, said in June the club has Jews,
Lebanese, Italians and women among its members, but no blacks.
   ``Supporting even indirectly activities which are exclusionary
is against IBM's practices and policies,'' Chew-Holman said.
   Toyota and Anheuser-Busch also are canceling their TV
advertising with ESPN during the event, the Birmingham Post-Herald
reported today. Officials with the corporations and ESPN were not
immediately available to comment on the report.
   Everything was running smoothly for the Aug. 9-12 PGA
championship, also held at Shoal Creek in 1984, until Thompson
commented recently that the club would not be pressured into
accepting black members. He later apologized and said he was quoted
out of context.
   Thompson has refused to comment since his apology, as have other
club members.
   Chew-Holman would not say how much money International Business
Machines had planned to spend on television advertising during the
tournament, which will be televised for two days by ESPN and
carried by ABC for the final two days.
   Leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the
NAACP have urged picketing of the tournament.
   Mayor Richard Arrington, who is black, says he hopes black
leaders decide against demonstrations.
   ``I don't think they will be necessary to bring about the change
being sought,'' he said.
   Publicity over Shoal Creek has ``started a process of assessment
which will likely lead to the voluntary end of racial
discrimination'' in Birmingham area country clubs in a year or so,
Arrington said.

<HEAD>Bush, Congressmen Still Unable To Agree On Pentagon Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and top congressional experts
on defense compared notes today on defense spending but could not
agree how deeply the Pentagon budget should be cut in the year
ahead.
   The meeting came as Bush mounts a major effort to hold the line
on defense budget decreases in the wake of the reduced Soviet
threat in Europe and pressures to reduce the overall budget deficit.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the House Armed Services Committee
chairman, has already said he wants to stop producing B-2 bombers,
which cost $800 million each. The Air Force now has 15 of the
so-called ``stealth'' aircraft. Congress previously agreed to build
75.
   Aspin said Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ``have in mind
a much bigger defense budget than I think is going to come out of
this process.''
   He said it was impossible to ``come to grips'' with the defense
budget without knowing how much budget summit participants will
take out of defense.
   ``The process bogs down when we don't even have a defense number
for one year, never mind five years,'' Aspin said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Senate Armed Services chairman, said,
``We didn't agree on anything,'' but he said the session was
``probably the best discussion we've had on defense.''
   Nunn favors continued production of the B-2, which he said could
revolutionize warfare and force the Soviets to scrap their air
defense system if the radar-evading stealth technology proves
itself.
   Bush said last Friday at a Strategic Air Command base in
Cheyenne, Wyo., that he could live with the $18 billion the Senate
Armed Services Committee has voted to cut from his $307 billion
defense request for fiscal 1991.
   Nunn said, ``We can save some very substantial sums over five
years and do it prudently,'' trimming $180 billion to $200 billion
from defense.
   But he warned, ``If you do it over one year and you try to take
one-fifth of the total five-year savings the first year in defense,
you end up wrecking the personnel system (and) demoralizing not
only those who will be forced out of the military ... but those who
are left.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip, told
reporters that Aspin ``has the votes to pass a left-wing,
destructive defense budget.''

   An epidemic of meningitis has killed at
least 92 people during the past month in northeastern Uganda, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   New Vision newspaper said the outbreak in the arid Karamonja
region had been aggravated by a lack of medication in the area, 248
miles from Uganda's capital, Kampala.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Catholic priest as saying
that at least 42 victims, a majority of them children, were buried
in his church's cemetery.
   ``Almost every day a person is brought for burial,'' the priest
told the newspaper.
   Meningitis, a viral disease that attacks the brain and the
spinal cord, is fatal if not treated early.
   People in Karamonja, which borders Kenya in the east and Sudan
in the north, are also facing famine caused by a severe drought.

   A Virgin Islands resident testified today that
the FBI pressured him to change his story that he hadn't seen
Marion Barry use any drugs on a 1986 boat ride.
   Defense witness Albert Benjamin also told the court on
cross-examination that he became upset when he saw Barry ``make
advances'' toward a female companion on the same boat trip.
   Benjamin, a former U.S. Army sergeant, testified that he felt
pressured to tell investigators he had seen Barry and others use
drugs.
   The officers and agents questioning him ``kind of kept driving
home the point that I had to know, I had to see'' drug use,
Benjamin said.
   ``I told (one), `Mister, you pushed your luck a little too
far,''' Benjamin said he told one city police officer who had been
hovering over him during a questioning session. Both city police
and FBI agents participated in the session, Benjamin said.
   But Benjamin also said he felt disturbed seeing Barry make
advances on his female companion, Rasheeda Moore, in plain view on
a cabin atop the vessel.
   ``I was angry because I think adults should conduct themselves
in an appropriate manner in public ... my wife was sitting there,''
Benjamin said. ``I really didn't appreciate what I saw ... I felt
that was very out of place.''
   When asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts whether
Barry had been ``fondling'' Moore, Benjamin answered, `Yes, and she
accepted it.''
   Moore later became a government witness against Barry,
participating in the FBI sting operation that produced Barry's Jan.
18 arrest. Moore has testified that she and the mayor used drugs
``over 100 times.''
   Barry's attorneys called Benjamin in an attempt to dispute the
testimony of another government witness that the Benjamins could
have seen Barry use drugs during the trip.
   Benjamin said he saw no drug use, but he testified that he did
see Barry smoke a cigarette.
   Government witness Charles Lewis, who was on the trip, has
testified that he and Barry smoked marijuana on the boat.
   Benjamin said he was unfamiliar with the smell of marijuana.
   On Tuesday, Barry's chauffeur says he doesn't recall any
specific dates and details in 12 years of driving the mayor around
_ except that he didn't take him to an alleged drug pickup site on
Sept. 7, 1988.
   Testifying for the defense in Barry's drug and perjury trial,
Walter Bracey said he vividly recalled driving Barry to the grand
opening of a supermarket that morning, and then taking the mayor
directly to a meeting with city fire department officials.
   A government witness, Lydia Reid Pearson, has testified that she
handed Barry cocaine and a city job application at a municipal
building shortly after 10 a.m. that day.
   Bracey testified that he drove Barry to the supermarket opening
at about 9:40 a.m., stayed there with the mayor for 45 minutes, and
then took him to the fire department meeting.
   Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy and three felony
counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use.

<HEAD>Gephardt Says Nobody Wants to Raise Taxes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 5-7, At the White House, to add White House
views on budget session.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Budget negotiators are looking at a new 1995
target for balancing the budget, but coming up with a plan is
difficult because ``nobody wants to raise taxes,'' House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt said today.
   Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters at the White House that only
``incremental progress'' is being made in meetings with President
Bush.
   However, he said negotiators generally had agreed to a framework
under which $50 billion would be slashed from the deficit in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and a total of $500 billion over
the next five years.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-control law, which now calls for a
balanced budget in 1993, would be eased to give two additional
years to reach that goal, Gephardt said.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration and congressional Democrats had agreed to
present ``packages'' later this week that will contain specifics.
   The proposals will be presented simultaneously at budget
meetings either Thursday or Friday, Fitzwater said. That would
resolve a controversy over which side would go first.
   The proposals will be the first specific plans proposed in the
11 weeks of bargaining.
   Speaking with reporters after the second Oval Office session
this week on the budget, Gephardt said there has yet to be a single
hard decision made in 11 weeks of budget-summit talks.
   However, he also said various packages will be presented later
this week that will lay out specific options.
   Suggesting it now seems dubious that accord can be reached
before Congress begins its August recess, Gephardt said: ``If we
spend a lot of time worrying about when we'll get it done, we won't
get it done.''
   Today's White House session focused on cutting programs for the
poor and elderly, he said.
   ``Both sides are troubled'' by the magnitude of cuts being
discussed in these areas, he said. And, even though President Bush
has lifted his pledge of no new taxes, when it comes down to
specifics ``on the revenue side, nobody wants to raise taxes,'' he
said.
   Consequently, ``It's very hard to put a final package
together,'' he said.
   Gephardt, who is leader of the budget negotiators when Bush is
not present, mildly chided the president for appearing to break his
pledge to tone down partisan rhetoric.
   After agreeing to mute his political attacks against
congressional Democrats on Tuesday morning, Bush went on to lash
out at them in speeches in Philadelphia and New York City.
   Gephardt said Bush explained they had been ``pre-scheduled
speeches'' and that the president had tried to separate his
political attacks from the budget talks. ``All of us give political
speeches,'' Gephardt said. ``(But) We have to decide if we want to
make political points or solve this budget problem.''
   Gephardt said if a deal can't be struck on the budget by the
month-long August recess, negotiators may have to remain in
Washington to continue working on one.
   Negotiators say they are not likely to decide precisely what the
new taxes and spending slashes will be until September or later.
Only then will the House and Senate have a chance to vote on the
measure that emerges.
   ``The problem with putting together a detailed package now is
that it's left out there dangling'' during the recess, said Sen.
James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   ``The members when they go home are subject to pressures from
various groups'' and could end up agreeing to oppose the measure,
he said.
   Some Republicans have offered to ignore the recess and keep
working until a package is shaped, said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas.
But he agreed that what is most likely by the August break is ``the
broad outlines of a package.''
   Officials involved in the talks say White House budget chief
Richard Darman remains hopeful that a detailed package can be
completed _ and perhaps even enacted _ by early August.
   At the summit talks, now in their 11th week, bargainers failed
Tuesday to agree to the precise amount of deficit-cutting they
would seek.
   But Sasser confirmed that the ``general consensus'' of the
negotiators remained a package of about $50 billion in savings for
next year, divided about evenly between tax increases and spending
cuts. The bargainers have informally been using those numbers for
several weeks now.
   Bush complained at a GOP dinner in New York of the long
``Democratic dominance'' that he said has caused ``government by
gridlock, with spending skyrocketing out of control, good
legislation thrown aside for pork and a budget deficit looming over
our children's children.''
   He ended on a slightly kinder note, taking note of his daily
meetings with congressional leaders.
   ``We all know that the Democrats have a long track record on
spending,'' he said, ``but if the Berlin Wall could come down in
the same year that America goes nuts over the Teen-age Mutant Ninja

<HEAD>Soviets to be Allowed to Spend Foreign Currency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens with foreign currency they have
been unable to use without explaining where it came from will be
able to spend it freely at special shops and deposit it in banks
starting Aug. 1.
   The change in rules was announced Tuesday by Deputy Prime
Minister Stepan Sitarian, head of the government's foreign economic
commission, the Tass news agency said.
   As well as easing banking problems for Soviets with legal access
to foreign currency, the change will allow taxi drivers,
prostitutes, black marketeers and others with illegally obtained
cash to open foreign currency bank accounts and spend the money at
special shops currently used by foreigners.
   It also will pump much-needed hard currency, such as U.S.
dollars, into the Soviet economy. Hard currency refers to money
that is convertible on the world market. The Soviet currency, the
ruble, is not convertible.
   Sitarian said individual Soviets have $324 million in foreign
currency they had acquired legally. However, they have been unable
to spend the money in the Soviet Union except at special shops for
foreigners known as beriozkas that have only a limited amount of
goods.
   ``In accordance with the resolution, a network of trade houses
and firm-owned stores will be set up in the Soviet Union, where
Soviet enterprises and organizations, as well as citizens owning
currency, will be able to buy imported and high-quality domestic
goods,'' Tass said. It did not say when the new stores would open.
   Under the current law, a limited number of Soviets, such as
those who have worked abroad or who work for foreign firms, may
have foreign currency bank accounts. When they open the account, or
when they spend their money in the special shops for foreigners,
they must explain to the government how they obtained the funds.
   This will no longer be required, Tass said. ``This will enable
many Soviet citizens owning foreign currency to legalize it and use
it on Soviet territory,'' it said.
   Almost all Soviets are now barred from possessing foreign
currency, but many flout the law. Dozens of Soviet shoppers are
seen every weekend at joint-venture shops paying foreign currency
for imported food and goods.
   Tass quoted Sitarian as saying, ``the Soviet government is aware
of the weak sides of introducing the retail trade for currency on
Soviet territory. This can evoke protests and discontent on the
part of some layers of the Soviet population.''
   But, he said: ``Still we found it necessary to take the step and
enable state enterprises, cooperatives, collective farms and
individuals owning currency to spend it in the Soviet Union.''
   He said the currency deposits will provide a considerable sum of
foreign currency reserves for the Soviet state, which the Soviet
Union can use for its own purposes.
   The new system of stores and legalization of foreign currency
accounts ``will give the state considerable income while curtailing
foreign currency exports,'' Sitarian was quoted as saying.
   As an incentive to prospective depositers, Sitarian said the
issue of interest on foreign currency accounts will be reviewed.
Under the present rules, foreign cash accounts do not generate
interest.

<HEAD>Texas Toddler Remains In Critical Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old Texas girl was awake and alert
Wednesday, one day after receiving a liver and small intestine in a
rare transplant operation.
   Tracey Kay Gonzales of Corpus Christi remained in critical
condition in the intensive care unit at Children's Hospital here,
said spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   The toddler was being weaned off a respirator that assists her
breathing, said Ms. Cardillo. The child received the organs in a
14-hour operation that ended Tuesday morning.
   ``Doctors continue to be optimistic about Tracey's recovery,''
Ms. Cardillo said. ``At this point things are going as well as can
be expected.''
   The first 72 hours after the operation are the most critical,
and it will be at least a week before doctors will be able to
predict how she will fare, Ms. Cardillo said.
   Small intestine transplants have a poor success rate. Since
1983, one adult and three children have died within a year of their
surgeries at Pittsburgh hospitals. One adult patient is still alive.
   No patients who have received small intestine transplants
elsewhere have lived.
   Tracey needed the operation because she suffered from short gut
syndrome, which left her small intestine unable to absorb
nutrition. Her liver was damaged by a high-protein liquid she was
fed intravenously since birth.

   Tens of thousands of people mobbed Hong Kong's
Immigration Department today, the last day to apply for permission
to move to Britain and escape Communist rule when the British
colony reverts to China in 1997.
   Laborers, doctors, clerks, housewives and teachers squeezed into
a line that snaked more than half a mile over pedestrian walkways
and along two main avenues in downtown Hong Kong. At least 50
people had spent the night, and several children fainted in the
hot, humid weather.
   Immigration officials said that at least 45,000 people had
waited in line.
   By the time police closed the gates shortly after midnight,
about 18,000 heads of households had applied for the nationality
package. This was in addition to an estimated 26,000 who submitted
applications in previous days.
   ``If we don't apply, we'll lose out and become poor like all
Communists,'' said John Lam, a 41-year-old office manager in a
trading house, who had been waiting for six hours.
   ``I'm doing this for my son,'' he said, pointing to a baby
sleeping in a pink stroller.
   The British government is offering about 225,000 Hong Kong
residents the right to live in Britain. According to Hong Kong
immigration officials, about 3.5 million of Hong Kong's 5.7 million
people are eligible for consideration under the package.
   Already more than 1,000 people a week are emigrating, mainly to
Australia and Canada, because they fear a loss of rights and
opportunities when Hong Kong comes under Chinese rule in 1997.
   Mothers waiting in line today carried children strapped to their
chests. Old ladies leaned on walkers and businessmen spoke into
portable phones, cutting deals as they awaited their turn.
   C.B. Chan, assistant director of immigration, said the
department would stay open until midnight to accommodate the crowd.
   Most of those eligible for the plan don't have to formally apply
because they already can prove they are British subjects, either by
possessing a British-Hong Kong passport or a Hong Kong birth
certificate.
   Thus, thousands needlessly lined up today and the Immigration
Department issued pleas to people with the necessary documents to
go home. The confusion was another example that many Hong Kong
residents are becoming increasingly desperate about their future.
   As part of a 1984 agreement, China promised to maintain Hong
Kong's freewheeling economic and social system under a program it
calls ``one country, two systems.'' But after the June 1989
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing, many in the
territory lost faith in China's promise.
   Hong Kong people also question British assurances of its support
up until 1997, when Britain's 99-year lease on the colony runs out.
   In a sign interpreted by many as kowtowing to China, the
colonial government is prosecuting five pro-democracy activists for
breaking an obscure law banning the use of bullhorns.
   The government censored a film critical of Beijing and banned
from its waters a radio ship that was intended to broadcast
pro-democracy messages to China.
   A recent letter sent by a top official, William Ehrman, to
Chinese authorities reaffirmed Britain's policy of forbidding Hong
Kong from becoming a base for ``subversive activities,'' local
media have said.
   A sudden job switch by Britain's foreign minister with special
responsibility for Hong Kong, Francis Maude, also has caused
concern. Maude has been appointed financial secretary to the
treasury.
   ``This is a crucial stage of negotiations,'' said Martin Lee, a
member of the Hong Kong's Legislative Council and a leading
political activist. ``I hope the person replacing him will ... take
Hong Kong matters to heart.''
   Many of the people in line today said they had little hope of
leaving.
   ``It's just a shot in the dark,'' said Leung Ling-yeung, a
33-year-old teacher who took the day off from school with her
8-year-old daughter. ``My English is not too good so I don't have
much hope. But all of us will do anything to escape communism.''
   To gain consideration under the British nationality package,
applicants have to first become permanent residents of Hong Kong.
That is achieved either by birth, marriage or by living and working
in the territory for a certain number of years.
   Once they become permanent residents, they can apply for the
right to live in Britain. The British government has issued
guidelines which says it is looking for professionals in about 20
occupations, such as doctors and engineers. Fluency in English,
rare among Hong Kong Chinese, is considered important.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Gives Outlaw Groups 15 Days to Disband</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday
threatened to use military force against armed outlaw groups unless
they disband and surrender their weapons in 15 days, the Tass news
agency reported.
   The ultimatum was Gorbachev's latest effort to crack down on
increasing ethnic violence that has killed hundreds of people in
the republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and in Soviet Central Asia.
   It also was a tacit admission that Soviet Interior Ministry
troops have been unable to stop militants from organizing _ at
times with what Tass called ``the connivance of local authorities''
_ and obtaining caches of guns, ammunition, bombs and military
hardware.
   The decree also comes at a time when Gorbachev is trying to
negotiate a treaty with all 15 Soviet republics to transfer some of
the powers from the central government to local authorities who
want more autonomy from Moscow.
   The official news agency did not specify which regions
Gorbachev's decree referred to, but it followed a week of detailed
reports in the state-run press of rampages by ``terrorists'' in the
southern republic of Armenia.
   On Friday, an Interior Ministry spokesman told Tass that armed
groups in Armenia attacked at least eight government, Interior
Ministry or police offices in recent days in unsuccessful attempts
to seize weapons. The attackers used explosives in at least two of
the incidents, Tass said.
   The unofficial Interfax news agency also reported at least two
suspicious explosions last week _ one aboard a train that killed
five people and another that damaged a water pipeline to
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region disputed by Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Riots and attacks against KGB, government and party buildings
have become part of a recurring pattern of anti-Soviet violence in
various parts of the southern Soviet Union in the past year. Some
attacks are aimed clearly at taking arms from police and KGB
stocks, and others have been intended to force political change.
   In one of the biggest such attacks, Armenians bombarded the
local KGB headquarters in the republic's capital of Yerevan on
April 14 with stones, torches and flare-guns, Tass reported. One
attacker was reported killed.
   On May 4, about 200 armed men who called themselves the Armenian
National Army surrounded a Communist Party building in Yerevan for
several hours and presented a list of political demands, including
the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Armenia, before dispersing.
   At least 200 people have died in two years of ethnic fighting
between Armenians and residents of the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan, mostly over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
predominantly Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan.
   In the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, where another 212
people died in violence since June 4 between ethnic Kirghiz and
Uzbeks, Tass also reported last week that 26 firearms had been
confiscated by police and 180 people were detained. Among the
weapons seized was a grenade, Tass said.
   Gorbachev's decree authorized local police, officials of the
republics, the Interior Ministry and the KGB to take action to
ensure that all weapons were confiscated from the outlaw groups
within 15 days.
   If the armed groups do not comply with the order, ``the Soviet
Interior Ministry has the right to use Interior troops, and units
of the Soviet Defense Ministry may become involved in some
operations,'' Tass said.
   Interior Ministry and army troops have been sent to the Caucasus
and Central Asia in the past, but only after violence has broken
out. Some of these troops remain on patrol, especially along the
border between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and in western Kirghizia.
   Tass said Gorbachev's decree was aimed at outlaw groups that
threaten people's lives, seize arms, assault soldiers and police,
and attack military and civilian facilities.
   ``They are connected with the commission of other grave crimes,
and lead to casualties among innocent people,'' the agency said.
``Criminals, draft dodgers and deserters from the armed forces are
often drawn into these groups.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and President Saddam Hussein summoned the U.S. ambassador
for talks.
   Although Iraq reportedly has massed troops along the Kuwaiti
border, there were several signs today that Baghdad was prepared to
resolve the dispute.
   Diplomatic sources in Kuwait said that Saddam has given
assurances he will not use military force if Kuwait agrees to pay
compensation for $2.4 billion worth of oil Iraq claims it has
stolen since 1980.
   Later in the day, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said that
Iraq and Kuwait have agreed to hold direct talks on Saturday or
Sunday in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to try to solve their dispute
peacefuly.
   Mubarak, who has actively tried to mediate the dispute, also
told reporters in Cairo that Saddam had agreed to stop his verbal
attacks on Kuwait.
   In a show of support for Kuwait, the Pentagon announced Tuesday
that U.S. warships and aircraft would hold a ``short-notice
exercise'' 600 miles to the south in the Persian Gulf with a second
small state, the United Arab Emirates.
   Saddam moved troops to the Kuwaiti border after accusing Kuwait
and the U.A.E. of exceeding their OPEC production quotas and
driving down oil prices. He threatened to use military force if
they did not adhere to OPEC guidelines.
   At the same time, he accused Kuwait of stealing oil from the
Rumaila field, which is along the border and includes land both
countries claim.
   The Iraqi newspaper Al-Jumhuriya said today the Kuwaiti foreign
minister, Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, must ``know and his American
masters in the White House know that Iraq will not succumb and will
not let anyone encroach upon its rights.''
   In apparent reference to the heightened U.S. military
preparedness in the region, the paper accused Kuwait of
``implementing an American-Zionist plot to show that America is
playing the role of protector in the gulf.''
   The paper said Kuwait ``should be aware that those who are
threatening the interests of the Arab nation and conspire against
it will not be protected by foreigners.''
   Official Iraqi radio said that Saddam summoned U.S. Ambassador
April Glaspie for talks today. The report gave no details on what
was discussed.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt met with Kuwaiti and Iraqi
leaders on Tuesday. Arab diplomats said Saddam told Mubarak he
would not use force if Kuwait met Iraqi conditions on paying
compensation.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Saddam
also stressed that the dispute could only be solved through direct
talks with Kuwait, not through Egypt's mediation.
   Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah said today: ``Kuwait was and remains, with strong
sincerity and enthusiasm, willing to meet with our brethren in Iraq
to reach an understanding in a brotherly atmosphere on an
acceptable formula in the interest of both parties.''
   The disputed oil field extends two miles into Kuwait but Iraq
claims it owns the entire field. Kuwait wants an Arab League
committee to demarcate its borders and says Iraq has rejected the
request.
   Saddam has spent an estimated $50 billion on sophisticated arms
since coming to power in 1979 and appears to be trying to frighten
Kuwait and the U.A.E. into ending oil overproduction.
   Iraq has the world's second-largest oil reserves but endured a
costly war from 1980-88 with Iran and has a foreign debt of about
$70 billion. Saddam claims his country lost $14 billion during the
past year because of a world oil glut that has sent prices tumbling.
   Informed sources in Kuwait said the Iraqi troop buildup had
increased over the last 48 hours to at least 30,000, and that more
than 200 Soviet-made tanks were posted along Iraq's 100-mile-long
southern border with Kuwait.
   The sources said Kuwait on Tuesday reinstated a state of alert
it had declared July 16.
   Iraq has 17 million residents, including 1 million troops.
Kuwait has 1.8 million residents, and 20,300 members of the armed
forces.
   Pete Williams, a Defense Department spokesman, told reporters
that the joint U.S.-Emirates exercise, codenamed ``Ivory Justice''
began Monday.
   In Abu Dhabi, a spokesman for the United Arab Emirates Foreign
Ministry said that the Emirates holds routine military exercises
this time of year.
   ``What the American official spokesman referred to is no more
than part of a technical training program agreed upon previously
and does not have any link with the latest developments in the
region,'' the spokesman said in a statement reported by the
official WAM news agency.
   The State Department announced at the beginning of the crisis
that it backs Kuwait's territorial integrity.
   But Williams would not comment when asked if the United States
would come to Kuwait's aid militarily if it were attacked by Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Why does the endangered Houston toad cross
the road?
   For making whoopee.
   The 2- to 3-inch toads have been making the risky trip across
Texas 21 for years, and many have been flattened en route.
   The state highway department said Wednesday it has a plan to get
the toads to cross under the four-lane highway, not over it.
   For humans, the proposal is part of a roadway safety project.
For toads, it's safer sex.
   On a 5{-mile stretch of Route 21 just east of Austin, state
highway officials want to either build a series of tunnels or
modify four drainage lines for the amphibians, which cross back and
forth across the road looking for rain-swollen ponds where they
breed.
   The toad was designated a federally endangered species in 1965.
Several thousand of them live in Bastrop County, officials have
estimated.
   The toad proposals will be reviewed by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Department, which is responsible for protecting endangered
species.
   The underground toad trail is part of safety improvements where
there have been numerous instances of vehicles running into
loblolly pines that line the scenic road.
   The highway department originally proposed cutting down about
1,000 of the trees but after residents protested, officials decided
to line the stretch with guardrails and build paved shoulders.
   The state probably will choose to modify existing drainage lines
for the toads, said Randall Dillard, a highway department
spokesman. That would cost about $51,250 as opposed to $628,000 for
fancy polymer concrete tunnels designed by a British firm.
   ``I don't know if a toad really knows the difference between a
tunnel that's built for him or a modified drainage ditch,'' Dillard
said.

   Tropical storm Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane
season's first storm to get a name, today pushed heavy rain across
the Windward Islands with winds gusting to 60 mph in the Caribbean
Sea.
   Government officials on the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago
issued storm warnings for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and Grenada
dependencies. The islands separate the southeastern Caribbean Sea
from the Atlantic.
   At noon EDT, Arthur was centered about 425 miles southeast of
Ponce, Puerto Rico. It was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph
and was expected to remain on that course through Friday, said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables.
   Grenada reported 55 mph wind gusts early this morning and heavy
rains were reported on Tobago and other islands in the area, Sheets
said. The weather service reported top winds of 60 mph over open
water.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes if their sustained winds top
74 mph.
   Arthur grew from a tropical depression, the second of the 1990
season, that formed Sunday in the open Atlantic. The hurricane
season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Nina Kaufman didn't have to leave California to
get her nose pierced, her head shaved on one side and her black
hair dyed purple.
   But to get a skull and sword etched on the back of her scalp,
the 17-year-old San Rafael resident flew here for a session at
Astor Place Hair Designers in Manhattan's East Village.
   ``She said she wanted a haircut that had something to do with
death,'' said her friend, Janel Margaretta, 17, of Freehold, N.J.,
with whom she was staying. It was Janel's enthusiasm about Astor
Place that led Nina to make the trip.
   ``It's awesome,'' Janel added.
   Fred Preda, the man with the electric razor, found nothing
unusual about Nina's request, which the Terra Linda High School
student sketched on a napkin before sitting in the barber's chair.
   ``I copy anything,'' Preda explained as he showed off photos of
Union Jacks, Dick Tracy, Bart Simpson and other designs he has
razored on scalps.
   Preda is one of 100 haircutters at Astor Place, a
10,000-square-foot, two-story salon that started out as a corner
barber shop in 1965 and still has the rotating red, white and blue
pole outside.
   The store almost went belly up in the late '60s when long hair
came in and haircuts went out. But when punk rockers took over the
East Village in the late '70s and began to demand head shaves,
asymmetrical cuts, hair spiked like porcupine quills and locks dyed
pink and blue, business at Astor Place started booming and never
stopped. The walls are plastered with photos of famous customers,
from John F. Kennedy Jr. to the New Kids on the Block.
   Right now the baddest 'dos are mops on top, bald on the sides.
Popular among both sexes and all races, the fad was inspired by the
fade, a thick-on-top, tapered-on-the-side cut that started among
black teen-age boys.
   In his 1986 critically acclaimed film, ``She's Gotta Have It,''
Spike Lee as the character Mars Blackmon appears with a zig-zag
carved in his hair.
   The carved cut _ which costs $25 and up, depending on how
elaborate it is _ is easily individualized by leaving tufts of hair
in a pattern to form initials or the design of your choice.
   Hector Craveiro, 26, a Catholic school teacher from Westchester,
was having a map of Africa etched on his head.
   ``Everything's Africa now _ politics, fashion, music, names,''
he explained. ``Today was the last day of summer school at Sacred
Heart, so I decided to come down and get it cut.''
   Preda, the man with the razor, looked at a tiny plastic globe he
keeps among his combs and gels as he etched the shape of the
continent on the back of Craveiro's skull. Then he shaved away hair
to form the letters UNITY, as per Craveiro's instructions, and
colored the map in red, black and green using water-soluble markers.
   Not all Astor Place's customers are so avant garde. In one
corner, a toddler getting a trim sucked on a lollipop while his
mother looked on. Nearby, a businessman in a suit and tie read a
newspaper while the barber snipped his hair short and plain.
   Then there was Hansen Williams, 25, a hospital orderly, having
his head shaved clean except for a topknot of dreadlocks. ``I had
it dyed blonde and I like to get it touched up every week,'' he
explained.

<HEAD>Man Arrested After Hiding AIDS Test</HEAD>

   A 23-year-old man has been arrested and
charged with attempted first-degree assault because he allegedly
planned to have sex with someone without telling the person he had
tested positive for AIDS.
   Lt. Steve Imes said police were notified by an employee of a
theater about a message written on a bathroom wall, giving a phone
number and asking anyone interested in using drugs and having sex
to call.
   A detective called the number and set up a rendezvous with the
man at a hotel, Imes said. When they met and the man indicated he
was interested in having sex, the undercover detective arrested him
for vandalism for writing on the bathroom wall.
   Police then learned that the man believed he had tested
positively for AIDS, Imes said. Despite that knowledge, he
allegedly planned to go ahead with sex without telling the
undercover detective he had tested positive, Imes said.

<HEAD>CDC Study: Many Hospitals Should Offer AIDS Tests to All Patients</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT, time set by source</NOTE>

   Many hospitals should routinely offer AIDS tests
to all patients, especially in poor city neighborhoods, because so
many people are unknowingly infected with the AIDS virus, a
government study recommends.
   The chief author of the report said AIDS screening should become
as common a part of hospital care as testing for heart disease and
glaucoma.
   ``There is a large number of infected persons who are unaware of
their status,'' said Dr. Michael E. St. Louis. ``Hospitals may be
an efficient place where they could potentially get plugged into an
appropriate program of treatment or counseling.''
   His report, based on a major study by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control, found that AIDS infections are extremely common in
some poor city areas, where one in five young and middle-age men
carry the virus. But unsuspected AIDS infections occur virtually
everywhere in the United States.
   By failing to spot these infections, the study said, hospitals
are missing an important opportunity to provide early care to
people who are likely to develop grave illnesses. While there is no
cure for AIDS, treatment early in the infection can delay the start
of AIDS-related health problems.
   St. Louis said that while ideally most hospitals would offer
routine AIDS testing, the screening should be done only if they are
prepared to keep the results confidential and to offer follow-up
counseling and care to people who turn out to be infected.
   ``We are not saying that every hospital should be doing this,''
he said, ``but on the basis of our findings, many may need to
consider it.''
   While the CDC has not changed its estimate that 1 million
Americans are infected with the AIDS virus, the latest study found
a 70-fold difference in the infection rate across the United States.
   In most places, the virus is still rare. In several Midwest and
Western states, well under 1 percent of patients screened carried
the virus. By contrast, at two hospitals in New York City and
Newark, N.J., more than 5 percent of all patients were infected.
   The numbers were especially high considering that the
researchers did not test anyone who went to the hospital with any
condition that might result from the AIDS virus or suggest a
higher-than-usual risk of catching it. These included all people
with cancer, infections, hemophilia, psychiatric problems and
gunshot wounds.
   ``Our findings yield no support for the premise that the AIDS
epidemic will soon abate, even in the areas that were the earliest
infected, such as the New York metropolitan area,'' the doctors
wrote.
   Their study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was based on AIDS tests anonymously performed on 89,547
people. Their blood was drawn for other purposes at 26 hospitals
during the past two years.
   Among the findings:
   _The overall AIDS infection rate ranged from less than one-tenth
of 1 percent to nearly 8 percent, depending on the hospitals'
location. The testing turned up at least one unsuspected infection
in every hospital.
   _Men were seven times more likely than women to carry the virus,
and blacks were almost twice as likely as whites to be infected.
   _At the two New York area hospitals with the highest infections,
the virus was most common among men between ages 25 to 44. About 20
percent of them were infected.
   _At the eight hospitals with the lowest infection rates, none of
the 5,002 women tested between ages 25 and 44 carried the virus.
   Dr. Deborah J. Cotton, clinical director for AIDS at Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston, cautioned that keeping test results
confidential can be a serious problem, and often no counseling
programs exist to advise people who find they are infected.
   ``It would be wrong to offer the test if there is no place to
refer patients to if they turn out to be positive,'' she said.
   St. Louis said the CDC is revising its formal guidelines on
hospital screening to recommend more aggressive testing for the
AIDS virus.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer today vetoed a
controversial bill that would have required warning labels on
recordings that deal with potentially offensive topics such as drug
abuse, sex and violence.
   Roemer said threatened economic boycotts against the state
didn't sway him. He vetoed the bill, he said, because it was an
infringement on constitutionally protected free speech.
   He said he hoped a voluntary labeling program being implemented
by the recording industry would be successful and warned that the
issue will return in Louisiana and other states if the industry's
plan does not satisfy lawmakers.
   ``This issue will not go away,'' he said. ``As a parent, I
wanted to sign the bill.''
   Tipper Gore, president of the Parents' Music Resource Center,
appeared with Roemer at a news conference. Her group was one of the
first advocates of a voluntary labeling system.
   ``We all recognize the concern to protect children from violent
and explicit messages but we don't want government to legislate
that concern,'' said Mrs. Gore, wife of Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   Although the bill passed both chambers with more than the
two-thirds vote needed to override a veto, the Legislature is in
recess and members would have to come back into session to
override. No veto has been overridden this century.
   The bill, the first of its kind in the nation, would have
required warning labels on recordings that promote deviant sex,
violence, drug abuse, suicide or child abuse. It also would have
prohibited sale of such recordings to people under 17.
   Under the bill, retailers, manufacturers and distributors would
have been subject to jail terms and fines of up to $5,000 for
violations.
   The aim was to protect children, but the bill didn't address the
issue of having the same songs played on radio or television.
   Passage of the bill brought loud protests from the music
industry, with threats of canceled performances and bans against
groups touring in the state. The Neville Brothers, favorite sons in
Louisiana, called the bill racist. Among performers who wrote the
governor were Patti LaBelle, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Dick Clark,
Dr. John, Elton John and Judas Priest.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences had
threatened to end consideration of New Orleans as a site for the
Grammy Hall of Fame if the bill had become law. Music industry
organizations threatened to cancel planned conventions in the city.
   Radio stations had ``label day'' marathons to play nothing but
records that disc jockeys thought would fall under the ban. Among
them were such classics as ``Stagger Lee,'' ``House of the Rising
Sun,'' ``Love For Sale,'' and ``Mack the Knife.''
   In May, the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling
system that it hoped would halt state campaigns for mandatory
labeling. Industry spokesmen said every legislature except
Louisiana's pulled back labeling bills while the voluntary program
was tested.
   The legislation would not have taken effect until 1992. Haik had
said that if the recording industry implemented its voluntary
program, he would push for repeal of the law.

   A male Australian wallaby escaped from a
zoo, leaving behind three females, and has led officials on a
10-mile chase, at speeds up to 30 mph.
   Animal keepers didn't bother to continue the chase Wednesday.
Susan Stevens, a spokeswoman for the MetroParks Zoos, said rainy
weather in the Boston area meant the 30-pound marsupial, named
Aardu, probably would seek shelter.
   ``He's not likely to be visible in the rain, since he won't be
moving around much,'' Stevens said.
   Aardu, a hardy vegetarian with a knack for survival, was
probably in no danger, Stevens said.
   The chase began Monday when Aardu was reported missing from the
Stone Zoo in Stoneham. He was spotted in a nearby forest, but
bounded off when would-be captors approached.
   Stevens estimated that the wallaby had traveled 10 miles since
his escape, reaching speeds up to 30 mph.
   She said Aardu apparently leaped to freedom from his cage, which
is bounded by a moat and a high wall with a railing. He shared the
enclosure with three female wallabies, and zoo keepers had hoped he
would eventually father wallaby offspring.
   ``He can jump about 6 feet straight up, but we didn't think it
was likely he'd get out of his cage,'' Stevens said.
   Until he's caught, Aardu shouldn't have much trouble surviving
in the New England woods, Stevens said.
   ``The good news is that he's a hardy animal,'' Stevens said.
``He can adapt well to colder climates. And since he's a
vegetarian, he has plenty of food and water. He could live out
there indefinitely.''
   The question was whether human search teams could do the same.
   Stevens was one of about 25 searchers who slogged through thick
brush in the rain Tuesday.
   ``We sat there, soaking wet and tired, and we realized he's
smarter than we are,'' she said.

   A factory on the outskirts of Bangkok
collapsed Wednesday night, killing at least four people and
injuring 10, police and news reports said. Up to 30 others were
believed trapped and feared dead.
   A television report quoted the prime minister as saying the
recently completed five-story plastics factory had not been built
in line with government safety standards.
   Thai newspaper and television reporters quoted rescue officials
at the scene as saying up to 30 people were still believed trapped.
Television reports said the search for survivors would continue
through the night.
   News reports said those caught in the collapse were working
overtime. A district police officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the collapse occurred after regular working hours,
at about 7 p.m.
   Reporters at the scene said three bodies had been pulled from
the wreckage by midnight, and another person died in the hospital.
   Thailand's Channel 7 television said 10 people were taken to the
hospital, three with serious injuries.
   Late-night television showed hundreds of rescue workers clearing
rubble, using lights powered by generator because the electricity
was cut off.
   Reporters at the scene said no sound could be heard from the
collapsed building.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan arrived shortly before
midnight to view rescue efforts. He told a television interviewer
that the factory's builders had failed to meet safety standards.
   Interior Minister Banharn Silpa Archa also said the building's
construction failed to measure up to government standards.
   A factory worker told a television interviewer that the
factory's second floor gave way and the rest of the structure then
collapsed.

   Actor Paul Winfield did his homework for his role
in ``Presumed Innocent,'' according to the judge who was his role
model.
   ``He picked up that feeling of the courtroom, with lawyers going
back and forth, trying to get in evidence they know they shouldn't
get in, the exasperation you feel,'' District Judge Willie G.
Lipscomb said at a screening of the new film.
   ``Presumed Innocent,'' about a deputy prosecutor accused of
murdering a colleague, made its national debut Tuesday night at the
Detroit Institute of Arts. The movie, starring Harrison Ford, was
filmed partially in Detroit, although the book by Scott Turow was
set in a mythical Illinois city.
   Winfield observed Lipscomb's court before playing the judge in
the film.
   ``Presumed Innocent,'' which opens nationwide Friday, also stars
Raul Julia and Greta Scacchi.

   Country western singer Willie Nelson has
decided to hang a ``for sale'' sign on his $3 million, 116-acre
ranch in this mountain community west of Denver.
   ``It's a very nice estate, but very typically Willie. It's not
ostentatious; it's more on the homey side,'' broker Brad Moss of
Metro Brokers at Evergreen Inc. said Tuesday.
   Nelson is best known for his songs ``On the Road Again,'' ``My
Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys and ``You Were Always On My Mind.''
   The property, which includes a two-story, 4,700-square-foot main
residence, has been a favorite hideaway for the singer, but neither
he nor his estranged wife, Connie, has visited it for the past
several months, he said.
   The Nelsons acquired the property in late 1980 for less than
$1.5 million.
   The main house has nine rooms, Moss said.
   ``It has lots of character. It's not opulent, but it's big _ a
big country boy's home,'' Moss said.

<HEAD>GAO: Defense Management System Needs Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon must overhaul its management
system, congressional investigators said Wednesday, likening the
Defense Department's financial situation to the savings and loan
crisis and other financial disasters that have required federal
bailouts.
   The General Accounting Office said the Pentagon is planning to
build weapons the nation can't afford, operates an inventory system
with billions of dollars in excess parts and bases decisions on
incomplete information.
   ``The lack of accurate financial data for decision makers was a
critical problem in the New York City, Chrysler Corp., and savings
and loan crises,'' Charles Bowsher, the nation's comptroller
general and head of the GAO, told the House Armed Services
Committee.
   ``A similar lack of financial data exists in the Defense
Department today,'' Bowsher said.
   The federal government bailed out New York City in the mid-1970s
and the Chrysler Corp. in 1980. Ways of handling the $100 billion
savings and loan scandal are still being addressed.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., Armed Services chairman, asked Bowsher
how far he would go in comparing Defense Department management to
the nation's well-known financial disasters.
   ``In this case, you won't have the formal government bailout
because you would have bailed out on an annual basis,'' Bowsher
said referring to the nearly $300 billion defense budget Congress
approves each year.
   He added, ``Any time you push too much money into the system,
people are going to spend it. ... It's surprising in the Air Force
that the accounting was as bad as New York City, it's really bad.''
   Specifically, GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the
proposed military budget for fiscal 1990 to fiscal 1994 totals $1.5
trillion but the Pentagon's planned spending for individual
programs exceeds that amount by $100 billion.
   ``The department's five-year spending plan needs to reflect
fiscal reality and recent world events,'' Bowsher said.
   The GAO also said the Defense Department has wasted tens of
billions of dollars on weapons systems because they were not fully
tested before they were purchases. GAO cited the B-1B bomber as an
example and warned that the SSN-21 Seawolf attack submarine was
following the same path.
   The GAO also noted that as of Sept. 30, 1989, the inventory of
spare parts exceeded $109 billion of which $34 billion has been
identified by the Pentagon as more than necessary for current
requirements.
   Among its recommendations, the GAO said that in light of the
diminishing Soviet threat, the Defense Department should fully test
weapons before buying them. The agency stopped short of calling for
slowing down various weapons systems, noting that would increase
their cost. But said the department should review certain weapons.
   ``The Defense Department needs to decide which of the planned
programs it can afford,'' Bowsher said. ``Over optimistic planning
tends to obscure defense priorities and delay tough decisions and
tradeoffs.''

   Someone equipped with Ouija boards, wooden crosses
and a sense of humor played a practical joke on a team of
investigators trying to determine the cause of mysterious circles
that appear suddenly in farm fields.
   The team of engineers and photographers thought they had cracked
the mystery when sophisticated cameras and monitoring equipment
recorded flashing orange lights Tuesday night in a field they are
watching in Wiltshire.
   When the international team found two large circles with
parallel lines running through them on Wednesday morning, they were
really intrigued.
   But upon closer examination they realized they had been had.
   Ouija boards and wooden crosses were found in the center of the
circles, and the Operation Blackbird researchers were not amused.
   ``Somebody had a joke, but it has actually set our research
back,'' said Colin Andrews, a team member and the author of
``Circular Findings.''
   ``We have a serious job to do. It is only funny for 60
seconds,'' he said, adding that the recording of flashing lights
were probably thermal images of people running around in circles.
   The investigators from the United States, Japan, West Germany
and Britain had planned to spend three weeks monitoring the field
in the Vale of Pewsey in the town of Wiltshire, 75 miles southwest
of London. It was not immediately clear if the practical joke would
cause them to change their plan.
   They are trying to determine the source of the mysterious
circles, which have appeared suddenly among crops in England and
elsewhere in Europe.
   The perfectly formed circles of flattened corn _ some with
decorative patterns, some with concentric rings _ were first
recorded in England in 1678.
   In other countries, the circles have been reported in sand, snow
and rice paddies. The circles have been variously attributed to
whirlwinds, witches, magnetic forces, animals, spaceships _ and
hoaxers.
   Last year, 300 circles appeared and as many theories as to why.
   The most recent theory, published in the New Scientist magazine,
suggested they were formed by weather conditions and electrical
charges in the area.

   The Coast Guard today dismissed
charges of intoxication and misconduct against former Exxon Valdez
Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, and the skipper pleaded no contest to two
lesser charges.
   The plea agreement was revealed at the opening of a Coast Guard
hearing to determine whether Hazelwood can keep his captain's
license. The hearing continued before an administrative judge, who
will decide any sanctions.
   Administrative Law Judge Harry Gardner could dismiss the
charges, revoke Hazelwood's license or place him on probation, but
no fine or prison term can be levied.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, told the judge that
Hazelwood agreed to accept a 12-month suspension of his license but
wants to be given credit for three months because the Coast Guard
has held his license for a year.
   ``This man has suffered enough,'' Chalos told the judge. ``He's
a ship's captain. He wants to back to the sea, and he wants to go
back as soon as possible.''
   The Coast Guard dismissed a charge that Hazelwood was drunk by
Coast Guard standards while he commanded the 987-foot tanker. The
tanker hit a charted reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound, causing
the nation's worst oil spill.
   It also dismissed a charge that Hazelwood was negligent in
leaving a third mate who was not properly licensed in charge of the
Exxon Valdez as it passed through the Valdez Narrows into Prince
William Sound.
   The Coast Guard's action in dismissing the most serious charge
related to alcohol was spurred by a recent defense discovery that
Hazelwood's blood sample was mishandled and the test results may
have been wrong.
   ``We now know that the alcohol test was invalid at best and
bogus at worst,'' Chalos said at the hearing. ``This man should
never have been put through this ordeal.''
   Hazelwood entered no contest pleas to charges that he was
negligent in leaving the bridge of the tanker and that he consumed
alcohol within four hours of sailing. The Coast Guard changed the
language of one charge, removing the allegation that Hazelwood's
behavior contributed to the tanker's grounding.
   Hazelwood stood and faced the judge as he answered the remaining
charges against him in a firm voice, saying, ``No contest.''
   The alcohol charge that was dropped contended that Hazelwood had
a blood alcohol level exceeding .04, the Coast Guard standard for
intoxication, far lower than the Alaska state standard of .10.
   Hazelwood was acquitted by a Superior Court jury in Alaska of
being drunk and reckless after extensive testimony about blood
alcohol tests administered to him 10{ hours after the disaster.
There was controversy over the accuracy of the tests because of the
long delay.
   The tests showed Hazelwood had a blood alcohol reading of .06,
according to testimony.
   Hazelwood came to the Coast Guard headquarters with two lawyers
and four witnesses who had testified for him in his trial four
months ago in Alaska. The witnesses were expected to testify during
the hearing.
   Two of them are captains of ships who are expected to say that
Hazelwood's departure from the bridge during an icy crossing was
nothing unusual.
   Another witness, the tanker's radio engineer, was expected to
recount the afternoon he spent with Hazelwood in the port city of
Valdez, where Hazelwood was alleged to have drunk two or three
vodkas before boarding his ship.
   The defense contends that the charge Hazelwood drank four hours
before boarding is mitigated by the fact that the ship's sailing
time had been moved up one hour earlier than scheduled.
   The plea agreement was apparently the result of months of
negotiations between the Coast Guard and Hazelwood's lawyers,
Chalos and Thomas Russo. The lawyers said earlier they hoped
Hazelwood would be vindicated at the hearing and be able to resume
his career as a captain.
   His master's license was issued in 1966 and has been in the
possession of the Coast Guard since the Exxon Valdez accident.
   The Exxon Valdez was en route from the Alaskan port of Valdez to
Long Beach on March 24, 1989, when it struck the reef. Gashed by
jagged rocks, the tanker spilled 11 million gallons of Alaska crude
oil into Prince William Sound.
   Hazelwood was acquitted at his trial in Alaska of being drunk
and reckless, but was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of
negligent discharge of oil. He was ordered to pay $50,000
restitution and spend 1,000 hours cleaning beaches at Prince
William Sound. He is appealing.
   The 11th Coast Guard District, which includes Alaska, is
headquartered in Long Beach.

   Senators with jurisdiction over the Energy
Department's national laboratories said Wednesday the government
should keep the facilities open despite a decline in their
bomb-making mission.
   Failing to support the laboratories as they make the transition
to more civilian uses would be ``the biggest mistake in economic
history,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., at a Senate
subcommittee hearing on the future of the national laboratories.
   New Mexico is the home of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and
the Sandia National Laboratories, two of three nuclear weapons
research centers in the complex of nine department laboratories.
The other center is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California.
   The department spends $5 billion a year on developing and
testing nuclear weapons stockpiles.
   Witnesses, including Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, told the
energy research and development subcommittee the laboratories can
benefit private industry, math and science education and waste
management.
   Energy Department laboratories employ more than 16,000
researchers with advanced degrees in science and technology,
including more than 8,500 with doctorates. Fifteen Nobel prizes
have been awarded for work performed at the laboratories, he said.
More than 50 prizes have been awarded for work related to that
performed at the national laboratories, he said.
   ``No single laboratory or group of laboratories anywhere in the
country can compare with this resource or match its record of
accomplishment,'' Watkins said. ``This country cannot afford to
fritter away such a precious national asset.''
   In the last week, he said, the department has signed two
agreements with industry consortiums _ specialty metals and
advanced manufacturing _ to provide them with technology developed
in Energy Department defense programs.
   Watkins had no trouble converting the panelists, including Sens.
Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the subcommittee, and J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the full Committee on Energy
and Natural Resources.
   ``It is essential that we continue to use these laboratories to
their fullest potential,'' said Johnston.

<TEXT>
   A du Pont heir fighting a court
declaration that he is incompetent to handle his financial affairs
is being allowed to spend part of his $10 million inheritance on
his campaign for Congress.
   Chester County Common Pleas Court Judge Lawrence E. Wood on
Tuesday approved the transfer of $15,000 to the campaign fund of
Lewis du Pont Smith, a follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Smith's attorneys had sought the transfer from Wilmington (Del.)
Trust Co. to enable Smith to buy radio and newspaper
advertisements. Smith must gather 3,000 signatures on nominating
petitions by July 31 to run as an independent candidate for the
seat held by Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa.
   Wilmington Trust has monitored Smith's finances since 1985, when
Wood declared him incompetent. Smith's family had sought the
declaration after Smith gave $212,000 to LaRouche.
   Earlier this year, Smith ran ads touting his association with
LaRouche, whom he called ``the world's leading physical economist.''
   LaRouche is serving a 15-year federal sentence on conspiracy and
mail- and tax-fraud convictions stemming from political
fund-raising.
   The judge is still considering Smith's request to reverse the
incompetency order.

<TEXT>
   The fourth announced U.S. nuclear weapons
test of the year was detonated Wednesday deep beneath the surface
of the Nevada Test Site.
   The Energy Department said the test, which was not announced in
advance, was uneventful and was an apparent success.
   ``We had no problems with it,'' DOE spokesman Jim Boyer said.
   The weapon was listed as having a yield of less than 20
kilotons, and Boyer said it was in the smaller range of the
underground detonations at the nation's nuclear proving grounds.
   The warhead was detonated at 8 a.m., 1,300 feet beneath the
surface of Ranier Mesa. The site was about 90 miles northwest of
Las Vegas.
   The test was the 703rd conducted at the site since weapons
testing began there in 1951, and was the 498th test since the
Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963.
   Last year, 12 warheads were detonated there.

   South Carolina's Statehouse, which still
bears the scars of Sherman's cannons, is being shaken anew by a
three-ring scandal that involves allegations of vote buying,
drunken driving and construction payoffs.
   ``This has rocked the entire Statehouse,'' state Rep. David
Beasley said of the scandals. He said he worried that the
investigations would have ``long-term damaging effects'' on
politics in the state.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Republican heavily favored for
re-election this year, also has said he worries about his state's
image.
   ``We can't have South Carolina across the nation looking like
the way we're being painted,'' the governor said.
   The allegations have called into question the state's relatively
lax laws regulating lobbying and campaign contributions.
   ``The current laws are so permissive that people in South
Carolina feel you can do anything,'' said John Crangle, head of the
state's chapter of Common Cause, the government watchdog group.
   Two of the three investigations became public in the past week.
   First, federal officials confirmed they were looking into
allegations of illegal conduct by state lawmakers. Lawmakers say a
lobbyist, working as an undercover agent, offered legislators cash
in exchange for votes.
   Then Tuesday, sources said the U.S. Justice Department was
looking into allegations that the state's top FBI officer asked the
chief highway patrolman to help him avoid a drunken-driving charge.
   The FBI already was investigating the Highway Department on
allegations that top officials took money from a leading contractor.
   ``This is not good timing,'' Beasley said.
   The cash-for-votes investigation troubles lawmakers the most. At
the heart of it is Ron L. Cobb, a flashy, cigar-smoking former
legislator who is a well-known lobbyist.
   Cobb, some lawmakers said, offered them cash this spring when
lobbying them about a bill that would have allowed pari-mutuel
betting. A source has told The Associated Press that FBI agents
videotaped the exchanges.
   Many lawmakers and lobbyists believe the investigation is a
sting operation. Cobb's purported client, a Georgia-based
organization called The Alpha Group, does not exist, according to
Georgia or South Carolina records.
   However, neither U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel nor Fred Verinder,
the FBI's top agent in South Carolina, will elaborate about the
investigation. Cobb has not returned telephone calls to his office.
No one has been charged with a crime.
   Critics blame the investigation on South Carolina's lax rules on
lobbyists and campaign contributions.
   For example, South Carolina has no limit on corporate or
individual campaign contributions, no limits on cash donations,
little regulation on gifts from lobbyists and no pre-election
campaign finance reports.
   Twenty-seven states limit individual campaign contributions, 35
states either ban or limit corporate contributions, 26 limit cash
contributions and 15 ban or limit gifts from lobbyists. And South
Carolina is among only three states that allow candidates to wait
until after a general election to file their campaign finance
reports.
   Furthermore, the finance reports are sent to committees in the
state House and Senate, which Crangle said is ``like having the fox
watch over the henhouse.''
   Attempts at reform have died in recent years, including this
year, when the General Assembly failed to complete work on a bill
that would have required lobbyists to verify more details about
their spending.
   State Sen. Sherry Martschink said news of the investigation
actually pleases her.
   ``It should signal the end of the grim days, the end of shabby
ethics legislation,'' she said. ``The revelations bring out into
the open practices that should never have happened. Perhaps this is
indeed the beginning of the end of the sad days.''
   But it is not, apparently, the end of the scandals. Verinder,
who is investigating the legislators, is himself at the center of
allegations involving a drunken-driving cover-up.
   Government sources said on condition of anonymity that the
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility would
look into allegations that Verinder was drunk when a trooper
spotted his car weaving outside the city in late March.
   After Verinder was stopped, the sources said, he persuaded the
trooper to let him call Col. J.H. ``Red'' Lanier, the state's chief
highway patrolman. Lanier, who denies any wrongdoing, took Verinder
home. Verinder, whose office said he would not comment, was cited
only with a speeding ticket.
   ``He was drinking ... but he wasn't drunk,'' Lanier insisted.
   He also denied that his actions had anything to do with an
investigation of the Highway Department by the FBI and two other
agencies. The highway patrol is part of the Highway Department.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' Lanier said. He added that Verinder
``can't control an investigation that the state Law Enforcement
Division, the IRS and the FBI, that three agencies are doing.''
   The investigation is said to involve allegations that highway
department employees took payoffs from contractors.

   Sen. Dave Durenberger today promised his
colleagues to be ``a better man and, then, a better senator'' as
they neared a vote on a resolution denouncing him for financial
misconduct and ordering him to pay up to $123,000 in restitution.
   Ethics Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said
Durenberger ``knowingly and willfully'' violated ``the established
norms of Senate behavior.''
   ``The evidence of knowing and willful misconduct is clear and
convincing, and far more troubling than Senator Durenberger's
admitted negligence, lack of wisdom, or asserted misplaced reliance
on others,'' Heflin told the Senate.
   Every senator was expected to vote for the sanction except for
Durenberger and possibly his fellow Minnesota Republican, Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, said Lois West, Durenberger's press secretary.
   Durenberger will vote ``present'' so as not to take a position,
West said. Boschwitz may vote the same way, said his press
secretary, Tim Droogsma.
   In prepared remarks scheduled for delivery on the floor after
the vote, Durenberger called the Senate action ``an ending and a
beginning.''
   ``I ask your forgiveness,'' he said. ``For future challenges, I
need your friendship.''
   Durenberger called the experience a ``costly education'' and
assured senators, ``I have reordered my personal and professional
priorities to be, first, a better man and, then, a better senator.''
   ``As for the future, I would ask only that I be judged ... not
necessarily by what I say, but what I do. Financial restitution is
only a beginning.''
   ``There have been senators who said they would support him in
whatever he wanted them to do,'' West said. ``Durenberger, if
asked, has been saying that he would just as soon they accept it as
he has done.''
   Durenberger would be the seventh senator to be censured,
condemned or denounced in the 20th Century, the Senate's most
severe punishment for a member short of expulsion, according to
Senate historians.
   The Senate action could take as little as an hour and a half, in
contrast to what is expected to be a bitter floor fight in the
House over disciplining Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   The House ethics committee unanimously proposed reprimanding
Frank for help he gave to a male prostitute, but some Republicans
have called for censure, which would strip the congressman of a
subcommittee chairmanship, or expulsion.
   The Frank matter is scheduled to go to the House floor on
Thursday, but Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., could pre-empt
that by introducing an expulsion resolution earlier. Spokesman Paul
Mero said the conservative lawmaker was considering doing that.
   The Senate Ethics Committee last week unanimously recommended
the full Senate denounce Durenberger for ``unequivocally
unethical'' conduct in connection with a book-promotion scheme and
Senate payments on his Minneapolis condominium.
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and vice
chairman, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., were expected to take a
half-hour each to present the case against Durenberger this
afternoon, said Heflin spokesman Tom McMahon.
   Afterward, two senators were to make statements in Durenberger's
behalf and Durenberger was to make a short statement after the
vote, West said.
   She characterized Durenberger's speech as ``an acceptance of the
judgment, an apology.''
   Durenberger wrote his two-page single-spaced speech Tuesday
evening and had breakfast with a personal friend this morning
before heading to a full schedule of meetings, West said.
   ``He's really holding steady almost as if he's doing it for
everybody (staff members) around here. He's got a real positive
attitude in that's he's looking forward to having this be over
with,'' she said.
   She declined to name the senators who planned to speak in
support of Durenberger. They would not be ``arguing against the
sanction but in support of him as a senator and as a person,'' she
said.
   Durenberger had appealed to the committee for a lighter penalty,
saying denouncement was ``much too onerous.''
   Boschwitz believes Durenberger has already been punished by the
length of the 22-month-long ethics investigation and the $500,000
in legal fees he has incurred, said spokesman Droogsma.
   The resolution before the Senate said Durenberger ``brought the
Senate into dishonor and disrepute'' and lists six violations of
Senate rules:
   _A book contract that Durenberger used to collect $100,000 in
speaking fees in 1985 and 1987 over the Senate's limits on speaking
fees.
   _Real estate transactions involving his Minneapolis condominium
that he used to obtain reimbursement for staying there during trips
to Minnesota.
   _Failure to report the receipt of travel expenses in connection
with the book-promotion appearances and trips to the Boston area to
visit a marriage counselor.
   _Discussions about the condominium with the trustee of the blind
trust in which the property was held.
   _Acceptance of free limousine service during the Boston trips in
violation of Senate gift limits.
   _Conversion of a $5,000 campaign contribution to personal use.
   The ethics panel said Durenberger should reimburse the Senate
$29,050 plus interest in condominium payments and give $95,000 to
charity for exceeding speaking limits. The latter sum would be
reduced by whatever taxes he has paid on the income.

   A man who was released from prison under the
state's early release program was convicted Wednesday of first
degree murder in the deaths of two police officers in November 1988.
   Charles Street, 36, showed no emotion as the verdicts _
including several convictions for armed robbery and possession of a
firearm _ were read.
   Also in the courtroom were the families of slain Metro-Dade
officers Richard Boles, of North Lauderdale, and David
Strzalkowski, of Hollywood.
   After six weeks of testimony, the Dade County jury deliberated
just a day, rejecting the defense's argument that Streetwas
incapable of planning the murders because he was high on cocaine at
the time of the shootings.
   The officers were slain with their own guns.
   Street of Boynton Beach had confessed to the shootings. He faces
either life in prison without possibility of parole for 25 years or
death in the electric chair.
   Circuit Judge Alfonso Sepe did not immediately set a date for
sentencing.

<TEXT>
   David H. Souter's Supreme Court nomination has
escaped harsh criticism so far _ even from groups inclined to
oppose any Bush nominee _ suggesting his lack of a record on
divisive issues has insulated him from attack.
   As the nominee toured Capitol Hill to meet with senators
Wednesday, liberal groups said they hope the Senate Judiciary
Committee will closely question him during confirmation hearings in
September. But almost no one had bad words for him now.
   On the right, the only thing conservatives could find to worry
about was the possibility that Souter would prove to be other than
one of their own.
   Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of the United Conservatives of
America, said, ``Most conservatives today have nervous smiles. We
think we can be happy, but we're a little apprehensive.''
   Liberals, though hardly celebrating, were reluctant to attack
the nomination.
   Ruth Pratt of the National Abortion Rights Action League in
Souter's home state of New Hampshire said, ``The Senate needs to
find out his position on issues of privacy and choice. We are
somewhat encouraged by what we hear about his reluctance to
overturn precedent.''
   Marcus Hurn, spokesman for the New Hampshire Citizens Alliance
for Gay and Lesbian Rights, said he would testify in favor of
Souter if national gay rights groups oppose the nominee.
   ``I don't think the White House is getting a very political
judge,'' Hurn said. ``I think he is a highly judicial person
...(with) a high regard for precedents.''
   Sounding a warning _ though still not criticism _ Faye Wattleton
of Planned Parenthood said if Souter refuses to answer questions on
abortion when he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
probably in September, ``I don't think he deserves to sit on the
court.''
   Rebecca Hagelin of the conservative Concerned Women for America,
said ``We're going to see an effort by extremist feminist
organizations to bring about an abortion inquisition.''
   But she suggested that any group opposing his confirmation
because he has not endorsed the high court's 1973 ruling legalizing
abortion runs the risk of being branded extremist.
   Both liberal and conservative groups have acknowledged the
president caught them off guard by picking a successor to William
J. Brennan within three days of the Supreme Court justice's
retirement announcement.
   By moving quickly and choosing someone apparently
non-controversial, Bush has accomplished the dual purpose of
short-circuiting a possible drive by opposing groups to influence
the selection and enhancing confirmation prospects.
   The White House made no secret of its intentions.
   ``We saw that some of the special interests _ on abortion, civil
rights _ were going to try to cook up a stew that this nomination
would get dumped into,'' said presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Conservative activist Pat McGuigan said, ``Nobody knows anything
about him. In terms of Senate confirmation, this is very helpful.''
   But McGuigan said there could be political trouble down the road
for Bush if Souter proves to be something other than a reliably
conservative vote as a justice.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents,
worried about their future after China's takeover in 1997, flooded
the Immigration Department Wednesday, the last day to apply for a
special plan to emigrate to Britain.
   More than 18,000 heads of households submitted applications for
the nationality package by 12:30 a.m. Thursday when police clanged
shut a portable gate 30 minutes after the scheduled deadline.
   At least 45,000 people, including children and other dependents,
waited in line throughout the day and no one appeared to have been
turned away, immigration officials said.
   The British nationality package will grant full British
citizenship to 50,000 families, or about 225,000 Hong Kong
residents.
   Hong Kong is scheduled to return to Chinese control in 1997,
ending 99 years of British colonial rule. More than 1,000 people a
week are emigrating from Hong Kong, mainly to Australia and Canada.
   Emigration this year is expected to increase at least 30 percent
over last year when more than 42,000 people left.
   According to Hong Kong immigration officials, about 3.5 million
of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people are eligible for the British
plan. But less than 10 percent will win the right of abode.
   Britain offered the plan in an attempt to stop Hong Kong's most
skilled people from fleeing the territory as the date for the
Chinese takeover draws near.
   China opposes the British emigration plan and has threatened not
to acknowledge the British passports of Hong Kong residents.
   On Wednesday, people were packed 12 deep in some places outside
the Immigration Department.
   The line snaked for almost a mile over walkways and along
avenues from morning until late in the night. About 50 people spent
Tuesday night sleeping on an overpass and dozens of people fainted
in the humidity and heat.
   A woman wearing a sleeveless green T-shirt was the last
applicant.
   ``I just want to be apply quietly,'' she pleaded in broken
English as news photographers surrounded her. ``Apply quietly for
Britain.''
   As the clocked ticked toward midnight, women ran, clutching
their babies, fathers sprinted with strollers and young toughs cut
in line with an elbow in the face.
   ``If I don't get out of Hong Kong by 1997 I'm finished, I know
it,'' said Li Qiang, a 42-year-old laborer who fled Communist China
to Hong Kong during China's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. ``I
hate the Communists and I'm afraid they want to get me.''
   Li was waiting with his wife and 11-year-old daughter who was
dressed in ribbons and bows.
   ``I want to impress the officers,'' he said. ``Do you think it
will work?''
   During the day, thousands unfurled umbrellas to counter the
withering sun. Businessmen whispered into portable phones, cutting
deals as they awaited their turn.
   Most of those eligible don't have to formally apply, like people
were doing Wednesday, because they already can prove they are
British subjects, either by possessing a British-Hong Kong passport
or a Hong Kong birth certificate.
   Immigration officials said thousands of people needlessly lined
up.
   The confusion was a further indication of the growing fear Hong
Kong residents have of the impending Chinese control.
   Charles Lai, a 45-year-old tax consultant, said he heard on the
news that it was the last day to apply so ``we got the whole
building to apply.'
   ``We figured first apply and then worry about our chances. It's
like gambling,'' said Lai, who led a group of about 270 residents
from an apartment house in Kowloon.
   Hong Kong residents also questioned Britain's support for the
colony.
   Over the past few months, the Hong Kong government appears to
have bowed to Chinese pressure to limit political discourse. It has
prosecuted political activists, censored a film on China's
democracy movement and started random identification checks during
pro-democracy rallies.
   At the Immigration Department, many people said they had little
hope of leaving the territory.
   ``I'm doing this for my son,'' said John Lam, a 41-year-old
office manager at a trading house. Next to him a baby slept
peacefully in a pink stroller.

   A longtime aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo was
charged Wednesday with assault for allegedly throwing a plate at a
lawyer during a weekend dinner party, police said.
   John Iaccio was charged with third-degree assault on a complaint
filed by Jonathan Wehle, said Officer Jerry Yerbury of the police
department of Guilderland, the suburb where the party took place at
the home of another Cuomo aide.
   Wehle, a special counsel in the enforcement division of the New
York Stock Exchange, was treated for a gash near his eye after the
Saturday night episode.
   Iaccio did not report for work and no one at his home answered
the phone. His lawyer, Stephen Coffey, refused to comment about the
case.
   Wehle also did not answer telephone calls Wednesday. He told the
Albany Times Union that Iaccio flipped the plate across a table at
him.
   ``This guy did it in front of about 12, 13 people, and it was
totally unprovoked,'' Wehle said. ``The words he said to me
immediately afterwards and the words that I heard he said to the
group when he left make me ... extremely angry.''
   Neither police nor Wehle said what Iaccio was angry about. ``It
was a misunderstanding, I believe, that set it off,'' Yerbury said.
   Iaccio surrendered Wednesday after being contacted by police,
said Yerbury. He was released without bail. An arraignment was set
for Aug. 9.
   Cuomo said Iaccio, a special assistant who frequently travels
with the governor, had requested and was granted some time off.
   ``I don't know anything about the event. I know it was a dinner
party,'' said Cuomo.

<HEAD>Aerospace Executive To Head Independent NASA Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration named a veteran
aerospace executive Wednesday to head an independent committee that
will review NASA's plans for the future of the nation's space
program.
   The committee, under chairman Norman R. Augustine, will report
its findings in four months. Its mandate is to look into all phases
of the space program and make recommendations for alternate
approaches when appropriate.
   Augustine has been chairman and chief executive officer of the
Martin Marietta Corp., which builds the Titan series of rockets
among its many space-related activities.
   Augustine was the only appointee named in an announcement by
Vice President Dan Quayle, who is head of the National Space
Council. The announcement said Augustine was recommended by Richard
H. Truly, the administrator of National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The committee was formed because of a behind-the-scenes struggle
between NASA and the National Space Council over control of the
space program. Quayle and the council have sought to persuade NASA
to seek alternate approaches to a number of major projects,
including President Bush's plan to establish a manned base on the
moon and send an expedition to Mars.
   ``Nothing is off the table, this is a top-to-bottom review of
the space program,'' said a source from the vice president's side,
who asked not to be identified.
   The announcement, however, sought to make clear that Truly was
not relinquishing his responsibility to run the space agency.
Reports in Washington were that Truly had threatened to resign if
another authority was imposed on him.
   Truly is a former astronaut who was brought back from the Navy
to run the manned space program after the fatal Challenger accident
in January 1986.
   ``The committee will operate as an independent entity, reporting
to the administrator of NASA, and will submit its findings to the
administrator of NASA and, with the administrator, to the vice
president,'' it said.
   The committee is to review the future of the civil space
program, including both management issues and program content.
   Its members, according to the announcement, will review
appropriateness of planned activities, organizational balance and
structure, adequacy of skills, balance between roles of government
and the private sector, possible contributions by other government
agencies, the need to maintain a strong research and development
capability, and assurance that missions can be carried out
successfully.
   The committee members will be ``individuals selected for their
knowledge of space activities and management expertise,'' the
announcement said.
   Augustine's career includes both private and government posts,
including under secretary of the Army. He received the
distinguished service medal, the highest civilian decoration of the
Defense Department, four times.

   Iraq and Kuwait have never agreed on the demarcation of their
border since Kuwait gained its independence from Britain in 1961.
   Shortly after Kuwait gained its independendence, Iraq claimed
sovereignty and the Kuwaitis asked Britain for assistance. Britain
sent in paratroopers and they were replaced by an Arab force led by
Egypt, which acted as a buffer between the two countries until
tensions eased in 1963.
   Iraq reportedly has sent thousands of troops to its
100-mile-long southern border with Kuwait, although Iraq has denied
building up troops along the border.
   Here is a brief chronology at the events of this dispute:
   July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices
down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf of
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup.
   July 18 _ Iraq acccuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking
to wreck the country's economy by overproducing oil and thus
pushing down prices.
   July 19 _ Kuwait cancels a state of alert it declared in an oil
dispute with Iraq.
   July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials and diplomats suggest Iraq's sudden
outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _
including Kuwait _ to write off billions of dollars in debts from
the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
   July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft were holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
south of the Kuwait-Iraq dispute.
   July 24 _ Kuwait reinstates a state of alert it declared July 16
and canceled after three days of tension between the two
oil-producing countries.
   July 25 _ The Iraqi government in Baghdad said that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddam summoned the U.S. ambassador for talks.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet
in Saudi Arabia this weekend in an effort to resolve their dispute.

<HEAD>Jury Seated in Contra Mercenary Suit Against Secord, Southern Air</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury was selected Wednesday to decide a lawsuit
that blames retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord and a
CIA-linked airline for the 1986 plane crash in Nicaragua that
helped unravel the Iran-Contra affair.
   Cargo handler Eugene Hasenfus and the family of the plane's
co-pilot, Wallace Sawyer Jr., claim in the lawsuit that Secord and
Miami-based Southern Air Transport used unsafe aircraft in the
Nicaraguan Contra supply effort.
   The October 1986 downing of the C-123 by a Sandinista rocket
helped trigger the Iran-Contra investigation. After the crash, the
Reagan administration acknowledged that money was diverted from
Iran arms sales to the Contras, despite a congressional ban on U.S.
military aid to the rebels.
   A six-member jury and two alternates were seated after
questioning by senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins. Only a
few of the 35 prospective jurors said they remembered reading or
hearing about the crash. None showed any recognition when former
White House aide Oliver North was mentioned as a possible witness.
   Secord sat at the defense table with Southern Air President
William Langton and a team of lawyers. Hasenfus, of Marinette,
Wis., sat across the room with his wife, Sally; Sawyer's widow,
Kasanee Sawyer, of Magnolia, Ark.; and their attorneys.
   Secord pleaded guilty Nov. 8 to lying to the congressional
committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair and has been placed
on two years' probation.
   When the lawsuit was filed in 1988, attorneys had estimated
damages at $135 million. However, on Wednesday the plaintiffs
submitted new figures seeking actual damages of about $2 million
for Sawyer's family and about $1 million for Hasenfus.
   Hasenfus, a cargo handler, or ``kicker,'' aboard a plane
secretly supplying the Nicaraguan rebels, was captured and held for
about three months after Nicaraguan troops shot down the plane.
   The lawsuit says Hasenfus was recruited in 1986 through the
Pennsylvania airline Corporate Air Services and William Cooper, a
pilot for Southern Air, which was once owned by the CIA and
continues to do contract work for the U.S. government.
   Cooper, who also died in the crash, led Hasenfus to believe he
was working on behalf of the U.S. government on a project being
directed ``right out of the back door of the White House,'' the
lawsuit said.
   Southern Air has denied any association with the Hasenfus flight.
   Secord's attorneys describe Hasenfus as a mercenary, paid about
$3,000 a month, who knew the risks.

   President Bush will attend a 35-country United
Nations ``world summit for children'' in New York on Sept. 30, the
White House announced Wednesday.
   The following day, he will deliver his annual address to the
U.N. General Assembly, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney of Canada and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan will chair the summit meeting.
   World leaders at the two-day event are expected to discuss
``making progress in the struggle to save young people vulnerable
to hunger and disease,'' Fitzwater said.
   The event could turn into a major gathering of world leaders.
   Fitzwater said the White House has not ``received any word'' on
whether Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will attend.

<HEAD>Imelda Offers $5 Million for Philippines Earthquake Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos would donate about $5 million for
earthquake relief in the Philippines if the Manila government and
U.S. officials release funds frozen by the courts, her lawyer said
Wednesday.
   James Linn, an Oklahoma City attorney representing the former
Philippine first lady, said the offer was made several days ago and
``we're waiting for an answer from Manila.''
   Tambi Wycoco, a spokesman for the Philippines Consulate here,
said he'd heard ``rumors'' of the offer ``but we've seen nothing on
it.''
   ``Of course if she offered ... it would be accepted,'' he said.
``There are some in the community who say it would be her way of
returning the money. Later she can say she gave back $5 million.''
   Linn said Mrs. Marcos spoke by telephone with Vice President
Salvador Laurel in Manila about the proposed donation.
   Laurel has split politically with President Corazon Aquino, with
whom he rose to power in the February 1986 popular revolt that
ousted Mrs. Marcos' husband, the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The proposed donation, of 100 million Philippine pesos, would
require the approval of Mrs. Aquino's government and a U.S. court,
which froze the Marcoses' assets after they were driven into
Hawaiian exile.
   Philippines officials said on Wednesday that the toll now stands
at more than 1,600 killed, 3,000 injured and 90,000 left homeless
by the quake that struck the northern main island of Luzon a week
ago.
   The disaster has created another financial crisis for the Aquino
government, already burdened by a $26 billion foreign debt.
   Linn said Mrs. Marcos' offer was ``just a humanitarian gesture,
with no strings attached.''
   Some of the Marcos assets frozen by the 1986 court order are in
Swiss banks and some in Hong Kong, said Linn. He would not estimate
how much money was involved.
   He said the request for a court order releasing the funds would
be put to U.S. officials later this week.
   Mrs. Marcos was acquitted here earlier this month of federal
fraud, racketeering and obstruction charges in the alleged theft of
more than $220 million from the Philippines treasury during Marcos'
20-year rule.
   Still pending are a series of civil lawsuits filed by the Aquino
government, which is still trying to recover the money.
   In addition, the 61-year-old Mrs. Marcos has been subpoenaed to
testify before a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh investigating
dealings between the Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Marcos
concerning a nuclear power plant the company built in the
Philippines in the early 1980s.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has
named an aide, Kelly Shipp, as head of public affairs in the
Agriculture Department.
   Shipp, 30, has been his press secretary since Yeutter joined
USDA in early 1989. Before that, she was Yeutter's spokeswoman when
he was U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration.
   ``Kelly is extraordinarily capable,'' Yeutter said Wednesday in
a statement. ``Her knowledge of (USDA), media relations and
international trade issues will be a tremendous asset to our public
affairs division.''
   Yeutter said Shipp will continue to be his chief spokeswoman in
her new job and will report directly to him.
   Shipp grew up on an Alexis, Ill., farm, which her parents still
operate. She also worked at USDA and on Capitol Hill before joining
Yeutter.
   The new assignment pays Shipp $71,200 a year, her office said.
She succeeds Paul Kindinger, whose resignation was announced on
Monday. He will teach agriculture at the Pentagon's war college
here.

<HEAD>Report Sets Timetable for Developing High-Speed Magnetic Train</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agencies studying the feasibility of
high-speed trains propelled by magnets should know by 1993 whether
the United States can regain the lead in this transportation
technology, said a report released Wednesday.
   The report _ a ``Preliminary Implementation Plan'' developed by
the Army Corps of Engineers _ sets a timetable under which various
federal agencies would evaluate and then oversee the development of
magnetic levitation trains in the United States.
   ``We believe there is a golden opportunity for magnetic
levitation in this country,'' said Dan Mauldin, deputy director of
civil works for the Corps of Engineers.
   Magnetic levitation trains are propelled by magnets on a cushion
of air over a rail. Such trains could travel up to 300 miles per
hour, use less energy than conventional means of transportation and
would be cheaper to ride than airplanes, according to the report.
   So far, only the Japanese and the Germans have developed
prototype trains. Several projects are under discussion in the
United States.
   In fiscal 1993, the federal agencies studying magnetic
levitation _ which include the Transportation Department, the
Federal Railroad Administration and the corps _ will choose from
among three options, according to the report.
   The agencies may ask one or more industry teams to design an
advanced magnetic levitation system. The ``winning'' team would
then have the opportunity to build and operate a full-scale
prototype.
   The agencies may encourage U.S. industry to team with state and
local interests to build several different magnetic levitation
systems at different sites. The market would then determine which
system is superior based on operation, maintenance and costs.
   The agencies may encourage private-sector firms to adapt foreign
magnetic levitation systems for U.S. transportation needs. The last
option would require the smallest outlay of federal money, the
report noted.
   Magnetic levitation was invented and pioneered in the 1960s and
1970s by Americans, including James Powell and Gordon Danby at
Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. But U.S. advances
stopped around 1974, when the federal role in magnetic levitation
development ended, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan said at a news
conference to release the report.

   A shooting victim declared dead for
hours suddenly showed signs of life as medical technicians were
preparing his body to remove organs for transplants.
   He died Wednesday, nearly 15 hours later.
   ``This is the first time I've seen one respond like this, and
I've been at this for 30 some years,'' said Black Hawk County
Medical Examiner Albert Dolan.
   He said a medical team that hoped to take organs for transplant
from the body of James Albert Geiger of Waterloo stood aside
Tuesday as doctors, who initially believed that Geiger had died
eight hours before, worked to save his life. Geiger then died early
Wednesday morning.
   Geiger, carrying a six-inch knife and threatening suicide, was
shot late Monday, police said, when he lunged from beneath a table
at his home in Waterloo toward a police officer. A .357-caliber
bullet entered the top of his head and came to rest at the base of
his brain, Dolan said.
   Geiger was declared brain dead early Tuesday.
   The medical examiner said a blood flow test was administered to
determine if blood was reaching Geiger's brain.
   ``It's 90 percent accurate. When there's no flow, you consider
the patient brain dead,'' Dolan said. ``That was what we found
early on Tuesday, therefore he was given the diagnosis of brain
dead. And you have to remember, there was severe trauma to the
brain.''
   Doctors got permission from Geiger's family to take the organs
for transplants. But about 7{ hours after Geiger was pronounced
brain dead, a cardiologist who was there to maintain Geiger's blood
pressure was startled by an arm movement that would not happen if
the patient were dead.
   ``We were all shocked. He indicated he had some response to
pain, which normally a brain dead person would not,'' Dolan said.
   Another test showed the brain was marginally active, and Geiger
was declared to be alive but very critical, Dolan said.
   In the next several hours, Geiger's blood pressure dropped,
causing damage to his organs that made them unsuitable for
transplant, Dolan said. Geiger died of heart failure early
Wednesday morning.
   ``My own answer to this is that God just wasn't ready for him
yet, that's the only explanation I can give. Unfortunately,
medicine is not an exact science,'' Dolan said.
   The Waterloo Police Department is conducting an investigation
and, at the chief's request, the Black Hawk County Sheriff's
Department and Iowaservices committees to press ahead with
production of the B-2 bomber and other major new weapons. The House
is considering halting production of radar-evading jets, which cost
$800 million apiece.
   The defense session came on the heels of another meeting between
Bush and the five top leaders of Congress to push the budget summit
talks along.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that at either
Thursday's or Friday's meeting, both sides will ``simultaneously''
put proposals on the table for cutting $50 billion from the deficit
next year and $500 billion over five years.
   But Democratic budget bargainers disputed that, saying no
decision had been made on exchanging offers.
   ``That is so silly,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters
the two sides have tentatively agreed to extend from 1993 to 1995
the Gramm-Rudman deadline for balancing the budget.
   Gephardt said major differences in defense levels is a major
hang-up in reaching an overall budget compromise.
   Bush and the leaders discussed entitlement programs _ Social
Security, Medicare and other programs for the poor and elderly _
and ``both sides are troubled'' by the magnitude of cuts that might
be needed in those areas, Gephardt said.
   Despite Bush's earlier agreement that the government must pull
in more tax revenues, ``nobody wants to raise taxes. ... It's very
hard to put the final package together,'' the Democratic leader
said.
   After the defense session, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the House
Armed Services Committee chairman, lamented that Bush and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney still ``have in mind a much bigger defense
budget than I think is going to come out of this process.''
   Aspin announced Monday he favors halting production of the B-2
now that the first 15 bombers have been delivered to the Air Force.
Bush wants to build the fleet of 75 that Congress agreed to several
years ago.
   Aspin's Senate counterpart, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who favors
continued production, said afterwards, the B-2 ``has an uphill
fight if it's going to survive.''
   Aspin's committee is aiming to cut $24 billion from Bush's
request for $307 billion for the Pentagon for fiscal 1991.
   Fitzwater said Bush called the meeting to express concern about
``inordinate cuts.''
   Despite improved relations, the Soviet Union remains the United
States' adversary, said Fitzwater. He quoted Bush as saying,
``There have been few changes in Soviet strategic forces. ... They
are continuing to modernize their entire force, and will enter the
START negotiations fully modernized.''
   Cheney told the lawmakers that the House cuts would force the
Pentagon to absorb personnel cuts of 250,000 in the first year,
cutting back nearly four army divisions and 25 ships.
   ``We think that is unreasonable,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush said at a Strategic Air Command base in Cheyenne, Wyo.,
last Friday that he wanted ``to hold the line at the already
painful reduction of the defense budget set down by the Senate
Armed Services Committee.''
   That panel, chaired by Nunn, approved a $289 billion defense
bill last week that would cut nearly $1 billion from Bush's $4
billion Strategic Defense Initiative request and remove 100,000
troops from active duty, including 50,000 from Europe.
   Nunn said after the meeting, ``We can save some very substantial
sums over five years and do it prudently,'' trimming $180 billion
to $200 billion from defense.
   ``The first year we can save about 20 percent responsibly. ...''
Nunn said. ``Over five years we can save about 35 percent of that
total of $500 billion.''
   But if too much is cut the first year, ``you end up wrecking the
personnel system (and) demoralizing not only those who will be
forced out of the military ... but those who are left,'' Nunn
warned.
   Nunn said it will take strenuous efforts by Bush, Cheney and
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to save the B-2.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip, told
reporters afterwards that Aspin ``has the votes to pass a left
wing, destructive defense budget.''
   ``That bill will either be fixed in conference or it will be
vetoed,'' Gingrich said. ``What they're going to do in their markup
is going to be a massacre, not a markup.''

   A change in Cambodia's representation
in the United Nations would hurt the search for peace in Indochina,
the Association of Southeast Asian nations said in a statement
Wednesday.
   Last week, the United States withdrew its support for the
tripartite guerrilla coalition that holds Cambodia's U.N. General
Assembly seat.
   In a communique, ASEAN foreign ministers said any change ``would
set back the search for a comprehensive political solution to the
Cambodian problem.''
   The communique was mild in tone and did not mention the United
States by name.
   Washington also announced last week it would open talks with
Vietnam on a settlement in Cambodian and would no longer support
the right of the guerrilla coalition to represent Phnom Penh in the
world body.
   Those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement
between the United States and Hanoi, shifting the balance of power
in Southeast Asia. Hanoi supports the Cambodian govenment.
   The abrupt U.S. policy change underlined the failure of years of
ASEAN-led diplomacy to negotiate a settlement. ASEAN helped form
the Cambodian resistance group in 1982.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the shift was
designed to prevent the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three
guerrilla groups, from gaining power in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge
took power in 1975 and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of
civilians before it was ousted by Vietnam in 1978.
   ASEAN officials plan to meet Baker and foreign policy
specialists from Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the
European Community later in the week.
   The communique also called for the resumption of the
inconclusive Cambodian peace talks. It ``noted with regret that the
conflicting parties themselves so far have not sufficiently shown
the necessary political will for a negotiated settlement.''
   The statement said ASEAN hopes that a ``Supreme National
Council'' representing the three guerrilla factions and the
Cambodian government will administer Cambodia.
   The guerrilla coalition is comprised of the communist Khmer
Rouge, the non-communist forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son
Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   ASEAN diplomats also said the U.S. switch could lower the
incentive for the Khme271 million in the first three months of this
year, a worse showing than in the same period a year ago but a
sharp improvement over the previous quarter.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said the
red ink compared with a $3.1 billion loss in the fourth quarter of
1989 and a $10 million profit in the first quarter of 1989.
   The figures do not include 350 thrifts which were still open at
the end of March but were controlled by the Resolution Trust Corp.,
a new agency charged with closing and selling failed S&amp;Ls. The
corporation is expected to release those figures next week.
   Analysts complained that reporting profit results separately for
private and government-controlled thrifts amounts to sugar-coating
bad news and interferes with their ability to analyze the entire
industry. The thrift office collects information from both sets of
S&amp;Ls and in the past had always released both groups of figures.
   ``It's hogwash,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions
analyst in Alexandria, Va. The thrift office ``wants to be the
good-news boys.''
   However, thrift office director Timothy Ryan declared, ``I'm not
... Mr Rosy Scenario.
   ``Putting the two together presents an inaccurate picture of the
industry,'' he said.
   The agency also is drawing criticism from Congress. Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House Banking task force that
monitors the S&amp;L bailout, said in a letter to Ryan that there is
``no rational basis'' for separating the statistics.
   ``The American people are skeptical of the good faith of the
regulators and of the savings and loan industry, and frankly this
change in reporting ... looks bad,'' Vento wrote.
   In Wednesday's report, the thrift office did not say how much
the losses were reduced by government subsidies to S&amp;Ls bailed out
in 1988. Ely estimated the subsidy at between $1 billion and $1.5
billion per quarter.
   The 1988 deals are coming under increasing criticism from Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and others in Congress who say they
provided acquirers with virtually guaranteed profits for very
little investment.
   The agency said deposits at thrifts privately run at the end of
March increased to $798 billion from $789 billion a year earlier.
   However, the figure includes interest paid on the deposits,
which would have been about six times the $9 billion gain.
Normally, economists subtract the interest to get an idea of
whether S&amp;L customers are withdrawing more than they are depositing.
   Also, the figures excluded deposits lost at S&amp;Ls that were
turned over the the RTC at some point during the year.
   Ryan, in a press release issued by his agency, had greeted the
first quarter results as a sign of progress. He was quoted as
saying, ``It appears that deposits and profits are returning to the
strong part of the industry.''
   However, at a news conference, he told reporters it was too soon
to draw conclusions from the data. He said he would not know if the
industry is capable of surviving until sometime early next year.
   ``Should we jump up and down and declare victory?'' he asked.
``No. This is still a very tough situation, in my view.''
   The agency divided the S&amp;L industry into four parts: 310
institutions expected to fail, 311 struggling thrifts that may
fail, 620 S&amp;Ls that are somewhat weak but are expected to survive
and 1,264 institutions in good shape.
   Only the institutions in the last group earned what investors
consider an acceptable return, $692 million. The next best group
earned a subpar $192 million. The struggling S&amp;Ls lost $281 million
and the expected failures lost $874 million.
   ``You have an enormous segment of the industry that isn't making
it,'' Ely said.
   Wednesday's report was about a month late. Ryan said the agency
had changed its data collection process and hoped to release the
reports on time in the future.

<HEAD>Boesak Quits Church Posts, to Maintain Extramarital Relationship</HEAD>

   Anti-apartheid leader Allan
Boesak, tainted by a scandal over his extramarital affair, said
Wednesday he was resigning all his church posts to seek a political
career.
   The mixed-race Protestant minister also said he would continue
his relationship with Elna Botha, a married, white producer for
government-run television.
   Boesak, the father of four children, said his wife, Dorothy, had
initiated divorce proceedings.
   He and Ms. Botha issued simultaneous statements through their
attorneys, saying their marriages had begun to fail before they met
each other and that they intended to maintain their contact.
   Church officials had pleaded with Boesak to reconsider when he
announced July 8 he would resign from his religious posts.
   He said Wednesday he would not change his mind and had stepped
down as a minister of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church and
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, an
international council of Protestant churches.
   ``I have ... decided to offer my services to the people of this
country to bring about a united, non-racial and democratic South
Africa. I am prepared to play any role which I may be called upon
to play in this regard,'' he said in a statement released by his
lawyer.
   Boesak has played a major role in the opposition to apartheid,
leading demonstrations and touring the world to denounce South
Africa's system of racial segregation.
   Long thought to be interested in a political career, Boesak
models himself after the late Martin Luther King Jr.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who often marched with Boesak
at the head of protests against apartheid, said Wednesday ``the sky
is the limit'' for Boesak's future political career. ``People
recognize his gifts, the sacrifices that he has made for the
struggle, and I think thay they will follow him.
   ``He has fought a very great deal and his family has,'' Tutu
said. ``Perhaps part of the cost is what has happened to his
marriage.''
   The revelations about Boesak and Ms. Botha were seen as a moral
scandal in South Africa because both were married and Boesak was an
ordained minister. Apartheid laws on inter-racial relationships
were dropped in 1985.
   Boesak came under fire in the mid-1980s following press reports
of his involvement with a white female church worker. A church
inquiry later cleared him of any wrongdoing.

   An Army helicopter on which the crew
had been using night-vision goggles crashed during a night exercise
at Fort Campbell, killing two soldiers and injuring three,
officials said Wednesday.
   The CH-47D Chinook medium-lift helicopter, which can carry loads
suspended in slings, was on a training mission when it crashed late
Tuesday.
   The soldiers were training with a load of two concrete blocks
slung beneath the copter when it crashed, said Sgt. Steven
Sanderson, a post spokesman. He did not know how much the blocks
weighed.
   All that remained of the Chinook on Wednesday was charred
wreckage. It was not known if the helicopter caught fire in flight
or burned after crashing, said Bill Harralson, a deputy post public
relations officer.
   Night-vision goggles, which enhance available light, were used
on the flight, said Harralson. He did not know if they were used by
the pilot, the co-pilot or both.
   The goggles came into controversy in 1988 after 17 soldiers were
killed at Fort Campbell when two helicopters collided during a
night flight on which the pilots were using the goggles.
   The goggles have since been updated. Harralson said it was not
known if the goggles used on Tuesday's flight were of the early or
latter version.
   The Chinook, the Army's mid-size helicopter, is used as a troop
carrier or to slingload items such as artillery and fighting
vehicles in battle areas.
   Safety officials from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker,
Ala., arrived at the fort Wednesday to begin an investigation.
Harralson said there were witnesses to the crash. That, coupled
with survivors' testimony, should speed the investigation, he said.
   The survivors included the pilot and co-pilot, but the pilot was
in critical condition at Vanderbilt University hospital in
Nashville, officials said.
   Everyone aboard was from the post's 7th Battalion, 101st
Aviation Regiment, said Harralson.
   The names of those killed were withheld until relatives could be
notified, he said.

<HEAD>Nuns, Families Grieve Bomb Deaths, IRA Conveys Its Regrets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small, aging band of nuns
grieved as a family Wednesday for a sister killed by chance by an
IRA bomb along with three police officers.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary in Armagh said it had detained two
men for questioning but gave no other information about the
investigation. Detectives told Britain's domestic news agency,
Press Association, they were searching for seven men thought to be
behind the Tuesday afternoon attack.
   Sister Fiona Fullham, regional superior of the Sisters of St.
Louis, said Wednesday, ``I would pray that all those in Northern
Ireland who have been involved in violence would try to think of
the human face of the people who have died and who are dying, and
of the families who are suffering needlessly all these years..
   ``I would say, please stop. Please stop.''
   The explosion killed Sister Catherine Dunne, 37; Constable
William James Hanson, 37, and reserve officers Joshua Cyril Willis,
35, and David Sterritt, 34.
   Nearly 2,800 people have died in political and sectarian
violence in the British province since 1969, including 273 police
officers. Sister Catherine was the first nun.
   The Irish Republican Army said it set off the half-ton bomb
hidden beneath a rural road near Armagh, but left it to its Sinn
Fein political wing to express regret.
   ``Our sorrow at these deaths is genuine and profound, but will
be abused by our political opponents who will cynically exploit
yesterday's events for their own political purpose,'' Martin
McGuinness, a Sinn Fein leader in Londonderry, said.
   The officiers, in one car, were killed outright. Sister
Catherine was in an oncoming car and died of injuries at a hospital.
   A passenger in her car, social worker Cathy McCann, 25, was
reported in satisfactory condition Wednesday, but still unaware her
friend had died.
   Wednesday's statement of regret, similar to one issued when the
IRA killed a 20-year-old Catholic girl in Warrenpoint in April
1989, was rejected in advance by Irish and British politicians and
Protestant and Catholic leaders.
   Killing Catholics is particularly embarrassing for the IRA.
Although condemned by the church, the IRA claims to be protector of
the 600,000 Catholics in the Protestant-dominated province.
   ``If I hear one more deeply regrets statement from the IRA I
think I shall take to the streets with a gun myself,'' said British
lawmaker Anthony Beaumont-Dark of the governing Conervative Party.
   The IRA unit in North Armagh took responsiblity for the blast.
It sent a message to news media saying the nun was the victim of
``unforeseen and fluke circumstances.''
   Funeral services for Hanson and Willis were set for Thursday.
Sterritt and Sister Catherine will be buried Friday.
   Sister Corina Muldoon, director of St. Joseph's School,
remembered Sister Catherine as a lively woman, an enthusiastic
swimmer and jogger.
   ``At this time when vocations are less and less, and our
communities are getting older and older, a young sister is quite a
treasure,'' she told reporters.
   The community, in Middletown since 1875, has 16 members.
   ``It's only when it comes home to your own door that you
appreciate what death by violence is like,'' Sister Fiona said. ``
... When it's one of your own, you really realize what it must be
like for the families of each one who has died by violence in
Northern Ireland.''
   In Dublin, Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins on Wednesday
expressed revulsion at the killings and said, ``I hope that the
overwhelming reaction to this outrage will cause those who support
the IRA and their actions to stop doing so, once and for all.''
   Des O'Malley, leader of the Progressive Democrats, the junior
partner in Ireland's government, said Sister Catherine's death
would have a special impact.
   ``It shouldn't have to, but this brings home the daily
sufferings of people in Northern Ireland more forcibly than would
otherwise be the case,'' he said.
   After Wednesday's news conference, the sisters at St. Louis
Convent served sandwiches and tea, and Sister Corina apologized
because they could not be more hospitable.
   Eight miles away in Caledon, a grave was being dug outside St.
John's Anglican Church for Willis.
   He and his fellow officers ``will be forgotten next week, but
not by their families,'' said the Rev. Frank Beamish, who had known
Willis for 29 years.
   He prepared Willis for confirmation, officiated at his marriage,
baptized his sons David, 4, and Andrew, 1, and worked with him as a
church warden and member of the choir.
   ``It's shattering,'' Beamish said.

   A couple was sentenced Wednesday to up to
seven years in prison for beating their adopted son to death just
eight weeks after he came to live with them.
   Bernice and Gerald Kittelberger were sentenced to two and
one-third to seven years in prison for the death last August of
2-year-old Maurice West.
   ``Maurice was not treated like a child, he was treated like a
piece of property,'' said Monroe County Judge Donald J. Wisner.
``This was a brutal crime.''
   Bernice Kittelberger, 32, was convicted in a non-jury trial in
May of manslaughter and second-degree assault. Gerald Kittelberger,
30, was convicted of second-degree assault.
   Even though Mrs. Kittelberger was convicted on two charges and
her husband on one, the judge said he saw no reason to give her a
longer sentence than her husband.
   Before sentencing, the Kittelbergers told Wisner they didn't
intend to hurt the child.
   ``I loved my child very much,'' Mrs. Kittelberger said in a
tearful, barely audible voice. ``If my loving him is wrong, then
I'm sorry. What I have done may not have been right, but I loved my
baby.''
   ``I can only ask God for forgiveness,'' Gerald Kittelberger
said. ``It's just something I have to live with for the rest of my
life.''
   The sentencing hearing was attended by Dale and Janice May,
Maurice's foster parents in Cincinnati until he was adopted by the
Kittelbergers. The Mays had wanted to adopt Maurice but were turned
down because they were white and the child was black. The
Kittelbergers are black.
   Dale May said he would have liked to see a stiffer sentence.
``Nothing's too much for them,'' he said.
   Mrs. Kittelberger faced a maximum possible prison sentence of 15
years and her husband a maximum sentence of seven years.
   Assistant Monroe County District Attorney Richard A. Keenan
asked Wisner to impose the maximum sentence to ``send a message to
the community that child abuse will not be tolerated ... that
Maurice's death was not in vain.''
   During the trial, Monroe County Medical Examiner Dr. Nicholas T.
Forbes testified that Maurice died as a direct result of repeated
and severe beatings.
   Witnesses said Maurice's face, legs, buttocks and genitals were
severely bruised and swollen and there were partially healed burns
on his palms and the backs of his hands.
   Mrs. Kittelberger told police that Maurice had died after
choking on oatmeal. Both Kittelbergers admitted beating the toddler
with a belt, a paddle and a stick wrapped in tape to punish him for
resisting toilet training.
   Since Maurice's death, the Mays have won a civil suit against
adoption officials in Hamilton County, Ohio, requiring that more
consideration be given to interracial adoptions.
   The adoption hadn't been made final before the child's death.

<HEAD>DDT Linked To Pancreatic Cancer in Chemical Plant Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chemical company warned former and current
employees Wednesday that a study shows for the first time a
possible direct link between pancreatic cancer and the insecticide
DDT.
   The study by the University of Michigan focused on 28 cases of
pancreatic cancer among Rohm &amp; Haas employees who worked at its
Philadelphia plant from 1948 to 1971, when DDT and related
chemicals were produced there.
   Other researchers expressed caution at the preliminary results,
saying too little was known to definitively draw a link between the
chemical and pancreatic cancer, the fifth-leading cancer killer.
   DDT is known to cause liver cancer at high doses in mice, but is
not known to cause cancer in humans, said Albert Heier, a U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency spokesman. The pesticide was banned
in 1972 over concerns about its adverse effect on the environment
and wildlife and its persistence in the food chain.
   Rohm &amp; Haas spokesman George Bochanski said the company received
a draft of the study from Dr. David Garabrant about two weeks ago
and decided to release the results to its employees. Bochanski said
the company held meetings with current employees Wednesday and had
sent letters to former employees.
   ``We felt it was appropriate to let our workers know now,''
Bochanski said.
   Garabrant and Rohm &amp; Haas officials did not release a copy of
the study, saying it was only a draft.
   Garabrant and company officials said that, based on the study,
DDT could neither be identified nor ruled out as the cause of the
pancreatic cancer.
   But they said the study was the first link between DDT, which is
known to cause cancer in laboratory animals, and pancreatic cancer
in humans. Garabrant ruled out other chemicals or lifestyle risks,
such as smoking.
   ``We really have to look at this further'' before drawing
conclusions about DDT's link with pancreatic cancer, the EPA's
Heier said.
   The study was prompted by a 1987 report by Rohm &amp; Haas that
found 16 cases of pancreatic cancer among the 6,000 employees at
its Philadelphia plant from 1948-71. Only about nine cases of the
cancer would normally be expected, according to Bochanski.
   The national rate of pancreatic cancer is about 9 cases per
100,000 people, resulting in about 28,100 new cases and about
25,000 deaths a year, according to the American Cancer Society.
About 3 percent survive five years or longer.
   The current study, commissioned by Rohm &amp; Haas, used the same
employee population but researchers discovered 12 additional known
cases of the cancer.
   Garabrant said the study examined the medical records of all 28
employees diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and compared them to 112
other employees _ matched for age, sex and race _ who did not work
with DDT, and questioned them or surviving relatives about
lifestyles, such as smoking or diet.
   Rohm &amp; Haas manufactured DDT until 1971. The company did not
know the amount of DDT to which the employees had been exposed nor
the length of their exposure.
   An epidemiologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center, Thomas Mason,
cautioned against reading too much into Rohm &amp; Haas' early results.
   DDT is stored in the body's fat, so a diet high in fat could
affect the study's results, he said. He suggested that further
research on the plant's rate of pancreatic cancer and DDT examine
the connection to diet.
   Bochanski said it was uncertain what the company's next step
would be.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Cocaine Influenced Former Prosecutor Who Jumped Bond</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine and the influence of a female capital
murder defendant led a former Dallas County prosecutor to jump bond
on a federal drug charge, a doctor testified.
   ``He was heavily addicted to cocaine _ to the point where he was
losing weight. It was ruining his health,'' said Dr. Robert John
Powitzky, a clinical psychologist who examined Mike Wilson. ``He
also was very caught up with a charismatic, probably psychotic
woman.
   ``It was something willpower would not stop.''
   Wilson himself said Tuesday at a detention hearing that cocaine
was the reason he fled with Joy Davis Aylor, who's still on the
loose.
   ``I left because I was scared. I didn't see any way out,''
Wilson testified during the hearing before U.S. Magistrate John B.
Tolle. ``The whole thing was a nightmare to me.''
   Tolle, who had released Wilson on personal recognizance before
he fled, denied a request to free him again, on bail, so he could
enter a drug treatment program.
   Wilson had pleaded innocent to charges of accepting 46 pounds of
cocaine in exchange for his legal services. He was arrested March
21 by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Dallas.
   He left town May 5 with Mrs. Aylor, who is accused of hiring a
hit man to kill her husband's girlfriend in 1983. Wilson and Mrs.
Aylor were involved romantically.
   Wilson, a former Dallas County assistant district attorney, said
he considered suicide before he was captured June 11 in British
Columbia, but had planned to surrender.
   ``Mr. Wilson was trying to come back when he was arrested,''
said his attorney, Gary Noble. ``He knows running away is not the
answer.''
   Wilson said he has not used cocaine since his initial arrest in
March but that his mind was still affected by the drug when he ran
off with Mrs. Aylor.
   Mrs. Aylor had been scheduled to go on trial May 14. She was
free on $140,000 bond when she fled.

   President Bush promised support Wednesday for
the people of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in their quest for
freedom from the Soviet Union.
   Bush held a ceremony in the Rose Garden marking ``Captive
Nations Week,'' an event that the presidents have observed annually
since the Eisenhower era.
   Bush brought with him both a piece of the Berlin Wall and a
swatch of barbed wire that came from a now dismantled barrier on
the Austria-Hungary border.
   ``These two symbols of tyranny should never be forgotten,'' Bush
told his 100 guests, many of them refugees from communist lands.
The audience also included a group of young interns from Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   ``They are here learning how a free society works and will
return to build a free Poland, a free Hungary, a free
Czechoslovakia,'' the president said.
   ``But while we celebrate for those who are now free, we must
also remember those who are not,'' said Bush.
   He recalled the scene from China's Tiananmen Square last year
``where iron tanks were met by the iron will of a courageous lone
man.''
   ``Today I also want to remember especially the people of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia and renew our unflagging support for their
long quest for national self-determination,'' he said.
   ``The road ahead is going to be difficult. But we can now join
them in looking forward with hope to the day when their long,
cherished dreams will become reality,'' he said.
   He asked the audience to pray ``that the next Captive Nations
Week will be the last.''
   The United States has never recognized the forcible
incorporation of the three Baltic states into the Soviet Union in
1940 under pressure from Stalinist troops. Lithuania declared its
independence from Moscow this spring, prompting Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev to impose an economic embargo on the republic.
   Bush has urged restraint on both sides, while repeatedly
affirming U.S. support for the Baltic states' right of
self-determination. The Soviet leader recently eased the economic
blockade after the Lithuanian parliament in Vilnius suspended its
declaration of independence.
   The Kremlin is expected to start negotiations soon with the
Lithuanians. Gorbachev has said it might take several years for the
situation to be worked out.
   The Lithuanian parliament has also demanded independence, voting
again last week to nullify the 50-year-old Soviet declaration of
power.

<HEAD>Britain Announces Big Defense Cuts, Halving Troops in Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain, NATO's most hawkish member, said
Wednesday it plans to pull half its troops from West Germany and
cut its overall regular forces by 18 percent in response to a
reduced Soviet threat.
   The United States announced defense reductions after last year's
democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe. But British officials had
cautioned against any quick decisions to slash forces.
   In Wednesday's announcement to the House of Commons, however,
Defense Secretary Tom King acknowledged the lowering of global
tensions.
   ``Our aim is an orderly and planned transition to the new world
unfolding,'' said King. ``It is a time of opportunity and hope for
change, yet without putting at risk the safe protection of our
country.''
   The moves, which also call for eliminating 19 warships and
submarines by 1995, will produce substantial savings, King said.
But he gave no immediate indication of the size of the Conservative
Party government's ``peace dividend.''
   King said Britain will make no reductions in its nuclear
arsenal. Britain still plans to modernized its submarine-borne
Polaris nuclear missiles by the mid-1990s with a more powerful
Trident system bought from the United States. Wednesday's
announcement followed a five-month review of defense spending by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a committee of top Cabinet
ministers. Mrs. Thatcher has been among the highest defense
spenders in the Western countries' North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   In the most dramatic proposal, King said the government
envisaged that by 1995, Britain will have two rather than four
divisions assigned to defend West Germany. It will also halve the
number of air bases there.
   Britain has about 66,700 servicemen deployed in West Germany,
including the 55,000-member British Army of the Rhine. They are the
second biggest foreign military presence after the United States.
   In other deep conventional arms cuts proposed by the mid-1990s,
King said the Royal Navy's submarine fleet will be reduced from 27
to 16 _ three-fourths of them nuclear-powered.
   The British naval fleet of frigates and destroyers will be cut
from 48 to 40, King said. That move reverses a Conservative Party
pledge to maintain a fleet of about 50 warships.
   The number of Royal Air Force squadrons will drop from 15 to
about nine.
   King said the reductions hinge on several factors: the signing
of an East-West accord on conventional arms cuts, final
arrangements for German unification and the pace of withdrawal of
Soviet troops from other East European countries.
   King said that by the mid-1990s, he envisages a British army of
120,000, down from 160,000; and the Royal Air Force with 75,000
personnel, down from 89,000. The Royal Navy and Royal Marines would
be cut by only 3,000 personnel to 60,000.
   In addition, King said there will be further immediate savings
of $1.1 billion from Britain's $38.6 billion defense budget for the
fiscal year ending in March. He said the army would ease back on
recruiting, and officials would retire several ships and submarines
early.
   Despite his other comments, King said the Soviet Union remained
the mightiest military force in Europe. He warned that if President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev lost power, Britain could not ``suddenly try
to recall'' its forces.

<HEAD>Tainted Raccoons May be Source of Mercury for Some Panthers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Endangered Florida panthers may get a
lethal dose of mercury when they dine on raccoons that apparently
pick up the poison by eating Everglades fish, scientists say.
   Recent laboratory analyses found significant amounts of mercury
in the livers of raccoons captured in the eastern Everglades, said
Melody Roelke, a veterinarian for the Panther Recovery Project.
   ``Those cats who eat these mercury-laden raccoons will pick up
mercury, but it may not be the only source,'' Roelke said Tuesday
in presenting her findings to officials from four state and federal
agencies.
   The tainted raccoons were found in the same Shark River Slough
area where a 4-year-old female panther known as No. 27 died of
mercury poisoning last year.
   Panther No. 17, one of the largest and oldest known panthers at
154 pounds and 8 to 10 years old, was found dead Monday. Its
remains were so decomposed biologists don't think they'll be able
to find out what killed it.
   It's believed only 30 to 50 panthers remain in South Florida,
and they face threats ranging from habitat loss to cars on the
roads they sometimes cross.
   Roelke estimated that a 75-pound panther eating a 6-pound
raccoon daily from the Shark River Slough would accumulate a toxic
dose of mercury in 14 weeks.
   ``What that means is everything from uncoordination, visual
problems to seizures and death,'' Roelke said.
   In the case of panther No. 27, ``there's a good probability that
she moved into that slough about four months prior to her death.
This is compatible with the time course for an animal eating
nothing but raccoons every day.''
   Officials cautioned that the data, while cause for concern, was
preliminary, and they said raccoons make up a main part of the
panther's diet in only a few areas.
   Raccoons eat fish. State health officials have warned against
eating fish from several areas of the Everglades because of the
mercury.

<HEAD>Ads Tell Teens Drugs Or Alcohol Can Lead To AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new advertising campaign unveiled Wednesday
will try to persuade teen-agers that drugs and alcohol can lead to
careless sex, which can lead to AIDS.
   ``AIDS. Another way drugs can kill you,'' the public service ads
say.
   The $3 million, three-year campaign launched by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse and the Advertising Council is the first
targeted at teen-agers, the age group that has one of the fastest
growing rates of AIDS cases.
   Among teen-agers 15-19, about 57 percent are sexually active,
public health experts said. According to last year's Annual High
School Survey conducted by the institute, 51 percent of seniors
have used an illegal drug.
   Intravenous drug use is often associated with AIDS because the
virus, transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, can be
spread by sharing needles with an infected user. But the new ads
are aimed at use of alcohol and drugs not normally injected, like
crack, cocaine and marijuana.
   ``If you become influenced by alcohol or drugs and then whether
you decided ahead of time to abstain from sex or use a condom,
you're so wiped out that you forget ... protection goes out the
window,'' said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary of health in
the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Studies have shown that people are more likely to have sex and
less likely to use condoms when they are under the influence of
drugs or alcohol, he said.
   ``We're trying to get out front and discourage kids _ or adults
_ from using drugs in the first place,'' he said.
   Mason said public health officials are concerned about the
rising rate of AIDS among teens _ up by 35 percent between January
1989 and May 1990, from 342 cases to 530.
   He also noted that one-fifth of all people with AIDS are in
their 20s _ about 27,500 people. Because the average time from
infection with the AIDS virus until onset of the disease is
believed to be nine years, many of these people probably were
infected during their teens.
   The campaign features radio, television and print ads in which
teen-agers are in sexual situations. In the TV ads, directed by
Martin Scorsese and narrated by Spike Lee, the teens are at a house
party, on the beach or in a car. Lee also narrates the radio spots.
   In the print campaign, one ad shows a picture of a wrecked car
and below it a teen-age couple kissing in a car. Copy under the
first photo reads: ``This fatal accident was caused by teen-agers
getting stoned and going too fast.'' The caption under the second
picture reads: ``So was this one. AIDS. Another way drugs can
kill.''
   Mason said that ``some may be offended by the forthright nature
of these messages. But if we are to save lives, we must speak to
teens in a language that will get their attention, make them listen
and understand.''
   As of the end of May, 136,204 people in the United States had
been diagnosed with AIDS, and 83,145 of them had died. As many as
1.5 million Americans are believed to have been infected with the
virus, with 40,000 to 80,000 new infections each year, Mason said.

<HEAD>Foley Says Frank Will Overcome Expulsion, Censure Moves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Wednesday
predicted that Rep. Barney Frank will withstand Republican attempts
Thursday to expel or censure the Massachusetts Democrat for his
actions on behalf of a male prostitute.
   With Frank saying he would likely take to the House floor in his
own defense, Foley, of Washington, said Wednesday that most
Democrats and some Republicans would accept a House ethics
committee recommendation that Frank merely be reprimanded _ the
mildest sanction available. The matter is expected to come before
the full House Thursday.
   ``In this case, a unanimous vote of the ethics committee should
be accepted by both party leaderships and supported on the House
floor, and it's what I believe the House will do,'' Foley said in a
Capitol Hill news conference.
   Frank, one of two acknowledged homosexuals in Congress, already
has publicly apologized for his actions on behalf of male
prostitute Stephen Gobie and has said he may apologize to the
House. In a brief interview Wednesday, Frank said he would
``probably'' participate in the debate.
   ``It does seem to me that I have an obligation to speak to my
colleagues on this issue,'' Frank said.
   Some House members are seeking a tougher penalty against Frank.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia is supporting a
bid to censure Frank, a penalty that would cost the fifth-term
congressman his Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship. And Rep.
William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., said Wednesday that he was rounding
up support for a move to expel Frank from the House, an action seen
as unlikely.
   The 12-member ethics committee, split evenly between Democrats
and Republicans, ``has come up with what I consider less than what
the incident deserves,'' Dannemeyer said. He rejected the
committee's conclusion that Frank was telling the truth when he
said he immediately kicked Gobie out of his Capitol Hill apartment
in 1987 when he learned that Gobie was operating a prostitution
business from there.
   Dannemeyer said Frank had to have known of and countenanced the
prostitution all along.
   ``If there's one thing any of us should be responsible for is to
be responsible for what's going on in his own home,'' Dannemeyer
said.
   The ethics committee dismissed charges that Frank was aware of
the prostitution.
   Instead, the committee cited Frank for writing a misleading memo
that was sent to a Virginia prosecutor overseeing Gobie's probation
on a sex and drug felony conviction. The committee said the 1986
memo could be interpreted as an attempt to convince authorities to
be lenient toward Gobie. The committee said also that Frank
improperly used his congressional authority to avoid paying 33
parking tickets, some of them received by Gobie while on personal
business.
   Thursday's debate was expected to be the first item on the House
agenda. Foley set aside one hour of debate on the expulsion
proposal followed by a vote, and another hour on whether the
reprimand recommendation should be increased to a censure. There
would likely be separate votes on the censure and reprimand issues.

<TEXT>
   Jewish activists donned concentration camp
uniforms Wednesday to protest what they called West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker's ``obscene'' plan to meet with
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim.
   Four activists led by New York rabbi Avi Weiss stood outside the
main gate of Weizsaecker's sprawling West Berlin palace, holding a
large photo of Waldheim in a Nazi uniform.
   ``Weizsaecker's decision to be the first German leader to
embrace Waldheim, who has a Nazi past, is obscene,'' said Weiss,
who has led similiar protests against Waldheim in recent years.
   He said the group planned a large protest Thursday in Salzburg,
Austria, where Weizsaecker and Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel
are to pay a private visit to the Austrian leader.
   The visit represents a thaw in an informal boycott of meetings
with Waldheim by Western leaders since Waldheim's election in 1986
to a six-year presidential term.
   Waldheim served in the German army in Yugoslavia during World
War II and a U.N.-commissioned panel of experts has concluded he
was in a position to know about Nazi atrocities.
   Havel, the highly regarded playwright who led the democratic
revolt against Czechoslovakia's Communist government last year, has
come under the most criticism for the planned meeting.
   There has been little criticism in Germany of Weizsaecker's trip.
   Weizsaecker spokesman Gernot Fritz said ``it is a private visit.
He is meeting with Waldheim not in his capacity as president, but
as a private person.''
   Fritz, speaking in Bonn, West Germany, on Wednesday, said no
official talks were planned. He said the visit is in conjunction
with the opening of the Salzburg Festival of music and drama on
Thursday.
   Havel was quoted as saying that the boycott of Waldheim by
foreign statesmen has become ``a certain way stereotyped, and a
game.''
   In an interview with the Salzburger Nachrichten on Tuesday, he
said ``by its ritualization, it effectively becomes a cliche.
   ``And there is not a bit of moral courage in this, but a
cold-blooded calculation: if one won't go, nor will the other. They
are simply afraid of each other,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Weizsaecker was in his Bonn office when the protesters gathered
outside his West Berlin office, the Castle Bellevue, an 18th
century residence of Hohenzollern princes.
   Guards kept the protesters, clad in the black-and-white striped
shirts of concentration camp inmates, from entering the gate on the
stately grounds, where Weiss tried to deliver a personal letter for
Weizsaecker.
   Several police officers were called, and they allowed the group
to recite Hebrew prayers outside the gate.
   ``Please don't let a German officer arrest a Jewish rabbi,''
Weiss told a police officer who ordered the group to disperse.
   Weiss said the protest in Salzburg would be bolder and larger.
   He said the group came to Berlin even though they knew
Weizsaecker would not be there because it was the old Nazi capital.
   ``We felt we should come to Berlin on the way to Salzburg
because this is a time of Germany's unification, when many people
are asking whether Germany is going to be different from its
past,'' he said.

   Prospects for better relations between North
Korea and South Korea, and for possible expanded U.S. trade with
North Korea, have improved in the past two months, a senior State
Department official said Wednesday.
   At 11 meetings between U.S. and North Korean officials held in
Beijing since last year, the United States has spelled out steps
that could lead to closer ties between the two countries, said
DeSaix Anderson, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs.
   ``The moment is clearly propitious,'' Anderson told the House
Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee, saying the United States is
looking for progress in North Korea's dialogue with South Korea, an
agreement on nuclear safeguards, assurance that the North eschews
terrorism and a process for returning remains of U.S. Korean War
dead.
   The United States does not expect all of those actions at once,
he said, but for each positive move by North Korea, the United
States will respond in kind.
   If all of the steps are taken, ``the stage would certainly be
set for a major improvement in our relations,'' Anderson said,
adding that there are a range of possible U.S. responses, ``on the
trade front, and so forth.''
   U.S. trade with North Korea now is minimal. In 1989, the
government issued export licenses for $8.4 million worth of goods
that meet ``basic human needs,'' the standard set when limited
exports began in 1988.
   Anderson cited the May 28 return of five sets of remains at the
North Korean capital of Panmunjom, and said the United States
regards that as ``an indication that North Korea wants to improve
its ties with the United States.''
   He also noted an agreement between the North and South for a
meeting of their prime ministers in September and October, the
highest-level such session since 1945.
   ``These talks may mark a turning point in inter-Korea
relations,'' Anderson said. How the United States responds to North
Korea will depend in part on the quality of that dialogue and any
subsequent exchanges, he said.
   Anderson said the United States had received no word of
terrorist acts sponsored by North Korea in the past 18 months.
North Korea was put on the official U.S. list of terrorist
countries after the bombing of a South Korean airliner in 1987.
   Adding to pressure for North Korea to emerge from its isolation
is the comparative economic wealth of South Korea, whose economy
has been booming for years, and a diminution of support from the
Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Anderson said.

   A former Chicago Tribune news editor on
Wednesday was appointed editor of The Anchorage Times.
   J. Randolph Murray, 44, replaced Hugh Cunningham, who was hired
as interim editor shortly after Veco International, an oil-field
services company, bought the newspaper in December, said Publisher
Bill Allen.
   Murray was news editor of the Tribune's Washington bureau from
1986 until last year. Before that, he was an assistant managing
editor at the Chicago daily and had worked for the Tribune-owned
Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel.
   Murray, a graduate of Georgia State University, joined the Times

   Cunningham, 69, is a former University of Florida journalism
professor with more than 50 years in the newspaper business.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Carey, the Bishop of Bath and Wells and a
supporter of the ordination of women, was named the 103rd
Archbishop of Canterbury on Wednesday.
   Carey was a surprise choice to succeed Robert Runcie as
spiritual leader of the state Church of England and 70 million
Anglicans worldwide, including 2.5 million Episcopalians in the
United States.
   ``To be nominated as the 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury is a
sacred trust and I feel dazed and unworthy,'' said Carey, the
54-year-old son of a hospital porter who has remained close to his
Cockney roots.
   ``Because I have a strong sense of history I am keenly aware of
entering into a rich heritage of faith, learning and spirituality.''
   His appointment was announced by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who chose him from two names submitted by the 16-member
Crown Appointments Commission, a church-elected body. The other
name remains a secret.
   Runcie, who must retire by his 70th birthday on Oct. 2, 1991,
has said he will retire at the end of January.
   As archbishop, Carey will be appointed to the Privy Council,
which advises the queen, and become a member of the House of Lords,
the unelected upper chamber of Parliament.
   Carey was not on any list of those considered main contenders to
lead the church. But the speed of the announcement, which had not
been expected until fall, indicated the nominating commission was
unanimous.
   The 16-member commission forwarded the two names to Mrs.
Thatcher two weeks ago. She met Carey on Monday and decided to
recommend him, government sources said.
   An evangelical Christian, Carey is know for his orthodox views.
However, he also favors the ordination of women and close relations
with Roman Catholics and other Protestant churches, and is an
avowed environmentalist.
   ``I want to be a pastoral archbishop,'' he told a news
conference.
   Carey holds a doctorate from King's College London. He was
principal of Trinity Theological College in Bristol between 1982
and 1987 and honorary canon of Bristol Cathedral before being named
Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1987.
   The two frontrunners for the archbishop's post, Archbishop of
York John Habgood and Bishop of Liverpool David Sheppard, are
liberals and were opposed by the conservative wing of the church.
   Sheppard called Carey ``a gifted and able man who will serve the
church and the nation faithfully with strength.''
   Habgood, 63, said: ``There is a little human bit in anybody that
likes the top job'' but he said that in his ``heart of hearts'' he
thought he was too old for it.
   Runcie welcomed the ``imaginative appointment,'' a sentiment
echoed by the Rt. Rev. Robert Williamson, Bishop of Bradford, who
called it ``exciting.''
   Carey served in the Royal Air Force as a radio operator before
being ordained in 1962. He is married, has two sons and two
daughters and, in a Who's Who entry, lists his recreation as
jogging.
   He said he would encourage signs of ``new life and vigor'' in
the church and hoped to bring in people like those he grew up with
in London's East End. For them, he said, ``all too often the church
seems light-years away.''
   The Rt. Rev. Michael Baughen, the Bishop of Chester, said Carey
``has the Church of England very much in his heart, is a man of
mission, is extremely well-grounded theologically, and has a warm
and delightful personality with a real understanding of life.''
   But Tony Benn, a left-wing lawmaker from the opposition Labor
Party, criticized Mrs. Thatcher's role in the appointment and
repeated his call for the separation of church and state in Britain.
   Christianity was introduced into England within 300 years of the
death of Christ, probably by Roman soldiers then occupying the
country.
   In 597, Pope Gregory the Great sent 40 missionaries to England
headed by a monk, Augustine, to preach the Gospel to the nation.
They landed in Kent, where Augustine was made the first archbishop
of Canterbury that year.

<HEAD>Reagan's Daughter Criticizes Tuna Fishing Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan's daughter Patti Davis
on Wednesday blasted Reagan administration policies that she said
contributed to the killing of more than 20,000 dolphins annually.
   Acknowledging that this figure represented a substantial
reduction in dolphin deaths associated with U.S. tuna fleet
fishing, Davis said she was ``not inured to hearing the tuna
industry ... congratulating themselves on bringing the numbers down
from over 100,000 to 20,000.''
   ``During the Reagan administration, implementation of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act was stalled at 20,500 dolphins per year,''
said Davis in testimony before the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   ``That's 20,500 too many,'' added Davis, who was backing a bill
to require labeling of tuna caught by setting nets on dolphins. She
spoke on behalf of the Earth Island Institute, a California-based
environmental group.
   Environmentalists have long sought to protect dolphins from
being snared in nets cast to catch tuna. In the eastern Pacific
Ocean where dolphins swim with tuna, purse seine nets are
intentionally dropped below schools of dolphins to capture the tuna
underneath when a drawstring is pulled to close the net.
   Davis, 37, blamed tuna industry lobbying and ``the
anti-regulatory stance of the Reagan administration'' for weakened
regulations concerning dolphin protection techniques.
   Davis argued that the Marine Mammal Protection Act aims at a
zero rate of dolphin kill by tuna fisherman and that the nation
should follow the example set by U.S. tuna canners.
   In April, the three largest U.S. tuna canners _ companies
selling StarKist, Bumblebee and Chicken of the Sea brands _ said
they would no longer buy or sell tuna captured along with dolphins.
Last month they began labeling such products ``dolphin safe.''
   The bill, S-2044, would require seafood and tuna distributors to
label their products to disclose whether the contents were caught
using dolphin-safe methods.
   Additionally, the labeling measure provides for penalties based
upon volume of canned product and citizen suits against members of
the tuna industry in the event of intentional or unintentional
violations.
   The Bush administration and U.S. fisherman oppose the
legislation, saying it would destroy the U.S. tuna fleet, reduce
tuna stock and do little to help save dolphins.

   Relatives of a man charged with fatally
plunging his 2-year-old stepson headfirst into a toilet testified
Wednesday that he was a good father and may have been coerced into
confessing.
   Thomas Coe's defense in his first-degree murder and aggravated
child abuse trial began after more than a week of state testimony
that he routinely abused stepson Bradley McGee and confessed on
tape to the boy's dunking death.
   Prosecutors are seeking the electric chair for Coe, 23, if he's
convicted.
   ``I don't think it's true at all,'' brother Jerry Coe testified.
``I know that he put it on a tape. But I also know he was probably
exhausted and coaxed on by the state and the sheriff's department.''
   Only a day before, jurors listened to Coe on tape admitting to
investigators that he was irate, out of control and having a ``bad
day'' when he dunked the toddler into the toilet as punishment for
soiling his pants.
   Bradley died of head injuries July 28, 1989, two months after he
was ordered returned from state foster care to his mother, Sheryl
Coe, and stepfather Coe.
   Mrs. Coe, 21, has testified for the prosecution that during
those two months her husband carried out a bizarre pattern of abuse
against Bradley, often forcing the child to use his mouth to pick
feces off the floor, and grinding his fist and cayenne pepper into
the boy's genitals.
   Mrs. Coe has pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and
aggravated child abuse and is serving a 30-year prison term.
   Defense attorneys have acknowledged Coe dunked the child into
the toilet, but say he should be convicted of a lesser crime
because it was merely a one-time form of punishment and there was
never any intent to harm the child.
   Coe's sister-in-law, Melinda, testified that Coe was kind and
caring to Bradley and his own infant daughter, Rebecca.
   ``Do you think he killed Bradley?'' prosecutor John Aguero asked.
   ``No I do not,'' she said. ``He's a good father. And the way he
treated Bradley in his trailer and the way he treated my son and
the way he treated his daughter _ there's no way in hell.''

   After almost a week of hostility, Spanish and
Cuban officials said Wednesday they were intent on finding a
solution to the forced entry of 18 Cubans at the Spanish Embassy.
   As negotiations were proceeding in Madrid, Spain's top diplomat
here told reporters there had been a ``notable'' improvement in the
climate with Cuba since some harsh exchanges last week.
   Embassy Charge Ignacio Ruperes meanwhile said Spanish
authorities are still not sure whether nine of the Cubans were
police agents sent to thwart the asylum bids of the others, who had
arrived earlier.
   ``If they are police or not police, I cannot tell you,'' Ruperes
told a small group of reporters outside the embassy. Reports
persist that several of the would-be asylum-seekers are government
provocateurs.
   Last week, relations between the two governments hit a low point.
   Spain withdrew its ambassador and suspended a $2.5 million aid
program. Cuba said Spain should not have allowed the 18 to remain
because they were not suffering political persecution.
   Cuba has called for the ``voluntary and unconditional''
departure of the Cubans at the embassy. Spain has said it will not
expel the asylum-seekers.
   The crisis atmosphere seemed to be receding Wednesday. Cuban
officials echoed the conciliatory remarks of Ruperes and the nine
Cubans suspected of being police agents dropped plans for a hunger
strike.
   And, aside from the more civil relationship between Havana and
Madrid, three Cubans who had sought asylum in the Swiss Embassy
last weekend left the compound voluntarily Wednesday morning. Their
subsequent fate was not disclosed.
   Four Cubans remain at the Italian ambassador's residence.
   The wave of entries at foreign embassies began July 9, after
thousands of Albanians who had sought refuge at foreign embassies
in Tirana were allowed to leave by boat to Italy.
   Since then, more than 40 Cubans have sought refuge at a variety
of embassies here. According to some estimates, perhaps half were
government saboteurs on a mission to force out bona fide
asylum-seekers.
   When the break-ins began, many analysts recalled the period 10
years ago when 10,000 crowded the Peruvian Embassy, setting in
motion what became the Mariel boatlift. Over a five-month period,
125,000 Cubans left for Florida.
   At the time, there seemed little possibility that President
Fidel Castro would be toppled from power. But among some Western
diplomats here, there is serious question as to whether Castro
could survive a similar mass exodus now.
   He is more isolated than before, has far fewer allies because of
the reforms in the Soviet bloc countries and the economic situation
has weakened. Marxism is almost universally discredited and food
shortages, among other problems, have led to a rise in discontent.
   So Castro, anxious to keep the problem within manageable limits,
has taken steps to discourage additional Cubans from seeking asylum.
   Police have been deployed in large numbers at Western embassies.
In addition, Castro has taken a hard line toward those who have
entered embassies, warning that none will be permitted to leave
Cuba in a way that circumvents normal immigrations procedures.
   To some diplomats, one possible solution lies in a deal under
which the Cuban asylum-seekers would leave the embassies after
receiving promises from the Cuban government that no action will be
taken against them. They then would apply to leave the country
through normal means.
   Ruperes suggested both sides are eager for a settlement.
   ``On the Spanish side, there is serious will and I am almost
sure there is the same on the Cuban side to resolve the problem,''
he said.

   A Virgin Islands couple testified Wednesday
that they had felt pressure from the FBI to change their stories
and tell investigators they had seen Mayor Marion Barry use illegal
drugs on a 1986 boat trip.
   Albert Benjamin and his wife, Carmen, testified that they saw no
drugs on the trip, although Benjamin said he did see Barry smoke a
cigarette. He also testified he was unfamiliar with the smell of
marijuana smoke.
   Benjamin said he became suspicious when passengers on the boat
made repeated trips below decks, but said he could not see what
they were doing and ``was not interested in trying to find out.''
   ``I had suspicions that there was something out of the ordinary
going on on that boat,'' Benjamin said. ``I saw all of them going
below decks quite repeatedly.''
   Other witnesses have testified that drugs were used below decks
and that Barry took part in that activity.
   Barry's defense attorneys called the couple to dispute the
testimony of a prosecution witness who said the former Army
sergeant and his wife could have seen Barry use drugs during the
trip to the islands.
   Benjamin said that in several interviews law enforcement
officers ``kind of kept driving home the point that I had to know,
I had to see'' drug use by Barry and others on the trip.
   ``I got a little tired and angry,'' Mrs. Benjamin said in
describing her interrogation at FBI headquarters in Washington last
fall. ``I felt a little pressure.''
   On another subject concerning the boat trip, Benjamin told
jurors at Barry's cocaine and perjury trial that he became angry
when he saw Barry make sexual advances to Rasheeda Moore, the woman
who later figured in Barry's January arrest and has been the
prosecution's star witness.
   ``I was angry because I think adults should conduct themselves
in an appropriate manner in public ... my wife was sitting there,''
Benjamin said. ``I really didn't appreciate what I saw ... I felt
that was very out of place.''
   When asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts whether
Barry had been ``fondling'' Moore, Benjamin answered, `Yes, and she
accepted it.''
   Mrs. Benjamin said she did not see Barry and Moore together atop
the boat, but said she and her husband discussed it afterward.
   ``He was still quite angry,'' Mrs. Benjamin said.
   Moore, who took part in the videotaped FBI sting operation that
led to Barry's arrest, testified earlier in the trial that she and
the mayor used drugs ``over 100 times.''
   Charles Lewis has testified that he and Barry smoked marijuana
on the boat trip that Benjamin testified about.
   Benjamin said he agreed to go on the boat ride because of his
long association with Lewis' family. ``It was a spur of the moment
thing,'' said Benjamin.
   Earlier Wednesday, Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy raised
questions about FBI involvement with cocaine-laden business cards
alleged to have been found with Barry's belongings when the mayor
was arrested at a Washington hotel.
   Mundy showed the court that mixed in with the cards were two
business cards of an FBI agent.
   Frank Steele, a different FBI agent who seized the mayor's
belongings when he was arrested, said he couldn't explain how the
cards got there, but speculated they merely indicated who later
conducted tests on Barry's cards.
   Mundy also said that Steele's own notes from the arrest
indicated he took possession of Barry's belongings at 8:41 p.m.,
while the videotape showed Steele gathering the business cards at
8:56.
   Steele explained that he took Barry's suit jacket at 8:41 and
the business cards at an unspecified later time.
   Tests conducted on the cards have shown traces of cocaine.
Numerous government witnesses have testified that the mayor snorted
powder cocaine by placing the drug on a business card and inhaling
the drug.
   Mundy said after court ended for the day that ``a decision has
been made'' on whether or not Barry will testify, but he declined
to say if the mayor will take the stand. Barry is being coached by
other attorneys in the event that he testifies, Mundy added.
   Barry's lawyers also want to attack the prosecution's witnesses
by introducing medical testimony that cocaine hinders the user's
ability to recall events accurately.
   All of the major witnesses against Barry testified that they had
used cocaine.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he would rule
Thursday on whether to allow expert testimony on the subject from
doctors.

   A black South African businessman held
without trial for three years for alleged sabotage was freed
Wednesday, hours before the government was scheduled to lift a
25-year-old state of emergency.
   Immigration officials then briefly detained Leslie Lesia, 53,
anew before deporting him to neighboring South Africa.
   Lawyers for Lesia said senior immigration officials waited for
Lesia outside Chikurubi maximum security prison near Harare,
questioned him in downtown Harare, and then saw he was driven to
the main airport and put aboard a Johannesburg-bound flight without
a passport or travel documents.
   He was not allowed to speak with reporters.
   Lesia was arrested in May 1987 under sweeping emergency powers
that allowed for indefinite detention without trial.
   He was accused of importing a booby-trapped TV set into Zimbabwe
from Mozambique earlier in 1987.
   The set exploded in a Harare apartment, killing the wife of an
official of the South African guerrilla organization, the African
National Congress.
   Lesia accused Zimbabwean authorities of torturing him after his
arrest. He said interrogators broke both his legs with ax handles.
He also said Zimbabwean agents abducted him in Mozambique and
brought to Zimbabwe against his will.
   State prosecutors in Harare admitted they did not have enough
evidence to convict him in court, but security authorities opposed
releasing him because of his suspected contacts with South African
agents.
   In announcing last week that the emergency was being lifted,
Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi said Lesia was the only
detainee held in Zimbabwe without trial.
   Mahachi cited reforms in South Africa, easing of regional
tensions and political harmony at home as reasons for ending the
emergency at midnight Wednesday.
   The white minority government of former Rhodesian Prime Minister
Ian Smith introduced the state of emergency in 1965 to crack down
on black nationalists, now in power.
   Since Rhodesia became black-governed Zimbabwe in 1980, the
emergency has been renewed every six months by a parliamentary vote.

Mirror</HEAD>

   A NASA team investigating the flawed
mirror that crippled the Hubble Space Telescope started hearings
Wednesday at the plant where the mirror was made amid reports that
tests showed a problem in 1981.
   The seven-member team, led by Lew Allen, director of NASA's jet
propulsion laboratory, took testimony in secret Wednesday at
Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., formerly a division of
Perkin-Elmer Corp.
   Interviews with employees and a review of data pertaining to the
Hubble mirrors' testing and manufacturing were to continue Thursday.
   Thomas Arconti, spokesman for Hughes-Danbury, said no
information relating to the investigation would be released while
the probe was under way.
   NASA scientists have said the flaw in the $1.5 billion telescope
will cut the Hubble's abilities in half and can only be partly
corrected through a space mission scheduled for 1993.
   The Hubble has two mirrors, a main mirror and a secondary
mirror. NASA scientists have said the problem appeared to be a
spherical aberration, a problem in the shape of the primary mirror.
   The Hartford Courant reported Wednesday that scientists may have
discovered that flaw in May 1981, but dismissed the evidence
because they believed it was the result of a faulty testing
apparatus.
   One source, a retired Perkin-Elmer scientist, told the Courant
that the 1981 test showed a possible spherical aberration in the
main mirror, a 94-inch structure that NASA had called the smoothest
large mirror in the world.
   But the scientist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
test results were assumed to be incorrect at the time because they
contradicted tests done with an instrument thought to be more
accurate.
   ``It's the smoking gun,'' the scientist said.
   Perkin-Elmer built the mirrors between 1979 and 1982. Hundreds
of employees put in more than four million hours of work on the
project.
   The company also built part of the telescope's guidance system.
   The retired scientist said that despite the 1981 test results,
additional testing did not appear necessary at the time. Those
working on the mirror were under pressure to finish because of
delays and cost overruns, he added.
   ``Time and money was always a factor at that point in the
program,'' he said. ``They were rushing to shut us down as fast as
possible.''
   The company had originally been awarded a $63 million contract,
but cost overruns left NASA with a total bill of $451 million.
   Abe Offner, another retired Perkin-Elmer scientist who designed
some of the mirrors' test equipment, told The Courant he didn't
know of the test results and didn't think the tests were the
problem.
   ``Why did they not do something about it?'' Offner said Tuesday.
``I don't know why it was not brought to my attention. I would have
said, `Let's check it out and see what the problem is.'''
   Jeffrey Clayton, NASA's deputy program scientist for the Hubble
project, told the newspaper Tuesday that NASA inspectors in Danbury
at the time probably were aware of the test results.
   Allen, the leader of the NASA probe, said: ``I'm confident we
have the ability to find the error. And the results will be
embarrassing to someone or some group. But in order to get that
answer, we need people to be as candid as possible.''
   A statement on the team's progress would be issued from
Washington on Thursday, said NASA spokeswoman Sarah Keegan.
   The Perkin-Elmer division that built the mirrors was purchased
last year by Hughes Aircraft Co. of California.

<HEAD>Zambian President Announces Prisoner Release, Other Concessions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Yielding to demands of pro-democracy
activists, President Kenneth Kaunda announced Wednesday he will
release more than 1,000 prisoners and delay a referendum on ending
one-party rule.
   The opposition had demanded the postponement to allow for voter
registration. Pro-democracy campaigners welcomed Kaunda's
announcement but said he should go further.
   In another step, the president said a monthlong, overnight
curfew around the capital, Lusaka, was being lifted immediately,
but he warned that ``if anyone misbehaves it will be slapped back
on.''
   Kaunda said the prisoners would be freed by the end of August,
but he gave no exact number for those to be released.
   They include a lieutenant arrested after an abortive coup
attempt last month and the alleged leaders of two other coup
attempts. Others to be released are 34 student leaders held since
five days of violent anti-government riots in June.
   The president said he would put off the Oct. 17 referendum on
whether to end one-party rule to Aug. 21, 1991.
   Kaunda, whose United National Independence Party has ruled for
two decades, led Zambia to independence from British colonial rule
in 1964. He declared the southern African nation a one-party state
in 1973.
   In the face of burgeoning political opposition, Kaunda agreed in
April to hold a referendum on whether to return this nation of 7.5
million to Western-style multiparty democracy.
   Pro-democracy reformers have founded an alliance to campaign for
the referendum, but they say the voter-registry rolls must be
thoroughly updated.
   About 2.6 million people were registered as voters in 1987, but
the reformers say many of their supporters deliberately refrained
from registering then because they were disillusioned with Kaunda's
government.
   Arthur Wina, a former finance minister who is chairman of the
newly-founded National Interim Committee For Multiparty Democracy
Referendum, welcomed the prisoner release, but he said all
political prisoners should be freed.
   He also said that although the opposition had wanted a
postponement of the referendum, the 10-month delay was too long and
would encourage ``fraudulent activities.''
   At a news conference in Lusaka, Wina also repeated the
committee's demand for the repeal of state of emergency laws giving
the government sweeping powers of arrest.
   In his announcement, Kaunda said he had no plans to step down
unless voters demanded it, and he criticized pro-reform activists
as ``the maximum forces of hatred.''
   ``I will not abdicate my responsibility to this nation because
of thuggery,'' he said.
   The Zambian leader has been fighting a wave of unrest, but he
insisted he was not pressured into making the concessions.
   ``What I have announced today does not come from extreme
weakness but extreme strength _ morally, politically and
materially,'' Kaunda told reporters and ruling-party colleagues at
his official residence in Lsuaka.
   Anti-government riots broke out in June after a 120 percent
increase in the price of cornmeal, a staple. At least 26 people
died in the unrest, the worst since independence.
   The food protests quickly escalated into political opposition to
Kaunda.

<HEAD>Chilean Mass Grave Believed to Contain 26 Bodies of Leftists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Wednesday it has
found another mass grave in the Atacama desert where victims of
Chile's former military regime are believed buried.
   Officials said the latest grave is thought to contain the
remains of 26 suspected leftists.
   Belisario Velasco, undersecretary of the Interior Ministry, said
the bodies were apparently destroyed with dynamite. It was not
clear why dynamite was used, but the victims may have been blown up
after they were shot to death to make identification more difficult.
   The exact number of bodies in the grave has not been determined,
but several skulls and other bones as well as pieces of decomposed
clothing were found, Velasco said.
   Officials on Wednesday sent a team of doctors and
anthropologists to investigate the grave in the desert near Calama,
a mining city 960 miles north of Santiago.
   It was found by relatives of dissidents executed in the region
shortly after the 1973 military coup that ousted the elected
Marxist government of Salvador Allende and propelled Gen. Augusto
Pinochet to power.
   His 16-year authoritarian rule was stained by charges of
widespread rights abuses. While in power, Pinochet decreed an
amnesty for all rights abuse that occurred before March 1978.
   
   Pinochet was succeeded on March 11 by Patricio Aylwin, an
elected civilian. The general remains commander-in-chief of the
army.
   Military authorities had reported shortly after Pinochet's coup
that 26 leftists were sentenced by a special military tribunal and
executed on Oct. 23, 1973, in Calama. Relatives were notified, but
the bodies were never delivered.
   Rosa Silva, president of an association of relatives of the
victims, said Wednesday that the group believes the bodies in the
latest grave may be those of the leftists executed in Calama.
   ``However, we are not sure, and we have to be very careful and
make an investigation in depth, because we must respect the pain
and the feelings of the relatives,'' she said.
   Officials announced June 5 that another mass grave had been
found in the same desert outside the Pacific fishing village of
Pisagua, 1,185 miles north of Santiago. That grave contained 20
bodies identified as those of leftists taken prisoner after the
1973 coup.
   It was the third grave found since the country restored
democratic rule. A total of 23 bodies have been unearthed. Several
of them have been identified, including that of a former Communist
congressman.
   However, about 700 leftists who disappeared under military rule
remain missing.
   Authorities say they are also nvestigating reports of other mass
graves around the country.
   After meeting with army commanders, Aylwin said on June 21 that
military chiefs deny knowing where any missing victims of
anti-leftist repression may be buried.

<HEAD>U.S. Team to Repatriate Six Sets of Remains from Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials said
Wednesday they are returning to the United States with six sets of
human remains collected by Cambodians that are believed to be of
American MIAs from the Vietnam War.
   It marks the first time since the end of the war in 1975 that
Communist Cambodia has allowed the repatriation of suspected
remains of Americans missing in action.
   A 14-member U.S. repatriation team was scheduled to arrive in
Phnom Penh early Thursday by an Air Force C-141 cargo plane.
   A military honors ceremony was planned for Thursday at the Phnom
Penh airport, and immediately afterward, the remains will be flown
to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, agencies that account for
America's wartime missing.
   Since Tuesday, a six U.S. military experts have been in Phnom
Penh to examine sets of remains collected by Cambodians in recent
years _ the first such MIA mission to Cambodia since the 1975
Communist takeover.
   ``We came and did our work and the cooperation was everything we
asked for,'' Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, the U.S. team leader, told
reporters after meeting with Dith Munty, first deputy foreign
minister of the Vietnamese-backed government.
   Eighty-three Americans are listed as missing in action in
Cambodia from the war. A military spokesman earlier said 82 were
missing in Cambodia, but later raised the number to 83. The
confusion apparently concerned an aircraft that crashed near the
Cambodian border, leaving a GI missing.
   At least eight American civilians are also listed as missing in
Cambodia, according to U.S. officials.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. team examined 28 sets of
remains in a tiny laboratory at Cambodia's only medical college.
The teak caskets contained bones, skulls and at least two sets of
military identification ``dog tags.''
   A Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesman said his government paid
$2,000 for the return of some remains from remote provinces.
   Harvey said six sets of remains warranted further analysis at
the military laboratories in Hawaii to reach a positive
identification.
   Four were found in outlying provinces and two were from an area
southwest of Phnom Penh known as Choeung Ek, which was used as a
mass execution ground by the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge when
they ruled the country from 1975 to 1978. The Khmer Rouge were
ousted after Vietnamese forces invaded the country in late 1978.
   However, it was unclear if the remains found in Choeung Ek dated
from the period when the Khmer Rouge held power.
   The U.S. mission broke a long political stalemate between
Washington and successive Communist governments in Phnom Penh over
the MIA issue.
   Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd, a team spokesman, said past U.S. efforts
to examine remains in Cambodia had been ``either ignored or
politicized.''
   He said Washington would consider sending another such team to
examine more remains, but added that this was not discussed during
his group's visit to Phnom Penh.
   The United States does not recognize the Phnom Penh government.
But a week ago, Washington announced it was withdrawing recognition
of the Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla coalition that is fighting
the Phnom Penh government, and would open talks with Vietnam on
ending the Cambodian civil war.
   Cambodia's Deputy Interior Minister Khim Ponn, head of a newly
formed MIA commission, said he wanted to discuss normalization of
diplomatic relations, but the Americans limited talks to the issue
of missing Americans.
   Most of the Americans missing in Cambodia are airmen whose
planes were downed during bombing raids from 1969 to 1973 on the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, the major supply route for the North Vietnamese
into South Vietnam that wound through the mountains of eastern
Cambodia.
   A total of 2,299 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action in Indochina. Aside from those in Cambodia, 1,678 are
missing in Vietnam, 533 in Laos and six in China's coastal waters.

   Iraqi troops will begin pulling back from
the border with Kuwait at dawn Thursday prior to direct talks to
try to solve the two nations' dispute over land and oil production,
diplomatic sources said.
   The sources, based in the Persian Gulf, said Wednesday that the
development was viewed as a victory for the small sultanate of
Kuwait in their propaganda campaign.
   Kuwait insisted that Iraq withdraw what it said were massed
forces at their common 100-mile border before Kuwait would sit down
for negotiations this weekend with Baghdad, the sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The sultanate wanted Iraq, with more than eight times the
population of Kuwait, to move away from its muscle-flexing, they
said.
   The sources credited intensive mediation by President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Tuesday night for
lightening the crisis atmosphere. Mubarak kept in contact with the
Iraqis and Kuwaitis into early Wednesday, they reported.
   The announcement of direct Iraqi-Kuwaiti talks was made by
Mubarak on Wednesday in Cairo amid an escalating anti-American
campaign in the Iraqi media. The state-run newspaper said Iraq
would not bow to U.S. pressure in the dispute.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein summoned U.S.
Ambassador April Glaspie for talks. Government radio gave no
details of the meeting.
   In Kuwait, diplomatic sources said Saddam assured Mubarak that
he would not use military force as long as Kuwait agreed to the
following conditions: paying compensation for $2.4 billion in oil
Iraq claims Kuwait stole, and holding direct talks on a border
dispute.
   The oil allegedly stolen was from the Rumaila oil field, which
includes land claimed by both Iraq and Kuwait.
   In addition, Iraq wants Kuwait to write off billions of dollars
in loans it granted Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, and it wants the
reopening of a border air corridor.
   The dispute flared last week when Iraq accused Kuwait of
stealing the oil and alleged that Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates were causing a slump in oil prices by exceeding their OPEC
production quotas.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
price-monitoring committee began meeting in Geneva on Wednesday to
set prices for the rest of the year. Iraq wants a cut in production
to force a $7 increase per barrel.
   Mubarak met with leaders from Kuwait and Iraq on Tuesday. He
told reporters in Cairo on Wednesday that direct talks would
probably begin Saturday or Sunday in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
   ``Two delegations from both sides will sit and discuss the
problem. Of course it will take several meetings,'' he said. ``Only
the two delegations with each other,'' he said when asked who would
sponsor the meeting.
   Mubarak also said Saddam had denied sending troops to the
Kuwaiti border, despite reports to the contrary.
   ``What is present there was present before. I can tell you there
is no intention from President Saddam to move any troops toward
Kuwait,'' Mubarak said when asked when Iraqi troops would be
withdrawn from the border.
   Diplomats in Iraq and Persian Gulf states said that soon after
the dispute erupted last week, travelers saw battlefield missiles,
armored personnel carriers and tanks prominently displayed along
the road from Iraq to Kuwait.
   Diplomatic sources in Bahrain said Tuesday that a Washington
Post report of 30,000 Iraqi troops at the border appeared to be
correct.
   In a show of support for Kuwait, the Pentagon announced Tuesday
that U.S. warships and aircraft would hold a ``short-notice
exercise'' 600 miles to the south in the Persian Gulf with a second
small state, the United Arab Emirates.
   In apparent reference to this, the Iraqi newspaper Al-Jumhuriya
on Wednesday accused Kuwait of ``implementing an American-Zionist
plot to show that America is playing the role of protector in the
gulf.''
   The paper said Kuwait ``should be aware that those who are
threatening the interests of the Arab nation and conspire against
it will not be protected by foreigners.''

   Eastern Airlines and several of its top
maintenance managers were charged Wednesday with conspiring to
falsify safety and maintenance records to avoid costly flight
delays and cancellations.
   ``This indictment is about failure to maintain aircraft _ both
regular maintenance and parts that are faulty,'' U.S. Attorney
Andrew J. Maloney said in announcing the charges. ``The motivation
was to get the airplanes into the air. An airline only makes money
with planes in the air.''
   The federal grand jury indictment is unprecedented in the
airline industry and adds to Eastern's woes as it seeks to regain
passengers, build service and reorganize under federal bankruptcy
protection after a bitter strike.
   None of the alleged violations caused accidents or injuries,
authorities said.
   The 60-count indictment charges conspiracy to defraud the
government, wire fraud, falsification of documents and obstruction
of justice. It names the airline and nine high-level managers,
including Edward Upton, the former vice president of maintenance
and engineering.
   Until a few days ago, five of the defendants were still employed
as maintenance supervisors by the airline, Maloney said. A 10th
employee would be named in a separate document, he said.
   In a statement, the Miami-based airline said that during the
last two years it had taken ``full corrective action under the
scrutiny of the Federal Aviation Administration.''
   ``Today there is no question that Eastern is safe. Eastern has
its share of problems _ operating a safe airline is not one of
them,'' the statement said.
   FAA Administrator James B. Bussey said the airline now meets the
agency's safety standards.
   ``We are carefully studying the indictment and if we find
anything that gives us cause for concern ... we will take whatever
action is necessary to protect the traveling public,'' he said.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Martin Shugrue, appointed by a
federal bankruptcy judge to run the airline, said Eastern would
admit fraudulent maintenance and record-keeping practices, but not
conspiracy.
   He termed the purported violations ``ancient history,'' said the
problems had been corrected and insisted the airline was safe.
   Maloney said the violations took place from July 1985 to October
1989 at Kennedy and La Guardia airports in New York, Hartsfield
International Airport in Atlanta and Eastern headquarters in Miami.
   The investigation began after an Eastern maintenance supervisor
voluntarily went to Maloney's office and told him about alleged
irregularities.
   During the 10-month investigation, a federal grand jury
uncovered a pattern of top airline managers ordering that
maintenance not be performed on aircraft but that records be made
to falsely show that it was, Maloney said.
   By tampering with log books, work cards and computerized
maintenance records Eastern ``did cause aircraft that were not
properly maintained or repaired to fly and carry unsuspecting
passengers,'' the indictment said.
   The charges involved critical items including radar, landing
gear, automatic pilots and fuel systems, Maloney said.
   Upton and other managers pressured ``supervisors and mechanics
to sign off on airplanes that had not had their regular maintenance
or corrective maintenance in order to get the plane in the air, or
perhaps risk their jobs,'' Maloney said.
   Among the irregularities cited by Maloney were a failure to
properly remove accumulated water from fuel tanks. The water can
freeze at high altitudes and clog fuel lines and makes fuel gauges
read high.
   In Atlanta, he said, workers installed defective or untested
cockpit instruments to make it appear that corrective repairs had
been made.
   If convicted on all counts, Eastern faces a maximum fine of $30
million. Each individual defendant faces up to five years in prison
and fines up to $250,000 for each count.
   ``This case is not about money or fines, this case is about
deterrence and a very important area of public safety,'' Maloney
said. ``This is one of those indictments that is trying to send a
message to the entire airlines industry.''
   Eastern's employees went on strike March 4, 1989, and the
company filed for bankruptcy protection five days later. Pilots and
flight attendants quit the strike several months later but the
mechanics remain on strike.
   Shugrue said Eastern expected to turn a profit in 1991. It is
projected to lose about $500 million this year after an $852
million loss in 1989.
   Maloney said prosecutors had no evidence of improprieties at the
airline since Shugrue assumed control.

   NASA's last-ditch effort to fix
Atlantis' hydrogen leak on the launch pad failed Wednesday, forcing
the trouble-plagued agency to postpone the space shuttle's flight
until later this year.
   NASA engineers, who had hoped to avoid a long launch delay by
quickly repairing the leak on the pad, said the shuttle must be
returned to the hangar for more work. It had been scheduled for a
secret military mission this month.
   Shuttle Columbia, still under repairs because of a different
sort of hydrogen leak which scrubbed a May launch, will be the next
shuttle to fly. It is scheduled for an astronomy mission in early
September, and NASA says it expects the leak to be fixed in time.
   The developments came as a space agency team began probing the
cause of NASA's highest-profile problem: the flawed mirror on the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   The seven-member team, led by Lew Allen, director of NASA's jet
propulsion laboratory, took testimony in secret Wednesday at
Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., the maker of the mirror.
   The flaw has halved the effectiveness of the telescope, which
was put in orbit on an April shuttle mission.
   NASA, facing mounting criticism in Congress because of the
string of setbacks, got one piece of good news Wednesday: A
thrice-delayed Atlas rocket launch finally went off without a flaw.
   The rocket carried a government device designed to study
electric fields in space and the Van Allen radiation fields.
   ``It's good to have something positive happen,'' said NASA
spokesman Jim Cast. ``It's a definite boost to NASA morale.''
   The Atlas launch had been delayed three times, because of a
power problem, bad weather and a helium leak.
   On the shuttle, experts had hoped Atlantis' problem could be
solved by simple launch pad repairs. But the leak reappeared during
a test Wednesday and, after analyzing the data, engineers concluded
they still didn't fully understand the problem.
   ``We were not able to fix it. We have learned more so we will
roll back smarter,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space
flight program.
   NASA will try to launch Atlantis on its classified Pentagon
flight in November.
   The latest leak, detected when liquid hydrogen was pumped into
Atlantis' external fuel tank, was about the size of the leak
detected in two previous tests and was in the same area, a flange
in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to the main
engines.
   Workers tightened bolts around the flange and checked the welds,
even though engineers doubted that would be enough to correct the
problem.
   Had the spot been leak-free Wednesday, NASA would have tried to
launch Atlantis in mid-August and Columbia in September.
   Now officials intend to get Columbia ready to move to the launch
pad in early August, said shuttle director Robert Crippen.
   NASA officials want to get at least one shuttle up before
Discovery's October mission with Ulysses, a satellite that will
explore the sun's poles. Discovery has a 19-day ``window'' in which
it must lift off or the mission will be delayed 13 months. That
would be the next time Earth is in proper alignment again with the
sun and Jupiter.
   If NASA hadn't tried to fix Atlantis at the launch pad, ``we
would have forever wondered if we could have gotten two off before
Ulysses,'' Lenoir said.
   The delay in launching Atlantis means NASA must bump yet another
mission into next year. The space agency originally had planned
nine shuttle flights for 1990, but now is down to seven. So far,
only three have been flown.
   Columbia had been due to lift off May 30 with the $150 million
Astro observatory for study of ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted
by stars and other celestial objects. Columbia's leak was detected
during fueling, six hours before liftoff.
   The space agency has since replaced Columbia's leaky plumbing
with components from the unfinished shuttle Endeavour. Columbia's
leak is believed to be larger than the one plaguing Atlantis and in
a different place.
   Crippen said it's too soon to say how Atlantis' leaky fuel line
will be repaired. One option is to attach a new external tank.
   The discovery of Atlantis' first leak, on June 29, prompted NASA
to temporarily ground its three-shuttle fleet. The leak reappeared
during a more elaborate test two weeks later.
   The Hubble telescope isn't expected to fulfill its potential
until space-walking astronauts make repairs in 1993.
   Allen of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said the Hubble probers
hoped to find what Allen called a ``smoking gun and a fingerprint
on the trigger.''
   Investigators, who expected to stay through Thursday, also
planned to examine reams of data pertaining to the manufacturing
and testing of the mirror, and equipment used to test the accuracy
of the mirror.
   NASA's proposed space station Freedom also is under attack.
Studies show the station will require more maintenance than is
feasible unless major design changes are made.

<HEAD>Three Lawyers Freed in Kenya, But Four Detainees Charged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday freed from jail
three pro-democracy lawyers but charged four other people with
plotting its overthrow.
   The U.S. Embassy and human rights activists who had demanded the
lawyers' release hailed the decision to free them. But they said
other detainees should also be freed.
   President Daniel arap Moi and other Kenyan leaders have been
struggling to put down a popular pro-democracy movement. They argue
that more than one political party in this East African country of
about 21 million residents would lead to wars among the estimated
40 tribes.
   The lawyers released Wednesday were Gitobu Imanyara, John
Khaminwa and Mohamed Ibrahim. They could not be immediately reached
for comment.
   They had been rounded up before a rally planned for July 7 to
demand a multiparty political system. Police tried to block the
rally, which led to riots in Nairobi and four other cities. At
least 28 people died and scores were injured.
   The government gave no reason for freeing the three lawyers.
Kenyan law permits detention without charge or trial of individuals
the government considers a threat to state security.
   In New York, the Africa Watch rights group attributed the
release to international pressure. Executive Director Rakiya Omaar,
in a statement faxed to The Associated Press, said international
press coverage ``has estroyed the myth of Kenya as a haven of peace
and political stability.''
   The U.S. Embassy welcomed the release, but it expressed hopes
that other detainees would also soon be released. ``We hope the
cases of those remaining in custody can be resolved rapidly,'' said
an embassy spokesman.
   The new charges were against former parliament deputy George
Anyona, former university dean Ngotho Kariuki, rural ruling party
official Augustine Kathangu, and university lecturer Edward Oyugi.
   The government accused them of taking part in a meeting whose
participants had ``seditious intentions of overthrowing the Kenyan
government by unlawful means.''
   The four had been held without charge since July 12, when they
were arrested together at a Nairobi-area pub.
   Still in detention are former Cabinet ministers Charles Rubia
and Kenneth Matiba, as well as Raila Odinga, a businessman and the
son of former Vice President Oginga Odinga. They are all leading
advocates of multiparty politics.

<HEAD>Six Killed, Seven Injured in Helicopter Crash Near North Sea Oil
Facility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A helicopter crashed Wednesday in the North Sea as
it was approaching an offshore tanker loading facility, killing six
people and injuring seven others, the Shell oil company said.
   The accident involving a Sikorsky helicopter raised new concerns
about safety in the North Sea oil fields, where there have been at
least four aircraft crashes the past four years. In July 1988, 167
men were killed in an oil platform fire.
   About 60 North Sea oil workers refused to fly out to the
oilfields on Sikorsky helicopters until the cause of the crash has
been determined.
   A Shell spokesman said half the men were staying in hotels on
the Shetland Islands at company expense and the rest had returned
to Aberdeen, Scotland, by plane.
   British Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson told the House of
Commons that the cause of the crash was not known. He said
visibility was about two miles at the time and ``doesn't seem to
have been a factor'' in the accident.
   John Prescott, the opposition Labor Party spokesman on
transport, told the House of Commons that a door had fallen off
another Sikorsky helicopter on Tuesday. He did not elaborate.
   The crash occurred at 10:55 a.m. as the helicopter was
approaching the Brent Spar, an offshore tanker loading facility
serving the four platforms in the Brent oil field operated by Shell
U.K. Exploration and Production.
   The helicopter, carrying 13 passengers and crew, plummeted into
the water about 100 yards from the facility, Ian Henderson, Shell
U.K.'s deputy managing director, told BBC Television.
   The helicopter was operated by British International
Helicopters, Ltd., a company chaired by British publisher Robert
Maxwell, a statement from Maxwell's office said.
   Rescuers in helicopters and boats, including a special diving
vessel, immediately converged on the crash site, about 115 miles
northeast of Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands.
   Shell chairman Bob Reid told reporters at a news conference that
the seven injured survivors were pulled from the water within 20
minutes after the crash.
   Shell said the survivors were first ferried to a nearby company
facility for treatment. One of the rescued men suffered a broken
leg, Henderson said.
   Parkinson said the injured were then taken to an Aberdeen
hospital. He said four of the survivors were seriously hurt.
   The bodies of the six victims were discovered in the wreckage by
a remote-controlled mini-submarine, a Shell spokesman said.
   He said the earliest the wreckage could be lifted and the bodies
recovered would be Thursday.
   Two of those on board were pilots, five worked for Shell and six
were employed by Shell contractors, she said.
   Britain's Department of Transport said it sent two inspectors to
the scene to investigate.

<HEAD>Anti-Semitism Defendant Fails to Appear at Trial</HEAD>

   The defendant in a highly publicized anti-Semitism
trial failed to appear in court for the second day of proceedings
Wednesday, and the judge ordered police to find him.
   Svetlana Birulina, lawyer for 64-year-old Muscovite Konstantin
Smirnov-Ostashvili, said he had not told her his plans, and she did
not know where he was.
   ``We don't have contact with each other,'' said the lawyer, who
was appointed by the court to represent Smirnov-Ostashvili because
his regular attorney is on vacation.
   Judge A.I. Muratov's order means Smirnov-Ostashvili can be
brought in forcibly by police, she said.
   On Tuesday, the opening day of the trial in Moscow's City Court
building, Smirnov-Ostashvili declared his distrust of the entire
Moscow Collegium of Lawyers to which Ms. Birulina belongs, and
sought her dismissal.
   Muratov refused his bid, but postponed the trial a day because
he could not maintain order in the crowded courtroom.
   On Wednesday, uniformed police with truncheons limited the
number of reporters and onlookers allowed into the courtroom.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili was arrested for allegedly being an organizer
of a Jan. 18 protest that broke up a meeting of writers as Moscow's
Central House of Literature and roughed up some participants.
   The case was widely publicized here and heightened Jewish fears
of anti-Semitic attacks.
   Speaking to reporters in the courtroom Tuesday,
Smirnov-Ostashvili denied being anti-Semitic, but charged that Jews
hold a disproportionate share of power in the Soviet Union.
   More than 71,000 Jews left the Soviet Union last year, and
thousands more are leaving this year. Jewish leaders cite ``an
unprecedented panic among the Jewish population'' in the face of
threats from extreme Russian nationalist groups such as the Pamyat
society.
   If found guilty, Smirnov-Ostashvili could be sentenced to up to
five years in prison under a new law that toughens punishment for
insulting people because of their ethnic background, or inciting
ethnic intolerance.

   Federal Aviation Administration officials said
Wednesday they would closely study the criminal indictment against
Eastern Airlines but believe the carrier is now fit to fly.
   ``Eastern Airlines today meets the FAA's safety standards for
operating an airline,'' said FAA administrator James B. Busey after
a federal prosecutor in New York announced the grand jury charges
against the airline and several managers alleging a conspiracy to
falsify maintenance records.
   ``We are carefully studying the indictments issued today, and if
we find anything that gives us concern regarding the current safety
disposition of Eastern, we will take whatever action is necessary
to protect the traveling public,'' Busey said.
   The FAA has the power to suspend a carrier's license to operate.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said FAA officials uncovered some of
the problems in the first place and turned over the findings to the
U.S. attorney's office in New York.
   The agency last year fined Eastern $839,000 for some of the
safety violations cited in the indictment _ a fine that has not
been paid because the airline filed for court protection from
creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws in March 1989.
   ``We're waiting in line with all the other creditors,'' said
Farrar.
   The FAA also revoked the licenses of several mechanics and was
prepared to shut down the airline's maintenance base at John F.
Kennedy Airport in New York, Farrar said, after it investigated
allegations of records falsification. But Eastern closed the
installation when confronted with the evidence, he said.
   ``The FAA intends to continue with the intense surveillance now
in place at Eastern Airlines and will continue to cooperate fully
with the U.S. attorney's ongoing investigation,'' Farrar said.
   Asked if the indictment would affect the way the FAA oversees
maintenance work at other airlines, the spokesman said, ``We think
it's pretty good, and we've been looking at Eastern awfully hard
ever since'' the violations were found.
   Meanwhile, the Washington-based Air Line Pilots Association said
the indictment is further vindication of its stand against Texas
Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo, who formerly controlled the airline.
   Eastern is now run a court-chosen bankruptcy trustee, Martin
Shugrue.
   ``We take great comfort in knowing that when a panel of ordinary
citizens finally was presented with just a few of the safety
violations in a proper legal forum, they found sufficient cause to
act against Eastern,'' the pilots' union said.
   ``We hope that the irony of this development is not lost on
those in Washington who abdicated their responsibility to protect
Eastern's customers,'' the union's statement said.
   Pilots cited Eastern's alleged maintenance shortcuts as one
reason for joining a strike by the Machinists union that forced the
airline into filing for bankruptcy.
   The 60-count indictment against the airline and nine high-level
managers charges conspiracy to defraud the government, wire fraud,
falsification of documents and obstruction of justice.

   The Senate formally denounced Sen. Dave
Durenberger on Wednesday for ``knowingly and willfully'' violating
its rules and ordered him to make restitution of up to $123,000 for
money he received improperly.
   Durenberger, R-Minn., made no attempt to fight the vote to
denounce him. Speaking in a quiet voice, he pledged to strive to
become ``first a better man and then a better senator.''
   The somber judgment marked the 24th time in 201 years that the
Senate disciplined one of its own. The vote was 96-0, and after
rendering their verdict many senators lined up to shake
Durenberger's hand, some embracing him.
   Durenberger and fellow Minnesota Republican Rudy Boschwitz voted
present.
   Durenberger was disciplined for violating Senate speaking fee
and gift limits, misleading the Senate on real estate transactions
involving his Minneapolis condominium and converting a campaign
contribution to personal use.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the Senate Ethics
Committee, set the stage for the dramatic vote when he solemnly
accused Durenberger, who watched from a front-row desk, of
violating his public trust.
   ``The evidence of knowing and willful misconduct is clear and
convincing and far more troubling than Sen. Durenberger's admitted
negligence, lack of wisdom or asserted misplaced reliance on
others,'' Heflin said.
   The committee findings will be referred to the Federal Election
Commission and Justice Department for further investigation, but
there have been no allegations of criminal wrongdoing.
   A tense calm hung over the crowded Senate gallery as tourists
and other passers-by listened as senator after senator stood to
praise Durenberger for his legislative accomplishments even as they
were condemning him for his ethical lapses.
   ``No one in this chamber is approaching this vote lightly,''
said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``The stones of denouncement are
easier to cast than they are to retrieve.''
   Heflin, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice, said there was
``convincing evidence that Sen. Durenberger knowingly and willfully
engaged in a pattern of unethical misconduct which violated
statutes, rules and standards of conduct.''
   The ethics committee said Durenberger should reimburse the
Senate $29,050, plus interest, for improper reimbursements he
received while staying in his Minneapolis condominium during
official trips from 1983-89.
   It also said he should pay $93,730, less state and federal taxes
previously paid, for speaking fees he improperly kept during 1985
and 1986.
   The fees were for 113 speeches Durenberger said were promotions
for his books on health care and defense issues. The committee
concluded they were normal honoraria speeches subject to Senate
limits.
   Durenberger, whose political fortunes have suffered at home,
told the Senate just before Heflin spoke that he would not contest
the committee's recommendation and earlier agreed to make
restitution.
   Durenberger sat at a desk at the front of the Senate chamber,
listening to the proceedings with his hand on his chin.
   ``I ask your forgiveness,'' Durenberger told his colleagues
after the vote. ``For future challenges, I need your friendship.''
   He called the experience a ``costly education.''
   ``As for the future, I would ask only that I be judged ... not
necessarily by what I say, but what I do,'' he said. ``Financial
restitution is only a beginning.''
   At a news conference after the Senate vote, Durenberger
reiterated his pledge to become a better senator.
   Durenberger, a 12-year Senate veteran, was elected to fill the
unexpired term of the late Sen. Hubert Humphrey. He does not face
re-election until 1994.
   The end of the Durenberger case will allow the ethics committee
to concentrate on pending investigations of six senators, including
five who received donations from savings and loan figure Charles
Keating _ and interceded with regulators on his behalf.
   In a case involving another lawmaker, the House ethics committee
has proposed that Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., be reprimanded for
improperly using his office to help a male prostitute. Action on
that recommendation is expected this week.
   Several Republican colleagues said they believed Durenberger's
judgment had been impaired by tragedies, problems he discussed
during a June ethics committee hearing.
   The senator's first wife died of breast cancer 20 years ago and
Durenberger said he was seeing a marriage counselor because his
second marriage was in trouble. The couple remains married.
   He also said he was affected by severe financial problems,
caused in part by educational expenses for his four sons.
   The chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus said Durenberger's
committee assignments and other duties would not be affected by the
Senate action. The major impact on Durenberger is the political
fallout in Minnesota, where some newspapers have called on him to
resign.
   Seven members of the Senate have been censured since the first
recorded case in 1811. One, Democratic Sen. Herman E. Talmadge of
Georgia, was denounced in 1979.
   Fifteen have been expelled, the most serious punishment.
   The last major ethics case involved New Jersey Democrat Harrison
A. Williams Jr., who resigned in 1982 as his colleagues were about
to oust him.
   In addition to the excess speaking fees, the committee found
that Durenberger:

   No sooner had they slapped him down than his
colleagues in the Senate lined up to shake Dave Durenberger's hand.
   ``He could have withered and fallen into self-pity and
bitterness,'' said Republican Whip Alan Simpson as the Senate voted
96-0 Wednesday to do what it likes to do least _ punish one of its
own.
   Instead of pitying himself, said Simpson, ``I have seen my
friend soften and mature and grow in this terrible process.''
   The debate was unusually personal. Several senators referred to
Durenberger by his first name. Many spoke of his personal problems
_ the death of his first wife, a troubled remarriage, four sons
undergoing difficult adolescences, tremendous financial strains _
what Simpson called ``truly hellish experiences.''
   Yet there was no flinching from the facts _ that he had violated
the Senate's rules by taking money not properly his and trying to
conceal his transgressions.
   Thus, hugs and praise alternated with descriptions of
cold-blooded wrongdoing as the Senate struggled with the paradox of
the popular Minnesota Republican.
   His judgment was impaired, his moral compass improperly
calibrated when he engaged in questionable condominium and book
promotion arrangements, said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., vice
chairman of the ethics committee that spent months investigating
him.
   ``I believe him and I sympathize with him.''
   Durenberger, 55, sat nearly impassively as his transgressions
were aired for three hours. He heard himself accused of willfully
evading rules and casting a pall on the institution, and in the
next breath labeled creative, decent, effective and influential.
   When it was all over, he said he was a better man and a better
senator; he would work even harder, shoulder more responsibility.
   ``I ask your forgiveness,'' he said. ``I need your friendship.''
   There seemed little doubt he would get both.
   ``Everybody who has spoken has made it so clear that they like
and admire Dave Durenberger,'' said Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo.
``After this is all over and we denounce him, we still want him to
be our friend.''
   The Senate was unusually full, with all committee business
suspended for the proceeding. The many who spoke said they did not
relish their task.
   ``I feel a special sense of discomfort,'' said Senate Democratic
Leader George Mitchell, noting he has worked closely with
Durenberger for years on health care and environmental issues.
   But Rudman added that Durenberger's conduct could not be excused
on that basis. And Durenberger, staring intently at him from across
the aisle, nodded in agreement.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Durenberger had ``approached this
ordeal with just about as much grace and resolve to reform as I
have witnessed in anybody in my life.''
   He said Durenberger's predecessor _ Hubert Humphrey _ ``would be
hugging Dave and I intend to after this ordeal is over.'' He did,
as did Simpson. Others patted Durenberger on the shoulder as they
engaged in long, intense handshakes.
   Some senators said they thought the trauma _ both Durenberger's
and their own in having to sit in judgment of him _ would produce
positive results.
   ``Sometimes hard times bring people together,'' said Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., a member of the ethics panel. He said the Senate has
not always been congenial lately but ``today I sense a sense of
feeling together, a sense of closeness and a sense of brotherhood.''
   And Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., predicted the stressful events
would deepen ``the personal relationships which Dave Durenberger
has forged with so many of us.'' He summed up the paradox this way:
   ``As senators we must unflinchingly exercise the judgment which
is required. ... As a human being I remain a steadfast friend of
Dave Durenberger's and an admirer of the legislative work he has
accomplished.''

Starvation</HEAD>

   The State Department on Wednesday accused
Eritrean rebels of recklessly exposing about 2 million of their own
people to possible starvation by refusing to reopen an Ethiopian
port to relief food.
   ``Their behavior is as reckless as it is inexplicable,'' the
department said in a statement read by deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher at the daily press briefing.
   On Tuesday, the United Nations abandoned efforts to reopen the
port of Massawa through which it hoped to ferry food for about 4
million people. On Monday, after four weeks of negotiations, the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLP) denied permission to a
U.N. vessel to enter the harbor to conduct a survey.
   ``This action was taken despite repeated public pronouncements
by the insurgents that they would welcome and facilitate a
reopening of the port under U.N. auspices,'' the State Department
said.
   The statement said the rebels were endangering the lives of some
2 million Eritreans they claim to represent. ``We hope that the
EPLF will re-evaluate its decision to turn back the U.N. vessel and
restate unambiguously its unconditional willingness to facilitate
an international effort to reopen Massawa for relief shipments.''
   The ship arrived Wednesday in Djibouti about 350 miles to the
southeast at the entrance to the Red Sea, said a U.N. spokesman in
New York, Paul Mitchell. It will remain there for a few days, said
the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   Another U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said the ``suspension
of the mission means that the famine-stricken and war-affected
population of Eritrea will be deprived of essential humanitarian
assistance vital for their survival.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, chairman
of the House Select Committee on Hunger, called the rebels' refusal
``a betrayal.''
   Hall said, ``Sadly, starvation is still being used as a weapon
in Ethiopia. The EPLF lied not only to us but to their own people.''
   Last Spring, forces of President Haile Mengistu Mariam blocked
relief by bombing the Red Sea port to strike against the insurgents
who were holding it.
   The Eritrean rebels, seeking independence from Ethiopia, are
locked in a civil war with the central government.
   In May, President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, acting on a pledge by Mengistu to stop attacking the
port, agreed to cooperate in helping the hungry in Ethiopia.

   Operation PUSH announced Wednesday the civil
rights organization would pressure Nike Inc. and other athletic
shoe companies to provide more jobs for minorities and women.
   PUSH founder Jesse Jackson says organization officials hope to
meet in 10 days with representatives of Nike of Beaverton, Ore., to
discuss the company's hiring and promotion practices and to prod
the company to use more advertising agencies and banks owned by
minorities.
   ``We are the margin of profit for the athletic shoe industry and
we want our fair share of jobs and investments in banks,'' said
Jackson. ``We seek to meet to redefine our relationship. Right now,
its unbalanced and unfair.''
   PUSH director Tyrone Crider said that from 30 percent to 40
percent of all basketball shoes sold in the United States are
bought by blacks.
   He said Nike was selected as the first shoe company to negotiate
with because it was the biggest, commanding 54 percent of the
basketball shoe market.
   Liz Dolan, spokeswoman for Nike said her company is ``well
within federal guidelines'' for minority hiring.
   ``No company has done more to promote positive black role models
to the public than we have,'' she said. The company's ads feature
filmmaker Spike Lee, basketball star Michael Jordan, football and
baseball star Bo Jackson and other black celebrities.
   Dolan said she had no figures on black representation in the
company. Jackson and Crider did not say what percentage of
minorities they thought the company should be hiring.
   Speaking to reporters at the end of PUSH's four-day national
convention in Chicago, Jackson the issue of inner-city youths
killing each other over tennis shoes and other athletic wear would
not be brought up in the negotiations with the companies.
   ``That's another question,'' he said. ``They are being shot with
bullets. Nobody has ever been shot with a gym shoe.''
   Some critics have attacked Lee, Jordan and others for doing the
shoe ads, saying they promote an obsession with the expensive
products in poor minority communities. Shoe company manufacturers
say the inner-city is not where most of the shoes are bought.
   Crider said a letter was sent by fax machine Wednesday to Philip
H. Knight, Nike founder and chief executive officer, asking for a
meeting and suggesting it take place next week in Chicago when the
athletic shoe industry holds its national trade show.
   But Dolan said, ``PUSH hasn't contacted us at all.''
   In the past, PUSH _ People United to Service Humanity _ has
pressed the automobile, beverage and fast-food industries to hire
more minorities.
   Jackson said PUSH would call for demonstrations and, possibly,
boycotts if the athletic shoe industry did not respond to demands
during negotiations.

   The vote Wednesday to denounce Sen. Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn., was one of three levels of punishment
senators can receive.
   The most serious sanction is expulsion.
   Durenberger received the next highest punishment, passage of a
resolution condemning a senator's behavior. The Senate can write
such a resolution as it pleases, using such words as ``condemn,''
``denounce'' or ``censure,'' and they all amount to pretty much the
same thing.
   The mildest form of punishment is a letter of criticism sent to
the senator by the Ethics Committee. Such a case does not involve
action by the full Senate.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court issued a temporary stay
late Wednesday just 12 hours before condemned killer Anthony
Bertolotti was to be executed. A federal judge earlier had rejected
arguments that Florida's electric chair is malfunctioning and
denied his appeal.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ordered the
stay until 7 p.m. Friday. The three-judge panel, which has held up
the execution of five other Florida inmates based on arguments of a
malfunctioning electric chair, said it would hear oral arguments
Friday.
   Bertolotti had been scheduled to die at 7 a.m. Thursday, but
after the stay was issued state officials rescheduled his execution
for 7:01 p.m. Friday.
   Earlier Wednesday, U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp agreed
with arguments from the state that a special test conducted on the
chair Monday ``show that at least 2,000 volts can be conducted
through the system ... and 2,000 volts are sufficient to cause
painless termination of life.''
   The judge ruled after a one-day hearing on the single issue of
whether the chair could carry out an execution without causing
``cruel and unusual punishment'' to the condemned man.
   Sharp said the chair had operated successfully since the John
Spenkelink execution in 1979 except for the May 4 electrocution of
Jesse Tafero.
   When Tafero was executed, flames and smoke were seen rising from
his head. Attorneys for other condemned killers have claimed that a
broken electrode in the headpiece had tortured the inmate to death.
   Sharp, the District Court judge, agreed with state findings that
an artificial sponge placed under the head electrode for the first
time had caused the botched execution of Tafero. He added that ``it
is unlikely that the circumstances of Jesse Tafero will happen
again.''
   Michael S. Morse, a biological engineer and teacher at Auburn
University who conducted tests of the chair on Monday, said there
was no indication of any flaw in the Florida State Prison execution
system.
   A videotape of the public test conducted Monday was shown in
court and in it, Morse says: ``I would say it is safe to conclude
that the electric chair works as it is supposed to ... there is no
question that this system is as lethal as any out there.''
   But Fred Leuchter, who designs and builds execution systems for
many states, disagreed sharply with Morse's testimony.
   ``The test was absolutely useless,'' Leuchter said.
   Noting that Morse had used a colander and a metal pipe for the
test, Leuchter said: ``If the state of Florida gets an executee in
the chair with a colander for a head and metal pipe for a leg, they
would have an execution.''
   Later, Leuchter said, ``the state of Florida is going to produce
a living vegetable if it is allowed to continue executions.''
   Leuchter and attorneys for other inmates contend that a broken
electrode caused the problems with the Tafero execution and that
the chair has not been fixed or modified since.
   Bertolotti's death warrant _ his third _ is good until Monday.
   The 38-year-old Bertolotti was sentenced to death for the fatal
stabbing of Carol Ward in her home in Orange County in September
1983.
   His execution originally was scheduled for 7 a.m. Tuesday, but
he got a 48-hour stay from the state Supreme Court Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>No Leak of Unemployment Figures Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department said Wednesday it could
find no evidence of a leak of unemployment statistics earlier this
month.
   The department's investigation was triggered by a report that
about a minute and a half before release of the June figures by its
Bureau of Labor Statistics on July 6, one trader sold bond futures
heavily on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``We looked into it. We have no evidence that there was a
leak,'' said spokesman Bob Zachariasiewicz.
   The department gives its monthly unemployment data to news
organizations at 8 a.m. on condition that it not be made public
until 8:30 a.m. This practice, called an embargo, gives reporters a
chance to digest the material before they must write their stories.
   Some other departments, such as Commerce and Agriculture,
release sensitive economic statistics to reporters in a locked room
and then let them out all at the same time _ a ``lockup'' release.
   Zachariasiewicz said the department receives allegations of
premature release from time to time, and ``we're continuously
reviewing our procedures, but as far as this incident is concerned
this appears to be the end of it.''
   He said the department could not even pin down how the report of
a leak originated, but: ``It appears some broker or analyst was
speculating to explain a market fluctuation.''
   The department has discussed ``possible changes in procedures
with different physical facilities,'' in other words, a lockup of
its own, ``but I don't foresee that we'll ever have the
facilities.''

<HEAD>Bush To Lawmakers: Hold Line On Defense Cuts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS new grafs 3-5: ``The defense,'' for 3rd graf pvs;

<TEXT>
   President Bush pleaded with lawmakers
Wednesday to spare the defense budget from cuts even deeper than
the $18 billion already targeted by the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   Bush urged key lawmakers on both congressional armed services
committees to press ahead with production of the B-2 bomber and
other major new weapons. The House is considering halting
production of radar-evading jets, which cost more than $800 million
apiece.
   The defense session came as Bush administration officials and
Republican congressional leaders agreed to a deficit-cutting
proposal they plan to present to Democrats at budget negotiations.
   The package consists of slightly more than $50 billion in
savings, split roughly evenly between new taxes and spending cuts,
according to Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and others. It would save
more than $500 billion over five years, relying heavily on cuts in
benefit programs such as Medicare, said one participant who asked
to not be identified.
   But it was unclear when the offer would be made.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that at either
Thursday's or Friday's meeting, both sides will ``simultaneously''
put proposals on the table for cutting $50 billion from the deficit
next year and $500 billion over five years.
   But Democratic budget bargainers disputed that, saying no
decision had been made on exchanging offers.
   ``That is so silly,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters
the two sides have tentatively agreed to extend from 1993 to 1995
the Gramm-Rudman deadline for balancing the budget.
   Gephardt said major differences in defense levels is a major
hang-up in reaching an overall budget compromise.
   Bush and the leaders discussed entitlement programs _ Social
Security, Medicare and other programs for the poor and elderly _
and ``both sides are troubled'' by the magnitude of cuts that might
be needed in those areas, Gephardt said.
   Despite Bush's earlier agreement that the government must pull
in more tax revenues, ``nobody wants to raise taxes. ... It's very
hard to put the final package together,'' the Democratic leader
said.
   After the defense session, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the House
Armed Services Committee chairman, lamented that Bush and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney still ``have in mind a much bigger defense
budget than I think is going to come out of this process.''
   Aspin announced Monday he favors halting production of the B-2
now that the first 15 bombers in development. Bush wants to build
the fleet of 75.
   Aspin's Senate counterpart, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who favors
continued production, said afterwards, the B-2 ``has an uphill
fight if it's going to survive.''
   Aspin's committee is aimng to cut $24 billion from Bush's
request for $307 billion for the Pentagon for fiscal 1991.
   Fitzwater said Bush called the meeting to express concern about
``inordinate cuts.''
   Despite improved relations, the Soviet Union remains the United
States' adversary, said Fitzwater. He quoted Bush as saying,
``There have been few changes in Soviet strategic forces. ... They
are continuing to modernize their entire force, and will enter the
START negotiations fully modernized.''
   Cheney told the lawmakers that the House cuts would force the
Pentagon to absorb personnel cuts of 250,000 in the first year,
cutting back nearly four army divisions and 25 ships.
   ``We think that is unreasonable,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush said at a Strategic Air Command base in Cheyenne, Wyo.,
last Friday that he wanted ``to hold the line at the already
painful reduction of the defense budget set down by the Senate
Armed Services Committee.''
   That panel, chaired by Nunn, approved a $289 billion defense
bill last week that would cut nearly $1 billion from Bush's $4
billion Strategic Defense Initiative request and remove 100,000
troops from active duty, including 50,000 from Europe.
   Nunn said after the meeting, ``We can save some very substantial
sums over five years and do it prudently,'' trimming $180 billion
to $200 billion from defense.
   ``The first year we can save about 20 percent responsibly. ...''
Nunn said. ``Over five years we can save about 35 percent of that
total of $500 billion.''
   But if too much is cut the first year, ``you end up wrecking the
personnel system (and) demoralizing not only those who will be
forced out of the military ... but those who are left,'' Nunn
warned.

<TEXT>
   Government and rebel leaders of El
Salvador struggled to reach agreement on human rights issues on
Wednesday in an overtime session of their peace talks in this Costa
Rican capital.
   Talks began Friday and were to end Tuesday. When the two sides
got nowhere on the issue of reforming the military, however,
negotiators decided to move on to human rights in an attempt to
make some tangible progress.
   The main objective of the talks is to reach a cease-fire in the
decade-long civil war that has killed 72,000 people in the small
Central American country.
   Oscar Santamaria, the justice minister and chief of the
government delegation, said both sides are agreeable to U.N. human
rights monitoring.
   ``The position of the government is that there will be a state
institution that supervises human rights and that it will be
monitored by the United Nations,'' Santamaria told The Associated
Press.
   However, the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
wants the human rights commission to be run by the United Nations.
   ``Our position is that it should be a U.N. mission that oversees
human rights, because if it's the government's, that will take away
its effectiveness,'' rebel negotiator Schafik Handal, the senior
guerrilla commander, told the AP.
   In El Salvador, rebels took over a small, rural community to
explain to residents the status of the talks in Costa Rica.
   ``A man who looked like a peasant, with his M-16 on his
shoulder, told us that if there are no concrete agreements they
will launch another offensive on the capital, which could be worse
than the one on Nov. 11,'' said Jaime Tejada, a resident of San
Francisco Morazan, 45 miles north of the capital, San Salvador.
   The guerrillas talked of such an offensive before the
discussions began to pressure the government to negotiate changes
in the military.
   The November offensive was the largest in the history of the
war, claiming 2,000 lives.
   This is the third round of talks this year aimed at ending the
shooting.

<HEAD>Juan Corona Will Talk About Grisly Murders of 20 Years Ago,
Lawyers Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted mass murderer Juan Corona has
decided to admit at a parole board hearing that he hacked 25
migrant workers to death in 1971, his lawyer said Wednesday.
   ``He indicated that he is going to be willing to talk about
it,'' said Don Condren, who will represent Corona at his Aug. 1
parole hearing. ``At least he was when I spoke with him three weeks
ago.''
   Corona, 56, has spoken a little bit more openly about the crime
recently, Condren said in an interview from his home at Carmel
Valley, south of San Francisco. He refused to elaborate.
   Corona, a native of Mexico and a former farm labor contractor,
was convicted of mass murder in 1973. The remains of 25 people,
many of them immigrants, were unearthed from farm land near Yuba
City, 120 miles northeast of San Francisco. Most of the bodies
showed signs of mutilation and torture.
   Corona's first conviction was overturned in 1982 by an appeals
court, which ruled his defense had been inadequate. At his second
trial that year, he was again convicted of murder and sentenced to
25 years for each count.
   Mexican consular official Jesus Rodriguez Navarro testified at
Corona's second trial that in 1978 Corona had confessed to him,
saying ``I'm a sick man, and a sick man cannot be judged as the
rest of them.'' An appeals court later ruled the reported
confession should not have been accepted as evidence.
   Corona has never admitted to the killings in a public proceeding.
   He has been denied parole twice, in 1984 and 1987. Officials
based their last refusal on what the called ongoing mental
instability and the horrible nature of his crimes.
   Corona works in the cafeteria at Soledad prison and has attended
weekly meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for five years, said prison
spokesman Jerry Smith. But he rarely speaks during the meetings and
has lost interest in hobbies and reading, Condren said.
   ``Right now I don't think he's doing very much. A lot of people
down there, they vegetate,'' Condren said.
   Condren described his client as ``very, very polite,'' and
someone who no longer is a threat to society.
   Corona had hoped eventually to go to his mother's farm in
Mexico, but she died in April, Condren said.
   ``Now he has no real ambitions. No training. All he can do is
agricultural work. He feels like that's all he knows.''

   President Mikhail Gorbachev refused to open a
dialogue on the disputed Kuril islands during a meeting Wednesday
with the speaker of Japan's parliament, Tass reported.
   The group of islands, stretching north from the northern
Japanese island of Hokkaido, were seized by Soviet troops in the
final days of World War II, and the dispute has kept Japan and the
Soviet Union from signing a peace treaty to formally end the war.
   Yoshio Sakurauchi, speaker of the powerful lower house of
parliament, or Diet, said at the meeting Wednesday in the Kremlin
that it was his duty to raise the issue of the Kurils, Tass
reported.
   Gorbachev replied that no one in the Soviet Union would say it
holds the territory of other nations, according to Tass.
   ``All this is confirmed by postwar documents. It was a severe
war for all countries. International decisions were made on the
basis of the postwar realities and we abide by them,'' the official
news agency quoted him as saying.
   ``I do not want to launch a discussion today on the issue that
was repeatedly discussed with representatives of Japan,'' Gorbachev
said, according to Tass. ``I can repeat today: We do not have a
territorial issue.''
   Sakurauchi, who was leading a parliamentary delegation on a
visit to Moscow, said there was a ``new age'' in the Pacific
region, Tass reported, and he added: ``We are prepared to pay heed
to the Soviet public's view on all issues, but I think you, too,
should take into account the Japanese public's opinion.''
   The issue was raised during the June summit between Gorbachev
and President Bush, but the Soviet leader reportedly would not
budge.
   Bush has been quoted as saying he will continue to support
Japan's position in the dispute.
   Gorbachev told Sakurauchi he hoped for constructive dialogue on
other issues, Tass said.
   ``We favor good relations but, regrettably, they are not notable
for dynamics today,'' it quoted Gorbachev as saying. ``Possibly, we
will understand each other better with time.''

<HEAD>AWOL Intelligence Analysts Face Discipline</HEAD>

   Six soldiers charged with going AWOL from
their intelligence unit for what a friend described as a rendezvous
with UFOs could lose pay and rank under disciplinary terms offered
Wednesday by the Army.
   The six were reported missing from their units in Augsberg, West
Germany, on July 9 and arrested in Gulf Breeze, Fla., four days
later.
   They were offered the ``non-judicial punishment'' after an
investigation failed to find evidence of espionage, said Major Ron
Mazzia, a spokesman for Fort Knox, where they were being held.
   The soldiers were given three days to consider the proposed
disciplinary action and could later be discharged, Mazzia said.
   It was still unclear why the six, all from the 701st Military
Intelligence Brigade in Augsberg, traveled to Florida.
   Stan Johnson of Bybee, Tenn., said the oldest member of the
group, Specialist Kenneth G. Beason, 26, told him they had been
``chosen by ... divine intervention to help prepare for the end of
the world, which was supposed to occur in about eight years from
now. ...
   ``They were going to Florida to kick off preparations,'' said
Johnson, a friend of Beason's for several years who picked him up
at the Knoxville, Tenn., airport on arrival from Germany.
   ``The real interesting part of this,'' Johnson said, ``was that
when the second coming of Christ occurred, Jesus Christ was going
to arrive in a spaceship.''
   Gulf Breeze, a beach town near Pensacola where Beason and others
in the group received training, has been the site of many reported
UFO sightings.
   Besides Beason, those charged were identified as Pfc. Michael
Hueckstaedt, 19, of Farson, Wyo.; Pfc. Kris Perlock, 20, of
Osceola, Wis.; Pfc. William Setterberg, 20, of Pittsburgh;
Specialist Vance Davis, 25, of Valley Center, Kan.; and Sgt.
Annette Eccleston, 22, of Hartford, Conn.
   Capt. Kenneth Hicks of the Gulf Breeze police said that when he
questioned Hueckstaedt and Eccleston, neither spoke of religion or
UFOs.
   ``Really the only thing they said is they were heading out West
and they were just going to kind of live out in the woods _ kind of
like a survivalist group,'' Hicks said. They mentioned Santa Fe,
N.M., and Texas, he said.
   Mazzia said the soldiers were AWOL for varying amounts of time,
but the longest was seven days.
   The specific terms of the punishment, if they accept i, will be
determined by an officer acting almost as a sentencing judge. The
soldiers could lose pay or rank or both, and could be fined or
given extra duty, Mazzia said.
   As they have lost their top-security clearances, the soldiers
would have to be retrained for other Army assignments, Mazzia said.
   Instead, they could be discharged from the Army. But no
discharge recommendation could be made until after the disciplinary
action over the AWOL charges is complete, he said.

<HEAD>Southeast Farmers Look to More Rain to Help Drought-Stricken Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two weeks of rain helped save some of the
Southeast's parched soybean, cotton and peanut crops, but farm
experts warned that without more rain soon, disastrous losses are
still likely.
   The National Weather Service said significant rainfall for the
region is unlikely in the next two weeks, although spotty afternoon
and evening thundershowers will continue.
   Six weeks of hot, dry weather, with temperatures hovering around
100 degrees, destroyed corn in Georgia and North Carolina and
threatened peanuts and soybeans throughout the region.
   Soybeans are vital to farmers in Tennessee, and about half the
nation's peanuts are grown in Alabama and in Georgia, where they
are the main crop.
   Larry Snipes of the Georgia Agricultural Statistics Service said
crop conditions are improving after storms over the last two weeks
raised the month's rainfall totals to almost normal _ 4.08 inches.
In July, officials said parts of the state were 6 inches below
normal for the year.
   ``We're a lot more optimistic now than we were two weeks ago,''
said Carl Cross, a statistician for the North Carolina Department
of Agriculture. ``If we get normal precipitation for the remainder
of the season, we could still have some good crops before the end
of the season.''
   In North Carolina, June rainfall averaged about 3 inches below
normal, South Carolina was 2 to 5 inches below, and Tennessee had
accumulated a 9.14-inch shortage since Jan. 1.
   The rain came too late for corn. The Georgia Farm Bureau said
100 percent of the state's dry land corn crop was lost, and
irrigated production _ a tiny portion of the crop _ would be
reduced because of poor pollination and heat stress.
   Cross said that in North Carolina, corn also was in the early
stages of pollination when hot, dry weather arrived, causing
reduced yields and, in some areas, the loss of the entire crop.
   But in Tennessee, the wet spring may have saved corn from the
dry summer. Soggy conditions in April and May delayed the planting
period, meaning corn hadn't reached critical growth stages when the
dry spell began, said USDA statistician Ron Brantner.
   ``Had it been on schedule, we would have lost some corn yield,''
Brantner said. ``As it turned out, we did get some rains in time,
so the corn crop is looking about normal right now.''
   Much cotton and tobacco survived the baking temperatures, with
tobacco markets recording good opening prices. North Carolina is
predicting a record $1 billion crop.
   Peanuts _ Georgia's top crop at $500 million _ and soybeans were
helped by the rain, but they need more to survive critical blooming
and pegging stages.
   ``This is a critical state,'' Georgia Agricultural Commissioner
Tommy Irvin said. ``When the soil gets so hot, the peg comes out of
the vine and burns off instead of setting in the soil and (forming)
the nut.''
   In South Carolina, climatologist John Purvis said soybeans
``were suffering badly.''
   ``Hay is in bad shape, but the rain has helped prospects for
second or third crops,'' he added.
   Alabama crops have fared better than surrounding states, said
Joel Moore, a federal agriculture statistician in Montgomery.
Although a dry spell earlier this month threatened the state's
corn, with recent rain the crop now is classified as 52 percent
fair, 33 percent good and 12 percent excellent.

   As New Hampshire's attorney general,
Supreme Court nominee David Souter supported obscenity cases
against Penthouse magazine, its local distributor and a pharmacy
that sold its July 1976 ``Bisextennial'' issue.
   Court records show Souter's office successfully fought an
attempt by Penthouse and other defendants to quash the indictments
on jurisdictional grounds and also defended a state law that
included any touching of a person's buttocks in its definition of
sexual conduct.
   The Penthouse case was one of dozens the state argued before New
Hampshire's supreme court during Souter's two years as attorney
general. The records, reviewed Wednesday, show that Souter's office
supported a tough law-and-order approach and positions on evidence
rulings favorable to prosecutors.
   On another subject Wednesday, Concord Hospital said that in
February 1973 Souter was a member of the board of trustees that
voted to allow the hospital to perform abortions.
   The subject of abortion, perhaps the most emotional and divisive
the Supreme Court addresses each year, is expected to figure
prominently in senators' questioning of Souter at confirmation
hearings in September.
   Concord Hospital President Richard Warner had said Tuesday that
abortion never came before the board when Souter was a member and
later its president.
   But on Wednesday, Warner said through a spokeswoman that while
reviewing minutes of meetings held before he came to the hospital
in 1975 he came across the minutes of the 1973 meeting.
   Doctors had requested adoption of the policy statement because
of the month-old Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, Roe
vs. Wade. Included in the statement, and still in effect, was a
stipulation that hospital employees could refuse to assist with
abortions.
   Dean Williamson, who was among the 45 trustees at the time, said
Wednesday he recalls only a brief discussion of the issue and said
he believed it was adopted on a voice vote without dissent.
   ``I don't recall any emotional debate,'' he said. Williamson
said he had no recollection of Souter speaking on the issue.
   Another trustee, Marily Wilson, also said she could not recall
Souter speaking.
   ``This was a medical procedure vote, not a social issues vote,''
she said. ``It was not over he rights or wrongs of abortion but
rather about our responsibility as a medical facility in light of
the law.''
   On another issue Wednesday, The Union Leader in Manchester
reported that in a 1976 college commencement speech, Souter, then
state attorney general, attacked rigid federal affirmative action
guidelines as ``affirmative discrimination'' and added, ``There are
some things government cannot do.''
   As for the Penthouse issue, the obscenity case was brought by a
county prosecutor against Penthouse International, its New
Hampshire distributor and a Manchester pharmacy.
   Penthouse and the pharmacy challenged the indictment on grounds
the state had no jurisdiction to charge them because their parent
corporations were not based in New Hampshire. The distributor,
Manchester News, mounted a separate challenge on grounds the
state's obscenity law was unconstitutional.
   The trial judge rejected those challenges and his rulings were
appealed to the state supreme court where, by law, the attorney
general represents county prosecutors in all appeals.
   Souter was listed on the state briefs in the high court cases.
He did not personally argue the cases but approved the positions
taken by his office.
   The court refused to throw out charges against Manchester News
but did declare unconstitutional the portion of the state obscenity
law that included ``any touching of the genitals, pubic areas or
buttocks of the male or female or the breasts of the female'' in
its definition of sexual conduct.
   Souter's office had filed a legal brief supporting that law.
   In the end, charges were brought to trial only against
Penthouse, and the trial ended in a deadlocked jury.
   A quick review of the cases Souter's office argued before the
New Hampshire Supreme Court turned up none that he argued
personally. But the positions taken by the office were endorsed by
him and often mirrored approaches he took later as a judge on the
state's Superior and Supreme Court.
   Among the cases were:
   _Successful opposition by Souter's office to an appeal of an
assault conviction by a man who argued that graphic slides showing
the 16-month-old victim's injuries were too prejudicial to be
allowed as evidence.
   _A successful argument by Souter's office that a murder
conviction should not be overturned on grounds prosecutors failed
to tell the defense the state had promised the key prosecution
witness a new name after the trial.
   _Successful defense of state laws setting mandatory sentences of
life without parole. In one 1978 case, two convicts had challenged
the laws on grounds that he state Legislature lacked the authority
to pass them and that such penalties amounted to cruel and unusual
punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.
   _An unsuccessful attempt to bring state charges to trial against
a man who had been acquitted of federal bank robbery charges after
two hung juries. The high court said the state attempt amounted to
double jeopardy.
   _A lost appeal in a case in which two men committed to
psychiatric facilities after being charged with sex offenses
challenged judges' orders extending their commitments. Souter's
office argued such findings were sufficient to keep the men in the
institutions, but the court ruled the state needed to prove the men
posed a danger to society.

   The Coast Guard dismissed charges of
drunkenness and misconduct against Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood on Wednesday, but suspended his license as a ship's
master.
   At an administrative hearing, Hazelwood pleaded no contest to
two allegations stemming from the wreck of the tanker, which
unleashed the nation's worst oil spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound.
   The plea that resulted in a nine-month license suspension
covered two allegations: that he violated Coast Guard policy by
drinking liquor less than four hours before taking command of the
Exxon Valdez, and that he improperly leaft the vessel's bridge
while it was headed for jagged Bligh Reef.
   The Coast Guard dismissed a charge that Hazelwood was
intoxicated, with a blood alcohol level over 0.04 percent, the
Coast Guard standard for operating a vessel. Also dismissed was a
charge that he left an improperly licensed third mate in control of
the ship.
   The Coast Guard proceeding was administrative rather than
criminal; the only penalty that could be imposed involved
Hazelwood's license.
   During arguments, Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos,
disclosed that the defense recently obtained documents indicating
that the blood alcohol test taken 10{ hours after the spill was
mishandled and unreliable.
   ``We now know that the alcohol test was invalid at best and
bogus at worst,'' Chalos told the judge. ``This man should never
have been put through this ordeal.''
   The 987-foot tanker's hull was ripped open when it plowed into
the reef the night of March 24, 1989, spilling nearly 11 millions
of Alaska crude into Prince William Sound in the nation's worst oil
spill.
   Hazelwood, of Huntington, N.Y., was previously acquitted of
intoxication charges by the Alaska jury, which also found him
innocent of recklessness but convicted him on a misdemeanor of
negligently discharging oil.
   He was ordered to pay $50,000 restitution and spend 1,000 hours
cleaning beaches at Prince William Sound. He is appealing.
   At the time of the accident, the Exxon Valdez was en route from
the Alaskan port of Valdez to Long Beach when it struck the charted
reef. Long Beach also is headquarters of the 11th Coast Guard
District, which includes Alaska.
   At the Coast Guard hearing, Administrative Law Judge Harry
Gardner suspended Hazelwood's master's license for 12 months, but
reduced that by three months because the license, issued in 1966,
has been held by the Coast Guard since the accident.
   Gardner told Hazelwood it was his duty to remain on the bridge
of the Exxon Valdez until it had finished a crossing into Prince
William Sound.
   ``It is difficult to understand why you were not on the bridge
until you executed the turn,'' the judge said. ``I'm sure you have
agonized over this during the last 16 months and I agree with your
counsel that you have been through quite an ordeal. Hopefully this
will make you an even better master in the future.''
   Gardner said he concluded the grounding of the Exxon Valdez was
the result of human error, citing the actions of the third mate and
the helmsman who were on the bridge when the accident occurred.
They have not been charged with violations.
   Hazelwood, 43, left the Coast Guard headquarters looking solemn.
He said, ``I'm just glad this portion is over.'' He was engulfed in
a crowd of reporters and camera crews as he left.
   His attorneys contended the newly found blood-test documents
raised doubts that the blood tested was Hazelwood's.
   The documents showed that the Sacramento laboratory which tested
the blood received three 10-millimeter tubes of blood with red
stoppers.
   This report conflicted with testimony in National Transportation
Safety Board hearings by the Coast Guard officer who took the
blood. The officer said it was placed in three tubes, but only one
had a red stopper _ the others were gray.
   To complicate matters, the defense got the laboratory's own copy
of the document three days ago, and found it had been altered to
conform to the NTSB hearing testimony.
   Another Hazelwood lawyer, Thomas Russo, said gray-stoppered
tubes ones held blood with a chemical preservative to prevent it
from fermenting and producing its own alcohol. The red-stoppered
tubes hold blood without the preservative and are used for tests of
drugs, but not alcohol.
   ``It's what we said all along and nobody would listen to us,''
Hazelwood said after the hearing. ``The possible skullduggery that
goes along with it is enough to make anybody angry.
   A receptionist at ChemWest Analytical Laboratories in
Sacramento, where the sample was analyzed, said Wednesday she was
told to tell reporters her company would have no comment and
referred all questions to the Coast Guard.
   Chalos and and Russo, said they believed the tardy disclosure of
the alcohol records constituted misconduct by both the Coast Guard
and the National Transportation Safety Board, which had access to
the documents.
   Chalos and Russo said the papers were wrongly withheld from them
before Hazelwood's criminal trial in Alaska.
   ``We had no actual physical control of any of the toxicological
specimens,'' the NTSB said in a statement released Wednesday. It
said the two laboratories which tested the blood were certified
under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the
results provided the NTSB ``were identified as those of Capt.
Joseph Hazelwood.''
   At a news conference, Cmdr. Chris Desmond insisted that the
Coast Guard did not drop the alcohol charge against Hazelwood
because of the conflict over blood evidence.
   ``I want you to understand that the Coast Guard was above-board
in these proceedings,'' he said. The agency was not aware of the
conflicting documents until their agreement with Hazelwood had
already been finalized, he said.
   But Russo followed Desmond and said, ``The Coast Guard position
regarding Capt. Hazelwood was rather stern until this information
was disclosed. I think the Coast Guard dropped the intoxication
charge because they knew they could not prove the intoxication
charge.''

   The U.S. Navy has called off an
unsuccessful, 12-hour search for an attack bomber and its crew who
crashed in the South China Sea, a military spokesman said Thursday.
The pilot and navigator were presumed dead.
   The Grumman A-6E Intruder from the aircraft carrier Independence
crashed Tuesday almost 400 miles southwest of Subic Bay naval base
while on a night flying operation, said spokesman Lt. Lee Saunders
of the 7th Fleet. Subic lies about 50 miles west of Manila.
   Planes and helicopters from the Independence, the destroyer
Goldsborough and the frigate Reasoner joined in the search.
   Howard Thomas, a spokesman for Whidbey Island Naval Air Station
in Washington state, identified the missing pilot as Lt. Cmdr.
Jeffrey Mines, 35, of North Bend, Neb.; and the navigator as Lt.
Cmdr. Arthur Braun, 37, of Georgetown, Texas. The plane was based
at the air station north of Seattle.

   Marlon Brando's son apparently lost his
passport, which must be surrendered to authorities before his
release from jail on $10 million bail, his lawyer said Wednesday.
   Judge Larry Fidler on Tuesday ordered the 32-year-old Brando to
stand trial for murder in the shooting of his half-sister's
boyfriend. The judge also set bail at $10 million, believed the
highest in county history, and said the passport must be
surrendered.
   ``We have been unable to locate the passport of Christian Brando
and without it he cannot be released,'' defense attorney Robert
Shapiro said. ``Attempts are still being made to locate it.''
   Shapiro declined comment on whether the elder Brando had made
the $10 million bail. But a bondsman for Bert Potter Bail Bonds
said the bail was ready, once the passport turned up.
   Christian Brando faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of
the murder of Dag Drollet, 26, who was shot with a .45-caliber
pistol on May 16 at the elder Brando's home. Arraignment was set
for Aug. 7.
   Police allege Christian Brando shot Drollet during an argument
about Brando's accusation Drollet had beaten his sister.
   The younger Brando also is charged with illegal possession of a
machine gun, found when police searched the home.

   District Attorney Harry Connick was acquitted
Wednesday of gambling and racketeering charges arising from his
return of gambling records to a convicted bookmaker.
   Actor Paul Burke, former assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fanning
and New Orleans businessman Wilson Abraham also were acquitted of
all charges.
   All three were charged with racketeering by conducting an
illegal gambling enterprise and aiding and abetting a gambling
operation. Burke also was charged with perjury.
   The accused bookmaker, Walton Aucoin, and two of his employees,
Steve Bertolino and William Condon, were convicted on two counts
each of gambling and racketeering.
   Connick, the father of Grammy-winning jazz musician Harry
Connick Jr, sat quietly, rubbed his teary eyes and folded his hands
after the verdict was announced. Several supporters cried, as did
one juror.
   ``I feel fine,'' Connick told reporters outside the courthouse.
   ``There were no thoughts going through my mind, just feelings,''
said Burke, star of TV's ``The Naked City.'' ``It was like Roman
candles going off...I just thank God we have a court system.''
   Even before the federal jury returned its innocent verdict,
Connick confidently filed qualifying papers Wednesday for a fall
election.
   ``I'm ready to campaign,'' Connick said. ``We've been at this a
long time and I'm ready for this to be over.''
   The U.S. District Court trial lasted six weeks.
   The indictment alleged that Connick responded to the urgings of
Burke, Fanning and Abraham and illegally returned seized records to
Aucoin so the admitted bookie could pay off and collect gambling
debts. Aucoin, Bertolino and Condon were accused of running an
illegal gambling operation.
   Connick maintained that Aucoin was entitled to have his gambling
records returned under state law. Aucoin said he needed them to pay
federal income taxes.
   Prosecutors said those were merely excuses cooked up by Fanning,
Burke and Abraham to help Connick justify the return of the records.
   The perjury charge against Burke stemmed from testimony he gave
before a grand jury.
   James Cole, of the Justice Department in Washington, said the
timing of the return _ just five days after Aucoin was arrested on
Dec. 4, 1988 _ was the key to the case. Prosecutors said it would
ordinarily take four to six weeks for the records to be returned.
   The indictment was handed up in December after a year-long
investigation begun by U.S. Attorney John Volz.
   Connick and Volz had sparred for years over various issues and
Volz later turned the case over to the Justice Department to avoid
any appearance of bias.
   However, Connick always characterized the charges as part of a
political vendetta, which Cole denied.
   ``I think the evidence that we had warranted the bringing of the
case,'' Cole said. ``The decision to bring this case was made by
the public integrity section of the Department of Justice .. The
U.S. Attorney's office had no part in the decision of whether or
not to prosecute this case.''
   Fanning, once an assistant to Volz, was Aucoin's lawyer at the
time of the 1988 arrest. Burke was an acquaintance of Connick and
Aucoin, as was Abraham, a contributor to Connick's political
campaigns.
   Connick, 63, has been district attorney since 1974.
   The investigation also involved former Gov. Edwin Edwards and a
suburban sheriff, Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish, although neither
man was indicted.
   Lee testified in the trial that he once returned gambling
records to Aucoin after an arrest and Edwards was widely reported
to have called Lee on Aucoin's behalf to urge return of those
records.

<TEXT>
   The most frequent of suspects in murder
mysteries, the butler, didn't do it this time.
   It was the maid, and for solving the ``murder mystery'' on a
train from Chicago to New York, Larry Wall won a ride Wednesday on
the storied Orient Express and a chance to win the international
competition for CLUE, the board game.
   Wall, who calls himself the most ardent of Agatha Christie's
fans, stands crowned as the first-ever national CLUE champion.
   ``The hardest thing to do is getting rid of the clues that don't
mean anything and then if you look at what's left, you can solve
it,'' said Wall, surrounded by actors who portrayed characters such
as Professor Plum, Col. Mustard and Miss Scarlett from the Parker
Brothers' detective game.
   The traveling CLUE contest began in Chicago Tuesday when the
contestant-detectives investigated the ``murder'' of a Mr. Boddy at
Union Station. Later, aboard the train, another character,
Professor Plum, met an untimely death.
   The cast of characters and five amateur sleuths arrived at New
York's Penn Station after a day-long mystery ride aboard the
luxurious American-European Express train from Chicago.
   While on board, Wall and the other detectives quizzed the
characters, sifted clues from a scavenger hunt in Chicago and kept
their theories to themselves.
   Wall, the owner of an electronics company, said he heard about
the contest through another interactive murder mystery game he had
attended.
   ``When I heard there was a chance to get on the Orient Express,
obviously, I was very excited,'' said Wall, of Winston-Salem, N.C.
He said he has won two similar contests.
   For the record, Mrs. White ``killed'' Boddy and Plum to avenge a
deceitful act from 15 years ago. Boddy, aided by Professor Plum,
had forced a company owned by Mrs. White's father into bankruptcy.
   After the contestants submitted their theories on the Boddy
murder and its motivation, the actors played the final scene, in
which the maid revealed herself as Mrs. White and entered the stage
with a gun in her hand.
   ``I came out no longer the maid but as Mrs. White,'' said
actress Susan Tabor, who played the character. ``I said, `Get out
of my way, this gun is a small gun but it shoots big bullets.' And
then I got shot. So I'm dead.'''
   And so begins another mystery: ``The Case of the Talking
Corpse.''

<HEAD>Investigator Says NRC Staff Misled Commission on Pilgrim Emergency
Plans</HEAD>

   Staff members of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission staffers gave the commission inaccurate information in
declaring that residents near the Pilgrim nuclear power plant in
Plymouth, Mass. could be protected in an emergency, an investigator
reported Wednesday.
   In a scathing 15-page report, the commission's inspector general
concluded that the commission's staff said Pilgrim was safe to
operate without looking in detail at evacuation plans. The report
accused staffers of relying on unconfirmed information provided by
the plant owner, Boston Edison Co.
   It said the commission's rush to approve the reopening of the
plant in December 1988 after a three-year shutdown was a key motive
behind the sloppy staff work.
   The report by Inspector General David C. Williams comes more
than a year after the commission allowed the formerly troubled
plant to restart. Williams said staffers were ``inaccurate'' and
provided information to the commission which was ``neither balanced
nor thorough.''
   ``The NRC staff's assessment of off-site emergency preparedness
at Pilgrim was neither balanced nor thorough,'' Williams wrote.
``The staff conducted little firsthand review of off-site emergency
preparedness at the local level and had minimal contact with local
officials who had the primary responsibility for developing
off-site emergency plans and procedures.
   ``Instead, NRC staff relied on information obtained from the
Boston Edison Company... We believe that in light of BECO's vested
interest in restarting Pilgrim, BECO was not the best source for
the NRC staff to rely on for information on the status of off-site
emergency preparedness.''
   The staff disputed Williams' findings in a written response,
arguing that it met frequently with local officials on emergency
plans prior to two crucial commission meetings in October and
December 1988.
   In a reply to the reply, Williams wrote that there were 31
meetings with local officials, but, ``They did not involve a
meaningful dialogue with local emergency planning officials.''
   Commission Chairman Kenneth Carr issued a terse two-sentence
statement noting that staff members had asked to recommend what
further actions are necessary and that ``We will continue to follow
the matter closely.''
   As examples of the staff's work, Williams noted that staff
members reported that:
   _They had toured the 10-mile radius emergency planning zone
around Pilgrim with a ``special emphasis'' on beaches. In fact,
only one tour of Duxbury Beach in Duxbury, Mass., and Saquish Beach
in Plymouth was conducted.
   _No one remained at Saquish Beach overnight, neglecting to
mention that there are several hundred homes on the beach, some of
which are occupied around the clock.
   _The summer population of Saquish was less than 700. ``The NRC
staff did not recall the source of this population figure,''
Williams notes. And it was only in February 1989, after the plant
resumed operation, that the staff acknowledged that the population
in summer could reach as high as 5,000.

   Confidence in the national economy and

News-Money Magazine poll released on Wednesday.
   Seventy-one percent of the 1,032 people contacted for the survey
said they thought the economy was in not-so-good or poor shape,
according to results released by the network. The same number
thought it was a bad time to make a purchase.
   The poll said this was the worst showing ever, but did not give
comparisons from the past
   On personal finance, 49 percent rated their own as not-so-good
or poor, the poll said. This was a single percentage point shy of
the previous worst showing, 50 percent on an unspecified date in
early 1986.
   The poll was completed last Sunday and has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

   The Broadway production of the London hit ``Miss
Saigon'' may be postponed because of complaints the English star, a
Caucasian, is being brought over to play the role of a Eurasian.
   Producer Cameron Mackintosh said Wednesday that unless Actors'
Equity, the U.S. union, drops its opposition to lead actor Jonathan
Pryce within two weeks, the play would be withdrawn.
   The union met Tuesday but failed to resolve the issue of whether
Pryce, who plays a Eurasian brothel owner, will be permitted to
perform in the American version of the musical. It will meet again,
but the date for a new meeting has yet to be set.
   ``Unless Equity changes its position within the next two weeks,
I will have no choice but to withdraw the production,'' Mackintosh
said. ``This is because any interruption in our current production
schedule would leave us with insufficient time to prepare this huge
and complicated show for a March 1991 opening.''
   The earliest ``Miss Saigon'' could be rescheduled is autumn 1992
because of ``all of the other professional commitments of our
creative team,'' Mackintosh said.
   The controversy arose after a complaint was filed with Equity by
David Henry Hwang, author of ``M. Butterfly,'' and B.D. Wong, star
of the same play. They were critical of the casting of Pryce, a
Caucasian, in the musical, which is set in Saigon during the
Vietnam War.
   In a letter to Equity President Colleen Dewhurst, Wong wrote,
``There is no doubt in my mind of the irreparable damage to my
rights as an actor that would be wrought if ... Asian actors are
kept from bringing their unique dignity to the specifically Asian
roles in `Miss Saigon' and therefore to all racially specific roles
in every future production which will look to the precedent `Miss
Saigon' is about to set as a concrete model.''
   In London, Pryce won the Olivier Award as best actor in a
musical for his performance in ``Miss Saigon.'' He has starred on
Broadway before, winning praise for his performances in Trevor
Griffiths' `Comedians'' in 1976 and in Dario Fo's ``Accidental
Death of an Anarchist'' in 1984.
   ``I once again reaffirm our intention to look for Eurasian
replacements and understudies, as well as actors to originate the
role in other companies,'' Mackintosh wrote in a letter to Alan
Eisenberg, an official of Actors' Equity, about Pryce. ``As our
worldwide efforts to date have proved unsuccessful, I would
earnestly request that any candidates from among your membership
who are in the right age group (40-45 years old), who are high
baritones-tenors with an A flat top and who are of a `star
performance caliber' immediately contact Vinnie Liff of
Johnson-Liff &amp; Zerman Casting, with their credentials.''
   ``Miss Saigon'' is one of the most eagerly awaited shows of
1990-91 Broadway season. The musical already has a $24 million
advance, the largest in Broadway history. It will also have the
highest top ticket price for a Broadway musical _ $100 for selected
seats in the mezzanine.

   The Philippines, strapped for funds
after last week's devastating earthquake, will appeal to foreign
creditors to relax their terms, officials said Wednesday.
   The move by the Cabinet was an effort to head off a push by some
lawmakers to freeze payments on the nation's $26 billion foreign
debt in order to finance reconstruction in the wake of the July 16
quake.
   According to the latest figures, at least 1,653 people were
killed, more than 3,000 seriously injured and nearly 90,000 people
left homeless by the quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter
scale. More than 1,000 people were listed as missing and feared
dead.
   Torrential rains forced the suspension Wednesday of flights of
relief goods to northern Luzon island, where hundreds were feared
still trapped by landslides triggered by the quake.
   Also Wednesday, the Senate approved President Corazon Aquino's
request for $500 million in emergency funds for earthquake relief
and reconstruction. The measure, already approved by the House of
Representatives, is expected to be signed by Mrs. Aquino on
Thursday.
   The Cabinet's decision to appeal for new debt-repayment terms
came a day after the House of Representatives approved a
non-binding resolution urging a 2{-year freeze on payments.
   The measure goes to the Senate, which had been urging a
unilateral reduction of debt payments even before the quake. Mrs.
Aquino has opposed any such unilateral moves.
   Finance Secretary Jesus Estanislao said Mrs. Aquino would seek
to ease terms of payments ``on a temporary basis,'' and would
negotiate any changes with the creditors.
   ``Nothing will be unilateral,'' he said.
   In another development, 17 of the 23 members of the Senate urged
Mrs. Aquino to seek a nationwide cease-fire with Communist, Moslem
and right-wing military rebels in a gesture of unity following the
quake.
   Both the Communist New People's Army and the dissident military
Reform the Armed Forces Movement proposed a temporary truce, but
the government rejected both offers.
   The heavy rains prompted Mrs. Aquino to cancel a planned visit
to quake-devastated Nueva Vizcaya province. Mrs. Aquino has visited
most areas hardest hit by the quake except for the northern
province of La Union, a stronghold of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Presidential staffers denied Mrs. Aquino was avoiding the
province because of political considerations, but did not disclose
any plans to visit La Union.
   In New York, a lawyer for Imelda Marcos said the former first
lady has offered to donate about $5 million for earthquake relief.
But first the Manila government and U.S. officials would have to
agree to release funds frozen by court order.
   Attorney James Linn said the offer was made several days ago and
``we're waiting for an answer from Manila.''
   On July 2, a federal court jury in New York acquitted Mrs.
Marcos of racketeering, fraud and obstructing justice in connection
with the alleged theft of more than $220 million from the
Philippines treasury during Marcos' 20 years in power.
   The Aquino government is still attempting to recover the money
in a series of civil lawsuits in the United States and Switzerland.

<TEXT>
   The $6.6 billion Seabrook nuclear power
plant was dedicated Wednesday in a ceremony attended by 700 fans,
including figures key to pushing completion of the plant at times
when it seemed doomed.
   ``I'm proud to say that behind us right now, Seabrook Station is
at 100 percent power, generating the electricity that so many
people have worked so hard to produce,'' Ted Feigenbaum, vice
president of plant operator New Hampshire Yankee, told the guests.
   High-profile figures in Seabrook's 22-year history said holding
on to their dream of a nuclear power plant in New Hampshire was
well worth it.
   ``We couldn't give up,'' said former Gov. Meldrim Thomson. ``Why
not? We need the energy.''
   Thomson, who ordered the jailing of protesters during May 1977
demonstrations, said he was happy to see the plant reach 100
percent power, though at ``an almost prohibitive cost.''
   A handful of plant foes gathered outside the gates. ``We will be
a presence here,'' said Dianne Dunfey of the Clamshell Alliance.
The alliance at times drew thousands of demonstrators to the site.
   In his dedication speech, New Hampshire Yankee President Ed
Brown praised Bill Derrickson, who was key to saving the plant
after being hired as construction chief in 1984.
   Construction began in 1976 under Thomson and was finished in
1986, but Seabrook did not receive its Nuclear Regulatory
Commission license until March, two years after Seabrook's lead
owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, filed for
bankruptcy.
   ``In the nuclear world _ in the licensing process _ you're
guilty until you prove your innocence. And to do that, it takes a
long time,'' said Derrickson.
   Licensing delays, cost overruns and heavy borrowing at high
interest to pay for Seabrook forced Public Service's bankruptcy.
Its reorganization by Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities
includes a rate agreement that will hike electricity rates 5.5
percent a year for seven years.

<TEXT>
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former
Republican U.S. senator running for governor as an independent,
cleared the first hurdle in his bid Wednesday by filing more than
105,000 petition signatures.
   That is ten times the number he needed to get his name on the
November ballot.
   He submitted the signatures to the secretary of the state's
office after giving a fiery, populist speech to about 250
supporters gathered on the lawn of the state Capitol.
   ``Simply put, the people of the state of Connecticut are saying
to the Republicans and the Democrats ... enough,'' he said. ``This
time it's our turn.''
   Known during his three terms in the Senate as a liberal
Republican, a maverick and a loner, Weicker lost narrowly in 1988
to Democrat Joseph Lieberman. Weicker, 59, came out of a brief
political retirement in March to seek the governor's office as an
independent.
   Under state law, Weicker needed just 9,937 nominating
signatures, equal to 1 percent of the voters who cast ballots in
the 1986 gubernatorial election.
   He is running as a member of ``A Connecticut Party,'' a name
chosen partly to ensure that his name will appear first after the
two major parties.
   Every poll since March has showed Weicker holding a large lead
in three-way matches against Republican U.S. Rep. John Rowland of
Waterbury and Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden.
   Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, a two-term incumbent
battered by tax increases and the state's weakening economy,
dropped his bid for re-election three weeks after Weicker entered
the campaign.

   ABC News, seeking new overseas markets for its
programs, said Wednesday it has been showing European broadcasters
``Nightline'' and will do the same with four more programs,
including ``World News Tonight.''
   The programs are being sent via satellite to cable and TV
companies in 23 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, including
Rupert Murdoch's new Sky Television direct broadcast satellite
based in London, ABC said.
   Once the European television officials have had a chance to look
at ABC's programs, the network's executives will hold discussions
with the companies interested in carrying the programs, an ABC News
spokesman said.
   The evening newscasts of NBC and CBS and ABC's ``Nightline''
already are carried in some overseas markets, including Japan.
   However, the top-rated ``World News Tonight'' isn't yet
broadcast overseas, said the ABC spokesman, Scott Richardson.
   The new satellite transmission of ``Nightline'' to European
broadcasters began on July 2. The other four programs will be shown
during the next few months, but no schedule for their transmission
has been set yet.
   In addition to ``World News Tonight,'' the programs are ``This
Week with David Brinkley,'' ``The Health Show'' and ``Business
World.''
   ABC's move is the latest of recent efforts by all three U.S.
network news divisions to find new markets and revenues at a time
the networks are losing audiences to cable and other viewing
alternatives.
   According to CBS, Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' is seen in
France, Italy and Japan. Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' is
carried in Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom
and Spain, NBC says.
   In addition to Japan, ABC's ``Nightline'' is carried by
broadcasters in New Zealand and Australia, and talks are underway
to have it shown in Italy and in Taiwan, according to a spokeswoman
for the program.
   Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network, an early entry in the
global news market, is seen in 90 countries, according to CNN.

   A Gaithersburg woman Wednesday began
serving a 15-day jail sentence imposed for failing to pay a fine
levied against her for harassing hunters.
   Heidi Prescott, 28, was placed in the Montgomery County jail in
Rockville shortly after receiving the sentence from District Judge
Edwin Collier in Gaithersburg.
   She was jailed for refusing to pay a $500 fine she received on
conviction April 5 for interfering with deer hunters last year.
   The Fund for Animals Inc. believes Ms. Prescott is the first
person jailed on such a charge, said Wayne Pacelle, the group's
national director.
   Ms. Prescott, a staff member of the fund, and 13 others were
charged with talking to hunters and rustling leaves with their feet
during a demonstration at the McKee-Beshers Wildlife Management
Area near Poolesville on Nov. 25, the opening day of deer season.
   Eleven were convicted and charges against the remaining three
were dropped. All but Ms. Prescott paid fines and appealed their
convictions.

   ``We're anxiously following this, and if it's true it would be

afflicts about 4 million Americans.
   The finding surprised most researchers studying the disease's

   Vincent van Gogh cut off his ear and later killed
himself because of a painful but undiagnosed inner-ear infection,
not madness, a report published today suggests.
   The artist, who committed suicide 100 years ago Sunday at age
37, suffered from Meniere's disease, an often misdiagnosed
infection, Dr. I. Kaufman Arenberg said in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The disease, which afflicts about 7 million Americans, is
brought on by excess fluid and pressure in the ear and can cause
severe bouts of vertigo and hallucinations.
   Van Gogh, who sold just one painting during his life but whose
work now commands record prices, described those symptoms in
letters to family members, Arenberg and colleagues reported.

   The new summertime movie thriller,
``Arachnophobia,'' is bugging Dr. Michael H. Robinson, a spider
expert who accuses Hollywood of spinning a web of deceit about his
favorite creepy-crawly.
   ``It's a pity to give spiders a bad name,'' says Robinson,
director of the National Zoo and former director of the American
Arachnological Society. ``It's very sad that we should be so
irrational about them and see movies that reinforce all those
ancient, primitive fears about spiders.''
   Robinson, an English-born biologist, spent 20 years studying
spiders in Panama, Papua New Guinea and more than a dozen other
tropical countries. He was outraged when he saw a newspaper
advertisement for the Steven Spielberg-Frank Marshall movie about a
monstrous vampire spider that terrorizes a California family.
   ``Eight legs, two fangs and an attitude,'' the ad reads. It's
``Jaws with legs,'' warns one film critic.

   Death squads hired to rid the
slums of crime are killing growing numbers of street children,
often with the help of police, human rights activists say.
   Officials who monitor child abuse say hundreds of deprived,
destitute minors are murdered every year in Brazil.
   Police illegally arrest, torture and rape street children, the
advocacy group Amnesty International said in a report.
   Death squads, generally made up of off-duty or retired policemen
fed up with impotent courts and turnstile justice, have operated in
Brazil since the 1960s, when they killed known or suspected
criminals and opponents of the military regime.
   Human rights advocates are alarmed by the surge in killings of
young people, particularly in Sao Paulo, Rio and Recife.
   ``The violence has never been this bad,'' said Rodrigo Sousa
Filho, coordinator of the National Street Children's Movement in
Rio de Janeiro state. ``Kids are being gunned down without
question, as if they were wild dogs.''
   Grinding poverty, family disintegration and police corruption
contribute to the increasing brutality during Brazil's worst
economic crisis.
   Four-digit inflation, a foreign debt of $114 billion and cuts in
social spending have left the educational and child welfare systems
``functioning as revolving doors,'' Sousa Filho said.
   A study by the U.N. Children's Fund released in March said half
the 60 million children in Brazil suffer abject poverty and about
12 million fend for themselves on the streets, up from 5 million in
1985.
   Children as young as 5 are on the street, said Pedro Menezes,
spokesman for the Central Foundation for Infants and Adolescents, a
child welfare agency.
   Poorly equipped, low-security juvenile detention centers release
many children for lack of room, and others run away.
   Street kids become beggars or petty thieves to survive, Menezes
said, ``but they soon learn they can triple their parents' monthly
salary by running drugs or joining organized crime groups.''
   Since no one under 18 can be tried in Brazil, the children
become useful to crime bosses. Menezes said teen-agers help in
kidnappings, bank robberies and cocaine deals.
   Store owners pay death squads to wipe out criminals of all ages
in their areas.
   Children who are petty thieves are slain for as little as $40
each, but killing a youth who runs drugs or leads a slum gang can
cost up to $500, a policeman said, on condition of anonymity.
   Racial prejudice also comes into it. A study by the Brazilian
Institute of Social and Economic Analysis said 82 percent of street
kids murdered by death squads were black or of mixed race.
   ``If a street kid is white, he's seen as cute and is pitied, but
a black child is immediately thought to be a thief, a drug runner
or a gang leader,'' said Paulo Rios of the Brazilian League for the
Defense of Human Rights.
   Several studies show violence against minors is spreading across
this huge nation of 150 million people.
   One by the Health Ministry revealed an increase in killings of
young people in Sao Paulo from 280 in 1980 to 1,880 in 1989. In
Rio, violent deaths of young people rose from 287 in 1983 to 630 in
1989.
   Figures compiled by the National Movement for Street Boys and
Girls, which counsels abandoned children, indicate 333 street kids
were killed by death squads last year in Recife, Sao Paulo and Rio.
   Gilberto Dimenstein, an investigative reporter from Sao Paulo
who interviewed 300 street children in six cities, estimates the
death toll among them in all of Brazil is at least one a day.
   In his book ``The War of the Children,'' Dimenstein says street
children often are killed for witnessing crimes committed by
mobsters or police in violent neighborhoods. The practice is called
``burning the files.''
   Dimenstein writes of finding a youth slumped on a street corner
in Recife, a northeastern city, and asking the boy if he is sick.
   The response: ``No. I took a bullet in my leg. The bullet is
still in there.''
   ``Why don't you go to the hospital?''
   ``I am afraid the police will find me.''
   Police routinely torture street kids for information on crime
gangs and extort money from them as the price of leaving them
alone, said Dr. Maria Alda, coordinator of the National Movement
for Street Boys and Girls in Sao Paulo.
   Police officials deny the charges.
   ``More minors are committing felonies than ever before, `` said
Lt. Eide Trindade, director of Rio's task force on organized crime.
``If they are to engage in crimes such as armed robbery, they must
be treated by the same standards as adults. To stop the crime,
there is no other way.''
   In most cases involving torture or death, no one is arrested,
Alda said. Convictions of death squad members are next to
impossible because witnesses are threatened and sometimes killed.
   ``Everyone in these poor areas knows who's pulling the
trigger,'' Alda said, ``but no one, not even the kids, says
anything, out of sheer terror.''
   Last year, state troopers routinely picked up children who
begged around Rio's tourist beaches and dumped them in the slums of
the distant North Zone.
   Liborni Siqueira, one of only two juvenile court judges in this
city of 5.5 million, ordered military police in April to round up
street kids and put them in detention centers.
   Television news showed scantily clad, crying children huddled in
cramped, filthy cells. The order was withdrawn because of outcries
from politicians and human rights groups.
   Human rights activists denounced several incidents in which
children as young as 10 were put into overcrowded cells with
hardened adult criminals.
   Sousa Filho said prison guards routinely beat children with
clubs, burn their sex organs with cigarettes and dunk their heads
in toilets as punishment.
   A 12-year-old girl accused of killing a neighbor was locked in a
dark, 5-by-4-foot cell, alone and naked, for three days without
food, he said, and added:
   ``Just when I think I've come across the most barbaric case of
all, another one even more disgusting comes along.''

<HEAD>Foreign Businessmen Optimistic About Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While hordes of people seek foreign passports
as insurance before China takes over, a Japanese businessman
announces that his latest acquisition is an identification card
issued to Hong Kong residents.
   Kazuo Wada got the green, wallet-sized card this spring when he
and his Yaohan International, a $1.6 billion retailing giant, moved
its headquarters from Japan to the British crown colony.
   ``The possibility of success for business is far greater than
the risks,'' Wada said in explaining why he moved to Hong Kong
during the jittery runup to 1997, when the colony reverts to
Chinese rule.
   Despite the anxiety of residents about the future, Wada and many
other foreigners are betting Hong Kong will continue to be a good
place to do business.
   ``I think people generally feel Hong Kong will remain a going
concern,'' said John T. Kamm, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce. ``For businessmen, it's paradise.''
   Some aspects of paradise are a corporate tax rate of only 16.5
percent, one of the world's most advanced infrastructures, a
central location in Asia and a laissez-faire government attitude.
   Businessmen believe Hong Kong is the prime base for business
with China, which has promised the territory can keep its
capitalist system for at least 50 years.
   They point to China's decision to let dissident astrophysicist
Fang Lizhi leave the country after a year in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, and to the soaring Hong Kong stock market.
   Overseas investors acknowledge that, because they are
foreigners, they can bail out if the business climate deteriorates.
Hong Kong residents who lack the escape route a foreign passport
provides are much less sanguine.
   Yaohan's splashy arrival underlined the continued strong
presence of Japanese companies in Hong Kong retailing.
   An estimated 40 percent of the colony's department store
business is controlled by Japanese companies, which entered the
market as early as 30 years ago. Yaohan alone plans to increase its
number of Hong Kong stores from three to five by 1991.
   Japanese banks and financial institutions are establishing local
branches and individual investors have been buying real estate,
said Shigetu Suda, senior manager at Nomura Research Institute Hong
Kong Ltd.
   For the fiscal year ending in March, Japanese investment was
about $1.9 billion, up 14.2 percent from the previous year despite
China's brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in 1989,
according to Japanese government figures. Six years ago, annual
investment was about $400 million.
   The other major foreign investor, besides China, is the United
States, with an estimated total of $6 billion to $7 billion in the
colony.
   Citibank is investing at least $150 million in a building that
will house much of its local operation. Americans with less capital
are opening restaurants and other businesses.
   Although Kamm believes the crackdown in China has had little
effect on foreign investors in Hong Kong, there are indications of
caution. The number of U.S.-owned factories has increased only
slightly and membership in the American Chamber of Commerce has
fallen slightly.
   More than half the 49 multinational companies responding to a
survey this year by the consulting firm Business International said
moving their offices out of the colony was a possibility.
   Rising costs and staff availability were primary concerns, but
uncertainty about 1997 ``obviously was a consideration,'' Business
International said.
   Observers say much foreign investment could be withdrawn quickly
in a crisis, and risk analyst Robert Broadfoot noted that Japanese
investment throughout Asia grew much faster last year than it did
in Hong Kong.
   He dismisses claims that the importance China attaches to the
huge foreign economic presence is the best guarantee for Hong
Kong's 5.7 million people of a stable and prosperous future.
   ``You cannot have an economic guarantee,'' he said. ``One does
not exist. China is motivated first, second and third by political
considerations.''
   Wada, the Yaohan chairman, remains confident. When asked where
he expected to be in 10 years, he flashed a broad, infectious smile
and said: ``Because Hong Kong will belong to China, I should say
Hong Kong AND China.''

<HEAD>Religious Helpfulness Found To Serve Self Or Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Beggars in Spain sometimes plead, ``A penny for your soul.''
This implies that the giving is for the giver's sake. It sometimes
may work that way, but it also can be genuine concern for another.
   Studies have found that kind, helpful deeds may be strictly
self-serving to gain status, reassurance or influence, but also can
be utterly altruistic.
   These variations also show up among religious believers, whose
faith teaches compassion and helpfulness, new behavioral
experiments find.
   The studies are ``the first using empirical methods to measure
whether real altruism is specifically there,'' says psychologist C.
Daniel Batson of the University of Kansas, one of the researchers.
   Results from reactions to varied situations found that a certain
``quest orientation'' in faith _ a searching kind of faith that
surmounts doubts _ seemed genuinely altruistic, impelled to serve
others.
   But that selfless motivation didn't show up in two other faith
orientations.
   They are ``extrinsic'' religion that is strictly utilitarian to
improve standing or reinforce one's chosen way, and ``intrinsic''
religion that seeks unity of being and strives to transcend
self-centeredness.
   From those perspectives, it was found that in offering help
``the motivation was not directed to increasing the welfare of the
person in need, but was directed to getting a reward,'' Batson said.
   That is, the help offered had ``egoistic'' motives, the studies
conclude, while the ``quest orientation'' seemed moved by real
altruism.
   Batson compared the three ways of being religious with the
width, height and depth dimensions of an object, and added in a
telephone interview, ``Some of all three are in everybody.''
   While previous studies have found that religious believers
report more charitable actions than others, the new study focused
on individual motivations in simulated life situations.
   ``It was outside the religious context institutionally or the
helping program of the church,'' Batson said, adding in reference
to churches, ``One should not ignore the important
institutionalizing of help.''
   A report on the studies appeared in the American Psychological
Association's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
   Involved in the two experimental studies were 46 psychology
students at the University of Texas in Austin, and 60 students at
the University of Kansas at Lawrence, all of Christian backgrounds.
   They were presented in two different studies with opportunities,
termed real but actually not, to take part in a ``walkathon'' to
help a disabled boy get needed treatment, or to help a girl whose
parents had been killed to care for siblings and finish college.
   In both situations, the types of help and described difficulties
or capabilities necessary for helping were varied, which allowed
testing degrees of concern. Varied conditions of peer pressure also
allowed measuring against that factor.
   Besides work of Batson and associates at at the University of
Kansas, two psychologists at the University of Texas, Patrick
Jennings and Thomas Brown, supervised the studies there.
   Summing up the results, the report says that an ``extrinsic,
means orientation to religion does not increase concern for the
welfare of others'' but ``appeared to be associated with decreased
pro-social motivation.''
   Indications were that the extrinsic orientation was ``directed
toward the egoistic goal of avoiding social or self-punishment for
failure to do the right thing.''
   On the other hand, while ``an intrinsic, end orientation to
religion can at times be associated with increased helping, the
underlying motivation is egoistic,'' the report says.
   Noting that scores on this orientation were positively related
to volunteering to help only when likelihood of qualifying was low,
the report adds:
   ``The pattern of results suggested that the pro-social
motivation associated with an intrinsic, end orientation to
religion was directed toward an egoistic goal _ either gaining
social and self-rewards or avoiding social and self-punishment... .
   ``Appparently for those scoring high on intrinsic religion, the
thought of helping counted more than the deed. ... It appears the
highly moral self-image associated with this way of being religious
does not reflect selfless concern for the welfare of others.
   ``Instead, it reflects a more self-centered desire to obtain
social or self-rewards for being a good person. This desire is a
different egoistic goal than the punishment avoidance associated
with extrinsic religion, but it is still egoistic.''
   In contrast, the report cites ``strong and consistent support''
for associating the ``quest orientation'' in religion with
altruistic motivation.
   ``Among subjects who volunteered to help, this orientation
correlated positively with performance on the difficult qualifying
task,'' the report says.
   ``These results suggested that although quest religion was not
associated with a change in the quantity of pro-social motivation,
it was associated with a change in the quality.''

<HEAD>The Real New York: Surprises, Jokes and Treasures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this summer of the Dartman and the Zodiac
Killer, of Donald and Ivana Trump, remember that there is a New
York City the headlines never proclaim, the tourists never see, the
movies never mythologize.
   The real New York is a home to 7.5 million, not a cartoon
designed to amuse, titillate or horrify. It is not the Statue of
Liberty, the World Trade Center or Times Square. It is not found on
Broadway or Wall Street.
   The real New York is neither famous nor infamous, but a third
place where life goes on, and where the extremes that flash across
the evening news seem almost as absurd and remote as they do in
Peoria.
   Most New Yorkers are lured or kept here by work, which explains
why they endure its hardships. Their consolation, their New York,
is the city's endless store of hidden surprises, jokes and
treasures.
   You see the real New York at dawn on the streets of Hell's
Kitchen, where Croatian women returning home after a night of
cleaning offices in the towers to the east bump into their husbands
heading off to the day shift.
   You see it up in Central Park, where the mist stages impossibly
romantic vistas for the day's first tennis players, runners and dog
walkers.
   There are oases like Pomander Walk, a mews of Tudor rowhouses
between West 95th and 96th streets, and Sniffen Court, an alley of
converted coach houses and stables off East 36th that looks like it
did 70 years ago.
   The Hispanic Society, an almost forgotten museum on the
outskirts of Harlem, has six El Grecos. A Buddhist temple on Staten
Island has the hemisphere's largest privately owned collection of
Tibetan art.
   In the real New York, the Catholic Workers still feed the poor
and demented at the settlement houses founded by Dorothy Day. A
Vietnamese immigrant who once huddled at the bottom of a boat in
the South China Sea rises to the head of his class at City College.
   The real New York is a little wild. White-tailed deer have been
spotted in the forests of the northern Bronx, and earlier this year
a red fox stepped over the line from Nassau County into Alley Pond
Park in Queens. Some people on the southern end of Staten Island
still keep horses in their yards. There's even a farm, the Klein
family spread in eastern Queens.
   The spindly trees of midtown Manhattan have an average life span
of only seven years, but Isham Park in upper Manhattan boasts a
200-year-old gingko tree that stands 90 feet high.
   Tourists equate the Bronx with the Yankees and the zoo. But at
one end of the borough is Wave Hill, a Hudson River estate that was
home to Mark Twain, Theodore Roosevelt and Arturo Toscanini. At the
other is City Island, a seaport village where mansard roofs and
church spires peek over the treetops.
   Real New Yorkers drink the water, judged by Consumer Reports to
be superior to many bottled brands, and slurp coffee from an
infinite number of blue-and-white cardboard ``Greek Design'' coffee
cups made in suburban Westchester County.
   They eat Chinese at thousands of Szechuan or Hunan restaurants,
all with virtually identical menus, all with a chicken dish named
after a mysterious Gen. Tso.
   The world knows New York's infrastructure is crumbling, but real
New Yorkers know that the Third Water Tunnel _ the nation's largest
local public works project _ is slowly being dug 75 stories beneath
their feet, through rock 2 billion years old.
   An equally unsung engineering feat is the 400-ton block of
concrete that slides back and forth on an oily film in the slanted
attic of the Citicorp Tower, counteracting the winds that try to
push the building over.
   The real New York is full of real characters, like the ones who
gathered outside Irving Berlin's window every year to serenade the
songwriter on his birthday, and the three kids who rode into the
record book last year by completing a tour of the entire subway
system in 29 hours, 47 minutes and 12 seconds.
   Eric Staller, an artist, drives a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle with
1,659 small lights that flash on and off in 25 different patterns.
Michael Feinstein, president of the Hatters union, drives a cab in
his off hours to supplement his income.
   Harry Nugent, the mellifluous subway conductor on the No. 1
Broadway Local, weaves his station stop announcements into a
travelogue that entertains the most hardened straphangers. ``Going
our way?'' he asks riders. ``We're the one to Van Cortlandt Park.''
   Nugent likes to entertain, but even he thinks that a certain
conductor on the No. 6 line _ an Elvis impersonator _ goes too far.
   Real New Yorkers walk, sometimes into the unexpected: an old
friend, roommate or lover, or the statue of a panther lurking on a
rock above East Drive in Central Park. If they spot a star athlete,
they might wave; if it's an author or movie star, a small, knowing
smile suffices.
   They walk through Woodlawn Cemetery to visit Fiorello LaGuardia,
Duke Ellington and F. W. Woolworth. A free map can be had at the
stone gatehouse.
   Anyone who tires of the real New York can always go to the
Queens Museum and visit a miniature one _ the 9,335-square-foot
model of the city with its 865,000 tiny buildings.
   You might leave one day for a better job or a bigger home, but
you always keep a personal set of landmarks and memories. The
shabby old building where you rented your first apartment; the
corner where you kissed the one who became your spouse; dawn's
light on the Hudson the morning your son was born.
   This is your New York, the real one, and neither the murderers
nor the billionaires nor the evening news can take it away.

<HEAD>California Bar Brings Lawyers' Drug and Alcohol Problems Out of

<TEXT>
   Marshall Bitkower, a former prosecutor, had
built a lucrative private law practice. He had a nice home in the
San Fernando Valley. He drove a Rolls-Royce.
   And then something happened.
   Bitkower started ``borrowing'' money from client trust funds. He
was arrested and served time for drunken driving. In 1982, to avoid
disbarment, he voluntarily resigned from the practice of law.
   What happened to Bitkower was cocaine. His story, it appears, is
headed for a happy ending; he has been straight for eight years now.
   But the State Bar of California says there are thousands of
other lawyers who come to court each day drunk or high. And the bar
_ which normally keeps its members' personal problems private _ is
going public with a high-profile campaign to battle substance abuse
among attorneys.
   ``If you're in a high-stress occupation, substance abuse is
greater,'' said state bar President Alan Rothenberg.
   ``The legal profession is certainly a high-stress profession. If
you're doing trial work, that's high stress. If you're in a
criminal trial, your client's life or death is at stake. That's
about as stressful as anything.''
   Surveys conducted by the state bars in Washington and Oregon
indicate 15 percent to 18 percent of lawyers are alcoholics. The
State Bar of Texas estimates the incidence of substance abuse among
lawyers may be 20 percent _ twice as high as that of the general
population.
   The American Bar Association says 86 percent of state bar
associations have some sort of program for impaired attorneys;
there are about 100 active programs across the United States.
   The ABA launched a Commission on Impaired Attorneys in 1988 to
serve as a clearinghouse and network for programs like Texas'
Lawyers Assistance Program, which has offered confidential
counseling since 1982.
   The California bar is the nation's largest.
   ``If you figure that one out of 10 Americans has a substance
abuse problem and there are 122,000 lawyers in the California bar,
then as many as 12,000 may have a problem,'' said Rothenberg.
``Even if it's only 5 percent, that's 6,100 lawyers and that's too
many.''
   But California, with more attorneys than any state and a fair
share of celebrity, multimillionaire lawyers, has been slow to
voluntarily tarnish its public image. Rothenberg acknowledges that
going public was a tough decision.
   ``We finally decided we had no choice,'' he said. ``The bigger
risk was not to do something.''
   The new program involves referral to treatment programs, and
offers insurance coverage to lawyers for such treatment.
   Law schools will be urged to include a substance abuse course in
their curriculums. The bar's mandatory Continuing Legal Education
also will require attorneys to take a course on the subject in
order to keep their licenses to practice. Law firms will be
encouraged to address the problem with programs in their own
offices. The bar also has a 24-hour hotline for attorneys needing
referrals to drug and alcohol programs.
   Meanwhile, a task force is gathering statistics on how many
lawyers actually have drug and alcohol problems.
   Lawyers who turn to drugs and alcohol usually get into trouble
with their clients and often face arrest and disciplinary
proceedings.
   ``We find that in a lot of cases, the person suffering from
substance abuse is not handling business as they should,'' said
Bill Davis, the bar's assistant chief trial counsel who handles
complaints about attorneys lodged by the public. ``If the substance
abuse gets worse, ultimately they're stealing clients' funds to
support their habit.''
   That scenario, in fact, is what happened to Bitkower.
   ``I was under a lot of stress,'' he recalls of the early 1980s
when his practice was thriving. ``Somebody recommended cocaine to
calm me down and help me deal with the stress and aggravation.''
   The result was disastrous.
   ``It ruined my life,'' he said. ``It almost killed me. I lost
everything. I ended up sleeping on a mattress in Hermosa Beach and
hitchhiking. From a nice family man in the Valley who had it all, I
went to having nothing.''
   About that time, he said, ``I woke up one day and decided I
either was going to die or get help.'' He checked into a six-week
drug treatment program at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica,
where he kicked his cocaine habit.
   ``You can come back after sliding so far down,'' he said.
   Bitkower, 47, has put his marriage and family back together,
works as an administrator at a Beverly Hills law firm and recently
was recommended by the California bar for reinstatement as a lawyer.
   Bitkower joined Alcoholics Anonymous, but he also credited Ted
Cohen, a family friend who had begun helping lawyers with alcohol
problems.
   Cohen, himself an attorney and recovering alcoholic, introduced
Bitkower to a group called The Other Bar. An offshoot of Alcoholics
Anonymous, The Other Bar offers lawyers and judges the help of
their peers in a ``safe haven'' where their problems need not be
publicized and where others understand. It has helped some 4,000
lawyers deal with alcohol and drug addiction, Cohen said.
   Most lawyers now seeking help from The Other Bar are young, and
their addiction is to cocaine, Cohen said.
   ``With anybody under 40, it's drugs,'' he said. ``The young kids
are not alcoholics.''
   Cohen started the group in 1972, when his own drinking caught up
with him. He was convicted of stealing a small amount of money in
an insurance scam and ultimately served six months in a prison work
furlough program. Fellow AA members visited him, and the idea of
The Other Bar was born.
   Cohen, who resumed practicing law in 1974, now splits his time
between legal cases and The Other Bar. He also is a member of the
ABA commission.
   ``You try to give back what was given to you,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dubious history was made after midnight last
Monday _ four national late-night, talk-variety shows on the air.
On the bright side, this may mean such talk shows finally face a
shortage of Famous Dull Guests.
   Two of the shows, on ABC and CBS, are new. It would be unkind to
say they're awful. But they are competing in the Whose Bright Idea
Was This? contest that network executives in Hollywood hold each
week.
   The leading contender, CBS' ``The Midnight Hour,'' made its
debut a week after the premiere of ABC's ``Into The Night Starring
Rick Dees,'' which mainly features an audience that shrieks and
shrieks and shrieks.
   Fellow late-nighters Arsenio Hall and David Letterman can rest
easy. But they should keep an eye on Dees, just in case.
   His Los Angeles-based show, offering a rock band, sofa chairs,
fake palm trees on one side and a New York-like theater front on
the other, already has interrupted the usual run of Famous Dull
Guests for two genuinely funny bits.
   One on opening night last week put the home audience in a guest
seat _ literally. The TV camera was put in one of those sofa
chairs, and Dees posed it questions and the usual dull responses
were printed on the TV screen.
   The TV camera-audience wound up mooning the host.
   Two nights later, there was an inspired takeoff of those
late-night commercials for the memorable music of Zamfir and his
magic pan flute. Actor Leland Davis used a balloon in lieu of pan
flute to play the hit song, ``I'm a Little Teacup.''
   Well, you had to see it.
   But no such inspiration has yet attacked CBS' summer series, its
first late-night talk venture since Pat Sajak's show went to
Nielsen's Boot Hill in March. However, a bad new talk show needs
time to settle down and get worse.
   Despite its ``Midnight'' title, the CBS newcomer is supposed to
commence at 12:45 p.m. EDT on weeknights.
   But it made its debut _ live only in Eastern and Central time
zones _ at 1:07 a.m. A CBS News special on the Supreme Court
nominee, David Souter, caused the delay. Darn those pesky news
people.
   When it finally began, the show was introduced by its executive
producer, Michael Weisman, who was the second executive producer of
Sajak's show. As a TV personality, Weisman is no Don Kirschner.
   ``We're like a warmup for the `CBS Morning News','' chattered
comic Joy Behar, the first host-of-the-week that ``Midnight'' will
have during its eight-week summer run as showcase for new talent
and unusual things.
   The series has an unusual set for a Los Angeles-based show _ a
band, fake palm trees, a fake fireplace, a real sofa, a real table
and a real ashtray. It even has a failure-shaped swimming pool.
   Behar, a Brooklyn native who sounds like a kinder, gentler Joan
Rivers, did jokes about New York vs. laid-back L.A. and the
incredibly trim, fit L.A. women. This is unusual for a New York
comic in Los Angeles.
   Dees' debut show had Charlie Sheen, plugging his new Navy SEAL
flick.
   But CBS' ``Midnight,'' daring to be different, had no real star
as its first guest.
   Instead, it brought in a comic, Jenny Jones, who Behar
identified as a former Wayne Newton backup singer who mainly works
for women-only audiences. Jones said she recently played a gig in
El Toro, Calif.
   A regular feature on the show is an 800 number for call-in
queries from Eastern and Central time zones. Unfortunately, one
caller, Don from Tennessee, apparently got cut off before he could
ask anything.
   ``This segment is not working,'' Behar said as more phone woe
occurred.
   But she tried again the next night when, after her unusual new
monologue about differences between New York and laid-back L.A.,
there came a true megastar guest.
   He was identified as writer-producer-comic Tom Arnold, who has
been married for six months to surly sitcom star Roseanne Barr.
Barr was offstage. She refused to come on, but was televised hiding
behind a fern.
   Behar grilled Arnold about tabloid reports on his married life
with Barr. She cited one story about a fertility test of his sperm
with a hamster.
   After they joshed about that, the 800 line was opened to
inquiring minds. One citizen from New York raised the hamster
matter anew.
   The hamster ``looked like your Mom,'' Arnold shot back. He
grinned. ``Just kidding, just kidding.''
   CBS eventually hopes to compete in late-night television,
according to Western diplomats.

   African places and people are involved
throughout the Bible, a United Church of Christ minister told a
conference of black Christians, saying they should take pride in
that heritage.
   ``Christianity is not just something we learned in slavery in
America,'' said the Rev. G. Wesley Raney of Daytona, Beach, Fla.
``We were present from the very start, in biblical times.''
   He said African references occur from start to finish _ from the
Garden of Eden linked to a river around the land of Cush, which
means ``black'' and represents Ethiopia, to African church leaders
who ordained the apostle Paul.
   ``The Bible is an African book, containing stories by and about
the people of the land of Canaan, who were blood brothers of the
people of Egypt and Ethiopia,'' Raney said.
   He said other biblical terms denoting people with dark skin
include Ham, Hamite, Hittite, Put, Libya, Nimrod, Jebusite, Amorite
and Sheba.

   Willie Flynn was a captive audience
for his General Development Corp. salesman.
   While the salesman trumpeted the glories of owning a home in a
GDC development, Flynn sat in his wheelchair _ the legacy of a Viet
Cong land mine that cost him the use of his legs in 1965 and killed
two friends.
   ``They told me in the hospital that I was the lucky one,'' he
recalls. But Flynn, 46, was not so lucky when it came to making
Florida investments.
   He's among some 11,000 people who bought General Development
properties between 1983 and 1989, when the Miami-based developer _
now in bankruptcy court and fighting for its survival while fending
off criminal and civil prosecutions _ was operating what a federal
indictment describes as a carefully staged fraud.
   Authorities call it one of the largest frauds in the history of
Florida, quite a distinction in a state known for its land scams.
   But this was much more sophisticated than the swampland sales of
the 1950s and '60s, they say. According to the indictment and
interviews with federal authorities, GDC relied on high-pressure
sales, bogus appraisals, and control of all aspects of a
transaction.
   Prospects were kept from learning the true value of properties,
the indictment says. Hotel clerks were even paid to screen
customers' calls to prevent them from hearing from GDC competitors.
Lot buyers were urged to move up to developed homes, and there was
constant pressure to ``buy now before the price goes up even more.''
   After the sale was made, authorities say, the owners were sent
glowing statements telling them it was increasing in value.
   The company pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy in a March plea
bargain soon after the indictments were released, and it has closed
many of its sales offices and laid off more than 5,500 employees.
But the plea bargain was rejected this month by U.S. District Judge
Lenore Nesbitt, who thought the plea to one count of fraud
conspiracy was insufficient. A new agreement now must be negotiated.
   Flynn, who was living in Hillside, Ill., had used disability
benefits and Veterans Administration help to build up his savings.
About seven years ago, he decided to invest in Florida home sites,
with a plan to eventually live there.
   He bought GDC lots in Port Labelle, in southwest Florida, and
Port St. Lucie on the Atlantic Coast.
   About a year later, his GDC salesman called and told him he
needed to develop one of his lots. He couldn't just leave them idle
while the communities were growing, the salesman said.
   He was urged to take what the company called a ``Southward Ho!''
trip. Customers were flown to their planned communities and
escorted by a GDC salesman there for three days. They were wined,
dined, and told to buy.
   Flynn said his salesman was with him ``night and day. He would
take me out for food late at night and meet me for coffee in the
morning.''
   Flynn was persuaded to buy a large home with a swimming pool for
$216,000. His Illinois attorney told him the price was too high,
and GDC came down to $119,000. Like most GDC buyers, Flynn got his
mortgage from a GDC finance company. And he accepted GDC's own
appraisal of the property's value.
   Flynn moved here in 1988; soon afterward, he wanted to
refinance. He went to SunBank and was told his property was worth
$92,000.
   ``I felt cheated and hurt,'' Flynn said.
   The General Development sales pitches worked, Flynn said,
because the prices, by Northern standards, seemed reasonable for
Florida homes. And, he said, General Development was a big,
well-known company.
   ``Most people felt the government wouldn't let nothing like this
happen _ it couldn't happen here,'' Flynn said. ``They're sorry
people if this is the way they've got to make their money. If they
did me this way, I wonder what they did to other people?''
   Attorneys, investigators and homeowner leaders can cite litanies
of examples of buyers hit worse than Flynn _ people who are trapped
in homes that have wiped out their savings.
   Mark Binstein, a veteran New Jersey-based land-fraud
investigator who is banding GDC owners together, calls the
operation ``a classic Ponzi scheme that was unconscionable and
cruel.'' GDC habitually foreclosed on people after they had learned
their property was worth far less than they thought, he said.
   GDC once had a good reputation, and had been in business three
decades. Harold Reecer, a Cincinnati-based GDC salesman, recalls
the days when the company promoted honesty and letting the property
sell itself.
   But Reecer said he was fired for insubordination in the
mid-1970s when he protested departures from that policy. New
managers at General Development stepped up the pressure on salesmen
and told them their first priority was getting buyers signed to
contracts, he said. Let company lawyers worry about any problems,
he said the managers told him.
   GDC salesmen learned to tell ``outrageous lies,'' Reecer said.
One salesman told buyers interested in Port Labelle that a monorail
would be built to connect the southwest Florida town with Orlando,
Reecer said.
   Some people, though, think buyers should have been more wary.
   ``I have to ask these people, where were their damn brains?''
said Bill Duigan of Port Labelle, who worked briefly for GDC in the
1970s. ``It's pretty silly to buy property sight unseen. You
wouldn't buy a car like this.''
   Martin Veiner, a former college professor who lives in Port St.
Lucie, is trying to organize the 220,000 residents of GDC's nine
Florida communities, but has found that many people act as if they
deserve their fate: ``They say nobody put a gun to their heads.
Then they say, `I'm dumb.' ''

   Veiner was not caught in any fraud; he bought his spacious home
from a bank after GDC foreclosed on its buyer.
   Still, he and all his neighbors are victims of the GDC mess, of
overbuilding and severe infrastructure problems. ``It's been said
Port St. Lucie was platted as if they didn't expect anyone to live
there,'' Veiner said.
   The 77-square-mile city's population skyrocketed from 15,000 in
1980 to nearly 60,000 now. The city has only two major roads
crossing the city and both have only two lanes. Traffic gridlock is
a way of life.
   Port St. Lucie is a family-oriented community, and there isn't
enough room for necessary schools, ballfields and parks.
   And the roads GDC promised to develop? Much remains to be done.
Some 230 miles of roads will cost at least $20 million to complete
in Port St. Lucie.
   Veiner and other homeowner advocates suspect the bill for road
improvements will be much higher. To the north, in Palm Bay, it
will cost an estimated $73 million to complete roads in GDC's Port
Malabar community.
   Money for much of the work will come out of the homeowners'
pockets. Port St. Lucie property taxes will jump from $3.15 per
$1,000 to $4.05 per thousand; utilities for homeowners such as
Flynn have jumped from a little over $20 a month three years ago to
about $200 a month.
   General Development has begun negotiations with the cities and
counties involved, offering undeveloped lots in most cases in
return for settlement of its development obligations. GDC also is
turning over the utilities it operated to the cities and counties.
   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization in April after the fraud indictments, is struggling
for survival.
   It's faced with myriad lawsuits, must come up with a
court-approved restitution plan, and is trying to bring in money to
keep operating while the delinquency percentage of the more than
77,000 people still owing payments on GDC properties has jumped to
51 percent.
   Company spokeswoman Nelly Medel said General Development remains
confident it can emerge from Chapter 11.
   ``We still have our assets. We have new management,'' she said.
``We're trying to put all of this behind us.''
   Veiner and other homeowner advocates doubt General Development
can survive. It has more than 100,000 creditors; the bankruptcy
hearings feature packed houses of lawyers, each vying for a share
of a shrinking pie.
   The company also faces class-action suits on behalf of the home
and lot buyers. Their lawyers are going after not only GDC, but
also after banks they say knowingly over-inflated mortgage values.
And they'll seek out more targets, including possibly GDC's lawyers
and its directors.
   In the short term, GDC must satisfy the judge. The amount of
fines and sentence faced by the company, former president Robert
Ehrling, and former chairman David Brown _ who also pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to defraud _ will depend on efforts to renegotiate a
plea agreement.
   In addition, court-appointed special master Thomas Wood said
he's still having trouble getting GDC to agree to a restitution
plan.
   GDC originally offered to pay $100 million over 25 years to the
homeowners covered in the fraud count, but Wood has said he wants
more money, sooner.
   ``It's just a mess,'' said Veiner. ``I don't think we're going
to get full value for what we deserve _ that's unrealistic. I don't
know how it's going to come out, I really don't.''

<HEAD>Farm Bill Not Expected To Settle Old Subsidy Argument</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever Congress decides on the 1990 farm
bill can't begin to settle the basic question of whether
agricultural subsidies should exist at all. Are they justified or
simply an expensive ripoff?
   Farm bills for decades have been complicated vehicles for
agricultural special interests. They are increasingly expensive,
costing $50 billion or more just for commodity supports over a
five-year span.
   Defenders say such expense is necessary to preserve the heart
and soul of U.S. agriculture, the family farmer, and to guarantee
consumers a fair shake at the supermarket.
   Some critics say federal farm subsidies are really welfare and
that the larger producers should be excluded. But lawyers Michael
R. McLeod and John Harris defend the system.
   McLeod is a former general counsel for the Senate Agriculture
Committee, and Harris was associate general counsel for the
Agriculture Department.
   ``To say farmers who participate in farm programs are on welfare
has as much validity as saying newspapers receiving a subsidy
through the postal service are on welfare, or that homeowners who
use the mortgage interest deduction are on welfare,'' McLeod and
Harris say in their Agricultural Law Letter.
   The two analysts commented on proposals to restrict federal farm
subsidies to smaller producers and eliminating the payments to big
farmers.
   ``Any farm program that confers benefits on producers of a
particular commodity is fair game in an urban Congress,'' they
said. ``However, it is not fair to try to bring down the entire
federal farm structure by making it unworkable.''
   Moreover, said McLeod and Harris, legislation to impose
eligibility tests for farmers comparable to the means tests for
welfare recipients ``fails to recognize the broader implications of
agricultural programs.''
   Consumers, they said, have had access to an abundant supply of
reasonably priced food year after year because of ``a sound and
stable agricultural economy that at least partially depends on
these very farm programs.''
   James Bovard of the Cato Institute, an independent public policy
research organization, thinks that argument is a worn piece of
barnyard debris that should have been tossed aside years ago.
   One of the features of farm programs since the early 1930s has
been the limitation of production through acreage controls, soil
banks, quotas, price support incentives or other devices.
   Even so, farm production has generally out-paced demands, except
during years when exports have drawn off surpluses and production
suffered from bad weather.
   Direct subsidies are paid to farmers who cooperate in the
various commodity programs. Other benefits are in the form of
credit guarantees and technical assistance.
   Whether direct or indirect, Bovard says there is no difference _
a subsidy is a subsidy.
   ``The only way to successfully reform farm programs is to
abolish them,'' Bovard said in a recent policy paper. ``We cannot
compete with either foreign farmers or foreign farm subsidies by
shutting down American farms.''
   In Bovard's view, farm productivity ``has always advanced faster
than politicians' understanding'' of the problem.
   Bovard said that in the 1980s taxpayers and consumers ``shelled
out $260 billion to support Americas farmers.'' Farm programs, he
said, currently cost around $20 billion a year plus $10 billion in
higher food prices.
   Almost all of that cost is ``a dead loss to the American
economy,'' he said. Yet, the Agriculture Department is rewarding
farmers for idling almost 60 million acres this year _ the
equivalent of shutting down all the cropland in California,
Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana and Wisconsin.
   ``There is nothing to show for the outlays except idled acres,
polluted groundwater and richer farmers,'' Bovard said.
   When USDA and farm-state members of Congress talk about costs of
farm programs, they usually refer only to the direct cost of price
support operations. Bovard said that is often less than half of the
total government spending on farmers.
   For example, he said, in 1990 the USDA expects to spend less
than $8.1 billion on price support and ``deficiency'' payments to
farmers.
   Bovard said the estimate overlooks defaults in export credit
guarantees, bonuses to exporters to subsidize commodity sales
overseas, Food for Peace, Farmers Home Administration operations,
assistance by the Soil Conservation Service, crop insurance
subsidies, free advice from the Extension Service and agricultural
research.
   ``Thus, while congressmen talk of farm subsidies amounting to $8
billion, taxpayers are actually liable for over $25 billion in
spending and loan guarantees,'' he said.
   Bovard added, ``It is difficult to know exactly how many USDA
loans and loan guarantees will be defaulted on, but if the nation
has learned anything from the savings-and-loan crisis, it should
recognize that federal guarantees are often the most expensive
government programs of all.''
   A mainstay of Bovard's argument is that the average full-time
farmer is a wealthy individual and doesn't need government help.
   Bovard said many economists agree a farm should have gross sales
of more than $100,000 a year to be viable. Those, he said, are
full-time farmers who account for 80 percent to 90 percent of total
farm income. In 1980, there were 271,000 farms in the $100,000-plus
category. By 1988, there were 323,000.
   Some farm-aid advocates also count farms in the
$40,000-to-$99,000 category as full-time. Others, however, say many
of those are underemployed in much of the year or are inefficient.
   The average net worth of U.S. families in 1986 was $78,734 per
household. In contrast, he said, the average full-time farmer as of
Dec. 31, 1988, had a net worth of more than $1 million.
   ``Some liberals advocate continuing government aid to small
farmers only, but even part-time farmers are far wealthier than the
average American family,'' Bovard said. ``Farmers in the $40,000 to
$99,999 sales class have a net worth of $426,487 _ more than five
times that of the average American family.''

   Don't liken him to Donald Trump.
   Bernard Tapie is indeed wealthy, publicity-hungry and
unashamedly ambitious. Yes, he is eying a run for the presidency
and has just engineered the biggest deal of an extraordinary career
by acquiring an 80 percent stake in Adidas AG, the giant sporting
goods company.
   But Trump, said Tapie in a magazine interview earlier this
month, ``is everything I loathed most ... the embodiment of
cynicism and bad taste. The things he puts foremost are those that
make me the most uneasy.''
   Trump-like or not, Tapie has developed the highest public
profile of any businessman in France.
   He owns the country's best soccer team, serves in Parliament,
has hosted a television show, and wrote a book about himself
titled, ``Gagner'' (``To Win''). Four years ago, women surveyed in
a national poll picked Tapie over movie stars and singers as the
man they would most like to accompany on a vacation.
   But Tapie, 47, says he's not content to make money and live the
good life. He wants Adidas to expand non-profit sports development
programs in Africa. He wants the French public to be more
hospitable to immigrants. He wants to command a crusade against
Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's far-right Nationa Front.
   It's a desire to be different from Trump, the ego-driven New
York developer who made headlines with personal and financial
excesses, that compelled Tapie to take on the mission of stopping
Le Pen, Tapie told Paris Match magazine.
   Might he carry this fight all the way to the presidency, the
interviewer asked.
   ``If necessary, yes,'' Tapie replied. ``If you have a chance to
take a position of power, to affect the course of events, why not
do it?''
   Polls show Tapie to be broadly popular across France, and he
fine-tunes his image by depicting himself as a populist scorned by
the political and business elite.
   He grew up in a blue-collar Paris suburb and tried an assortment
of jobs _ including pop singer _ before establishing himself in the
1970s as one of France's first world-class takeover specialists.
   He refined a technique of buying up bankrupt or failing
companies at nominal prices, improving their efficiency, then
selling them for a quick and often substantial gain.
   He has promised he won't repeat this pattern with Adidas, locked
in a battle with Nike Inc. of the United States for the title of
world's No. 1 sporting goods maker.
   The $290 million acquisition followed nine months of secret
negotiations, but Tapie made sure the news was spread when the
secrecy ended. He announced the purchase in Rome, on the eve of the
World Cup soccer championship, to scores of reporters gathered from
around the world.
   It was one of the biggest purchases ever of a West German firm
by a Frenchman, and earned nationalistic praise for Tapie even from
commentators skeptical about his financial base. Tapie silenced
some doubters by listing eight major banks as his backers _ four
from France, two from West Germany, two from Japan.
   An Adidas subsidiary, the Swiss-based firm ISL, serves as
marketing consultant for international soccer's governing body, and
Tapie has stated openly that he hopes his acquisition will help
ensure France's selection as host of the 1998 World Cup.
   Although it lost money last year, Adidas remains one of the
best-known brand names in the world, with products sold in 160
countries. It has 10,000 employees, and its sales and licensing
revenues last year totaled about $2.8 billion.
   It dwarfs the total size of Tapie's industrial empire in France
_ a constantly changing assortment of companies involved in such
products ranging from weighing machines to health foods.
   One of his most prized possessions is Olympic Marseille, a
soccer team that was foundering before Tapie began spending
millions on world-class players. This year, the team reached the
semifinals of the European Cup, which determines the continent's
best pro team.
   He previously sponsored teams in the Tour de France, and was the
executive force behind Greg LeMond in 1986 when he became the first
American to win the world's premier bicycle race.
   A yachtsman and pilot, Tapie describes sports as one of his
three passions, along with business and politics.
   In December, he took on Le Pen in a nationally televised debate,
and was a consensus winner. A subsequent poll indicated 46 percent
of French voters would support him for president.
   He serves in Parliament as an independent, but votes with the
governing Socialist Party and is believed to be well-liked by
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Despite his connections, he describes himself as an outsider.
   ``The class war still exists,'' he told Paris Match, ``I have
the whole establishment against me.''
   He said Le Pen, who favors the deportation of immigrants,
``capitalizes on the negligence of others.''
   ``Me, I've shown I know how to beat him,'' Tapie said. ``The
political establishment either doesn't know or doesn't want to.''
   Last month, Tapie went on television to announce his latest
anti-Le Pen strategy _ a ``Citizens Forum'' which will stage
rallies in 400 communities considered strongholds for the far
right. He vowed to reduce the National Front's support in the polls
from 15 percent to 10 percent.
   Four years ago, an interviewer asked Tapie what his weak point
was.
   ``I'm always in a state of insecurity,'' he replied. ``When
everything is going well, I'm afraid it won't last.''

maintenance violations at airports in early 1989, the company said.
   Martin R. Shugrue, the bankruptcy-court appointed trustee
running Eastern, said Tuesday the airline was prepared to admit
fraudulent maintenance and record-keeping but not conspiracy. The
refusal led to the collapse of plea bargain talks with the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Brooklyn.

   Americans' wages, salaries and other benefits
shot up 5.2 percent over the past year, the government said in a
report analysts saw as another sign that inflation is failing to
retreat.
   Much of the increase in employment costs was due to higher
benefit expenses, such as rising health-care costs, the Labor
Department said Tuesday. Benefit costs alone jumped a sharp 6.9
percent for the 12-month period ending in June, well above the 5.6
percent increase of a year ago.

   Congress voted to preserve U.S. sugar policy
despite criticism that it is bad for agriculture, consumers,
foreign relations and the war on drugs.
   Both the House and Senate on Tuesday defeated amendments to the
1990 farm bill that would have reduced from 18 cents to 16 cents a
pound the price guaranteed to growers.
   That reduction, said the amendments' sponsors, would have
brought the support for sugar more in line with other government
farm programs, stopping unfair competition that is leading Midwest
wheat producers to fight off buy-out efforts by better-rewarded
sugar beet producers.

<TEXT>
   More than a year after revealing a probe of
the New York commodities pits, federal futures regulators have
charged four brokers with fraud in handling customer orders.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused the four, and a
firm owned by one of them, of non-competitively executing crude oil
futures trades for customers on the floor of the New York
Mercantile Exchange in lower Manhattan.
   The four, all registered with the CFTC as floor brokers, were
identified as Douglas M. Friedman, of Forest Hills, Queens, N.Y;
Michael S. Pomerantz, Scarsdale N.Y.; Lawrence A. Beck, Fort Lee,
N.J.; John J. King, Old Bridge, N.J.
   Also named in the nine-count administrative complaint disclosed
Tuesday was MSP Trading Inc. a firm owned by Pomerantz.
   Pomerantz, King and Beck were accused of deceiving and
defrauding customers by taking their orders to buy or sell and then
taking the opposite position _ at the customer's expense _
allegedly with Friedman's help. The moves would violate CFTC rules
that require a trader to submit customer orders to the general
marketplace.
   ``The investigation is continuing,'' said Dennis Klejna,
director of the CFTC's Enforcement Division. He said further
charges were ``certainly possible.''
   Pomerantz's lawyer, Barry Mandel, and King's lawyer, Ira Lee
Sorkin, both in New York said they had not seen the CFTC complaint
and therefore could not comment. Lawyers for the other defendants
were not in their offices when called for comment Tuesday night.
   The investigation came to light in May 1989 when the government
revealed it was conducting criminal and civil investigations of
alleged illegal trading at four New York commodities exchanges.
   The CFTC complaint alleged that the other three used Friedman,
who trades primarily for his own account, to circumvent CFTC rules
between July and December 1988.
   If an administrative law judge rules in favor of the CFTC, the
defendants could be subject to penalties ranging from suspension of
trading privileges to fines up to $100,000 per violation.
   The investigations are unrelated to a longstanding probe of
Chicago's commodity markets that yielded indictments against 48
people. Sixteen have pleaded guilty to lesser charges.
   Earlier this month, a federal jury convicted two Swiss franc
traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of relatively minor
trading violations and acquitted a third.
   The jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious
charges, including a racketeering count against one defendant and
mail and wire fraud charges against all three.
   Federal prosecutors have said they plan to refile the remaining
charges against the men, whose sentencings were tentatively
scheduled for November.

   Futures trading representatives testifying
before a Congressional panel praised so-called circuit breakers for
stopping Monday's plunge in the Dow Jones average of industrial
stocks.
   One day after the Dow fell more than 100 points in 90 minutes,
leaders of the nation's largest futures exchanges reported
favorably to the Senate Banking Committee on safeguards set up
after the 1987 stock market crash.
   ``Yesterday was a very good example of just how well the
circuit-breaker functions,'' Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, said Tuesday.
   The Dow drop helped cause a similar decline in the stock-index
futures market, where traders bet on the direction of stock prices
by buying and selling contracts based on market indexes.
   The price tumble tripped ``circuit-breakers'' on the Chicago
Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, prompting brief trading halts
that are designed as safeguards against a market crash.
   Merc officials, through an automated conference call, stayed in
touch with the other future exchanges on Monday, as they have done
in previous market drops, an official said before the hearing.
   Merc President William J. Brodsky said officials had several
conversations with New York Stock Exchange President Richard Grasso.
   Brodsky said the Chicago exchanges also were in touch with
federal regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
which in turn passed along pertinent information to the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which oversees the stock market.
   ``Yesterday was about as normal as you can expect for something
that's not normal,'' said Brodsky.
   The circuit breakers were put in place to forestall a collapse
like that of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones plummeted more than
500 points.
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks, the most widely watched
measure of the stock market's activity, dropped more than 100
points early Monday before regaining about half the loss to close
down 56 points.
   The New York Stock Exchange has asked its member firms for
voluntary compliance with a proposed temporary ban on computerized
selling tactics when the market rises or falls 50 points.
   An NYSE request for SEC approval of the voluntary program
trading halt proposal during volatile markets is to be taken up by
the commission in Washington on Wednesday.
   Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, noted the futures markets can be more attractive to
traders during a sudden downturn in the market.
   He said the circuit breakers appeared to be effective Monday,
and added: ``It seems to me that in effect that's also an implicit
argument that if there were no circuit breakers who knows what kind
of races we were off to yesterday.''
   Melamed said the circuit-breakers ``allowed the orders to
reaccumulate and rethink the situation and, in fact, stoppped the
market.''
   ``As you know, at the NYSE the market continued to go down long
afterward so that it took a while to effect the NYSE cash market,
eventually both markets steadied,'' he said.
   On the Big Board, trading would be suspended for one hour if the
Dow falls more than 250 points and two hours after another
150-point drop.
   The Chicago halts call for a 30-minute stoppage if the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-stock futures contract drops 12 points, the equivalent
of about 96 points in the Dow. The contract is not allowed to trade
at a lower price during that time period.
   Melamed and other futures and agricultural group leaders were in
Washington to oppose legislation that would strip the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission of authority over stock index futures
and give it to the SEC.
   The Bush administration has favored bills calling for such an
action, which are pending in both the House and Senate.
   After the hearing, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of
the banking panel's securities subcommittee, said there are
``conversations on a compromise'' ongoing although he declined to
say which senators were involved.
   ``I'm not sure it's going to bear any fruit; I'll be candid with
you about that,'' Dodd added. He also said that he didn't think the
issue of stock index futures was dead in this congressional session.

<HEAD>Trade Panel Finds No Cause to Limit Camera Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keystone Camera Products Corp. cannot blame a
flood of cheap foreign imports for its marketplace woes, a U.S.
trade panel said as it ruled out tariffs and import quotas.
   Keystone, of Clifton, N.J., claimed it is the sole remaining
American manufacturer of conventional 35mm fixed focus and
point-and-shoot cameras, and 110 pocket cameras. On that basis, it
asked for trade restraints on imports from Japan, China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Brazil.
   ``Imports of cameras were not a substantial cause of injury to
the domestic camera industry,'' the four members of the U.S.
International Trade Commission ruled Tuesday.
   ``Certainly, the quantity of imports as well as the price of the
imports had negative effects on the operations of Keystone,'' wrote
Commisioner David B. Rohr. ``I am forced to conclude however, that
these effects are dwarfed by other factors which have had much more
profound negative effects on Keystone.''
   In particular, he cited failed marketing strategies and a failed
videotape venture.
   The firm, which produced 2.5 million cameras last year, said the
competition could jeopardize the future of 500 manufacturing and
distribution jobs in the depressed Clifton-Paterson area of New
Jersey.
   The company said that imports of the types of cameras it
produces, increased from 11 million in 1985 to 27.5 million in 1987
_ an increase of 150 percent.
   Its petition excludes imported disc, single-lens reflex, instant
print and imported 110 cameras that are not fixed focus.
   Myron J. Berman, chairman of Keystone, did not respond to
repeated phone calls.
   Berman had said earlier that without import restrictions,
Keystone would be forced to move its production facilities
overseas, as other camera makers have done. He said the company
already had cut costs to the bone.
   Keystone still could seek relief by charging that foreign
cameras have been dumped in the American marketplace at less than
fair-market value, said Betsy Godley, a spokesman for the trade
panel.
   Keystone received support from one member of New Jersey's
congressional delegation _ Sen. Bill Bradley _ after it petitioned
the International Trade Commission for help on March 29. It
received an extra boost from House Majority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri and House Majority Whip William H. Gray III of
Pennsylvania.
   Bradley, a Democrat and an opponent of protectionist trade
measures, had declined to sign the lawmakers' letter. He sent his
own to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, spokesman Michael
Jones had said.
   Giant camera maker Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., which
said it was not being hurt by imports, had asked the trade
commission to uphold free trade and deny relief to Keystone.
   Kodak argued that Keystone was responsible for its own market
troubles. It also had disputed Keystone's claim to be the last bona
fide American camera maker.

   Car and truck sales fell 13 percent in mid-July
compared with a strong results last year, marking a contrast with
the gains posted in each of the past two 10-day sales periods.
   ``I think what you're seeing in these June and July numbers is
some buying to take advantage of the incentives before they
expire,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service
Inc. of New York.
   Incentives in mid-July of last year pushed up the sales rate.
This year, incentives still are in effect, but automakers have been
trimming them back as their unsold new-vehicle inventories shrink.
   The 10 major U.S. vehicle manufacturers said they sold cars and
trucks at a combined average daily rate of 34,549 during the July
11-20 period this year compared with a daily average of 39,726
during the same time last year.
   Car sales fell 13.3 percent and truck sales dropped 12.6 percent.
   Counted separately, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. said their car sales during the period fell 17.8
percent while sales of cars made by Japanese companies in the
United States rose 23 percent.
   The Big Three held 84.5 percent of the car market during the
period while the transplants had the rest.
   Auto industry observers are looking closely at the sales rates
in July after the pace of vehicle sales began picking up in late
June. Analysts have said it's too soon to tell if the industry is
beginning a rebound as some of them predicted for the second half
of 1990.
   ``I think the market is pointed in that direction,'' said Herb
Adcox, owner of Adcox Chevrolet in Chattanooga, Tenn. ``Everyone
seems to think that things turned at the last of June and the first
week of July.
   ``The second week of July, it just slowed down. I don't know
why,'' he said.
   So far this year, the car and truck sales pace was running 3.6
percent below last year's, with car sales down 4.8 percent and
truck sales off 1.6 percent.
   During the past two 10-day sales periods, automakers and
analysts have been mildly surprised at the strength in the market,
given a generally sluggish economy. Analysts have said they want to
see how the sales trend runs over a longer period before
speculating on what may be driving the market.
   There have been some early theories that the glut of new cars
and trucks bought in the mid-1980s are beginning to age, and owners
may be trading them in.
   Ford said its car sales plunged 24.6 percent in mid-July this
year and truck sales fell 10.4 percent. That combined for an 18.8
percent decline in vehicle sales in mid-July.
   So far this year, Ford's car and truck sales were running 8
percent behind last year's pace.
   Chrysler's North American-made cars and trucks were selling at a
rate 17.2 percent behind last year's clip in mid-July as car sales
dropped 17.9 percent and truck sales, which include the company's
profitable Jeeps and minivans, fell 16.7 percent.
   For the year, car and truck sales for Chrysler were running 13.4
percent behind last year's rate.
   GM said its mid-July vehicle sales were running 13.3 percent
behind last year, with car sales dropping 13.4 percent and truck
sales falling 13.2 percent. For the year, GM's cars and trucks were
selling at a rate 3.6 percent behind last year.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for second 10-day period in July 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year, and 170 selling days so far this year,
compared with 169 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant cars.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and

   OPEC ministers today sought a way to boost oil
prices and defuse tensions in the Persian Gulf, where Iraq has
threatened military action against Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates for exceeding production quotas.
   Members declined to discuss Iraq's threats in advance of a
meeting of the cartel's eight-member monitoring committee later
today.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
formally begins its mid-year conference Thursday.
   Kuwait's new oil minister, Rasheed Salem al-Ameeri, declined to
comment on reports that Iraq has massed tens of thousands of troops
on its border with Kuwait, or on earlier Iraqi threats.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh expressed confidence
the cartel would agree to increase its target price, now at $18 a
barrel, to $20 or more.
   ``I am in favor of any price that is higher than what we have
now,'' Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said upon
arrival this morning.
   Asked about the effect of the Persian Gulf tensions on the
meeting, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said Tuesday, ``We are an
economics organization. We talk about economics.''
   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said, ``We are here to
solve oil problems.''
   Even Iraq's oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, confined
his public remarks to oil prices. He pushed his proposal to lift
the cartel's target price to $25 a barrel by cutting OPEC
production.
   He refused to discuss the reports of Iraqi troop movements.
   The troop movements coincide with threats last week by President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq to take military action against countries
producing oil in excess of their OPEC-set caps.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have stubbornly refused in
the past to limit crude output to their quotas. A sharp fall in oil
prices in the spring was largely blamed on too much oil on the
world market.
   Saddam claimed Iraq, badly in need of money to repair damage
from its 8-year war with Iran, has lost $14 billion in oil revenues
during the last year because of falling prices.
   Iraqi officials also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion
worth of oil from wells in the border area that they claim are in
Iraqi territory.
   Word of the Iraqi troops sent oil prices higher Tuesday. The
September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude, rose 6 cents to settle at $20.56 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, called for agreement on a higher
target price.
   Libyan Oil Minister Fawzi Shakshuki also said he would like
prices to go up to $25 a barrel. But he said the cartel ``would
have been there now'' had prices remained at the strong levels
posted in January.
   The average price for seven crudes monitored by the cartel
reached $20.46 in early January but plunged to $13.64 a barrel less
than six months later.
   It has since rebounded to $16.25 a barrel.
   OPEC accounts for major portion of world oil output and a cartel
price rise would affect the price at the pump in the United States,
which imports about half the oil it consumes.
   Two OPEC price shocks in the 1970s sent the U.S. economy
reeling. But recent OPEC accords _ and prices _ have been
undermined by members' departures from their assigned quotas.
   A confidential report, prepared by OPEC's secretariat in Vienna,
was understood to say the value of the cartel's target price has
been sharply eroded by inflation and exchange rate fluctuations.
   According to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the
market report estimated the cartel's target price slipped from
about $16 a barrel in January to about $11 last month.
   To try to pump up prices, the ministers were expected to agree
to a proposal worked out by Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf
producers to trim output so total production is limited to about
22.5 million barrels a day in the coming months.
   Nazer said he was confident that OPEC would strike such a deal.
   The OPEC market report, according to the sources, estimated the
group's output at 23.5 million barrels a day in the April-June
quarter of the year.
   Demand for the cartel's oil was estimated to run at 21.8 million
barrels a day in the July-September quarter, climbing to 24.4
million barrels in the final three months of last year year, said
the sources.
   Under the Persian Gulf proposal, Kuwait and the U.A.E. would
pledge to hold output to 1.5 million barrels a day each. They have
each been pumping as much as 2 million barrels a day.
   Kuwait's quota now stands at 1.5 million barrels a day and the
U.A.E.'s at 1.1 million barrels.
   Under the proposed arrangement, only U.A.E. would see its supply
target increase; the other producers would remain at current levels.
   OPEC's members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and
Venezuela.

   Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday on
London's Stock Exchange as investors worried about British
corporate earnings.
   Shares rose strongly early in the session, but then weakened in
thin trading, dealers said.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 10.1 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,371.0, near the morning
low of 2,369.4 and off from the high of 2,382.5.
   Volume came to 270.5 million shares at midday, compared with 233
million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   Some institutions have been selective buyers of stocks such as
food retailers and oil companies, dealers said.
   They said oil stocks were the most active, underpinned by
expectations that the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries which starts Thursday would manage to cut back
production and push up crude oil prices.

<HEAD>British Government Clears British Airways Stake in Sabena</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government on Wednesday cleared
British Airways PLC's planned linkup with the Belgian carrier
Sabena World Airlines.
   The European Commission previously objected to the deal.
   The decision announced Wednesday by Britain's Department of
Trade and Ministry follows a British Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation which found that British Airways' intended
20 percent stake in Sabena wouldn't operate against the public
interest.
   The Sabena deal also calls for KLM Royal Dutch Airways to take a
20 percent stake in the Belgian airline, which would be 60
percent-owned by the Belgian government-controlled parent company
Sabena SA.
   British Airways and KLM were each to pay about $62 million for
their stakes.
   The European Commission, which safeguard's competition in
Europe, decided in June that the deal could hurt competition at the
Brussels airport, and the original agreement now is to be
renegotiated through talks with the EC.
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission found in its investigation
that British air travelers would benefit from a Brussels-based
hub-and-spoke system the airlines want to set up.
   The joint venture would increase choices available on
intercontinental flights, the department quoted the commission as
saying.
   The monopolies commission also found that British Airways and
Sabena, currently the only airlines serving Brussels from London's
Heathrow airport, would be no more likely than before to raise
prices on the route under the new agreement. Pricing on the route
is governed by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
   The monopolies commission also found that the CAA would be in a
position to restrain Sabena from gaining any future competitive
advantage in serving London's other airports from Brussels.
   The monopolies commission's report made no comment about the
EC's findings. However, the department noted that the British
government's investigation recognized that the ``greater part of
the effects of the arrangements lie outside'' Britain.
   British Airways, welcoming the department's decision, said it
was confident that the EC also would ``respond positively to this
pan-European inititiative.''

<HEAD>Toledo, Chrysler Reach Agreement on Jeep Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and local and state officials
announced today an agreement to bring more Jeep production and
possibly hundreds of jobs to Toledo.
   Company spokesman Michael Glusac said Chrysler will move
production of the Wrangler YJ from Brampton, Ontario, to Toledo
starting Jan. 1, 1993.
   The company also said that if it decides to build the new JJ
model, it would be produced in Toledo by 1993.
   In return, the city and state will provide an incentive package
that could total $22.5 million over the next 10 years.
   ``The agreement meets Chrysler's needs as well as the needs of
the city and state for a framework for determining the future of
Jeep in Toledo,'' Glusac said at a news conference.
   ``Market conditions must ultimately govern our decisions about
what vehicles we make, where we make them and in what volume.
However, the agreement being announced gives us assurances about
what Chrysler can expect in the years ahead,'' he said.
   The company already makes the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer
in Toledo.
   Mayor John McHugh said he would ask the City Council to grant
Chrysler a 10-year tax abatement on personal property taxes on an
estimated $75 million worth of equipment the company expects to
install at its two Toledo plants. The equipment would be for
production of both vehicles.
   The city agreed to provide up to $500,000 a year for seven years
starting in 1991 for improvements to the plants.
   The state agreed to provide up to $5 million for retraining
workers.
   ``This is a major triumph for business, labor and government in
northwest Ohio,'' Gov. Richard Celeste said. ``In a true
partnership, we have worked to extend Chrysler's commitment to
produce the Cherokee at the Toledo Jeep facilities. And returning
the production of the Wrangler to Toledo will reassure that
Chrysler Jeep will continue to play an important economic role in
the community.''
   The agreement is the final piece of a package that was needed to
move Jeep Wrangler production to Toledo from Brampton and keep the
two local plants operating beyond 1992. The two plants currently
employ 5,300 people.
   The first part was reached last month when Chrysler reached a
seven-year contract with United Auto Workers Local 12. The contract
contained a number of work rule changes to make the plants more
efficient.
   However, Chrysler said it would not move Wrangler production to
the city until an agreement was reached on an incentive package.
   In April, several Toledo area officials, including U.S. Rep.
Marcy Kaptur and Mayor John McHugh, said Chrysler would move the
Wrangler and build a new Jeep line in Toledo, which would create
between 1,200 and 1,600 jobs.
   While Chrysler officials told Local 12 the Wrangler would be
coming to Toledo, the company said it was re-evaluating plans to
build the ``JJ'' model, a small sport-utility vehicle made in a
joint venture with the French automaker Renault.
   Chrysler also told the union that, in all likelihood, no new
jobs would be created. The transfer of Wrangler to Toledo would
offset the projected decline in sales of the Jeep Cherokees and
Grand Wagoneers.
   However, union officials said despite Chrysler's projections,
they felt Wrangler production would create 1,200 jobs in Toledo.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving steadily toward passing a
five-year farm bill that generally maintains current law and
preserves most of the government's farm support systems, including
the hotly debated sugar program.
   During a marathon session that began Tuesday morning and lasted
until nearly midnight, the Senate defeated one challenge after
another to the bill worked out by its agriculture committee.
   The price support system protecting honey producers is the only
program that has been eliminated so far. Opponents of the peanut
program were mounting their offensive today.
   The House also was protecting the work of its committee as it
defeated efforts to change the dairy and sugar programs.
   Opponents of the present sugar program wanted to change the
support price from 18 cents a pound to 16 cents, a proposal also
supported by the Bush administration.
   That reduction would have brought the support for sugar more in
line with other government farm programs, easing the struggle
between Midwestern grain farmers and the better-rewarded sugar beet
producers threatening to buy them out, amendment supporters said.
   ``Wheat farmers and barley farmers support the sugar program,''
Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said sarcastically. ``They would like to
have one like it.''
   Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., called sugar producers ``the most
pampered farmers in America ... and the most profitable.''
   Bradley also said the quota system used to control the amount of
foreign sugar sold in the United States hurts poor Latin American
countries receiving foreign aid.
   He said some of those countries are trying to find alternatives
to coca, the raw material for cocaine, and would benefit from more
open markets in the United States.
   ``The coca price is below the break-even point,'' said Bradley.
``This is an opportunity for us to begin to wean some of these
countries from coca production into other crops, particularly
sugar.''
   Supporters said the program was needed to preserve American jobs
and provide price stability. They said that even if the support
price were reduced, consumers would not see any difference in the
price of products containing sugar.
   ``To say this can be passed on to the American housewife is the
wildest speculation,'' said Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn. ``All
this will do is put more money in the hands of the manufacturer who
is using sugar.''
   An amendment by Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to increase target
prices on wheat and feed grains for smaller producers lost, 72-24.
   Daschle said it was needed to keep 500,000 family farms from
going out of business during the five-year life of the bill. It
would have put target prices on a two-tier system in an effort to
get more money for small and medium-sized farms without going over
budget.
   For example, instead of freezing the target price on wheat at $4
a bushel as called for in the bill, Daschle would have farmers
receiving $4.10 a bushel for the first 12,500 bushels of wheat, and
$3.40 for every subsequent bushel.
   Similar adjustments would be made for corn, oats, sorghum and
barley, which also are frozen at current levels in the bill.
   Opponents of the amendment, including Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said it would destroy the compromise
worked out by the panel, possibly preventing passage of the whole
bill.
   In other action, the Senate:
   _Approved an amendment that prevents fruits, vegetables,
potatoes and edible beans from being grown on acreage that is
covered by the flexibility provisions of the bill's subsidy program.
   _Defeated a plan to allow foreign vessels to be used if no
U.S.-flagged vessels are available for food aid shipments to
foreign countries.
   The House, meanwhile:
   _Defeated an amendment that would have allowed the Agriculture
Department to reduce the milk price support level if surpluses
exceeded 5 billion pounds in any year.
   _Approved a provision to prevent states from imposing any
surcharge for milk processing greater than the federal government's.
   _Voted to allow grazing on land that is set aside under the
cotton acreage reduction program.
   _Approved disaster payments to cotton producers who are
prevented from planting because of Indian water rights disputes.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise On Tight Soyoil Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a rally led by the
soybean complex following a government report showing unexpectedly
low soybean oil stocks.
   The Census Bureau's weekly soybean crush report showed U.S.
soyoil stocks at 1.4 billion pounds, which was about 100 million
pounds below market expectations and 1.3 billion pounds below the
year-ago level.
   William Biedermann, research director with the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc., said the report suggests the amount of
soybean oil on hand Sept. 30, the end of the current marketing
year, could be at the lowest year-end level in history.
   Soybeans were further supported by McDonald's Corp.'s
announcement that it will switch to all vegetable oil from beef fat
for making french fries, some analysts said.
   Soybean meal stocks also were below expectations at about
263,000 tons.
   Biedermann said new export demand for U.S. corn helped boost
corn futures, although gains were kept in check by expectations for
more beneficial crop weather in the Midwest.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.04\ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to } cent higher with September at $2.61{ a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent higher with September at $1.29 a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with August at
$5.86\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, paced by sharp gains in the pork-belly
market on continued strength in the cash market.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .45 cent higher with August at
77.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .50 cent
higher with August at 88.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent
to .95 cent higher with August at 60.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.7 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with August at
47.12 cents a pound.
   Most livestock and meat futures rose on Tuesday.

   Sunday has never been a day of leisure
at the International Paper mill that dominates this historic
Adirondack Mountain village.
   The workers liked it that way because they got paid double time.
But the paper company, embroiled in a bitter labor dispute with the
union representing nearly 700 of the mill's 850 employees, recently
decreed it will only pay straight time for Sunday work.
   The workers are entering their third year without a contract.
The United Paperworkers International Union says there is nothing
it can do to reverse the company's decision to eliminate premium
pay without a contract in place.
   The company says it needs wage and benefit concessions from
workers to stay competitive. The company has already eliminated
time-and-a-half pay for holidays.
   ``I've negotiated a lot of contracts over the years, and I've
never seen the company negotiate in the style it does now, and its
style is, `take it or leave it,''' said Robert Blaise Jr., a past
president and current recording secretary of UPIU Local 497.
   Negotiations have deadlocked. Morale, the union claims, has
slumped.
   ``It's deteriorated to the point where no one gives a damn,''
Blaise said.
   Dan Fitzgerald, a truck driver at the mill, said, ``it's
rock-bottom. It's like Stalag 13.''
   ``It's difficult for everybody in a period like this, but ... we
continue doing our jobs and are committed to creating a good
product in a safe environment,'' said Dale N. Sutherland, an
International Paper spokesman.
   Company officials, union leaders and village authorities differ
over what effect the contract dispute has had on the community. But
all agree that International Paper means a great deal to
Ticonderoga.
   ``I'd shudder at the thought if International Paper ever had
massive layoffs,'' said Kitty J. Garrand, executive director of the
Ticonderoga Area Chamber of Commerce.
   ``Without IP you might as well lock your doors,'' said a sales
clerk in a retail clothing shop on Montcalm Street, Ticonderoga's
main drag.
   International Paper has been Ticonderoga's chief employer since
1925. It is also one of the world's largest paper manufacturers
with 67,000 employees worldwide, 55,000 of them in the United
States.
   The Ticonderoga mill pumps millions of dollars into the local
economy, including $22 million a year in wages for its 655 hourly
employees, Sutherland said.
   Ticonderogans are sensitive to anything concerning the company.
They watched uncomfortably as nearly 2,100 UPIU members lost their
jobs to replacement workers in a 16-month strike at IP mills in
Jay, Maine; De Pere, Wis.; and Lock Haven, Pa. Between 1,800 and
1,900 of them remain out of work, said Gordon Brehm, spokesman for
the UPIU in Nashville, Tenn.
   Worries that replacement workers would be used locally peaked
last winter when more than 1,000 non-union workers arrived to fill
temporary maintenance and construction jobs at the mill during its
annual shutdown.
   The non-union workers were employed by BE&amp;K Construction Co., a
Birmingham, Ala., contractor that supplied International Paper with
replacement workers during the strike.
   Using BE&amp;K workers in Ticonderoga was a humiliation for the
union.
   ``We don't believe in the credo of using non-union help and we
don't believe they should be working in this mill,'' said Blaise.
   BE&amp;K workers rented every available apartment and motel room in
Ticonderoga and surrounding towns, pumping money into an area
desperate for extra dollars when the summer tourist season ends.
But the workers _ dubbed ``beakers'' by the UPIU _ were blamed for
what passes for a crime wave in this rural community near the
Vermont line.
   Two BE&amp;K employees were accused of sexually assaulting a female
co-worker, while another was charged with stabbing to death his
roommate, also a BE&amp;K worker, in the nearby town of Schroon. It was
the first murder there since the early 1950s, police said.
   At the union hall, a door is decorated with a mock wanted poster
depicting a rat in a police lineup with the words ``BE&amp;K worker''
underneath. The last of the BE&amp;K workers left the area in late
April and ``it's business as usual around the community,'' Garrand
said.
   Contention is nothing new in Ticonderoga.
   Located on the southern reaches of Lake Champlain and the
northern shore of Lake George, Ticonderoga's name comes from the
Iroquois ``cheonderoga,'' or ``the place between two lakes.''
   It became a strategic portage for generations of marauding
Indians and later French, British and American explorers and
soldiers who fought for control of Fort Ticonderoga, a 235-year-old
stone fortress outside the village.
   The union, which last struck International Paper locally in the
early 1970s to protest allegedly unsafe working conditions, said
there is no justification for cutting pay or seeking wage
concessions since the company is so profitable. In 1989
International Paper reported record earnings of $864 million.
   The company contends the paper industry is in a down trend and
the pay concessions are necessary if the company wants to stay
competitive in the world market.
   Of International Paper's 22 major paper manufacturing mills,
four are operating without union contracts. The company negotiates
each mill's contract separately, so if some are halted by strikes
others keep running.
   ``When you've got 30, 40, 50 mills with no contracts ... you
might have more bargaining power,'' said James W. De Zalia,
president of Local 497.
   Union officials in Ticonderoga say profits have come at their
expense, although mill wages are far above the average for the
region. Ticonderoga mill workers average about $13.50 per hour and
the average annual pay for hourly employees is approximately
$35,000.
   But De Zalia said the workers hardly have an easy life.
   ``We work seven-days stretches, holidays, Sundays,'' De Zalia
said. ``You work around chemicals and all the hazards'' of factory
work, he said.
   Last January, union members voted 453 to 67 to reject the latest
company offer. No negotiations have been held since. The company
refuses to discuss specifics of the contract dispute.
   The cuts in premium pay and an increase in health insurance
deductions have cost workers thousands of dollars a year, De Zalia
said. That translates into fewer dollars spent at local businesses,
he said.
   ``As for buying cars, building new homes, it has to have an
effect,'' De Zalia said. ``After all these years, all of a sudden
they take it right away from you.''
   ``I didn't have a chance for college. But I want to make sure my
kids have a chance to go,'' Fitzgerald said. ``It's going to be a
burden.''
   But the workers are apprehensive about challenging the company.
   ``Hopefully the company will say, `hey, let's settle before
something happens,''' De Zalia said. ``Nobody wants to strike.
Nobody wins. Everybody loses in a strike.''

<HEAD>Australian Truck Plant Selects Site Near Toledo</HEAD>

   An Australian company will make an
innovative pickup truck in the Toledo suburb of Northwood in a $225
million venture that will create 1,500 jobs, a company official
announced today.
   Kelpie North America Corp. expects to build 60,000
hydraulic-lift pickup trucks a year for the U.S. market. The
company is a subsidiary of Sydney, Australia-based Kelpie
Industries Ltd.
   The company has developed more than 20 prototypes for the truck
in the last three years. The truck features a bed and tailgate that
lower to the ground.
   ``Our company is confident that we have chosen the best possible
site to meet our production needs to launch our products in North
America,'' Paul Cooper, president of Kelpie North America. Corp.,
said at a news conference with Wood County commissioners in Bowling
Green, the county seat.
   A Canadian site also was under consideration.
   ``Major contributing factors were strong community support and
an excellent local, skilled labor pool,'' Cooper said.
   The company expects to begin construction this summer at a
70-acre site.
   The truck will carry a price tag of $16,500 to $17,900,
depending on options, the company said.
   The one-ton, front-wheel-drive truck has no rear axle; the
wheels are mounted directly to the frame. The load tray, known as
the bed, raises and lowers hydraulically, making it easy for people
to place heavy objects in the truck.
   Most of the prototypes were built in Australia, but labor
difficulties there and the potential size of the North American
market led Kelpie to seek a site in the United States or Canada,
the company said.
   In addition to the 1,500 jobs that would be created at the
plant, another 4,500 related jobs could be created in the area, the
company has said.
   The first vehicle could roll off the assembly line in about 12
to 14 months, the company said.

<HEAD>Norfolk Southern Earnings Drop 10.2 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norfolk Southern Corp. said Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings fell 10.2 percent from a year earlier, when
the company had a one-time $13.6 million gain.
   The railroad and transportation company said it earned $155.9
million, or 95 cents per share, down from $173.7 million, or 99
cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue totaled $1.18 billion, up from $1.17 billion in the
comparable 1989 period.
   The drop in earnings was attributed in part to the $13.6 million
after-tax gain that inflated Norfolk Southern's 1989 second-quarter
earnings. The gain came from the sale of a portion of Norfolk
Southern's trailer train holdings.
   The company also said some of its segments suffered a drop in
revenue or had an increase in expenses, but the firm gave no other
reasons for the income decline. Spokesman Bob Auman said earnings
are affected by a number of factors including fuel costs.
   For the first half, Norfolk Southern said it earned $296.1
million, or $1.79 a share, down 3.7 percent from $307.5 million, or
$1.74 a share, in the first six months of 1989.
   First-half revenue totaled $2.32 billion, up from $2.29 billion
in 1989.

   The parent of USAir said it lost $75 million in the most recent
three-month period, attributing the drop to weakness in the
nation's economy.
   America West Airlines said it registered second-quarter profits
of more than $6 million, nearly double its earnings in the same
period last year, as it dramatically increased its passenger miles.

   USAir Group Inc., based in Arlington, Va., said its quarterly
loss, equal to $1,86 a share, compared with profits of $101
million, of $2.29 a share, in the second quarter of 1989.
   Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 was $1.71 billion, down
slightly from $1.73 billion a year earlier.
   ``Revenue growth has been below expectations,'' USAir Group
Chairman and President Edwin I. Colodny said in a statement.
   He said industry-wide domestic capacity was growing faster than
traffic and widespread promotional fare cuts on both coasts had
reduced per passenger yields.
   For the first half of 1990, USAir reported a net loss of $113
million, or $2.92 a share, on revenue of $3.3 billion, compared
with net income of $116 million, or $2.65 a share, on revenue of
$3.2 billion in the same time last year.

   America West posted second-quarter earnings of $6.14 million, or
29 cents a share, compared with $3.03 million, or 14 cents a share,
during the second quarter of 1989. Revenue rose 37 percent to $326
million from $239 million a year earlier.
   The results reflect a major improvement over the first quarter
of the year, when the airline reported a net loss of $2.6 million.
   Al Frei, senior vice president of finance, said much of the
improvement was due to a substantial drop in the fuel costs.
   ``Fuel prices ... were more than 10 cents per gallon lower than
during the first quarter of the year,'' he said.
   Phoeniz-based America West reported a 49.9 percent increase in
passenger miles in the second quarter over the same quarter last
year, Frei said.
   The airline increased its passenger capacity during the quarter
by 33.4 percent, primarily by adding twice-daily Boeing 747 service
between Phoenix and Honolulu.
   For the first half of 1990, America West reported net earnings
of $3.6 million, or 18 cents a share, down from $13.1 million, or
64 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.
   Half-year revenue was $631 million, up from $472 million a year
ago.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed Wednesday in dealings in
Europe, rising against the British pound and the Japanese yen but
falling against other major currencies.
   Gold prices rose in Europe.
   The dollar was helped against the yen by jitters over rising
tensions in the Persian Gulf which also has helped boost world oil
prices. The situation has undermined some confidence in the
oil-import dependent Japanese economy.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 149.13 Japanese yen from
148.70 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 148.75
yen. At midday in New Yor, the dollar was quoted at 149.25 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar still is under pressure aginst the mark
and most other currencies because of concerns that U.S. interest
rates will fall.
   The dollar was also pushed down by weaker-than-expected U.S.
durable goods orders for June, which raised chances the Federal
Reserve will encourage lower interest rates to stimulate the
economy.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8125 from $1.8250 late
Tuesday. In New York, the dollar traded for $1.81085 at midday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.6170 West German marks, down from 1.6185;
1.3715 Swiss francs, down from 1.3750; 5.4185 French francs, down
from 5.4275; 1.8215 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8230; 1,183.62
Italian lire, down from 1,184.75, and 1.1518 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1557.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $373.25 a troy ounce, up
from $368.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of
$372.50 an ounce, up from $368.35 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.42 to close at $367.83 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $4.89 a troy
ounce, up from $4.85 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and several of its top managers
were indicted today on criminal charges of falsifying aircraft
maintenance records and other aircraft-safety documents.
   The 60-count indictment alleges a fraudulent scheme to try to
minimize flight delays and cancellations that resulted in flights
by improperly maintained or repaired airplanes.
   The violations allegedly took place from July 1985 to October
1989 at John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports in New
York, Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta and Eastern
headquarters in Miami.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that the
alleged conspiracy ``strikes a raw nerve in anyone who has ever
boarded an airplane.''
   ``Thousands of innocent passengers may have been put at risk
every day by the criminal actions of these defendants,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Eastern faces a maximum fine of $30 million. Each individual
defendant faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
each count.
   The indictment charges that by tampering with log books, work
cards and maintenance records Eastern ``did cause aircraft that
were not properly maintained or repaired to fly and carry
unsuspecting passengers.''
   None of the alleged violations caused any accidents or injuries,
authorities said.
   The airline and nine employees were charged with conspiracy,
fraud, keeping false records, concealing information from the
Federal Aviation Administration and other charges.
   The charges follow a year-long federal investigation and the
collapse of plea bargain talks in which Eastern refused to admit to
conspiracy charges.
   Martin Shugrue, appointed to run Eastern by a bankruptcy judge,
said Tuesday the airline was prepared to admit to fraudulent
maintenance and record-keeping but not conspiracy.
   Andrew J. Maloney, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said the
charges involved ``critical items'' including radar, landing gear,
automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems.
   The indictment alleges Eastern and several managers used
``intimidation and coercion'' to force the airline's maintenance
personnel to avoid and minimize flight delays and cancellations.
   It accuses Eastern and the workers of falsifying aircraft
maintenance records ``to make it fraudulently appear that scheduled
maintenance and corrective repairs had been completed.''
   In addition to the airline, named in the indictment were Edward
Upton, Eastern's staff vice president of maintenance and
engineering during the period; Thomas Lewis, Eastern's northern
area director of maintenance; and seven other maintenance
supervisors and foremen.
   A criminal indictment is unprecedented in the airline industry
and could add to Eastern's woes as it seeks to regain passengers,
build service and reorganize under federal bankruptcy protection
after a bitter strike.
   ``I think the public will recognize these are historical events
that don't bear on Eastern today,'' said Shugrue, who has run the
airline for about three months.
   Shugrue said Eastern has undergone and passed a ``rigorous
inspection'' by the FAA and the Defense Department. He called
Eastern ``the most-inspected air carrier in the world.''
   In refusing to acknowledge the conspiracy charge, Shugrue said,
``We cannot and will not plead guilty to violations of the law for
which we find no evidence.''
   The criminal investigation began last year after the FAA fined
Eastern $839,000 for alleged maintenance violations, primarily at
Kennedy.
   Eastern cooperated with that investigation and closed its
maintenance facility at Kennedy last year.
   Shugrue said Eastern expected to turn a profit in 1991. The
Miami-based airline is projected to lose about $500 million this
year after a $852 million loss in 1989.
   Eastern's employees struck the airline March 4, 1989, and the
company filed for bankruptcy protection five days later. Pilots and
flight attendants quit the strike several months later but the
mechanics remain on strike.
   A federal bankruptcy judge appointed Shugrue on April 18 to run
the airline in place of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's
parent company, the former Texas Air Corp., now known as
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as late profit-taking
erased modest gains posted earlier in the session.
   The corn and soybean markets appear to be consolidating after
dropping sharply and then rebounding on Monday.
   William Biedermann, research director at the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc., said Monday's apparent reversal might
indicate the beginning of an upward move, but traders weren't sure
enough to take large positions.
   ``Typically, you spend a couple of days trying to confirm
whether it is a reversal or not, so we could chop around here for a
while,'' Biedermann said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.02 a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1\ cents lower with September at $2.60{ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1\ cents higher with September at $1.29 a bushel;
soybeans were 4 cents lower to { cent higher with August at $5.83{

<HEAD>Takeover Investors Apparently Win Key Votes in Battle For Control</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. said Wednesday an
investor group trying to wrest control of the troubled former steel
giant evidently had enough shareholder votes to fill three seats on
the 10-member board of directors.
   ``Our tally shows that we don't have enough votes to elect our
directors,'' Chief Executive Officer Howard M. Love told a news
conference after the company's annual shareholders' meeting.
   The vote appeared to be a significant victory in a prolonged
battle for control of the company by Centaur Partners, a New York
investment concern and NII's largest stockholder with 16.5 percent
of its shares.
   With three seats on the board, Centaur could wield enormous
influence in convincing the other board members to follow its plan
to sell what's left of NII and give the money to shareholders.
   Management has proposed a different future for NII, formerly a
debt-ridden steel company that diversified then sold most assets to
pay creditors. Under the management plan, NII would be restructured
as a wholesale drug distributor. NII's owns FoxMeyer Drug, the
nation's third-largest drug distributor.
   About 200 stockholders and proxies were present to select three
new directors. Candidate slates were nominated by the company and
Centaur.
   The results of voting won't be known until the shareholders'
meeting reconvenes Aug. 9. But Centaur appeared confident it had
won.
   ``This was an absolutely tremendous outpouring of support,''
said Centaur principal Abbey J. Butler.
   ``We do think that the shareholder vote is a mandate,'' said
Centaur principal Melvyn J. Estrin. They declined to say how many
votes they believed Centaur had.
   Love's seat on the board was one of those at stake. He had said
he would retire once the company's restructuring was complete but
said Wednesday he would step down March 1.
   Robert King, president of FoxMeyer, tried to persuade
shareholders to back NII's restructuring plan. He said the
wholesale drug distribution industry was a $25 billion a year
business and growing by 15 percent annually.
   Eugene Cohen, one of a few shareholders who addressed Love
during the meeting, said stockholders have not shared in profits
from the sale of NII assets or received dividends.
   ``What incentive is there to buy stock in Intergroup?'' Cohen
said.
   Walker Street Associates, which owns 8.4 percent of NII stock,
objected to increases in NII management's severance, pension and
stock option plans.
   ``Most shareholders have been looking for the company to tell
them something other than `trust us,' '' said Steve Mizel, a Walker
official.
   The dissidents' slate was Estrin; Robert J. Slater, former CEO
of CF&amp;I Steel Corp.; and William G. Tull, retired chief operating
officer of American Security Bank in Maryland, where Estrin is a
director.
   The seven remaining directors include five independents as well
as NII President James S. Pasman Jr. and Richard S. Smith, director
of The Permian Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NII.
   The next directors' meeting is scheduled for Aug. 22.

Area</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pacific Telesis Group and Cellular
Communications Inc. said Wednesday they have agreed to combine
cellular telephone operations in the Midwest, creating the third
largest regional cellular system in the U.S.
   The joint venture must be approved by shareholders and
regulators. The deal would combine Cellular One and PacTel
Cellular, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group.
   Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacific
Telesis Group, said the company had been looking for a way to
expand its cellular telephone operation for some time in the United
States and abroad.
   ``The mega-system created by this joint venture will virtually
double the number of customers we reach in the Midwest,'' Ginn said.
   The combined entity would cover a 27,000-square-mile area that
includes Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Detroit and
Toledo, where 15 million people live.
   George Blumenthal, chairman of Cellular Communications, said the
joint venture would make it easier to provide better cellular
telephone service in Ohio and Michigan.
   ``We think we'll work well as a team,'' he said.
   The deal is expected to close by the second or third quarter of
1991 if approved by CCI shareholders and state and federal
regulators.
   Under the deal, Pacific Telesis will purchase 5 percent of CCI
stock for $39 per share. It will have the right to increase its
percentage ownership for several years and then possibly acquire
the rest of CCI's stock after 5{ years.
   PacTel Cellular, which has 443,000 subscribers, serves the
greater Detroit-Toledo area under the name Cellular One and the
company operates in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and
Atlanta.
   CCI is the leading provider of cellular service in Ohio and
operates in Puerto Rico.
   Before closing the deal, CCI plans to spin off to its
shareholders two new public companies comprising CCI's
international activities and its long distance-microwave business.
After closing, CCI plans to spin off to shareholders a third public
company with its Puerto Rican cellular interests.

   Stock prices struggled to a small gain
Wednesday, extending their cautious comeback from the selloff that
swept through the market at the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.42 to 2,930.94.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
895 up, 583 down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.53 million
shares, down from 181.92 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 196.44 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged by the market's steady
showing since it ran into a barrage of sell orders in early trading
on Monday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 100 points at
its low point Monday, later trimmed its loss for that session to
56.44 points. On Tuesday it rose 17.82 points.
   Beyond that, brokers said hopes for lower interest rates were
buttressed by a new statistical sign of weakness in business
activity. The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders
for durable goods fell 3.2 percent in June.
   At the same time, however, the data did nothing to dispel recent
worries over a sluggish, erratic pattern in corporate profits.
   Investors' ``bargain-hunting'' mood was evident in several of
the depressed bank stocks, which have been battered by worries
about loan risks and talk of a credit crunch.
   Chase Manhattan, the most active Big Board issue, rose | to 20&rsqb;;
Citicorp &rsqb; to 21; Chemical Banking \ to 24&lsqb;; Manufacturers Hanover
} to 31\, and J.P. Morgan &rsqb; to 37&lsqb;.
   Elsewhere, DuPont climbed { to 39&rsqb;. The company posted
second-quarter profits of $1.02 a share, up from $1 a share in the
corresponding period last year.
   Baker Hughes, which more than doubled its earnings in the fiscal
quarter ended June 30, added \ to 30&lsqb;, trading at a new 52-week
high.
   But other energy stocks turned mostly lower after taking a
leading role in Tuesday's advance. Exxon dropped &rsqb; to 49|; Texaco \
to 62\; Mobil 1 to 66; Amoco 1 to 53~, and Chevron 1 to 77}.
   L.A. Gear fell 2&lsqb; to 23 in selling ascribed to a reduction in at
least one analyst's earnings estimate.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $11.38 billion, or
0.34 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.65 to 195.10..
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index gained 1.41 to 423.11, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.30 at 357.09.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rallied 2.89 to 445.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 356.95, up 1.44.

   Gold futures prices rose substantially Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, but although the market closed well below the
day's highs analysts said the recent rally appeared likely to
continue.
   On other commodity markets, other precious metals rose; copper
futures advanced; energy futures fell; livestock and meat futures
were higher; and grains and soybean retreated.
   Gold futures settled $3.80 to $4.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in August at $372.40 a troy ounce and the spot July
contract at $372, the highest settlement for spot gold since May 22.
   The rally erased Tuesday's moderate losses and pushed prices
beyond the highs posted Monday, when August gold soared $7.70.
   August gold traded as high as $375.50 early in Wednesday's
session, boosted by indications of Middle Eastern buying and by
speculation that the simmering dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over
crude oil could boil over into armed conflict.
   But buying interest faded when the August contract topped $375
an ounce. Speculators took profits, pushing prices down to near the
middle of the day's trading range.
   ``The close was a little disappointing. I don't know how much
immediate follow-through we'll get from this,'' said Anne Orton,
vice president of the currency and precious metals dealer Deak
International Inc.
   Still, Orton said, ``the gold market looks a lot more
constructive than it has for quite some.''
   Analyst John O'Connell of Refco Inc. in New York said gold's
recent strength was only ``a blip'' so far. He said he didn't have
great confidence that the rally would continue but said the chart
signals remained bullish .
   Silver futures settled 1.5 cents to 1.8 cents higher with July
at $4.828 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures rose strongly for the third time in the last four
sessions on the Commodity Exchange amid expectations that workers
at Peru's state-owned Mineroperu metals mining and refining company
will go on strike Thursday.
   Copper settled .15 cent to 1.45 cents higher with July at $1.237
a pound.
   Most energy futures retreated on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on modest profit-taking as traders awaited developments
from an OPEC meeting in Geneva.
   Ministers from the 13-member cartel are expected to negotiate
new production quotas in an effort to raise world oil prices.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. energy broker Brian Tagler said the
lack of fresh news from the oil cartel's gathering gave traders an
opportunity to sell and collect profits amassed during the oil
market's recent advance.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents lower to 4
cents higher with September at $20.38 a barrel; heating oil was .56
cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 56.76 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .24 cent to .45 cent lower with August at
63.04 cents a gallon.
   Pork belly futures soared the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit for
the second straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as the
cash market continued to strengthen.
   Hog futures also rose sharply in line with higher cash prices
for live hogs. Higher cash cattle prices boosted the cattle futures.
   Live cattle were .28 cent to .82 cent higher with August at
77.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .68 cent higher
with August at 88.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent to 1.5
cents higher with August at 60.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.95 cents to 2 cents higher with August at 47.12
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade as late profit-taking erased modest gains posted
earlier in the session.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 2{ cents lower with September at $3.01{
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent lower with September at
$2.60} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents higher with September
at $1.29 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 6 cents lower with
August at $5.83} a bushel.

   Chrysler Corp. and an Australian truck maker
announced separate plans Wednesday to bring auto production work to
an area that has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in recent
years.
   Local officials said the projects would help boost a sagging
economy.
   Chrysler announced an incentive package to move production of
the Jeep Wrangler from Brampton, Ontario, starting Jan. 1, 1993. It
also said if it decides to build the new ``JJ'' model, it would be
produced in Toledo.
   The plan may create new jobs, but how many is unclear. Chrysler
said the transfer of Wrangler to Toledo would offset the projected
decline in sales of Jeep Cherokee and Grand Wagoneers, both made in
Toledo. But the United Auto Workers union said it expected Wrangler
production to create hundreds of jobs.
   ``We're looking at retaining thousands of good-paying jobs at
Jeep plus untold thousands of other jobs held by Toledoans, which
rely on Jeep,'' Mayor John McHugh said.
   While Chrysler was making its announcement, Kelpie North America
Corp. said it would make a hydraulic-lift pickup truck in
Northwood, about five miles east of Toledo. The $225 million
venture is expected to create 1,500 production jobs and could
result in 4,500 related jobs.
   ``Given the loss of manufacturing jobs in our area, it is
especially good to see not just new jobs being added, but
manufacturing jobs as well,'' Northwood Mayor John Hageman said.
   ``These are jobs that will provide a respectable standard of
living for our families,'' Wood County Commissioner Thomas Warns
said.
   Toledo has seen its manufacturing base erode. It has lost 3,000
manufacturing jobs in the last two years alone. The unemployment
rate for the Toledo area in May was 7.0 percent.
   The latest word of a plant closing came in May, when Champion
Spark Plug Co. said it would close its Toledo plant by the end of
the year, idling 430 workers.
   Three small auto parts plants have closed since January 1989,
putting 620 people out of work. Other companies have reduced their
work force or moved operations to other cities with lower labor
costs.
   Chrysler said the Brampton plant would be closed with the move
of Wrangler production to Toledo, but some workers would be
transferred to another Chrysler plant in Canada.
   In return, Toledo and the state will provide incentives that
could total $22.3 million over the next 10 years. They include a
possible 10-year tax abatement on personal property taxes for
Chrysler, up to $500,000 a year for seven years for plant
improvements, and up to $5 million to retrain workers.
   The agreement is the final piece of a package that was needed to
move Wrangler production to Toledo and keep the two existing plants
operating beyond 1992. The two plants employ 5,300 people.
   The first pickup truck made by Kelpie North America could roll
off the Northwood assembly line by October of 1991. The company, a
subsidiary of Sydney, Australia-based Kelpie Industries Ltd.,
expects to begin construction this summer on 70 acres.
   The truck features a bed and tailgate that lower to the ground.
It will retail for $16,500 to $17,900.
   Kelpie expects to build 60,000 trucks a year for the U.S.
market. A Canadian site also had been considered.
   ``Major contributing factors were strong community support and
an excellent local, skilled labor pool,'' Paul Cooper, president of
Kelpie North America, said at a news conference in Bowling Green.
   The one-ton, front-wheel drive truck has no rear axle; the
wheels are mounted directly to the frame. The load tray, known as
the bed, would be raised and lowered hydraulically, making it easy
for people to place heavy objects in the truck.

   The exchange said the transactions in the cocoa market have been

   Digital Equipment Corp. reported a $256.7 million
fourth-quarter loss Wednesday, the computer giant's first ever
quarterly loss and a reflection of a voluntary severance program
under which 3,000 employees left over the last 12 months.
   Mark Steinkrauss, director of investor relations, said Digital's
restructuring program included plans to cut another 5,000 to 6,000
people in the coming months through voluntary severance and
attrition.
   The loss by one of New England's most important companies
provided further evidence of economic trouble in the region, which
grew quickly during the boom years of the 1980s but tumbled into
recession because of the slumping high-technology, financial
services and real estate industries.
   But some securities analysts who follow Digital saw the loss as
a piece of good news because it showed the company was aggressively
trying to cut expenses while remaining competitive.
   ``I'm encouraged that they decided to bite the bullet and do
it,'' said Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc. in
New York. ``Things are as bad as they're going to get, and now
they're going to get better.''
   Added Steinkrauss: ``The company knew exactly what it was doing.
..in light of what it needs to do in terms of reducing its cost
structure.''
   Still, the news was not well received on Wall Street. Digital
stock fell 62{ cents a share to $74.87{ in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   Employee retraining, separation incentives and other costs
associated with the Maynard, Mass.-based company's restructuring
program cost $400 million in the fourth quarter.
   Senior Vice President John F. Smith also attributed the computer
maker's loss to ``the continuing economic slowdown that affects
both U.S. and several other markets.''
   For its fourth quarter ended June 30, the company said it lost
$2.11 a share on revenue of $3.4 billion, compared with earnings of
$313.2 million, or $2.51 a share, on revenue of $3.5 billion for
the same quarter in 1989.
   Profits for the full fiscal year after absorbing pretax charges
of $550 million fell to $74.4 million or 59 cents a share, from
$1.1 billion or $8.45 a share in 1989. Digital's sales were up 2
percent to $12.9 billion, from $12.7 billion last year.
   ``Increasing profit is the most important challenge the company
faces,'' Smith said in a statement. ``We are not satisfied with our
operating results and will continue focusing on revenue growth and
reducing our cost structure.''
   He said the company was reducing costs by identifying positions
that are no longer needed, either because of changes in technology
or business practices.
   ``We expect to begin receiving ongoing cost savings from these
actions in the current year, and the full impact will be realized
by next fiscal year,'' Smith said in the statement.
   Schulman, who predicted Digital's turnaround would take about
two years, said many of the bigger computer companies are
scrambling to update product lines and keep up with overseas
competitors.
   ``Given their size, it's going to take awhile,'' he said. ``The
underlying problem is the shift in the structure of demand toward
work stations and PCs (personal computers) _ areas which do not
represent a high percentage of their revenue.''
   Companies are also beginning to scale back from the explosive
expansion of the early 1980s, when the industry boomed in
California's Silicon Valley and along Massachusetts' Route 128.
   More recently layoffs and other job reductions have been
widespread among industry giants like Digital, the world's second
largest computer maker after International Business Machines Corp.
   In December, IBM announced it would eliminate 10,000 U.S. jobs.
Other affected companies have included Unisys Corp., Control Data
Corp., Amdahl Corp., Bull HN Information Systems Inc., Wang
Laboratories Inc. and Prime Computer.
   ``The whole industry has been slumping and it looks like it's
continuing,'' said David Wu, a stock analyst with S.G. Warburg &amp;
Co. in New York. ``Digital can recover but it's a matter of how
much and how fast.''

   Sales of existing homes posted their first
increase in seven months in June, but analysts were divided
Wednesday on whether the modest 1.2 percent gain offered at least
the glimmer of rebound for the depressed housing sector.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes edged up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.34 million units.
   The June advance was the first increase in sales since a 3.2
percent gain in November. Since then, existing home sales have
either fallen or remained unchanged as the housing industry was
battered by rising mortgage rates.
   Industry officials said they viewed the June advance as an
encouraging sign that better days may be ahead, especially in light
of the fact that mortgage rates have been declining in recent
months.
   Fixed-rate mortgages fell to 9.99 percent last week, according
to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. It
marked the first time rates have been below 10 percent in six
months.
   ``People have been watching to see which way rates are headed.
Now, they're out scouting the inventory. In general, it appears the
market is building up steam,'' said Norman D. Flynn, president of
the Realtors group.
   But David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., said he
saw little reason to believe that the small June upturn in existing
home sales would be followed by further gains.
   ``We may have found the floor for the slump in housing, but I
don't think we will be coming off of it for awhile,'' Wyss said.
``People just aren't as excited about owning a home because the
investment prospects don't look as good as they did in the 1990s.''
   The median price of an existing home rose 2 percent in June, to
$97,500. The median is the midpoint, with half the homes selling
for more and half for less.
   The sales strength in June came from a sharp 9.1 percent jump in
activity in the Midwest, where existing homes were sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 960,000 units.
   Sales also were up in the West by a smaller 1.8 percent, to an
annual rate of 580,000 units.
   The other two regions of the country posted sales declines. In
the South, sales fell a slight 0.8 percent to an annual rate of
1.31 million units.
   Sales were off 5.8 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate
of 490,000 units as that section of the country continued to
exhibit extremely weak sales activity.
   Flynn said that psychological barriers caused by a general
economic slowdown were continuing to scare away buyers in the
Northeast.
   ``Unfortunately, many people in the Northeast are of the mindset
that it is a bad time to buy,'' Flynn said. ``That is bunk. Sellers
are more than willing to negotiate. Buyers should be jumping into
the market.''

   Factory orders for ``big ticket'' durable
goods plummeted 3.2 percent in June, the government said Wednesday
in a report that raised new concerns that the United States could
be flirting with a recession.
   The Commerce Department said that demand for durable goods,
items ranging from bicycles to battleships, fell $4.14 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $124.69 billion last month.
   The June decline came as a surprise to analysts who had counted
on a further pickup in orders to signal that the fortunes of the
nation's manufacturing sector were on a permanent upswing.
   Durable goods orders are considered a key barometer for the
future since a drop in orders normally triggers cutbacks in
production plans and job layoffs.
   Hopes for a rebound in manufacturing had been fueled by a 4.2
percent rise in orders in May and an even bigger 6.7 percent
advance in March.
   But the June decline continues the saw-tooth pattern evident
since January. Orders fell by 4.1 percent in April and dropped by a
record of 10.5 percent in January.
   ``The durable goods report is a distinct yellow flag on how the
economy might perform in the second half of the year,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``In two of the last three
months, we have seen substantial declines in the orders numbers.''
   Mark Zandi, senior economist at Regional Financial Associates in
Chester, Pa., said the orders report was especially disappointing
because many economists had looked for a rebound in manufacturing
to help bolster growth in coming months.
   ``If manufacturing doesn't show signs of strength, there really
is no sector of the economy to provide the impetus for growth,'' he
said. ``The consumer sector is extremely weak, investment spending
has been hurt by the slide in profits and housing is in a
recession.''
   The news came on a day when a new poll by ABC and Money magazine
said a record proportion of respondents, 71 percent, believed it
was not a good time to make a purchase, and the same proportion
believed the economy was in not-so-good or poor shape. The poll did
not give comparisons from the past.
   A separate report Wednesday showed that sales of existing
single-family homes posted a small 1.2 percent advance in June, the
first monthly gain since last November.
   The National Association of Realtors attributed the upturn to
falling mortgage rates and said it offered the promise of further
gains in the months ahead. But other economists said that a
one-month upturn did not signal an end to the extended slump
besetting the housing industry.
   In a sign of how sluggish the manufacturing sector has been,
orders for durable goods totaled $744.7 billion during the first
six months of this year, 1.5 percent below the same period in 1989.
   The June weakness was widespread across all industry groups.
About half of the decline was attributed to a 20.7 percent drop in
orders for military hardware, the biggest setback in the defense
category since a 33.6 percent drop in January.
   The military sector tends to be extremely volatile, depending on
the timing of government contracts. But analysts believe this
year's weakness reflects the beginnings of an extended period of
defense cutbacks.
   Even without the big defense decrease, durable goods orders
would have been down 1.7 percent in June.

<HEAD>Dominant Diamond Business De Beers In Deal For Soviet Output</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers tightened its grip on the global diamond
market Wednesday with an exclusive five-year deal to sell the
Soviet Union's rough diamond output, which could total more than $5
billion.
   The financially strained Soviet Union, among the world's biggest
gem diamond producers, will get a $1 billion advance against future
diamond sales.
   De Beers' London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling
Organization, will strengthen its position as the world's dominant
diamond seller. It already markets 80 percent of global rough
diamond production of some 100 million carats.
   The Soviets do not disclose their output.
   The nation reached the deal because it wanted to sell a huge
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the stable world diamond
market, De Beers said.
   The Soviet Union had refused to deal directly with the South
African-based company because of its home country's policies of
racial separation, but now is willing to do business openly with De
Beers' new Swiss arm, De Beers Centenary AG.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. established the publicly-held
Swiss company in May to head the non-South African businesses of De
Beers, which is controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   De Beers Centenary said in a statement released in Lucerne,
Switzerland and made available in London that it reached the
agreement with Glavalmazzoloto of the Soviet Union for the
exclusive export and sale of the USSR diamond production.
   Glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals
and diamonds under the Soviet Union's council of ministers, De
Beers said.
   De Beers' Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Centenary Holdings SA,
has agreed to advance Glavalmazzoloto $1 billion against future
diamond deliveries. Repayment would be made over five years
beginning in November.
   The Soviet diamond stockpile will be held at De Beers'
London-based marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, as
collateral for the advance, De Beers said.
   The organization, a 57-year-old cartel, has the financial
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds, which is how it keeps
the market stable.
   Although De Beers said it had had no direct contact with the
Soviet Union since 1963, diamond experts say De Beers already sells
most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds.
   ``We have not had an official agreement with the Russians. In
the past, obviously, being major distributors of rough (diamonds),
Russian diamonds have found their way into the rough,'' said De
Beers spokesman Roger Van Eeghen. ``It came through other sources,
other channels.''
   All the world's major diamond producers, including Botswana,
Australia, Tanzania, Zaire and Namibia, have sales contracts with
De Beers Centenary. The Central Selling Organization had sales of
$4.09 billion last year.
   De Beers must renegotiate several key contracts this year, which
experts have said might loosen its grip on the diamond market.
   The formal marketing of the Soviet diamonds, like those from
elsewhere, will take place in London and Lucerne, De Beers said.
   Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers chairman, said the deal would
bring ``continued stability and prosperity of the international
diamond industry.''
   Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary,
said the Soviet Union, at a time of ``considerable financial
strain,'' was able to raise a $1 billion loan while signing a
contract assuring it of ``a steady flow of funds from diamonds''
over the next five years.
   Large-scale diamond mining began in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and is concentrated in the Yakutia region of North Eastern
Siberia, De Beers said.

   The court ruling that cleared the way for Time
Inc. to buy Warner Communications Inc. is a year old, but Wall
Street has doubts about the media and entertainment conglomerate's
prospects.
   Worries about the company's big debt, its ability to handle
possible interest rate hikes and absorb shocks in businesses such
as moviemaking or records have depressed its stock price. So have
uncertainties about possible changes in the regulatory environment
for its cable television business.
   The acquisition costs have led to scary financial reports as
well. Time Warner lost $376 million in the first half of the year
after paying preferred dividends.
   ``How the mighty have fallen,'' said media analyst Dennis
McAlpine of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in a recent analysis.
   The company that won Wall Street raves as ``the forerunner of
the international media behemoth'' a few months ago, he wrote, is
now viewed there ``with the disdain normally accorded a skunk
walking into a church social.''
   But he recommended buying the depressed stock, citing the
company's ``eminent position in most of the industries in which it
operates, its apparent ability to meet its debt obligations and its
positive long-term prospects.''
   Time Warner stock traded in the mid-$90s this past week, down
from a peak of $182.75 a share last summer. The stock had soared in
June 1989 after Paramount Communications Inc. offered $200 a share
for Time, only days before shareholder votes were scheduled on
Time's plan to merge with Warner.
   Time executives called Paramount's offer phony, reworked the
Warner deal in a way that required no shareholder vote and got the
Delaware Supreme Court's blessing in a ruling July 24, 1989.
   As a result, Paramount never got the chance to take its offer
directly to Time's stockholders. Many still resent that.
   ``We would have preferred that they would have accepted
Paramount's offer,'' said Kyle Krueger, portfolio manager for Eagle
Asset Management in St. Petersburg, Fla., which now owns 1.63
percent of Time Warner's stock.
   But he doesn't blame Time Warner management for the company's
current low price. ``We think they are doing fairly well,'' he said.
   Time Warner executives say the company's stock price reflects
the market's distaste for companies with debt, and its disfavor for
those in the cable and entertainment industries in particular.
   They argue Time Warner can handle its debt. Time Warner's
magazine, music, film, book, TV production and cable television
businesses are generating more than enough cash to meet debt
payments over the next few years, they say.
   Securities analysts generally agree that the company will
generate $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion in cash flow a year, while
interest and preferred stock payments will require about $1.3
billion a year through 1992.
   But in 1993, the company is due to reduce its debt by $2
billion. McAlpine and others feel the company will have to either
sell assets or take on partners in joint ventures to raise money by
that date.
   McAlpine also said the company has $3 billion in investments
that could be sold to reduce debt. These include shares of
companies such as Hasbro, Atari and Turner Broadcasting Systems
Inc., real estate in Burbank, Calif., and minority interests in
assorted cable system operators.
   Time Warner's co-chief executives, Steven J. Ross and Nicholas
J. Nicholas Jr., told analysts in May that they are looking for
partners who can give the company access to new makets or who will
pay handsomely for a minority stake in various Time Warner
operations.
   In the meantime, Ross and Nicholas appear determined to run the
company as if there were no $10.8 billion debt.
   Peter Appert, media analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., wrote after the May meeting that while the company was aware
of Wall Street's concerns with its high debt level, ``management's
focus appears to be on expanding the business first and lowering
the debt levels second.''
   Time Warner has made a number of strategic deals over the past
few months.
   It bought Lane Publishing, a California magazine publisher, for
about $180 million in cash and stock. Senior magazine executives
hope to use Lane as a springboard for regional publishing ventures
in the West and Far East.
   In April, the company paid $19.5 million for a 19.5 percent
stake in Six Flags Corp., which runs seven amusement parks and may
offer a wider outlet for the Warner Bros. cast of cartoon
characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.
   Time Warner spent $13.3 million in March for a 25 percent stake
in a cellular radio venture with Price Communications. It offers an
opportunity to get a close look at a new line of business.
   It entered a joint venture for a Scandinavian pay TV service,
and is helping build the first modern movie theaters in the Soviet
Union. Both markets offer appealing growth potential.
   Its most controversial move to date was a tentative agreement to
guarantee $650 million in loans for Pathe Communications Inc.'s
$1.2 billion bid for MGM-UA Communications Inc.
   The deal alarmed some analysts who felt Time Warner could not
afford the extra debt. But Time Warner executives said the risk was
well worth it because its loan guarantee would have been secured by
the United Artists film library that they said was worth much more
than $650 million.
   The issue has evidently become moot as the pact between Pathe
and Time fell apart amid an exchange of lawsuits before any loans
were arranged.
   ``From an outsider's perspective, maybe it was better that they
didn't get involved,'' said Edward Atorino, media analyst for
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Time Warner also is investing millions in its core businesses.
It launched a magazine, Entertainment Weekly, which some analysts
say could lose $60 million before turning profitable, and a cable
network, The Comedy Channel.
   The company also has cut back since Time obtained control of
Warner last July. It sold the textbook company Scott, Foresman and
Co. for $448 million last December. Its Southern Progress Corp.
suspended publication of money-losing Southpoint magazine, a
regional magazine, in May.
   Nonetheless, the company says the diversity of its businesses,
which run from Time and Fortune magazines and Book-of-the-Month
Club to music from Pasula Abdul and movies like ``Batman'' and
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' insulate it against reversals in any one
business.
   Gordon Crawford, senior vice president at the research arm of
Capital Group Inc., the single largest Time Warner stockholder with
an 8 percent stake, said company management is doing fine and the
market will eventually realize it.
   ``Their actions illustrate they are going to continue running
the company in an aggressive fashion with a longterm point of
view,'' he said.

   When the multibillion-dollar fight for Time Inc.
landed in the Delaware courts last year, everyone who followed the
case knew there was more at stake than just the outcome of a
takeover battle.
   They were right. The legal precedent that emerged strengthened
the takeover defenses of some of the nation's biggest firms and
became a model for laws in other states.
   When the Ohio Legislature passed a new anti-takeover bill in
April, lawmakers included a provision that has become known as the
Time Warner Amendment: ``The selection of a time frame for the
achievement of corporate goals shall be the responsibility of the
directors.''
   The provision codifies the Delaware Supreme Court's ruling that
boards of directors are not under a duty to put aside their
long-term goals in favor of a takeover bid that would give
stockholders more money for their shares now.
   Leigh Trevor, a member of the Ohio State Bar Association who
lobbied for the amendment's passage, said he and other corporate
lawyers wanted ``to remove debate over that subject in court''
should an Ohio company find itself in a situation similar to Time's.
   In March 1989, Time and Warner Communications Inc. announced
plans to merge in a stock swap valued at $18 billion. Then, in
June, three weeks before shareholders were to vote on the deal,
Paramount Communications Inc. launched a hostile $10.7 billion bid
for Time alone.
   Time responded by beginning its own $14 billion tender offer for
Warner, Paramount raised its bid to $12.2 billion and the companies
went to court in Delaware, where all three were incorporated.
   Paramount argued that the Time board should be forced to
seriously consider its bid, which would give shareholders immediate
cash instead of the future profits promised by Time and Warner.
   Meanwhile, the would-be merger partners contended that their
plans _ which culminated two years of negotiations _ should not
have to be shunted aside just because a third party had put a
higher offer on the table.
   In July, Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen and then
the state Supreme Court upheld the right of the Time board to
proceed with the combination with Warner and the creation of Time
Warner Inc.
   In a written decision issued in February, Supreme Court Justice
Henry R. Horsey said, ``A board of directors ... is not under any
per se duty to maximize shareholder value in the short-term even in
the context of a takeover.''
   Legal scholars viewed the ruling as strengthening the hand of
directors in takeover battles.
   The decision automatically added protection to other companies
incorporated in Delaware, home to many of the country's biggest
firms, including about half the Fortune 500. Other states look to
Delaware for guidance on corporate law issues, so Ohio included the
Delaware ruling in its statutes.
   ``We wanted to make it crystal clear if it is not already clear
enough ... the time frame for achieving corporate objectives is a
board decision,'' said Trevor, a partner with the law firm Jones,
Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue in Cleveland.
   Critics of anti-takeover statutes tend to view laws such as the
new Ohio provision as a means for entrenching management.
   But its supporters say this was no knee-jerk reaction to the
Delaware ruling.
   ``If we cannot have the opportunity for long-term planning in
publicly held American companies, we put ourselves at a
disadvantage with foreign competitors whose legal systems do
provide adequate time for long-term planning and implementation of
long-term plans,'' Trevor said.
   ``We have been handing to our international competitors an
advantage because they can look out at the horizon and over the
hill and we can't,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Two of General Motors Corp.'s three primary
subsidiaries reported higher second-quarter earnings this year over
last year, while its main defense contractor had sharply lower
profits, the companies said Wednesday.
   GM reports earnings for its automotive operations Thursday.
   GM-Hughes Electronics Corp., the automaker's electronics and
defense industry company, said its earnings for the second
three-month period of this year dropped to $189.5 million or 47
cents a share, 21.1 percent below profits of $240.3 million or 60
cents a share in the same period last year.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp. and Electronic Data Systems
Corp. reported second-quarter profits rose 12.2 percent and 19.5
percent, respectively.
   GM-Hughes said its revenues during the period rose to $3 billion
from $2.8 billion during the same period a year ago.
   The company said the profit decrease was caused mainly by tax
credits recorded in the second quarter of last year and by costs
associated with new spacecraft products.
   During the quarter, GM-Hughes said it won new Defense Department
contracts that include a $210 million order for two Navy
communications satellites and a $155 million order from the
Brazilian government for a telecommunications system.
   For the first six months of the year, when U.S. government
orders decreased, GM-Hughes said it earned $372.3 million or 93
cents a share, compared with $450.4 million or $1.11 a share, a
decline of 17.3 percent.
   The news was different at GM's financing and computer systems
subsidiaries.
   GMAC said it earned $301.6 million during the second quarter,
compared with $268.8 million during the same quarter a year ago.
Lower short-term borrowing costs helped boost income from financing
operations to $267 million during the quarter from $224 million in
the year-ago period.
   For the first half of 1990, GMAC's profits rose slightly to $638
million compared with $625 million during the first six months of
last year.
   EDS earnings continued their upward trend during the second
quarter by increasing to $125.3 million or 52 cents a share,
compared with $104.9 or 44 cents a share during the second quarter
of last year.
   Revenues rose to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion last year.
   During the quarter, EDS signed contracts with Westmoreland Coal
Co. of Philadelphia and Westar Transmission Co., a subsidiary of
American Oil and Gas Corp.
   In the first half of the year, EDS earned $235.1 million, or 98
cents a share, compared with $204.9 million, or 85 cents a share,
during the first six months of 1989.
   Revenues for the January-June period this year were $2.8 billion
compared with $2.6 billion during the same period last year.

<HEAD>Bethlehem, Allegheny Ludlum Profits Decline in 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. on Wednesday reported a 74 percent slump
in second-quarter earnings while Allegheny Ludlum Corp. posted a 38
percent plunge in its quarterly income. Both steelmakers blamed
lower steel prices for part of the deterioration.
   Bethlehem Steel said it earned $21.9 million, or 21 cents a
share, in the three months ended June 30, down from $84.1 million,
or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped about 10 percent to
$1.28 billion from $1.43 billion during the second quarter of 1989.
   Allegheny Ludlum, the nation's largest specialty steel maker,
said for the three months ended July 1 profits were $22.6 million,
or 68 cents a share, down from $36.7 million, or $1.08 per share,
in the same period of 1989. Sales fell 11 percent to $295.99
million from $333.81 million a year earlier.

   Lower steel prices and shipments and higher operating costs at
Bethlehem Steel's Sparrows Point plant near Baltimore caused the
decline, chairman Walter F. Williams said in a news release.
   Steel shipments were reported down about 13 percent, primarily
in semifinished steel shipments to other steel producers. The
company said shipments are not expected to slip further during the
third quarter because of recent strong orders from the automotive
market and declining steel imports.
   Costs rose at Sparrows Point because of planned outages of the
large blast furnace and the hot strip mill for maintenance and
modernization, the company said. A scheduled 25-day outage at the
hot strip mill during August and continued coke oven repairs at
Sparrows Point will dampen third-quarter results, but ultimately
enhance overall performance, Williams said.
   For the first six months, Bethlehem Steel netted $43.2 million,
or 41 cents a share, on sales of $2.49 billion. In the first half
of 1989, Bethlehem Steel reported income of $148.8 million, or
$1.81 a share, on sales of $2.84 billion.
   During the second quarter of 1989, results included $50 million
of unusual charges for restructuring the company's BethForge
Division. Net income also was reduced in the first half of 1989 by
$55 million of restructuring charges related to the Baltimore
Marine Division.
   Operating results at both divisions improved during the second
quarter this year, the company said.
   The company warned against approval of legislation pending in
Congress that would stiffen controls under the Clean Air Act.
   ``We believe that certain features of the bill concerning air
toxics are not based on sound scientific data and available
technology and, if enacted, could impose significant, unwarranted
costs on domestic steelmakers in the future,'' Williams said.

<HEAD>Allegheny Ludlum</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny Ludlum said its profit drop reflected lower prices,
which were pushed down by competition and increased exports of
semi-finished electrical steel.
   In the first half of 1990, profits fell 35 percent to $45.9
million, or $1.37 per share, compared with $71 million, or $2.10
per share, in the same period of 1989. Sales fell nearly 18 percent
in the first half to $575.4 million from $697.7 million, the
company said.
   ``While the future overall direction of the economy is unclear,
so far, market demand for our specialty materials this year has
surpassed our expectations and new market applications continue to
be developed,'' President Robert P. Bozzone said.
   He said the cost of a new four-year labor agreement, effective
April 1, also contributed to the decline in second-quarter earnings.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices finished slightly higher on London's
Stock Exchange Wednesday, with investors worried about British
corporate earnings and a drop in the pound.
   The day began on a positive note, with prices charging to
session peaks. But the advance couldn't be sustained, dealers said,
because of worries about corporate profits.
   Investors also were agitated by a sharp drop in sterling which
was pressured by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's failure
Tuesday, during an economic debate in the House of Commons, to
mention plans for the pound's entry into Europe's exchange rate
mechanism.
   Instead, the chancellor commented that inflation could go yet
higher.
   ``The market is realizing that (entry) will take longer than
anticipated,'' one market maker said. ``Some of the euphoria is
evaporating.''
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 3.8 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,364.7, above the session
low of 2,363.1 but off the day's high of 2,382.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was off 1.0 point at 1,865.7.
The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.14 points to close at
1,275.36.
   Volume came to 427.5 million shares compared with 385.7 million
shares Tuesday.

<HEAD>High Court Throws Out Some Claims, Allows Others Against Cigarette
Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' highest court threw out parts of a
lawsuit Wednesday against a tobacco company whose cigarettes were
bought by minors, but allowed some claims to continue.
   The Supreme Judicial Court granted summary judgment in favor of
Philip Morris Cos. Inc., dismissing claims that the company should
be held liable for the fact that convenience stores sold cigarettes
to the two plaintiffs, Theresa Kyte and Sean Cann.
   But the court said the plaintiffs could pursue their claims that
the company engaged in a deceptive act in violation of state
consumer protection laws. The court also declined to dismiss a
claim that the company breached an implied warranty that its
products were safe.
   A Middlesex County Superior Court judge had denied the company's
motions for summary judgment.
   ``You only need one (claim) to win,'' said Edward Greer, an
attorney representing the plaintiffs.
   But Hadrian Katz, an attorney for Philip Morris, said the
court's decision effectively wiped out the plaintiffs' case.
``There's nothing left,'' he said.
   Tobacco liability cases have been brought against cigarette
companies in the past, but rarely have met success.
   In 1988, a federal jury in New Jersey awarded the first damages
against a cigarette company, giving $400,000 to a man whose wife
died of lung cancer. But an appeals court overturned the award this
year and ordered a new trial.
   In Boston this year, a federal jury found American Tobacco Co.
should not be held liable for the cancer death of a Cambridge man.
   Greer said unlike the previous cases, his case focuses on minors
who do not have the same ability as adults to gather information
and make decisions.
   Kyte, of Waltham, started smoking at age 12, and Cann, of
Brookline, at age 15. Each smoked Marlboro and Parliament
cigarettes, made by Philip Morris.
   They claim they repeatedly bought the cigarettes at convenience
stores, even though state law prohibits selling tobacco to minors.
   In their suit, they said the company conspired to sell the
cigarettes to minors through the convenience stores.
   But the high court rejected the argument.
   ``We have accepted the principle that, in particular
circumstances, a supplier may be liable for harm caused after the
supplier knowingly placed property in the hands of an incompetent
person,'' the court said.
   ``Our cases have not, however, held a manufacturer of a product
liable in negligence simply because some third party unlawfully
placed that product in the hands of a minor and, as a result, the
minor or some other person was harmed,'' the decision said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Paul Liacos said the
plaintiffs raised legitimate issues and should have been allowed to
present more evidence to support their claims.
   The court allowed two other claims to proceed. One is that
Philip Morris violated state consumer protection laws through a
``pattern and practice of sales to minors,'' Greer said. He said he
would show that Philip Morris profits from sales to minors and
targets its advertising toward young consumers.
   The second claim accuses the company of breaching an implied
warranty that its products are ``fit for intended use, free from
defect, safe to consume and non-carcinogenic and non-addictive.''
   To make this case, the plaintiffs claim a design defect
specifically with Marlboro and Parliament cigarettes, rather than
claiming all cigarettes are inherently defective.
   Philip Morris' Katz said the claims of unique design defects
were ``nonsense.''

   British Aerospace PLC said Wednesday it would
appeal a European Commission decision ordering the British company
to repay illegal government subsidies it received when it bought
the formerly state-owned Rover car maker.
   British Aerospace said it would appeal to the European Court of
Justice the order to repay 44.4 million pounds, or about $80
million, of hidden sweeteners.
   The company said that following ``a careful review'' and in
light of independent professional advice, it would file an appeal
to protect shareholders' interests and test its rights before the
court.
   The company said it has informed the government and shareholders
of its decision.
   The government has said it accepted the EC's June decision but
was disputing the amount of sweeteners to be returned.
   British Aerospace bought Rover from the government for 150
million pounds, or $272 million, in July 1988.

   Airbus Industrie will pay Rohr
Industries Inc. $1 billion to supply another 800 jetliners with
engine nacelle systems, the aerodynamic structures that surround
jet engines, Rohr said Wednesday.
   Rohr made a deal in 1984 with the European plane-building

   Under Wednesday's follow-on agreement it will also supply
nacelle systems for 800 A321 planes beginning in early 1992. The
A321 is a stretch version of the A320, and Rohr said the systems
will have many similarities.
   It was the second $1 billion agreement announced this year by
Rohr, an aerospace component supplier based in Chula Vista, near
San Diego. Rohr said in March it had been awarded a $1 billion
contract to provide the engine nacelle system for McDonnell
Douglas' MD-90 airliner.

   A meeting of senior trade negotiators is expected
to end Thursday with agreement on the need for intense efforts to
overcome barriers in crucial talks aimed at a more open global
economy.
   But the outcome of the four-day meeting leaves rifts between the
United States and the European Community, and between
industrialized countries and the Third World.
   David Woods, spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, said Wednesday that the meeting would likely endorse a
package of proposals aimed at liberalizing trade in 15 key areas.
   However, he said a number of high-level officials attending the
105-nation Trade Negotiations Committee meeting had voiced
disappointment that more progress had not been made on narrowing
differences.
   The proposals are described as ``profile'' accords. Full
agreements are meant to be finalized at the start of December when
the Uruguay Round of trade talks concludes.
   The aim of the negotiations, launched in 1986, is to reduce
barriers to trade and set new standards in important areas such as
banking services. Many countries have warned that failure of the
talks will lead to a dangerous surge of protectionism.
   But the ``profiles'' demonstrate how much work remains, little
more than four months before the deadline.
   The proposal on liberalizing trade in textiles, for example,
includes conflicting policy options backed by the United States,
the EC and Third World textile exporters.
   The text on intellectual property rights such as patents also
reflects the same three-way split.
   A compromise document on agriculture lays out clear proposals
for cutting domestic farm supports and import barriers, and says
export subsidies should be reduced most of all.
   But the United States and agricultural exporters like Australia
still insist on the elimination of export subsidies, while the EC
has made it plain it will defend their use.
   Woods said the meeting had met the end-of-July target for
profile accords, even though some countries ``may not agree that
what we have achieved are satisfactory final profiles.''
   He said the final session Thursday was expected to agree on a
way to intensify the negotiations. The meeting, comprised mainly of
officials just below ministerial rank, was originally scheduled to
last until Friday.
   It had been widely billed as a chance to boost progress in the
most contentious areas.
   Chief EC negotiator Hugo Paemen told a press conference that
senior officials were likely to travel to Geneva for another
meeting Oct. 8 and then be on ``permanent standby'' until the
December ministerial gathering in Brussels.
   He described the package of proposals as a ``strong basis to
start from.''
   Paemen's optimism contrasted with formal statements from
developing countries. Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and China were among
those criticizing lack of headway in efforts to reduce import
duties and open markets.
   The United States, Australia and Canada all voiced concern in
speeches Tuesday.

   U.S. rice farmers can expect competition for
world markets to heat up in the coming year, an Agriculture
Department report said Wednesday.
   Vietnam, the report said, has cut into Thailand's markets by
selling at ``prices substantially below'' those offered by Thai
exporters. Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter.
   ``Recently, Thailand announced an export subsidy scheme in an
effort to increase exports, but the response has been weak,'' the
report said.
   Thailand's market share dropped from 40 percent in 1989 to 31
forecast for 1990.
   ``It is expected that Thailand will aggressively compete with
Vietnam to regain market share in 1991,'' the report said.
   The U.S. global market share is forecast to fall to about 18
percent in 1991 from 20 percent the past two years. Analysts said
tight supplies and relatively high prices ``may hinder U.S.
competitiveness'' in some foreign markets.

   Eric Gleacher, who left Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to
form his own mergers and acquisitions firm, is combining his
business with that of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the London-based
merchant banking company, it was announced Wednesday.
   The new firm, Gleacher Morgan Grenfell Inc. will handle U.S.
mergers and acquisitions and what are called cross-border
transactions, those involving U.S. and foreign parties.
   Gleacher Morgan Grenfell will operate as the U.S. arm of Morgan
Grenfell, which is a subsidiary of the Deutsche Bank Group.
   Gleacher said his firm will be a partner to Morgan Grenfell but
independent of the merchant banker.
   ``It's not like me going back to work for Morgan Stanley,'' he
said.
   After opening his own firm earlier this year, Gleacher advised
ConAgra Inc. on its $3.8 billion purchase of Beatrice Co. and
expected to expand his business overseas to take advantage of the
growing number of cross-border transactions.
   He said in a telephone interview Wednesday that it had become
``clear to me that we could never accomplish on our own what we
could accomplish as partners with Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche
Bank.''
   While at Morgan Stanley, which is not connected with Morgan
Grenfell, Gleacher advised Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. on its
$24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported record profits and
sales for the second quarter and the first half of the year
Wednesday as new brands pumped up growth for the world's largest
brewer.
   In the three months ended June 30, profits were $257.5 million,
or 90 cents a share, up 10.2 percent from $233.7 million, or 82
cents a share, in the corresponding 1989 quarter.
   Sales of $3 billion were 11.5 percent higher than the $2.69
billion in last year's second quarter.
   Two beers introduced this year _ Bud Dry and Busch Light _ led
the way for the big increases in the quarter, along with the strong
performance of the company's four other light beers.
   ``We are extremely pleased with our beer company's
performance,'' said Auust A. Busch III, chairman and president of
the company.
   The company sold 22.3 million barrels of beer to wholesalers in
the quarter, compared with 21.4 million in the same period a year
ago. Beer sales in the first half were 42.4 million, up from 41
million in the same period a year earlier.
   Busch has said that he wants the company to achieve a 50 percent
market share over the next few years and one way to do that is to
introduce new products.
   Since January, the company has rolled out Bud Dry and Busch
Light nationally along with a non-alcoholic beer called O'Douls.
The company is also testing another new beer, Busch Draft.
   The company also was helped by higher profits in several other
subsidiaries including Campbell Taggart, Inc., a wholesale bakery
and food products company, and the Metal Container Corp., which
make aluminum cans.
   For the first six months of the year, Anheuser-Busch had profits
of $440 million, or $1.54 a share, a 9.8 percent increase over the
$400.8 million, or $1.40 a share, in the first half of 1989.
   Sales of $5.59 billion were up 9.9 percent from $5.09 percent in
the first two quarters of 1989.

   Energy prices pulled back Wednesday amid some
modest profit-taking as traders awaited developments at an OPEC
meeting.
   Crude prices opened firmly on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in anticipation of what might be accomplished at the meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   Ministers from the 13-member cartel are expected to negotiate
new production quotas in an effort to raise world oil prices.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. energy broker Brian Tagler said the
lack of fresh news from the oil cartel's gathering gave traders an
opportunity to sell and collect profits amassed during the oil
market's recent advance.
   He said after a preliminary session adjourned Wednesday without
any major announcements, crude prices weakened.
   The contract for September delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 18 cents to $20.38 a
42-gallon barrel after rising 6 cents on Tuesday. The contract had
spurted 44 cents on Monday to the highest level for a near-month
contract since April.
   Contracts for delivery during October through December also
declined.
   Prices for refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc followed crude prices down.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for August delivery, which edged 0.07
cent lower on Tuesday, lost 0.24 cent on Wednesday and settled at
63.04 a gallon. Later contract months gained.
   The August contract for home heating oil, which advanced 0.82
cent on Tuesday, tumbled 0.56 cent to settle at 56.76 cents a
gallon. Subsequent contracts posted similar losses.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract settled at $1.440
per 1,000 cubic feet compared with $1.450 Wednesday. Contracts for
later delivery were mixed.
