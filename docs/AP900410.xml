   In helicopters and on foot, Sandinista
forces are pursuing Contra rebels turned cattle rustlers, state
radio said. Several clashes were reported.
   Radio Catarran in Juigalpa, capital of south-central Chontales
province, said the army aims to recover more than 700 cattle some
of the U.S.-backed guerrillas allegedly stole from farm
cooperatives and state enterprises.
   ``Air force helicopters have taken part in the pursuit,'' the
radio said Tuesday, denying the Soviet-made helicopters fired on
civilian targets.
   Capt. Francisco Enrique Lorente, chief of the army's 52nd
Brigade based in Santo Tomas, said operations are taking place in
Muhan, La Gateada and Quimichapa, the radio reported.
   It quoted Lorente as saying Contra commanders Cafe Negro (Black
Coffee), Alacran (Scorpion), and Muneco (Doll) led cattle-rustling
raids that began Friday.
   No casualties were reported on either side, and the radio said
some cattle were recovered.

   Gov. Cecil Andrus on Tuesday signed into law
a compromise bill making Idaho the nation's 47th state with an
official holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   The law establishes Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights
day on the third Monday in January, corresponding with the federal
holiday first observed in 1986.
   Idaho's action leaves Arizona, Montana and New Hampshire the
only holdouts not recognizing the federal holiday for King, who was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, at the age of 39.
   ``This historic legislation firmly demonstrates that Idahoans
have that broader concern for all humanity,'' Andrus said at a
Statehouse ceremony. ``We stand against racism and for
brotherhood.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, issued a statement from
Atlanta commending Andrus and the Idaho Legislature.
   ``Governor Andrus has provided courageous leadeship in securing
enactment of the holiday bill, as well as some of the strongest
anti-bias legislation in the nation,'' Mrs. King said.
   Idaho's 10th state holiday was approved by the Legislature last
month after lengthy, sometimes bitter debate.
   Opponents focused on the cost of another paid day off for state
employees, which some put as high as $2.6 million, and whether King
should be singled out for the honor.
   Supporters cited the impact of King's nonviolent philosophy and
his symbolic importance. They also said the action was needed to
help eliminate Idaho's stigma as a haven for racists such as the
Panhandle-based Aryan Nations. Critics dismissed that problem as
exaggerated and the fault of irresponsible media coverage.
   It took the addition of ``Idaho Human Rights Day'' to win over
enough lawmakers for passage of the bill in the session's closing
hours.
   Idaho's black population is estimated at 3,200, or just over
three-tenths of 1 percent of the state's approximately 1 million
people.
   New Hampshire legislators have consistently voted down holiday
proposals since 1979. After losing in 1989, supporters said they
would try again in 1991, the next time legislative rules allow it.
   Lawmakers in Montana, with an even smaller black population than
Idaho, made Jan. 15 a ``day of observance'' in 1987 and created
Heritage Day, a floating holiday to be designated by the governor.
   The Legislature in Arizona, the most populous state without an
official King holiday, approved a paid holiday for state employees
last year. But opponents petitioned to prevent the law from taking
effect unless it is approved in a November referendum.
   Besides states without a King Day, North Dakota's holiday is
unpaid, Louisiana's is by proclamation rather than legislation and
is Jan. 19, Maryland's is on Jan. 15 whether or not that is a
weekday, and some states give employees other holiday options to
substitute.
   The legislative victory for Idaho supporters of a King holiday
was overshadowed somewhat by its timing. While the bill was being
adopted, Idaho also was embroiled in a national controversy over
legislation that would have created the nation's most restrictive
anti-abortion law.
   Andrus vetoed that measure only minutes after the Legislature
adjourned for the year March 30, then waited more than a week to
make the King holiday bill law to ensure it would have center stage
to itself.

<TEXT>
   Charles ``Chick'' Trainor has what he thinks
is the ideal job for an Alaskan in the age of glasnost.
   Since February, when he became the nation's northernmost
Immigration and Naturalization Service officer, Trainor has enjoyed
what he sees as his dual role of federal agent and one-man welcome
wagon for Soviets coming to Alaska.
   ``My intention out there at the airport is to let them know
we're happy to have them here. None of this `Let me see your
papers,''' Trainor said.
   With cultural, educational and scientific exchanges between
Alaska and the Soviet Far East burgeoning in the last year, Nome
has become a principal contact point for citizens of both countries.
   Whenever a plane load of Soviet Young Pioneers (roughly
equivalent to Boy Scouts), artists, educators or others visit Nome,
it's Trainor's job to examine their papers and stamp their
passports. He also occasionally goes to nearby Wales on the western
tip of Seward Peninsula, or to Barrow, about 550 miles to the north
on the Arctic Ocean,
   Although Trainor works for the INS, his duties also include
those of a customs inspector. He must watch for the illegal
importation of whale ivory, animal furs, and Soviet reindeer or any
other meat products possibly carrying diseases.
   The 45-year-old former Marine has a background different from
that of most federal agents.
   Since coming to Alaska in 1966, he has owned a saloon, scratched
for gold, driven a truck, run a local housing agency and worked on
the trans-Alaska pipeline. He also has been a guard at a local
mental hospital.
   Flights between Nome and the Soviet Far East are strictly
charter, so Trainor drives over to the Nome Airport only when
summoned. Most of the calls come from Jim Rowe, whose Bering Air
Service has pioneered flights between northwest Alaska and the
Soviet Far East.
   Soviets who visit Nome, a community of 3,600 with boom-town
roots dating to turn-of-the-century gold-rush days, arrive
wide-eyed and often gawk at the stacks of consumer goods in local
stores, Trainor said.
   ``They think we stock the shelves just to impress them,'' he
said. Many return home carrying computers, stereos and other items
hard to find in the Soviet Union _ especially in the Far East. Some
stores in Nome accept rubles as a goodwill gesture, although the
Soviet currency is virtually worthless on the world market.
   Trainor thinks U.S.-Soviet exchanges will help break down
barriers to international understanding.
   ``I see no reason why we should be fighting them,'' he said.
``We don't even know them.''
   One barrier between Trainor and visiting Soviets is created,
however, by the INS uniform he wears.
   ``They are extremely suspicious of me because I'm a police
official, and I guess over there they don't hobnob with police
officials,'' said Trainor, who's studying Russian to help break
down the barriers.
   Whatever happens with superpower relations between Moscow and
Washington, Trainor and others in this coastal community think
people-to-people contact between Nome and the Soviet Far East will
have some lasting effects.
   ``They've had a taste of it now,'' Trainor said. ``They like
this town.''

   A small plane plunged nose-first into a
freshly plowed field during heavy rain Tuesday, sinking so deep in
mud and water that neither the wreckage nor its occupants could be
found, authorities said.
   ``It hit and didn't bounce, jump or anything,'' Dr. Wesley Dyer,
the Rapides Parish coroner, said after walking from the muddy field
where the wreckage was found. ``I think a thunderhead twisted it up
and spit out the pieces.''
   The crash happened sometime Tuesday afternoon and the plane
could seat four people, but authorities still hadn't found any
bodies by Tuesday night because the plane was so deeply submerged
in the water-filled hole.
   Small pieces of the plane were visible over about a 100-yard
area in the field, located between U.S. 71 and a rural road just
northwest of this small, central Louisiana community.
   Firemen, city police and parish sheriff's deputies were still
trying Tuesday night to drain the hole containing the plane so the
wreckage could be pulled out.
   Authorities said it probably would be morning before they would
learn whether anyone had been killed.
   Dyer said a small piece of wing with a serial number on it was
found in the field and the number was given to the Federal Aviation
Administration for tracing.

<HEAD>Jordan's King Pledges No Retreat From Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pledging ``there will be no turning back''
from parliamentary democracy, King Hussein is entrusting a
committee with drafting guidelines for legalizing political parties
outlawed 33 years ago.
   Hussein gathered the 60 members of the National Charter
committee on Tuesday and pleaded on television for a pact that will
guarantee tolerance for conflicting viewpoints.
   ``The new phase with we are about to begin will pave the way for
the resumption of political pluralism, which is another cornerstone
of democracy,'' the 54-year-old king said.
   ``The constitutional parliamentary life is our common choice,
and the path from which there will be no turning back.''
   His speech had historic importance for this country of 3.1
million people.
   In November, Hussein oversaw Jordan's first national election
since 1967, one of the freest ever held in the Arab world.
   He said the charter would form ``a broad and flexible framework
for national action'' and would regulate ``the state's various
activities in politics, economy, security, social affairs and
culture.''
   He cautioned that without good will and agreement on basic
concepts, ``democracy turns into anarchy'' and develops ``fangs and
talons that tear at the fabric of national unity and destroy the
achievements and gains of the state.''
   Hussein, who has ruled since 1953, is relinquishing many powers
but retains firm control and is personally popular.
   The king said his July 1988 decision to renounce claims to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank in favor of the Palestine Liberation
Organization led to last November's parliamentary election.
   The West Bank, captured in the 1967 Middle East war, held half
the seats in Jordan's old Parliament. It is not represented in the
new body.
   Hussein said four days of widespread rioting over economic
problems and government policies one year ago led him to seek the
National Charter.
   He said the riots showed that elections alone ``would be an
insufficient remedy'' because Jordanians held ``varying convictions
on some of the fundamental tenets and precepts upon which the
kingdom is founded.''
   The king banned political parties in 1957 following an
unsuccessful leftist coup attempt.
   A non-party Parliament continued intermittently until 1974.
After a 10-year hiatus, it was revived in 1984 despite the lack of
elections since 1967.
   ``Anyone who thinks that I was comfortable with the situation
which prevailed in the absence of an elected Parliament, or that I
was happy bearing most of the burden (of government), is
mistaken,'' said Hussein.
   He said the parties of the 1950s, when pan-Arab forces tried to
spread their influence across national borders, ``were governed by
the positions and dictates of their leaders from abroad.''
   He accused them of seeking ``power at the expense of democracy''
and of violating ``another tenet of political pluralism, which is
to refrain from violence.''
   The king repeated that ``Jordan's commitment to help the
Palestinian people and their just cause is a historic and fateful
part of its national commitment.
   ``Jordan will continue to exert all available resources to
support the struggle of the Palestinian people under its national
leadership, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization.''
   Roughly half of Jordan's people come from Palestinian families
who fled or were driven from their homes by Israel's creation or
its capture of the West Bank.

   President Bush said Tuesday there's an ``awful
lot to be done'' before next month's superpower summit. He added
that he doesn't want to suggest that complete agreement is possible
in advance on a new arms control treaty.
   Bush, on a brief visit to Canada, also issued a fresh warning to
Mikhail Gorbachev to refrain from using force in the breakaway
republic of Lithuania. But he coupled his words with praise for the
Soviet president's commitment to ``peaceful change and the
evolution of democracy'' in Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Bush said the presence of Soviet tanks in Lithuania make it
``even more important to have good-faith negotiations'' over the
fate of the republic.
   ``I would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence
to encourage dialogue and discussion,'' he said.
   Bush and Gorbachev are scheduled to meet in the United States
beginning May 30.
   Bush also said he didn't know enough about the release of three
European hostages in Beirut earlier in the day to say whether
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi deserved any of the credit for their
release.
   ``If indeed a person deserves credit for facilitating the
release of people held against their will ... I would say fine,
give the person credit,'' he said.
   As for Gadhafi, Bush said, ``we've got some major differences
with Libya that continue to exist, but look, who am I to argue in
this case if someone can help free one hostage? ... give that
person credit.''
   Bush spoke first with reporters aboard Air Force One en route
from Washington. He and Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime
minister, fielded reporters' questions after their private meeting
on the upcoming summit and other topics, and before attending a
baseball game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers
in Toronto's domed stadium.
   Bush flew back to Washington later in the evening.
   Before the game, Bush said he was looking forward to throwing
out the first ball.
   ``I'm going to go with a slider this time,'' he said. ``I've had
such good luck in the last couple of years. The catcher let me down
one time when he couldn't get into the dirt and grab it properly.''
   For his part, the Canadian leader said he looked forward to
negotiations with the United States on an acid rain treaty, with
the talks to begin after Congress approves clean air legislation.
   Both leaders said they were hoping Gorbachev would avoid the use
of force in Lithuania, and Bush renewed his earlier statements that
the future of superpower relations could be affected by what the
Soviets do in their attempt to deal with the secession crisis at
home.
   He said the United States hopes ``they will conduct themselves
in a way that can move the dramatic progress that's taken place in
the last year or so even further forward.''
   Asked whether he was basing his foreign policy on the fate of a
single man, Bush said that wasn't the case. He then added, ``In
this case Mr. Gorbachev, the president, has a record of encouraging
or certainly acquiescing in the peaceful evolution'' in Eastern
Europe. ``He has demonstrated that he is committed to peaceful
change and the evolution of democracy.''
   Mulroney said he agreed with Bush that Gorbachev represents a
new kind of Soviet leader _ ``more attractive and more realistic
and ... appears to be much more in keeping with some if not all of
the values that we in the West defend.''
   He said the Soviet leader had displayed ``reasonableness that we
had not come to know in earlier Soviet leaders.''
   Earlier, on his plane, Bush said there was an ``awful lot to be
done'' on arms control in advance of his meeting with Gorbachev,
and said, ``I can't predict how much will be done by the time the
summit rolls around.''
   He said it was a good thing to have a date set and ``obviously
this will serve as a bit of a catalyst or goal for getting things
done.''
   He said he didn't want to ``suggest we're going to have all the
details worked out by the time of the summit.''
   ``You deal with what's on the table,'' Bush said.
   The superpowers are negotiating agreements on long-range nuclear
weapons, chemical arms and troop and tank levels in Europe.
   Bush said combining the baseball game between the Toronto Blue
Jays and the Texas Rangers with the Mulroney meeting ``just seemed
like a wonderful way to do it.'' The president's son, George Walker
Bush, is part owner of the Rangers.
   The meeting with Mulroney is the first in a series of talks Bush
plans this month with Western leaders before the summit in
Washington.
   Bush will fly to Bermuda on Friday to meet with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and will hold talks with French
President Francois Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla., on April 19.
   The president enjoys a strong friendship with Mulroney. The
prime minister and his family were guests last year at the Bush
seaside vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Canadian Ambassador Derek H. Burney said Monday that Canada was
in a ``unique position these days in Washington'' in terms of
``access and influence.''
   ``The fact that we are able to get attention to Canadian
concerns when we want to ... speaks well for continued economic
growth in Canada, as well as providing us with an opportunity of
influence in helping address some of the more pressing
international issues,'' Burney said.

<TEXT>
   Sculptor Jim Gary looks at the rusting oil pan
from a junked automobile and he sees the gaping jaw of a dinosaur.
   Under his welding torch, the metallic bones and joints of
extinct automotive behemoths from Detroit are reincarnated as
Gary's artistic vision of the prehistoric giants that crawled from
the ooze to roam our planet millions of years ago.
   Gary, a self-taught sculptor from Farmingdale, N.J., has built
more than 200 of his ``20th century dinosaurs'' from the brake
shoes, universal joints, leaf springs, drive shafts, hoods, front
ends and other parts of scrapped cars and trucks.
   Some of his larger creatures, he says, required more than 500
parts from as many as a dozen automobiles and took a year to
complete. He prefers the parts from older cars, dating back to
1960, because they have more character.
   One of his biggest dinosaurs, the 57-foot-long Diplodocus,
contains more than $5,000 worth of junk parts.
   The plates along the arched back of the evil-looking Stegosaurus
were a challenge. Gary finally took them from the inner walls of a
wrecked garbage compactor.
   Eighteen of Gary's skeletal dinosaur sculptures in rich yellows,
greens, purples and blues or natural rust, plus four brightly
colored dragon flies, are making their Washington debut Thursday at
the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.
   The works will be on display through Aug. 10 as part of a new
museum show titled ``Dinamation's Dinosaurs Alive and in Color,''
which features a collection of computer-controlled robotic
dinosaurs that roar and squeal, rip meat from carcasses, tend their
offspring and crane their necks toward spectators.
   The main show, now touring the United States, was created by
Dinamation International Corp. of California and will be on view at
the museum through Sept. 3 for an admission fee of $4 for adults
and $2 for children. Gary's exhibit will be free.
   His dinosaurs have toured museums in the United States, Japan
and Australia since 1979. They have been pictured in school
textbooks, magazines and an encyclopedia, and made an appearance in
the George Lucas movie, ``Howard the Duck.''
   Gary learned about cars as a kid growing up in Colts Neck, N.J.,
where he picked up enough junkyard parts to build and license two
homemade jalopies. Years later, as a sculptor searching for unusual
art supplies, he returned to his old childhood haunts.
   ``When I saw those heaps of junked cars,'' he said, ``it
reminded me of an elephant graveyard. Just as elephants went to the
graveyard to die, those old cars went to the junkyard to die.''
   Gary saw a parallel between old cars and dinosaurs, the
chrome-finned gas guzzlers and the prehistoric plant eaters. Both
died out and were replaced by smaller, more fuel-efficient species.
   ``The car really is an animal. It has its own metabolism and
needs fuel, air and water to exist,'' he said. ``To survive it had
to change, just like the dinosaurs. The evolution of the two is
obvious.''
   Gary envisions the junkyard as a burial ground for the discarded
artifacts of 20th century technology, where future scientists might
study the remains of scrapped cars just as paleontologists examine
fossils for clues about how dinosaurs lived and died.
   ``It's not my intention to suggest that the auto industry is
going the way of the dinosaur,'' Gary said hastily. ``I'm just
doing my work as a sculptor.''

   Union officials accused by Greyhound officials
of organizing strike violence contend a $30 million civil suit
filed by the company is merely an excuse not to return to the
bargaining table.
   ``We have consistently asked this company to present its
evidence. We know that there is no evidence. They've simply pointed
the finger of blame at employees and used the issue as a smoke
screen'' for not resuming negotiations, union spokesman Nick
Nichols said Monday after Greyhound filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The suit claimed that unlawful actions by the Amalgamated
Transit Union and 20 union officers have cost the company at least
$10 million. It accused the union of violating provisions of the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which
allows triple damages to be assessed.
   Nichols noted that no government agency has filed criminal
charges against union officers. ``Anyone can hire a lawyer and
submit some documents to the court,'' he said.
   The strike, called on March 2, has been marked by shootings,
bomb threats and other incidents. The company has said it won't
resume negotiations until a week goes by without an act of violence.
   Greyhound Vice President Anthony P. Lannie, who announced the
suit in Washington, maintained that several specific offenses
showed a pattern of racketeering activity, including extortion,
attempted murder, obstruction of justice, interference with
interstate commerce and arson.
   He charged that, through violent activities, union officials
were attempting to ``win an inflated financial settlement they
could never achieve through lawful, collective bargaining. There is
a word for that _ extortion.''
   Union officers allegedly assigned rank-and-file members violent
tasks and then paid them from the union's strike defense fund, the
suit contended.
   ``That's false and ridiculous,'' said Fred Ingram, president of
ATU Local 1493 in Charlotte, N.C., and one of two local presidents
the company has asked the court to replace with a receiver. ``We
have never ordered anybody to do anything. I don't know where
that's coming from.''
   Strikers are paid $50 a week in strike benefits for manning
picket lines, he said.
   Ingram contended that the company filed the lawsuit to divert
attention from its refusal to resume contract negotiations. ``Their
whole plan from the beginning has been to get rid of the union,''
he said.
   Last month, a replacement driver in Fayetteville, N.C., swore an
assault charge against Ingram following a picket line altercation.
   Besides Ingram, the suit seeks to have Rafael Rivera, president
of Local 1600 in Atlanta, removed from office.
   About 6,300 Greyhound drivers and 3,000 maintenance and other
workers walked out over wages and job security. Greyhound, the
nation's only nationwide bus system, has been operating on a
reduced schedule with replacement drivers it hired and union
members who crossed the picket line.

<HEAD>Mob Attacks Rival's Office With Backhoe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police protection didn't prevent an attack on an
underworld's office by a rival in a backhoe who destroyed a police
car, a guard house and a garage before 10 officers shot out the
vehicle's tires, officials said.
   It was the second time this year that a member of Japan's
largest underworld organization, the Yamaguchi-gumi group, used
such a heavy construction vehicle against the office of the rival
Takenaka-gumi, a local police official said.
   Two police officers and one mob member were injured in Sunday's
attack in Okayama, 345 miles west of Toyko.
   Police said the backhoe, driven by Toshiyuki Okamoto, 24,
dragged a patrol car 33 feet and smashed into the police guard
house when officers tried to stop the attack.
   Okamoto damaged the office building's gate and garage and
several cars by repeatedly ramming into the building, police said.
   Authorities often station police officers outside gang offices
when violence is expected to protect the neighborhood and hopefully
prevent confrontations.
   One policeman was stabbed when he stopped one of several people
who came out of the Takenaka-gumi office and tried to attack
Okamoto, who was protected by the backhoe's bullet-proof cab, the
official said.
   Okamoto and the man who stabbed the officer were both arrested.
   The Takenaka-gumi broke with the Yamaguchi-gumi last year in
protest over the appointment of Yoshinori Watanabe as the new gang
boss.
   Watanabe's predecessor, Masahisa Takenaka, was killed in a
leadership dispute in 1985. The Takenaka-gumi now is led by
Masahisa Takenaka's younger brother, Masashi.
   Police say the Yamaguchi-gumi has about 21,000 members
nationwide. The Takenaka-gumi is widely believed to have been
reduced to about 20 members.
   Police estimate Japan has 90,000 mob members, nearly half
associated with the three largest gangs _ the Yamaguchi-gumi and
the Tokyo-based Inagawa-kai and Sumiyoshi Rengo.
   Members often wear badges identifying them as gang members,
although they do not admit to criminal activity.
   Police say the gangs are involved in extortion, illicit
gambling, the drug and sex trades, and money laundering. Some also
have interests in the construction, real estate and entertainment
businesses.

<HEAD>Some Lawmakers Back Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some lawmakers are readying legislation to
halt all U.S. aid to Iraq as tensions mount over a series of
incidents, including a threat by President Saddam Hussein to use
chemical weapons against Israel.
   ``We should be ashamed'' of the U.S. trading relationship with
Iraq, said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
   Berman has drafted proposed sanctions that would end all U.S.
assistance to Iraq, including agricultural credits and investment
guarantees under the Export-Import Bank.
   Several others in Congress, including Sens. William Cohen,
R-Maine, and John McCain, R-Ariz., said they support some kind of
sanctions against the Baghdad government.
   ``I think we ought to take action,'' Cohen said recently, adding
it was ``not an acceptable situation'' for the United States to be
doing business with a country seeking to add nuclear weapons to an
arsenal that already includes chemical weapons.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he will push for legislation to impose
sanctions against any nation that uses chemical weapons illegally.
   But not everyone in Congress favors immediate sanctions.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said it would be premature to do
anything without first talking with Hussein. Specter, who visited
Iraq in January with Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., urged Hussein to
``exercise restraint.''
   ``We believe discussions and negotiations can go far to resolve
current tensions,'' Specter and Shelby said in a letter to Hussein.
   The outrage among some in Congress comes amid growing tension
over Iraq's actions. Hussein has been criticized for threatening to
use chemical weapons against Israel and for executing an
Iranian-born British journalist accused of spying.
   Last month, U.S. and British intelligence agents broke up an
Iraqi smuggling ring allegedly trying to obtain nuclear triggers
for atomic weapons. Iraq denied the charge.
   On Monday, Iraq expelled an American diplomat in retaliation for
the expulsion of an Iraqi diplomat posted at the United Nations.
The State Department said the Iraqi was suspected of being involved
in a plot to kill two political opponents.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, said Iraq's
decision to expel the American was ``totally inappropriate.''
   The sour climate prompted the Commerce Department to cancel the
Iraqi leg of a trade mission scheduled to visit Iraq, Saudi Arabia
and Egypt in May.
   ``We thought it was inappropriate to take a group of U.S.
companies to Iraq at this time,'' said Elizabeth Dugan, a Commerce
Department spokeswoman.
   Nine aerospace companies signed up to travel to the Mideast on a
mission to ``help U.S. companies enhance their market position
overseas and gain market exposure,'' the department said.
   ``Iraq has ambitious plans for upgrading its civil aviation
system, including new airports, air traffic control and related
equipment,'' the statement said.
   Berman has criticized the Bush and Reagan administrations for
allegedly having a ``soft spot'' for Iraq. Ms. Tutwiler said U.S.
relations with Iraq have been ``complex and sometimes disturbing''
since the restoration of diplomatic ties in 1985.
   Berman said Iraq has received about $1 billion a year in
agricultural credits from the United States since 1984.
   The United States imported about $1.5 billion worth of goods,
mainly oil, from Iraq in 1988, the Commerce Department said. It
exported about $1.1 billion in goods to Iraq, mostly agriculture
products.

<HEAD>MCI Seeks Boost in Long Distance Market With Telecom Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telecommunications industry analysts say MCI's
merger with Telecom USA Inc. will give the nation's second-largest
long-distance company a chance for greater inroads into a market
still dominated by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   That could mean good news for consumers, they say, and even AT&amp;T
is saying it hopes to benefit from the tougher competition.
   MCI Communications Corp. and Telecom USA, the fourth largest
company in the long distance market, said Monday that MCI would
acquire all outstanding shares of Telecom USA's stock for $42 a
share, for a total price of $1.25 billion.
   The transaction is subject to approval by Telecom's
stockholders. The Federal Communications Commission also would have
to grant approval and the Justice Department would review whether
the deal would violate antitrust laws.
   ``It's a strategically important move,'' Bert C. Roberts Jr.,
MCI's president and chief operating officer, said in an interview.
``It immediately brings us additional market share of about 1{
percent and against AT&amp;T, as dominant a competitor as they are,
that efficiency is very important.''
   Industry analysts agreed the acquisition should give MCI a
strong boost, despite the cost, because of Telecom's active moves
in advanced technology.
   ``This shows the industry is consolidating at a very fast pace.
AT&amp;T is a very aggressive competitor and you have to move rapidly
to grow. This gives MCI a further boost,'' said Charles Nichols, a
telecommunications industry analyst for Prudential-Bache securities.
   Nichols and other analysts played down the stock market reaction
to the Monday's announcement, which sent Telecom USA soaring $16.25
to $38.12{ a share trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MCI
dipped $1.12{ to $35.75 a share on the over-the-counter market.
   ``We think this puts MCI and Telecom in a favorable position,''
said Cathy Clarke, senior analyst for The Yankee Group, a
Boston-based consulting and marketing firm.
   ``MCI is growing and this will increase their potential'' to
gain more of the market and provide more services, she said.
   The cost ``will have no effect on our ability to fund growth,''
said Roberts. ``We're in a very cash-strong position. You're going
to see that debt paid off very quickly, within a couple of years.''
   MCI revenues increased more than 20 percent in 1989 to $6.5
billion, while Telecom had revenues of $713 million in sales last
year. Atlanta-based Telecom was formed in 1988 with the merger of
Southernet of Atlanta and Teleconnect of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and
serves customers primarily in the Southeast and Midwest.
   AT&amp;T holds 64 percent of the long distance market, down from
about 90 percent before the court-ordered breakup of the old Bell
system in 1984. MCI has 12 percent and US Sprint is third with 9
percent, according to the most recent FCC figures.
   MCI will gain the digital network and the fiber optic systems
Telecom has in place. ``They're going to gain a lot of network
miles,'' said The Yankee Group's Clarke.
   ``In this type of merger, we expect to see cost savings,
improved quality of service, improvements for customers such as
one-stop shopping. So, overall, this should be good news for
consumers,'' she said.
   Even AT&amp;T said it was a good move. The former monopoly is trying
to convince the FCC that there is enough competition in the market
to lift some regulations aimed solely at AT&amp;T.
   ``This development ... suggests two vigorous companies are
combining forces to provide even more competition,'' said AT&amp;T
spokesman Herb Linnen. ``We wake up every day to a real knockdown,
drag-out fight in the marketplace.''
   Paul Thibeau, spokesman for No. 3 Sprint, suggested there may be
more mergers and acquisitions in the industry in the struggle to
chip away at AT&amp;T. The MCI move ``should come as no surprise to
those who follow the telecommunications industry,'' he said. ``We
continue to explore similar opportunities.''
   ``MCI will continue to focus on strategic acquisitions that make
sense,'' said Roberts.

<HEAD>G7 Countries Giving Weak Support to Japan's Effort to Boost Yen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan isn't getting a lot of support from the
United States and other major economic powers in its effort to
check the steep decline of the yen, many economists say.
   After a weekend meeting of financial ministers in Paris, the
Group of Seven industrial nations warned that the yen's recent
decline has ``undesirable consequences.''
   The group, consisting of the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy, pledged to ``keep these
developments under review'' and reaffirmed its commitment to
``cooperation in exchange markets.''
   However, on Monday, the central banks of the group followed the
statement with only weak and uncoordinated intervention, traders
said. Central banks intervene by buying yen in an attempt to push
up its price.
   Also, there was no indication that the United States and West
Germany were inclined to cut their interest rates to bolster the
yen.
   ``They're basically leaving Japan twisting in the wind,'' said
economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington-based consultant. ``There
was just enough intervention so the Japanese wouldn't have egg all
over their face.''
   Economists said although the Group of Seven's statement was
slightly stronger in tone than expected, it will not halt the yen's
slide unless Japan does more to shore up its economy.
   Turmoil in the Japanese stock market and political instability
have helped push the yen down 11 percent in value compared with the
dollar this year. It hit a three-year low of 160 yen to the dollar
early last week before recovering somewhat before the meeting.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.02 yen to 156.45 yen Monday. But
later in New York, the dollar traded at 158.335 yen, up from
Friday's 157.70 yen.
   ``The market is just not really sure of the G-7's resolve. ...
They're going to have to come in collectively and so far they
haven't. The intervention has seemed more of a gesture than a real
movement,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a currency trader in New York with
the Bank of Boston.
   In order to stabilize its currency long term, Japan will have to
further increase its interest rates, said economist David Wyss of
DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   An increase in Japanese rates relative to U.S. rates makes the
yen a more attractive investment and raises its value. The Bank of
Japan raised its discount rate from 4.25 percent to 5.25 percent on
March 20, but it was not enough to stem the yen's slide.
   Since a March 23 meeting in Los Angeles between Japanese Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, Japan had been asking for interest rate cuts in the United
States and West Germany.
   But other countries are not inclined to help the Japanese at the
expense of their own economic objectives, analysts said.
   The West Germans fear that lower rates will increase
inflationary pressures in their country, where the economy already
is being stimulated by the prospect for investment in Eastern
Europe and monetary union with East Germany.
   In the United States, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to
cut rates until clearer evidence emerges that inflation is
moderating.
   ``For the Fed to lower interest rates in the current inflation
environment is not in the cards,'' said economist Allen Sinai of
the Boston Co.
   In contrast with the Fed, the Bush administration favors lower
U.S. interest rates, both to stimulate economic growth and to help
the U.S. trade deficit, economists said.
   A weak yen pushes up the trade deficit by making Japanese goods
less expensive in the United States and raising the price of U.S.
goods in Japan.
   The Group of Seven officials will get a chance to re-evaluate
their stance at their next meeting in early May in Washington.

<TEXT>
   Extra, extra, read all about it:
Woman gives birth to fish!
   If that's too tame, how about randy spooks impregnating maidens?
Or perhaps a ``routine'' appearance by the Virgin Mary?
   Such reports are a staple of Manila's lively tabloids, among the
most widely read of the city's more than 20 dailies.
   In a country where the truth is often bizarre enough, English
and Tagalog language tabloids dish out fantasy and flamboyance for
those who find the broadsheet dailies too tame.
   The latest titillation was the saga of ``Goldfish Flores
Pascua,'' a six-inch-long mudfish supposedly ``born'' to Lilian
Pascua, 22, of Paniqui in Tarlac province.
   Several Manila tabloids reported that Mrs. Pascua gave birth to
the fish March 31 and named it ``Goldfish.'' Tabloids splashed
pictures of ``Goldfish,'' swimming in a water basin, and its
``parents'' on their front pages.
   For several days, tabloids regaled their readers with details of
the couple's plans to baptize the fish on Palm Sunday, despite
healthy skepticism by local officials.
   ``I think a fish should not be baptized and registered because
it doesn't even have the resemblance of a man,'' said Paniqui Mayor
Cesar Cuchapin.
   The baptism controversy was resolved when tabloids reported last
week that ``Goldfish's'' short but celebrated life had come to an
end. It was eaten by the family dog.
   With ``Goldfish'' history, the tabloid Ang Pilipino Ngayon, or
Filipino Today, reported today that an 8-year-old boy had given
birth by caesarian section in a hospital in Pampanga province. The
baby, a boy, was still-born, the tabloid reported.
   Not to be scooped, Manila radio station DZXL telephoned the
hospital and spoke with an official, who confirmed that something
resembling a fetus had been extracted from the boy.
   ``How could he give birth when he is only 8 years old,'' the
reporter asked, apparently more curious over age than the sex
peculiarity. The official was at a loss for a response.
   Many of the far-fetched reports play on traditions of mysticism
and superstition which run deep in this predominately Roman
Catholic country.
   ``Goldfish'' attracted almost as much attention as a teen-aged
girl in Laguna province, who the tabloids reported two years ago
became pregnant by the spirit of a 19th century cleric.
   Apparitions by the Virgin Mary are frequently reported, although
the church hierarchy tends to give them little credence. The most
recent was reported last year, when the Virgin supposedly appeared
in a coconut grove southeast of Manila.
   Last month, the former governor of Cagayan province, Rudolfo
Aquinaldo, eluded troops seeking to arrest him for trying to
overthrow the government and fled into the mountains with armed
followers.
   One tabloid quoted Cagayan residents as saying Aguinaldo was
protected by an amulet which ``gives him the characteristics of a
dog,'' not always a blessing in an area where puppies are prized as
food.
   But the tabloid explained that with the amulet, Aquinaldo ``can
smell his enemies coming.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Seeks Stricter Regulation of Cosmetics Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say there
is no need to increase regulation of their industry because their
voluntary efforts already are ensuring the safety of their products.
   But Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., says a General Accounting Office
report to Congress shows that this self-regulation approach isn't
working and may be allowing unsafe products on the market.
   The report by the investigating arm of Congress found that most
manufacturers of personal care products _ which include everything
from toothpaste to bubble bath _ are not signing up for voluntary
federal oversight.
   The Food and Drug Administration has no authority to require
these manufacturers to let the agency know they exist, to provide
safety-testing data on their products or reports on adverse
reactions.
   Without at least a registration requirement, ``anyone could make
cosmetics in their bathtub and not have to tell the FDA their
location or any information about the product. That's absurd,''
said Wyden, who requested the report.
   Of the 2,000 to 2,500 companies that FDA estimates are making
cosmetics products, 778 were registered with the agency as of July
1989 _ about 31 to 39 percent.
   The Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association estimates
there are at most 2,000 manufacturers and that 60 percent of them
are registered.
   ``There isn't a serious safety problem. ... If there was ... the
agency would know about it and the public would know about it,''
said Michael Petrina, the group's vice president for legislative
relations.
   The association, the main trade organization for the cosmetics
industry, has been encouraging manufacturers to register
voluntarily with the FDA, he said.
   It also has been collecting and reviewing safety data on
chemicals used in cosmetics, Petrina said, noting that registration
grew by 94 companies from 1988 to 1989.
   ``The FDA has plenty of information now to make any judgments to
deal with any safety concerns,'' he said. ``We don't think the FDA
needs any more authority to regulate. ... We don't think it makes
any sense to divert their scarce resources to an industry that has
a demonstrated safety record.''
   Petrina noted that government regulations do require that
ingredients of personal-care products be listed on the labels of
retail products sold to consumers. Noncommercial products sold for
professional use in business establishments, such as beauty salons,
are exempt from that requirement.
   Wyden said the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, on the books since
1938, should be rewritten to require cosmetics manufacturers to
register with the FDA and provide data on safety tests and injury
reports. He said he expects to introduce such legislation later
this year.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said: ``The agency is doing what it
can to regulate the industry under the authority Congress gave
it.'' Asked if the FDA needs more authority, Nesbit said, ``It's
Congress' responsibility to write the laws.''

<TEXT>
   The gold lettering on the plate-glass
window reads simply: Law Office. Inside works Rhode Island's
busiest criminal lawyer _ a man who has built a career by
representing reputed organized crime figures.
   ``I've never discouraged people from referring to me as a mob
lawyer,'' John F. ``Jack'' Cicilline said between drags on his
cigarette. ``I suppose to some people it's a sinister connotation,
but it's done me well. Someone has to represent these people.''
   But Cicilline does more than defend people such as reputed mob
boss Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca _ he befriends them.
   Pictures of Patriarca and his late father, legendary organized
crime leader Raymond L.S. Patriarca, hang in Cicilline's office. On
the opposite wall is a framed copy of a 1983 indictment against
Cicilline _ charges he eventually beat.
   Cicilline rents his office from Patriarca in the city's Italian
section _ not far from where he grew up.
   His father wanted him to become a lawyer. Although he originally
planned on entering the foreign service, he's glad he followed his
father's advice. ``I love doing this work,'' he said.
   Cicilline put himself through law school, commuting 60 miles to
Boston's Suffolk University while working days to support the wife
with whom he'd eloped as a teen-ager.
   The balding 51-year-old sees himself as on the front line
defending civil rights. He said his small firm, which includes two
of his five children, takes ``more than our fair share'' of cases
from poor people.
   ``I see myself as one of the last survivors of the battle
against the system taking over,'' he said.
   Two of Cicilline's clients were arrested last month in an FBI
sweep. Patriarca and Matthew Guglielmetti Jr. are charged with
racketeering.
   Partriarca, 45, has been identified in testimony before the U.S.
Senate as head of the New England Cosa Nostra. Guglielmetti,
Cicilline's golf partner, is named in last month's indictment as a
lieutenant in charge of the Patriarca family's Connecticut
operation.
   That doesn't faze Cicilline, who said his ``commonality'' with
some of his clients has forged friendships that have survived even
though ``a lot of them are in jail.''
   ``I've never heard anyone say his reputation has been impaired
or sullied in any way because of the company he keeps,'' said
Presiding Superior Court Judge Anthony A. Giannini.
   ``Jack is a very sensitive, warm guy,'' said Dick Casparian,
chief public defender.
   But when asked about Cicilline's personal relationship with some
clients, Casparian said he had never developed such a friendship in
16 years as a criminal lawyer.
   Cicilline said he knows nothing about organized crime. As to the
guilt or innocence of his clients and friends, Cicilline said:
   ``I've heard what's said about a lot of my clients. I don't know
if it's true and it doesn't bother me even if it is true.''
   Cicilline said he got involved in representing reputed mobsters
as a young lawyer trying to build a practice.
   ``You've got to take little risks,'' said Cicilline. ``Risking
my reputation is a risk I was willing to take.
   ``I can't say I didn't enjoy seeing my name in the paper with
people who were expected to be seen with the best lawyer money
could buy.''
   That strategy, with a healthy dose of talent, made Cicilline
into the state's busiest criminal lawyer. He takes on about 25
percent of the criminal cases that don't go to the public
defender's office, according to Giannini. That doesn't include the
many cases he handles in federal court.
   Although Cicilline has the respect of his colleagues, many
refuse to talk about his private life. A half-dozen law enforcement
officials also refused to comment on Cicilline.
   In 1980, the FBI bugged Cicilline's office. In 1983, an
informant wore a wire during a meeting with the lawyer and mobster
Frank L. ``Bobo'' Marrapese Jr. After a mistrial and a hung jury,
Cicilline cleared himself of charges he conspired to persuade a
witness to lie.
   ``He's aware of the tightrope that he chooses to walk,'' one
police officer said, demanding anonymity.

<HEAD>Democratic Forum Lays Emphasis On Tradition, For Gradual Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A historian has emerged as Hungary's
most powerful political figure after leading to electoral victory a
conservative party that appeals to the Hungarian pride long stifled
under the Communists.
   Jozsef Antall, 58, dominates the Hungarian Democratic Forum,
which has been vilified by critics as nationalistic and
anti-Semitic.
   He and other senior party officials deny such charges.
   They say the party's emphasis on traditional Hungarian values,
including a strong sense of the Hungarian nation that extends to
minorities outside the country's frontiers, has been misunderstood.
   Nevertheless, the Forum may be courting trouble with its
militant championing of Hungarian minority rights in neighboring
countries.
   With victory assured after Sunday's second round of
parliamentary elections, Antall told a cheering crowd on Monday
that his government will be the spokesman of 15 million Hungarians.
   He was referring not only to Hungary's 11 million people, but to
those in neighboring countries _ mainly Romania _ who became
foreign citizens after the 1920 Trianon peace treaty.
   Last month, Romania was the site of the most violent
anti-Hungarian riots in recent memory. Its leaders are already
worried about Hungarian interference and may not be keen on the
idea of more intense scrutiny of the fate of Hungarians within its
borders.
   Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, also home to
Hungarian minorities, could object as well.
   Once in office, the Forum may have no choice but to change its
priorities and deal with specter of economic collapse.
   A foreign debt of more than $20 billion, growing unemployment
and double-digit inflation are some of the most worrisome legacies
of centralized economic planning that must be dealt with as
Hungary's new leaders embrace free market reforms.
   From its inception in September 1987, at the outset of the
democratization process that led to the elections, the center-right
Democratic Forum incorporated three major trends _ a strong
national consciousness, Christian democracy and economic liberalism.
   In the elections, the Forum captured 165 of the 386
parliamentary seats at stake and is expected to forge a governing
coalition with the Smallholders Party and Christian Democrats that
would control nearly 60 percent of the legislature.
   As little as a year ago, Jozsef Antall was a virtual unknown.
   A man of patrician bearing, Antall was born April 8, 1932, a
scion of the landed gentry. His father was a widely respected
leader of the Independent Smallholders' Party, and the Democratic
Forum embraces many of the pre-war Smallholder ideas.
   The young Antall studied law, economics and history and was
teaching high school when the anti-Stalinist revolt broke out in
1956 only to be crushed by Soviet tanks.
   Active on the side of the revolutionaries, he took part in the
brief revival of the the Smallholders' Party. In a January magazine
interview, he called the revolution a ``pivotal event'' in his life.
   After the revolution, he was arrested and barred from teaching.
He later gained employment as a librarian and in 1964 joined the
Semmelweis Medical History Museum, to be made its director 10 years
later.
   Although invited, Antall did not attend the founding meeting of
the Democratic Forum because he was outside the country. But he
became intensely involved soon after the party's creation, refusing
leadership posts with both the revived Smallholders and the
Christian Democrats.
   He was elected Forum leader in October.
   Antall the politician seeks to project the image of a
thoughtful, benign, wise surrogate father. The Forum's main
campaign slogan was ``Calm Force.''
   Even his political rivals gave him top marks for his performance
in the talks last year between a coalition of leading opposition
groups and the then-ruling Communist party.
   But other leaders have marred the image of the party, some of
whom have vilified the liberal League of Free Democrats _ the party
with the highest percentage of former anti-Communist dissidents _
as latter-day Bolsheviks.
   Forum deputy chairman Istvan Csurka even used radio time to make
comments deemed anti-Semitic by his critics.
   The party emphatically disavows any anti-Jewish sentiments. It
attributes much of the anti-Semitism in Hungary to the knowledge
that many of the country's discredited former Communist leaders
were Jewish.

   The ice is breaking on northern Wisconsin
lakes, signaling the start of another tense spring when protesters
head to boat landings to confront Indians who use spears to catch
spawning fish.
   The first boats of Chippewa Indian spearfishers are expected to
venture onto off-reservation waters tonight to exercise a right
guaranteed by 19th century federal treaties.
   Despite pleas for peace, this spring's spearfishing season is
expected to renew confrontations between the Chippewa and sport
anglers, who claim spearfishing is an unfair, outdated practice
that thins game fish populations.
   Observers are unsure whether tensions will escalate from a year
ago, when more than 200 protesters were arrested and the state and
local sheriff's departments spent nearly $2 million to patrol the
lakes.
   Nick Hockings of the Wa-Swa-Gon Treaty Association, a group on
the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa reservation that organizes
spearfishing outings, thinks the crowds of anti-spearfishing
protesters could be smaller, ``weeded out to your racists.''
   As many as 1,000 members of the American Indian Movement planned
to travel from Minnesota to northern Wisconsin lakes to support the
Chippewa.
   Courts have ruled the Chippewa are entitled to take up to 100
percent of the safe harvest _ the number of fish that can be taken
without harming future reproduction _ from each northern Wisconsin
lake.
   But the Chippewa have agreed to limit their catch this year to
54 percent of the safe harvest, or about 41,410 walleyed pike on
178 lakes. The season usually lasts about three weeks. In 1989, 271
spearfishers caught 16,054 walleye.
   In comparison, Wisconsin's sport anglers take more than 10 times
as many fish _ about 600,000 last year, according to the state
Department of Natural Resources.
   The St. Croix Chippewa band plans to start the spearfishing
season tonight in northwestern Wisconsin's Polk County, sending
about 20 fishermen out, Tribal Vice Chairman Ed Bearheart said.
   The most active spearfishing band _ the Lac du Flambeau _ is
planning its first excursion perhaps Saturday.
   Groups opposed to Indian spearfishing _ Stop Treaty
Abuse-Wisconsin and Protect Americans' Rights and Resources _ have
said they would not begin anti-spearfishing protests before Sunday.
   Dean Crist, a spokesman for Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, said
Monday that unless the Lac du Flambeau band agrees to spear only 10
percent of its allowable catch, his group will urge large-scale
demonstrations at the lakes.
   ``It is no different than a soldier going to war,'' Crist said.
``Nobody in their right mind would like to stand out on a landing
all night but it is the only thing that works.''
   Putting protesters in boats to patrol the lakes where the
Indians spearfished caused waves last year that made it difficult
to see walleye, preventing tens of thousands of fish from being
caught, he said.
   The spearfishing dispute is rooted in treaties the Chippewa
signed when the tribe ceded millions of acres of northern Wisconsin
to the U.S. government in the 1800s.
   Since 1983, federal courts have said the Chippewa retained the
right to hunt, spearfish, cut timber and gather foods on
off-reservation land in the ceded territory.
   The rulings are being appealed, but state officials, including
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, said it could take nearly a decade for
lawsuits to move through the courts.
   Unlike their ancestors who used torches, modern-day spearfishers
wear hats with battery-operated lights. A walleye, sluggish in the
cold, shallow water, is stunned when it sees the light. Using iron
spears, the Indians stab the fish from boats.
   Each spearfishing season has seen a gradual increase of tension
and confrontations, but state officials predicted 1990 might bring
a downturn.
   ``I think this will be a more peaceful season than in the
past,'' said George Meyer, chief of enforcement for the state
Department of Natural Resources. ``While I don't believe tribal
spearfishermen will be lonely on boat landings, I believe there
will be reduced tensions and levels of anti-treaty rights
demonstrations. ... Many people understand the issue cannot be
resolved at boat landings.''

<HEAD>Kennedy Faces Long Odds on Peace Dividend Proposal</HEAD>

   Sen. Edward Kennedy faces an uphill battle in
his goal of turning the entire ``peace dividend'' over to domestic
programs instead of the deficit, the House Democratic leader says.
   Kennedy, in a speech at Georgetown University on Monday, said
billions of dollars cut from the defense budget should go not to
reducing the federal deficit but to long-neglected programs such as
education and health care.
   ``It is time to insist on what the American people and virtually
everyone in Congress already know,'' Kennedy said. ``There really
is a peace dividend and we must not throw it away.''
   But House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Congress
will almost certainly want to put some of the money saved by cuts
in the defense budget toward deficit reduction and some toward
reviving domestic programs.
   ``The likelihood is that we'll do both,'' Gephardt said in a
telephone interview. ``They're both high priorities. Each is a part
of rebuilding economic strength.''
   Gephardt agreed with Kennedy that the peace dividend should be
much larger than the Bush administration has proposed.
   According to Kennedy, as much as $170 billion in five years
should be placed in a ``National Needs Trust Fund'' and spent only
on ``critical'' domestic programs such as Head Start for preschool
children; national health insurance for the roughly 37 million
Americans with no coverage; and aid to communities and people
dislocated by military plant closures.
   Kennedy chided his Democratic colleagues for letting President
Bush control the national agenda and warned that unless the party
became more active in its opposition, the party would retain its
secondary status.
   ``There has been a kind of unnatural quiet coming from our
party, a sense of yielding ground to the president, of kowtowing to
his veto threats, of confining our own Democratic efforts to merely
marginal improvements in Republican proposals, of almost conceding
a second term to President Bush _ or hoping against hope that he
stumbles somewhere along the way,'' Kennedy said.
   Hard-line Republican views on defense spending helped bring
about the easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions and the spread of
democracy in Eastern Europe, Kennedy conceded. But he said the turn
of world events created an opportunity tailor-made for the
Democratic Party.
   ``Seldom have a period and a party been so well matched,'' he
said.

   Moviegoers shelled out $18.8 million at the
nation's movie theaters to see ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,''
making the film No. 1 at the box office again.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
``Ninja Turtles'' has made more than $50 million after just two
weeks. It's already the biggest money-maker yet for New Line Cinema.
   In second and showing few signs of fading was the comedy
``Pretty Woman,'' starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. The
movie collected $11.3 million, and the Walt Disney Co. said the
film is on a pace to equal the studio's 1987 hit ``Three Men and a
Baby.''
   In third was the new comedy ``Ernest Goes to Jail,'' featuring
Jim Varney in the latest sequel about the annoying dimwit title
character. The movie had ticket sales of $6.1 million, the best
opening yet in the Ernest trilogy.
   The new adventure ``The First Power'' opened well, too, making
$5.7 million in its first weekend of release. It was followed in
fifth by ``The Hunt for Red October,'' which netted $5 million.
   ``I Love You to Death,'' a comedy about adultery and murder for
hire, landed in sixth with a gate of $4 million. In seventh was the
best-picture Oscar winner, ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' grossing $3.2
million.
   The latest effort from bizarre director John Waters, ``Cry
Baby,'' opened in eighth place, collecting $3 million. It was
followed in ninth by the Dana Carvey comedy ``Opportunity Knocks''
with ticket sales of $2.1 million.

   POLAND:
   The once-banned Solidarity Free Trade Union won overwhelmingly
over the Communist party in partially democratic elections last
June that were agreed upon at historic negotiations between the
trade union and Communist leadership.
   In September, Solidarity formed the first government in Eastern
Europe not dominated by Communists, under Premier Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a Solidarity activist and journalist.
   Following the trend begun in Hungary, the old Communist Party
dissolved itself in Jaunary and a new Social Democracy Party was
formed.
   The 23-member Cabinet includes 12 Solidarity members, the others
are former members of the now-dissolved Communist party or of the
Peasant Party and the Democratic Party.
   President: Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, a now unaffiliated former
Communist elected by Parliament in July for a six-year term. His is
a more ceremonial post than Mazowiecki's.
   Fully free Senate elections and partially free Sejm (lower
house) elections were held in June and next elections are not due
until 1993, although they could be moved up when the constitution
is rewritten this year.
   The Senate has 99 senators from Solidarity and one independent.
   Since the Communist Party was dissolved, in the 460-seat Sejm
the former Communists have either joined other parties or are
unaffiliated.

   The flag flew at half-staff outside of a
high school where AIDS victim Ryan White was remembered as a model
student, and those who once fought to keep him out of school
mourned his absence.
   Students and administrators at Hamilton Heights High School wore
orange ribbons, mementoes of school pride, and began the day with a
10-minute convocation in memory of White, who found friendship and
acceptance here after a long legal battle to attend public school.
   ``I've said many times, as a teen-ager his age I probably would
have stayed home instead of coming to school every day,'' Principal
Steve Dillon said during an inpromptu news conference. ``He very
much wanted to be at school. He was very much a fighter.
   ``And I think every one of our lives is going to be a lot better
for knowing Ryan and participating in his last three years.''
   White, a junior, attended classes as recently as two weeks
before his death Sunday, 10 days after he was admitted to an
Indianapolis hospital with an AIDS-related respiratory infection.
He was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 5{ years
ago, having contracted the disease from blood products to treat his
hemophilia.
   The teen-ager attracted national attention during his successful
fight to attend school in his hometown of Kokomo and emerged as an
international spokesman for children suffering from AIDS. He is
credited with furthering understanding of the disease, its
devastating effects and the rights of its sufferers.
   After White won his court battle to attend school in Kokomo, he
and his family still felt uncomfortable there and moved to Cicero,
about 20 miles away, in 1987. His death elicited sympathy in his
former hometown.
   ``It's a terrible thing. I'd hoped from the beginning he could
have been the first to whip it,'' said Dan Carter, who was board
president at Western School Corp. when Ryan was banned from classes
there.
   ``He was a real educator for all of us and he showed a lot of
class,'' said Kokomo Mayor Robert Sargent.
   His contribution to AIDS awareness was remembered Monday night
with a candlelight vigil in downtown Indianapolis attended by about
50 people.
   ``He was brave, he brought people's awareness alive,'' said
Kevin Johnson, an AIDS organization volunteer who attended the
vigil and whose best friend has the disease. ``I think Ryan made a
big difference.''
   A funeral was planned for Wednesday.
   Dillon said he expected half of his school's 550 students and
several staff members would attend the funeral.
   Some of White's closest friends sought consolation Monday from
school counselors, Dillon said.
   ``I'm very pleased with the student body today. They're handling
it very well. We wanted to make sure they felt good about
themselves,'' Dillon said.
   He said the White's classmates should be proud that he ``could
attend school and have friends and go to dances and go to the
ballgames and not worry about any problems. He was very much a part
of our school body.''
   White's death was particularly hard to take for three young
Florida brothers suffering from AIDS who also fought to attend
school, their mother said.
   Louise Ray said her hemophiliac sons Ricky, 13, Robert, 12, and
Randy, 10, had met White, and his death reminded them of the
gravity of their own illnesses.
   ``It's a senseless death, in a way,'' she said. ``The boys are
going to miss him, and at this age it's hard for them to understand
why a young person has to die.''
   The brothers won a federal court order to attend school in
Arcadia, Fla., in 1987, but fire destroyed their home soon
afterward and the family fled to Sarasota, where they enrolled in
school without incident.

   A commuter jet that had just taken off
collided with a smaller plane Monday evening, killing the two
people aboard the smaller aircraft, authorities said.
   The pilot of the Atlantic Southeast Airlines jet, a
Brazilian-made Embraer, returned safely to Gadsden Municipal
Airport with his four passengers.
   The collision occurred around 6 p.m. shortly after the jet left
the northeastern Alabama airport for Atlanta, said Arlene Salac, a
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman in Atlanta. The jet and
the single-engine Cessna 182 collided at an altitude of 2,100 feet
and about three miles southwest of the airport.
   The two Civil Air Patrol pilots aboard the Cessna were killed,
said airport manager Fred Anderton. There were no injuries aboard
the commuter jet, whose tail was damaged in the crash.
   ``It looks like the ASA was flying out of Gadsden and was only
up to 2,100 feet when this little Cessna ... must have came in out
of the blue,'' Ms. Salac said.
   ``It sounded like a cannon shot when it hit,'' said Bob Cote of
Counce, Tenn., a passenger in the commuter jet. ``They never saw
the small plane.''
   On Nov. 5, four people died when two planes collided about 300
feet above the Gadsden airport, which does not have a control tower.
   Gadsden is about 50 miles northeast of Birmingham.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Compares Lithuania To Lincoln's Battle Against
Secession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official is comparing Moscow's
opposition to Lithuanian independence to Abraham Lincoln's fight to
prevent the South from seceding.
   Yuri A. Reshteov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
department for international humanitarian cooperation and human
rights, told a news conference he visited Washington's Lincoln
Memorial on Sunday.
   The Civil War president, ``in his second inaugural address in
1865, said that he is fighting against the forces which are seeking
to dissolve the Union. Abraham Lincoln saved the American Union,''
Reshteov said Monday.
   ``We have been together with Lithuania, with Estonia and with
Latvia for many, many years,'' he said. ``I still hope that what
unites us is much stronger than what is capable of leading to
dissolution of our union.''
   Reshteov said Lithuania's fate should be decided by a popular
vote, rather than by the March 11 declaration by the parliament in
Vilnius rejecting the 1940 Soviet annexation.
   Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., charge d'affaires of the Lithuanian
legation in Washington, responded at a separate news conference
that since the Western Powers have never recognized the Soviet
annexation of Lithuania ``the international law that should be
applied is that the Soviets should withdraw.''
   A majority of Lithuanians favor independence, Lozoraitis said,
but a referendum would be ``a trap'' for neighboring Estonia and
Latvia, where sizable minorities oppose independence.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Auto Parts Firm to Pay $1.5 Million OSHA Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia auto parts manufacturer has
agreed to pay a $1.5 million fine for violating government noise
standards on the job, the Labor Department says.
   The settlement between the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Budd Co., announced Monday, also requires
the firm to improve record-keeping and protect employees from
excessive noise.
   Last December, OSHA proposed Budd Co. be fined $3.3 million for
more than 840 alleged violations at its Philadelphia plant,
including failure to tell some workers that tests showed their
hearing was deteriorating.
   Government regulatory agencies frequently reduce proposed fines
after negotiating with alleged violators.
   Budd, which makes doors, lift gates and other body stampings for
motor vehicles, has about 2,400 people working at the plant. The
Troy, Mich.-based company is a subsidiary of the West Germany's
Thyssen Industries and has plants in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
   Under the settlement, the company will monitor noise and test
employees to identify all workers exposed above a certain noise
level. The workers will be notified of the results and trained to
use hearing protectors, the Labor Department said.
   In addition, the company has agreed to reduce noise at its
Philadelphia plant through engineering controls and repair and
maintenance of equipment.

<HEAD>Petroleum Industry Adopts Environmental Goals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trade association representing the
nation's major oil companies has adopted a set of ``guiding
environmental principles,'' but an environmentalist says they sound
like hollow promises.
   The American Petroleum Institute's board of directors, which
includes all of the nation's major petroleum companies, adopted the
environmental principles Friday in Dallas.
   The principles, unveiled Monday, include pledges that the
industry would promote the safe use, transportation and disposal of
raw materials; address problems created by the handling and
disposal of hazardous substances from oil operations; and operate
plants and facilities in a way that protects the environment and
the safety and health of employees and the public.
   ``The commitments are so vague as to be practically
meaningless,'' said Bob Adler, senior attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council, said Monday. ``It sounds like hollow
promises, especially coming from an industry that has violated not
only government regulations but its own promises time and time
again.''
   Adler said the industry appears to be seeking to replace ``badly
needed'' enforceable government regulations with more unenforceable
industry promises.

champion of civil rights, has died after a long bout with cancer.
He was 76.
   The Austin-born author and lecturer, whose objections
effectively ended blacklisting in the entertainment industry, died
Monday at his Austin home, said his niece, Anne McAffee.
   Faulk was a popular CBS radio and television personality when,
in 1957, he mounted a six-year legal battle in a New York court
against an organization that tried to brand him a subversive.
   He recounted the struggle in a best-selling book, ``Fear on
Trial.'' The book was made into a made-for-TV movie that was
broadcast on CBS in 1975.
   Faulk often said he never expected the First Amendment to become
pivotal in his life.
   ``I never had the slightest inkling that I would ever be
embattled in invoking its protections,'' he said. ``It's the main
nerve center of our entire self-governing democratic society.''
   Faulk studied and taught at the University of Texas before
joining the merchant marine during World War II. He also worked for
the American Red Cross in the Middle East. Despite eye trouble, he
was able to join the Army in 1944.
   While on Christmas leave in 1945, Faulk was approached by
executives from CBS, who had heard him perform and were impressed
with his character sketches and interpretations of folk humor.
   The network signed him in 1946 to do a weekly, one-hour radio
show. He worked for CBS until 1957, when he was fired after AWARE
Inc., a group that blacklisted entertainment personalities, accused
him the year before of having subversive associations.
   Faulk sued AWARE in 1956, charging the group had libeled him and
destroyed his career. He won the lawsuit and was awarded $3.5
million, but the judgment was later reduced to $725,000 on appeal.
   The 1962 trial brought an end to blacklisting. Faulk returned to
Austin, where as a lecturer and writer he earned a reputation as a
champion of individual rights.
   ``He got very strong support from his whole family,'' Ms.
McAffee said of the trial days. ``We all understood how important
it was to put an end to the blacklisting. The family has always
been very political.''
   Journalist Eric Sevareid has said, ``John Henry Faulk will
occupy a niche in the permanent history of American journalism and
in the life and times of the First Amendment. His story illustrates
the First Amendment.''
   Faulk wrote a second book, ``The Uncensored John Henry Faulk,''
which was published in 1985.
   In 1988, Faulk received the James Madison First Amendment Award
from the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas and was
appointed the first holder of the John Seigenthaler Chair for First
Amendment Studies at Middle Tennessee State University.
   Faulk is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, John Henry
Faulk III and Frank Dobie Faulk; three daughters, Evelyn Faulk,
Johanna Faulk and Cynthia Faulk Ryland; a brother, two sisters and
three grandchildren.
   Elizabeth Faulk said a private funeral service will be held
Wednesday. She said a public memorial service was planned for the
weekend beginning April 20 at University Methodist Church in Austin.

   A complete overhaul failed to revive the
sagging late-night fortunes of ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak,
whose CBS talk show goes around for the final time next week.
   The one-hour time slot at 11:30 p.m. will be replaced after the
April 16 show with reruns of other programs until fall, when
original programming will be introduced, Rod Perth, the CBS vice
president of late-night programs, said Monday.
   The 15-month-old show, long rumored to be heading for
cancellation, has been at the bottom of late-night talk show
ratings for most of its short life. In February, the network gave
the show a new look to try to boost the number of viewers. A new
set and a new format only produced the same old ratings.
   Sajak, who gained national fame as host of the popular
syndicated ``Wheel of Fortune'' game show, will have no further
projects with the network, said spokeswoman Susan Tick.
   Sajak was out of the country on vacation and unavailable for
comment, she said.
   ``The Pat Sajak Show'' marked CBS' first foray into the
late-night talk show market since 1972, when Merv Griffin left
after losing the Nielsen battle with NBC's top-rated ``The Tonight
Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   Against Carson, ``Nightline'' on ABC and ``The Arsenio Hall
Show,'' Sajak never consistently captured ratings.
   In its debut week in January 1989, curious viewers made the
Sajak show No. 1 in its time slot. Two months later, the show was
in last.
   CBS' attempt to revive the program two months ago included
making Sajak abandon trading jokes with his band leader, a la
Carson and Doc Severinsen; and instead of walking out to huge
applause, like most talk show hosts, Sajak began opening his
program seated in a chair, simply talking to the audience.
   The transformation didn't work. ``There was no long-term,
appreciable difference'' in ratings, said Tick.
   She said the network will be make an announcement in the next
couple of days about the fall replacement.

   Due to ``amazingly poor inoculation
work,'' animal diseases have killed thousands of pigs, buffalo and
cattle in northern Vietnam, a Hanoi Radio reports.
   More than 13,800 hogs were killed in January and February by
diseases such as pasteurellosis, swine erysipelas and swine
cholera, said the report, which was broadcast on Saturday and seen
today.
   Large losses of buffalo and cattle were also reported over wide
areas of northern Vietnam.
   The radio quoted the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department
as blaming the epidemics on ``amazingly poor inoculation work in
1989,'' but provided no other details.
   The department has urged all its branches to provide solid
guidance to farmers for spring inoculation so as to immunize
domestic animals before the upcoming rainy season, the radio said.

   A U.S. military team flew to Vietnam

missing in action from the Vietnam War, a U.S. embassy spokesman
said.
   After a short ceremony at Hanoi's international airport, the

   The United States currently lists 2,303 MIAS, or missing in

   Cooperation to resolve the issue has increased between the two
countries despite the lack of diplomatic ties and bitterness left
over from the long, bloody conflict.
   Joint U.S.-Vietnamese teams have conducted MIA searches in both
Laos and Vietnam. The Hanoi-backed government in Cambodia has also
offered assistance but Washington, which shuns that government, has
not responded.

<HEAD>Poll: Consumers Favor Health Warnings on Liquor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A majority of consumers favor health warnings on
alcoholic beverages and four out of 10 would support a ban on
advertisements that promote alcohol, a nationwide poll shows.
   The Gallup Poll, released Monday, was commissioned by
Advertising Age magazine and conducted April 5, two days after
federal legislation was introduced proposing that health warnings
be displayed on all alcoholic beverages and ads.
   Seventy-three percent of those surveyed support health warnings.
Only 13 percent said they oppose the warnings.
   Forty-two percent of those polled also favor an outright ban on
alcoholic beverage advertising. Only 49 percent said they were
opposed to banning all beer, wine and liquor advertising. The rest
were unsure.
   Six out of 10 said they believed putting warning labels on
alcohol would have some effect on America's consumption of wine,
liquor and beer. Thirty-six percent said it would have no effect.
   Thirty-eight percent of those questioned said they drink alcohol
either frequently or occasionally, but sixty-two percent said they
rarely or never drink.
   Support for the warnings is highest among those who said they
rarely drink (79 percent) or never drink (76 percent) and lower
among those who said they drink frequently (64 percent).
   The legislation introduced would require every print and
broadcast ad to carry one of five messages about alcohol's effects,
including its association with birth defects when consumed by
pregnant women.
   Gallup questioned a random sample of 823 adults by telephone.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Exxon said the nation's
worst oil spill was a ``tragic accident'' after the corporation and
a subsidiary pleaded innocent to a five-count federal criminal
indictment.
   Attorneys for Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. entered the
pleas Monday in two separate arraignments before U.S. District
Judge John D. Roberts. Each company has been charged with two
felonies and three misdemeanors.
   The two Feb. 27 indictments stem from the March 24, 1989, spill
of nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil from the
tanker Exxon Valdez, which ran aground and ripped its bottom open
on a charted reef outside shipping lanes in Prince William Sound.
   The oil coated hundreds of miles of coastline and killed
countless fish, birds and other marine life.
   ``We view this as a tragic accident, but an accident,'' Jim
Neal, chief lawyer for Exxon Shipping, said after the arraignment.
``We certainly didn't intend to spill oil.''
   But Exxon is not contending it is being unjustly prosecuted, he
said.
   ``We're not going to say we're being unfairly treated,'' said
Neal. ``We're big boys. We're going to defend ourselves.''
   Federal prosecutors have said Exxon and Exxon Shipping face up
to $700 million in fines and other criminal penalties if convicted.
Exxon reportedly had been negotiating a plea bargain with the
federal government, but Neal said Monday such talks no longer are
under way.
   The charges include violating the federal Clean Water Act by
discharging oil without a permit, killing migratory birds and
willfully employing crew members who were not physically or
mentally competent to operate the huge oil tanker.
   The government's attorney, Charles A. DeMonaco, would not
discuss the case Monday.
   Neal said Exxon hopes the charges do not obscure the fact the
corporation has spent about $2 billion trying to clean up the
spilled oil. ``We stepped up and we took responsibility for it,''
he said.
   The Nashville, Tenn., attorney served as chief counsel to the
Watergate special prosecutor and as a special assistant to former
Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
   Roberts said a jury trial will be automatic, and that the case
probably will be complex and extended. The case has been assigned
to another federal judge in Anchorage. No date was set for the
trial.
   Roberts also said the government's intention to seek fines equal
to double the gross losses from the spill would generate litigation.
   Neal said Exxon would contest such fines.
   More than 160 civil lawsuits are pending against Exxon by the
state of Alaska, environmentalists and private individuals for
unspecified damages.
   The company has said it intends to return to the beaches of
Prince William Sound next month to continue mopping up.
   The criminal case is the second one relating to the Exxon Valdez
spill to go before a judge in Anchorage this year.
   On March 22, a Superior Court jury convicted Exxon Valdez
skipper Joseph Hazelwood of negligent discharge of oil. But he was
acquitted of three other charges, including a felony charge he was
reckless and drunk when the tanker went aground.
   Judge Karl Johnstone sentenced the former skipper to help clean
up Prince William Sound and pay the state $50,000 in restitution.
Hazelwood's lawyers said they will appeal.
   Neal said Monday that Hazelwood's acquittal on most counts would
probably help Exxon's case, but the attorney added, ``That was his
case; this is ours.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up; Stocks down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended sharply higher against the
Japanese yen despite dollar-selling intervention by Japan's central
bank and resulted in a sharp plunge on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 773.25 points, or 2.54
percent, ending the day at 29,624.68. On Monday, the Nikkei index
gained 1,119.15 points, its fourth largest single-day advance ever.
   The dollar closed at 158.15 yen, unchanged from its opening but
1.70 yen higher than Monday's close of 156.45 yen. The currency
ranged between 157.90 yen and 158.40 yen during the day's trading.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's rise followed its overnight
strength in New York, despite concerted dollar-selling intervention
by central banks from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries.
   ``The amount of their intervention was too small to push up the
yen,'' said Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan
Securities Co. He said intervention by foreign central banks was
only a token action to show they were fulfilling their pledges at
the G-7 meeting.
   Last weekend, the G-7 industrial nations, comprising Japan,
Canada, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and West
Germany, agreed to joint intervention to support the falling yen.
   None of the banks sold their own currencies, only the dollar
against the yen, Kanai added.
   The Bank of Japan on Tuesday was seen selling the dollar
actively. The amount was not immediately known. Japan's central
bank does not usually announce its market intervention activities.
   On the stock exchange, traders said the index fell further in
the afternoon as institutional investors, who picked up issues that
had fallen in the recent crash, stepped off to the sidelines
because of uncertainties in the currency and stock markets.
   They said index-linked sellings also accelerated the Nikkei's
afternoon plunge.
   Masayoshi Yano, a trader with Nikko Securities Co., said market
players were largely discouraged by the yen's weakness despite the
coordinated intervention.
   ``Because of the yen's quick plunge, investors were discouraged
and sold back what they had bought the previous day,'' he said.
   Yano blamed the yen's quick downturn on insufficient
dollar-selling by foreign central banks.
   Japan's Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto welcomed the
coordinated intervention Monday by the G-7 nations in overseas
markets.
   Speaking at a Tuesday morning news conference, Hashimoto said
Monday's intervention dismissed pessimistic predictions in the
market and news reports that had said coordinated intervention
would not be forthcoming.
   He said, however, exchange rate levels will have to be watched
with concern.

<HEAD>Singer Sarah Vaughan Eulogized As `Giant That Never Got Too Big'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Sarah Vaughan, whose voice earned her
the nickname ``Divine One,'' was eulogized at her hometown church
as a ``giant that never got too big.''
   Miss Vaughan traced her singing career to the small Baptist
church where her mother coaxed her into joining the choir as a
girl. On Mnday, Miss Vauhgan's mother brought her back to Mount
Zion Baptist Church for her funeral and burial.
   ``A Newark girl comes home, having gone full circle,'' said the
Rev. Granville E. Seward, pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church,
``and what a circle that has been.''
   Miss Vaughan died April 3 of lung cancer at her California home.
She was 66.
   She was remembered Monday as a person who never forgot her
hometown of Newark or Arts High School, her alma mater.
   ``She was a giant that never got too big, a star we could reach
out and touch,'' Newark Mayor Sharpe James said. ``For 50 years
because of Sarah, every boy and girl who attended Arts High School
can dream of doing the impossible.''
   Miss Vaughan wanted her funeral held at Mount Zion, the
neighborhood church where, as an 11-year-old, she joined the choir
at the urging of her mother, Ada Vaughan.
   ``A voice born in heaven is now singing in heaven again, with an
angelic choir,'' Seward said.
   The service was simple, but filled with music, from gospel to
Vaughan's signature jazz and pop tunes, capped by ``Bring In the
Clowns,'' one of her favorites.
   About 500 people jammed into the sanctuary of the 118-year-old
brownstone church for the private funeral.
   Among the mourners were Vaughan's 87-year-old mother and the
singer's daughter, Deborah Paris Vaughan, both of Hidden Hills,
Calif.; singer Anita Baker; and jazzman Billy Eckstine, who is
credited with launching Vaughan's professional career.
   Outside, 500 people stood behind police barricades or pressed
against the brick and wrought-iron church fence as they listened to
the service on a loud speaker.
   Miss Vaughan's body was carried from the church to a cemetery
just outside Newark aboard a 102-year-old, horse-drawn hearse.
   Miss Vaughan's career read like a Hollywood script.
   She began her music studies at 7. Her late father, Asbury, was a
carpenter and a guitar player. Her mother sang in the church choir.
   In 1942, on a dare from a friend, she entered an amateur night
contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Her rendition of ``Body
and Soul'' won the competition and brought her to the attention of
Eckstine and other jazz professionals and her career took off.
   ``She was a voice that was unique,'' Ralph Cooper, producer of
the amateur night show where Miss Vaughan made her debut, told
reporters Monday outside Mount Zion. ``From bebop right up to
opera, she could do it all.''

<HEAD>IRS Boss Says He Shares Taxpayers' Frustrations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Internal Revenue Service is
wishing both taxpayers and his 120,000 employees many happy
returns, but he said he shares the frustrations many people
encounter when filing their taxes
   ``Our job, and I think the biggest challenge of the '90s in the
agency, is to make filing easier,'' IRS commissioner Fred Goldberg
Jr. told reporters Monday before addressing the Economic Club of
Detroit. ``Grab any IRS employee, and they'll tell you the same
thing.''
   Goldberg, 41, head of the agency since July 1989, said current
IRS forms and regulations are more than even he can handle _ and he
has an economics degree from Yale University, worked with a
Washington, D.C., law firm and for nine years with the IRS.
   ``The law is terribly complicated ... it is too complicated for
the American public. They deserve an easier system, and I deserve
an easier system, too,'' said Goldberg, who estimated he spent
three hours gathering information for his 1990 return to present to
a tax preparer.
   With the tax filing deadline less than a week away, Goldberg
said, the IRS is receiving more returns earlier and processing them
faster. He gave much of the credit to electronic filing, in which
tax information is forwarded to the IRS by computer.
   A return filed electronically this week will be processed within
two to three weeks, compared with six to eight weeks for a standard
return done on paper and mailed to the IRS, Goldberg said.
   Errors appear in fewer than 4 percent of electronic returns,
compared with about 15 percent of paper returns, he said.
   The IRS also is doing its part to cut the error rate by giving
more accurate information to taxpayers, Goldberg said. The agency
is giving correct answers to 78 percent of the inquiries it has
received this year, compared with 62 percent last year, he said.
   President Bush's proposed 1991 budget includes additional money
for the IRS to upgrade service and employee training, Goldberg said.
   He said he hoped new training would help employees ``try and
keep a lighter touch ... by doing that, you collect more revenue.''
   But Goldberg said the light touch he envisions must mesh with a
tough but respectful attitude toward collecting delinquent taxes.
   ``We are held accountable for collecting revenues, and I think
we do a good job of it,'' he said. ``There are more than 100
million people out there who do pay their taxes, and I do think
(those) folks are looking to us to go after those who don't.''

   Quayle-bashing comedians don't play in
Peoria, at least not with the vice president's biggest fans: the
Hit the Trail for Quayle Club.
   Dan Quayle is not the fool comedians portray, according to the
club, which has launched a letter-writing campaign to get the vice
president out of late-night punch lines.
   ``They make him out to be some Hoosier stumblebum, but he's no
dummy,'' said Noel Clark, one of 30 members of the club started
this year.
   Ten club members assembled Saturday to draft letters to Johnny
Carson, Jay Leno, Pat Sajak and David Letterman.
   ``We just resent all the jokes bashing our vice president,''
said club founder Dorothy Vallosio. ``They are so mean. And they've
criticized him over and over and over so often that they've got
people believing them. The public is being programmed to think our
vice president is a laughingstock.''
   Charlie Barrett, a spokesman for NBC's ``The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson'' _ which features Leno as guest host _ said
the fan club is overreacting to harmless comedic barbs.
   ``A lot of people in the public eye are lampooned by the
media,'' Barrett said. ``It's meant to entertain, no more than
that.''
   But Quayle spokesman David Beckwith applauded the club's efforts.
   ``If you're doing a good job as vice president, as Dan Quayle
is, you're not going to get a lot of publicity or get on television
a lot,'' Beckwith said. ``It's nice the Hit the Trail for Quayle
Club is doing something about it.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Gombogavin
Ochirbat today declared an end to seven decades of party control
over trade unions, artists and scientists but said the police and
army should stay in party hands.
   He spoke at the opening of an extraordinary party congress
called to reconsider the party's most basic goals and policies in
the face of the challenge from new, reformist opposition parties.
   ``We need new theoretical concepts ... starting with what
socialism is and how it should be applied on Mongolian soil,''
Ochirbat said in an hour-long televised speech to the congress' 926
delegates.
   The Communist Party has indicated it is determined to stay in
power despite the ouster of Communists elsewhere in what had been
the Soviet bloc.
   The collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe inspired
Mongolia's new opposition to hold demonstrations that forced the
ruling party last month to hastily call this week's special
congress.
   The delegates were elected directly by the party's 90,000
members for the first time, and include just 41 members of the
current, 146-member party Central Committee. One of the congress'
chief tasks will be to elect a new Central Committee, which in turn
may oust Ochirbat and the four other members of the party Politburo.
   Ochirbat and the Politburo were appointed only last month when
an opposition hunger strike forced the old party leadership to
resign. Their chances for surviving are not yet clear.
   ``Sluggish reaction to the new situation will amount to
suicide,'' Ochirbat warned the deputies.
   He said the party must end dictatorial control of trade unions,
journalists, artists, scientists and mass organizations such as the
youth league. Many people in these groups already have rebelled
against the party leadership.
   He said the party also will cease making administrative
decisions that should be handled by the government.
   But Ochirbat said the party will keep its cells in the army and
police force, ensuring control of them. He said these cells would
be reformed, but did not give details.
   The new opposition groups had demanded that the army serve the
government, not the ruling party.
   Ochirbat also warned against growing disorder in factories since
the pro-democracy demonstrations began in December. The government
announced last week that industrial production for the first
quarter had fallen from last year due to absenteeism and slacking
off at factories, and blamed it on the new spirit of challenging
authority in all areas.
   However, in an interview with the Japanese television network
NHK that was published in today's party newspaper, Unen, Ochirbat
said he had not lost confidence in the party.
   Asked if he thought it could win legislative elections
tentatively planned for July, he said, ``We think people have
confidence in the party that has led the country to progress over
the past 70 years.''
   The party, which receives $6.6 million from the government each
year, has pledged to become self-financing but its assets still far
exceed those of opposition groups, who fear there cannot be an
equal contest. Some of them lack even offices and telephones.
   In his speech to the congress, Ochirbat reaffirmed the
importance of Mongolia's ties to the Soviet Union, which some
opposition groups say has ruled Mongolia like a colony since it won
independence from China in 1921.
   No opposition protests were expected during the three-day party
congress. The government decreed over the weekend that application
for any demonstration must be submitted a week in advance, and
demonstrations that might disrupt public life will not be permitted.
   The last opposition rally was held Sunday and marked the second
congress of the new Mongolian Democratic Party. Witnesses said
variously that 4,000 to 10,000 people gathered peacefully in

<HEAD>Hospital Workers Back On the Job After Eight Days of Striking</HEAD>

   Nurses, technicians and maintenance workers
at the nation's largest health maintenance organization began
returning to the job today, ending an eight-day walkout.
   ``They will be phased in over a three-day period,'' Kaiser
Permanente spokeswoman Janice Seib said late Monday. ``By the end
of the week we should be operating in a very routine way.''
   Service Workers International Union Local 399 voted 4,118 to
2,595 in favor of the latest contract offer, said union Vice
President David Stilwell. An additional 334 ballots were contested
for various reasons, he said.
   The offer called for 5 percent to 6 percent increases in the
first year and 3 percent to 7 percent increases in the second and
third years to 11,000 union members.
   ``A good number of people felt that it was a victory, that they
had actually stuck together and achieved a better offer,'' Stilwell
said.
   The strike affected seven Kaiser Permanente of Southern
California hospitals and more than 40 clinics operated by the huge
health maintenance organization.
   The workers walked out April 2 after rejecting a contract their
own negotiating team had recommended.
   Union spokesman Tom Ramsay said the negotiators had misread the
depth of the resentment from workers who accepted a three-year wage
freeze in the previous contract.
   Ramsay said the workers' frustrations stemmed in large part from
the wage freeze, in place during a period when they believed Kaiser
was prospering relative to other health care providers. Workloads
for nurses and other workers also increased, Ramsay said.
   Both sides said the latest contract had clarified the exact
raises to be given to certain categories of workers, but would cost
Kaiser about the same: $44 million over three years.
   Ramsay and Ms. Seib said the new contract specifies exactly
which categories of workers will get bigger raises _ up to 6
percent in the first year and 7 percent in subsequent years. The
earlier contract had left Kaiser more leeway in how to implement
those raises.
   The contract also guarantees Martin Luther King Jr. Day off for
employees who reserve it as one of their two floating holidays each
year, Ms. Seib said.
   Top pay for a licensed vocational nurse under the old contract
was $13.01 per hour.
   Kaiser Permanente of Southern California has more than 2 million
members, about 1.5 million of whom live in Los Angeles, Orange and
Ventura counties, the areas affected by the strike.
   The Pasadena-based HMO cut back some services and reduced
patient populations as managers and workers from non-affected
facilities filled in.

<HEAD>Atlanta Big-City Crime Capital for Second Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DICK PETTYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta's designation as the nation's big-city
crime capital for the second consecutive year is a public relations
disaster that could affect the city's bid to host the 1996
Olympics, a pollster said.
   ``This did for the reputation of Atlanta what the Titanic did
for the reputation of ocean liners,'' Claibourne Darden, president
of Darden Research, said Monday.
   According to The Atlanta Constitution, which analyzed FBI
statistics for 1989 that were released Sunday, Atlanta had the
highest number of serious crimes reported per 1,000 population of
any big city _ those with at least 300,000 residents _ during 1989.
   The Atlanta figure was 210 per 1,000. Miami ranked second with
189 per 1,000; Dallas was third with 168 per 1,000.
   The crimes counted include murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft.
   Similar crimes counted in 1988 also ranked Atlanta first,
followed by Fort Worth, Texas, and Dallas.
   The new report also showed Atlanta with a 13 percent increase in
its murder rate as killings rose from 217 to 246, outdistancing an
increase of 7 percent in the South and 4 percent nationwide.
   Neighborhood activists and elected officials said that in spite
of the statistical findings, Atlanta is no more dangerous than any
other metropolitan area.
   ``I've been to New York (and) D.C. _ you just have to be careful
and cautious anywhere you go. I don't think there's any
difference,'' said Louise Watley, chairwoman of the Citywide
Advisory Council on Public Housing.
   Tracey Turner, who organized a neighborhood watch program for
her predominantly white neighborhood on the city's east side, said
people will see the latest statistics ``and say, `Oh my God _ this
is Detroit.' But I don't feel that way. ... I would never dream of
not living in town.''
   But U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat whose district covers most
of the city, said: ``Atlanta's high rate of crime is not anything
to be proud of. We absolutely must do better.''
   A spokesman for Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said Jackson has
moved aggressively to fight crime since he took office in January.
   ``The mayor made fighting drugs and crime the No. 1 issue of his
campaign, and it certainly has been the central issue of his first
three months,'' said Angelo Fuster, Jackson's communications
director.
   The efforts have included temporarily assigning a special detail
to the city's public housing projects, moving some officers from
desk jobs to the street and allowing shotguns to be returned to
some patrol cars.
   He also has called for the addition of at least 500 officers to
the 1,600-officer force over the next three years.
   Atlanta is being considered to host the 1996 Summer Olympics,
along with Toronto; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Melbourne, Australia;
Manchester, England; and Athens, Greece. A decision is expected in
September.
   The crime report will not be helpful, Darden said.
   ``You can put on a tremendous effort ... and then you get
something like this that's totally out of your control, and it
gives the decision-makers an undeniable factor on which to hang
their hats. Decision-makers have to justify their decisions, and
this is a real hat-hanger,'' he said.

<HEAD>American Airlines Sued Over Flight Attendant Weight Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines flight attendants should
not have to fit a ``coffee, tea or me'' image, according to a suit
challenging the company's weight policy.
   The class-action federal lawsuit was filed in U.S. District
Court Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   ``American still wants their flight attendants to appeal to a
male sexist notion of what is sexy,'' commission lawyer Ralph D.H.
Fertig said. ``And that's thin.''
   The lawsuit also alleges the policy discriminates against
attendants who take leaves of absences to give birth or work as
union officers because they are not given time to bring their
weight down after they return.
   Fertig said the policy harks back to the days when airlines used
the image of a ``coffee, tea or me'' stewardess as a marketing tool.
   American's policy, for instance, reads that a ``firm, trim
silhouette, free of bulges, rolls or paunches, is necessary for an
alert, efficient image.''
   Patt Gibbs, a flight attendant for 28 years and a plaintiff in
the suit, was weighed when she returned to work in 1988 after a
four-year leave to serve as president of the Association of
Professional Flight Attendants Union.
   The 5-foot-3 Ms. Gibbs was 154 pounds, 29 pounds over the
maximum allowed for her height. Ms. Gibbs got her weight down and
returned to work, but she said the experience was humiliating.
   ``They said, `That's that. You're too heavy. Lose the weight or
you won't have a job,''' she said.
   The federal lawsuit follows the filing in Texas of a similar
discrimination lawsuit by the union for American's 16,000 flight
attendants.
   Last year, Pan American World Airways ended six years of similar
litigation by raising its weight requirements. Pan Am also agreed
to pay $2.3 million in lost wages to 115 employees unable to work
under its old weight rule.
   American's policy is one of the strictest in the airline
industry.
   The policy is based on a chart that assigns maximum body weights
to the size of the attendant, with more weight allowed for men. A
5-foot-5 man, for instance, can weigh 16 pounds more than a woman
of the same height.
   The policy applies only to male and female flight attendants and
ticket agents. Pilots and baggage handlers are not covered.
   American attorney Maureen F. Moore said the policy is intended
to make flight attendants ``presentable'' to the public, but is not
discriminatory because weight requirements apply to both male and
female attendants.
   She said the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline has attempted to
work out a new agreement with the union that included higher
weights, but that the union was uncooperative.
   ``We have been trying to settle this,'' said Ms. Moore.
   Union officials said that it was the airline, not the union,
that was unwilling to make reasonable changes in the weight policy.

<HEAD>Reports: Troops Sent To Three Cities, Pass To Pakistan Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese troops were sent late last week to three
cities near the far western border with the Soviet Union and
Pakistan to quell Moslem riots, a source said today.
   The disturbances occurred in Kashgar, Hotan and one other city
in the remote southwest section of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, said the source, a Western traveler who had been in the
Xinjiang provincial capital of Urumqi.
   He said the troops were sent to the region on Friday. There were
no details on how many people were involved in the disturbances,
whether the troops were soldiers or security troops or whether
there were any deaths or injuries.
   A Western diplomat who met a Xinjiang official on Monday also
confirmed that rioting had occurred but Chinese officials refused
to confirm or deny the reports.
   An official of the State Minorities Commission in Beijing would
say only that he had heard no reports of trouble. The Foreign
Affairs Office in Urumqi refused to answer questions.
   Efforts to reach Kashgar by phone were not successful.
   The traveler said he was told by people in Urumqi that the
rioting near Kashgar, an ancient bazaar and Silk Road oasis west of
the Taklimakan Desert, apparently was caused by a controversy over
the building of a mosque.
   Chinese authorities have recently ordered a clampdown on
religious functions in Xinjiang, claiming people are using religion
for separatist, anti-government activities.
   The traveler, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he and
other foreigners were not allowed to board a plane Saturday for the
700-mile trip from Urumqi to Kashgar.
   The government of Pakistan was also notified Monday that the
13,120-foot Khunjerab Pass through the Karakorum Mountains south of
Kashgar had been closed due to a landslide. The pass, the main
route between Xinjiang and Pakistan, was to have opened for the
season later this month.
   ``There must be some kind of trouble if they've closed the
pass,'' said one Asian diplomat.
   More than half the 14 million people of the arid, desolate
province are Moslems, including Uygurs, Kazakhs, Tadzhikis, Tartars
and Kirkghiz with ties to the Moslems of Soviet central Asia.
   Ethnic tensions have risen under Communist rule as the Beijing
government moves Han Chinese, the dominant ethnic group of China,
into Xinjiang, threatening to make the Moslems a minority.
   Last May, there were violent Moslem riots in Urumqi over a
Chinese-language book the Moslems said blasphemed their religion.
   Since the outbreak of ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union, Chinese
officials have repeatedly warned of separatist threats in Xinjiang.
Foreign journalists and diplomats have been barred from the
province.
   Xinjiang also borders Tibet, another province where resentment
against Chinese rule has erupted into violence in recent years.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dived today and
the dollar surged against the Japanese yen amid speculation an
agreement on market intervention by leading currency nations was
falling apart.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell 773.25 points, or 2.54
percent, ending the day at 29,624.68. On Monday, the Nikkei index
gained 1,119.15 points in its fourth-largest single-day advance.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 550 million shares
today, down from 800 million on Monday. More than 600 issues fell,
while 255 advanced and 80 remained unchanged.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori attributed the
Nikkei's drop to the yen's downturn, which he said resulted from
insufficient intervention overnight by central banks from the Group
of Seven leading industrialized nations.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said after returning from a
meeting of finance ministers of the G-7 nations in Paris last
weekend they had pledged to intervene in currency markets to
support the falling yen.
   The G-7 is comprised of Japan, Canada, the United States,
Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 158.15 yen, unchanged from its
opening but 1.70 yen higher than Monday's close of 156.45 yen. The
dollar ranged between 157.90 yen and 158.40 yen during the day.
   Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan Securities Co.,
said the overnight intervention was only a token action by the
central banks to show they were fulfilling their pledge at the G-7
meeting.
   The Bank of Japan was seen selling about $200 million this
morning in support of the yen.
   On the stock market, traders said the Japanese currency's fall
prompted investors to sell what they had bought the previous day.
   Nomura's Umemori also attributed the Nikkei's plunge, which
worsened in the afternoon, to a report that participants in the G-7
meeting had warned Japan the yen's weakness could not be corrected
unless Tokyo takes measures other than market intervention.
   In a report from Washington, the Washington Post said: ``Japan
was bluntly warned by its major financial and economic partners at
the Group of Seven meeting in Paris to stabilize its own currency
and stock markets by raising interest rates.''
   It quoted ``an important official'' as saying intervention alone
to prop up the yen will not work without other actions on the
Japanese side.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, however, welcomed
the intervention Monday by the G-7 nations, and said it had
disproved speculation that coordinated intervention would not be
forthcoming.
   Umemori said foreign exchange and interest rate movements would
be key to a stock market recovery.
   Yoshitsugu Hanada, a senior dealer with the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe
Bank, said the dollar was not likely to continue to rise
indefinitely.
   ``The market's demand for the dollar seems to be gradually
decreasing,'' following corporate account settlements at the end of
fiscal 1989 on March 31, he said.
   Hanada said the stock market's instability had also contributed
to the yen's weakness.
   Meanwhile, the price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government
bonds closed at 86.54 points, down from Monday's 86.73. Their yield
rose to 7.245 percent from the previous day's 7.205 percent.

   The dollar rose slightly in calm European trading
today morning but currency dealers predicted little movement for
the rest of the session. Gold prices were little changed.
   ``It's just as quiet as yesterday. There's nothing going on in
dollar-mark (trading) and everyone's looking at the yen,'' said a
trader at a large Frankfurt bank.
   However, one trader in Milan, Italy, said the Group of Seven
meeting last weekend in Paris has left only a limited impression on
the market.
   Finance ministers from the group, which links the United States,
Britain, Canada, West Germany, France, Italy and Japan, concurred
in Paris that the Japanese yen's recent slide could have
undesirable consequences. They agreed to joint intervention to
support the Japanese currency.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar climbed 1.70 yen to a closing 158.15 yen today. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 158.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6925 West German marks, up from 1.6923
   _1.4975 Swiss francs, up from 1.4960
   _5.6828 French francs, up from 5.6805
   _1.9054 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9043
   _1,243.25 Italian lire, up from 1,242.00
   _1.1623 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1615
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6325, compared with $1.6397 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $375.00 a troy ounce,
down from $375.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $375.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $375.50 down from $376.25 late
Monday.
   One bullion dealer in London said the gold market is still
digesting the large amount of bullion that came into the market in
recent weeks. He said he wouldn't be surprised if the price fell a
little more.
   Japanese interest in gold is slumping in tandem with the yen's
decline against the dollar, he said.
   ``It is getting more expensive for them every day,'' he said.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.16 to close at a bid $376.97.
   Silver slipped in London to a bid price of $5.13 a troy ounce,
from Monday's $5.14.

<HEAD>Opposition Invited to Interim Government, Says Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader said today that King
Birendra, having bowed to a popular pro-democracy movement and
promised a multiparty system, has invited his party to take part in
an interim government.
   The Nepali Congress Party's acting president, Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai, said the party also was invited to participate in a
constitution reforms commission and in an inquiry into last week's
government crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, the bloodiest
clash this century in Nepal.
   Witnesses said 200 people were killed Friday when police opened
fire on about 200,000 Nepalese who were marching on the royal
palace in central Katmandu. The government said 10 people died and
107 were injured.
   On Sunday, the Harvard-educated Birendra yielded to opposition
demands and said he was lifting a 29-year-old ban on political
parties.
   ``Today I talked to a minister about the king's proposals, but I
told him we need time before making a decision,'' Bhattarai said.
``After all we have been out of politics for three decades and need
time to reorganize ourselves.'' He refused to identify the Cabinet
minister.
   The Nepali Congress formed Nepal's only government under a
Western-style democracy before it was dismissed by Birendra's
father, King Mahendra, in December 1960 on grounds of corruption
and mismanagement.
   The king has wielded power since, ruling through a largely
rubber-stamp government and a partyless national assembly, the
Rashtriya Panchayat, dominated by his nominees.
   Prime Minister Lokendra Chand told reporters Monday that his
government could be considered an interim government until
elections are held, which would follow the formation of the
constitution reforms commission and its issuance of a report. Chand
gave no dates for either elections or the commission.
   Bhattarai said Chand's claim on the interim government was ``his
view. We don't subscribe to it.'' Bhattarai also said the king did
not elaborate on the new interim government.
   He said he will convey the party's decision to the palace on
Wednesay.
   But, he said, the party's stand remained that the ``existence of
the national assembly is an anachronism.''
   On Monday, a radical left-wing group which supported the
7-week-old democracy movement said that unless the assembly was
dissolved immediately and the constitution changed to take away the
king's absolute powers, a multiparty system was meaningless.
   The group, the United National People's Movement, called the
agreement between the king and the Nepali Congress a ``betrayal to
the people'' and a conspiracy hatched in ``connivance with the
opportunist and compromising elements'' in the movement.
   The nascent pro-democracy movement was led by the Nepali
Congress Party and the United Left Front, a coalition of left-wing
parties. It was not immediately known if the king invited the
leftist coalition to form part of the government. Leaders of the
front were not immediately available for comment.
   Life returned to normal in Katmandu and its two suburbs of Patan
and Bhaktapur today after day-long celebrations Monday over the
opposition victory.
   Shops opened and streets were full of tourists and residents.
Shopkeepers removed shattered glass from windows broken during
Friday's demonstration.
   Birenda, 44, is heir of the Shaha dynasty that has held the
throne since the mid-18th century. Many Nepalese, especially
illiterate farmers who comprise the bulk of this country's 17
million people, view him as the reincarnation of the Hindu god,
Vishnu.

   A judge says his refusal to allow a
woman to use her maiden name without her husband's consent is an
effort to maintain the integrity of the family.
   The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday said it would
challenge the March 8 ruling by Probate Judge Anthony B.
Sciarretta, who denied Lucille Anne Riccitelli's name-change
petition.
   ``The state's continuing hang-up with a woman's right to use her
birth name is nothing short of mind-boggling,'' said Steve Brown,
executive director of the ACLU's Rhode Island affiliate.
   Riccitelli, 41, said she decided to resume using maiden name
after her father died without any sons.
   ``When he died very suddenly I thought it would be a nice thing
for me to do for him,'' she said. She said her sister uses a
hyphenated name.
   When Sciarretta learned Riccitelli was married, he told her to
get her husband's consent. She said that left her feeling ``like a
little girl'' and she refused. Sciarretta then denied the
name-change petition.
   ``Just because I'm married to someone doesn't mean I don't have
any rights as a person,'' she said.
   Her husband, Edward Martin, called it ``patently
discriminatory.'' The couple's two sons, age 20 and 16, use his
surname.
   Sciarretta said he did not recall the particular case, but said
``I've taken a firm policy when there are family situations.''
   The judge said he feels spousal consent is needed ``if there is
to be any integrity in the family unit.'' He said he requires a
wife's consent in cases where a husband wants to change his name.
   ``Are you sure this isn't a time warp you've just put me in?''
asked Leslie Wolfe, executive director of the Center for Women
Policy Studies in Washington. ``This is very 19th Century. It is
old common law where when a man and woman married they became one _
the man.''
   The state Supreme Court ruled in 1979 that a person may use any
name as long as it is consistent and not to evade creditors or
police, said ACLU attorney A. Gregorie Frazier.
   Brown said the ACLU receives similar complaints from other women
but most give up or get their husband's permission.
   ``It is really an insult to women in the state,'' Brown said.
   Riccitelli said that she would pursue the suit, even though
Sciarretta ``spoiled what I wanted to do'' in honoring her father.

   Moslem secessionists shot and killed one
of three hostages they had been holding for four days and dumped
his body outside the city's main fire station, police said.
   The body of L.M. Khera, an industrialist, was found with five
bullet wounds, said Tataji Ganju, a police superintendent.
   Khera was the first civilian killed by the militants who was not
accused of being a poice informer.
   His death raises to 256 the number of people killed in the
Kashmir Valley in the crackdown the government began Jan. 20 on a
Moslem movement for secession from Hindu-majority India.
   The body was found about 1{ hours before a deadline set by the
kidnappers, who had threatened to kill all three hostages if three
jailed militants were not freed.
   Ganju said he did not know why Khera, a Hindu, was killed before
the deadline. He said government troops threw a cordon around the
narrow alleys surrounding the fire station and were conducted
house-to-house searches for the abductors.
   The superintendent said nothing was known about the fate of two
other hostages, the vice chancellor of Kashmir University and his
personal secretary, both of whom are Moslems.
   All three were kidnapped Friday and the government responded by
imposing an around-the-clock curfew and arresting between 300 to
400 people, official sources said.
   Seven people were wounded by soldiers and paramilitary troops
Monday when the militants' supporters defied curfew in two places
in Srinagar, witnesses said.
   Curfews ordering people to stay indoors have been the rule since
the government crackdown began in response to an escalation of
bombings and assassinations by militant Moslem separatists.
   The curfews are periodically lifted for a few hours to allow
people to buy food, conduct business or observe Islamic holidays.
   The unresolved fate of Kashmir dates back to 1947 when Indian
and Moslem Pakistan were partitioned along religious lines. The old
princely state of Kashmir was predominantly Moslem, but its Hindu
ruler opted to join India.
   Today, the Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan
along a disputed frontier and has twice been the cause of war
between the two countries.
   The Indian part of Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in India with
a Moslem majority. Moslems, centered in the northern Kashmir
region, account for 64 percent of the state's 6 million people.
Hindus, mostly in the southern Jammu area, make up 34 percent.
   Nationwide, Hindus form 82 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Moslems comprise 12 percent.

<HEAD>11th World Media Conference Opens in Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Media Conference opened a three-day
symposium today to discuss the impact of political change in the
Soviet Union on global communications.
   About 500 delegates from 60 countries, including more than 40
former heads of state, attended the opening session of the
association founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon to encourage
East-West communication in politics, economics and the environment.
It was the group's first meeting in Moscow.
   Moon said perestroika, the policy of political restructuring
initiated by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, made it possible for
the association to hold its meeting in the Soviet capital for the
first time.
   ``I feel there is no place more appropriate to gather for these
discussions than right here in the Soviet Union,'' said Moon, the
founder of the Unification Church.
   Albert Vlasov, chief of the Soviet news agency, Novosti, which
co-sponsored the conference, told delegates that holding the 11th
annual conference in Moscow could be attributed to the policy of
``new thinking'' that is the focal point of Gorbachev's foreign
policy.
   He said the delegates would have the opportunity to meet with
high-ranking Soviet officials who will bring them up to date on the
progress of perestroika and glasnost, the policy of openness, since
Gorbachev came to power five years ago.
   Among the delegates attending the conference were Arthur A.
Hartman, former U.S. ambassador to Moscow; Joseph Luns, former NATO
secretary-general; Raul Alfonsin, former president of Argentina;
Alfonso Michelsen, former president of Colombia; and Jihan Sadat,
widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   Representatives from the Soviet Union included Andrei Grachev,
deputy director of International Affairs; Vadim Zagladin, adviser
to Gorbachev; economist Abel Aganbegyan; Nikolai Vorontsov,
chairman of the State Committee for Protection of the Environment;
and Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the International Economic
Commission.
   Media representatives included Allen H. Neuharth, founder of USA
Today; Bo Hi Pak, publisher of The Washington Times and president
of the World Media Association; and Arnaud de Borchgrave,
editor-in-chief of The Washington Times.

   The Denver Zoo has decided to stop offering
elephant and camel rides for zoo visitors.
   ``It had all the elements of a freak show, and we did not like
it. We're delighted that it's gone,'' said Rocky Mountain Humane
Society executive director Robin Duxbury.
   ``Those stupid little rides with the animals have no kind of
educational value for children at all,'' Duxbury said Monday. ``If
anything, it gives children the wrong message about wild animals.''
   Directors of the Denver Zoo Foundation decided recently not to
renew a contract with a concessionaire who provided the rides.
   ``Our discussions with the Rocky Mountain Humane Society might
have accelerated the decision,'' said zoo spokesman Tom Peterson.
But he said directors already were concerned about the situation
before the society complained.
   ``I don't want the impression that we knuckled under to the
Rocky Mountain Humane Society,'' he said.
   He said the rides gave the zoo only a very small profit, caused
liability concerns and pushed the boundaries of the zoo philosophy.

<HEAD>Police Search For Bodies And Clues From Blaze On Danish Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYSEKIL, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police picked through burned-out cabins
on the ferry Scandinavian Star today, looking for more victims and
for the origin of the weekend fire that killed up to 200 people on
a trip from Norway to Denmark.
   Investigators, working on the theory of arson, said they found
no evidence yet of the spark that ignited the 20-year-old Danish
ship carrying more than 500 passengers and crew in the North Sea
early Saturday.
   Police had not inspected all parts of the ship and were
painstakingly moving through the hulk searching for clues, said
Roar Onso, district police chief in Lysekil on Sweden's southwest
coast.
   ``We are not going over the whole ship to count bodies,'' he
said by telephone. ``The work is slow. We are going over one part
at a time and finishing that before we move on to the next.''
   Norwegian police today took charge of the investigation of the
fire, which occurred midway through the overnight voyage from Oslo
to Frederikshavn, Denmark.
   The ship's owner has said the blaze was deliberately set because
it was one of two fires that broke out on separate decks.
   Two other ferry fires occurred Monday off the European coast.
   A blaze on the Irish Sea car ferry Norrona with 297 aboard
killed one man and injured 32, and the ship's Irish owner suspected
arson. The French ferry Reine Mathilde had an engine room fire
while off Britain's Isle of Wight and one of 675 aboard died of a
heart attack. The cause was under investigation.
   Police searching the Scandinavian Star have found 140 victims,
but estimates of the casualty toll ranged up to 200 after many
children were discovered among the dead. Children under 7 are not
registered on passenger lists.
   Onso said 109 victims were brought ashore. They were being taken
to Oslo, Norway for identification.
   Officers, shaken by what they had seen, said they found families
who died in their cabins with their arms around each other, and
parents who threw themselves over their children in a desperate
effort to protect them from the poisonous smoke and unendurable
heat.
   News photographers allowed into lounge areas of the 10,500-ton
vessel recorded a devastated scene of black twisted metal, in which
nothing combustible remained.
   A commission of high-level officials from Norway, Sweden and
Denmark was due to start work in Oslo today, and a maritime inquiry
was to open Wednesday in Copenhagen, Denmark.
   The disaster revived warnings by Scandinavian sailors against
what they called the proliferation of ships flying flags of
convenience in Nordic waters which come under less strict safety
controls.
   The Scandinavian Star, bought last month by the Danish-based
Da-No Line from SeaEscape of Miami, was registered in the Bahamas.
It had been working the Norway-Denmark line for one week.
   Portuguese trade unions representing sailors on the Scandinavian
Star charged that some Scandinavians were exploiting the incident
for a campaign to bar foreign-flagged ships from Nordic routes.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine blacks were killed,
including seven in one attack, as violence again erupted throughout
South Africa's troubled Natal province, police reported today.
   About 400 people have died in recent weeks in black factional
fighting, most of it centered in Natal, a southeastern province.
   Police said assailants near Pietermaritzburg placed a barricade
in front of a taxi van carrying 19 people, then opened fire,
killing seven people and wounding three. The police gave no motive
for the attack.
   Elsewhere in Natal, a youth died when officers opened fire with
shotguns to disperse a mob, police said. In a separate attack, a
person was burned to death when a car was set alight.
   Police reported numerous clashes in which they used birdshot,
rubber bullets, tear gas and attack dogs to break up stone-throwing
crowds in Natal and other parts of the country.
   The main combatants in Natal are supporters of the African
National Congress guerrilla movement and Inkatha, a relatively
conservative Zulu organization. The fighting has claimed some 4,000
lives since 1986.
   Police said they did not expect any attacks on whites today
despite the release of a pamphlet that urged blacks to ``kill all
the white racists'' on April 10.
   The pamphlet, which circulated in black townships last week, was
issued under the name of the African National Congress. But Nelson
Mandela, the ANC deputy president, said his organization had
nothing to do with the pamphlet and did not know who was
responsible.
   Similar pamphlets and rumors have appeared in recent years, but
have not resulted in any outbreaks of violence, police said.

<HEAD>Military Says 63 Communist Guerrillas Killed in Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops have killed 63
Communist guerrillas on the central island of Negros since Friday,
when soldiers overran a training camp of the rebel New People's
Army, the military said today.
   Elsewhere, NPA guerrillas in a province southeast of Manila
announced they would release a military officer held captive since
late February after he was found innocent of charges of ``grave
crimes'' against the rebel movement.
   Col. Jose Maria Solquillo, who heads a military task force on
Negros, said 15 rebels were killed when soldiers surprised the
guerrillas Friday at a hilltop camp in Murcia, 310 miles southeast
of Manila.
   Eight guerrillas and a soldier died in a clash in Cadiz, 30
miles to the north, on the same day, Solquillo said.
   Solquillo said a civilian spy led about 60 soldiers to the
``backdoor'' of the rebel training camp, catching some 120 rebels
by surprise.
   Soldiers recovered 32 firearms, rebel documents and NPA
``diplomas'' from the camp in Murcia, he said.
   The diplomas indicated that at least 200 recruits had finished
guerrilla training at the camp by the NPA, which has waged a
21-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state in the Philippines,
Solquillo said.
   Solquillo said villagers around the camp later reported dead
bodies in creeks and ravines, and 40 bodies of guerrillas were
found after a search today.
   He said the additional casualties may have resulted from wounds
suffered on the first day of the fighting or during three attempts
by the rebels to retake the camp.
   Solquillo said military operations have moved to towns
surrounding Murcia.
   In Quezon province, 100 miles southeast of Manila, the NPA's
Apolonio Mendoza Command appealed for a 48-hour cease-fire in the
region to allow the release of Capt. Alberto Reyes.
   In documents received today, the rebels said Reyes had been
cleared of ``grave crimes against the revolutionary movement and
the masses'' but had pleaded guilty to minor charges of extortion
and physical injuries before a ``people's court.''
   Reyes, deputy chief of the Constabulary Highway Patrol Group for
the northeastern Luzon region, was captured Feb. 25 at a rebel
checkpoint in Quezon.
   The rebels said they had decided to release Reyes out of
humanitarian considerations, according to the documents, dated
April 9.

   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis
received a mandate to form a government today after working out a
deal with a small party to clinch a one-vote parliamentary majority.
   Mitsotakis, head of the New Democracy party that won half of
Parliament's seats in an election Sunday, said his government would
be sworn in on Wednesday.
   The party wants to liberalize the inflation-plagued economy,
slash the government deficit and attract foreign investment.
   After a one-hour meeting with President Christos Sartzetakis,
the 71-year-old Mitsotakis told reporters: ``I don't have much to
say. As you know I met with Mr. Sartzetakis who gave me a mandate
to form a government.''
   Miksotakis received the mandate after he assured Sartzetakis
that he controlled 151 of the 300 seats in Parliament after
Sunday's elections. New Democracy won 150 seats in the balloting
then received the support of rightist Costis Stephanopoulos, whose
Renewal Party won one seat.
   Stephanopoulos said Monday he offered the vote of his lone
victorious candidate ``without preconditions'' and that he would
not be a member of the government, which will be an all-New
Democracy Cabinet.
   His support broke an impasse that had gripped Greek politics
since inconclusive elections last June and November.
   Temporary governments since the Socialists were voted out in
June have been largely ineffective in dealing with the economy,
saddled with 17 percent inflation and a $15.6 billion government
deficit.
   A New Democracy victory could also mean Greece will make
long-postponed decisions on a U.S. extradition request for a
Palestinian wanted for the 1982 bombing of an airliner over Hawaii,
and on a new military bases agreement with the United States.
   Mitsotakis has said Greece's defense depends heavily on the four
U.S. military bases, which are to close by November unless a new
agreement is reached. He has also said that he would extradite
Mohammed Rashid, the Palestinian wanted by the United States.
   The Athens Stock Exchange reacted favorably to the conservative
victory. New Democracy has promised to cut government spending,
streamline the public sector and reduce government intervention in
the economy.
   The exchange posted a 14.8 percent overall gain in hectic
trading on Monday and a 6.6 percent gain at the close on Tuesday,
according to the General Index.
   The first task of the newly elected lawmakers, who convene April
23, wil be to elect a President to replace Sartzetakis, whose term
has expired.
   Mitsotakis said he would support veteran statesman Constantine
Caramanlis for president. But the 83-year-old Caramanlis, president
from 1980 to 1985, has not said whether he would agree to the
candidacy.
   It was the fourth time Mitsotakis had led New Democracy into
elections after losing to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or
PASOK, in 1985 and falling short of an absolute majority in last
year's June and November vote.
   Socialist leader Andreas Papandreou, whose PASOK finished second
with 123 seats in Parliament, failed in his bid to become premier
for the third time. He led Greece from 1981 to June 1989 until a
conservative-leftist alliance unseated and indicted him for alleged
corruption while in office. No date has been set for Papandreou's
trial.
   The Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress
finished third with 19 seats losing two seats and the power
broker's role it had hoped to play in an alliance with the
socialists.
   The remaining eight seats went to four independents, two
Greek-Moslems, one environmentalist and the Democratic Renewal
party.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised
radical market-oriented reforms but his top economic adviser says
public resistance must be overcome to push any drastic measures
through Parliament this year.
   A promised economic package is still being drafted and
discussed, Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin said Monday,
offering no specifics on the shape it will take.
   Gorbachev said today he will meet with top advisers Saturday to
agree on the shape of the economic reform, the Soviet news agency
Tass reported.
   The news agency quoted Gorbachev as saying the meeting of his
Presidential Council and the Federation Council should make
difficult but essential decisions on the economy.
   The 16-member Presidential Council advises Gorbachev under the
presidential form of government instituted last month and is seen
as a mechanism to transfer power from the Communist Party to the
government. The Federation Council is an advisory group focusing on
issues relating between Moscow and the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   Gorbachev said the economic steps initially planned for 1992 and
1993 should be taken this year and early next year, Tass reported
without further elaboration.
   On Monday, Abalkin said the measures would accelerate a program
for remolding the economy over five years approved in December by
the Congress of People's Deputies, the full national legislature.
   Abalkin, a top adviser to Gorbachev, said he expected a quick
transition to a market economy would come up against powerful
opposition. ``But we must do it whether we like it or not.''
   The Soviet people must understand that without painful economic
reform ``the country has no future as a highly developed great
power,'' he said.
   ``Unless we go over to the new methods, we will deprive
ourselves and our children of a highly developed and efficient
economy and a powerful country, where people will want to live and
which the people will not be ashamed of,'' Abalkin said.
   In speaking of the measures under consideration, Abalkin
repeatedly dodged specifics, implying key decisions had not yet
been made.
   He said the state must lift controls on prices, but would not
specify which prices would be freed or when.
   He also denied reports that some form of convertible ruble would
be introduced by this summer. He said experts believe the Soviet
market must have something to sell first and it will take years
before the country's currency will be convertible.
   Several officials have said the Soviet Union was considering a
plan to provide a Polish-style ``shock therapy'' for the Soviet
economy, which would boost prices, drastically cut the value of the
ruble and raise unemployment.
   With the economy stalled part way between central planning and a
market system, industrial production fell 1.2 percent in the first
quarter of 1990 compared with the last quarter of 1989.
   The country is beset by serious consumer shortages.
   In November, Gorbachev called for strict and unpopular measures
to revive the faltering economy. He reiterated that pledge last
month when he was given sweeping new executive powers as president.
   Approved reforms to introduce a regulated market economy before
1995 are being speeded up due to ``destabilization of the political
system, development of ethnic and regional conflicts, and deficits
in the consumer goods market,'' Abalkin said.
   But any economic measures must be adopted by the Supreme Soviet,
the standing legislature, before they can take effect.
   ``A speedy transition to a market economy will come up against
powerful opposition,'' Abalkin said. ``We will have to make
sacrifices. ... But there must be a social consensus for that.''
   State Price Committee chief Vyacheslav Senchagov told lawmakers
last week that among the three reform variants under consideration
was the Polish example of a crash transformation to a market
economy.
   Poland hopes to keep the painful adjustment period short _ and
its inflation rate has already fallen drastically from the
triple-digit level of January.

   Herzog, 71, complained of stomach pains Saturday night and was

   Pordes said Herzog was able to take part in celebrations for

   Herzog was among thousands of Israelis who invited Soviet Jewish

   An expelled U.S. diplomat left the capital
today, diplomats said, hours after Iraq ordered him out in
retaliation for the U.S. expulsion of an Iraqi envoy accused in a
murder plot.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified
the American as Zachary White, a second secretary at the U.S.
mission in Baghdad.
   The U.S. Embassy refused to comment on his departure, the latest
in a series of incidents bruising relations between Washington and
Baghdad.
   Iraq on Monday said it was expelling the diplomat in retaliation
for the State Department kicking out an Iraqi diplomat working at
its mission to the United Nations.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Iraq's
decision to expel the U.S. diplomat was ``totally inappropriate.''
   The Iraqi, Hamid Al-Amery, who left the United States Thursday,
was reportedly involved in an assassination plot against two
opponents of the Iraqi government living in California.
   Iraq said Al-Amery's expulsion was unjustified and accused the
United States of launching a smear campaign against Iraq and paving
the way for an Israeli attack.
   In related developments, Senate minority leader Robert Dole of
Kansas said he and five other mostly Republican senators will visit
Baghdad on Thursday. The senators, in Cairo today after visiting
Syria, are also scheduled to visit Jordan and Israel.
   In Washington, the Commerce Department said Monday it has
canceled an aerospace trade mission to Iraq as U.S. lawmakers
prepare sanctions legislation against the Baghdad government.
   Elizabeth Dugan, a Commerce Department spokeswoman, said the
Iraqi leg of the aerospace trade mission was canceled ``in light of
the events of the last couple of weeks.''
   Meanwhile, the Iraqi media continued its criticism of the U.S.
administration over the controversy surrounding an alleged attempt
by Iraq to smuggle nuclear triggering devices from the United
States.
   Shortly after Western authorities unconvered that plot, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein made a speech in which he threatened to
use Iraq's chemical arsenal to hit Israel if attacked.
   Iraq also hanged London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft, accused
of spying for Britain and Israel, despite international appeals for
clemency.
   Iraqi officials, including Saddam, denied that Iraq was involved
in the smuggling plot and said the warning was meant to deter
Israel.
   Al-Thawra, organ of the ruling Baath Party, accused the United
States of exploiting recent changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe to impose its control over the Arab world and undermine Arab
security.
   ``The United States has already started revealing its dubious
policies and intentions to impose its hegemony on the region,
exploiting the Soviet Union's retreat to its internal affairs,'' it
said in a front-page editorial.

<HEAD>Aquino Orders Stricter Security Measures After Escapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino ordered
prison authorities today to implement stricter security measures
following a series of escapes by jailed officers involved in past
coup attempts.
   ``These escapes are outrageous and unacceptable,'' Mrs. Aquino
said. ``We will not tolerate the laxity that resulted in their
occurrence.''
   Also today, a rebel ex-lieutenant colonel who was freed by
fellow rebels during a birthday party for his jail warden said he
is joining his comrades to fight Mrs. Aquino.
   ``Today, I am free again to continue our struggle for the cause
of good government,'' said Billy Bibit, an intelligence officer at
the Bureau of Customs who was charged in a Dec. 1-9 coup attempt
against Mrs. Aquino. His remarks were in a statement given to news
organizations.
   Two days ago, members of the rebel Young Officers' Union staged
a stunning five-minute rescue of Bibit, who allegedly raided the
customs' armory and food stocks during last December's coup attempt.
   Police said about 15 rescuers raided the jail while guards were
drinking to celebrate the birthday of a deputy warden. They earlier
stormed a nearby police station to prevent reinforcements from
arriving.
   The deputy warden and two other guards were arrested and jail
superintendent Maj. Cipriano Herrera was relieved of his post.
   Mrs. Aquino ordered Maj. Gen. Gerardo Protacio, commanding
officer of the Air Force, to personally approve passes for
detainees after at least two officers escaped from a detention
center at Villamor Air Base.
   The military said Air Force Capt. Rogelio Seradoy, a rebel pilot
involved in a Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt, escaped Sunday during a
furlough.
   Air Force spokesman Col. Melchor Rosales said four soldiers were
relieved of their posts today following Seradoy's escape.
   Rosales said Seradoy was able to leave his cell Friday after he
told a prison guard that Lumbera had told him he could go. Seradoy,
found by soldiers Monday night, denied to reporters that he ever
escaped.
   Last week, Air Force authorities announced that former Lt. Col.
Rodolfo Calzado, who was serving a 12-year prison term, never
returned after being permitted a temporary leave from the Villamor

<HEAD>Traditional Jazz Funeral For Trombonist Louis Nelson</HEAD>

   They threw a traditional jazz funeral for
trombonist Louis Nelson, but his friends joked he might not have
liked all those dirges.
   ``It was kind of slow,'' said long-time friend Sue Hall. ``He
liked things a little more upbeat.''
   Nelson, 87, the last survivor of the original Preservation Hall
bands, died last Thursday, 10 days after a hit-and-run car
accident. Friends, family and fellow musicians ``cut him loose''
Monday with a jazz procession through the narrow streets of one of
the city's oldest neighborhoods.
   ``There are not many left of the original pioneers,'' said
George Buck, for whom Nelson recorded in both the United States and
England. ``What's tragic about this was that he was in such good
health.''
   Nelson's last performance, the Saturday before the wreck, was at
the Palm Court Cafe, which Buck and his wife Nina operate in the
New Orleans French Quarter. ``He was playing very strong,'' Buck
said.
   The funeral drew admirers and fans from Switzerland, Germany,
Australia, and Japan.
   Nelson preferred the old-time sweet music, which he played with
sliding melodies, but he could also punch out rough tailgate jazz
with Kid Thomas.
   He was with Kid Thomas when he made his first record in 1949.
And the Thomas band was one of the two in 1961 that opened
Preservation Hall, dedicated to keeping traditional New Orleans
music alive.
   Nelson later played with numerous bands, including those of
George Lewis, Kid Howard and Billie and DeDe Pierce, and had become
an international star, making periodic tours in Europe, South
America and Japan.
   At the time of his death, he was playing two nights a week at
Preservation Hall and was leading The Louis Nelson All Stars at the
Palm Court. His group was booked for a summer tour of Japan _ his
10th to that country.

<HEAD>EPA and DOE Agree on Uranium Plant Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies have agreed to a $1
billion cleanup of the Fernald uranium processing plant, but a
citizens' watchdog group says it will monitor the progress with
skepticism.
   ``Now what I'd like to see is it enforced and adhered to,'' Lisa
Crawford, spokeswoman for Fernald Residents for Environmental
Safety and Health, said Monday. ``I want them accountable to not
violating the law and to not violating any deadlines.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy
signed an agreement Monday to clean up the former uranium
processing plant. The agreement, subject to Justice Department
review, replaces a 1986 pact between the EPA and Energy Department
that was based on outdated information.
   Valdas Adamkus, the EPA's regional administrator in Chicago,
signed the agreement Monday. He said the EPA will use it to ensure
that the Energy Department properly handles the radioactive
contamination at the Feed Materials Production Center, 18 miles
northwest of Cincinnati. The plant processed uranium for the
government's production of nuclear weapons.
   ``U.S. EPA will make sure U.S. DOE cleans up the Fernald
facility in an efficient, complete and timely manner to protect
human health and the environment,'' Adamkus said.
   ``Today's proposed agreement requires U.S. DOE to clean up the
most contaminated areas on an accelerated schedule. It also allows
U.S. DOE the necessary time to investigate all environmental
threats thoroughly and sets a realistically ambitious schedule for
overall cleanup.''
   The agreement makes the EPA administrator the final arbiter of
disputes. The EPA added the Fernald plant in November 1989 to the
agency's national priority list of hazardous-waste sites.
   Investigations for the cleanup will cost at least $80 million.
The Energy Department projects the cleanup costs at $950 million
during the next 12 years.
   ``We don't have a lot of faith and a lot of trust,'' Ms.
Crawford said. ``FRESH is still going to be here. We're going to
hold them accountable.''
   The agreement would require the Energy Department to finish
removing radioactively contaminated ground water from under plant
buildings; collect contaminated storm water runoff from ground
waste pits; contain contaminated water in the off-site Paddy's Run
creek; and stabilize tanks containing radioactive residues from the
government's World War II Manhattan Project, which helped develop
the atomic bomb.
   Radioactive and non-radioactive wastes are stored on the site,
even though the plant's private contractor, Westinghouse Materials
Co. of Ohio, stopped production in spring 1989 to concentrate on
cleanup work.
   Federal investigators have found a variety of safety and
management problems at the 16 major facilities in 12 states
involved in making nuclear weapons, and some have led to production
shutdowns and interruptions.
   The problems include poor training of safety inspectors at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation, near Richland, Wash., and the Savannah
River Site, near Aiken, S.C., inadequate fire protection at
Savannah River and alleged illegal dumping at the Rocky Flats
plant, located 16 miles northwest of Denver.

<HEAD>Unconventional Candidates Running In Northern California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Questions involving property taxes and the
environment are on Bay Area ballots today along with a transsexual
mayoral contender who wants pink lifeboats for residents and a
candidate who faces an arson trial.
   Terri Pohrman, a 37-year-old ex-female impersonator who had a
sex-change operation in 1970, is running for mayor of Yountville, a
conservative Napa Valley town about 40 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
   ``Miss Terri,'' as Pohrman is known, campaigned hard among 1,200
residents of the California Veterans' Home, where they love her
exuberant performances in high heels and sequined cocktail dresses
with plunging necklines.
   Pohrman, a former boutique operator, promises to bring more
levity to the leadership at City Hall. Now working as a traveling
saleswoman, Pohrman has pledged to buy Yountville's 3,200 residents
pink lifeboats to protect them from floods, such as one that left
dozens homeless three years ago when the Napa River overflowed.
   Pohrman says sexuality should not influence her race against
Mayor Pro-tem Carlee Leftwich and former Councilman Aaron Mosley.
They agree, but maintain that their city government experience
gives them an edge.
   San Leandro Mayor David Karp is running against John Vaccaro,
who operates a warehouse surplus supply company and faces retrial
in Santa Barbara on arson charges six days after the election.
   The case involves a 1986 fire that authorities have charged was
an insurance-fraud scheme. A 1987 trial ended with a jury
deadlocked 11-1 for conviction of Vaccaro and a co-defendant.
   In Hayward, voters will decide whether to allow a 1,927-home
development on scenic Walpert Ridge above California State
University at Hayward.
   Environmentalists have lobbied against the Hayward 1990 project,
complaining it will increase traffic congestion and pollution.
Supporters argue the development will help improve the city's image
as a place where people live, not just a jungle of freeways and
thoroughfares.
   Voters in Marin County, Newark, Antioch and Los Gatos will be
asked to raise between $1.7 million and $16 million for their local
public schools through property tax hikes dubbed ``Measure A'' on
all the various local ballots.

   Police arrested a West German tour bus
driver today after seizing 25.9 pounds of heroin hidden in the air
conditioning system of his bus, authorities said.
   The seizure resulted from an anti-drug operation carried out in
cooperation with Dutch and West German police, said a Civil Guard
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities did not identify the 47-year-old driver.
   The Civil Guard spokesman said an international heroin
trafficking ring based in West Germany and Holland has been using
tour buses to smuggle drugs into Spain, particularly during
holidays such as Easter.
   In another development, Civil Guard customs officers at Madrid's
Barajas Airport reported seizing 11.4 pounds of heroin Saturday,
which was found hidden under a panel in the suitcase of a Swiss man
who had arrived on a flight from Zurich. The man's identity was not
made public.

   When a group of Hasidic Jews set fire to bread

and doused the flames.
   The Satmar sect Hasidim, prayer books in hand, protested, but to
no avail.
   John Mulligan, a fire department spokesman, said the
firefighters were right to hose down the burning loaves.
   ``Generally our custom is to permit small fires _ but when they

   Observant Jews burn bread before Passover to symbolize that
their homes are free of prohibited food during the the eight-day

<HEAD>Hostage Release Gives Spark of Hope To British Hostages' Families</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends and relatives of Britons held in Lebanon
welcomed today's release in Beirut of a French woman, her Belgian
boyfriend and their daughter, but doubted it meant their loved ones
will soon be freed.
   Four Britons are believed held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon
_ journalist John McCarthy, retired pilot Jack Mann, and Terry
Waite, the envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Missing teacher
Brian Keenan has Irish and British citizenship.
   ``The release of hostages of any nationality by any group is
always very welcome news,'' said a spokesman for Archbishop Robert
Runcie.
   ``But the captors in this case are quite different to those
holding the British hostages in Lebanon, so their release brings
little direct comfort to the families of the British hostages
beyond the hope that it might loosen up the situation of hostages
in Lebanon generally.''
   The three hostages set free today had been held by Abu Nidal's
radical Palestinian group Fatah-Revolutionary Council. The Britons
are believed to be held by Islamic Jihad, an umbrella organization
for pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in Lebanon.
   John Waite, cousin of Terry Waite, said: ``It's great, and we
are delighted that these three have been freed. It's wonderful and
we send them our love. It's also a great boost that somebody has
been released.''
   He said that because the Britons were held by a different group,
``I don't think it means we are going to see the release of any of
our loved ones as a result of this.''
   ``But I hope that it shows things are cooling down a little and
that people are realizing that hostages have got to be released
because they get nobody anywhere,'' he said.
   Chris Pearson, president of the group Friends of John McCarthy,
said: ``Given the nature of their kidnapping _ that they were taken
by the Abu Nidal group _ it probably has little effect on the
British hostages in Beirut.
   ``I don't think it means the Western hostages in Beirut are any
nearer release. But if the suggestion is that there is a more
hopeful mood in the Lebanon then we would be a little bit
encouraged.''
   Waite was captured while negotiating the release of hostages
with Islamic Jihad in January 1987. McCarthy, a journalist with
London-based Worldwide Television News, and Keenan were seized in
April 1986. Mann was taken hostage last May.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today welcomed a new
international accord committing it to free-market oriented economic
reforms, but pressed the West to loosen its restrictions on
high-technology exports.
   Stepan Sitarian, a deputy premier, praised a document that was
endorsed Monday by the Soviet Union and 34 other nations attending
a major economic conference in the West German capital.
   ``Many of the decisions and recommendations contained in the
Bonn document are in line with our philosophy of perestroika and
have a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the Soviet
Union,'' Sitarian said as the 35-nation Conference on Economic
Cooperation in Europe winded down.
   On Monday, the 35 nations participating at the Bonn conference _
all the European countries except Albania plus the United States
and Canada _ informally endorsed a document committing them to back
private property, free enterprise and multiparty democracy.
   Such a move would have been unthinkable only months ago, but it
was made possible by the wave of democratic and economic reforms
sweeping across Eastern Europe.
   Sitarian also pressed for East-West talks on loosening up the
so-called COCOM restrictions on sales of Western technology to the
East bloc.
   ``COCOM should no longer remain a sacred cow,'' he said.
   ``We propose that East-West consultations begin on rules to
govern the transfer of dual-purpose technology,'' said Sitarian,
referring to technology that can be used for both military and
civilian purposes.
   COCOM stands for the 17-nation Coordinating Committee For
Multilateral Export Controls.
   The COCOM nations are working on proposals for loosening
restrictions on technology sales to reforming Eastern European
countries. However, the United States has indicated it will take a
tougher stand on technology sales to the Soviet Union.
   Sitarian said Moscow considered the Bonn meeting ``a major
milestone'' in the process of intensified East-West cooperation
that began with the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe in 1975.
   He said ``we seek to integrate ourselves into the world economy
in a dynamic fashion and on a large scale'' and added the Soviets
want an ``open type of economy.''
   He also said changes at home and abroad ``bring us closer to a
key objective, namely the convertibility of the ruble,'' but he did
not elaborate.
   Economic experts from the 35 nations have been meeting in Bonn
since March 19 to examine ways of improving East-West cooperation
and helping with the reconstruction of Eastern Europe.
   The Bonn conference ends on Wednesday.

   Two editors active in anti-abortion
groups were fired for violating a small daily newspaper's policy
against employees serving as officers of politically active groups
that receive news coverage.
   ``That's two out of a staff of four reporters, that's half my
staff,'' The Fairfield Ledger's Editor Jan Nierling said today.
   The two were fired Monday after refusing to resign their
positions as secretary and president of the recently formed
Southeast Iowa Pro-lifers, Nierling said.
   ``We take our role as a newspaper very seriously and we believe
that their activities jeopardize our credibility as impartial
observers,'' said Ms. Nierling.
   She said News Editor John Kennedy and People Page Editor Terri
Lambertsen both were given the opportunity to resign their
positions in the anti-abortion group, but refused. Kennedy was
secretary and Lambertsen was president.
   ``They said you can think it over tonight and either get out of
the group or quit your job,'' said Kennedy, an eight-year employee
of the newspaper. ``I said I didn't need to think about it, and
they fired me.''
   Ms. Lambertsen said she was warned March 30 to give up her
anti-abortion activities or risk losing her job.
   The newspaper didn't know about Kennedy's involvement until
Monday, Ms. Nierling said.
   The independently owned paper was established in 1849 in this
southeast Iowa city of about 10,000. It has a daily circulation of
about 5,000.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Legality of FBI Purchase of AIM Leader's Photos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld the
legality of an FBI agent's getting a photo shop to sell him copies
of snapshots taken by American Indian Movement leader Vernon
Bellecourt.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
refused Monday to overturn a lower federal court's ruling that
dismissed the suit.
   C. Peter Erlinder, Bellecourt's attorney, said he plans to ask
the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, or request that the
entire court in the 8th Circuit rehear it.
   The appeals panel ruled that Bellecourt had given up his right
to privacy when he dropped his film off at a shop in Minneapolis
that had a processing machine located next to a glass wall. The
transparent wall allowed anyone to observe the photos briefly as
they were being printed at the F-Stop One Hour Photo Store.
   A clerk at the store agreed to sell a duplicate set of pictures
to an FBI agent who had been trailing Bellecourt. The clerk later
told the Indian leader about the duplicate photos, and Bellecourt
sued the FBI.
   The appeals panel ruled that Bellecourt's use of the F-Stop for
photo processing exposed his photographs to the public sufficiently
to defeat his claim to Fourth Amendment privacy protection.
   ``With this ruling it appears there are a lot of places that
people go to in their everyday lives that now are potential
government information pickup points,'' Erlinder said.
   Bellecourt has charged that the FBI's action was harassment
aimed at him because of his involvement in Central American
politics.
   The photos, Bellecourt said, included pictures taken when he
attended the First Congress of Indian Organizations in Panama City,
Panama, in March 1989. Bellecourt said he feared that the FBI or
CIA would circulate pictures of congress participants who could
later become targets of death squads in Central America.
   Bellecourt said he will appeal the decision. He said he believes
the ruling is a threat to everyone's privacy, and may open the way
for federal agents to seize written material, such as copies being
made at a photocopying shop.
   ``I think it's very dangerous, and must be seen as an erosion of
our Fourth Amendment rights,'' he said.
   The judges on the appeals panel were John R. Gibson, George G.
Fagg and Pasco M. Bowman.

   City police dogs may land in kennels because of a
lawsuit by officers who claim providing free after-hours care for
their four-legged co-workers is a dog's life.
   ``We're looking at other ways to cut costs,'' police spokeswoman
Tina Vicini said Monday. ``There's nothing definite yet.''
   About 70 officers are suing the city for more than $1 million in
back pay they claim they are owed for three years under the Fair
Labor Standards Act for taking care of dogs in their department.
   ``Federal laws are passed for everybody, and the city of Chicago
is not immune,'' said John Dineen, president of the Fraternal Order
of Police, which filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court.
   Since the police dog unit started 29 years ago, the city has
saved money by having the canine officers take their partners home
after a day's work.
   The city provides small backyard kennels and pays for dog food
and the use of police station wagons. But the city does not pay the
officers for the time they spend taking care of the dogs.
   ``I have to walk Rocky, give him baths, brush him and a lot
more,'' said Patrol Officer Walter Tamberlin. ``It comes to about
an hour and a half beyond my regular shifts. We even take care of
them after they've retired.''
   The city maintains the officers have the perquisite of having a
pet without the costs.
   ``The vet bills are paid. Plus they have a watch dog on the
premises. Now, they want to get paid for feeding the dog,'' Miss
Vicini said.
   A similar lawsuit in Detroit was settled by awarding officers 45
minutes of overtime a day, totaling about $4,000 a year, said a
Detroit police spokesman.
   Stephen Feinberg, an attorney for the Chicago officers, said the
city's policy clearly violates the dictates of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, which has applied to municipal employees since 1986.
   ``They are providing a service for the city,'' said Feinberg.
``The city would not be able to kennel the dogs for free.''
   Miss Vicini would not comment about how much the city saves by
having the dogs stay with their handlers.

<HEAD>Plan to Destroy 150,000 Pigs to Combat Swine Plague In Trouble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry farmers blocked highways in four
towns for a second day today to stop officials from destroying
150,000 pigs to combat an outbreak of swine plague.
   The farmers complain that the preventive killing of healthy pigs
will bankrupt them. Officials said the government was considering
suspending enforcement of the order in the four towns to prevent
the removal of the pigs.
   Over the weekend, the government ordered all pigs destroyed
within a half-mile radius around farms that have been hit by the
contagious disease since March 15.
   It promised to refund farmers the full price of the destroyed
pigs but the offer was termed insufficient by farmers who say the
cost to restart from scratch is much higher.
   The measure affects some 200 pig farms in the provinces of West
and East Flanders, in Belgium's Dutch-speaking northern half.
   The government's action has sparked farmer protests from the
beginning. The mayors of farming towns have barred the
transportation of pigs to slaughterhouses, arguing it ``disturbed
the public peace.''
   The Belgian measure affects 150,000 pigs. The European Community
has offered to refund farmers for the voluntary killing of another
380,000 animals in areas beyond those of the Belgian program.
   If fully carried out, the EC eradication program, due to start
on Thursday, will cost an estimated $16.9 million.
   The swine plague started in mid-January and is still running out
of control, officials said.

   A commuter plane with seven people aboard
landed safely at Gadsden Municipal Airport after a collision with a
smaller plane that killed two other people, authorities said.
   The Atlantic Southeast Airlines plane was en route to Atlanta
when the crash with a single-engine Cessna 172 Skyhawk occurred
Monday at an altitude of 2,100 feet, said Arlene Salac, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   The smaller plane, with two Civil Air Patrol pilots aboard,
plunged into a field after the collision, which occurred about
three miles southwest of Gadsden.
   Both pilots died. They were identified as Thomas Frondorf, 59,
of Ashville, and Marvin Charles Moffett, 46, of Southside.
   The tail section of the larger craft, a Brazilian-made Embraer
turbo-prop, was damaged in the collision, but it landed safely,
said Fred Anderton Jr., manager of the airport in this city about
50 miles northeast of Birmingham.
   ``I don't know how he ever got it down. Part of the tail was
torn off,'' Anderton said. ``The pilot, to control an aircraft with
that amount of control surface torn from the aircraft, did a
remarkable job.''
   The turbo-prop had three crew members and four passengers.
   Bob Cote of Counce, Tenn., who was one of the passengers, said
he heard a loud bang. ``It sounded like a cannon shot when it
hit,'' he said.
   Witness Vernon Stephenson of Gadsden said the Cessna was flying
west into the sun when it collided with the ASA plane, which was
traveling east.
   ``It went straight down, spinning,'' Stephenson said.
   Sam Watts, vice president of customer services for ASA, said the
names of commuter line's crew members were being withheld during an
investigation of the collision.
   On Nov. 5, four people died when two planes collided about 300
feet above the intersecting runways at the Gadsden airport, which
does not have a control tower.

<HEAD>Report Urges Radical Action to Avoid Near Standstill of Air Travel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing congestion could bring air travel in
Western Europe to a ``near standstill'' within the next 10 years
unless air space management is radically reorganized, a report
released today warned.
   The congestion has already caused serious problems, said the
report, which was prepared for the International Air Transport
Association, or IATA. One out of every four flights was delayed by
more than 15 minutes last year, costing the industry about $5
billion for additional fuel and other expenses, it said.
   With European air traffic expected to double to 500 million
passengers by the year 2000 and to triple by 2010, present capacity
of the transport system ``will be unable to cope with increases in
air travel past 1995,'' it said.
   The report, which has been sent to all governments concerned, is
based on a one-year study conducted by IATA and compiled by SRI
International, the U.S. based consulting firm.
   ``Of the three major airport areas _ London, Frankfurt, and
Paris _ only Paris has excess capacity,'' it said. ``No solution is
seen for Frankfurt's capacity shortfall. Passenger growth at the
three London area airports will exceed terminal capacity by the
mid-1990's, and aircraft movement will exceed runway capacity by
the year 2004.''
   Without enhancement, 16 West European airports `` will be unable
to accommodate air traffic demand in the year 2000, according to a
summary of runway capacities included in the report.
   In the order of seriousness, those airports include Madrid,
Frankfurt, London-Gatwick, London-Heathrow, Barcelona,
Milan-Linate, Duesseldorf, Dublin, Stockholm, Athens, Palma de
Mallorca, Geneva, Manchester, Marseille, Copenhagen and Hamburg.
   The report said by implementing potential improvements most
airports could meet the demand forecast. But it stressed that this
would require overcoming ``political, environmental and financial
obstacles.''
   IATA Director General Guenter Eser, who presented the report,
agreed at a news conference that fighting environmental concerns
will be an uphill battle. Commenting on the airspace situation, the
report said one of the most serious problems is the increasing
complexity of an air traffic control system that has to cope with a
steadily increasing number of aircraft.
   It also pointed to the fast growing numer of airway
intersections and called for the creation of new routes to minimize
such crossing traffic.
   The necessary drastic restructuring should include sectors
reserved up top now for military use, the report stressed.
   ``A radical reorganization of the way in which West European
airspace is urgent and essential if the region's air transport
system is not to be brought to a near standstill in the late 1990's
because of congestion,'' it summed up.
   It called for an early international conference of all
governments, airlines and international aviation organizations,
including IATA, which groups 190 airlines, including all of the
world's major carriers.
   Such a conference, the report said, should ``discuss ways and
means of tackling the problem before it is too late.''
   Eser said the recent political changes in Eastern Europe and the
resulting improved East-West relations would make the carriers gain
``a lot'' of additiona airspace. He noted that almost the entire
area along the border between East and West Germany is closed to
commercial traffic.
   Norman Jackson, head of IATA's technical division, said that in
contacts with military air control authorities during the past 18
months ``we have seen quite an effort on their part ... to help us.
We have had access to military air space to which we had no access
before.''

   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis today
appealed to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev not to carry out
threatened political and economic measures against his
independence-minded Baltic republic.
   Gorbachev seemed to soften his stance today, saying he would
impose direct presidential rule in Lithuania only as an extreme
measure and that a political solution was still being sought.
   The statements came on the eve of the one-month anniversary of
Lithuania's declaration of independence and one day after Gorbachev
and his Presidential Council warned of unspecified ``political and
economic'' measures if the declaration was not rescinded.
   Lithuania said last week it would not repeal the March 11
declaration as a condition for negotiations with the Kremlin, which
so far has taken limited steps to maintain control over the
republic.
   Landsbergis sent a telegram today to Gorbachev, addressing him
as ``esteemed president.''
   ``We are very concerned that ultra-rightist imperial forces are
compelling you to take a wrong step: to continue the wrongs of the
1940s in the Baltics,'' the telegram continued. ``Do not further
this, please; in the name of peace, justice and concord on Earth,
do not do this.''
   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 along
with the other Baltic republics: Estonia and Latvia, which have
declared their intention to seek independence but are proceeding
more cautiously than Lithuania.
   At a meeting today with delegates to a conference of young
Communists, Gorbachev described the Lithuanian parliament's March
11 action as an ``adventure'' but also said he did not regard the
situation as irreversible, the official Tass news agency reported.
   While he did not rule out the possibility of introducing
presidential rule in the republic, he said he would do so only as
an extreme measure if the situation develops into civil conflict,
Tass reported. He also said Moscow was trying to find a political
solution to the problem.
   Gorbachev has ordered Lithuanians to surrender their firearms
and warned the republic not to form border patrols. Soviet troops
have arrested some Lithuanians who deserted the Red Army and they
have also occupied several public buildings in the republic.
   After a meeting last week between Lithuanian representatives and
a major Gorbachev adviser, Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev,
however, both sides made conciliatory statements.
   But on Sunday, Lithuanians prevented hundreds of Soviet soldiers
from entering a plant that prints pro-independence newspapers.
Pro-Moscow Communists had ordered the plant closed.
   The republic also told its young men who will be called up in
the Soviet draft this spring that it is up to them whether they
want to serve.
   In Moscow, lawmakers opposing Lithuania's independence drive
asked Gorbachev to dissolve the Lithuanian legislature and
reiterated its demand for direct presidential rule over the
republic.
   In Estonia on Monday, leaders said they send draft responses to
Gorbachev's criticism of their bid for independence to legislative
committees for debate, a local journalist said on condition of
anonymity.
   Estonia has said Soviet rule in the republic constitutes
occupation of an independent country. The Baltic stte voted to
re-establish independence after a still-undefined transition
period. Gorbachev has demanded Estonia back down.
   And in Latvia, the new Communist Party chief, Alfreds Rubiks,
asked members not to follow Lithuanians and Estonians by
establishing an independent party.
   At a party congress over the weekend, most delegates voted to
keep party ties with Moscow. The minority wants an independent
Communist Party and moved to establish it this month.
   Anatolijs Gorbunovs, president of Latvia's Parliament said
Monday that he is certain Latvian legislators will vote to secede
from the Soviet Union when they meet next month.

   ``Do you remember what it was like
when you were 5 years old and it was Christmas Eve?'' asked
astronomer Phillippe Crane Jr., explaining why he was so excited to
be at Kennedy Space Center.
   Today was the day when the Hubble Space Telescope was to ride
into space aboard space shuttle Discovery. And Crane of the
European Southern Observatory in Munich, Germany, was one of
hundreds of astronomers who wanted to be here for the big event.
   They were left disappointed, however, when the launch was
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a problem with an
Auxiliary Power Unit.
   Once the telescope goes into orbit, it is expected to
revolutionize astronomy.
   ``It's a mixture of all the emotions _ excitement, nervousness,
belief and disbelief,'' Princeton professor Edward L. Groth III
said Monday.
   Both astronomers, who have been involved with the Hubble project
since 1977, study galaxies.
   ``How did galaxies form? How did we all get here?'' Groth asked.
``There are many competing theories, but no solid observations.
Hubble will put another piece in the puzzle.
   ``When you get the answer to a question you've been asking, you
push back the frontier,'' he said. ``It is going to be very
exciting for us all.''
   Although astronomers expect unexpected discoveries by Hubble,
Crane said, ``I don't think it is going to be as dramatic as
Voyager.''
   Astronomers were astonished by Voyagers' pictures of Saturn,
Neptune, Jupiter and Uranus.
   The telescope, named for the late American astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, will be capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and
with 10 times greater clarity than ground-based observatories.
   ``This is one of those incredible milestones. This is something
that literally hundreds of astronomers have been working on, and
hundreds are waiting for the chance to work on it,'' said NASA
scientist Stephen P. Maran.
   The Hubble is receiving considerable attention from amateurs,
too.
   ``The only thing that compares in public interest that I have
seen in 30 years as an astronomer is Halley's comet,'' Maran said.

   A police officer died today, 10 hours after
he and a partner were shot through a motel wall while chasing a
suspect in a barroom shooting, authorities said.
   Detective Sgt. Gary D. Wilson was the first Duluth police
officer to die in the line of duty since 1966.
   Wilson, 34, died of a gunshot wound to the head this morning at
St. Luke's Hospital, said Police Chief Eli Miletich. The 11-year
veteran also had been shot in the shoulder.
   Sgt. John Hartley, 44, who was shot in the arm and chest in the
Monday night incident, underwent surgery and was in stable
condition at a Duluth hospital, Miletich said.
   Miletich said the suspect, a 47-year-old man from Altoona, Pa.,
who had been in Duluth only a few weeks working as a welder, was
being held in the St. Louis County Jail pending arraignment. He was
treated at a hospital earlier for a gunshot wound to the leg.
   Miletich said Wilson and Hartley were shot while investigating a
shooting that had occurred at a bar earlier in the evening. The
patron wounded at the Midway Bar, 34-year-old Mark Chumich of
Duluth, was hospitalized in stable condition with a chest wound
from a small-caliber handgun.
   The Duluth News-Tribune reported that the suspect had been laid
off from his job at Industrial Welders &amp; Machinists only days
earlier and had become upset over jovial comments by a bar patron.

<HEAD>Coalition Talks On Cabinet Jobs, Including Economics Ministry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parties working to form East Germany's first
non-Communist government haggled today over unfilled Cabinet
positions including economic minister, a key role in how fast the
country shifts to capitalism.
   The dominant conservative alliance favors quickly scrapping the
Communist system and unifying with West Germany as soon as
possible, while the Social Democrats want more-gradual
privatization and cuts in subsidies.
   ``We made a good bit of headway,'' Prime Minister-designate
Lothar de Maiziere told reporters after this morning's negotiating
session.
   The Christian Democratic leader said there were still some
issues to be ironed out but stressed he will present a complete
Cabinet list to Parliament at its next session Thursday.
   On Monday the talks produced a 24-member Cabinet list that would
give 14 seats to de Maiziere's three-party alliance, the leftist
Social Democrats would get seven posts and a smaller liberal
alliance three.
   But only 11 of the seats actually were filled on Monday. Among
those not named was the economics minister, who is to be a
Christian Democrat.
   The division of Cabinet seats came after five days of talks with
the Social Democrats, who finished second to the Christian
Democrats in East Germany's first free elections on March 18.
   The proposed Cabinet brings together the major political parties
and includes a well-known peace activist as defense minister and a
Lutheran pastor as foreign minister.
   Hans-Wilhem Ebeling, the designated minister for economic
cooperation from the German Social Union _ a party in de Maiziere's
alliance _ said negotiators had another night or two of work ahead
before the list was complete.
   The Christian and Social Democrats still must harmonize their
differing views on unification with West Germany _ the top priority
of the new government. At stake for East Germans is how much of the
socialist welfare state will remain once the two countries merge.
   Accustomed to generous food and housing subsidies, East Germans
are unsettled by the probable loss of many state benefits as their
country makes the transition to a market-oriented economy.
   The tough job of hammering out agreement on union of the East
and West German currencies falls to the finance minister. Social
Democrat Walter Romberg, nominated for the job, pledged Monday to
fight for a 1-to-1 conversion of East German marks to West German
marks.
   A West German central bank proposal last month that most
exchanges be made at a 2-to-1 conversion drew angry protests in
East Germany.
   Agreement on the Cabinet is a major hurdle that could finally
put in place a democratic government to replace the Communist
caretaker administration that has been running the country since
last October's pro-democracy revolt.
   Social Democrat leader Markus Meckel was nominated to the
important post of foreign minister, while Rainer Eppelmann, who
leads the Democratic Awakening party that is part of de Maiziere's
alliance, was named defense minister.
   Although de Maiziere's alliance won the most seats in the
400-member Parliament, it is seeking a coalition with the Social
Democrats to ensure the two-thirds majority needed to enact
constitutional changes to allow quick unification with West Germany.

<TEXT>
   A militant Moslem group claimed
responsibility for bombing attacks on two police stations in the
capital today that wounded at least nine policemen.
   The United News of India news agency said the blasts were caused
by timed explosive devices. It said one of the bombs was planted in
a toilet and the other in a trash bin.
   Officials at the capital's police headquarters, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the bombs went off at two police
stations about two miles apart in the western suburbs of New Delhi.
   Responsibility for the explosions was claimed by a previously
unknown Moslem militant group, which is backing the fight for the
secession of the predominantly Moslem northern Kashmir territory
from Hindu-majority India.
   In Srinigar, the largest town in the Kashmir territory,
newspaper offices and reporters received telephone calls from a man
who claimed the bombings were the work of the ``Mujahedeen
Kashmir,'' or Warriors of Kashmir.
   The caller, who spoke in the Kashmiri language, said he was an
``area commander'' of the group but did not give any more details.
   Srinagar has been the focal point for the Moslem secessionist
movement in Kashmir. At least 256 people have been killed in
Kashmir since the government cracked down on the insurgency on Jan.
20.
   More than a dozen militant groups are believed to operate in the
region, but government sources said they had not previously known
of the Mujahedeen Kashmir.

   All five cars and the engine went off the tracks outside
Skoldinge, 60 miles southwest of Stockholm.
   The train was traveling from Vasteras to Mjolby, 120 miles to
the southwest. The speed limit in the area was 25 mph because of
rail work, but authorities were unsure why it derailed, duty
officer Sixten Golden said.
   The accident blocked both tracks on the major western railway
from Stockholm to Goteborg, causing severe delays of city trains.
   The identity of the dead passenger was not immediately

   Fire swept through an oil and chemical
company today, sending a huge plume of smoke toward downtown
Milwaukee that closed businesses, schools and a busy freeway.
   No injuries were reported.
   Glendale Fire Chief Norman Wichman said the fire at Harrison Oil
Inc. began near some cardboard boxes in a stock area shortly after
4 a.m. and spread rapidly to a part of the building where tanks of
oil, kerosene and pesticides were stored.
   Firefighters were unable to control the flames, which at
midmorning spread from the plant to an area of brush and railroad
tracks.
   ``We've abandoned the building and are concentrating entirely on
containing the fire in the area surrounding,'' said Wichman. ``We
don't have enough firefighters or water power to keep the fire
down.''
   Plant Manager Gil Dombek said the building held 50,000 to
100,000 gallons of outboard motor oil and 2,000 to 3,000 gallons of
kerosene. About 30,000 gallons of the oil burned, he said.
   He said 150 gallons of a cattle insecticide were believed to
have burned and could have produced toxic fumes.
   ``But beyond that, really, there shouldn't be that much toxic in
there,'' Dombek said.
   Wichman said toxic fumes were not a major concern at the fire
scene. But police evacuated a large neighborhood south of the fire
where the black smoke was spreading.
   ``We've been advised should the fumes descend to the ground,
they're extremely toxic, and we've been told by the Fire Department
to evacuate any area nearby where the smoke may travel,'' Milwaukee
Police Sgt. Thomas Doehling said.
   The plant is bounded on the south by a residential section of
Milwaukee, on the west by Interstate 43 and on the north and east
by industrial areas.
   Three blocks of homes were evacuated. Officials also closed a
high school and the Koss Corp., a large manufacturer of stereo
headphones. Other smaller businesses closed voluntarily.
   Dombek said most of Harrison Oil's business involved packaging
bulk oil into plastic containers and cans and selling it to
outboard motor users. He said it also sold some farm insecticides
and kerosene.
   He identified the burning pesticide as Ddvpvapona.
   Vapona is a brand-name insecticide with an active ingredient
known as DDVP, a spokeswoman for the National Pesticide
Telecommunications Network in Lubbock, Texas, said.
   She said Vapona may give off hydrogen chloride gas when burned.
Hydrogen chloride gas is corrosive, has a suffocating pungent odor
and may cause irritation to the throat, but lower concentrations
are not harmful, according to the spokeswoman, who would not give
her name.

   Gov. George Mickelson told an
interviewer he learned of a Nov. 28 incident at the governor's
mansion from his son. The governor had kept mum for months about
the incident, listed on a Nov. 30 Pierre police log as a rape.
   In an interview broadcast Monday night on television station
KELO, Mickelson was asked how he first learned that something had
happened Nov. 28.
   ``My son told me,'' Mickelson said.
   ``Before it came through on the police report?'' interviewer
Steve Hemmingsen asked.
   ``Yes,'' the governor replied.
   However, Mickelson said through his press aide today that he
misunderstood Hemmingsen's question when the interview was tapedin principle
announced last Friday by Chicago-based UAL.
   The formalization of the buyout pact sets into motion the
process for United's three employee unions to approve wage cuts and
other contract concessions designed to save $2 billion over five
years as a contribution toward the buyout.
   Under the agreement reached Friday, UAL's 71,000 employees will
buy 100 percent of the company by exchanging for each share of UAL
stock $155 in cash, $35 in UAL notes and one share in Covia Corp.
valued at $11.
   Covia is the UAL subsidiary that owns United's 50 percent
interest in the Apollo computerized reservations system.
   The deal, valued at $201 a share, could take up to eight months
to complete. The agreement gives the employees four months to
secure financing and another four months to complete the deal.
   UAL's stock was down 25 cents at $160.75 in early trading today
on the New York Stock Exchange.

   All new foreign housemaids must take a test for
AIDS before going to work in Singapore, the Labor Ministry said
Tuesday.
   Work permits will not be issued to maids who are found to be
infected with the AIDS virus. The test does not apply to other
foreign workers or maids already employed here.
   About 190,000 foreigners work in Singapore. Some 40,000 are
maids.
   Ten people have died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome
and at least 34 others have the virus that causes the disease.
   AIDS damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.

   Sandalwood smugglers in southern India
shot and killed four policemen and wounded five others who were
investigating reports that a gang was pilfering the fragrant trees,
United News of India reported Tuesday.
   The victims were members of an eight-man police party
investigating reports of smugglers in the Hogenakkal forest on the
border of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states, about 180 miles west of
Madras, the news agency said.
   The policemen were attacked Monday night.
   Sandalwood oil is used for incense at Hindu shrines and for
commercial purposes, such as scented soaps. Shavings of wood are
fashioned into fragrant garlands and draped around the statues of
gods and goddesses, and pieces of the wood are used in funeral
pyres.
   There are bans limiting the number of trees that can be cut,
resulting in a thriving smuggling trade.

   Three assailants shot their way into a
car on a mail train, killing a postal employee and escaping with
$2.9 million in Austria's biggest mail train robbery, police said
Tuesday.
   The attack took place late Monday aboard a regional train en
route from St. Poelten to Vienna, a distance of about 40 miles.
   According to witnesses, one of four postal employees on the
train was shot to death. The others were handcuffed and gagged,
with empty mail bags pulled over their heads.
   The robbers slashed open mail bags containing some 35 million
schillings, or $2.9 million, in cash, police said. They fled when
the train stopped in a suburb before Vienna.
   It was unclear when or how they boarded the train.

   Police discovered 22.4
pounds of cocaine that had apparently sat under a kitchen sink for
more than a year while the family that lived in the apartment was
in jail.
   National police said Tuesday the seizure was the biggest drug
haul ever in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, in the Canary Islands off
northwest Africa. It was valued at $4.65 million.
   The cocaine was found recently in a specially sealed compartment
below a kitchen sink, police said. The family that owned the
apartment used its wood-export and video rental businesses as
fronts for selling drugs.
   The three family members _ a 62-year-old Spaniard, his
47-year-old Colombian wife, and their 20-year-old son _ were
arrested in December 1988 and convicted of possession of 4.4 pounds
of cocaine. They are serving nine-year prison sentences.
   Police said a follow-up investigation into the family businesses
indicated they had stashed more cocaine in their apartment, which
prompted another search.

<HEAD>Reopening of U.S. Cultural Center Postponed Amid Anti-U.S.
Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials have indefinitely
postponed the reopening of a U.S. cultural center in the southern
city of Kwangju at the request of the South Korean government, news
reports said Tuesday.
   U.S. officials had said the Kwangju facility would reopen at a
new location Friday, nearly a year after a wave of firebomb attacks
forced it to close.
   Radicals have attacked the center about 30 times since a civil
uprising in the city in 1980. City residents accused the United
States of allowing South Korean troops under U.S. command to
suppress the uprising, in which officials say 200 people died.
   ``The Korean government has reportedly expressed views that it
was undesirable to reopen the center a month before the 10th
anniversary of the Kwangju protests on May 18,'' the South Korean
news agency Yonhap said.
   It quoted an official at the center as saying U.S. officials in
Seoul had decided to postpone the reopening.
   Radical student leaders Tuesday announced a campaign aimed at
permanently closing the cultural center. About 500 students fought
police with firebombs while trying to march off a campus in Kwangju
and vowing to drive out ``U.S. imperialists,'' Yonhap said.
   In Seoul, about 200 students armed with hundreds of firebombs
battled police at Sogang University, shouting anti-U.S. and
anti-government slogans. The students demanded U.S. Ambassador
Donald Gregg be expelled.
   Six students armed with homemade bombs and clubs attacked
Gregg's residence in October. Gregg escaped unhurt.
   Meanwhile, in Itaewon, an entertainment district near the U.S.
military headquarters in Seoul, four Korean citizens were injured
in clashes Tuesday with two U.S. soldiers.
   No details were immediately available, but sporadic clashes have
erupted in the area between U.S. soldiers and Koreans in recent
years.
   U.S. authorities said two U.S. military policemen and a civilian
American employee were injured Sunday in a dispute with Koreans.
South Korean police said six Koreans were injured.
   Police said the Sunday incident occurred when the American
employee injured two Korean pedestrians with his car. Police
claimed the U.S. soldiers, brandishing truncheons, came to help the
American, drawing dozens of onlookers and leading to a group fight.

Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela will lead an
11-member African National Congress delegation in groundbreaking
talks next month with the government on ending white-minority rule,
the organization said Tuesday.
   Following the May 2-4 talks, Mandela will embark on a series of
foreign trips to at least nine countries, including the United
States, the Soviet Union and several African and European nations,
the ANC said.
   Next month's discussions are designed to clear the way for
formal negotiations on a new constitution that will give the
28-million black majority a share of power in the country.
   ``It is vital that this meeting achieve the necessary results in
terms of removing the obstacles that continue to stand in the way
of negotiations,'' the ANC said in a statement from its exile
headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   The ANC has said those obstacles include lifting the state of
emergency, allowing exiles to return to South Africa, and releasing
anti-apartheid activists convicted of politically motivated crimes.
   The government, which had previously announced the dates for the
talks, has made clear that several black opposition groups in
addition to the ANC will be invited to take part in the formal
negotiations on a new constitution.
   The ANC, founded in 1912, has never held formal negotiations
with the white-minority government, although Mandela has met with
President F.W. de Klerk and his predecessor, P.W. Botha.
   The talks originally were set for April 11, but the ANC called
off that meeting to protest a March 26 police shooting that left at
least 11 protesters dead in Sebokeng, a township south of
Johannesburg.
   The ANC delegation will include leaders from inside the country,
such as Walter Sisulu and Ahmed Kathrada. They were released last
year after more than 26 years in prison.
   Exile leaders named to take part in the talks include ANC
Secretary-General Alfred Nzo; the commander of the ANC's military
wing, Joe Modise; and the director of international affairs, Thabo
Mbeki.
   The ANC did not release the exact dates of Mandela's trips.
However, they will begin after the discussions with the government
and last until early July.
   In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, Mandela
is scheduled to visit France, West Germany, Canada, Egypt, Angola,
Nigeria and Algeria.
   De Klerk released Mandela in February after the black
nationalist leader spent 27 years in prison for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the government. Mandela was named deputy
president of the ANC after his release.
   Also in February, de Klerk legalized the ANC and more than 60
other black opposition groups as part of his effort to launch
negotiations.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups want a one-person,
one-vote democracy. De Klerk has opposed this, saying it will
replace white domination with black domination.
   De Klerk envisions a mechanism that would allow whites to
maintain veto power on major policy decisions.

   Federal agents on patrol along the
U.S.-Mexican border followed a trail of footprints to a trailer
where they arrested three men and confiscated 1{ tons of cocaine,
authorities said.
   The seizure occurred Monday near Naco, about 100 miles southeast
of Tucson, Border Patrol spokeswoman Jacqui Parker said.
   Four Border Patrol officers followed footprints to a car and
trailer about a quarter-mile north of the border and seven miles
west of the crossing at Naco, Chief Patrol Agent Ronald J. Dowdy
said.
   When the officers saw people carrying bags across the border and
loading them into the trailer, they staked out the trailer for two
hours before moving in for the arrests, according to Gerald B.
Murphy, who is in charge of the Drug Enforcement Adminstration's
Tucson operations.
   ``It's very common for them to stash the drugs somewhere on this
side of the border _ in a pickup or a camper, or just burying it _
and come back to pick it up later,'' Dowdy said.
   The agents confiscated 3,192 pounds of cocaine, officials said.
   Ms. Parker said investigators did not know where the cocaine
came from or for whom the men were working. The case was turned
over to DEA officials who said an investigation was continuing, Ms.
Parker said.
   She said two of the arrested men were carrying assault rifles,
while the third had a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.
   The suspects were identified as Richard J. Dadd of Sierra Vista,
Ariz., and two Mexicans, Javier Gonzales Herrera and Jorge
Escalante Gamez, of Cananea, Sonora. A fourth person, described
only as a juvenile, was arrested later on charges related to the
seizure and released.
   The seizure was one of several in southern Arizona in the past
week. Other busts netted more than 470 pounds of cocaine and about
4,500 pounds of marijuana and led to arrests of three U.S.
citizens, seven Mexicans and one Yugoslavian.

<TEXT>
   Voters cast ballots today in a runoff
election for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination after a
bruising campaign of name-calling and charges of drug use.
   But in their final campaign stops, Attorney General Jim Mattox
and state Treasurer Ann Richards on Monday talked about party unity.
   ``We are all going to be unified in November, and we are going
to seize the governor's mansion back,'' Ms. Richards said in San
Antonio on Monday.
   Mattox told backers in Dallas that he would consider including
Ms. Richards in his administration. ``I think that there's a place
for all of us within this Democratic Party, each of our talents,''
he said.
   Morning voter turnout was heavy at some southern Texas precincts
and light to moderate in a few larger counties that lacked hot
local races, Mark Toohey of the secretary of state's office said.
   State election officials predicted a turnout Tuesday of 1
million to 1.1 million voters for both parties.
   ``Statewide, we had 2.3 million voting in the primary March
13,'' said Toohey. ``Usually the dropoff or fall off the primary to
the runoff is 50 percent or more and the figures now are tracking
that.''
   The winner of the runoff between Mattox and Ms. Richards will
face Republican oilman-rancher Clayton Williams in the general
election. Williams won the GOP nomination outright last month,
capturing more than 61 percent of the vote.
   Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, is retiring.
   The bitter Democratic campaign raged over the last month after
Mattox, 46, and Ms. Richards, 56, bested a seven-person primary
field.
   Mattox has accused Ms. Richards of using illegal drugs. ``I'm
saying that she used cocaine at the age of 46 and marijuana, and
she used other drugs,'' he said, while refusing to offer evidence.
   Ms. Richards underwent treatment for alcoholism in 1980 and said
she has not had a ``mood-altering chemical'' since. She denied
seeking treatment for cocaine use, adding, ``Mr. Mattox is telling
lies in this campaign.''
   But much of Monday's campaigning _ whirlwind tours of the state
by both candidates _ lacked the nastiness that permeated both
campaigns in recent days.
   Ms. Richards in Midland called for improvements in education,
criticizing Clements for failing to provide leadership to change
the current system for financing public schools. The system was
declared unconstitutional by the Texas Supreme Court.
   Mattox, meanwhile, told members of Dallas' Progressive Voters
League that a state lottery is the only way to raise needed state
revenue without an additional tax increase.

<HEAD>Up To 500 Dead In Famine-Hit Northern Afghanistan</HEAD>

   As many as 500 people starved to
death last month in northwestern Afghanistan because of famine
caused by war, weather, and locusts, Western diplomats said Tuesday.
   Humanitarian aid workers based in the border city of Peshawar,
Pakistan, began issuing famine warnings late last year. One
agricultural expert, Tom Morrison, said the situation is so bad it
might not be possible to save those who remain in the stricken
areas of Herat, Badghis, and Faryab provinces.
   The infestation of locusts and other pests is ``very, very
severe indeed,'' said Morrison, director of Agrisystems nordic AB
Sweden, a Swedish agricultural research firm.
   ``It is so serious that I think the only way to cure it is for
everyone to leave and starve it out,'' he said.
   A Western diplomat who refused to be identified quoted refugee
sources as saying as many as 500 people may have died of hunger in
Faryab province and that hundreds of families have fled because of
a shortage of food.
   About 3.5 million Afghans have gone to Pakistan to escape the
civil war since 1979, when Soviet soldiers intervened in
Afghanistan to help the government fight Moslem insurgents. Another
2 million fled to Iran.
   Aid workers expect most people in search of food will go to
Iran, because Pakistan is several weeks walks away from the
northern provinces.
   The famine has been blamed on several things:
   _The 11-year-old civil war. Farmers either joined the
U.S.-backed rebel fighters or were conscripted into the army.
   _Pesticide spraying, which has been suspended because most of
the countryside is controlled by rebel fighters. According to
Morrison's firm, the government has 800 tons of pesticides but has
released only 300 tons.
   _Inadequately prepared humanitarian aid groups.
   _Late spring frost.
   _Government, which has used nomad tribesman to buy up grain from
the Upper Herat Valley and horde it in Kabul. In addition, hundreds
of thousands of tons of donated grain have either been siphoned by
the government for distribution in Kabul, or taken by rebel
fighters.
   A big problem is that aid workers will not venture into the
isolated towns where residents are starving, said Bruce Wannell, a
British national and researcher who is employed by a variety of
groups on a contract basis.
   He said a $1.2 billion U.N. relief program to aid Afghans can
boast only ``paper successes.''
   ``They have no people on the ground who know the area, who have
real linguistic skilles,'' he said. ``They take blind assurances
that everything is working well and being distributed. But even the
people in the cities are going hungry.''
   A U.N. worker who asked not to be identified agreed, saying the
United Nations is incapable of dealing with the ``rawness'' of
Afghanistan, ``where there are no organizations to implement its
programs.''
   Wannell, who speaks the local Persian language, returned to
Pakistan in early March after several months interviewing peasants,
farmers, Moslem rebel fighters and pro-government militia.
   The people hit hardest by the famine are in villages surrounded
by jagged rocks and accessible only by horse or mule, said Wannell.
   Aid groups are reluctant to venture into areas where they cannot
drive, he said.
   ``A farmer in a small village in Herat recalled an afternoon in
the spring of 1972 when he had to bury 70 people who had died of
hunger, and he said things are worse now,'' said Wannell.

   Men are catching up, at least in numbers. The
Census Bureau said Tuesday that the number of men grew faster than
the number of women in the '80s, something that hasn't happened
since the first decade of this century.
   Death rates for men declined more rapidly than for women,
extending male lifespans and allowing their population to increase
more rapidly than women, the new study disclosed.
   Cancer deaths increased among women while dropping for men,
pointing to increased smoking by women beginning in the 1960s as a
likely factor in the change, a Census expert said.
   ``The male population outgrew the female population in every age
group under age 85,'' Frederick W. Hollmann of the Census Bureau
reported.
   From 1980 to 1989 the number of men in the nation increased by
10,557,000, while the female population grew 10,448,000, the Bureau
reported.
   Even so, women continue to outnumber men in America, 127 million
to 121 million, the report showed.
   The last decade in which the number of men increased faster than
women was 1900-1910, the Census Bureau noted.
   The balance of population is determined not only by the number
of people born but by the number of years they remain alive,
explained Hollmann in a telephone interview.
   More male babies are born than females, he pointed out, but
``generally a sort of equilibrium is reached since males don't live
as long as females.''
   The higher death rate for men means that although they outnumber
women at birth, women surpass men in total numbers later on.
   One consequence of males increasing faster than females in the
1980s was that in 1989 there were more men than women at each age
group below 34. In 1980 men had been more numerous only through age
26, Hollmann reported.
   Hollmann said a major contributor to the males outpacing females
in the 1980s was the change in death rates.
   ``Male life expectency has continued to improve gradually during
the decade. Female life expectency has improved very little since
1982.''
   Life expectency for men increased from 70.9 in 1982 to 71.5
years in 1987, an improvement of six-tenths of a year, he noted.
During the same time period life expectency for women went up only
one-tenth of a year, from 78.2 to 78.3.
   The reason seems to be changing patterns of disease as more and
more women took up smoking and moved into traditionally
male-dominated jobs and lifestyles, Hollmann commented.
   ``You could suggest that a lot of women took up smoking back in
the 1960s, so the difference between men and women in smoking
behavior tended to converge somewhat, said Hollmann. ``If behavior
(between the sexes) is converging, then you have to expect
mortality rates to converge also.''
   ``There is a time lag between the time someone takes up smoking
and the time they come to highest risk of death,'' he said,
accounting for the change in comparative death rates in the 1980s.
   Between 1982 and 1986, for example, the cancer death rate for
males declined from 164.8 deaths per 100,000 men to 163.6. For
women the rate increased from 109.5 to 111.4.
   For heart disease, the death rate for men declined from 264.4
per 100,000 to 238.2. Women had a smaller decline, from 132.5 to
124.6.
   And deaths from cerebrovascular disease fell from 39.2 to 33.5
per 100,000 men from 1982 to 1986, while for women the drop was
from 33.2 to 29.0, also a smaller decline than for men.
   The Census study used mortality data from the National Center
for Health Statistics, a division of the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   While the study did not include a breakdown by sex for
immigration, Hollmann said that was also a contributing factor to
the increase in males. Refugees coming into the country tended to
include more males than females during the 1980s, he said.

   Some residents were happy, others grumpy
about Dopey's rise to the top at the new Walt Disney Co.
headquarters.
   Disney officials on Monday unveiled giant statues of the Seven
Dwarfs, made to look as if they are holding up the roof of the
five-story building.
   Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful and Doc each stand
19 feet tall. They'd been kept under wraps for more than three
months.
   Within hours, tourists began stopping to take pictures of the
dwarfs, who starred with Snow White in the 1937 animated classic.
   ``We have Stone Mountain but these are cuter,'' said Diane Ward,
28, a Georgia native who stopped to look with her 12-year-old
nephew as they made their way to visit the NBC Studios.
   Some gazers were a bit puzzled.
   ``How can you call it a dwarf if it's 20 feet tall?'' asked
Randy Garhan, 41, as he sat in the Pago Pago Club across the street.
   Disney employees were enthusiastic.
   ``What other company could do that?'' said Glen Means, 42, who
works in the molding shop. ``I think it's outstanding.''
   Others were less animated by it all.
   ``The Seven Dwarfs seem to be the only ones amused about this
architectural nightmare,'' said Michael Scandiffio, a board member
of the Burbank Rancho Homeowners Association. ``The building is too
massive, it's an overbearing presence on surrounding neighbors.''

   The new ABC series, ``H.E.L.P.,'' which has
gotten no help from its ratings, will be taken off the air after
April 14 and replaced with a new Los Angeles police series, ABC
said Tuesday.
   ABC said that ``H.E.L.P.,'' about a New York emergency unit of
police and firefighters, will return to the schedule later this
year. It premiered on March 3.
   Its Saturday night successor is ``Sunset Beat,'' which ABC says
is about undercover Los Angeles policemen disguised as
motorcyclists ``in the seemingly safe, yet dangerous and seductive
city that includes Hollywood.''

   The state and federal governments were
on the verge of putting the Tooth Fairy out of business, until
Michigan's dentists came to the rescue.
   The problem was the Environmental Protection Agency had listed
extracted teeth as medical waste to be pulverized and sterilized,
not stuck under a pillow so the Tooth Fairy could replace it with
money.
   But the Michigan Dental Association and dentists successfully
argued that teeth should be excluded from the state's own hazardous
medical waste list, and the EPA went along.
   A Plainwell dentist, Dr. Robert Tisch, brought the problem to
the attention of state Sen. Jack Welborn.
   ``I said, `Do you guys realize you're outlawing the Tooth
Fairy?''' Tisch said.
   Dentists across the state joined the protest.
   The dentists had more than the potential disappointment of their
young patients to back them up, though.
   William Burke, assistant executive director of the dental
association, explained that dental schools need teeth for study.
Because fluoride has cut the number of cavities youngsters get,
schools have a hard time obtaining decayed teeth, he explained.
   Michigan opted out of a two-year EPA pilot program to track
medical wastes and adopted its own package, which does not include
teeth.
   The EPA, before adopting its final rules as to what constitutes
hazardous medical waste, also decided to drop teeth from the list.
   ``There aren't too many things we can save in the Legislature,
but thank God we can save the Tooth Fairy,'' Welborn said.

   There is no indication how dogs will
react, but Albertville plans to place a nickel-plated fire hydrant
on a granite slab in front of the Chamber of Commerce office
Wednesday.
   It's the millionth hydrant to come off the Mueller Co.'s
assembly line since the plant opened in the northern Alabama city
15 years ago.
   City Council has proclaimed Albertville the ``Fire Hydrant
Capital of the World.''
   ``When you consider how many fire hydrants there are, the fact
that more than 40 percent of all the hydrants being installed today
come from this small Alabama city is quite remarkable,'' said Lloyd
Darnell, the plant manager.
   Albertville has about 20,000 people.
   Mueller's annual payroll is $11.5 million. It turns out more
than 400 hydrants a day, destined for points in much of the world.
   Darnell reckons he knows just about everything there is to know
about fire hydrants except one thing: ``I never figured out why
dogs like them.''

   Fire that roared through a house trailer
early this morning killed six children ranging in age from 9 months
to 12 years in this rural town about 30 miles southwest of New
Orleans.
   Another fire in Delaware killed five family members.
   In the trailer, ``one body was found in the hallway leading to
the bathroom, one in the kitchen and four were in a bedroom,'' said
Detective Paul Lirette, of the Lafourche Parish Sheriff's
Department. The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Johnell Davis, 34, and Lorianne Davis, 29, escaped from the
trailer with two of their children, Denise, 7, and Justin, the
9-month-old twin brother of one of the children who died.
   Johnell Davis suffered numerous burns, said Lafourche Parish
Chief Deputy Eddie Duet. Mrs. Davis was treated and released and
the children were being examined, he said.
   A burning staircase prevented three children, ages 1 to 4, and
two adults from escaping a fire of undetermined cause this morning
in a townhouse near Glasgow, Del. A fourth child was at school,
said officials, who did not immediately release the family's name.

<HEAD>Likely Effects of Japan's Promised Reform Still Hard to Gauge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the government's promises to make the
economy more accessible to American companies face an uphill fight,
and officials say it is hard to estimate how much the reform will
help trim a huge U.S. trade deficit.
   ``In the long term, it will definitely positively affect our
trade imbalance, but we are not sure of the amount of
improvement,'' said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director of the
America-Oceania Division of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
   In a report last week on U.S.-Japanese negotiations, Japan
promised to spend more money on public works, reform business
practices that limit competition, and change tax laws to make more
commercial land available at lower prices. A final and more
detailed report is due in July.
   The government could run into resistance from the opposition
Socialists, owners of small businesses, and corporate groups that
have cozy relationships.
   ``I don't know how long it will take before the effects begin to
show up,'' said Noriko Hama of Mitsubishi Research Institute.
   ``A lot of political and administrative problems have to be
cleared up. We are just standing at the front door,'' she added.
   In recent years, Japan's sales in the United States have
exceeded U.S. sales in Japan by about $50 billion a year.
   Immediate promises include increased public works spending in
the budget for the fiscal year that began April 1. Under Japanese
law, the governing Liberal Democratic Party's majority in the lower
house of Parliament is enough to ensure it has its way in deciding
the budget.
   They also include an easing of restrictions on opening new
large-scale retail stores, tighter enforcement of anti-monopoly
laws and a close inspection of preferential supply arrangements
among groups of companies.
   Some of the provisions on stores, however, would require
approval by Parliament. Even within the governing party, there is
concern about alienating traditional party supporters among Japan's
1.6 million small retailers.
   ``The large-scale retail stores law and so on involve very
difficult domestic political elements, so I am not so optimistic as
to the prospect of gaining consensus or endorsement from the
congress. As far as the administration is concerned, we are
determined to do whatever we made public,'' said Taizo Watanabe,
the Foreign Ministry's spokesman.
   Local governments also could maintain regulations to protect
smaller retailers from competition by big stores. U.S. officials
say the present law is a barrier to foreign stores and that larger
Japanese stores are more likely to carry foreign products.
   Large retailers have welcomed the proposed changes but have
noted that high land prices, a labor shortage and rising
construction costs could frustrate expansion plans.
   Over the longer term, Japan pledged efforts to solve tax laws
and other regulations that keep some land underutilized and drive
up prices; increase fines for anti-monopoly law violations; look
into simplifying merger and acquisition procedures; and formulate a
10-year plan of increased spending on such things as housing,
sewers, parks, airports and port facilities.
   It also said, however, that year-by-year public works spending
would be decided flexibly to avoid inflation and overheating the
economy.
   The leading opposition party, the Socialist Party, has supported
bigger public works spending but added that ``it must be
concentrated on improving the people's livelihood.'' It also has
favored a greater role for local governments in retail store
regulations.
   Enforcement of the anti-monopoly laws and the new task of
regular checks on Japan's ``keiretsu,'' or corporate groups, would
depend on the Fair Trade Commission, an agency that so far has not
enjoyed high status and has not rushed to prosecute offenders.
   Agency figures for the fiscal years 1984-1988 show no criminal
charges filed. In fiscal 1988, the commission looked into 180
cases, and in only five told companies that they were violating the
law and had to stop.
   Japan pledged that the commission would more actively press
criminal charges and said its fiscal 1990 budget calls for
expanding the number of investigators to 154 from the present 129.
   Meanwhile, it said the commission would take steps against
exclusionary practices uncovered in analyses to be conducted of
keiretsu activities.
   Some Japanese say these groups of companies that hold each
other's stock and supply each other with goods and services
actually are like a major U.S. corporation, such as General Motors,
composed of many divisions.
   U.S. officials and businessmen complain that transactions within
such groups freeze out foreign suppliers, and the groups' structure
makes it hard for foreigners to invest in Japan.
   On the question of dealings based on personal ties, Masahiko
Ishizuka, an editorial writer for the economic newspaper Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, quoted one Japanese executive as saying of his
customers, ``As long as face-to-face relations remain intact,
prices are irrelevant. They will continue to buy from us
irrespective of prices, virtually shutting out newcomers.''

   A court of appeals Tuesday upheld a
life sentence against a Palestinian convicted of terrorist attacks
against Jewish and American interests in Denmark, officials said.
   Marten Imandi was one of four Palestinians convicted of bombing
a synagogue and Northwest Orient Airlines' office in 1985 in
Copenhagen. One person was killed and several people injured.
   Imandi was arrested in Sweden and also convicted of terrorist
attacks in the Netherlands and Sweden.
   Imandi, who was sentenced to life last December, sought a
lessened sentence, arguing that he played a minor role.
   But the Svea Court of Appeals rejected Imandi's version of
events and said, ``This kind of crime is of especially serious
nature.''
   Another defendant who received a life sentence was Mohammed Abu
Talb, who is suspected of complicity in the 1988 explosion of Pan
Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people. He is being investigated by
Scottish police in connection with that incident.

   The Palestinian terrorist group led by
Abu Nidal today freed a French woman, a Belgian man and the
daughter born to them in captivity. The couple had been seized from
a French yacht nearly 2{ years ago.
   Jacqueline Valente, 32, Fernand Houtekins, 43, and 2-year-old
Sophie-Liberte were released by masked gunmen who sped up to the
main gate of the French Embassy in three cars with drawn curtains,
police said.
   ``I embrace all my family. I am well, and the little one also,''
Ms. Valente told French reporters who were given exclusive access
to the three. The family later took off for France in a chartered
executive jet.
   Because the hostages released today were believed to have been
held in Libya, the case is considered unrelated to the 18
Westerners held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
factions.
   Today's release came about a month after France sent to Libya
three Mirage F1 warplanes that Libya purchased in 1986. The sale
had been blocked by the French government as part of an arms
embargo imposed when France aided Chad in fighting against Libya.
There was no public explanation by France for its decision to
release the planes.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Abu Nidal's group was
``distancing'' itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing
the hostages, Libya's official news agency JANA reported today.
   Last week, Gadhafi urged the release of hostages in the Middle
East as a humanitarian gesture for Ramadan, the Islamic holy month.
He singled out Ms. Valente.
   Gadhafi has supported Abu Nidal, who along with some of his
followers has been convicted of terrorist attacks abroad. The
Libyan leader is believed to have allowed him to live near the
Libyan capital, Tripoli.
   Houtekins said today that the four members of his family still
held by the terrorist group were also well.
   ``They have morale. They are holding firm,'' he said, adding,
``We expected our freedom, we knew it was coming one day. The day
of our freedom has arrived. For those who stay behind, we keep
hoping.''
   The two, accompanied by their daughter, refused to discuss
certain other subjects, including the death of their second child
in captivity or their living conditions while they were hostages.
   A police spokesman said French Ambassader Rene Ala ``apparently
had advance notice of the release. Ala was waiting at a cement
outpost manned by French Marine guards near the main gate'' of the
West Beirut compound.
   French Embassy spokesman Francois Abi Saab said the three were
``OK.'' He said Houtekins was ``clean shaven and looked relaxed.''
   Hours after the release, Walid Khaled, spokesman for the
terrorist group, the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, drove to the
French Embassy and said he would release a statement ``after my
talks with French diplomats.''
   The Abu Nidal group announced on Nov. 8, 1987 it had seized
hostages from the French yacht Silco in the Mediterranean off the
Gaza strip. It accused them of collaborating with Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency. Friends said the group was on a holiday cruise.
   The group acknowledged holding Valente, 32, Sophie and five
Belgians: Houtekins, his brother Emmanuel, and Emmanuel's wife and
teen-age daughter and son. A boy born to Ms. Valente in captivity
in March 1989 died shortly after birth, French government sources
said.
   Khaled had said Monday three European hostages would be freed by
the end of Ramadan, about April 26 depending on when the new moon
is sighted. Jan Hollants Van Loocke, a Belgian official, said at
the same news conference he was in Lebanon to negotiate the
Belgians' release.
   He said the Abu Nidal group had linked freedom for the four
other Belgians to the release of Nasser Sa'eed, a Palestinian
jailed in Belgium for a June 1980 grenade attack on Jewish youths
in Antwerp. A 15-year-old was killed in the attack and 20 people
injured. The Belgian government has not yet responded to the offer.
Sa'eed is serving a life term.
   Two other daughters of Ms. Valente were freed after Libyan
intervention on Dec. 29, 1988. Daughter Marie-Laure was 6 at the
time and Virginie was 5. They were returned to their father Pascal
Betille, divorced from Ms. Valente.
   The two girls surfaced in Libya, where the others were believed
held.
   Early today, masked gunmen stood guard in two cars at a nearby
traffic circle as the three cars carrying the hostages approached
the French Embassy.
   ``The gunmen did not disembark. The doors were opened and
Ferdinand Houtekins emerged first, wearing a gray suit and carrying
the baby daughter,'' the police spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Ms. Valente was next. They walked into the embassy
hand-in-hand as about 10 embassy guards, armed with automatic
rifles, watched,'' he said.
   Ms. Valente was wearing a black leather jacket and beige skirt,
while the child was all in white.
   Ala came out of the guard post, shook hands with Houtekins and
Ms. Valente and they walked across the embassy garden to the
offices, the spokesman said.
   A French guard said on condition of anonymity the three were
served ``breakfast of instant coffee, jam and croissants.''
   In France, Jacqueline's mother Brigitte Valente said, ``The
nightmare is over and I'm trembling with joy. I can't even talk.
It's too beautiful.''
   The mother and daughter had a brief conversation broadcast on
French radio.
   France's foreign minister credited Gadhafi with the freeing of
the hostages and expressed satisfaction with the Libyan leader for
this ``noble and humanitarian gesture.''
   ``Its real value will be appreciated in the future of relations
between France and Libya,'' Roland Dumas said. He expressed hope
the remaining four Belgians would be released without delay.
   In Brussels today, Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said he hoped
``the release can be considered as a testimony of good faith
concerning the release of the other'' hostages.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council has been blamed for scores of
terrorist acts, including the December 1985 attacks on Rome and
Vienna airports that killed more than 20 people and the September
1986 attack on an Istanbul synagogue in which 21 worshipers died.
   The Westerners missing in Lebanon are eight Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in west
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Most of the others have been held at least three years.

<HEAD>Communist Party Congress Aims To Reform To Remain In Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party opened a hastily
called congress Tuesday with a call for reform to maintain its
70-year-old grip on power in the face of a growing pro-democracy
movement.
   ``It means a radical transformation of party structure, of its
internal relations, its principles of activity and methods of
work,'' General Secretary Gombojavyn Ochirbat told the 926
delegates.
   ``Sluggish reaction to the new situation will amount to
suicide,'' he said in an hour-long televised speech.
   The congress is expected to last three days, during which
delegates are charged with meeting the challenge from new
opposition groups who have organized massive protests.
   The organizations were inspired by the collapse of Communist
parties in Eastern Europe and reform in the Soviet Union. Mongolia,
which lies between China and the Soviet Union, has long been a
satellite of Moscow.
   The Mongolian Parliament on March 23 abolished the Communist
Party's monopoly on power and approved of elections with more than
one candidate. Elections are tentatively scheduled for July.
   The move followed the Soviet Communist Party's move to give up
its monopoly on power.
   Ochirbat told the congress the time has come to end dictatorial
party control over trade unions, religion, art, science and mass
organizations.
   But he said the police force and army should remain in party
hands.
   Opposition groups have demanded the army serve the government,
not the ruling party.
   Ochirbat also said the party does not want to adopt capitalism,
even though it favors introducing market-style economic reform.
   ``The renovated (party) will ... uphold Marxist-Leninist ideas
end apply Marxist-Leninist methodology,'' he said.
   He also reaffirmed the importance of Mongolia's ties to the
Soviet Union, which some opposition groups say has ruled their
country like a colony since Mongolia won independence from China in
1921.
   The party, formally called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party, responded last month to opposition demonstrations by ousting
General Secretary Jambyn Batmon and four fellow members of the
party's ruling Poliburo.
   The current congress will elect a new Central Committee, which
may again change the Politburo and general secretary. However,
several congress delegates expressed support Tuesday for keeping
the 61-year-old Ochirbat. He has been well-received by the public
because he was out of favor under Mongolia's former dictator,
Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal.
   Some delegates also suggested that most of the current 146
Central Committee members be replaced by younger, better-educated
people.
   Ochirbat said in an interview published Tuesday that he thinks
his party can win legislative elections in July.
   ``We think people have confidence in a party that has led the
country to progress over the past 70 years,'' he said in an
interview with the Japanese television network NHK. It was
published in the Communist party newpaper, Unen. The party, which
receives about $6.6 million from the government each year, has
pledged to become self-financing. But its assets still far exceed
those of the opposition parties, most of which lack even offices
and telephones.
   The government effectively banned opposition protests during the
congress. It decreed over the weekend that applications for any
demonstrations must be submitted a week in advance, and that
demonstrations that might disrupt public life will not be permitted.
   Two newly formed opposition parties _ the Mongolian Democratic
Party and the Social Democratic Party _ blame the Communists for
the nation's economic stagnation and its heavy dependence on Moscow.
   About 50,000 Soviet advisers and 60,000 troops are in Mongolia.
   They say the Soviet Union doesn't pay enough for Mongolia's
natural resources and has saddled the nation of 2 million people
with a debt estimated by Western economists at $6 billion.
   
   The developments in Mongolia have brought the wave of political
reform to the doorstep of China, which crushed its own democracy
movement last spring with the army attack on protesters in Beijing.
   The 3.5 million ethnic Mongols in China's Inner Mongolia are a
potentially receptive audience. They already are exposed to a
potent mix of democratic ideas and Mongol pride via newspapers,
radio broadcasts and even pop music from Mongolia.

   NASA scrubbed the launch of
Discovery with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope today when a
problem developed four minutes before liftoff in a unit that
supplies power to the shuttle's wing and tail surfaces.
   The launch will be attempted again in one to two weeks, said
launch director Bob Sieck. A more precise time was to be determined
Wednesday.
   Sieck said a preliminary review indicated a valve on the
Auxiliary Power Unit did not respond properly, allowing too much
fuel to go through the power system.
   ``We're not sure of the impact yet,'' Sieck said. ``It's going
to take time to sort that out.''
   Engineers were working to determine the extent of the problem
even before the five astronauts emerged from the cockpit where they
had lain on their backs for more than three hours.
   NASA said at an early afternoon briefing that the APU will have
to be removed from the launch vehicle.
   The scrub was a disappointment to the hundreds of astronomers
who had gathered at the Kennedy Space Center to watch the launch of
Discovery and the telescope that it carries in its cargo bay.
   ``It's a real downer. You could see it couldn't be a more
beautiful day,'' said NASA scientist Stephen P. Maran.
   About 150 relatives of Edwin P. Hubble, the astronomer for whom
the telescope is named, headed for a pool party following the scrub.
   ``These things have happened. It's part of the game,'' said
Harvey Hubbell IV, a 60-year-old retired businessman from North
Palm Beach who organized the family gathering. ``We would much
rather you stop the count than do something foolish.''
   The Hubble Space Telescope, the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built, has been waiting to take its place in space
since 1983 _ delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger
explosion.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said the space agency was
disappointed at the latest delay ``but the stars will be here
tomorrow.''
   The space telescope's batteries would have held their charge
through Friday, but after that would have had to undergo an
eight-day recharge on the ground. Once Hubble is in orbit, its
solars panels will keep its batteries supplied with power.
   Two other shuttle launches have been delayed because of
auxiliary power units.
   All the other worries, about weather at the launch site and at
emergency landing sites overseas had been swept away and the
countdown proceeded without a hitch to the four minute mark
pointing toward a launch at 8:47 a.m. EDT.
   But then Commander Loren J. Shriver noticed that one of the APUs
was running erratically and reported the fact to launch control.
   The three APUs steer the ship's three engines, control the
movements of flaps on the wings and the rudder, lower the main and
nose landing gears and provide the hydraulics for the main landing
gear breakes.
   They are partly, but not totally redundant _ that is, each
movable part is governed by two APUs. The pumps are considered so
critical that mission rules require landing as soon as possible if
any one of the three fails.
   The 35th shuttle mission is to take Discovery to an altitude of
380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so that the
telescope can operate safely above Earth's obscuring atmosphere.
   Hubble will be capable during its 15-year working lifetime of
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   It will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant
their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. It
may shed light on how and when the universe was formed, solve the
mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes, even find stars with
planets that could conceivably support life.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it might
release its first telescope image _ of an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina _ as early as four days after Hubble is
deployed.
   ``Never before have we had a telescope, an observatory with this
capability,'' said NASA's chief scientist Lennard Fisk, ``and it
will not be surpassed perhaps until we start to establish
observatories on the moon some day.
   ``So we have an opportunity now to really unlock the secrets of
the universe in ways that have not been available to us before.''
   Shriver's crewmates are Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the
pilot, and mission specialists Steven A. Hawley, Bruce McCandless
II and Kathryn Sullivan.
   About 24 hours after launch, Hawley will lift the 24,250-pound
telescope from the payload bay with the shuttle's 50-foot-long
mechanical arm. The procedure will take more than five hours.
   McCandless and Sullivan, both veteran spacewalkers, will be
dressed in space suits, ready to leave the shuttle cabin in case a
problem arises during deployment.
   Discovery will follow Hubble for its first few days in orbit
until NASA is confident the telescope is functioning properly. The
astronauts then will prepare to end the five-day flight with a
landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   The telescope is expected to start providing scientific data by
satellite in a month or two.
   The excitement attending the launch lured hundreds of
astronomers to Kennedy Space Center as well as many Hubble family
members.
   The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the
universe is expanding. His findings gave rise to the theory that
the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous
explosion known as the big bang. He died in 1953.
   The space telescope may prove that his theory was correct. It
also may put prevailing theories in doubt.
   ``It's the history of science that every time major advances are
made it raises new questions,'' said Charles Pellerin Jr., NASA's
director of astrophysics. ``The most exciting things Hubble will
see are the things I can't predict. That's the fun stuff.''

<HEAD>Former Senator Chiles May Enter Race</HEAD>

   Former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles has
begun voicing interest in running for governor, and that concerns
his fellow Democrat, U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, who so far is the
front-runner on their party's side.
   Nelson, who hoped to unify the party behind himself, talked to
Chiles by telephone and was working out details for a meeting here
Wednesday in hopes of heading off Chiles' potential entry, an aide
said.
   But regardless of Chiles' decision, Nelson will continue his
campaign, spokesman Don Pride said.
   ``He's had his eye on this goal for a couple of years now. He's
not going to take his eyes off of it,'' Pride said. ``We know the
rest would be more difficult, but he'd run the vigorous campaign
that's needed to win the nomination and beat (Republican Gov. Bob)
Martinez.''
   Martinez said that if Chiles enters the race, that's a problem
for the Democrats, not him.
   ``It doesn't impact our campaign. It impacts the Democratic
campaign,'' Martinez said Monday. ``They must sense something wrong
with the party, but I can't say what it is.''
   While Martinez acknowledged that the retired senator is
well-known and respected, he said he would not fear him in a
general election.
   ``I can handle anybody who wants to get on the ballot,'' he said.
   Most polls show Nelson with a slight lead over state Sen. George
Stuart of Orlando in the Sept. 4 Democratic primary, and Nelson has
built a 4-1 advantage in fund raising.
   Chiles said he has talked about getting into the race with
former U.S. Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay as his running mate.
   ``I don't feel I have to do this to save the party or because of
the failure of someone else to do something,'' Chiles told the St.
Petersburg Times. ``It's more an inner thing. I normally try to
listen to the inner voice.''
   Chiles, 60, retired from the U.S. Senate in January 1989 after
18 years, saying he had become frustrated with the slow grind of
federal government. He also underwent heart surgery during his
final term.
   Chiles now is director of the LeRoy Collins Center for Public
Policy at Florida State University.
   MacKay, who narrowly lost to Connie Mack in the 1988 race for
Chiles' seat, confirmed he was considering running with Chiles.
   Former Gov. Claude Kirk, state Sen. Marlene Woodson-Howard and
attorney Anthony Martin are opposing Martinez in the GOP primary.
   A third Democrat, impeached former federal judge Alcee Hastings,
dropped his governor's campaign Tuesday and said he would run for
state secretary of state.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union made a strong pitch
Tuesday for Western help in making free-market reforms by asking
for talks to ease restrictions on the sale of high technology.
   Stepan Sitarian, a deputy Soviet premier, said such Western
limits ``should no longer remain a sacred cow.''
   The premier also hailed a new international accord, reached
Monday in Bonn, that committed the Soviets to backing free-market
economic reform. He said the pact conformed to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform program, known as ``perestroika.''
   ``Many of the decisions and recommendations contained in the
Bonn document are in line with our philosophy of perestroika and
have a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the Soviet
Union,'' Sitarian said in a speech to the 35-nation Conference on
Economic Cooperation in Europe. The conference ends Wednesday.
   Sitarian also made it clear the Soviets hope for Western help in
carrying out economic change. He said success in implementing the
Bonn accord ``will depend on countries meeting each other half
way.''
   Sitarian said the West's so-called COCOM restrictions on
high-technology sales to the East bloc present ``certain
complications'' to restructuring the Soviet economy.
   COCOM stands for the 17-nation Coordinating Committee For
Multilateral Export Controls. The Western COCOM restrictions were
adopted during the Cold War to prevent the Soviet bloc from gaining
sensitive technology.
   ``We believe that few businessmen would be willing to cooperate
in an outdated technical basis,'' Sitarian told reporters after his
speech.
   ``We propose that East-West consultations begin on rules to
govern the transfer of dual-purpose technology,'' he said,
referring to products and equipment that can be used for civilian
or military purposes.
   He said the Soviet Union is willing to agree to inspection
procedures so the West can verify that high-technology equipment is
not being used for military purposes.
   The COCOM nations are already working on proposals for loosening
restrictions on technology sales to reforming East bloc countries.
However, the United States has indicated it will take a tougher
stand toward the Soviet Union.
   Sitarian said the Soviet Union is committed to carrying out
price reforms as soon as possible. He said it is also eager to make
its currency, the ruble, convertible.
   In Monday's pact, the 35 nations at the conference _ the United
States, Canada, and all European countries except Albania _
informally endorsed a document committing them to support private
property, free enterprise and multiparty democracy.
   Such a move would have been unthinkable months ago before the
wave of democratic and economic reform in the East bloc.

<HEAD>Taking Senior Auditors Off Cases May Have Cost IRS $6.5 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service may have lost
$6.5 billion in taxes by taking senior auditors off cases to train
new workers, congressional analysts say.
   A report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, estimated that in cases it had checked the government
lost more than $1 million in taxes for each new worker who
completed a 26-month training course under the tutelage of senior
auditors.
   ``It is clear that the use of experienced revenue agents to
train new agents carries a significant cost in terms of unrealized
audit revenues,'' the General Accounting Office said in its report.
``It is essential that IRS explore alternatives to its present
training program.''
   The IRS had reached much the same conclusion in its own survey
of training procedures, although the agency found a lower revenue
loss than did the GAO. However, the IRS is concerned enough about
the loss that is planning to hire private contractors to conduct
some training in the budget year that will begin Oct. 1.
   Ellen Murphy, IRS director of public affairs, said Tuesday that
the GAO finding has no relevance over the last two years because
the IRS has been under a hiring freeze.
   ``When we resume hiring new people, we will be doing a lot more
of on-line training _ reserving intensive classroom training for
contractors _ ... and having trainees go with experienced auditors
to see how the job should be done,'' she said.
   The $6.1 billion IRS budget that President Bush has proposed for
1991 would allow the agency to hire 2,400 auditors. It now has
about 16,000.
   In the late 1980s, Congress twice voted additional
appropriations to reduce the budget deficit by increasing the
number of auditors. Those appropriations ended Oct. 1, 1988.
   The GAO report projected that it will take up to four years
before tax collections will rise enough to offset the costs of
hiring new agents _ and make up for the revenue lost by having them
trained by senior auditors.
   The GAO study was made at the request of Sen. James Sasser,
D-Tenn. and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. The
investigation was aimed at determining how revenue collections are
affected by hiring more IRS auditors.
   The percentage of individual tax returns that are audited has
been declining steadily for several years, from about 100 per
10,000 last year to an expected 92 per 10,000 this year.
   From July 1, 1986, to Sept. 30, 1988, the hiring period studied
by the GAO, the IRS hired 7,300 people as revenue agents, whose
chief task is to audit complicated returns, including those filed
by large corporations.
   The GAO surveyed five of IRS's 63 district offices _ Atlanta,
Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco _ where 1,103 of the
7,300, or 15 percent, were hired. The GAO found that:
   _Most of the burden of training the new employees fell on the
most experienced and highest-paid revenue agents.
   _Sixty-nine percent of the training assignments were carried out
by agents who had been auditing returns at the time they were
selected.
   _As of last June 30, the use of auditors for training the 1,103
new workers had deprived the government of about $840 million in
revenues that the interrupted audits would have produced. The GAO
said that total could rise to $980 million by the time all the new
employees complete their training.
   If costs were similar in the other 58 districts, the revenue
loss could be in the neighborhood of $6.5 billion.
   _Through June 30, only 179 of the 1,103 new employees had
completed all four phases of training, and the revenue loss was
estimated at more than $1.04 million for each trainee who completed
the course.
   The GAO found that as of June 30, only 848 of the 1,103 new
employees were still with the IRS.
   The IRS conducted its own survey last November and concluded
that it would cost about $527 million in unrealized audit revenue
to train 1,000 new agents.

<HEAD>Founder of Children's Ranch, Who Let Trucks Run Over Him, Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Getting run over by trucks 100 times a
year for charity has taken its toll on Tom Owen, a bodybuilder and
stunt man who founded the King's Ranch homes for children in
Alabama in 1976.
   Owen resigned as director of the Chelsea-based homes for abused
and neglected children, telling his directors in a letter: ``I am
totally exhausted, physically and emotionally.''
   The directors accepted his resignation Monday.
   Owen, 40, suffered two of the most serious injuries in his
career in the last 13 months. In March 1989, he let a pickup loaded
with 20 children run over his stomach while he posed for a National
Enquirer photographer. That stunt sent him to the hospital with
five broken ribs and lung and liver damage.
   In January, he broke a leg while running in Dothan as he trained
to compete in a Mr. America contest.
   Acting director Donny Harwell said Owen's resignation was not
totally unexpected. ``Over the past year or so, after Tom got hurt
badly, he has indicated to members of the board that he's tired,
but this did come rather quickly,'' he said.
   Owen's stunts, including pulling trucks, allowing trucks to roll
over his stomach and lifting five people with his teeth, have been
important fund-raising gimmicks for King's Ranch. ``If it seems
that Tom and the Ranch are synonymous, that's true,'' Harwell said.
   Owen and his wife, Linda, bought a house near Chelsea in 1976
and took in a 13-year-old boy. By 1979 they had 10 children and
were getting calls about others.
   ``It really gave me an obsession that's never quit,'' he said.
``My wife and I have personally raised about two dozen children.''
   King's Ranch operates 20 homes in Alabama, including emergency
youth shelters, a treatment center for ``pre-delinquent'' boys and
a home for unwed pregnant teen-agers. It now serves about 200
children. Its annual budget, about $3 million this year, is funded
through private donations.

   President Bush said today that while ``there's
an awful lot to be done'' to resolve U.S.-Soviet differences on
arms control, he hopes his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will be a catalyst for progress.
   ``It's important that we continue to talk to Mr. Gorbachev,''
Bush told reporters during a flight to Toronto where he was to meet
with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Asked about an apparent stiffening of Soviet positions on arms
control issues, Bush said, ``I'm not disappointed, but I mean,
look, you deal with what's on the table.''
   ``We've got a time frame now,'' he said, ``in which there's an
awful lot to be done so I cannot even predict how much will be done
by the time the summit rolls around.''
   He said the meeting, now set for May 30 through June 3, ``will
serve as a bit of a catalyst or goal for getting things done.''
   Bush's trip to Toronto marked the start of a 10-day round of
consultations with Western leaders about changes in Eastern Europe
and the summit.
   Diplomacy aside, a major intrigue has been over who will throw
out the first pitch tonight at the Toronto SkyDome: Bush, the avid
baseball fan, or Mulroney, the president's host.
   ``Wait and see,'' said Derek H. Burney, the Canadian ambassador
in Washington.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said both leaders
will make the first pitch.
   How is that possible?
   ``It's one of the modern miracles of our unique U.S.-Canadian
relationship that we'll be able to do this,'' Fitzwater said with a
smile.
   Bush's son, George W. Bush, is a part owner of the Rangers,
which finished fourth in the seven-team American League West last
year. The Blue Jays are the defending American League East
champions.
   After meeting with Mulroney, Bush will see British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in Bermuda on Friday and French
President Francois Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla., on April 19.
   Fitzwater said all of the discussions would focus on East-West
issues, the future of NATO, the unification of Germany and Bush's
five-day summit with Gorbachev beginning May 30.
   Fitzwater said plans for the summit would not be spoiled by
snags that cropped up last week in negotiations to cut long-range
nuclear weapons.
   ``We have a lot of things to talk about in our relationship
besides arms control,'' Fitzwater said. ``We are prepared to go
ahead with the summit regardless of what happens on the arms
control part of it.''
   He acknowledged that ``there is certainly a great question'' of
whether an arms agreement will be ready by the time Bush and
Gorbachev meet.
   In accordance with today's emphasis on baseball, all of the
Bush-Mulroney meetings, as well as a dinner, were to take place at
the SkyDome complex, which includes a hotel and shops as well as
the ballpark.
   The trip represents the fifth meeting between Bush and Mulroney
in North America.
   In the past, Canada has complained it was being taken for
granted by the United States, but now appears delighted with the
attention it's receiving from Bush.
   Burney, the Canadian ambassador, said he did not think there
ever has been such ``substantive engagement'' between the United
States and Canada.
   ``The frequency (of meetings) speaks for itself. Obviously, we
think it helps the tone of the relationship as a whole,'' Burney
said.
   He said smooth ties with Washington are important because
Canada's economic health is so closely linked with the United
States.
   Proclaiming U.S.-Canadian relations on a ``very positive
footing,'' Burney said. ``It is a question of access and influence.
   ``And in terms of access and influence, I think Canada is in the
unique position these days in Washington, and whether it is to
preserve and promote our own interest or whether it is with a
broader objective in mind, I think we can turn that, and we are
turning that, to a good end,'' he said.

   A retired postal worker outbid four banks
to loan $110,000 to Genesee County _ the first time in at least 24
years that the county has borrowed money from a private citizen,
officials said.
   John A. Johnson of Castile offered to loan the county the money
for a year at 5.82 percent interest, below the rates the four local
banks would have charged, said County Treasurer Richard E. Siebert.
   ``It's the first time in 16 years that I've been here that an
individual showed up off the street'' to loan money to the county,
Siebert said. County account clerk Gertrude Penepent said Johnson
was the first citizen lender she could recall in 24 years with the
county.
   Siebert said Johnson told him he read about the municipal note
offer in a newsletter put out by a local bank. He said Johnson
could have received a higher interest rate with some other form of
investment but the tax-free status of the note might outweigh that
disadvantage.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said Tuesday
the Indian people should be ``psychologically prepared'' for an
armed conflict with Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir valley.
   Singh made the comment in Parliament hours after Moslem
secessionists in the picturesque valley shot and killed a Hindu
industrialist they had held since Friday.
   Singh told the Lok Sabha, or house of the people, that Pakistan
was fomenting the insurgency in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir
and could ``make a limited intervention with or without uniforms to
achieve its territorial goal.''
   ``You (Pakistan) will not get away with it,'' the prime minister
warned the neighboring country. ``You will have to pay a very heavy
price, and we have the capability to inflict this cost.''
   ``People should be psychologically prepared for any
eventuality,'' he said. ``We cannot remain soft. A soft people and
a hard army are incongruous.''
   The comments were the most aggressive the Indian leader has made
since he took office in December. India and Pakistan have fought
three wars, including two over Kashmir, since both were born out of
the 1947 division of the British-ruled subcontinent.
   They have been exchanging sharp words since the beginning of the
year, when the Moslem movement for secession of Indian Kashmir
escalated. India charges Pakistan with arming and training the
militants. Pakistan denies it.
   State-owned television said Pakistan had raised its civil
defense to an advanced state of preparedness and made plans for
evacuation of civilians from near the border with India.
   It said Pakistani radar installations were moved closer to the
border and camouflage coverings placed over important buildings.
   In Srinagar, the largest city in the Kashmir valley, police said
they found the body of a Hindu industrialist who was kidnapped four
days ago along with two Moslems.
   The body of L.M. Khera was found near the city's fire brigade
headquarters with five bullet wounds, said Tataji Ganju, a police
superintendent.
   His death raises to 257 the number of people killed in the
valley since Jan. 20, when the government crackdown on the Moslem
secessionist movement began.
   The body was found about 1{ hours before the kidnappers' 3 p.m.
deadline to release three of their colleagues.
   Ganju said he had no idea why Khera was killed before the
deadline expired. He said he did not know the fate of the other two
captives.
   At least one person was killed and 12 others injured Tuesday
when government troops opened fire on curfew violators in Srinagar,
witnesses said. The city has been under a continuous curfew since
the three hostages were kidnapped Friday.
   In New Delhi, bombs exploded at two police stations Tuesday,
injuring at least nine policemen, officials said. Responsibility
for the explosions was claimed in Srinagar by a previously unknown
militant group called the ``Mujahedeen Kashmir,'' or warriors of
Kashmir.
   Moslem-dominated Kashmir is a former princely state whose Hindu
ruler opted for union with India at the time of the 1947 division
of the subcontinent.
   Moslem resentment at the move was muted at the time, but the
discontent has flared into an active campaign for secession in
recent months.
   India and Pakistan fought wars over Kashmir in 1948 and 1965. A
U.N.-monitored cease-fire line separates the valley into Indian and
Pakistani sectors.
   The two countries also fought a war in 1971 that led to the
independence of Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
   U.S. participation in an international
development bank for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is now
assured because of limits put on Soviet borrowing, the Treasury
said Tuesday.
   The agreement among 42 countries involved was announced Monday
in Paris, where officials said an accord creating the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development will be signed May 30.
   For three years the Soviet Union will be allowed to borrow only
as much as it pays in, or about $216 million, Treasury spokesman
Robert Levine said.
   The Soviets will contribute 6 percent of the bank's $12 billion
capital, but participating countries will pay in less than a third
of their capital share, with the rest on call. The United States
will have the largest share, 10 percent. The member countries of
the European Economic Community will have 51 percent among them.
   Similar intergovernment banks, like the World Bank, have larger
proportions of their capital on call, but never actually call it
because they get most of their money for loans by borrowing
themselves on financial markets.
   Jacques Attali, an adviser to French President Francois
Mitterrand, said Monday in Paris that a two-day meeting agreed on
58 articles of the bank's statutes, settling such outstanding
issues as the type of currency to be used in the bank, and the
amount and form of capital contributions of each member.
   The delegates agreed that the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and
European Currency Unit all can be used to contribute capital to the
bank. The ECU is worth about $1.20.
   A president for the bank still has to be chosen, and several
European cities are competing to have the headquarters. Officials
hope it can start making loans by the end of this year.
   At the first session to set terms for the bank, in January, the
United States objected to full participation by the Soviet Union
unless Moscow initiated major market reforms.
   In addition to the United States and virtually every European
country, participants in the bank include Japan, Morocco, Israel,
Egypt and South Korea.
   Levine said the bank's charter will also require borrowers to be
moving toward democracy, a requirement the United States wanted and
the Soviets opposed.
   He added that an additional curb on loans to the Soviets will be
a requirement that their borrowings be either for private
enterprises or for enterprises operating competitively and moving
toward a market orientation. That could include some state-owned
enterprises.
   For all borrowers, 60 percent of the loans must go to the
private sector, Levine said. The other 40 percent can be used for
government infrastructure projects -- roads, bridges, water supply,
transport -- or to improve the environment.
   The limit on loans to the Soviets can be changed in three years,
but only by an 85 percent vote of the participating countries.

   Hundreds of people on crutches
and in wheelchairs Tuesday protested political violence in black
townships that disabled them and killed thousands of others in the
past five years.
   ``We bury the dead, but we live with the disabled,'' said
William Rowland, who is blind and was an organizer of the protest.
Demonstrators sang and clapped as they made their way through the
black township of Soweto.
   There were no clenched fist salutes or political slogans.
   ``We are not representing anybody. This is not for victory, but
for peace,'' said Mpumelelo Gamede, 32, whose legs were paralyzed
after he was stabbed in a tribal fight in the southeastern coastal
province of Natal.
   More deaths were reported in Natal on Tuesday. Police said eight
blacks were killed in factional violence and one black youth died
when police fired on a mob.
   About 400 people have died in recent weeks in nationwide
political violence, most of it in Natal. Hundreds have been injured
and thousands left homeless. The main combatants in Natal are
supporters of the African National Congress and Inkatha, a
relatively conservative Zulu organization.
   More than 6,000 people have died in South Africa since national
political unrest erupted in 1985, with two-thirds of the deaths in
Natal. The Disabled People of South Africa said 10,000 had been
disabled in the past three years of fighting in Natal.
   ``Do we really want a South Africa full of disabled people?''
said the organization's co-chairman, Friday Mavuso. He wept as he
led the protest march in his wheelchair.
   Also Tuesday, in southern Cape province, municipal workers
bulldozed more than 60 squatter shacks, leaving more than 130 black
people homeless in Kraaifontein. The local council is controlled by
the right-wing Conservative Party, which supports apartheid.
   The independent South African Press Association said police with
semi-automatic weapons, teargas launchers and rifles guarded the
municipal bulldozers, while the residents scurried about removing
belongings and salvaging wood and iron building materials from
their flattened homes.
   In an effort to clear obstacles to formal talks on ending
white-minority rule, ANC leader Nelson Mandela will lead an
11-member delegation in talks with the government next month.
   The ANC announced Tuesday the talks will be held May 2-4.

   Participants in an international media conference
said Tuesday that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and
new communications technology have combined to open up the East
bloc to the rest of the world.
   But at least one Western journalist taking part in the 11th
World Media Conference expressed concern over the closing of
Lithuania and other restive Soviet republics to foreign reporters.
   The World Media Conference, meeting for the first time in
Moscow, began a three-day symposium Tuesday to discuss the impact
of political changes in the Soviet Union on international
communications.
   About 500 delegates from 60 countries, including many former
heads of state, attended the meeting of the association, which was
founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon to encourage East-West
communications.
   Allen H. Neuharth, founder of the newspaper USA Today, told an
afternoon panel discussion that advanced satellite communications
and publishing technology have opened a new window on the world.
   He said people around the world were able to watch the events
unfolding in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe on television and
read about them almost immediately in newspapers.
   ``There are no more secrets in the world,'' Neuharth said.
   He said the media, now and in the future, would play a key role
in the shaping of global events. It is ``the glue that will hold
the globe together or tear it apart,'' he said.
   Andrei Grachev, deputy director of the Communist Party Central
Committee's International Affairs Department, agreed.
   ``The 20th century began as an age of electronics, and is ending
as the age of communications,'' Grachev said.
   ``We are living in an age where secrets cannot be kept,'' he
said, citing the example of foreign scientists who detected the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and satellite intelligence on the
location of nuclear missile sites.
   Most panelists agreed that Gorbachev's policies of perestroika
and glasnost helped create the conditions for radical change in the
East bloc and the speedy reporting of events in East bloc nations.
   However, Jim Laurie, Moscow bureau chief for ABC News, noted
that in cases of unrest, several republics had been closed to
foreign reporters. Recently, Western journalists were ordered out
of Lithuania after the republic declared its independence.
   The absence of foreign journalists could lead to partisan
manipulation of the media by means of circulating stories that
could not be independently checked, Laurie said.
   Arthur Hartman, the U.S. Ambassador to Moscow from 1981-1987,
concurred that glasnost and perestroika were praiseworthy.
   He urged a substantial increase in the exchange of experts in
all fields to improve relations between the East and West,
particularly in the economics area.
   Moon said in opening remarks that perestroika made it possible
for the conference to be held in Moscow.
   ``I feel there is no place more appropriate to gather for these
discussions than right here in the Soviet Union,'' Moon said.
   Among the foreign delegates attending the conference were former
NATO Secretary-General Joseph Luns; former Argentinian President
Raul Alfonsin; former Colombian President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen;
and Jihan Sadat, widow of the slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   Media representatives included Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor in
chief of the Washington Times newspaper; and Bo Hi Pak, publisher
of the Washington Times and president of the World Media
Association.
   Soviet participants included Vadim Zagladin, an adviser to
Gorbachev; economist Abel Aganbegyan; and Nikolai Shishlin, a
foreign policy adviser to the Communist Party Central Committee.

<HEAD>Prosecutors May Face Stalemate in Stuart Shooting Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors of the Charles Stuart shooting case
may face a stalemate if they cannot persuade an appeals court judge
to force Stuart's attorney to testify about his client.
   At issue is whether the attorney-client privilege should be
overridden in the interests of justice. For prosecutors, who appear
to have run out of leads, it could mean their last chance to crack
the tangled case.
   Stuart apparently committed suicide on Jan. 4 after being
implicated in the shooting death of his pregnant wife. Her killing
on Oct. 23 shocked Bostonians and raised racial tensions in the
city when Stuart, who was white, said his wife's attacker was black.
   A Superior Court judge in Suffolk County, which includes Boston,
declined to rule on the attorney-client issue Monday. He asked the
state appeals court to decide.
   Suffolk County prosecutors had asked Judge James P. Donohue at a
closed hearing last week to override the client-attorney privilege
between Charles Stuart and his former lawyer, John Dawley. They
asked that he order Dawley to tell the grand jury what Stuart told
him during a two-hour conversation a day before Stuart's apparent
suicide.
   Although Donohue did not immediately act on the request, he did
shed light on previously secret grand jury evidence about the case.
   In a report to the appeals court, Donohue described some grand
jury testimony, including that of Stuart's brother, Matthew.
According to the judge, Matthew Stuart said he ``was an unwilling
participant'' in the shooting and thought he was taking part in an
insurance scam for which he would be paid $10,000.
   The report confirmed many elements of the case that previously
had been reported in the news media.
   The Stuart case began with a dramatic telephon call to an
emergency dispatcher from Charles Stuart, who reported on his car
telephone that his wife had been shot in the head and he had been
shot in the stomach.
   Carol Stuart died hours later; their prematurely delivered son
died 17 days later.
   Stuart told police he and his wife had been shot by a robber who
jumped into their car after they left a pre-natal class at Brigham
and Women's Hospital.
   But Matthew Stuart went to authorities Jan. 3 and implicated
Charles in the shooting. Charles Stuart apparently jumped to his
death from a bridge the next day.
   In his memorandum, Donohue said the grand jury was told that
Matthew was to meet his brother at a predetermined location Oct. 23
to get items that later would be claimed to have been stolen, and
an insurance claim would be filed.
   The grand jury, according to the report, was told Matthew pulled
alongside his brother's car and talked to him, but was not aware
his brother was wounded or that Carol was in the car.
   ``Matthew Stuart told witnesses that he thought there was a bag
of laundry or a duffle bag in the front seat of the car. Matthew
said that Charles passed him several items, including a handgun,''
Donohue said the grand jury was told.
   Matthew Stuart told police he and a friend dropped the gun and a
handbag into the Pines River in Revere. The items were recovered.

<HEAD>Journalist Fined for Not Revealing Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter who refused to reveal a source was
fined $8,200 on Tuesday by a High Court judge, who ruled out prison
for ``an otherwise perfectly honorable man.''
   Bill Goodwin faced a possible jail sentence because he refused
to hand over notes identifying a person who telephoned him at The
Engineer trade magazine with confidential information on a
company's financial details.
   By court order, the name of the company involved cannot be
published.
   Justice Leonard Hoffmann said the journalist's refusal to reveal
the source had no legal or moral basis but added, ``the prisons
have enough problems without having to take an otherwise perfectly
honorable man like yourself.''
   Britain has faced growing prison unrest since rioting inmates
took over Strangeways Prison in Manchester on April 1.
   The 24-year-old reporter said he hoped Parliament would change
the law that allows journalists to be held in contempt of court for
protecting confidential sources.
   ``It has been a difficult and nerve-wracking time,'' he said.
``I'm very relieved at the outcome but I regret that as the law
stands, journalists who come after me will be in danger of prison
sentences demanded by anonymous companies.''
   The information Goodwin received in the Nov. 2, 1989 telephone
call was believed to have come from a document marked ``strictly
confidential'' and stolen from the company.
   Goodwin, unaware of the theft, wrote a draft article and
telephoned the company for its reaction.
   The article was never published because of the court action.
   Hoffmann ruled that Goodwin's notes should be disclosed since
the company needed to know whom to sue for the return of the stolen
document.
   The judge awarded the unnamed company legal costs.
   Goodwin has not said who paid for his defense. Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the defense is
believed to have cost more than $164,000.
   The National Union of Journalists said it was launching an
appeal to assist Goodwin pay the fine. He told the court his salary
is $17,200 a year and his savings are $2,500.

   Jim Whittaker, the first American to
conquer Mount Everest who was injured last week during another
climb, said Tuesday he hoped to rejoin his expedition for its
planned summit assault on Earth Day.
   Whittaker was admitted to the Teaching Hospital in Katmandu on
Saturday for treatment of a blood clot in his calf. He said he hit
his leg against a rock Friday and that the 275-mile trip down was
painful.
   The pain has subsided and ``doctors say I can go back in 10
days,'' said Whittaker, 61, of Port Townsend, Wash.
   ``While coming down, every time the car hit rough ground, the
calf went ghar ghar,'' Whittaker said with a grimace.
   Whittaker was leading a 30-member expedition from the United
States, the Soviet Union and China which plans to put one man from
each country on top of Mount Everest on April 22, the 20th
anniversary of Earth Day.
   ``It is the first time the Soviets and the Chinese are climbing
together. We brought them together,'' said Whittaker.

   Twentieth Century Fox has lifted its ban against
critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, who gave harsh reviews of a
recent Fox film.
   The studio said three weeks ago that Ebert and Siskel would be
barred indefinitely from preview screenings after both critics said
on a television talk show that the comedy ``Nuns on the Run''
wasn't funny.
   But Siskel called Fox shortly before a Monday screening of
another Fox film and asked if he was still unwelcome.
   It was the first Fox screening here since ``Nuns on the Run.''
   The ban was over, a company spokesman said, and Siskel went to
the show. Ebert didn't know about the lifting of the ban and was
out of town.
   ``I'm happy the ban is lifted,'' Ebert said. ``I feel
vindicated. In the future I will continue to review Fox films in
the same evenhanded way I have in the past.
   ``The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I had predicted
the ban would last only one film and Roger had predicted it would
last none,'' Siskel said. ``Roger was right and he's going to be
hard to deal with when he gets home.''
   The two appear on ``At the Movies,'' a syndicated half-hour
television show.

   Model Kim Alexis says she's unretouched by human
hands, and she intends to stay that way.
   The 29-year-old blonde says in the May issue of Redbook magazine
that she's adamantly opposed to plastic surgery, although many of
her modeling cohorts have undergone body-enhancing surgery.
   ``I'm probably the only model in New York who hasn't had breast
implants,'' Alexis said, adding that the idea of a facelift makes
her particularly queasy.
   ``Yuck! The idea of someone chiseling into my face _ I just
don't believe in it,'' she said. ``I don't think I'll ever want a
facelift. ... Besides, wrinkles do add character.''

   A pool cue stick valued at $1,000 that
was used by actors Tom Cruise and Paul Newman in the movie ``The
Color of Money'' has been stolen, authorities said.
   The owner is offering a $500 reward for information leading to
the arrest or conviction of those involved in Saturday night's
theft of the cue from The Parlor billards supply store.
   ``It was originally auctioned with the set of 12 that the actors
used in the movie,'' owner Robert Torbert said Monday. ``I let my
emotions get away with me when I bought this one. Both Tom Cruise
and Paul Newman stroked with the cue.''
   A cue valued at $1,200 and twelve other less valuable cues also
were stolen.
   Thieves might have found out about the sticks by posing as
customers, said police Officer Steve Evans.

   Valerie Harper says that taking care of her
dying mother reaffirmed her appreciation of life.
   ``It brought home to me the idea that every day is precious, and
it's important to stay in each moment as much as you possibly
can,'' the actress says in the May issue of Redbook.
   Harper, her husband, Tony Cacciotti, and their 4-year-old
daughter, Cristina, shared their Los Angeles home for nearly seven
months with Iva Harper, 77, a former nurse, who suffered from lung
cancer.
   ``Two days before she died, she woke up from a nap and said,
`Oh, Valerie! I feel so light. This is the happiest day of my life!
It was so wonderful to see mama and papa and all my aunts and
uncles again. We were running and having a picnic on a green hill
and there was white light all around us.'
   ``This was the oddest thing for her to tell me, especially since
all those people have been dead for years,'' said Harper. ``But Mom
was up and beaming. I knew she was ready to go.''
   Ida Harper died in October 1988.

<HEAD>Bush Says Soviets Know Force In Lithuania Would Sour Relations
with U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday that the Soviet
Union has a clear understanding that the use of force against the
independence movement in Lithuania would sour relations with the
United States.
   ``I think they know that loud and clear by now, very clear,''
Bush said.
   Commenting to reporters on board Air Force One as he flew to
Toronto for meetings with Candian Prime Minister Mulroney, Bush was
asked about Gorbachev's decision Monday to take measures to protect
Soviet interests in Lithuania.
   ``I've made our position very clear _ peaceful resolution of
this question _ because we do not recognize that the use of force
would accomplish anything other than to set back relations,'' Bush
said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also
renewed the U.S. call for the opening of a process on Lithuania
leading to peaceful dialogue.
   ``What is not needed is a further escalation of tensions,'' she
said.
   ``What is needed is a process, a dialogue that can meet the
hopes and aspirations of the Lithuanian people,'' she added.
   That point was driven home repeatedly to Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in lengthy meetings here last week by both
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, she said.
   ``There is no doubt in his mind,'' she said. ``It was made
perfectly clear and there is no doubt that this can have an impact
on U.S.-Soviet relations, that there is a risk to relations.''
   For his part, she said, Shevardnadze emphasized in both private
and public statements ``that dialogue was the only answer and that
a peaceful way would be found to respond to both Soviet and
Lithuanian needs.''
   At a news conference Friday night, Shevardnadze said Soviet
leaders have ``no other intentions'' than to solve the independence
crisis in Lithuania through peaceful means, ``in line with our
constitution, our main law.''
   He was reminded that he had said earlier that ``certain
administrative measures'' might have to be taken and was asked if
he could elaborate.
   ``No, I cannot,'' Shevardnadze replied and added: ``Because when
I spoke about the administrative measures, I was referring to the
actions of militia _ which you describe here as police _ and other
authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring normal conditions
of life in any city or in any village.''

   A year ago, the smell of death clung to
the Rancho Santa Elena, where police dug up 13 mutilated corpses,
victims of a cult of drug smugglers who sacrificed humans for
magical protection.
   Two more bodies were found at a nearby farm.
   More a farm than a ranch, Rancho Santa Elena is returning to the
rural obscurity it enjoyed before it was a ``human slaughterhouse''
that sickened even experienced lawmen.
   The land is still pockmarked with shallow grave excavations and
people have been seen digging recently, perhaps in search of
missing relatives.
   But nature has started to reclaim the land. Grass and bright
yellow wildflowers are doing their best to fill them in. The
pungent odor of decomposing human flesh that hung for days after
the exhumations on April 11, 1989, has long blown away in the
prevailing Gulf Coast breeze.
   Even a shack where the cult reportedly sacrificed 21-year-old
University of Texas student Mark Kilroy, a 14-year-old Mexican boy
and others has burned to the ground. Mexican Federal Judicial
Police brought a ``curandero,'' or witch doctor, to perform a
purification ceremony on the grounds before they torched the
building last spring.
   All that remains is a concrete slab, piles of trash, rusting
farm machinery, sheets of corrugated metal from the roof.
   Residents of the farming area 13 miles west of Matamoros, across
the border from Brownsville, Texas, say they don't think much about
the horrifying events that took place there. But others remind them
from time to time.
   ``When you mention you live near Rancho Santa Elena, people get
nervous,'' said Fidel Trevino Villarreal, who has lived at an
adjacent farm since birth in 1926.
   He said he never heard or saw anything unusual at the Santa
Elena before the grisly discovery, even on the many nights he spent
irrigating his fields.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez in Brownsville, who described
the scene as ``a human slaughterhouse,'' said he also lost sleep
for a while after observing the bodies, some with their hearts and
lungs removed.
   The case broke, Mexican police said, when Helio Hernandez,
believing he was invisible, ran his pickup through a checkpoint.
Police then searched the rancho, owned by his family, expecting to
make a marijuana seizure.
   What they found instead were the bodies and signs of human
torture and bizarre rituals.
   Hernandez and three other suspects led police to the graves and
to the Matamoros apartment of Sara Aldrete Villarreal, an honor
student at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville. In her
apartment, police found an occult altar.
   She was not arrested until a month later at a Mexico City
apartment. Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, the alleged ``godfather'' of
the cult, ordered himself and a male companion killed as police
closed in on the apartment.
   Experts concluded that they practiced a variation of the
Afro-Cuban religion of Palo Mayombe, in which believers use human
bones, but do not normally kill to obtain them.
   Seven people, including Aldrete, remain jailed in Mexico
awaiting verdicts on charges including homicide, illegal burial and
weapons and drug violations. One defendant, ranch caretaker Domingo
Bustamante Reyes, has been charged only with cover-up.
   Some holes at the rancho appear recently dug. Police speculate
that Mexicans desperate to find missing loved ones go there seeking
graves.
   Trevino said he sees people digging from time to time at the
ranch, ``but I don't go over there. I don't want anybody to think
I'm helping them.''

   The FBI on Tuesday awarded its first Medal of
Valor to agent Edmundo Mireles Jr., who was severely wounded in a
Miami shootout and later joined a class-action lawsuit accusing the
bureau of discrimination against Hispanics.
   Mireles and fellow agents were involved in a shootout outside
Miami on April 11, 1986, when they tried to follow a car carrying
two men they suspected were involved in a series of violent bank
robberies.
   ``Special agent Mireles found himself face to face with his
moment of truth,'' FBI Director William Sessions said at the award
ceremony. ``His fellow agents were down. He himself was severely
wounded.
   ``Yet in the face of appalling gunfire, he found the courage and
the stamina to return fire and fatally wounded both Michael Lee
Platt and William Russell Matix,'' Sessions said.
   The Medal of Valor is given for ``exceptional acts of heroism in
the face of ife-threatening situations.''
   Mireles accepted the award in part in the memory of the two
agents slain that day _ Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove _ and gave
special recognition to two other agents who helped him survive.
   ``Gilbert Orantia and Ron Riesner ... saved my life on that
day.''
   Officials later learned that Platt and Matix were not involved
in the bank robberies but were suspects in a series of attempted
killings.
   Mireles, 36, took a year to recover from his wounds, which
shattered one arm. He still works on bank robbery cases in the
Miami office, said FBI spokesman Greg Jones.
   A federal judge in Texas, ruling last year on the 1988
class-action lawsuit filed by 311 Hispanic agents, found there was
pervasive discrimination against Hispanic FBI agents and ordered
the bureau to take steps to promote Hispanics.
   James Perez, the bureau's new equal opportunity chief, told
Congress last month that the FBI had been ill-equipped until
recently to investigate complaints of race and sex discrimination.
He said the staffing of his office has been beefed up to handle
such cases.
   Mireles gave mixed answers when asked whether the FBI was trying
to send a message to Hispanic agents by giving him its first Medal
of Valor.
   ``I don't think this award is being given to a Hispanic or a
black or a white FBI agent, or a male or a female,'' he said. ``My
understanding of why I got the medal is for action rather than for
ethnic background or gender.''
   But when asked several minutes later whether the FBI was making
a statement, he said, ``I'm sure they are.''
   FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez said the fact that Mireles is
Hispanic ``was not a consideration at all, as far as I know. ... He
deserved the Medal of Valor and that's why he was given it.''
   Mireles said discrimination at the FBI is ``done by individuals,
not by the organization as a whole. It's difficult to control what
an individual thinks. ... We're all human.''
   The FBI, he said, ``is making a good effort to try to correct
some perceived wrongs, and it's trying to make the working
environment for all agents better. But you can't change an
organization overnight.''

   The Soviet military is playing its most
visible role in Kremlin politics in three years, U.S. government
analysts said Tuesday.
   The sources cite last week's setback in superpower arms-control
talks and Moscow's hard-line response to the Lithuanian
independence movement.
   ``The two developments appear to be related,'' said one
administration source, who, like others, spoke on the condition he
not be further identified.
   While offering several possible explanations for why military
officers are playing a more prominent role than at any time since
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reshuffled the military
command in June 1987, analysts said they did not think that the
military had increased its power at Gorbachev's expense.
   ``But military officers do seem to be flexing their muscles a
little more,'' said one source, noting that Soviet officers have
played a key role in the response to Lithuania's attempts to become
an independent nation.
   Analysts offered these scenarios:
   _One possibility is that the military is increasing its
prominence on instructions from Gorbachev.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that although the military is
playing a more visible role, the decisions are being made by
political authorities,'' said one administration arms-control
expert.
   _A second theory is that Gorbachev is allowing the military to
play a heavy-handed role in Lithuania. If the approach fails, ``he
can simply walk away from it and say that it was not his policy,
after all,'' said another source.
   _A third possibility is that Gorbachev and other civilian
leaders are preoccupied and that military officers are filling the
vacuum where they see their interests threatened, one analyst said.
   The more visible military role became clear shortly after
Lithuania declared independence on March 11.
   The commander of all Soviet ground forces, Gen. Valentin I.
Varennikov, was present in Lithuania as Soviet forces seized
government, party and publishing offices, arresting deserters from
the Soviet Army, and rumbling through Vilnius in tanks.
   As for arms control, a setback became apparent last week during
talks in Washington between Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   U.S. negotiators were ``working on the assumption that we would
make progress at the same rate we have since last year. What we had
to hoped to accomplish at the meeting did not get done,'' said one
administration source.
   Over the last year, the Soviets made concessions on three major
START issues: their objection to the Strategic Defense Initiative,
their insistence that the treaty cover submarine-launched cruise
missiles (SLCMs), and rules for counting air-launched cruise
missiles (ALCMs).
   Last week, the Soviets revived their demand that the treaty
require the two sides to issue a separate declaration setting
limits on SLCMs, administration sources said.
   The Soviets also revived their insistence that the treaty cover
all ALCMs with ranges above 360 miles. The Americans want to count
only missiles above 900 miles, thus excluding ALCMs aboard tactical
warplanes, such as the F-15 and the F-111-B, the sources said.
   One source interpreted the tougher Soviet arms position as a
retrenchment by the Soviet military.
   ``They were apparently angry over the concessions made by
civilian negotiators, and wanted to regain some lost ground,'' one
administration source said.
   However, another source attributed the change to Kremlin tactics
designed to increase pressure on the Americans as negotiators
struggle to complete a START deal before the summit.
   President Bush, meeting with reporters as he flew to Toronto to
attend a baseball game and meet with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, commented on both developments.
   On Lithuania, he said he had warned the Kremlin that a crackdown
could damage superpower relations.
   ``I've made our position very clear _ peaceful resolution of
this question, because we do not recognize that the use of force
would accomplish anything other than to set back relations. And I
think they know that loud and clear by now, very clear,'' Bush said.
   On the slowdown on arms-control progress, Bush said he still
hopes the two sides can complete a proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty to cut long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50
percent.
   Despite the latest glitch, the president said he was directing
U.S. negotiators to ``go back and work hard.''
   ``We got a time frame now in which there's an awful lot to be
done, so I can't predict how much will be done by the time the
summit rolls around'' on May 30, Bush said.

   One of the longest streaks in the history of
Atlanta Braves baseball has come to an end _ Pearl Sandow is on the
disabled list.
   Until Tuesday, Ms. Sandow had seen very one of the 1,899 home
games the team has played since it moved to Atlanta from Milwaukee
in 1966.
   A statue of her is in the fans' section at the baseball Hall of
Fame at Cooperstown, N.Y.
   But she broke both shoulders in a traffic accident and had to
stay home Tuesday and miss the opening of the Braves' 25th season
at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
   ``I hate that I'm going to miss them,'' she said. ``But I'm
excited about the season opening.''
   ``I don't think I'm going to make it back to a game until
June,'' said the retiree, who declines to give her age.
   As soon as she is able, Ms. Sandow says she will once again be
in seat one, row nine, section 105, the same seat she has occupied
while watching each of the Braves' 947 home victories _ and 952
home defeats.
   She purchased a season ticket for the seat, which is down the
first base line, after looking at a chart before the stadium was
even built. In 1965, while the Braves were still in Milwaukee, she
was a devoted fan of the Atlanta Crackers, a Southern Association
team, which played a season in the new stadium. She saw all their
home games, too.
   In 1975, in recognition of her loyalty, the Braves gave Ms.
Sandow a lifetime pass. But she still buys a season ticket for the
seat next to her, the seat she calls her ``junk seat'' because when
it's not occupied by a friend it holds her purse and other ``junk.''
   Despite the Braves' average of 96 losses per season over the
past five years, Ms. Sandow says: ``As long as they try I can take
it. We can't win all the time. But I can't stand sloppy baseball.''

<HEAD>Americans Warn Europe of `Tidal Wave' of Cocaine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials told European nations Tuesday that
the American market for illegal drugs is nearly saturated and
dealers will soon be bombarding this side of the Atlantic with huge
amounts of cocaine.
   However, British and Dutch officials said it's too early to
predict such a cocaine epidemic in Europe.
   The comments were exchanged during the World Ministerial Drugs
Summit, sponsored by Britain and the United Nations. More than 800
delegates from 112 countries have focused on ways to reduce the
demand for drugs and to combat cocaine. The three-day conference
ends Wednesday.
   Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, an official with the U.S. Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said he expects cocaine use to
increase sharply in Europe because there is little room for growth
in American sales and the drug cartels are thus looking across the
ocean.
   ``I think ... that cocaine is really beginning to hit Europe and
England,'' he said, adding that ``my fear is that there basically
is a tidal wave of cocaine coming your way.''
   Douglas Tweddle, chief investigator for Britain's Customs and
Excise department, acknowledged that more cocaine will undoubtedly
come to Europe ``because we have the ability to pay for it.''
However, he added that to talk of a tidal wave ``seems somewhat
emotive.''
   ``We are trying our best to contain the cocaine problem before
it gets to American proportions,'' he told a news conference. ``I
don't think it will be as bad as it has been in the United States.''
   Dr. Eddy L. Engelsman, an official of the Ministry of Welfare,
Public Health and Cultural Affairs in the Netherlands, said an
explosion in cocaine use should not be predicted in Europe.
   ``We can talk about threats, but that's what we've done over 10
years now and the level of cannabis use, for instance, in America
has reached much higher peaks than it ever has done in Europe,'' he
said.
   U.S. Secretary of Health Dr. Louis Sullivan said the United
States has alerted European nations to take action to reduce the
demand for cocaine and to block shipments.
   ``The major source of wealth beyond the United States is Europe
and Japan, and data from our sources say the European market is
looked on by the cartels as a growth market,'' he said.
   Italy's Interior Minister Antonio Gava, quoting figures from the
international police agency Interpol, said Monday that cocaine
seizures in Europe have increased from 3,300 pounds in 1986 to
13,860 pounds in 1989. In the first three months of 1990, he said,
authorities seized 8,800 pounds.
   In his comments, Kleber said stripping drugs of glamour and
holding users accountable for their actions had helped cut casual
use of cocaine by 37 percent over the last three years in the
United States.
   He said drug users know the consequences of indulging range from
suspending a pilot's license to expulsion from school or
imprisonment.
   However, Engelsman of the Netherlands said treating drug users
like smokers or alcoholics has worked in his country.
   Even though marijuana is sold in coffee bars, he said, Dutch
youngsters understand the message that drugs are unhealthy. He said
only 2 percent of those up to 19 years old used marijuana during
the last month and less than 0.5 percent used heroin and cocaine.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of soldiers patrolled this
city Tuesday after a governing party leader was wounded and a
militant opposition leader began a hunger strike to protest the
arrests of his supporters in the incident.
   Authorities feared a new round of violence between members of
the Pakistan People's Party of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
the Mohajir Qami Movement, which claims discrimination against the
Indian immigrants it represents.
   Hospital sources said Najeeb Ahmad, 22, a student leader of Ms.
Bhutto's party, remained in a coma after a weekend shooting spree
that left 17 people dead and 55 wounded. His chances of surviving
were considered low, said physicians, who refused to be identified.
   Thousands of supporters keeping a 24-hour vigil outside the
hospital blame Ahmad's injuries on the Mohajir Qami Movement.
   The movement's militant leader, Altaf Hussein has vowed to
starve himself to death unless police release 21 of his supporters,
arrested in connection with the weekend shooting spree.
   About 5,000 soldiers have been patrolling Hussein's neighborhood
in Karachi's congested central district, since he began his hunger
strike.
   Thousands of supporters have camped out in front of his home,
many of them wailing and chanting slogans against Ms. Bhutto's
party.
   Arif Ahmed, 28, swooned and cried.
   ``I am prepared to die with my leader,'' he said joining Hussein
in his hunger strike.
   Selma Khatoon, a Pakistani woman, hidden behind a flowing shawl,
said ``I am praying around the clock for the life and health of
Altaf Hussein.
   ``I am helpful he will be alive to protect the Mohajirs
interest,'' she said.
   In a prepared release, the southern Sindh provincial government,
dominated by Ms. Bhutto's party, said ``some people who want to
blackmail and believe in terrorism are trying to create a law and
order situation.''
   ``The demands of the MQM are that there should not be any legal
action against the terrorists and against all those involved in
various crimes,'' the prepared release said in reference to the
Mohajir Qami Movement.
   The two parties regularly exchange charges of terrorism,
kidnapping and torture.
   In the past several years about 1,000 people have been killed in
ethnic-related violence. The main opponents are Sindh nationalists,
who want greater autonomy for their southern province, and
Hussein's MQM, who want to be recognized as a fifth nationality.
   Hussein claims that Indian immigrants, who dominate Sindh's
cities of Karachi and Hyderabad, 100 miles to the north, have been
denied jobs and promotions because of their origins.
   Pakistan became independent of British colonial rule in 1947.

<HEAD>Johnson's Widow Says Criticism of LBJ Would Anger Her, If She Read

   Lady Bird Johnson said Tuesday that some of
the things written about her husband would make her angry if she
read them, so ``the simplest thing is not to read them.''
   That was the closest the former first lady, meeting with
reporters before a speech winding up a Johnson administration
reunion, came to commenting on the furor over Robert Caro's ``Means
of Ascent.''
   The book, the second volume of a projected multi-volume
biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, has been sharply criticized by
Johnson associates and some reviewers who say it is unduly harsh on
the 36th president.
   Caro defends his research and says a more positive picture of
Johnson's achievements will emerge in later volumes.
   Mrs. Johnson, asked simply whether ``negative'' books and other
writings about her late husband made her angry, replied, ``I'm sure
they would if I read them, so the simplest thing is not to read
them.''
   The former first lady was interviewed in the front parlor of the
Woman's National Democratic Club, with pictures of herself and
other presidential wives on the wall. Visible through a window was
a garden she dedicated during the Johnsons' White House years.
   Mrs. Johnson was in Washington for a series of events in
connection with the 25th anniversary of Johnson's inauguration as
an elected president in 1965.
   In her speech, the widow of the man who was president from 1963
to 1969 dealt mainly with her work on behalf of beautification and
the environment, both while in the White House and since leaving it.
   Mrs. Johnson told reporters the reunion has been fun, although
``neither my eyes nor my legs are as strong as they once were.''
   She said she wouldn't want to be back in the White House, though.
   ``It's too much of a crescendo of activity, and when you are 77,
you want to lie in the hammock and savor the world.''

   The government imposed new security
measures Tuesday in southeastern provinces after five people were
reported killed in a raid by Kurdish guerrillas.
   The regional governor's office said nine others were wounded
Monday night in the village of Ovecik in the township of Catak.
   Officials said security forces killed 22 suspected Kurdish
guerrillas and wounded 18 others in clashes over the weekend and
Monday evening in Beytussebab township, near the Iraqi border.
   Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting in 11 southeastern
provinces to establish an independent state.
   About 2,500 civilians, guerrillas and security forces have died
since 1984 in clashes linked to the Kurdish independence drive led
by the Kurdish Labor Party. The Marxist group has camps in
neighboring Syria, Iraq and Iran.
   A government decree, which took effect Tuesday, gives the
regional governor authority to ban strikes and expel residents from
the region if the public order is threatened.
   The decree also bars the Turkish press from carrying stories
that might harm security operations.
   The regional governor will be able to ban publications or close
their printing plants if they run stories that are untruthful or
threaten law and order, the decree said.
   Publications will also face a fine of up to $40,000, it added.
   The decree also said the state-run radio and television should
prepare reports from the region in coordination with the interior
ministry.
   The decree was criticized by Erdal Inonu, chairman of the main
opposition Social Democrat Populist Party.
   Inonu said the press should not be censored in democracies and
called the measure to expel residents a violation of human rights.
   The decree was approved Monday at a Cabinet meeting. At the
meeting, the government also adopted a measure that would provide
90,000 new job opportunities at state offices and factories in the
southeastern provinces.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
55 million.

<BYLINE>Cargo Door Incident Blamed on Airline, Manufacturer, FAA
^By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accident that sucked nine United passengers
out of a Boeing jumbo jet over the Pacific Ocean resulted from
failures by the airline, manufacturer and FAA to correct problems
in cargo doors on 747 airliners, federal investigators said Tuesday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board voted 3-0 to accept the
results of a more than 13-month investigation despite the fact a
key piece of evidence in the Feb. 24, 1989, incident remains three
miles under water: Flight 811's cargo door.
   The NTSB said United failed to properly inspect the door after
its electrical system failed in December 1988 and mechanics had to
operate it manually. The door had been operated electrically since
then, however.
   Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration were cited for
failing to order timely corrective measures after another cargo
door partially popped open on a 1987 Pan American jet flying from
London to New York. That plane returned safely to London.
   On Flight 811, the door ripped off at 22,000 feet. A piece of
the fuselage was ripped off and the passengers and their seats were
sucked out through the hole in the plane.
   The plane, en route to New Zealand, returned to Honolulu. Five
other passengers were seriously hurt and 33 had minor injuries. The
plane carried a crew of 18 and 337 passengers.
   United spokesman Robert Dowdy said the airline had complied with
all FAA requirements except in one instance. That occurred after
six words mandating an inspection were left out of an FAA
regulation when it was copied into the company's system, he said.
   Dowdy said that despite the oversight, the door had undergone
three inspections since the December 1988 problem was corrected.
   ``We think the board has done a good job with the evidence and
data available,'' Dowdy said, adding that a better investigation
and probable cause could be determined if the door is recovered.
   Boeing had recommended that the board conclude that probable
cause of the incident could not be determined.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the company had no
comment on the NTSB finding ``except to say we feel, No. 1, those
cargo doors are safe.''
   ``There were subsequent changes made as a result of the
accident, changes and inspection processes. All of the necessary
actions have been taken to ensure integrity of that door's
operation in flight,'' Gamble said.
   The board said the current cargo door system on 747s can
indicate to the pilot that the door is locked when it is not.
That's expected to be changed with an imminent FAA order that would
require detectors on the locks, said Ron Schleed, investigator in
charge for the accident.
   The FAA already has issued orders to ensure that Boeing 747
cargo doors are secure and more thoroughly inspected after each
closing.
   Schleed said efforts to locate and recover the cargo door from
the ocean would continue. He said a Navy vessel and sophisticated
probe device would be available in June to conduct a search that
would be limited to about two weeks.
   Radar was able to track the door as it fell, but it was lost
about 3,000 feet before it hit the water, Schleed said.
   Investigators hope the door will show whether parts were damaged
before the failure. They have evidence of damage in the mechanism,
which they speculate may have been caused by a faulty electrical
device or by turning a wrench the wrong way when the door was
closed manually, Schleed said.

   The release of official final results
in national elections has been postponed because of irregularities
in several districts, an official said Tuesday.
   An announcement of final results had been expected by Tuesday.
But Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Electoral Committee,
told reporters the official tallies would be released at a later
date. He did not say when.
   Nemeth said the irregularities would be investigated.
   Voters chose Hungary's first freely elected parliament in 43
years. Unofficial results indicate an overwhelming victory for the
main conservative party.
   The results, released Monday by the national vote counting
center, showed the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum winning
165 of 386 parliamentary seats. The Democratic Forum will hold
42.75 percent of the seats in the new parliament.
   The unofficial tally also showed the liberal Alliance of Free
Democrats with 92 seats, or 23.83 percent; the agrarian
Smallholders with 43 seats and 11.14 percent; the Socialist Party,
formed by reformers from the now-disbanded Communist Party, with 33
seats and 8.55 percent; and the Federation of Young Democrats and
the Christian Democrats even at 21 seats each and 5.44 percent each.
   The Democratic Forum is expected to form a conservative
governing coalition with the Smallholders and the Christian
Democrats.
   The Interior Ministry's electoral office said there were ``major
mistakes'' in the figures provided by three constituencies.
   ``Correction of these mistakes may lead to some major
modifications of the results,'' the state MTI news agency said,
without elaboration.
   Nemeth told reporters that in several districts, including
Budapest, there were reports some people voted twice.
   In 11 cases, electoral committees registered people who ``did
not have the right to vote,'' MTI said.

<TEXT>
   Patients with spinal cord injuries may not be
getting a new treatment that reduces paralysis because federal
health officials have not sent research data to physicians, a
consumer advocacy group said Tuesday.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group called it a ``colossal
failure of communication'' and said that ``any further delay in
notifying all emergency rooms about this is recklessly
irresponsible.''
   The group called on Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan to send information about the therapy to emergency room
and trauma care physicians to alert those who may not have heard
about it through the media and to allow them to evaluate data
documenting the effectiveness of the drug.
   On March 30, federal health officials announced the results of a
government study showing that high doses of the drug
methylprednisolone given within eight hours of a spinal cord injury
was able to restore some feeling and movement in virtually all
spinal cord injury patients.
   The drug has been used for years for other purposes, but its use
in massive doses marked the first time an effective treatment for
such paralyzing injuries had been found. Since about 95 percent of
all spinal cord patients are admitted to hospitals within eight
hours, most could benefit from the treatment, researchers said.
   Officials at the National Institutes of Health said they
deviated from usual practice and released the results before
publication in a medical journal in hopes that patients could
benefit immediately. Study results are to be published in May in
the New England Journal of Medicine.
   They said doctors could obtain information about treatment with
the drug by calling (301) 496-5751 during working hours. Also, for
the first weekend after the news conference, a toll-free number was
set up with a recorded message giving information about treatment.
   More than 1,000 inquiries were received that weekend and 500
have been received on the daytime number, said Jim Brown, an HHS
spokesman.
   But Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Ralph Nader-founded Public
Citizen Health Research Group, noted that a Newsday survey last
week found that six of the nine major trauma centers in the New
York area had not started to use the treatment because they had not
seen the study data.
   Brown said Wolfe's letter is being reviewed.
   Wolfe said a breakthrough such as researchers found with high
doses of methylprednisolone occurs only once or twice a year, but
the public health officials should establish a way for word of
these findings to get to physicians quickly.
   ``The stakes are too high,'' he said. In the case of
methylprednisolone, ``this drug makes a difference between being on
crutches and being in a wheelchair.''

<HEAD>Cheney Asks Air Force For Explanation On F-117A</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has asked the
Air Force to find out why he was not told for months that a F-117A
Stealth fighter-bomber dropped its bomb far off-target in the
Panama invasion, an aide said Tuesday.
   ``The secretary has asked the Air Force for an explanation,''
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters. He said Cheney was
``eager to know what the chain of information was.''
   Air Force officials said there was no intention of misleading
Cheney but that ``miscommunication'' took place within the chain of
command.
   Williams confirmed Friday that neither he nor Cheney were told
the full story about the F117A's performance during the Dec. 20
operation until April 3.
   In the days following the U.S. invasion, Pentagon officials said
two of the high-tech planes were used for the first time in combat
_ each supposedly dropping one 2,000-pound bomb on a field near a
Panamanian Defense Forces barracks to create confusion while U.S.
paratroopers prepared to drop onto a nearby airfield.
   One of the planes actually dropped its bomb some distance away
due to an apparent pilot error, Williams said.
   Defense Department sources have described Cheney as ``livid''
over the lack of information, since it left him touting the
super-sophisticated jet's ``pinpoint accuracy'' in the aftermath of
the Panama invasion.
   The Pentagon held a highly publicized briefing on April 3 to
make public its view that the F-117A Stealth program had been a
success and describe the merits of the plane. At the briefing,
Williams disclosed considerable information that until then had
been classified.
   He said later he was told about the off-target bomb following
that briefing and after he had repeatedly passed on questions about
the plane's peformance to Air Force officials at the urging of a
New York Times reporter who had photos of the off-target bomb
crater.
   Williams explained that the two planes were told to drop their
bombs no closer than 50 meters away from two separate PDF barracks
buildings.
   But due to a last-minute misunderstanding between the pilots,
the second F-117A pilot dropped his bomb on a hillside several
hundred yards away, Williams has confirmed.
   Despite that problem, Williams said Tuesday, Cheney and other
Pentagon officials believe that the jets accomplished their
mission, which was to stun the PDF forces.
   The bombs, including the off-target one, weigh 2,000 pounds and
``shook the ground considerably,'' he said.
   The spokesman said that military officials believe no lives were
lost by the off-target delivery but that the Air Force is looking
into exactly where the bombs landed.
   ``Now we're asking people to go down there and measure where the
bombs landed,'' he said.
   Williams said that Cheney does not believe that he was purposely
misled and is interested in knowing ``when the subsequent
information came to light and why it wasn't passed up'' the chain
of command.

<TEXT>
   Orange harvest prospects are virtually
unchanged from last month, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Production as of April 1 was forecast at 172 million boxes, down
18 percent from 209 boxes last season, primarily because of a
freeze in December.
   Most of the reduction was attributed to a 30 percent decline in
the Florida crop, estimated at 103.1 million boxes against 146.6
million in 1988-89.
   The Texas crop was indicated at 1.2 million boxes, down from
1.85 million in 1988-89. California production, estimated at 66
million boxes, is up from 58.8 million last season, while the
Arizona harvest was indicated at 1.9 million boxes, up from 1.7
million last season.
   Total grapefruit production was forecast at 48.6 million boxes,
down 30 percent from last year, reflecting the freeze in Florida
and Texas.

   Two editors complained Tuesday that
their First Amendment rights of free speech and religion were
violated when they were fired from a small Iowa newspaper for
organizing an anti-abortion group.
   The newspaper defended its actions and a lawyer for the Iowa
Civil Liberties Union said the editors didn't have a First
Amendment case.
   ``I guess my religious convictions are what brought it about,''
Terri Lambertsen, former People Page editor of the Fairfield
Ledger, said in a telephone interview. ``I have to believe that
serving the Lord is more important than my job.''
   The Ledger is a 5,000-circulation, six-day-a-week afternoon
newspaper published about 90 miles southeast of Des Moines.
   Ms. Lambertsen and News Editor John Kennedy were discharged
Monday when they refused to quit as leaders of the Southeast Iowa
Pro-Lifers, a newly-formed anti-abortion group. Ms. Lambertsen is
president and Kennedy is secretary of the group.
   Ledger Editor Jan Nierling said the newspaper was forced to fire
the two to protect its credibility, even though that left the paper
with only a managing editor, a reporter and sports editor.
   ``We take our business seriously. We just think it endangers
incredibly our perception of credibility and objectivity. A
newspaper's credibility is its most valuable asset,'' Ms. Nierling
said.
   The firings prompted a protest sponsored by Refocus Ministries,
a non-denominational ministerial group. About 40 protestors walked
in a circle in front of the Ledger office Tuesday afternoon.
   ``I have to agree with what John Kennedy said,'' said Larry
Rail, co-director of the group. ``He joined a group that is
pro-life. It doesn't mean his views as a newspaper reporter and
editor are going to change. So it's a blatant violation of his
rights.''
   The Ledger's policy is similar to many other news organizations,
according to William Hirschman, president of the Kansas chapter of
the Society of Professional Journalists and the group's Freedom of
Information representative for the region that includes Iowa.
   A common compromise, he said, is to permit reporters to
participate in some groups, but not as spokesmen or leaders, and to
prevent writers from covering events in which they are personally
involved.
   ``I would have hoped that the two sides would have sat down and
discussed it,'' he said.
   Last October, the Milwaukee Journal fired a receptionist, Diane
Dew, for her anti-abortion activities. In December, the paper said
it made a mistake and agreed to pay her a settlement. The Journal
said it had decided that its code of ethics for newsroom employees
did not apply to Ms. Dew.
   Last spring, reporters for The New York Times and The Washington
Post were criticized by their newspapers for participating in an
abortion rights march in Washington. No punitive action was taken
at either paper.
   Kennedy, an eight-year employee of the Ledger, said his
involvement with the anti-abortion group did not interfere with his
newspaper duties. He said the newspaper could send another reporter
to cover an abortion-related story if it felt his objectivity was
compromised.
   Neither Kennedy nor Ms. Lambertsen would say if they planned to
pursue legal remedies.
   ``I've got three kids, aged 4, 6 and 7. My wife works part-time
as a church secretary for $37 a week. I'm not sure yet what we'll
do, but the Lord will take care of us,'' Kennedy said.
   Ms. Nierling said the newspaper has a longstanding policy of
prohibiting reporters from being officers of politically active
groups that receive news coverage.
   ``I'm disappointed that they didn't have a better attitude
toward their professional responsibilities,'' she said.
   Mark Bennett, general counsel for the Iowa Civil Liberties
Union, said the First Amendment was not at issue in the case. The
First Amendment, he said, applies only to governments that try to
infringe religious and speech rights, not to private enterprises,
such as a newspaper.
   An untested theory, he said, would be whether the paper violated
Iowa's civil rights laws, which prohibit discrimination on the
basis of creed.

<HEAD>Better Math Education, Plus Career Counseling Equals More Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Better education plus improved career
counseling is necessary to add to the pool of mathematically
skilled workers who will be needed in the United States by 2000,
the government said Tuesday.
   The National Research Council said the demand for scientists,
engineers and technicians by the turn of the century will exceed
the 1986 level by 36 percent _ nearly double the growth in overall
employment demand.
   Meanwhile, the council said, the college-age population is
expected to decrease 22 percent from 1981 to 1995. The number of
white male students, the traditional pool for scientists and
engineers, will shrink 34 percent.
   ``A Challenge of Numbers,'' the second council report on
mathematics, describes the gap between the projected supply and
demand and the challenge facing the nation's education system.
   The first report, ``Everybody Counts,'' studied trends and needs
in math education.
   Other reports later this year will evaluate post secondary math
curriculum; discuss resources available for math instruction; and
make recommendations on how to ``ensure a healthy flow of
mathematical talent'' into an increasingly technological work force.
   Among the statistics reported Tuesday by the council, an arm of
the National Academy of Sciences, were that:
   _By 1995, eight of the 10 fastest growing professions will be
based on science.
   _Skills in mathematics and a post secondary education will be
needed for a majority of the 21 million new jobs created by the
U.S. economy by 2000.
   _Math enrollments have doubled in the past 20 years, but
two-thirds of the enrollees have been in courses lower than
calculus.
   _The number of students receiving mathematics degrees, those who
could teach, was lower in 1986 than in 1966.
   _The percentage of college students studying math may drop as
the proportion of blacks and Hispanics, who have traditionally
studied math at a lower rate than the general population,
increases. The two groups comprised 22 percent of college students
in 1985; they are expected to account for 30 percent by 2010.
   _Women's interest in advanced mathematics has been low. White
women earn 17 percent of math doctorates compared with 70 percent
by their male counterparts.
   _Non-citizens comprise nearly half the graduate mathematics
population, even as the total number of doctorates awarded has
continued to fall.
   _Three-quarters of math graduates work outside academia, but no
one knows much about what they do. The lack of information ``dulls
the appeal of mathematics as a major and as a profession,'' the
study said.

   A fire feeding on thousands of gallons of
oil at a suburban Milwaukee oil-packing company destroyed the plant
Tuesday and raged out of control for seven hours until a foam spray
cut the flames.
   The fire broke out shortly after 4 a.m. at Harrison Oil Corp. No
workers were inside at the time, and no injuries were reported. One
firefighter was overcome by fumes and heat, and another gashed his
face when he fell.
   Plant Manager Gil Dombek said nearly all of the 50,000 to
100,000 gallons of outboard motor oil and 2,000 to 3,000 gallons of
kerosene were engulfed in the blaze. He also said 150 gallons of a
cattle insecticide were believed to have burned and could have
produced toxic fumes earlier in the morning.
   ``But beyond that, really, there shouldn't be that much toxic in
there,'' Dombek said.
   Firefighters were unable to control the fire until a specialized
truck from Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport was
dispatched and sprayed thousands of gallons of foam on the flames,
said Glendale Fire Chief Norman Wichman.
   ``The foam did a fabulous job. It really cut the fire,'' Wichman
said.
   A huge plume of smoke that billowed from the plant closed a
manufacturer, two schools and a portion of Interstate 43.
   State Department of Natural Resources officials said an unknown
quantity of oil, anti-flame foam and insecticides seeped into the
Milwaukee River, and might kill fish and waterfowl there.

<HEAD>Demand for Corn and Soybeans Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demand for corn and soybeans has picked up a
bit, indicating smaller year-end stockpiles than had been forecast
previously, an Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   The new supply-and-demand analysis said the revisions were in
line with recent figures showing that March 1 corn and soybean
inventories were lower than expected.
   Thus with greater use in the 1989-90 marketing year, Sept. 1
corn inventories are expected to be about 1.33 billion bushels,
down from 1.48 billion forecast a month ago.
   Last Sept. 1, the U.S. corn stockpile was 1.93 billion bushels,
reduced sharply by low yields caused by the 1988 drought. On Sept.
1, 1988, the corn inventory was 4.26 billion bushels.
   Corn prices nationally are expected to average $2.30 to $2.40
per bushel this marketing year, up five cents from the March
forecast but still well below the $2.54 average of the 1988-89
marketing year.
   In 1987-88, before the effects of the drought, corn prices
averaged $1.94 per bushel, the report said.
   On the international level, the report said global trade in corn
and other ``coarse'' grains is expected to be down slightly from
the March forecast, while world production is ``largely unchanged.''
   ``The prospective corn crop in South Africa is up 500,000 tons,
but lower sorghum crops are indicated for Australia and
Argentina,'' the report said.
   Global stockpiles of coarse grain _ which include corn, sorghum,
barley, oats, rye, millet and mixed grains _ are expected to be
down from last month's forcast to their lowest level since 1983-84
because of the reduced U.S. inventory.
   Soybean inventories going into the new marketing year on Sept. 1
were put at 305 million bushels, down from the March forecast of
330 million. However, that would be up from 182 million bushels of
soybeans on hand last Sept. 1.
   The Sept. 1, 1988, soybean stockpile was 302 million bushels.
Marketing year prices averaged $5.88 per bushel in 1987-88 before
soaring to $7.42 in 1988-89.
   With larger production and smaller demand, soybean prices are
expected to average in the range of $5.55 to $5.65 this marketing
year, unchanged from the March forecast.
   Global production of oilseeds, which includes soybeans, was
forecast at a record 213.2 million metric tons, down slightly from
last month but 5 percent more than last year.
   The report showed little change in the wheat supply and demand
for the 1989-90 marketing year that began last June 1.
   Wheat stockpiles are expected to be about 442 million bushels
this June 1, virtually the same as forecast last month. That would
compare with 702 million bushels on hand last June 1 and 1.26
billion bushels on June 1, 1988.
   Nationally, wheat prices were forecast at $3.70 to $3.75 per
bushel this marketing year, down a nickel at the upper end of the
range, compared with $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.

   Express subway service to Kennedy International

   ``It was never really the Train to the Plane,'' said Jared
Lebow, a Transit Authority spokeswoman, referring to an early

   Passengers paid $7.50 to ride the express subway to Howard Beach
in Queens, then special buses to the airport. Lebow said about half
the riders were regular commuters from Howard Beach, not airplane
passengers.
   The transit authority expects to save $7 million in operating

   Fire engulfed a mobile home Tuesday and
killed six children, ranging in age from 9 months to 12 years,
although relatives living nearby rushed to help save the youngsters.
   Their parents escaped with two other children who weren't harmed.
   ``We ran over there to the trailer. My daughter was coming out
the window with the baby,'' said Irene Allen, the victims'
grandmother. ``She fell, but she didn't let the baby fall, she
fell. And I grabbed the baby, and I asked her where the other
children were.''
   ``The smoke was coming into our faces,'' said Lorianne Davis,
mother of the victims. ``My husband jumped out the window in the
bedroom. He was calling me, he said, `Come on, Lori, come on.' but
I went back to try to get them. And then I jumped out. That's when
my leg snapped.''
   Mrs. Davis, 29, was treated for a knee injury and released. Her
husband, Johnnell, 34, was in stable condition at Lady of the Sea
Hospital in Galliano with second-degree burns over 10 percent of
his body, a hospital spokesman said.
   The family had just moved the trailer to the area Monday,
neighbors said. The trailer had no power and was connected by a
single extension cord to another power source. Fire officials said
they were investigating the possibility that the extension cord may
have caused the fire.
   Lafourche Parish Sheriff Duffy J. Breaux identified the dead as
Cassandra Davis, 12; Johnell Davis Jr., 11; Kerry Ann Davis, 10;
Larraine Marie Davis, 6; Laura Davis, 5; Jester Davis, 9 months.

   The government declared Tuesday that its often
bitter relations with Libya will improve as a result of the release
from captivity of a French woman, her daughter and the girl's
father.
   The three were freed Tuesday by the Libyan-backed Palestinian
guerrilla group led by Abu Nidal.
   Previous releases of French hostages prompted complaints from
critics that France barters with terrorists. France has denied such
charges.
   There has been no confirmation of any deals or even direct talks
for the latest releases, but some conservative opposition leaders
view the government's effusive mood toward Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi as suspicious.
   President Francois Mitterrand thanked Gadhafi for ``the
determining role he played in the happy ending of this affair.''
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas praised Gadhafi's ``noble and
humanitarian gesture'' in pressuring Abu Nidal's group to free the
three.
   In return for the releases, Dumas indicated in a statement that
Tripoli could expect to benefit from improved ties with France.
   ``Its real value will be appreciated in the future of relations
between France and Libya,'' Dumas said. He did not elaborate.
   A spokesman for France's conservative Republican Party said it
was ``not useful for Mr. Dumas to send flowers to Gadhafi.''
Ladislav Poniatowski said Libya ``remains, in effect, a way station
for international terrorism.''
   On April 4, Gadhafi called for the release of hostages held in
the Middle East and specifically mentioned the French woman,
Jacqueline Valente.
   She, her daughter Sophie-Liberte, and the girl's father, Fernand
Houtekins, were held for 2{ years by Abu Nidal and his
Fatah-Revolutionary Council. Four other Belgians remain captive.
   It was the second time Gadhafi interceded for the French. He
pressured Abu Nidal's group to free two other daughters of Ms.
Valente in 1988.
   Fatah spokesman Walid Khaled on Tuesday denied assertions the
hostages had been held in Libya. Speaking at a news conference in
Beirut, he said the hostages had been kept in Lebanon, where they
were freed.
   French relations with Gadhafi have see-sawed.
   The latest thaw comes one month after France returned to Libya
three French-made Mirage jet fighters here for repairs since 1986.
Their return was blocked by an embargo imposed when Libya and
France backed opposing sides during a civil war in Chad.
   Relations sunk to a new low in December, when Libya, pressing
for delivery of the aircraft, closed its ports to French ships.
   At the time, Tripoli lambasted Paris on an array of issues,
accusing France of involvement in ``the terrorist plot being
hatched against Lebanon by the imperialist West.'' In a letter to
Mitterrand, Gadhafi accused France of ``oppressing'' Moslems and
claimed the government was allowing Jews to ``use France in a new
war of religion against Islam.''
   However, while railing last month against the United States and
West Germany after a fire at a Libyan plant alleged to produce
chemical weapons, Libya praised France, saying that ``all
misunderstandings have dissipated.''
   Gadhafi expressed hope Tuesday that Middle Easterners detained
in European and American jails would also be freed.

<TEXT>
   An experiment conducted by the Strategic
Defense Initiative program successfully used laser radar to track a
mock decoy warhead last month, officials said on Tuesday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams called the March 29 test ``a
significant milestone'' in the effort to tell real warheads from
decoys in mid-course.
   The need to tell the difference between warheads and decoys is a
key goal of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based
strategic missile defense system popularly known as ``Star Wars.''
   Missiles with decoys could be launched along with nuclear-tipped
missiles to confuse a possible ``Star Wars'' system.
   Program officials, who briefed reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon
about the experiment, said they launched a sub-orbital rocket last
month from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Wallops Island, Va., facility, tracked it to a 300-mile highpoint,
and observed a payload that was ejected.
   The program officials used a laser radar, which is faster than
conventional microwave radar, to track the payload.
   The test made use of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lincoln Laboratory Firepond laser radar located near Westford.,
Mass., officials said.
   ``We've added another tool to help distinguish between warheads
and decoys in a space environment,'' said Col. Raymond Ross, the
director of the sensors and interceptor technology office of SDI.

   A federal judge said Tuesday that regulators
should explain why they slashed the estimated value of financier
Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and other
investments.
   ``The government says it's $2 billion in the red and the former
operator says it's $600 million in the black,'' U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin said. ``I'm in a quandary. Let's get the receiver
in here.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sporkin's suggestion came after Keating testified that Lincoln
was worth $500 million to $700 million when the government seized
it a year ago. The financier is trying to regain control of the
Irvine, Calif., thrift, which was seized by the government along
with its large real estate holdings a year ago.
   James Murphy, an attorney representing the government in its
defense to Keating's suit challenging the takeover, tried to
dissuade the judge.
   He said FDIC reports on Lincoln's status are already court
record.
   Sporkin's suggestion brought broad smiles from Keating and
several associates.
   For months, Keating has claimed that S&amp;L regulators undervalued
Lincoln's investments and were grossly mismangaging them since
taking over the thrift.
   ``Now it looks like we may start cutting through the bull and
start talking real turkey,'' said Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's
son-in-law and the manager of Lincoln's vast real estate holdings.
   Last week, the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,
raised its estimate of the 30-year cost of bailing out bankrupt
thrifts from $257 billion to $300 billion and Comptroller General
Charles Bowsher said the figure could climb to $400 billion or $500
billion if interest rates rise or there is a recession.
   ``I don't think that that the U.S. taxpayer need take that hit,
whatever the number is _ $300 billion, $500 billion _ under a
proper structure for the industry,'' Keating testified Tuesday.
   That structure, according to Keating, would return S&amp;Ls to the
deregulated status they enjoyed from 1982 until 1985 when federal
regulators began reimposing restricitions on thrift investments.
   Keating recounted how the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
criticized his 1984 purchase, using federally insured deposits in
Lincoln, of stock in Gulf Broadcasting Co. He said the regulators
objected, even though the thrift realized a $50 million profit on
the deal 15 months later.
   ``Their criticism was that we might not have made it (the
profit),'' he said. ``We felt we had no downside. There was a
feeding frenzy for media properties at that time. I thought we
could have ended up with a $400 million gain. That was later proven
out by the subsequent liquidation of Gulf's assets.''
   Keating said Lincoln settled for the $50 million profit because
of regulators' resistance to its participation in what was viewed
by some as a hostile takeover attempt against Gulf.
   As an example of the government undervaluing Lincoln assets,
Keating pointed to the luxurious Phoenician Resort that, using the
thrift's funds, he built outside Phoenix at a price tag of $275
million. Lincoln later sold a 45 percent interest in the Phoenician
and another hotel in Phoenix to Kuwait for $170 million.
   Keating estimated that Lincoln's interest in hotel is now worth
$190 million, almost double $99 million asset value listed by
government regulators on their books.
   ``It's a complete misunderstanding of value to write that hotel
down,'' he said. ``Resorts are a highly salable commodity in the
world today. It just hurts me. I think they're going to give it
away,''

<HEAD>California Puts Cigarette Tax Money to Work In Massive
Anti-Smoking Push</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State officials on Tuesday unveiled a
multimillion-dollar ad campaign, financed by a cigarette tax, that
they hope will get 75 percent of California's smokers to quit by
the year 2000.
   Smokers are footing the bill for the $28.6 million propaganda
blitz with tobacco taxes levied under Proposition 99, passed by
California voters last year.
   Beginning Wednesday, anti-smoking ads will waft across
television and radio airwaves and pop up in newspapers and on
billboards throughout the state, said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, head of
the state Department of Health Services.
   The television ads will offer such vignettes as a rap singer
rapping about the dangers of smoking and a group of actors playing
sleazy tobacco executives plotting to addict people to their
product.
   Kizer said the 15-month ad campaign represents by far the
biggest volley ever fired by the anti-smoking camp in its war
against the powerful tobacco industry.
   ``The average state spends about $100,000 a year on anti-tobacco
messages and education,'' he said. ``There is nothing out there
that even comes close to this.''
   But he also cautioned against raising expectations too high,
saying the $28.6 million figure is only a fraction of what the
tobacco industry spends each year on its pro-smoking campaigns.
   ``The 1988 preliminary figures indicate they spent $3.2 billion
for advertising and promotion of tobacco,'' he said.
   Still, Kizer said, he hopes the ad campaign, coupled with
educational efforts, will result in a 20 percent decrease in
smoking by June 1991 and a 75 percent reduction by 2000.
   He said about 24 percent of California's 29 million residents
are smokers.
   Later plans call for dividing $140 million in Proposition 99
funds between public schools and health agencies that would develop
educational programs about the hazards of smoking.
   Kizer acknowledged, however, that the massive anti-smoking
effort could prompt a massive backlash from the well-heeled tobacco
industry.
   ``I think we'll have to just wait and see how they respond,'' he
said. ``If we're successful, if we do what we hope, I think they're
definitely going to respond. But I'm not sure how.''
   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute in
Washington, D.C., said the industry group is also taking a
wait-and-see attitude.
   ``We have not seen the advertisements, we were not shown them in
advance,'' she said. ``But in terms of a counter effort, no, we
have no intentions at this time of interfering with the process.''
   No matter how the industry reacts, Kizer said it's time people
got the truth about tobacco and what it does to one's health.
   Smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease,
stroke, high blood pressure, emphysema and several types of cancer.
   Not only is smoking deadly, Kizer said, but the tobacco
industry's ad campaigns deliberately exploit young people and
immigrant groups who have little information about its hazards.
   Ms. Dawson denied that the industry tries to lure teen-agers,
but said it believes adults should have the right to smoke.

   President Bush named former Assistant Defense
Secretary Richard L. Armitage on Tuesday to represent the United
States in long-delayed talks on the uncertain future of U.S. bases
in the Philippines.
   The selection of Armitage, a specialist on Asian affairs, will
enable negotiations to begin on May 14, U.S. officials said.
   U.S. leases expire next year on Clark Air Base and on Subic
Naval Base _ the two largest U.S. military bases overseas _ and on
four smaller bases.
   The talks will be conducted amid rising rising anti-American
sentiment in the Philippines.
   American officials have said they would like to retain the
bases, but are prepared to abandon them if the opposition is
overwhelming or the price for new leases too high.
   Armitage, 44, is a former assistant defense secretary for
international affairs.
   In announcing the appointment, presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. military bases in the Philippines
``contribute to the security of the Philippines, the United States
and other countries in the region.''
   It is the third high-level job over the past year that Armitage
has been offered. Bush first selected Armitage to be assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, but Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney prevailed on him to stay in the Defense
Department.
   Then, Bush selected Armitage to be army secretary. But before
the nomination could acted on by the Senate, Armitage withdrew his
name and left government service in June 1989, saying he wanted to
spend more time with his family.
   In his Defense Department job, a position he held throughout the
Reagan administration, Armitage played a major role in
policy-making in the Persian Gulf, the ouster of Philippine leader
Ferdinand Marcos and in overseeing foreign military assistance
programs.
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Philippines have agreed to proceed with the talks and that
Armitage's longtime knowledge of Asia would help get the
negotiations moving.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has expressed unhappiness
over a $96 million cut Congress made in the Bush administration's
request of $360 million to compensate the Philippines for the use
of the sites.
   Preliminary talks on the bases had been scheduled to start last
December, but were put off after a coup attempt against the Aquino
government.
   Some Philippine political leaders have suggested that the United
States pay annual fees upwards of $2 billion to renew the leases _
a price U.S. officials have suggested is too steep.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins In Second McMartin Pre-School Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)_ The second trial of Raymond Buckey in the
McMartin Pre-School molestation case began Tuesday after the
defendant received an extra lawyer and nearly 300 prospective
jurors were summoned.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg convened court in the jury
assembly room rather than the courtroom because of the large number
of prospects.
   After he told the 287 panelists that Buckey's trial would last
at least through the year, all but 90 indicated it would be a
hardship to serve so long.
   The 90 who did not claim a hardship were given questionnaires to
determine how much they knew about the case and whether they had
opinions about Buckey's guilt or innocence. The others were given
questionnaires to determine whether they should be dismissed
because of hardship.
   Jury selection began after a court session to resolve a dispute
over delays caused by a back problem suffered by Buckey's longtime
attorney, Danny Davis.
   Davis says he suffers from a herniated spinal disk and had
previously sought a delay in the case to have back surgery. On
Monday he agreed to try proceeding but jury selection never got
under way.
   He hobbled into court Tuesday leaning heavily on a cane. He said
he reinjured a chronic back problem last weekend and is undergoing
physical therapy.
   Attorney John Wagner, who represented Buckey's sister in a
successful fight to win back her teaching credentials, was named
co-counsel to help Davis through the trial.
   The 31-year-old Buckey has been a defendant for nearly seven
years. He was acquitted of 40 molestation charges Jan. 18, and his
mother was acquitted of 12 charges. But prosecutors decided to
retry Buckey on eight counts unresolved by the jury.
   The first trial of Buckey and his mother lasted nearly three
years and cost $13 million _ the longest, costliest criminal trial
in U.S. history.

   Three Northwest Airlines pilots accused of
flying while intoxicated pleaded innocent in federal court on
Tuesday.
   U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd set a trial date of June 11 for
Capt. Norman Prouse, 1st Officer Robert Kirchner and flight
engineer Joseph Balzer. U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum will
preside over the trial.
   The pilots were arrested at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport on
March 8 following a dawn flight from Fargo, N.D. They were accused
of drinking at a Fargo bar late the night before.
   Northwest fired the three, and the Federal Aviation
Administration revoked their licenses.
   Felony indictments for operating a common carrier under the
influence of alcohol were returned April 4 against Prouse, of
Conyers, Ga.; Kirchner, of Highland Ranch, Colo.; and Balzer, of
Antioch, Tenn.
   A single trial is scheduled, although the attorney for Balzer
said he would try to get his client a separate trial.
   The three face misdemeanor charges in North Dakota and are
scheduled to appear in Cass County Court in Fargo on Thursday.

<HEAD>Senators Ask Sullivan To Overturn Rule On Disabled Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen senators are asking Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to overturn a new rule that could
deny Medicaid benefits to some of the disabled poor.
   In a letter to Sullivan, the senators said the rule that took
effect in January ``nullifies due process rights'' of these
Americans.
   The regulation would require most states to adopt the decision
of the Social Security Administration as to whether an individual
is disabled, and it would give Social Security 90 days rather than
60 days to decide.
   HHS estimated the rule would save $5 million annually, but the
department said the purpose of the regulation is not to save money,
since the savings are a small part of the $80 billion-a-year
program. Rather, HHS says the changes will make the Medicaid
program more efficient and effective.
   Previously, states could grant Medicaid coverage to low-income,
disabled people even if the Social Security Administration
determined that they were not disabled. Some states are more
flexible than SSA in determining disability.
   Under the new rule, an individual who is determined by SSA not
to be disabled may not apply to the state for Medicaid on the
ground of disability for one year after that decision, except in
certain circumstances.
   The senators, led by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., noted in their
March 15 letter that a recent report by the General Accounting
Office, Congress' investigatory arm, concluded more than half of
the applicants denied disability benefits by SSA should have been
granted those benefits.

<TEXT>
   Rival gangs of prisoners fought
each other with knives and sharpened iron rods in a western
Venezuela prison on Tuesday and six inmates were killed in the
three-hour fracas, the warden said.
   Warden Miguel Garcia said by telephone that two other prisoners
were badly wounded before calm was restored at Santa Ana
penitentiary.
   Garcia said the battle was touched off ``by old feuds for
leadership in the prison.''
   The official news agency Venpres earlier described it as a
revolt.
   The warden said that hundreds fought in the battle between the
Llaneros, from the Venezuelan plains regions, and the Colombianos,
from neighboring Colombia.
   ``At some point, it appeared to involve everybody in the
penitentiary,'' Garcia said.
   During the melee, one of the fighting groups took eight prison
officials hostage, including the prison director, Col. Edilio
Hernandez.
   ``All of them were released unhurt,'' Garcia said.
   The penitentiary in San Cristobal, near the border with Colombia
and about 500 miles from Caracas, is one of the biggest in
Venezuela, holding about 2,200 inmates.
   An early report said the fight had broken out as a protest
against the arrival of new inmates in the already overcrowded
prison.
   It began at midmorning in a basketball court during a recreation
period, according to Cpl. Jose Orlando Roldan of San Cristobal
police.
   He said National Guardsmen had surrounded the prison.
   Warden Garcia said the six inmates stabbed to death belonged to
the Llaneros gang, while the two injured convicts were members of
the Colombianos. He gave no names.

   The Soviet Union's second-ranking
diplomat in Suriname was found shot to death in a gutter Tuesday in
this South American capital, police said.
   No group or individual claimed responsibility for the killing,
and the motive was unknown.
   The body of Stasis Obukauskas, 41, second secretary and consul
in the Soviet Embassy, was found with three bullet wounds in the
head, said Inspector Ronald Gayadhar, a police spokesman.
   Police said Obukauskas' body was in a gutter along Kennedy
Highway, the main road between Paramaribo and Zanderij
International Airport.
   Obukauskas had been in Suriname for about 2{ years. There was no
comment from the Soviet Embassy. A man who answered the telephone
there Tuesday afternoon said the embassy was closed.
   A preliminary examination indicated Obukauskas was shot at about
1 a.m. Tuesday, police said.
   A blue Mazda was found abandoned nearby, police said. Obukauskas
usually drove a brown Mercedes.
   Gayadhar said the body was found by motorists who noticed the
Mazda parked partly on the highway. He said there were no bullet
holes or blood stains on the vehicle, which did not have diplomatic
plates.
   It was the first time a diplomat has been murdered in Suriname.
In June, a Soviet diplomat was found hanging at his home and the
death was ruled a suicide.
   Suriname, a former Dutch colony with a population of 400,000,
has been governed by a nominal civilian government headed by
President Ramsewak Shankar since 1988. The country previously was
ruled by army strongman Desi Bouterse, who is now the armed forces
chief and continues to wield power behind the scenes.
   Under the banner of the Jungle Commando, Bush Negro militants
have been waging a guerrilla war on and off since August 1986.
   Suriname gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975. It is
the only Dutch-speaking country in South America.

   The prospect of improved relations between
France and Libya after the release of three European hostages drew
expressions of concern and dismay from U.S. officials Tuesday.
   ``France is being nicer to Libya than we think they should be,''
said one U.S. official. ``We think people should be keeping the
pressure on Libya.''
   The officials stopped short of accusing France of making a deal
with Libya for the release of the hostages, one of whom is a French
citizen.
   Jacqueline Valente, 32, her Belgian husband and their 2-year-old
daughter were released Tuesday after 2{ years of captivity.
   In Paris, there was no confirmation of any deal.
   The officials, who spoke on the condition they not be named,
said the United States would prefer that France and other countries
insist that Libya expel Palestinian leader Abu Nidal and his
followers and stop its alleged efforts to make chemical weapons.
   Abu Nidal's group, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, arranged for
the transfer of the hostages to French officials in Beirut.
   The release came a month after France returned three French-made
Mirage jet fighters to Libya. The planes had been in France for
repairs since 1986. The return of the planes was blocked by an
embargo imposed when Libya and France backed opposing sides during
the civil war in Chad.
   The French government thanked Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
for his role in the release and said relations with Libya would
improve. Gadhafi last week called for the release of hostages as a
humanitarian gesture.
   The U.S. officials said American diplomats have told the French
they have strong opposition to negotiating with terrorists.
   ``Libya continues to host the Abu Nidal organization and provide
it with support. We have repeatedly called on Libya to expel this
group and end Libyan support for terrorism,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   As for Gadhafi, Ms. Tutwiler said, ``people everywhere should do
what they can to end the barbaric practice of hostage taking. Basic
civilized behavior requires nothing less.''
   Ms. Tutwiler noted that the 18 American and other Western
hostages in Lebanon are being held by pro-Iranian groups and
reaffirmed U.S. opposition to negotiating with hostage-takers.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was quoted
Tuesday as saying he will run for president in the next election.
   The report by the government news agency PAP could not
immediately be confirmed with Walesa or his spokesman. Aides and
colleagues of the Solidarity leader have long been saying he is
considering a presidential bid.
   Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a close associate of Walesa's and editor of
the Solidarity Weekly newspaper, said the leader's comments to PAP
should only be ``understood as a general declaration, not connected
with present events.''
   ``I confirm,'' PAP quoted Walesa as saying when asked if he
would run for president. ``We have many wise and valuable people in
government, holding various posts. However, one must speed up the
pace of reforms and destroy the old arrangements.''
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the general and former Communist
Party leader elected by Parliament in July, officially is to serve
a six-year term until 1995.
   However, there is widespread belief that the next presidential
election will be moved up as part of an overhaul of the Polish
Constitution.
   The most likely time for elections appears to be spring 1991,
when Poland would be marking the 200th anniversary of its first
written constitution.
   Nothing in his remarks on PAP indicated when Walesa thought the
election might be, and Kaczynski suggested the leader was not
talking about an immediate presidential campaign.
   ``Nobody is talking about the date for elections or about
starting any procedures,'' he said. ``He just states the certain
fact'' that he will run when Jaruzelski leaves offices.
   ``This should be understood as a general declaration, not
connected with current events,'' Kaczynski added.
   Kaczynski said Walesa is committed to winning re-election as
Solidarity's chairman next week, when the union holds its first
national congress in nine years.
   ``I will run in the election and you know that when I run I want
to win,'' Walesa told the Solidarity Executive Commission on
Tuesday in Gdansk. ``And I count on your support.''
   Walesa is expected to be challenged by union members who feel
Solidarity has strayed from its ideals of 1980, putting politics
ahead of trade-union goals like defending workers' interests. A
long-time Walesa critic, Marian Jurczyk of Szczecin, has formed a
rival faction called Solidarity '80.
   Jaruzelski was elected president at a time when Poland was the
only East bloc country to have a legal opposition and to be making
such bold moves toward democracy.
   Jaruzelski was to serve as a guarantee to the Soviet Union and
Poland's Warsaw Pact allies that Poland would do nothing to upset
the East bloc alliance.
   However, that purpose has changed with the fall of communists
from power in all six Warsaw Pact countries except the Soviet
Union. More radical reformers in Poland feel it is time to oust
Jaruzelski in order to speed up changes in the country.
   Jaruzelski also has his advocates in the Solidarity-led
government and Parliament. They feel that as president, he has
behaved with restraint and shown good cooperation with Solidarity
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Elections now would be a divisive distraction from coping with
the country's pressing economic problems, they say.

<TEXT>
   International pilots will be warned that
safety in the skies over seven U.S. cities is critically deficient
due to a change in air traffic control rules, the Air Line Pilots
Association announced Tuesday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which changed the rules two
years ago, defended the procedures, saying they have brought ``no
accidents and no close calls.''
   Airspace over Charlotte, N.C., Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los
Angeles, Memphis, Philadelphia and Phoenix was added to the
international ``black star'' list of airports and airspace that
could pose problems for pilots.
   Only one other U.S. site is among 23 other locations on the list
_ the Cyril E. King International Airport in St. Thomas, U.S.
Virgin Islands. Surrounding terrain requires special training and
no night flights, according to pilot groups.
   ALPA announced the new list after the International Federation
of Air Line Pilots Associations added the seven U.S. airspaces to
its list.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the pilots' complaints arise from
a test that has been going on since 1987 in Terminal Control Areas
over the seven airports.
   In 20 other sectors over major U.S. airports, controllers must
maintain a separation of three miles between all aircraft. At the
seven cities, Farrar said, controllers under limited circumstances
need not comply with any set separation between aircraft as long as
they are kept safely apart.
   The new standard, called ``conflict resolution,'' has been used
in the vast airspaces between airports for six years, Farrar said,
also without any accidents or close calls.
   The ``conflict resolution'' procedure is only allowed during
clear weather when one plane is flying by instruments and the pilot
of the second plane is relying on what he sees out the window,
Farrar said.
   ALPA said the ``black star'' designation, formally known as the
Critically Deficient list, does not indicate unsafe conditions but
is viewed as ``a serious deficiency in our nation's aviation safety
structure'' about which unfamiliar pilots should be warned.
   ``The added risks, coupled with the inability to measure any
gains in efficiency, make this a highly questionable exercise by
the FAA,'' said ALPA President Henry Duffy.
   He said the FAA benefits from the new system because it reduces
the number of reportable operational errors, making the skies
appear to be safer. No longer do all violations of the three-mile
separation have to be reported, he said.

   State troopers stormed an
apartment building in southeastern Brazil on Tuesday, killing a
gunman who had been holding a woman and her baby hostage, police
said. Two other kidnappers were killed earlier.
   ``The hostages are in perfect health,'' said Capt. Hermann
Silveira from Vitoria, a city 315 miles north of Rio de Janeiro.
   Silveira said the two accomplices died after they were wounded
in a shootout while trying to flee. He said police then decided to
storm the building because they feared for the hostages' lives.
   The episode began Sunday night, when the three armed men drove
past a Vitoria bar and riddled it with bullets, Silveira said. No
one was reported injured.
   Military police in Vitoria say the three gunmen had connections
with organized crime and were probably involved in a mob hit.
   On Monday, police found the men at the apartment building where
they lived. But the suspects spotted the officers and took their
two neighbors hostage, Silveira said.

<TEXT>
   Half of America has already stood up to be
counted.
   The Census Bureau reported Tuesday that the response rate for
its 1990 national head count has reached 50 percent.
   ``We expect the number to grow,'' said spokeswoman Paulette
Lichtman-Panzer, noting that the halfway mark was reached last
Friday.
   And that response rate counted only forms that have been
``logged in'' by census offices across the nation, she said. Many
places have a backlog of returns waiting to be checked in.
   The Bureau mailed out 88 million forms on March 23 and hand
delivered an additional 11 million to homes where proper mailing
addresses could not be obtained.
   In addition, census takers are working with postal officials to
correct problems in several communities where forms could not be
delivered for one reason or another, officials said.
   ``If anyone has put off answering the census, now's the time to
do so,'' said Lichtman-Panzer, stressing the need to increase the
mail response rate.
   Census officials have told Congress that they hope for a 70
percent response rate. Sending workers out to count those who do
not answer the mailed request costs an estimated $10 million for
every percentage point, officials have estimated.
   Census offices will begin sending out workers April 26 to homes
where no form has been sent back, said Lichtman-Panzer.
   They will try to interview the residents to get the necessary
information. In some cases, she pointed out, homes are vacant or
may have been torn down, resulting in no form being returned.
   While half the census forms are now back, tabulating the
information they contain will take months.
   The first results of the census, population totals for each
state, will be reported on Dec. 31 and more detailed information
will follow after the first of the year.
   The total cost of the census is expected to reach $2.5 billion.
   The national head count is conducted every 10 years. It is
required by the Constitution to produce population totals used in
reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives. In addition,
census population totals are used in dividing up billions of
dollars in federal funds for state and local governments.

   The ruling Sandinistas said Tuesday
new fighting could break out because an agreement between the newly
elected government and Contra rebels failed to set a deadline for
the rebels to disarm.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada and the pro-Sandinista
daily El Nuevo Diario ran editorials and stories dismissing the
accord as a rebel ploy to gain time and influence before the April
25 change of government. The accord was reached Monday.
   They also accused the rebels and the United National Opposition
of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of trying to take
over the Sandinista People's Army.
   ``The People Ask That The EPS Act!!!,'' said El Nuevo Diario in
a front-page headline, referring to the Sandinista army by its
Spanish initials. It added in a subhead: ``Either The Contra Is
Wiped Out or They'll Wipe Out Everything.''
   Outgoing leftist President Daniel Ortega, defeated by Mrs.
Chamorro in elections Feb. 25, was quoted by El Nuevo Diario as
saying that the Contras, in collusion with ``extremist sectors'' of
the pro-U.S. United National Opposition, were adopting a hard line
about demobilizing.
   This, Ortega was quoted as saying, ``is a point that worries us
and obliges us to maintain ourselves alert.''
   In an editorial titled ``The First Test of the New Government,''
Barricada said ``there is nothing to discuss with the Contras,''
save their demobilization by April 25. That is when Mrs. Chamorro
takes office for a six-year term.
   ``The intransigent attitude assumed by some Contra ringleaders
and extremist (UNO) politicians ... is placing the nation in a very
dangerous situation,'' the editorial said.
   ``Unless this situation is resolved in the briefest term ... all
the efforts for peace and reconciliation could ... revert into a
fresh outbreak of the war,'' the editorial added.
   Barricada's editorials are considered the official Sandinista
party line.
   The war between the Contras and the Sandinistas has killed an
estimated 30,000 people since it began in 1981, two years after the
Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that toppled rightist
dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   An estimated 9,000 Contras based in Honduras have moved back to
Nicaragua.
   On Monday, negotiators for the Contras and UNO said rebels in
camps at Yamales, in the Honduran jungle near the Nicaraguan
border, would be the first to turn in their weapons. They said the
surrender of weapons would begin April 18.
   A contingent of 170 Venezuelan troops arrived Tuesday in
Honduras to strengthen a United Nations force of observers, who are
to supervise the disbandment in Honduras and Nicaragua.
   Gen. Agustin Quesada Gomez, their Spanish commander, said
Venezuela will send a total of 700 soldiers. They will be joined by
troops from several other countries.
   The observers will supervise the disarmament of the rebels at
Yamales and the concentration of Contras in predetermined ``safety
zones'' inside Nicaragua once the U.N. peacekeeping force can
ensure a cease-fire.
   Monday's accord in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, also calls for a
Contra commission to go to Managua before April 18 ``to speed up
the demobilization'' but it did not set a deadline for completion.
   Contra leaders have been issuing conflicting signals, saying
they would demobilize in support of Mrs. Chamorro's new government,
but also saying they do not trust the Sandinistas.
   Forcing the Contras to demobilize by April 25 would amount to a
moral victory for the Sandinistas. But none of the accords the
rebels signed requires them to disband by that date.

   Twentieth Century Fox has lifted its ban against
critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, who gave harsh reviews of a
recent Fox film.
   The studio said three weeks ago that Ebert and Siskel would be
barred indefinitely from preview screenings after both critics said
on a television talk show that the comedy ``Nuns on the Run''
wasn't funny.
   But Siskel called Fox shortly before a Monday screening of
another Fox film and asked if he was still unwelcome.
   It was the first Fox screening here since ``Nuns on the Run.''
   The ban was over, a company spokesman said, and Siskel went to
the show. Ebert didn't know about the lifting of the ban and was
out of town.
   ``I'm happy the ban is lifted,'' Ebert said. ``I feel
vindicated. In the future I will continue to review Fox films in
the same evenhanded way I have in the past.
   ``The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I had predicted
the ban would last only one film and Roger had predicted it would
last none,'' Siskel said. ``Roger was right and he's going to be
hard to deal with when he gets home.''
   The two appear on ``Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; The Movies,'' a syndicated
half-hour television show.

<HEAD>Houston Firm Agrees To Divest Diamond Drill Bit Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houston firm agreed to divest its diamond
drill bit business to avoid a Justice Department antitrust suit
over its proposed $550 million purchase of a Salt Lake City
company, according to court papers filed Tuesday.
   The Justice Department simultaneously filed the antitrust suit
challenging the proposed acquisition of Eastman Christensen Co. of
Salt Lake City by Baker Hughes Inc. of Houston, along with a
consent decree settling the suit.
   Diamond drill bits are used to drill for oil and gas, and both
companies are large, diversified suppliers of a wide variety of oil
field products and services.
   The two companies are major manufacturers of three types of
diamond drill bits: natural diamond bits; synthetic diamond bits
called polycrystalline diamond compact bits; and thermally stable
synthetic polycrystalline diamond bits.
   In the United States last year, sales of the three types of
diamond drill bits totaled more than $30 million. Baker Hughes
accounted for about 15 percent, or $4.6 million, and Eastman
Christensen accounted for about 25 percent, or $7.7 million,
according to the Justice Department.
   Worldwide, Baker Hughes earned about $18 million of its total
sales of $2.3 billion from its diamond drill bit business, the
department said. For Eastman Christensen, worldwide diamond drill
bit sales accounted for $35 million of its $211 million total sales.
   The antitrust suit filed in U.S. District Court in the District
of Columbia alleged that the proposed acquisition would hamper
competitiveness in the U.S. market for those three types of drill
bits.
   ``The divestiture will ensure that the merger of Baker Hughes
and Eastman Christensen will not raise the cost of drilling for oil
and gas in the United States,'' James F. Rill, assistant attorney
general in charge of the antitrust division, said in a statement.
   Under the consent decree, Baker Hughes must divest its entire
diamond drill bit business, including foreign and domestic
facilities, by Aug. 6, or a trustee will be appointed to carry out
the divestiture, the department said.
   Baker Hughes' diamond drill bit business includes its patents,
manufacturing facilities in Houston; Aberdeen, Scotland; and
Escobar, Argentina; and a research and development center.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, are helping
to promote an upcoming TV cartoon that will feature an anti-drug
message for children.
   The White House, making the announcement during Bush's trip to
Canada, said Tuesday that the Bushes taped a public service ad
promoting the special, ``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.''
   The animated show will be simultaneously aired April 21 by ABC,
NBC and CBS _ a first in programming. It also will be shown on
cable. The commercial will run before the program.
   The program features Bugs Bunny, Alf, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, Winnie the Pooh, the Smurfs, Garfield, Daffy Duck and
other cartoon characters.
   In the message, Mrs. Bush calls the program ``the powerful story
of a teen-ager dealing with drug and alcohol abuse'' and tells
children to ``make the right decision _ stay away from drugs and
alcohol.''
   ``Some of your favorite cartoon characters are going to help you
understand how drug and alcohol can ruin your life,'' the president
says. ``So, watch the program. Talk about it with your family.''

<HEAD>Severe Thunderstorms in South-Central, Rain Across East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain and storms stretched from Texas to New England on Tuesday
after a night of thunderstorms and tornadoes that caused damage and
one death in the southern Plains.
   Thunderstorms moving out of the central High Plains into the
lower and middle Mississippi Valley produced severe weather during
the night in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas, the
National Weather Service said.
   In Oklahoma, severe storms killed the pilot of a small plane,
injured at least five people and damaged more than a dozen houses
late Monday and early Tuesday.
   Much of the damage came when a tornado cut a swath from Lone
Grove to Ardmore. Ten houses and five mobile homes were damaged and
a barn was tossed into the middle of a city street, authorities
said.
   Also in Oklahoma, Cherokee and Haskell county officials reported
60 mph winds early Tuesday, and officials said power lines were
blown down near the Haskell County town of Kinta. Kiowa County
reported 65-mph winds south of Snyder.
   A storm in Rogers County, Okla., had ``lots of lightning ...
blinding rain,'' said Sheriff Buck Johnson. He said the wind blew
his van into a ditch while he was driving to the site of the fatal
plane crash.
   Strong thunderstorms produced large hail and damaging winds
across parts of northern Texas early Tuesday, along with at least
one report of a tornado. Hail almost the size of golf balls was
reported in Gainesville, with wind up to 60 mph tearing roofs from
several homes and breaking windows, the weather service said.
   Thunderstorms spawned several tornadoes in south-central Kansas
late Monday, the weather service said. Hail as big as baseballs was
reported east of Halmstead, Kan.
   Heavier rainfall totals overnight included 2.65 inches at
Wesley, Ark., 2.28 inches at Joplin, Mo., and 2.25 inches at
Grandfield, Okla.
   Tuesday afternoon, rain developed along and ahead of a cold
front stretching from south central Texas to New England.
Thunderstorms with locally heavy rain extended from southeastern
Texas to western Kentucky.
   Light snow fell on northern Maine. A winter storm watch was in
effect into Wednesday.
   Light snow also was reported in Wyoming, Nebraska and the
Dakotas.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 20s and lower 30s from
the northern high Plains to northern Minnesota.
   Temperatures early Tuesday dipped below freezing in the Great
Basin that includes Nevada and western Utah, and from the northern
and central Rockies to Upper Michigan. Readings dropped below 20
degrees overnight in Montana and western North Dakota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 22
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 91 at Gila Bend, Ariz.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 4 degrees in Cut Bank.

<TEXT>
   The Libyan-backed Palestinian group headed by Abu
Nidal freed a French woman, a Belgian man and their young daughter
Tuesday after holding them for nearly 2{ years.
   The three arrived to the cheers of a crowd of relatives and
French officials at a military airport outside Paris late Tuesday
after a five-hour flight from Beirut. They had been dropped off at
the French Embassy in the morning by masked gunmen who arrived in
cars with drawn curtains.
   Jacqueline Valente, 32, Fernand Houtekins, 43, and their
2-year-old daughter Sophie-Liberte, born in captivity, made no
public statements though the couple smiled as they got off the
plane. They were taken to a military hospital to spend their first
night in freedom after 882 days' captivity.
   Abu Nidal's group announced Nov. 8, 1987, it had seized the
hostages from the French yacht Silco in the Mediterranean off the
Gaza Strip. It accused them of collaborating with Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency. Friends said the group was on a holiday cruise.
   The French government thanked Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
for his role in the release and said relations with Libya would
improve. Gadhafi last week called for the release of hostages as a
humanitarian gesture.
   President Bush, in Toronto, said he didn't know enough about the
release to say whether Gadhafi deserves any credit.
   ``We've got some major differences with Libya that continue to
exist, but look, who am I to argue in this case if someone can help
free one hostage? ... Give that person credit,'' Bush said.
   The hostages, released by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, used
an executive jet in Beirut provided by the French government to fly
to Villacoublay near Paris. Ms. Valente was the first to disembark,
followed by Houtekins, holding their daughter in his arms. All
appeared healthy.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council has been blamed for scores of
terrorist acts, including the December 1985 attacks on Rome and
Vienna airports that killed more than 20 people.
   Because the hostages were believed to have been held in Libya,
the case is considered unrelated to the 18 Westerners, including
eight Americans, held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
factions.
   However, Fatah spokesman Walid Khaled denied assertions that the
hostages had been held in Libya. Speaking at a news conference in
Beirut, he said the hostages had been kept in Lebanon.
   The State Department welcomed the release and called for freeing
of other captives.
   However, U.S. officials in Washington were critical of France's
warm words for Gadhafi. The officials, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said France and other countries should press Libya to
expel Abu Nidal and his group and stop alleged efforts to make
chemical weapons.
   ``France is being nicer to Libya than we think they should be,''
said one U.S. official.
   The release came a month after France returned to Libya three
French-made Mirage jet fighters that had been in France for repairs
since 1986. The return of the planes was blocked by an embargo
imposed when Libya and France backed opposing sides during the
civil war in Chad.
   In December, Libya, pressing for delivery of the aircraft,
closed its ports to French ships.
   Gadhafi said Tuesday that Abu Nidal's group was ``distancing''
itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing the hostages,
Libya's official news agency JANA reported.
   Last week, Gadhafi urged the release of hostages in the Middle
East as a gesture for Ramadan, the Islamic holy month. He singled
out Ms. Valente.
   Gadhafi has supported Abu Nidal, who along with some of his
followers has been convicted of terrorist attacks abroad. The
Libyan leader is believed to have allowed him to live near the
Libyan capital, Tripoli.
   Houtekins said after his release that four members of his family
still held by the terrorist group are well.
   ``They have morale. They are holding firm,'' he said, adding,
``We expected our freedom, we knew it was coming one day. The day
of our freedom has arrived. For those who stay behind, we keep
hoping.''
   ``I embrace all my family. I am well, and the little one also,''
Ms. Valente told French reporters.
   Only two French news organizations were given access to the
hostages.
   The hostages refused to discuss conditions of their captivity or
where they were held. They did not mention a second child born in
captivity in 1989.
   French Ambassador Rene Ala said Ms. Valente told him the boy
died recently of problems with his digestive system.
   A police spokesman said French officials ``apparently had
advance notice of the release. Ala was waiting at a cement outpost
manned by French Marine guards near the main gate'' of the West
Beirut compound.
   In Beirut, the Fatah-Revolutionary spokesman said, ``Direct
talks between our movement and the French side have resulted in an
agreement on their release.'' Khaled did not elaborate.
   There was no evidence of any deal, but French President Francois
Mitterrand personally thanked Gadhafi for ``the determining role he
played in the happy ending of this affair.''
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas praised what he called Gadhafi's
``noble'' gesture.
   ``(The release's) real value will be appreciated in the future
of relations between France and Libya,'' Dumas said without
elaborating.
   In Brussels, Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said he hoped the
release ``can be considered as a testimony of good faith concerning
the release of the other'' hostages.
   The Abu Nidal group still holds Houtekins' brother Emmanuel, and
Emmanuel's wife and teen-age daughter and son.
   The group linked freedom for them to the release of Nasser
Sa'eed, a Palestinian serving a life term in Belgium for a June
1980 grenade attack on Jewish youths in Antwerp.
   The Belgian government has not responded to the offer.
   Two other daughters of Ms. Valente were freed as a result of
Libyan intervention on Dec. 29, 1988.
   In France, Jacqueline's mother Brigitte Valente said Tuesday:
``The nightmare is over and I'm trembling with joy. I can't even
talk. It's too beautiful.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday he and
senior government advisers will agree before the end of the week on
a much-anticipated program of radical economic reform.
   He said he wants to quicken the pace for overhauling the economy.
   His announcement came as senior Soviet officials debate whether
to initiate Polish-style economic shock therapy here that would
free prices and sharply increase unemployment while slashing the
value of the ruble.
   The officials have cautioned, however, that the government will
be able to go only as fast as angry and disillusioned consumers
allow.
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev told a congress of the Komsomol Communist
youth group, ``Analyzing the situation, we came to the conclusion
that it is necessary to speed up economic reform. Already this year
and at the beginning of next year, we will take the basic steps in
this direction that were planned for 1992-1993.''
   Gorbachev said the Presidential Council and the Council of the
Federation _ two new advisory groups formed after he took office
last month as the country's first executive president _ will meet
Saturday to decide on proposals from government ministers to put
reforms into effect.
   Soviet leaders want to boost industrial production and remedy
perennial shortages of a range of consumer goods.
   Gorbachev said the proposals will be presented for public debate
before they go into effect. He did not go into particulars.
   One day earlier, Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin dodged questions
on the details of economic reform at a news conference, creating
the impression the government still had not decided many questions.
   Abalkin also said public worries about rising prices and
unemployment were a key factor.
   ``A speedy transition to a market economy will come up against
powerful opposition,'' he said.
   ``What we must do first is to make all people understand and see
clearly that without such a transition the country has no future as
a highly developed great power,'' Abalkin said.
   In Bonn, West Germany, on Monday, the Soviets pledged in an
international accord to support free-market economic policies. The
Soviet economy is now stalled somewhere between central planning
and free markets.
   On Tuesday, the Soviets asked the Western nations in Bonn for
the Conference on Economic Cooperation in Europe to ease limits on
the sale of high-technology goods to the Soviet Union.

   President Bush on Tuesday complimented Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi for an apparently positive role in the
release of three European hostages but said major differences with
Libya remain.
   Bush said he didn't know if the release had implications for
U.S. hostages being held, but called anew for their release as ``a
manifestation of good will.''
   The president, during a question-and-answer session with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, was asked about the action
by a Libyan-backed Palestinian group in freeing a French woman, a
Belgian man and their young daughter Tuesday after holding them for
nearly 2{ years.
   The three arrived in Paris on Tuesday after a five-hour flight
from Beirut, where they had been dropped off at the French Embassy
by masked gunmen.
   Gadhafi last week called for the release of hostages as a
humanitarian gesture.
   ``Look, who am I to argue on this case? If somebody can help
free one hostage, any person held against his or her will, give
that person credit,'' Bush said.
   ``A person deserves credit for facilitating the release of
people held against their will anywhere in the world, I would
certainly say fine, give the person credit,'' Bush said, while
saying he didn't ``know enough about the facts of this release.''
   ``If this individual, Col. Gadhafi, had a part in it, I would
say that's very positive. But we've got some major diffences with
Libya that continue to exist,'' Bush said.
   The president said said he did not know whether the release
``has any implications at all'' as it related to the eight U.S.
hostages in Lebanon, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who has been held more than
five years.
   ``A few weeks ago, there was a flurry of understandable
excitement about the release of these people,'' Bush said. ``And I
had difficulty understanding where was all this coming from? What's
driving this news flurry?''
   ``And I still don't know the answer to that.''
   But, he added, ``I would just repeat that good will begets good
will. And a manifestation of good will would be the rlease of these
American hostages.''

<TEXT>
   Police searched files of known
arsonists Tuesday and explored the black shell of the ferry
Scandinavian Star for clues to the fire that killed about 200
people _ two years after there was a blaze on board the same vessel.
   Investigators in Sweden's west coast port of Lysekil said entire
decks were burned of everything combustible, and it may be
impossible to pinpoint physical evidence on how the weekend fire
began.
   In Oslo, Norwegian police who took charge of the case said they
were looking for one or more arsonists, but added that the firebug
could have been among the victims of the flames that engulfed the
10,500-ton ship en route from Norway to Denmark.
   Allan Pollock, spokesman for the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board, said Tuesday in Washington that the vessel's owners
failed to respond to any of the board's recommendations after a
non-fatal March 15, 1988, engine-room fire on the Scandinavian Star
off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   The chairman of the NTSB, James Kolstad, said, ``It is ironic
that many of the problems the board cited in its investigation of a
fire aboard the same vessel two years ago are being reported by
survivors of the North Sea fire.''
   Kolstad, in an interview Tuesday, said he was sending an
investigator to act as an observer in the investigation.
   An American entertainer on the ship, Ruth E. Rome of East
Lansing, Mich., was among the presumed dead.
   After the first fire, the board recommended increased crew
training, more life vests on the deck, smoke detectors,
modifications to prevent smoke from traveling through air
ventilation systems and other steps to improve safety.
   The Danish-based Da-No Line bought the 20-year-old Scandinavian
Star last month from SeaEscape of Miami. The ship was registered in
the Bahamas and had been working the Norway-Denmark line for one
week.
   Oslo's assistant police chief, Magnar Aukrust, said Tuesday, ``I
believe we will be able to discover whoever was behind the fire. We
have some detailed information.''
   Aukrust said about a third of the rescued passengers and crew
have been questioned so far.
   His deputy, Arne Huuse, said, ``We have no specific ... suspect.
But suspicions of arson were strengthened by the technical
investigation on board.''
   Oslo police will publish a list of 186 people considered missing
of the estimated 534 people who boarded the ship. Figures changed
as people considered missing reported in, said Oystein Berger, a
senior police officer.
   Police opened the final cabins for inspection Tuesday, three
days after the smoldering ship was towed into port. Officers said
the devastation will make it hard to identify the victims, or even
count them accurately.
   More than 120 bodies were recovered.
   ``The bodies left on board are so badly burned you can put them
in a teacup,'' said Police Inspector Leif Skoglund. ``I went on the
ship this afternoon. It was terrible.''
   About 20 bodies lay in corridors, people who succumbed to the
smoke as they tried to flee.
   ``A lot of people hid in the shower or the toilet,'' Skoglund
said. ``In one toilet a policeman who tried to count the bodies
couldn't tell if there was one or four.''
   Skoglund said the temperature in midships cabins reached 572
degrees. ``It destroyed everything.''
   Members of the royal family, Prime Minister Jan P. Syse and U.S.
Ambassador Loret Miller Ruppe led about 1,000 people who attended a
state memorial service in Oslo's main cathedral.
   Witnesses said one fire began some time after 2 a.m. Saturday,
but that the fire alarm sounded only at 2:30 a.m. Investigators
said at least two fires were started independently, supporting the
theory that an arsonist was to blame.
   Marine experts from Norway, Sweden and Denmark gathered in
Copenhagen to discuss tightening safety regulations, especially on
board foreign-registered vessels.
   Danish Industry Minister Anne Lundholt said the commission also
would consider requiring full passenger lists for the ferries and
ways to improve emergency training.
   A separate maritime inquiry was due to start in the Danish
capital on Wednesday.
   News reports in Denmark said the Scandinavian Star received a
clean bill of health from an inspection in January by Lloyd's
Register in Miami, where it was then owned by SeaEscape.
   In 1988, a crew member discovered an engine-room fire aboard the
Scandinavian Star as it was returning from Cozumel, Mexico, to its
Tampa home port with 439 passengers, mostly Americans.
   Smoke detectors apparently failed, as did an automatic system to
douse flames. The emergency generators didn't work for an hour,
leaving the vessel without power in rough seas in the Yucatan
Channel, according to NTSB reports released as the agency's
three-day hearing opened in Miami in June 1988.
   ``Although there were no injuries or deaths, the failure of the
vessel's safety systems highlights the potential for a catastrophic
loss of life in this accident and future vessel fires,'' Jim
Burnett, chairman of the NTSB, said then.

   The United States on Tuesday protested
the death an American who died in surgery from a leg wound he
suffered after being shot by Liberian troops.
   The U.S. Embassy said Martin Joseph Millay of Kentucky was on
the campus of a Roman Catholic school last Friday when troops fired
at Millay's car at a roadblock. The embassy's statement disputed
Liberia's claim that the shooting occurred outside the residence of
President Samuel Doe.
   A Liberian spokeswoman said the government deeply regretted the
incident, addign that the soldiers involved have been arrested and
face a court martial.
   Relations between the United States and the West African nation
have been strained since a fire last month destroyed several
million dollars worth of goods at two U.S. Embassy warehouses.
American aid to Liberia has been sharply reduced.
   Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves. It is the
biggest recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa and is the only
West African nation that routinely allows U.S. military planes to
refuel on its territory.

   Two prisoners surrendered at
Strangeways Prison on Tuesday, leaving no more than 20 inmates
continuing a standoff that began April 1 as a riot over crowded
living conditions, authorities said.
   Several inmates who surrendered earlier claimed they had seen
dead bodies in the badly-damaged cell blocks, but one of those who
surrendered Tuesday insisted there had been no deaths.
   ``He is absolutely certain that there are no dead bodies at all
in Strangeways,'' said attorney Charles Peter, who did not identify
his 24-year-old client.
   Earlier, two prison officers were injured by objects thrown by
inmates. One was admitted to a hospital with bruises and a
suspected cracked rib, the Home Office said.
   Hundreds of prisoners rioted over a week ago in the overcrowded
prison, which was heavily damaged when inmates set fires and hurled
roof tiles at guards and firefighters.
   The government on Sunday said it was too dangerous to forcibly
end the siege because of the condition of the largely demolished
prison buildings. Government officials said Strangeways disturbance
sparked unrest at eight other prisons in England and Wales on
Sunday, ranging from a sitdown protest at Leeds Jail to rioting at
Dartmoor prison.

<HEAD>Leading Soviet Communists Hint at Expulsion of Radicals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee accused a radical faction on Tuesday of trying to split
the party and indicated its members could be expelled.
   It said in its statement that the Democratic Platform _ a group
that includes populist Boris N. Yeltsin, historian Yuri Afanasiev
and economist Gavriil Popov _ was trying to turn the party into a
``formless association with full freedom for factions and groups.
That is, to actually break it apart.''
   The Democratic Platform seeks faster and deeper political and
economic reforms than President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The time has come ... when it is necessary to work out what to
do with those party members who are persistently and purposefully
leading affairs to a break,'' the statement said. ``Can these kinds
of people really remain in the ranks of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union?''
   A party congress begins July 2. The party is trying to prevent
more splits after party members in the Baltic republics of
Lithuania and Estonia decided to break away and form independent
parties.
   Democratic Platform has been debating since its formation in
January whether to break with the national Communist Party to form
a Social Democratic Party.
   Such a split could be more serious than the break with the
Baltic parties. Some of the most progressive party members from
across the Soviet Union would likely join the breakaway group,
thereby forming a nationwide opposition.
   The statement of the 248-member Central Committee, a body that
includes all major party leaders, said party organizations must
decide whether individual Democratic Platform members should remain
in the party.
   Gorbachev, who is both president and party leader, has pushed
the Communists to accept a multiparty system but at the same time
has tried to prevent a split among its 19 million members. He says
party unity is necessary to carry out his reform plan.
   Tuesday's Central Committee attack came days after the party in
the Byelorussian republic, which is known for its conservatism,
gave local party organizations the power to expel members of the
Democratic Platform.
   In an interview with the national daily Selskaya Zhizn published
last weekend, Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev attacked the
radicals.
   Ligachev, widely thought by reformers to be among the most
conservative members of the party Politburo, said the Democratic
Platform was reviving the social democratic parties that battled
the Bolsheviks for power as the Russian Empire crumbled.

<HEAD>Peres Announces Picks for Cabinet Amid Talk of Defections</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Labor Cabinet members
announced, Peres trying to end talk of defections; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Tuesday he
wants to serve as both prime minister and foreign minister in a
proposed coalition government, but his announcement was clouded by
reports that two key supporters may defect.
   The media reports, if true, jeopardize the Labor-led coalition's
anticipated 61-59 majority in Wednesday's Parliament vote on the
government.
   Peres tried to quell the talk of defections in an impassioned
speech to Labor's 1,500-member Central Committee, which approved
his party nominees for 11 Cabinet posts in the new government.
   ``We have the support of 61 legislators in Parliament, maybe
more,'' Peres told members of his left-of-center party.
   Peres said all 11 Labor ministers who served in the collapsed
coalition with the right-wing Likud bloc would join the new
Cabinet. He added that at least four more Labor members would join
at a later stage.
   The announcement was met by boos from party activists who had
demanded fresh faces in the new government.
   Other parties in the new coalition would be given other
ministries, Peres said.
   Peres, who was finance minister in the outgoing government, said
he would serve as foreign minister in addition to prime minister.
Labor's No. 2 leader, Yitzhak Rabin, would be defense minister.
   Israel radio Tuesday reported growing speculation that two
legislators from the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party would
renege on their party's coalition agreement with Labor and either
abstain or vote against Labor on Wednesday.
   If Agudat Israel legislators Avraham Verdiger and Eliezer
Mizrahi abstain, Peres would still have a narrow majority. If they
vote against Labor, Peres apparently would be unable to form a
government.
   Agudat Israel has five legislators. It signed a coalition
agreement with Labor last month after the deal was approved by the
party's spiritual leaders, the Council of Torah Greats.
   Rabbi Menachem Porush, a legislator with the party, denied the
speculation about the defections, saying Verdiger and Mizrahi are
bound by the decision of their spiritual leaders.
   ``There is no doubt that the decision of the Council of the
Torah Greats was accepted by all our members,'' Porush told Israel
radio late Tuesday.
   The 61 legislators Peres has been counting on include 39 from
Labor, five from Agudat Israel, five from the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement (CRM), three from the socialist Mapam Party, two
from the left-wing Shinui Party, three from the communist Hadash
Party, and three tiny parties with one legislator each.
   The 61st is Avraham Sharir, a former tourism minister who
defected from the right-wing Likud bloc last week and signed a
coalition agreement with Labor.
   Labor so far has failed to bring the Citizen's Rights Movement,
Mapam and Shinui into the government.
   ``We are going to support the government tomorrow, but we are
not going to join it because of the nature of the coalition between
the Labor Party and a defector,'' Citizens Rights Movement
legislator Yossi Sarid said Tuesday, referring to Sharir.
   ``We would join the government at a later stage when and if
other legitimate parties join,'' Sarid told The Associated Press.
   Agudat Israel will receive the portfolios of housing and social
welfare. Sharir will become minister of transportation and tourism
in return for his defection from Likud.
   The outgoing Cabinet had 25 members, including several without
portfolio. It was not clear whether Peres would keep the Cabinet at
the same size.
   Labor brought down the Likud-Labor coalition March 15 after
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Likud refused to accept U.S.
Middle East peace proposals. Those proposals, supported by Peres,
were intended to clear the way for Palestinian-Israeli talks in
Egypt.

   Chad on Tuesday accused the international community
of complacency toward Libya and said Col. Moammar Gadhafi was
violating human rights in his own country while continuing
aggression against Chadian forces.
   Chad's embassy in Paris released a statement from Foreign
Minister Acheikh Ibn Oumar in which he accused Libya of a military
buildup in the Aouzou region along the border of the two African
countries.
   He said members of breakaway Palestinian guerrilla factions were
being used by Libya as mercenaries against Chad. He also claimed
Libya was holding thousands of citizens of Chad, Mali, Nigeria and
Togo in desert concentration camps on the pretext that they were in
Libya illegally.
   The foreign minister contended that Sudan had signed an accord
with Libya to obtain weapons and money in return for allowing Libya
to mobilize dissident Chadian forces on Sudanese territory.
   France sent 146 soldiers to Chad as reinforcements in late March
after a series of attacks on Chadian troops by the Libyan-backed
rebels. However, the situation has calmed down since then, and the
reinforcements reportedly have been recalled.
   France sent large contingents of troops to Chad in 1983 to help
the government of President Hissene Habre combat a major
intervention by Libya in support of Chadian rebels. Habre's troops
triumphed in 1987, forcing Gadhafi's troops from northern Chad.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn said Tuesday he has resigned
from an all-male suburban golf club, a resignation certain to fuel
speculation about his presidential ambitions.
   ``I have dropped out for personal reasons,'' Nunn said in a
statement released by his office in response to questions about his
membership in the Burning Tree Club of Bethesda, Md.
   Nunn, who considered running for the Democratic nomination for
president in 1988, did not elaborate on his reasons for resigning
from the club, whose members include some of the nation's most
powerful political leaders.
   ``My priority is to run for re-election to the U.S. Senate,''
Nunn said. ``As I have said many times, I have no plans or
inclination to run for president. At no time have I ever
established a pre-set time frame for contemplating a decision on a
future presidential campaign.''
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was the
favorite son of Southern and conservative Democrats during the
early part of the 1988 campaign, but he twice refused to jump into
the race, citing family pressures and his Senate duties.
   The Burning Tree Club, which has been an all-male bastion since
its founding in 1922, last year lost a court battle to regain a tax
break the Maryland Legislature had taken away from it in 1986
because of the club's refusal to admit women as members.
   The club had a long-standing agreement with the state to
preserve its open spaces in return for favorable property tax
treatment. But the legislature, responding to pressure from women's
groups, canceled the agreement, forcing the club to choose between
admitting women or losing its tax break.
   The Supreme Court last fall upheld a lower court ruling that the
new law did not violate members' rights, and in January, the club
paid $1.2 million in back taxes resulting from the case.
   Robert Zarnock, a Maryland assistant attorney general, said
Tuesday the private club has not re-applied for the tax break,
which it could do if it changed its admissions policy.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Bill Authorizing $2 Billion Sale of Telephone Co.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bucking heavy union opposition,
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon on Tuesday signed a bill authorizing
the $2 billion sale of Puerto Rico's government-owned telephone
company.
   ``Never before have government officials of the executive and
legislative branches been confronted with so much pressure and so
much opposition as was unleashed against this bill,'' the governor
said during a signing ceremony at La Fortaleza, his official
residence.
   Earlier in the day, both legislative houses easily approved the
measure. The Senate vote was 16-8, with 3 abstentions; the House of
Representatives vote was 34-17, with 1 abstention.
   Led by a coalition of about 60 unions, opponents have fiercely
opposed the sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. since Hernandez
Colon proposed it in his annual State of the Commonwealth message
in February.
   On March 28, thousands of unionized workers staged a one-day
general strike and rally at the Capitol to protest the sale, which
critics say will result in mass layoffs and higher phone bills.
   At Tuesday's signing, Hernandez Colon accused labor leaders of
``only looking out for their own interests.''
   ``To try to stop this sale by threatening buyers is to go
against the interests of the Puerto Rican people,'' he said,
referring to threats of labor unrest among telephone workers
against any private owner.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to set up two $1 billion
trust funds, one for education and the other for improving public
services such as highway maintenance, sewerage, water and power
systems.
   The government expects $85 million to $95 million in interest
per year.
   The U.S. commonwealth bought the telephone company from ITT
Corp. in 1974 for $165 million. It now earns $70 million a year and
employs 8,000 people.
   Hernandez Colon said the sale should be completed by the end of
this year or early 1991.
   Among U.S. communications companies said to be interested in
buying the telephone company are Contel, GTE, United
Telecommunications Inc. and the Baby Bells.

   The hundreds of millions of dollars
in cash, cars, and other property seized from drug dealers is
setting off disputes among police departments and other agencies,
law enforcement experts said Tuesday.
   Police at a Michigan State University conference on community
policing said departments can become so addicted to the huge sums
of money seized from dealers that raising money becomes more
important than fighting drugs.
   ``Decisions start getting made based on `What's this guy got?'
If he's got a (costly) boat am I going to deal with him or put my
resources on this little guy selling marijuana at the high
school?'' said Robert K. Olson, former police chief in Corpus
Christi, Texas.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration expects to seize more
than $1 billion in assets from drug traffickers this year, said
David Westrate, assistant administrator for operations.
   Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hair, who is involved in a court
battle with the city of Detroit over access to records of how it
has spent seized assets, warned that failure of departments to
account for the money could undermine public confidence.
   ``We have public support for forfeiture in dealing with the drug
problem, but when you have a city administration that shrouds these
dollars in secrecy, you erode public support,'' he said.
   Corpus Christi police routinely made big hauls from drug busts,
Olson said.
   Controls over the money were lax initially, with up to $250,000
in cash routinely kept in an old safe. ``They were just going out
and busting bad guys and stuffing money in the safe,'' Olson said.
   The city used the money to start drug education programs in
local schools and buy equipment, as well as finance more undercover
drug buys.
   But Olson said one unidentified city became so dependent on drug
money to pay drug agents' salaries that its chief pulled out of an
interagency drug task force because he wanted to keep 100 percent
of the forfeited assets rather than a 40 percent share.
   Agencies hungry for drug profits can also end up bidding for
tips from informants, Olson said.
   Michael J. Leverenz, assistant police chief in Tucson, Ariz.,
said early use of seizure laws in that community gave police access
to fancy cars they could use for undercover work, but he warned
against letting those who seize the assets decide what should be
done with them.
   ``As much as possible you want to remove people from the
mentality, `If I go out and seize that Corvette, I'm the one that's
going to drive it,''' he said.
   Bitter battles have been waged between police departments and
city managers in some Arizona cities over how seized assets should
be spent, he said.
   In one small city that netted $1.2 million, the police chief
threatened to let the money go to the federal government if city
officials refused to let him spend it the way he planned, Leverenz
said.
   Michigan law requires seized assets to be used for enforcing
drug laws and they may not replace existing funds, O'Hair said.

<TEXT>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)_ The second trial of Raymond Buckey in the
McMartin Pre-School molestation case opened Tuesday, nearly seven
years after his arrest triggered public hysteria and the nation's
longest criminal trial.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg told 287 prospective
jurors that the retrial could stretch into 1991, and all but 90
said it would be a hardship to serve so long.
   The judge convened court in the jury assembly room because of
the large number of prospects. More jury candidates will be
summoned if the first group of 287 fails to survive questioning on
hardship, publicity and personal views on the widely publicized
case.
   Buckey, 31, has been a defendant for nearly seven years. He was
acquitted of 40 molestation charges Jan. 18; his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges. But prosecutors
decided to retry Buckey on eight counts unresolved by the jury.
Jurors deadlocked on 13 charges, but the prosecution dropped five.
   The first trial of Buckey and his mother lasted nearly three
years and cost $13 million, making it the longest, costliest
criminal trial in U.S. history.
   The eight remaining charges involve three children, a
dramatically diminished number compared to the hundreds once
described as alleged victims at the McMartin Pre-School in
Manhattan Beach.
   Jury selection began a day late due to delays caused by back
trouble plaguing Buckey's longtime attorney, Danny Davis, who said
he could proceed for four hours a day if another attorney could
relieve him.
   Attorney John Wagner, who represented Buckey's sister in a
successful fight to win back her teaching credentials, was named
co-counsel.
   Peggy Ann Buckey was one of seven original defendants in the
case. Charges against her and four others were dismissed before the
first trial.
   Wagner, primarily a civil attorney, said one of his key
qualifications is an adamant conviction that Buckey is innocent.
   ``This stuff never happened,'' he told reporters. ``This is the
witch hunt of 1990.''
   Buckey told reporters he is pleased with his new lawyer but was
not looking forward to ``rehashing the McMartin case again.'' He
said he was confident of acquittal because ``I know what they don't
have.''
   Davis said he considers the retrial ``a farce'' and ``absurd.''
   ``This is nothing but a primary election ploy,'' he said,
referring to District Attorney Ira Reiner's campaign for state
attorney general.
   Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez, who recently took over
the prosecution, disagreed.
   ``We are convinced that Mr. Buckey is a child abuser and until
it's resolved we will continue to prosecute Mr. Buckey,'' he said.

<HEAD>Political Leaders Squabble Over East German Cabinet Seats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East German political leaders squabbled over
the Cabinet seats still open on Tuesday as Prime Minister-designate
Lothar de Maiziere struggled to form a broad-based coalition
government.
   Christian Democrat De Maiziere, who intends to lead the
fledgling democracy to unity with West Germany, said he still
sought a consensus on several issues.
   He added, however, that negotiators made ``a good bit of
headway'' in the drawn-out bargaining and that he was determined to
present the Cabinet list to Parliament for approval Thursday.
   Hans-Wilhem Ebeling of the German Social Union, tapped as
minister for economic cooperation, said negotiators had a night or
two of work ahead before the list was complete.
   The Christian Democrats' Gerhard Pohl appeared the likely choice
for the Economics Ministry, which will oversee melding a
centralized system of state-owned companies with West Germany's
free market.
   He will also be a key player in negotiations with West Germany
over replacing East Germany's nearly worthless currency with the
powerful deutsche mark.
   Apparent differences emerged Tuesday between Pohl and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, an important ally among the West
German Christian Democrats.
   Weeks ago, Kohl suggested East German savers be given a 1-to-1
exchange rate for up to 2,000 East German marks.
   But Pohl told the Cologne Express newspaper a 1-to-1 swap should
be allowed for up to 30,000 marks a person.
   ``An exchange amount of 2,000 marks is no good, it's much to
small,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   A West German mark is worth just under 60 cents.
   Pohl also told the newspaper that ``at least 30 percent of
state-owned operations'' in East Germany are in danger of
extinction.
   The 52-year-old conservative politician was a member of the
previous Communist-dominated Parliament and is his party's leading
economics expert.
   Under an agreement reached Monday, 14 of the 24 Cabinet seats
will go to the winning three-party conservative alliance led by de
Maiziere, seven to the left-leaning Social Democrats and three to a
smaller liberal alliance.
   De Maiziere announced the names of 11 designated ministers and
was expected to announce the rest Tuesday evening before
differences among the prospective coalition partners made more
talks necessary.
   The freely elected government will replace the Communist
caretaker administration that has been running East Germany since
last October's pro-democracy revolt.
   Differences remain between the Christian Democrats and the
Social Democrats over the sticky problem of privatizing East
Germany's state-run companies.
   The Social Democrats want employees to be allowed to take part
in ownership. Christian Democrats favor straight privatization of
the companies.
   Social Democrat leader Markus Meckel said during a breather in
the talks that the atmosphere was ``tense.''
   The parties did agree the property of East German citizens
should be protected for 10 years, and that East Germans should have
preferences in buying land, shares in companies and housing after
the two German states are unified.
   East Germans own no land, and some West Germans have made claims
on property their ancestors owned before Germany was divided after
World War II.
   Although de Maiziere's alliance won the most seats in the
400-member Parliament, it wants a coalition with the Social
Democrats to ensure the two-thirds majority needed to enact
constitutional changes to allow quick unification with West Germany.

   Chile's pro-Moscow Communist Party split
Tuesday when a group of leading members resigned over demands for
more democracy within the body.
   The breakaway group is led by former Sen. Alejandro Toro and
Patricio Hales, who was one of the party's few spokesmen during the
16 years it remained outlawed under the military regime of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet yielded power to elected civilian
President Patricio Aylwin on March 11.
   The leaders of the party dissidents say they have a following of
about 2,000 members of the party, which was legalized last week.
The party, founded 60 years ago, had never before split.
   In a statement announcing their resignations, the dissidents
said they urged the party leadership to change policies for years,
but they were not heard ``because there has not been an internal
democracy.''
   They also criticized the party's support of armed struggle
against the Pinochet regime, saying the stand ``endangered efforts
to restore democracy in Chile.''
   The resigning party members are also known to enthusiastically
support the recent changes in Eastern Europe.
   The party leadership did not immediately comment on the
resignations.
   The Chilean Communist Party was considered the second largest in
the southern hemisphere, after Cuba's, before the 1973 military
coup led by Pinochet. At that time, it had around 16 percent of the
national vote.
   In December's general election, it failed to elect a single
congressman.

<HEAD>2 USAir Pilots, FAA Reach Agreement</HEAD>

   The captain and co-pilot of a USAir jetliner
that crashed at LaGuardia Airport last year can fly again if they
pass recertification tests, the pilots and the Federal Aviation
Administration have agreed.
   The FAA had revoked the captain's license of Capt. Michael
Martin and suspended the license of co-pilot Constantine Kleissas,
who was at the controls before their Boeing 737 slid off a runway
Sept. 20, killing two.
   Both agreed to drop their appeals of the FAA's action, meaning
they can apply for recertification sooner than they could have
otherwise, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Tuesday. Both could
have applied in any case.
   In revoking Martin's captain's license in March, the FAA said he
``does not possess the care, skill, judgment and responsibility''
of a commercial pilot. It charged that he failed to check a rudder
control or monitor engine thrust, and waited too late before
aborting takeoff.
   Martin dropped his appeal without admitting wrongdoing. The FAA
agreed to backdate the revocation to Sept. 21, meaning he can apply
for a new captain's license in September rather than waiting until
March.
   The FAA also agreed not to revoke Martin's co-pilot's license,
which it had suspended. Martin can apply for recertification for
that license at any time, as can Kleissas, Ms. Bergen said.
   The test includes oral and flight simulator exams.
   Martin and Kleissas have been suspended with pay from USAir
since the accident. The airline will retrain them and return them
to flight duty if they pass airline and FAA requirements, said
USAir spokesman John Bronson.

   A fire raced through a townhouse Tuesday,
claiming the lives of a young couple, their son and two daughters,
authorities said. A neighbor said the father screamed in vain for
help.
   The only member of the Buchanan family left alive was 6-year-old
Staci, who had already left for school when the blaze broke out at
the central Delaware home around 8 a.m, said state Fire Marshal J.
Benjamin Roy.
   ``We think it began in the living room near the steps'' and
quickly swept up the steps, trapping the family, Roy said.
   Four bodies were found in second-floor bedrooms. A 1-year-old
baby was found in the living room.
   Next-door neighbor Judy Koria said she heard the father,
27-year-old Eddie Buchanan Sr., calling for aid.
   ``He was screaming out back for help, but there was nothing I
could do,'' she said.
   The other victims were tentatively identified as Buchanan's
wife, Susan, 23; daughter Crystal, 1; daughter Amber, 4, and son
Eddie Jr., 3.
   ``I still have to explain to my son that the little boy he's
been playing with for two weeks is not coming back,'' said Koria.
``How do you explain to a little girl that she has nothing to come
home to?''
   Staci, who moved to the area with her family about a month ago,
was placed in her grandmother's care.
   Roy said there was no evidence to indicate arson, but that the
cause of the blaze was still under investigation.

<TEXT>
   One day after issuing a harsh new warning to
Lithuanian separatists, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
backed off the tough line Tuesday by declaring he does not yet see
a need to impose presidential rule.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, responding to the
severe tone of Monday's declaration by the Kremlin, sent a telegram
to Gorbachev saying he feared that ``ultra-rightist imperial forces
are compelling you to take a wrong step: to continue the wrongs of
the 1940s in the Baltics.''
   ``In the name of peace, justice and concord on earth, do not do
this,'' he wrote.
   He was referring to the Soviet occupation and forced annexation
of the three Baltic republics _ Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia _ in
1940.
   Since March 11, when Lithuania declared its independence
restored, the Kremlin has repeatedly alternated between threatening
and conciliatory tones. On several occasions, threatening military
movements were followed by kinder words.
   Speaking Tuesday at a Young Communist League congress in Moscow,
Gorbachev said presidential rule would be used only as an extreme
measure during a civil conflict, the Tass news agency said. He said
Soviet leaders are still trying to persuade Lithuanians to rescind
their declaration of independence.
   Presidential rule could include martial law and dissolving
Lithuania's parliament. It was elected in March and is Lithuania's
first freely elected parliament in 50 years.
   However, in a meeting Tuesday with British Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd, Gorbachev said, ``The adventurist actions of the
current leadership can cost the Lithuanian people themselves, the
Soviet Union and world peace dearly.
   ``We display the maximum political goodwill, although it is
increasingly harder to do,'' Tass quoted the Soviet leader as
saying.
   In the latest Soviet show of strength, several tanks rolled
through Gediminas Square in the center of Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital, overnight Monday, according to Eduardas Potasinskas of
Lithuanian television.
   At his own news conference Tuesday, Gorbachev spokesman Arkady
Maslennikov said the Soviet Union plans no economic blockade among
the unspecified ``economic and political measures'' threatened
Monday by Gorbachev's presidential council.
   But Maslennikov implied the Soviet Union might start demanding
world market prices from Lithuania for the subsidized oil, gas and
other raw materials that the small Baltic state needs. He said this
would cost Lithuania $6 billion.
   He said some Soviet enterprises have talked of refusing to
extend existing contracts with Lithuania, and he warned that items
in short supply might be sent elsewhere.
   ``We are not saying, `Please, stop thinking about
independence,''' Maslennikov said after several tougher statements.
``But don't do it overnight. Don't tear well-established economic,
political and other links, including defense.''
   He suggested Lithuanian leaders consider a moratorium on all
decisions since they declared independence. He also suggested that
Lithuania ``not insist on state-to-state negotiations'' with the
Soviet Union.
   Lithuania has offered to discuss Gorbachev's claim that its
action violates the Soviet Constitution. But Gorbachev has demanded
Lithuania rescind its declaration of independence before discussing
anything.
   Also Tuesday, the Lithuanian-appointed public prosecutor,
Arturas Paulauskas, was barred from entering his office, which he
has shared for the past week with a competing prosecutor appointed
by Moscow. Soviet troops occupied the building March 30 but until
Tuesday had allowed Paulauskas to enter.
   Paulauskas' secretary, Henrika Pocei, said by telephone that
Paulauskas would work elsewhere in the city. Virtually the entire
staff in the main building is continuing to report to him and
ignoring the new prosecutor from Moscow, she said.
   Maslennikov said the Soviet Union is not worried that its
actions in Lithuania might upset plans for a U.S.-Soviet summit at
the end of May.
   In Washington, President Bush was to meet Wednesday with
American Baltic organizations supporting the independence drives of
Lithuania as well as Latvia and Estonia. The White House schedule
listed the meeting for 10 a.m. EDT.
   ``In our view, a meeting between Baltic groups and the president
will send a clear signal to Moscow, regardless of what we discuss,
that the U.S. is ready to step up pressure in support of Baltic
independence,'' said Olars Kalnins, head of the American Latvian
Association. Kalnins, in London for a meeting of the World
Federation of Free Latvians, was to cut short his European visit
and fly to Washington for the meeting.
   The United States has expressed support for Lithuania's
independence drive, but it has been reluctant to say or do anything
that might undermine Gorbachev and his reform program.
   Bush, in Toronto for a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, issued a fresh warning to Gorbachev on Tuesday to
avoid using force in Lithuania.
   But he coupled his words with praise for the Soviet president's
commitment to ``peaceful change and the evolution of democracy'' in
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``I would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence
to encourage dialogue and discussion,'' he said.

<HEAD>Canadian House Passes 7 Percent Consumption Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons ended nine months of
rancorous debate on Tuesday and passed a 7 percent goods and
services tax presented by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Conservative government. The vote was 144 to 114.
   The consumption tax proposal now heads for debate in the
Liberal-dominated Senate.
   If passed by both chambers, the tax would take effect next Jan.
1, replacing the existing 13.5 percent federal sales tax hidden in
the price of manufactured products.
   Under the Constitution, the tax legislation must be passed by
both the Commons and Senate and approved by the governor general
before it becomes law.
   Cheers and jeers echoed through the Commons as the vote was
concluded and two protesters were hauled out of a visitors' gallery
for throwing rolls of paper over a balcony onto the chamber floor.
   On Monday, the Pro-Canada Network, an umbrella organization of
unions, churches and social lobby groups, said it counted more than
2 million votes from across Canada against the measure and in favor
of tax reform based on ability to pay.
   Recent polls indicate that up to 80 percent of Canadians oppose
the tax.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson, architect of the tax, and
Mulroney were not in the Commons.
   Wilson was in Europe on government business and Mulroney was in
Toronto to watch a Blue Jays baseball game with President Bush.

   A judge ruled Tuesday that a cult leader and
two followers could be extradited to Ohio, where they have been
charged with 10 others in the slaying of a five-member family.
   Municipal Judge Terry J. Knoepp issued the extradition order
following a 15-minute hearing for cult leader Jeffrey Lundgren,
Kathryn Johnson and Daniel Kraft.
   Each had fought extradition since their arrests three months
ago. The three are among 13 alleged cult members indicted in the
slayings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three daughters.
Authorities believe the killings took place last April 17 at the
group's farm in Kirtland, Ohio.
   Lundgren, 39, a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints, is charged with 10 counts of
aggravated murder and kidnapping. He could face the death penalty
if convicted.
   Kraft, 25, faces five counts of aggravated murder, while
Johnson, 36, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
   Prosecutors in Ohio have alleged that the Averys, who also
belonged to Lundgren's cult, were killed as part of a ``cleansing''
sacrifice before group members left the Kirtland farm on wilderness
treks in other states.
   Their capture ended a nationwide manhunt. On Jan. 3-4 the bodies
of the Avery family were found buried under a barn on the rented
farm where the group lived commune-style in Kirtland, about 30
miles east of Cleveland.
   Authorities in Lake County, Ohio, have until April 20 to pick up
the defendants and return them.
   Defense attorneys had filed legal challenges to the extradition,
but they were denied by a state appeals court last week.
   Lundgren's attorney, Militza Durovic, sought a review by the
state Supreme Court, but told the judge that she had received no
response.
   Lundgren's return could be postponed if the high court issues a
stay of extradition before he leaves San Diego, but Durovic
acknowledged outside court that such a ruling was ``a long shot.''
Attorneys for Johnson and Kraft did not seek a Supreme Court review.
   Lundgren, his wife, Alice, 38; and 19-year-old son, Damon, were
arrested Jan. 7 in a San Diego-area motel room near the Mexican
border. Kraft, of Nauvoo, Ill., and Johnson, of Holden, Mo., were
arrested Jan. 10.
   Damon Lundgren was returned to Ohio last week after legal
challenges to his extradition failed. He has pleaded innocent to
five counts each of aggravated murder and kidnapping.
   Alice Lundgren waived extradition shortly after her arrest and
was returned voluntarily to Ohio in late January. She has pleaded
innocent to five counts each of complicity, conspiracy and
kidnapping.
   Jeffrey Lundgren also had been a tour guide at the Kirtland
temple of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints until he was ousted for radical teachings and formed his
sect.
   The church is separate from the Salt Lake City-based Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, known as the Mormons, although
they have common roots and share some beliefs.

   The Board of Supervisors declared the
county's measles epidemic a public health hazard Tuesday, clearing
the way for it to apply for $300,000 in state funds to boost local
immunization efforts.
   Officials say 1,500 county residents, mostly children, have been
afflicted with measles so far this year; six have died.
   ``We are having the worst measles epidemic,'' said Supervisor
Kenneth Hahn, who asked that all county health centers be kept open
evenings and Saturdays to get more people vaccinated.
   County officials said several clinics in areas where the measles
epidemic is the worst are already staying open nights and weekends
to provide free measles vaccinations. That service is expected to
cost the county $370,000.
   Robert Gates, the county's health services chief, said he would
look into Hahn's request to keep all clinics open.
   A measles outbreak has been plaguing much of the state since
1987, but worsened during the first few weeks of this year.
   ``It's out of control,'' Dr. Loring Dales, head of the
immunization unit of the state Department of Health Services, said
earlier in the year.
   Other afflicted areas include San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange,
San Diego and Alameda counties and the San Joaquin Valley.
   Nationwide, 16,000 cases of measles were reported last year; 45
resulted in deaths.
   Health officials have blamed the epidemic in part on a large
influx of poor people from foreign countries, many of whom are not
immunized and who don't know about the free health services
available in the United States.

   A federal jury Tuesday convicted a Mohawk
Indian of leading armed resistance to a gambling raid at two
reservation casinos last summer, but found him innocent of a more
serious felony charge.
   The U.S. District Court jury acquitted Kakwirakeron, 47, of
using a deadly or dangerous weapon to turn back FBI agents, and did
not consider another felony charge of using a firearm in commission
of a crime.
   Kakwirakeron, also known as Arthur Montour, was convicted of
conspiracy and forcibly impeding the execution of federal search
warrants during the July 20 raid at the St. Regis Reservation.
   Kakwirakeron faces up to three years in prison and a $5,000
fine. Sentencing was set for June 12.
   The verdict came during the first full day of deliberations
after jurors listened to nearly four hours of testimony by the
defendant and four state police investigators.
   In closing arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Duncan
charged that Kakwirakeron should not be excused because of the
Mohawks' beliefs the 28,000-acre reservation on the U.S.-Canadian
border is sovereign, and therefore exempt from state and federal
law.
   Duncan also disputed the contention that the Mohawks mistook the
casino raid as an assault on their land. He said Mohawk sovereignty
was not at issue and charged that Kakwirakeron wanted to force a
conflict.
   The confrontation led to a 12-day standoff.
   Defense Attorney Seth Shapiro had argued the government
presented ``not one credible shred of evidence'' to prove his
client ordered barricades be erected outside Tony's Vegas
International and The Bear's Den casinos during the raid.
   Kakwirakeron has said he was just one of many spokesmen for the
Warrior Society, a self-appointed security force.
   Although other casinos were searched and 13 people arrested, a
group of armed Mohawks blocked a highway and refused to let
authorities search the two casinos.
   Two undercover investigators testified that casino workers were
removing slot machines from the gambling parlors in the hours
before the pre-dawn raid.
   Kakwirakeron testified during the six-day trial that he spent
the entire day of the raid on a portable telephone trying to
negotiate a peaceful settlement to the standoff.
   Witnesses for both sides testified Kakwirakeron had helped
negotiate settlements in past conflicts with the Mohawks in 1974,
1977 and 1979.

   Partial election results on Tuesday
showed a center-right coalition with a large majority in Slovenia's
first multiparty parliament, but the Communists will remain the
largest single party.
   With about 43 percent of the ballots counted from Sunday's
elections, the first in the Yugsolav republic in 45 years, the
DEMOS coalition of six center-right and conservative parties had
76.3 percent.
   The Communists, whose monopoly on power in the republic was
abolished, received 17.3 percent.
   Final results are expected Thursday.
   The Slovenian Liberal Party, campaigning outside DEMOS, trailed
the Communists as the second-largest single party with 15.6 percent.
   The Slovenian Christian Democrats received the most votes in the
DEMOS coalition with 13.3 percent.
   Slovenian Communists have moved quickly the past three years to
create a pluralistic political system in their republic. Their
reforms have been initiated despite harsh criticism from Serbia,
the largest Yugoslav republic, where Communist leaders demand
continued Communist dominance.
   Presidential candidates Milan Kucan, of the Slovenian Communist
Party that changed its name to the Party of Democratic Renewal, and
Joze Pucnik of DEMOS coalition will face each other in a runoff
April 22. In Sunday's primary Kucan took 44.5 percent and Pucnik
26.6 percent.
   Elsewhere, a U.S. congressional delegation on Tuesday toured the
southern province of Kosovo, where a crackdown against Albanian
dissent appeared to be gaining momentum.
   The mission headed by Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., was
scheduled to meet with members of ethnic Albanian opposition groups
and with officials of the local administration in the regional
capital of Pristina, 140 miles south of Belgrade, a U.S. Embassy
spokeswoman said.
   DeConcini was accompanied by Reps. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., Helen
Delich-Bentley, R-Md., and Jim Moody, D-Wis., on a factfinding
mission to the province that has been the scene of continuing
unrest.
   The delegation was also scheduled to meet with representatives
of the Serbian minority in Kosovo, who claim they are being
harassed by the Albanians, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   Kosovo is an administrative part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic of Serbia, whose hard-line Communist leadership brought
the region under strong central control last year by changing the
state constitution that had granted self-government to the area.

   President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
together tossed out the first balls Tuesday to begin the Toronto
Blue Jays' opening game against Bush's homestate Texas Rangers.
   The two smiled broadly as they threw the balls to a group of
ballplayers standing under the covered Skydome.
   Boos were mixed with applause as Bush and Mulroney came onto the
field and a huge banner reading ``Axe the Tax'' was plastered
across the bleachers. Mulroney's proposed 7 percent tax on goods
and services, passed Tuesday by the House of Commons, is widely
unpopular.
   Bush and Mulroney wore matching royal blue baseball jackets _
Mulroney's emblazoned with the Blue Jays' logo and Bush's with the
name of the Texas team partly owned by his son, George W. Bush.
   They later shed the jackets for their suit-and-tie outfits as
they sat in an upper-level VIP box overlooking the field. Bush, a
baseball fan and former captain of his Yale University team, ate
snacks as they watched the game.
   Before the game, Bush and Mulroney visited the locker rooms of
each team. In the Rangers' dressing room, Bush said he was cheering
for his son's team.
   ``Got to raise the flag,'' he said. Bush's adoptive home state
is Texas.
   Spotting a woman photographer in the Rangers' locker room, Bush
exclaimed: ``Ladies in the locker room! A new era!''
   The Blue Jays, the defending American League East champions,
drew a near-sellout crowd to the 51,000-seat stadium.
   The stadium officials provided visiting reporters with
``skyfacts'' about the venue Bush's entourage was visiting.
   Among them:
   _Eight miles of zippers hold down the baseball field's bright
green turf.
   _The facility's 1,280 toilets, if flushed simultaneously, would
use the amount of water that flows over Niagra Falls in three
seconds.
   _The amount of toilet paper used in its first year of operation
could reach to the moon.

<TEXT>
   Debt-ridden Detroit, one of five finalists to
host the 1992 Democratic National Convention, withdrew from
consideration Tuesday.
   The city can't afford the convention and Mayor Coleman Young is
too busy working on finances to devote time to it, said Dorothy
Brodie, executive mayoral assistant for federal affairs.
   The Democratic National Committee has asked any city bidding for
the convention to commit to spend $15 million, Brodie said. Detroit
faces a deficit estimated at $50 million to $81 million.
   A site-selection team from the national committee has inspected
three of the finalists _ Cleveland, Houston and New York City _ and
had been scheduled to visit Detroit next week, said committee press
secretary Ginny Terzano.
   ``We still hadn't eliminated any of the finalists. Detroit was
still very much in the process,'' she said, adding that the team
will visit New Orleans at the end of this month.
   Young's staff told her the city was withdrawing its bid early
Tuesday.
   ``We regret that,'' Terzano said. ``It's unfortunate, but we
understand that he (Young) wants to look at his own back yard.''
   But she said the upfront costs of being host of the convention
paid off.
   ``The money you initially put in is returned three to fourfold.
And you have to look at all that free publicity,'' Terzano said.
   Brodie agreed that the costs can pay off.
   ``The national attention directed to a city is good in terms of
booking subsequent conventions,'' she said. ``There's a monetary
spinoff with people spending in the city.''
   But ``there are issues the mayor feels need his attention and
unfortunately this isn't one of them,'' Brodie said. Young is to
present his budget to the City Council on Thursday.
   Young's decision was generally supported.
   ``I think in some ways it's tragic because we could use it,''
City Councilman David Eberhard said. ``But you have to put things
on a priority level.''

   A Mexican man accused of taking part in the
1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was arraigned
Tuesday on federal charges that included conspiracy and kidnapping
and ordered held without bail.
   Humberto Alvarez Machain, 42, was arraigned on charges of
conspiracy to commit violent crimes in aid of racketeering,
conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent, committing violent crimes in
aid of racketeering, kidnapping a federal agent and murdering a
federal agent, said Grace Denton, spokeswoman for the U.S.
Attorney's office.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered Alvarez held without
bail pending trial May 1.
   Alvarez was arrested April 3 in El Paso, Texas, Ms. Denton said.
   He is one of 18 people accused in the kidnapping and murder of
Camarena.
   Prosecutors say Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agent, was tortured and killed by members of the Guadalajara,
Mexico, narcotics cartel, an organization that allegedly
distributes tons of marijuana and cocaine.
   Camarena disappeared in February 1985. His badly beaten body and
that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were found the following
month in a remote area north of Guadalajara.
   Of the 18, four are in U.S. custody awaiting trial, including
Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, allegedly a Honduran drug kingping,
and prominent Mexican businessman Ruben Zuno Arce, the
brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis Echeverria.

   The heart of a U.S. soldier killed in a barroom
fight in Nice has been successfully transplanted into a Frenchman
with coronary disease, a medical spokesman said Tuesday.
   The operation took place March 19 at a clinic in the southern
town of Saint-Laurent-du-Var. It was carried out less than 48 hours
after 29-year-old Pfc. Edward R. Chevers was fatally injured during
a brawl with bar workers.
   The medical spokesman listed the dead soldier as Edward Cheever,
but army spokesman Lt. Col. Arnie Laidig in Washington identified
the enlisted man's name as Chevers.
   Laidig said Chevers was from Sherman, Texas, and was a
communications maintenance specialist with Headquarters and
Headquarters Company, 4th Battalion, 7th Infantry based at
Schaffenburg, West Germany, 37 miles outside Frankfurt.
   Details were not announced until Tuesday because doctors wanted
to be sure the operation was successful.
   Chevers, who had stipulated his body be donated to science, was
in France with three companians on leave.
   The heart recipient, 32-year-old Robert Ruiz, came through the
operation well, according to his father, Emile. He said his son was
able to walk four days after surgery.

   U.S. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said
Tuesday that parents and teachers must lead the way to improve
education for Hispanics, a group that suffers a 40 percent dropout
rate before completing high school.
   At the first of five hearings across the nation on Hispanic
education, Cavazos said he supports ``school-based management'' in
which local educators and parents have more input in education
reform.
   ``President Bush and I believe strongly that parents and
teachers hold the key to successful educational reform,'' Cavazos
said. ``Parental involvement is a responsibility and also a right.''
   Cavazos said the hearing's purpose was not to produce another
study but to seek solutions for Hispanic education.Other hearings
are scheduled in Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami.
   ``With your help we can identify and dismantle barriers to
Hispanic education,'' said Cavazos, the former president of Texas
Tech University. ``We've been talking about this for years and
years, but we've done nothing about it.''
   During the 1980s, about 40 percent of Hispanics nationwide left
school before high school graduation; in Texas the dropout rate was
45 percent, he said.
   Only 11 percent of Hispanics complete four or more years of
college by the time they are in their early 30s, he said.
   Liz Cuevas, a 16-year-old student, testified that economics
contribute to the Hispanic dropout problem.
   ``The students have to support their families, and I don't think
that's right,'' Ms. Cuevas said. ``They say, `I'm getting money
now. I don't know if I'm going to be alive tomorrow.'''
   More flexible school hours would help students who must work,
she said. Ms. Cuevas also suggested improving communication between
young people and their parents and teachers.
   ``What makes me different is that I care. A lot of students
don't care,'' she said. ``I want to make something out of myself. I
want to be a lawyer. I want to help people.''
   Gloria Rodriguez, director of the Avance family support project
in San Antonio, testified that one reason students drop out is that
their parents don't expect them to finish high school.
   ``Parenting is not something that comes naturally. It is a skill
that you learn,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, whose program helps parents
learn about child care while furthering their education and job
training.
   Louis J. Agnese Jr., president of Incarnate Word College in San
Antonio, said lack of money, lack of preparation and perceptions of
failure cause Hispanics to leave school.
   Agnese proposed a national marketing campaign showing
achievement through Hispanic role models. He also said politicians
must find equitable funding for all school districts.

   A runaway power plant on the space
shuttle Discovery forced NASA to scrub its launch Tuesday with the
Hubble Space Telescope, and officials said it will be a week or two
before they try again.
   The countdown was down to the four-minutes-to-go mark when
sensors detected that one of three auxiliary power units was
running too fast. Computers halted the launch process.
   ``A valve which failed to respond let too much fuel go into the
unit which caused an overspeed condition,'' said Bob Sieck, the
Kennedy Space Center's launch director.
   The APUs pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic system, which is
used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking and
steering systems.
   Astronomers who had gathered for the big event were
philosophical about the latest delay in getting the $1.5 billion
telescope into orbit.
   ``The universe has been around for a long time, it will stay
around for a couple more days,'' said John Holtzman, of the Lowell
Observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz.
   The countdown had gone without a hitch until shuttle commander
Loren Shriver flipped a switch to start the three APUs, and one ran
erratically.
   NASA rules forbid a liftoff unless all three units operate
perfectly.
   ``We call it quits here,'' Sieck told the astronauts and his
flight controllers.
   The huge external fuel tank was drained of its half-million
gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Each scrub costs
$377,000 in lost fuel and each day's delay means $247,000 in labor
and materials, not including the other NASA centers supporting the
mission.
   The power unit will have to be removed from Discovery while the
shuttle is in upright launch position. In addition, technicians
will either have to remove the telescope's batteries and recharge
them elsewhere, or run equipment out to the pad to charge them
aboard the ship.
   The batteries will hold their charge through Friday, but after
that would have to undergo an eight-day recharge on the ground. In
orbit, the Hubble's solar panels supply electricity to the
batteries.
   Sieck said the auxiliary power unit weighs 100 pounds and will
be difficult to remove. He said NASA officials will have a better
idea in the next few days when they can reschedule the launch.
   Replacing the entire APU would mean a delay of at least several
days, said Keith L. Hudkins, chief of NASA's shuttle orbiter
division. Replacing a part, however, could be done in a day or so.
   Shriver and his crew of four had lain on their backs in the
shuttle cabin for three hours when the launch attempt was called
off.
   NASA said the crew would return to their training base, the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, on Wednesday.
   Most astronomers who had come to see the launch took the delay
well.
   Giovanni Fazio of the Smithsonian Astrophysics Observatory said
``we waited this long, and it's better not to rush this thing.
Whatever they do, that's a $1.5 billion payload and there's no use
taking any chances with it.''
   Others were disappointed.
   ``We've been waiting seven years for this thing to go up, so
it's very depressing in a sense,'' said Francesco Paresce of the
European Space Agency, a scientist who will work with observations
from the telescope's faint object camera.
   ``I was hoping that today would be the beginning of a new
life,'' he said. ``In four minutes my life was going to be
completely different with the thing up there, with operations, with
the instrument pouring data out by the billions of bits.''
   About 150 relatives of Edwin P. Hubble, the astronomer for whom
the telescope is named, headed for a pool party after the scrub.
   ``These things have happened. It's part of the game,'' said
Harvey Hubbell IV, a 60-year-old retired businessman who organized
the family gathering. ``We would much rather you stop the count
than do something foolish.''
   Two other shuttle launches have been delayed because of
auxiliary power unit problems. One, in 1981, caused an eight-day
delay; another, in 1984, a five-day wait.

<HEAD>Alaskans Say Soviets Leaving Polluted Mess Behind at Czech Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military is leaving behind
polluted land, streams and underground water supplies as it
abandons long-occupied bases in Czechoslovakia, an Alaska
environmental services company said Tuesday.
   ``It's just a mess,'' said former Alaska Gov. Bill Sheffield, a
director of Martech USA, an Anchorage-based company that has
negotiated a tentative agreement with the Czech government to help
it clean up bases and other sites.
   The Soviets ``just kind of covered up their tracks. In some
places they just left it all exposed and running into the river,''
Sheffield said.
   Underground fuel tanks have been ripped up and the craters
covered over with dirt and gravel, he said.
   Martech also said pipelines or storage tanks are leaching
unidentified substances onto the ground or into streams.
   Sheffield and other company officials last week toured several
areas including the Frenstat military base with Prime Minister
Peter Pithart and other Czech officials.
   The officials were shown one off-limits site at Frenstat where
they were told a Soviet germ warfare stockpile was still being
stored, Sheffield said.
   Martech and the Czech government signed a letter of intent
Friday to form a joint venture to clean up the sites, Martech
President Bill Tisdale said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Company officials visited ``highly polluted'' sites at Frenstat
where Soviet forces apparently had been dumping materials onto the
ground for decades, Tisdale said. Observers found fuel and other
unidentified pollutants in rivers and drinking water supplies, he
said.
   Frenstat was the first base to be evacuated by Soviet soldiers,
Tisdale said. Soldiers began leaving the base in northern
Czechoslovakia on Feb. 26.
   Martech plans on April 25 to begin analyzing substances to be
cleaned up.
   Tisdale would not say how much money the work involved.
   Two other bases, at Bruntal and Krnov, already have been turned
over to the Czechs and both will require ``extensive'' cleanup
work, the company said.
   Martech said it will act as managing partner in a joint venture
with Geo Test, a state-run hydrology and engineering company.
   Martech will open an office in Prague and will provide
professional expertise and equipment. Geo Test will provide some
skilled and all unskilled workers, Tisdale said.
   No details have been worked out on how the Alaskan company will
be paid for its work, Sheffield said.

<HEAD>Soviet Suggests Germany Belong to Both NATO and Warsaw Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union could accept a unified Germany
that belonged to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact during a transition
to a new European security system, a top Soviet adviser has told
The New York Times.
   Soviet and American troops stationed in Germany should be
reduced gradually during such a transition period, which would last
for five to seven years, said Valentin M. Falin, chief of the
international department of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee.
   The Times said in Wednesday editions that it was not clear
exactly how the transitional period or the new security system
would work.
   ``We need to arrive at an all-European security system in a few
years, through some transitional steps,'' Falin told the newspaper
in an interview Monday night in Moscow.
   ``The idea that for a certain time a unified Germany could
remain with its Western part in NATO and its Eastern part in the
Warsaw Pact, as a modus vivendi for a few years, would probably be
acceptable to our side,'' Falin said.
   He added that ``the most important thing would be that Germany
then becomes a motor to help to extract the best out of these two
organizations and then meld them into an all-European security
structure.''
   Falin repeated the Soviet Union's position that it could not
accept a united Germany belonging only to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. The Soviet Union dropped its previous insistence on a
neutral Germany during last week's visit by Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze to Washington.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the Times
report while traveling with President Bush in Toronto, said he knew
nothing about it.
   Shevardnadze suggested during his Washington visit that a merged
Germany could be part of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, but gave no
specifics. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said then that the
idea was not ``attractive,'' and that the United States remained
firm in its position that a unified Germany must remain in NATO.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday that the
reunification of Germany should be synchronized with the formation
of a new security structure for all of Europe, the Tass news agency
reported from Moscow. Gorbachev told visiting British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd that a transitional stage is possible in the
meantime, Tass reported.

<TEXT>
   For Ann Richards, who captured the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination Tuesday, a sense of humor is a
necessary ingredient in the political mix. Just ask her about the
dog.
   Ms. Richards, who won celebrity status with a witty keynote
speech to the Democratic National Convention in 1988, first won
public office in 1976 when she was elected a Travis County
commissioner.
   It was ``a truck-driving, front-end-loader'' kind of job, she
recalls. So when she first met her county road crew, she tried to
break the ice by asking the men about the one thing she felt
certain they would discuss with a woman _ their dog.
   ``No one said a word. There was some shuffling of feet,'' she
recalled in her 1989 autobiography, ``Straight from the Heart.''
   Trying to make them comfortable, the new boss told the men she
was accustomed to rough language and asked the dog's name.
   ``An old hand in the back row with a big wide belt and a big
wide belt buckle sat up and said in a gravel bass, `Well, you're
gonna find out sooner or later. ... Her name is Ann Richards.' I
laughed. And when I laughed they roared,'' she said. ``From then
on, those guys and I were good friends.''
   Her humor was one of the main reasons then-Democratic Party boss
Paul Kirk tapped Ms. Richards to keynote the Atlanta convention,
where she immediately charmed the crowd by saying, ``After
listening to George Bush all these years I figured you needed to
know what a real Texas accent sounds like.''
   She sealed her sharp-tongued reputation with this line about
Bush: ``Poor George. He can't help it. He was born with a silver
foot in his mouth.''
   That speech capped an involvement in politics that began in the
late 1950s.
   Ms. Richards, now 56, grew up near Waco, married civil rights
lawyer David Richards, volunteered in campaigns and raised four
children.
   ``I was by no means a full-time political activist. I was
involved in whatever political opportunities I could find, with the
constraints of raising a family,'' she said.
   In the 1960s, she helped form the North Dallas Democratic Women,
``basically to allow us to have something substantive to do; the
regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who
looked on women as little more than machine parts.''
   Ms. Richards served on the Travis County Commission in Austin
for six years before jumping to a bigger arena in 1982, winning the
Texas treasurer's office to become the first woman elected
statewide in 50 years.
   But politics took a toll. It helped break up her marriage. And
public life has forced her to be remarkably candid about her 1980
treatment for alcoholism.
   ``I had seen the very bottom of life,'' she recalled. ``I was so
afraid that I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would
lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery
turned out to be a wonderful thing.''
   Although the primary and runoff campaigns turned into a muddy
brawl that included allegations of drug use against her, Ms.
Richards entered the race hinting that she knew what lay ahead.
   ``You know, Sam Rayburn used to say that any jackass can kick
down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one,'' she said last
summer. ``I'm against negative campaigning. But I'm not a shy
violet who'll take it across the head and not respond.''

   Hundreds of friends and strangers filed past
the open casket holding Ryan White on Tuesday, and singer Elton
John handed out tissues to tearful mourners of the AIDS sufferer.
   White was dressed in a red pullover shirt and a faded jean
jacket, and his eyes were covered with reflective sunglasses. A
photograph of a baby rested next to him in the knotty pine coffin,
around which were numerous floral arrangements.
   There also was a painted portrait, magazine covers that featured
his story and photographs of White with celebrities and others,
including Lukas Haas, who portrayed him in a television movie,
actress Loni Anderson and Indiana University basketball coach Bob
Knight.
   White, who won a court battle to attend public school and later
became an international spokesman for sufferers of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, died Sunday of lung congestion from an
AIDS-related respiratory infection. He had been hospitalized after
contracting the disease in 1984 from blood products used to treat
his hemophilia.
   Between 1,000 and 1,500 people filed past White's casket at the
Flanner &amp; Buchanan Mortuary in Carmel, an Indianapolis suburb,
between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the funeral home closed, said a
mortuary worker who refused to give her name.
   His mother, Jeanne White, spoke with callers at the funeral home
Tuesday. Standing next to her was John, who had befriended White
and comforted the family during the youth's final days in the
hospital. He handed tissues to weeping mourners.
   White's younger sister, Andrea, also was among those in the
viewing room.
   Brian Buchanan, vice president of the funeral home, said Mrs.
White set up the viewing area with John's help.
   Callers were lined up when doors opened, Buchanan said.
   Pop star Michael Jackson was among family and close friends who
paid last respects earlier before the home was opened to the
general public, he said.
   Those who came included included White's physician, Dr. Martin
Kleiman.
   To one woman who identified herself as a former employer of
White, Mrs. White said, ``Thank you so much for giving him a job.''
   Mrs. White also laughed and hugged several people who greeted
her. No cameras or recorders were allowed in the funeral home.
   A public funeral is to be held Wednesday, with Jackson and first
lady Barbara Bush among those expected to attend, hospital
officials said. John will sing ``The Lord is My Shepherd'' and his
own song, ``Skyline Pigeon.''
   Also expected to attend are scores _ perhaps hundreds _ of
White's classmates from Hamilton Heights High School in Arcadia.
   In Noblesville, Ind., about 300 cards, letters, telegraphs and
donations from across the country arrived Tuesday at the Ameritrust
National Bank, which manages a trust fund for the White family.
   More than 3,000 cards have arrived at the bank since White
entered the Riley Hospital for Children on March 29, officials said.

   A lawyer for Exxon said the nation's
worst oil spill was a ``tragic accident'' after the corporation and
a subsidiary pleaded innocent to a five-count federal criminal
indictment.
   Attorneys for Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. entered the
pleas Monday in two separate arraignments before U.S. District
Judge John D. Roberts. Each company has been charged with two
felonies and three misdemeanors.
   The two Feb. 27 indictments stem from the March 24, 1989, spill
of nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil from the
tanker Exxon Valdez, which ran aground and ripped its bottom open
on a charted reef outside shipping lanes in Prince William Sound.
   The oil coated hundreds of miles of coastline and killed
countless fish, birds and other marine life.

   The ice is breaking on northern Wisconsin
lakes, signaling the start of another tense spring when protesters
head to boat landings to confront Indians who use spears to catch
spawning fish.
   The first boats of Chippewa Indian spearfishers are expected to
venture onto off-reservation waters tonight to exercise a right
guaranteed by 19th century federal treaties.
   Despite pleas for peace, this spring's spearfishing season is
expected to renew confrontations between the Chippewa and sport
anglers, who claim spearfishing is an unfair, outdated practice
that thins game fish populations.
   Observers are unsure whether tensions will escalate from a year
ago, when more than 200 protesters were arrested and the state and
local sheriff's departments spent nearly $2 million to patrol the
lakes.

   Hundreds of Soviet Jews, the last group
to pass through this gateway to America, celebrated a Passover
dinner together in an atmosphere of joy and expectancy.
   ``It's the beginning of a new life,'' said Soviet-born Rabbi
Hirsch Rabiski, who led Monday evening's traditional Seder.
   The approximately 7,800 Soviet Jews staying in the Ladispoli
area near Rome are all to be resettled in the United States or
other countries by late May.
   Their departure marks the end of an era in which nearly all
Soviet Jews bound for the United States lived in this seaside area,
their applications handled at the main U.S. processing center in
Rome. Over time, Ladispoli became a symbol of the hope and despair
of Soviet Jewish refugees.

   The fact that no one has spent a day in jail
in the Iran-Contra scandal will work heavily in John Poindexter's
favor on sentencing day, legal observers say.
   ``I'm a great believer in the judge taking his cue from the jury
and in this case, the jury brought in the most severe sentence'' by
convicting Poindexter on all counts, said Paul Rothstein, a
Georgetown University law professor.
   But the fact that Oliver North didn't get any prison time
``militates a little bit against prison time for Poindexter,'' said
Rothstein, a past chairman of the American Bar Association's
criminal procedure committee.
   Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane and North both
were placed on two years' probation in the affair. McFarlane
pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors in the scandal and a jury
convicted North last year of three felonies.

   Engineers will let billions of hungry
microbes loose on tar-like waste left by an old gas works in hopes
of cleaning up the mess in three years, not the 1,000 nature would
need if left to itself.
   The stuff is on a site called Blekholmstorget, in the shadow of
the gold-tipped brick tower of Stockholm City Hall, where an
apartment and office complex is planned.
   Biotreatment of Cardiff, Wales, developed the use of microbes to
break down ground pollution, and the technique has been employed in
Britain and West Germany. This is the first use in a major cleanup
that does not involve hauling away the contaminated soil.
   Chief engineer Hans Kronberg said the goal is to purge
potentially cancer-causing grit from about 1.2 acres on the bank of
Lake Klara, a channel in Stockholm's interlocking chain of lakes.
Dozens of pleasure boats now dock there.
   A gas and coke factory was built on the site in 1852 and
operated for about 70 years. Most recently, the site was a parking
lot for the nearby central railway station.
   Kronberg said it took scientists nine months to identify
specific microbes that attack the pollutants involved. Bacteria
were taken from the site and fed oxygen and nutrients to help them
multiply.
   When the project begins in May, the plan is to filter
microbe-enriched water through the soil, which is soaked with
creosote, breaking down the tar-like waste.
   Grids of pipes spaced a few yards apart cover the site. Enriched
water will seep from one set of pipes and be collected by another
10 feet below. The water will be pumped to a container for
analysis, treated with nutrients and recycled into the pipes.
   ``As of this moment, we can't say if it will work or not,'' city
inspector Viveka Ehd-Falander said. ``We have never done this in
Sweden before.''
   Stockholm officials and federal environmental authorities see
the biological cleanup as a pilot project for opening hundreds of
polluted acres in the city to development.
   Kronberg, who works for the Skanska construction company, said
the creosote at Blekholmstorget was not a problem while it was
buried under the parking lot asphalt, but would become a threat
under a major housing development.
   Engineers fear the creosote would release harmful gases and
construction work would allow some of it to seep into the lake
water.
   Authorities are withholding some building permits until the area
is safe. Kronberg said the cleanup project adds about $6 milllion
to construction costs.
   ``If we didn't clean it up, the pollution would still be there
in 100 or 200 years when they rebuild this area again,'' the chief
engineer said.
   ``Hot spots,'' or small areas of highly concentrated creosote,
may contain up to 30,000 micrograms per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
pollutants. The number must be reduced to 200 micrograms for the
area to be declared safe.
   Land reclamation normally involves excavating polluted earth and
taking it to a safe dump, but that often endangers workers and
merely relocates the problem.
   About 26,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil would have to be
removed from Blekholmstorget, enough to bury a football field
nearly 10 feet deep.
   ``There are a lot of places in Stockholm where we'd like to
build,'' Ms. Ehd-Falander said. ``This is not the only place with
dirty soil. It's hard to dig everything up. We don't have places to
put it.''

<HEAD>Brazilians Struggle to Cope With With New Financial Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Pereira stared at the floor and
explained how his dream of owning a home was destroyed, or at least
postponed, by new government rules that won't let him spend his own
money.
   For 27 years, Pereira tucked something away in a savings account
each week so he could buy a home before retiring from his job as a
doorman.
   Last month, at 63, he had enough for the down payment on a
two-bedroom apartment.
   Something else happened last month. Fernando Collor de Mello
became president of Brazil on March 15 and took drastic action to
stop annual inflation of 4,850 percent.
   Banks closed for five days. New taxes were imposed. Utility
rates increased by 30 percent to 80 percent. Up to 80 percent of
the value of a savings or money market account was frozen for 18
months.
   ``All of a sudden, everything I worked for was gone,'' Pereira
said. ``How can I believe in anything anymore?''
   Brazilians are unable to get at their money and fear it will be
worth less when, and if, it is returned. Private companies lay off
workers in droves.
   Confidence is waning and optimism is turning to despair in a
vast nation of 150 million people that is potentially among the
world's richest, but polls show most Brazilians still are willing
to give Collor's ideas a chance.
   Miriam Santos de Lima, part-owner of a restaurant, has lost her
trust. ``The government lied to us,'' she said. ``Collor promised
he wouldn't touch our savings and he swept them into the government
safe. This is a disasterous start for a government pretending to be
honest and clean.''
   Confidence in banks is at an all-time low. People are turning to
the black market, stashing U.S. dollars in cabinets and under their
mattresses.
   Even under Collor's strict rules, anyone with a savings account
can withdraw the equivalent of $1,200. For money market accounts
and certificates of deposit, the limit is $600 or 20 percent,
whichever is greater.
   Nearly everyone seems to be using the opportunity.
   ``I'm taking all my money out of the bank because, if they took
the money of the biggies, ours will be next,'' housewife Rosa Marie
da Silva said, withdrawing the $100 in her account at the Banerj
bank in the hilltop Rocinha slum.
   A formerly hyperactive economy seems moribund.
   Consumers and manufacturers who furiously speculated, bought and
sold when inflation roared along at 200 percent a week now wait in
lines at banks to withdraw what they can to pay for overhead or
living expenses.
   Investments, debts, weddings, honeymoons _ all are on hold.
   Bartering is commonplace.
   An economist in Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial powerhouse,
traded his 1979 Volkswagon for the ownership rights to a telephone
line. A Sao Paulo housewife swapped a spare color television set
for a used stove.
   Neighbors trade rice, eggs or meat for deodorant, shampoo or
other items with unfrozen prices.
   Tens of thousands of Amazon prospectors see their dreams dashed
because the price of gold is plunging. Penniless miners are leaving
the jungle to seek work in cities, where there is none.
   Recession has hit the Rio sidewalk vendors.
   For three years, Jose Antonio Martins, 30, has supported his
wife and daughter by hawking everything from shaving brushes to
padlocks to panty hose in famed Carioca Square. Today, he worries
about paying his April apartment rent.
   ``I've cut my prices by a third, but no one's bought anything in
two days,'' he said.
   Dozens of ragged boys once lined the bustling square, shining
and repairing shoes. Carlinhos, a droopy eyed, barefoot beggar
flicked his wrist and said: ``They went. People forget about shoes
when things get tight.''
   Maria Elena da Silva advertised her car for sale in the Folha de
Sao Paulo. No replies.
   ``I knew it would be difficult to sell my car, but this is
ridiculous,'' she said. ``I'm asking half what I paid.''
   Cira Cochenga owns a ceramics shop in the outskirts of Sao Paulo
and has several months of orders backed up, but no cash to pay her
10 employees or buy supplies.
   ``My clients want to pay me with old money, cruzados, but I need
cruzeiros for production,'' said Ms. Cochenga, 39, who quit a
teaching job to open the business with her sister in 1986. ``It's
so frustrating, I'm about ready to go dig up clay in my backyard.''
   Unions say more than 200,000 Brazilians have been dismissed
because employers have no money to pay them, either because of
blocked funds or low sales.
   General Motors gave 18,000 workers 18 days paid leave because
the demand for cars has evaporated. Another 40,000 auto workers in
Brazil were laid off with pay indefinitely ane 160,000 were
required to take vacations early.
   Solidarity is growing between debtors and creditors. Some
restaurants, newspaper vendors and even cabbies run tabs for
regular customers.
   Many stores offer easy credit and discounts as high as 80
percent.
   When talk turns to the emergency measures, the comment is rarely
favorable.
   ``This plan is like stirring up cow manure,'' said Luciano de
Sousa Mattos, a 32-year-old street vendor. ``It's not going to
change anything, and later everything will just smell worse.''

<HEAD>NBC's CNBC To Start Second Year on Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next Tuesday, NBC's Consumer and Business News
Channel will celebrate its first birthday, still in the red _ and
expecting that for three more years _ but halfway, officials say,
to its goals of profitability and 30 million subscribers.
   But its growth, along with that of other new cable networks, is
threatened by the re-regulation of cable proposed in various bills
now pending in Congress, says Thomas S. Rogers, the overall boss of
CNBC.
   ``There is no single thing that could happen that would more
stunt the growth of CNBC than rate re-regulation,'' says Rogers,
president of NBC Cable and Business Development, referring to
regulation of the fees that cable operators charge consumers for
cable service.
   ``We might be stymied at some point, unable to reach our 30
million subscriber goal because of that,'' he says.
   The reason, Rogers says, is that if cable operators aren't
allowed to continue setting their own rates, they might hold off on
adding new services or expanding their number of channels.
   Virtually all cities with cable TV have had essentially
deregulated systems since 1985 because of a 1984 federal law that
freed local cable systems of rate regulation in communities served
by three or more broadcast stations.
   But now, with cable's strongest critics charging that it has
become an unregulated monopoly, the re-regulation proposals are in
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission is studying the
matter, too.
   The FCC study was required by the 1984 cable law, which, in an
odd twist, Rogers helped draft when he was a senior attorney on a
House telecommunications subcommittee. He joined NBC in 1987.
   CNBC, one of his first major projects, reportedly cost $65
million to start, although neither he nor NBC will comment on that.
   When the 24-hour channel began, offering Wall Street and
business news by day and talk shows of various sorts by night, many
reports described it as a rival to cable's established Financial
News Network, which began in 1981.
   But neither Rogers nor FNN President Michael Wheeler consider
their operations head-to-head competitors.
   ``What has probably been the most frustrating part of the first
year has been the incessant comparison to FNN as if what we were
about was launching a new financial service,'' Rogers says.
   Not so, he adds: ``It's first and foremost a consumer news
service.''
   Wheeler, whose service says it has 33 million subscribers,
considers CNBC primarily a rival of Ted Turner's Cable News
Network, specifically in the area of talk shows and consumer
programs.
   In prime time, when viewing levels are highest, ``we focus on
two subjects _buusiness and money,'' says Wheeler.
   Describing CNBC and FNN as bitter rivals may make a livelier
story, but ``that's irrelevant to us,'' Rogers says. ``We just want
to get on the dial.''
   That has proved a headache in the concrete island of Manhattan,
even though CNBC is based in nearby Fort Lee, N.J. FNN is seen in
Manhattan, but CNBC has yet to make its cable debut in that most
influential of markets.
   It's influential, Rogers notes, because it encompasses Wall
Street and ``is the hub of the financial community, the hub of the
media community, the hub of the advertising community and the
opinion-making community.''
   ``And if you're not visible there, people have no basis for
assessing you except by what they read ... and no basis for
evaluating what we are. And sure, that's a frustration and an issue
for us.''
   Richard Kostyra, an executive vice president at the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency, agrees it hurts CNBC not to be seen in
Manhattan.
   ``Out of sight, out of mind,'' he says, noting that as much as
advertising agencies work with research and numbers, it helps to be
regularly seen, to give ad executives a ``gut feel'' how the
channel works.
   Manhattan's two cable systems are controlled by Time Warner
Inc., one of the nation's cable giants. The company also owns
cable's Home Box Office, whose The Comedy Channel debuted on cable
last November.
   Rogers said Time Warner _ whose Comedy Channel isn't seen yet,
either, in Manhattan _ ``has been less than interested in
supporting our service. ... The excuse we were given originally was
that they don't have channel capacity.''
   Now, he says, their systems are being upgraded and channel
capacity being increased by the end of this year, ``so we're
hopeful that we'll get added.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ART AND MONEY: FNN has been showing a Monday series on investing
in art, ``Art Market Report.'' But the half-hour series has been
revamped and given both a new title and a broader scope that
includes efforts to understand art.
   With Vincent Price as its new host, the revised show premiered
this month with the kinder, less pecuniary title of ``Appreciating
Art.''

<HEAD>Still A Future For Smaller Company Stocks?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The poor performance of smaller-company stocks
has been receiving a lot of attention these days and some of their
supporters are ready to throw in the towel.
   Examining the record, they might have good reason to do so,
because these so-called smaller stocks, some in companies with
sales under $50 million a year, have trailed the gains made by the
big brand-name companies since 1983.
   That performance casts much doubt on a thesis held dear by some
stock market analysts, that smaller stocks tend to produce stronger
gains than the very largest stocks.
   The belief received strong academic support in 1978, when Rolf
Banz, a University of Chicago researcher, traced the relative
performances for 50 years and found that the idea wasn't just in
the imagination but in the numbers too.
   A variety of explanations were offered in subsequent years to
justify the findings, including the obvious one, that smaller
companies tend to grow faster than larger ones.
   Banz, however, found that even after accounting for the greater
risk there was a small-stock premium.
   The theorists then pointed out that the largest stocks were so
closely examined by so many analysts that just about everything was
known about them. Therefore, the market was efficient in respect to
such stocks.
   Smaller stocks are not closely followed and so tend to be less
efficiently priced. With smaller stocks there always are surprises.
A stunning bargain might be found simply because the word hasn't
gotten around.
   That sounded plausible. Also containing the ring of truth was
the assertion that large institutional buyers, the big pension and
mutual funds and their kin who support the blue chips, are too
large to buy into smaller companies.
   Too large? Yes, because it is inefficient for them to buy the
small amounts of stock that smaller companies have available.
   To illustrate: They can buy a few million dollars in shares of
General Motors without greatly affecting the price, but a smaller
company probably wouldn't even have that many shares available.
Moreover, such purchases would distort the price. The smaller
company simply couldn't accommodate them.
   Many other possibilities also were offered, but now there is a
tendency to dismiss the entire thesis.
   Smaller stocks, it is said, have been so well discovered that
their market is now efficient. Moreover, while huge institutions
still cannot invest in them, mutual funds have been created just
for that purpose.
   But hold on, says former Professor Gerald Perritt, now
proprietor of Investment Information Services, a Chicago research
and investment advisory firm that is widely recognized as an
authority on small-business stocks.
   Perritt stakes his reputation on the idea that the small-stock
premium still exists. He contends that the poor performance since
1983 is understandable, in view of the earlier runup in prices for
the small-stock sector.
   From 1975, when the small-stock affect was attracting attention,
to about mid-1983, when the premium was most noticeable, the per
share prices of smaller companies rose several times more than per
share prices of blue chips.
   By then, the smaller company stocks were overpriced, says
Perritt. They had attracted so much attention that investors had
bid them beyond their true value. A lot of the earlier investors
wanted to take their profits.
   At the same time, a different pattern developed among individual
investors. More and more during the 1980s they chose to invest
through conventional mutual funds. Traditionally, these funds
invest in blue chips.
   Enormous sums flowed into these mutual funds, and pension funds
too, and they and other institutional investors put the money into
blue chips, pushing up prices and making the small companies appear
even more laggard.
   Meanwhile, Perritt found that the small-stock premium never was
consistent. ``The excess returns provided by these stocks tend to
run in streaks, the last of which began in 1975 and ended in
1983,'' he says.
   Since then, so many smaller stocks have been ignored that he
believes they might be underpriced. Time for another streak, he
says, adding:
   ``Given the stones being cast at small-firm stocks, this sector
of the market is a contrarian investor's dream.''

   Engineers will let billions of hungry
microbes loose on tar-like waste left by an old gas works in hopes
of cleaning up the mess in three years, not the centuries nature
would need if left to itself.
   The stuff is on a site called Blekholmstorget, in the shadow of
the gold-tipped brick tower of Stockholm City Hall, where an
apartment and office complex is planned.

<HEAD>Crimes Over Clothing Prompt Schools' Return to Dress Codes,
Uniforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a modern urban phenomenon: kids robbing _
and sometimes killing _ other kids over the hottest designer
sneakers, sunglasses or athletic jackets.
   In Chicago alone, four young men have died in little more a year
over multi-colored, satiny jackets with splashy team logos across
the back.
   Those not dying for their clothing might instead be robbed.
   On an icy day this winter, an 11-year-old boy was forced to hand
over his $61 gym shoes to four youths, then walk the several blocks
to his home barefoot, one of scores of incidents that occur each
month, police say.
   ``Kids who try to keep their jackets are beaten or killed,''
said Sollie Vincent, commander of the Gang Crimes Section of the
Chicago police. ``It's a very cold, callous frame of mind.''
   To combat the problem, schools from Baltimore to Miami to Los
Angeles are falling back on an old idea: dress codes.
   Some public schools even have instituted uniforms, traditionally
associated with parochial schools.
   ``It's a definite trend,'' said Tim Callahan, a spokesman for
the National Association of State Boards of Education. ``Kids are
going to learn best in an environment free of undue, inappropriate
pressures, and certainly one that's free of violence.
   ``If clothing becomes a disruption to education, then we
certainly are supportive of removing that barrier,'' he said.
   ``Starter'' jackets _ athletic jackets named for their
manufacturer, Starter Sportswear Inc. of New Haven, Conn. _ have
sparked numerous crimes in Chicago, including four murders, police
say.
   In a grim acknowledgement of the garment's popularity, the
police department last year created a separate category for
``Starter jacket murders'' in its citywide statistics.
   ``We are hoping these are isolated situations that are not
long-term,'' said Thomas McAuliffe, human resources director for
Starter. ``We have a responsible attitude towards the communities
in which we have operations.''
   Educators say dress codes that eliminate some popular items and,
in some cases, gang colors, not only help stem violence but allow
students to concentrate on learning.
   ``We try to discourage children from buying hot items,'' says
Jim Murray, assistant principal at a middle school in Chicago's
troubled Englewood neighborhood. ``When they don't wear those items
to school, they don't have problems.''
   ``We have found that, subtly, it is changing attitudes,''
Alberta Mitchell, counselor at Hendricks Academy, said of the
Chicago public elementary school's new uniform policy.
   ``The children are not supposed to wear gym shoes, so that
eliminates the problem of buying brand-name gym shoes symbolizing
status,'' Miss Mitchell said. ``We are trying to eliminate the
problem of children feeling like they have to have designer-type
clothes. It seems to have a calming effect.''
   In Chicago, as in many of the nation's largest school districts,
dress codes are the prerogative of individual schools.
   In Baltimore, uniforms are recommended, although not mandatory,
for elementary school students, and a dress code is suggested for
secondary schools. Educators say uniforms now are the norm at 74 of
the city's 118 elementary schools.
   School officials can't recall any crimes over clothing since the
policy was instituted last fall, and Baltimore police say the
problem virtually has disappeared.
   ``It still happens, but not with any frequency,'' said police
spokesman Dennis Hill.
   Next fall, high schools in Detroit will have the option of
adopting a dress code. The new policy by Detroit's Board of
Education was prompted in part by the December shooting of a
student over his $135 goose-down jacket.
   Detroit police say crimes over clothing are on the decline.
   ``It's not like the old days 10 years ago,'' said Sgt.
Christopher Buck.
   In New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a high school
principal earlier this year barred students from wearing removable
gold caps on their teeth, saying the faddish caps were robberies
waiting to happen.
   But the new policies have not been cheered in all quarters.
   In March, high school students in Palmdale, Calif., enraged by a
new anti-gang dress code, boycotted classes and pelted a sheriff's
patrol car with rocks.
   And there is some support for student resistance to the
dress-code trend.
   Laws allowing schools to require uniforms are ``a way of trying
to see that all students look alike, act alike and think alike,''
said Jane Whicher, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union in Illinois.
   ``It's important for children to have an appreciation of their
own individuality as well as the constitutional values that protect
that individuality,'' she said. ``Orthodoxy in apparel is not
something a school board should be involved in.''
   Requiring uniforms might also pose a financial hurdle for the
poor, Whicher said, but some families are applauding the trend.
   ``Parents seem to really like the idea,'' said Shel Erlich, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's
second-largest public school system. ``It certainly cuts down the
amount of arguing in the morning over what the kids should wear to
school.''
   And some parents are instituting their own dress codes when the
schools are not.
   ``I have two daughters, one a senior in high school,'' said
Charles Hill, who heads security for 40 Chicago schools. ``We don't
entertain the thought of a Starter jacket.
   ``We want our kids to have everything,'' he said, ``but we don't
want our kids to have something that endangers their lives.''
   Law enforcement officials welcome the move toward dress codes.
   ``Any way that a kid can avoid the problem seems rational to
me,'' said Vincent, of the gang crime unit. ``Parents would be a
little kinder to their kids if they deprived them of the things
they beg for.''

   Here is a list of some school systems that are
considering or have recently instituted policies restricting dress
or requiring school uniforms:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BALTIMORE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Baltimore City Public Schools recommend that elementary students
wear uniforms. Officials say 74 of 118 elementary schools and a
handful of middle schools have taken the recommendation.
   At high schools, an exclusionary dress code is in effect,
barring furs and leathers, clothing with ``vulgar and obscene''
printed material, and gold chains and other precious-metal jewelry.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHICAGO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's dress code ``is broad, open-ended, and deliberately
so,'' with students required to wear ``appropriate attire,'' said
spokesman Bob Saigh.
   Some elementary schools, under the guidance of local school
councils, have introduced school uniforms, and some high schools
have banned certain items of apparel. At one South Side high
school, students recently were barred from wearing T-shirts and
sweaters printed with gang emblems.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DALLAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   No Dallas Independent School District schools require uniforms,
but board members in March discussed introducing a pilot uniform
program at one of the district's 180 schools.
   The board also is considering broadening the dress code in
effect since the early 1970s. Basically, students are on their own,
as long as their clothing isn't hazardous or disruptive.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DETROIT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Three elementary schools ask students to ``dress uniformly'' in
white shirts and solid-color skirts or pants. All schools are
working on new guidelines for student attire, which are to be sent
to the board later this month.
   Some schools already have updated their dress codes, including
Mumford High, which says it is working to avoid ``a materialistic
society which ascribes higher status to monetary symbols than to
intellectual prowess.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LOS ANGELES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Los Angeles, where dress codes are handled on a
school-by-school basis, some have barred students from wearing
colors associated with certain gangs, said spokesman Shel Erlich.
   A small number of elementary schools have instituted voluntary
school-uniform policies because ``parents felt they wanted their
kids not to be ... put down as not as affluent as other kids,''
Erlich said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIAMI:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forty-two of about 170 elementary schools in the Dade County
Public School System, which includes Miami, have gone to uniforms
in the past two years, ``the idea being to encourage kids not to be
so caught up in fashion,'' said spokesman Andy Gollan.
   High school students are subject to a minimal dress code that
requires they ``look neat,'' with no T-shirts or sandals, he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEW YORK:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``There is no dress code, period,'' said Frank Sobrino, a
spokesman for New York's school system. But schools that wish to
introduce uniforms may do so, if parents are consulted and agree to
the plan. Students at a handful of elementary and junior high
schools now wear uniforms.
   Some high schools have taken other measures, such as banning
gold jewelry or the removable gold caps some students wore on their
teeth.

<HEAD>Rattan Smugglers Try to Evade Export Ban</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Single name for Suharto cq</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't put your nest egg into rattan
baskets and try to ship them out of the country. You might be
arrested for smuggling.
   Not only that. When the problem first appeared, Attorney General
Sukarton Marmosudjono said: ``I may have to use the subversion law
and threaten smugglers with the death penalty.''
   Three shipping containers filled with loosely woven baskets were
impounded recently. Their owners, not identified, were accused of
trying to sneak raw rattan out of Indonesia in the form of finished
goods, which can be exported legally.
   Officials said the baskets were to be dismantled in another
country and the rattan crafted into more valuable products.
   A government prosecutor demanded life in prison and a fine of 30
million rupiahs ($16,593) for H.W. Ng, who was charged with
illegally exporting almost 2,000 tons of raw rattan to Hong Kong
and Taiwan.
   Ng fled Indonesia before the court delivered the sentence
demanded by the prosecution.
   Indonesian jungles produce more than 80 percent of the world's
rattan. Vines of the long, flexible wood, which grows wild, once
were exported in huge quantities to be made into wicker furniture,
baskets and other items.
   Wicker is a catchall term for items woven of rattan, reed, cane,
dried grasses and other flexible materials, even twisted paper.
Rattan, willow and bamboo are the most popular natural fibers,
according to industry sources in Jakarta.
   After timber, rattan is the most important forest product in
Southeast Asia. Despite its near-monopoly, Indonesia made
relatively little money from rattan because it exported only the
low-value raw material, not such finished products as furniture.
   Foreign manufacturers, most of them in Taiwan, Hong Kong and
China, made the real profits.
   To change that, the government imposed a ban in late 1986 on the
export of raw rattan. A later decree specified that semi-processed
vines and cane- webbing could leave the country only in the form of
furniture or other finished products.
   The Philippines banned raw rattan exports in 1977, Thailand in
March 1977 and Peninsular Malaysia last year.
   Indonesia's purpose was to develop manufacturing industries that
would make rattan furniture and create jobs.
   Similar methods were used to force the growth of a domestic
plywood industry. After a ban was imposed on the export of uncut
hardwood logs in 1985, Indonesia became the world's leading source
of plywood.
   ``We are the world's biggest exporter of plywood, and in the
near future it is hoped that this will be followed by the export of
finished goods made of rattan, which is a natural resource
possessed by few other countries,'' President Suharto said.
   Criticism of the ban came from the European Community, United
States and others. They pointed out that Indonesia was a member of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which discourages
non-tariff barriers.
   Some critics said the ban was imposed before Indonesia had
established itself as a producer of quality finished products.
Sophisticated marketing methods were neglected by a government that
had viewed rattan goods as handicraft, a cottage industry.
   Stockpiling of raw rattan before the ban and smuggling since
gave foreign manufacturers a few years of breathing space. New
sources of supply are being developed in Vietnam and Papua New
Guinea, but those who want to continue using Indonesian rattan
legally must invest in plants within the country.
   Officials say Indonesia has 280 rattan processing companies,
compared with 33 in late 1986. More than $250 million has been
invested in new factories and more than 80,000 jobs provided, they
say.
   Indonesia exported about 70,000 tons of raw rattan annually
before the ban. It brought in $63 million in 1985 and exports of
semi-finished rattan brought total earnings to $86 million.
   Last year, rattan exports earned more than $330 million.

   Trusting the Earth's problems to politicians, industry and
scientists is not enough.
   Environmentalists say everyone has the power to help protect
resources and clean up the air, water and land by shopping wisely
and disposing of garbage carefully. Doing dozens of little things,
they say, can make a big difference.
   Individuals can also keep pressuring government and industry to
reduce pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, the
disappearance of resources and the rapid extinction of wildlife
species.
   ``You have the ability to affect your environment individually,
and you have the ability to do even more working collectively,''
said Tina Hobson, executive director of Renew America, a
Washington, D.C. foundation that monitors and encourages
environmental programs around the country.
   Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich, an expert on
ecology, says the most important thing individuals can do is to
become informed and become involved.
   ``There's a lot you can do as an individual in things like
recycling, but none of that is going to work unless you get
involved in political action that gets at the core problems, gets
at the basic diseases rather than the symptoms,'' he said.
   The basic problem is ``the scale of human activities relative to
what can be supported by the natural systems of the planet.''
   Ehrlich, the author of 1968's ``The Population Bomb'' and, most
recently, ``The Population Explosion,'' warned that too many
people, too much consumption and too much damage by the technology
that supplies the items consumed are creating a world out of whack
and headed for disaster.
   But disaster is not inevitable. People have plenty of ways to
make life safer and healthier. Some even save money.
   The main guidelines are to reduce consumption; be energy
efficient at home, work and while traveling; don't waste water,
fuel or other resources; avoid products or actions harmful to the
environment, and recycle anything that can be used again.
Disposable is out, reusable is in.
   Save paper. Start with this newspaper. Recycling it can help
save a tree.
   ``Depending on what newspapers you read, you could be using up
one tree every 10 or 12 weeks,'' according to Marjorie Lamb's book,
``Two Minutes a Day for a Greener Planet.''
   She notes that Canada, which supplies almost all the world's
newsprint, each year cuts down 247,000 more acres of trees than it
replants. The United States loses an acre of forest every 5
seconds. Nearly half what Americans throw away is paper.
   Lamb suggests other ways to save trees, such as reusing
envelopes by sticking labels over old addresses, reusing gift
boxes, using rags instead of paper towels, and using permanent
coffee filters instead of throwaway filters.
   People can also ask for recycled paper at stationers and
printers, use cloth napkins instead of paper and cloth diapers
instead of disposables.
   It's better, however, to use paper shopping bags than plastic,
better yet to avoid any bag when buying just a few items. Kids can
do their part by wrapping school lunches in paper rather than
plastic or aluminum foil, and using lunch boxes instead of a new
bag each day.
   Save water.
   The United Nations ``Personal Action Guide for the Earth'' urges
people to install faucet aerators and water-efficient shower heads,
which use half to one-fifth as much water. Each 10-minute shower
with such a device can use up to 50 gallons less water.
   The U.N. guide also suggests people turn off the water while
shaving, brushing teeth or scrubbing clothes; fix leaky pipes,
valves or faucets promptly; use low-flush toilets; run washing
machines and dishwashers only when full, and cut down on
car-washing and lawn-watering.
   Save the air.
   Many scientists believe the Earth's protective ozone layer is
being depleted by chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerators, air
conditioners, certain aerosols, plastic foam insulation, solvents
and halon fire extinguishers. Ozone depletion increases the
likelihood of skin cancer, global climate change, decreased crop
yields and disruption of the marine food chain, according to the
U.N. Environmental Program.
   Consumers should avoid aerosols and other products containing
CFCs, ask local governments to collect and recycle CFCs from old
refrigerators and air conditioners, and ask auto service stations
to use equipment that captures CFCs during air conditioner repairs.
   The U.N. guide also suggests avoiding clothes that require dry
cleaning, which uses toxic chlorinated solvents.
   Save fuel.
   Earth Day organizers advise people to walk or use public
transportation, carpools or bicycles, and invest in ample
insulation, weatherstripping and caulking.
   Turning down thermostats a few degrees in winter and wearing
warmer clothes also can save energy and money. In summer, set the
air conditioner a few degrees higher than usual. Do not heat or
cool unused rooms, and use insulating shades and curtains on cold
winter nights and hot summer days.
   Save food.
   Animals raised for food in the United States eat enough grain to
feed more than five times the U.S. population. Consider how such
food production affects the environment and eat lower on the food
chain _ vegetables, fruits and grains, advises the Utne Reader
magazine of Minneapolis.
   If Americans ate 10 percent less meat, the 12 million tons of
grain saved annually could feed all the people in the world who now
starve to death each year, according to the United Nations.
   Learn vegetarian recipes and encourage restaurants to serve
vegetarian foods. Organize potluck dinners and be creative with
leftovers. Buy organic food, but don't buy foods out of season.
Grow a garden rather than a lawn and plant fruit and nut trees.
   Recycle.
   People without local recycling programs should encourage
neighbors and officials to start one, says Renew America's Hobson.
The group provides information on the best programs in the country,
which can be used as models.
   Recycling is not limited to paper, cans and glass and plastic
bottles. You can also recycle used oil, tires, scrap metal, scrap
wood, car batteries, mattresses, corrugated cardboard, aluminum and
organic waste.
   The United States produces more than 11 billion tons of
nonhazardous solid waste each year, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency. If trucks carried away one ton each, that annual
accumulation of solid waste would fill 14,000 lanes of trucks
bumper to bumper from New York to Los Angeles.
   Industry generates the greatest current in the waste stream, an
estimated 7.6 billion tons. Much of that is disposed on-site with
little scrutiny or regulation. Workers and nearby residents can
urge companies to recycle.
   More than 100 million pounds of plastic are discarded into
oceans every year, according to the World Society for the
Protection of Animals. Plastic six-pack rings strangle or fatally
maim many birds and animals that become entangled in them.
   ``As consumers and citizens, we certainly make a lot of choices,
about the things we use, the stores we shop in and the people we
vote for,'' said Denise Fort, executive director of Citizens for a
Better Environment in San Francisco.
   ``We can make a huge difference. There are some things we have
to look to government to do. We need to demand that government
representatives act responsibly and clean up the environment. But a
lot can be done with individual action.''

<TEXT>
   Cities, states and companies often complain they don't have the
money to solve environmental problems, but they've learned through
painful experience that the alternative _ ignoring them _ is even
more expensive.
   After several environmental disasters over the last year, and
with the nation's attention turned toward Earth Day on April 22,
scientists, politicians and business leaders are looking at things
local governments can do now to save money in the future.
   ``We can't afford not to spend the money to clean up the
environment,'' said Dianne Feinstein, former San Francisco mayor
and now a gubernatorial contender. ``If we don't invest in waste
water treatment, solid waste treatment, sewage systems, recycling
plants, mass transit, it'll cost us billions or trillions in the
future to clean up everything.''
   That message was driven home in places around the country faced
with the cleanup of hazardous wastes in dumpsites and of pesticides
and other toxic chemicals in groundwater.
   Disasters such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and
February's spill off Huntington Beach in Southern California have
brought calls for stricter laws to prevent accidents and clean up
messes quickly when they occur.
   The oil industry and others that use toxic chemicals are
starting to get the message.
   ``Our feeling is $1 of prevention is worth $10 or $100 years
later,'' said Mac Jeffery, environmental spokesman for IBM. ``We're
establishing manufacturing facilities that clean up problems at the
source.''
   Local governments learned not to count on the federal government
during the Reagan years and are taking a wait-and-see attitude
toward the Bush administration, which is supporting a new, stronger
clean air bill.
   Officials in New York, California, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon and other environmentally
progressive states are passing tough laws as well as seeking closer
cooperation with industry.
   ``Most of the environmental work is being done at the local and
state levels,'' said Tom Jorling, commissioner of the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation. ``There's been very
little initiative coming from the federal government.''
   Paul Ehrlich, Stanford biologist and one of the nation's best
known ecologists, has surprisingly kind words for industry.
   ``Industry has already done a lot,'' he said. ``A lot of the
increase in our energy efficiency over the past 20 years has been a
response of industry to the fact that energy is no longer to be
viewed as a free good.
   ``I have a lot more hope for industry than I have for the
federal government. We've had nine years of going backward there.''
   Jorling said New York state officials, rather than relying only
on statutes, are working with IBM, based in Armonk, and Eastman
Kodak Co., in Rochester, to develop agreements on their use of
toxic chemicals.
   ``And it's not just those two,'' Jorling said. ``I just sat down
with 60 oil firms _ they know they've got to perform better and
we're trying to figure out ways for them to do that.
   ``No longer are companies sitting back waiting for public policy
to develop,'' he said. ``Now they realize they have to be involved.
The big difference between the original Earth Day in 1970 and Earth
Day 1990 is that now industry recognizes the environmental issue is
not a passing fad. It's here to stay and must be part of the way of
doing business.''
   Getting businesses involved in preventing environmental damage
and shaping legislation doesn't mean states are letting industry
dictate terms.
   ``States must develop good, high quality environmental
programs,'' Jorling said. ``Without that lever and credibility
they're going to be whipsawed by industry. Industry doesn't respect
weakness, it respects strength.''
   San Francisco-based Chevron Corp., which promotes an image of
environmental concern but has been cited for toxic spills into the
bay and emissions into the air at its Richmond, Calif., refinery,
is wary of state officials.
   ``We seem to have more mavericks at the state level than the
federal level,'' said Lyn Arscott, Chevron's general manager of
health, environment and loss prevention. He complained about
actions by the state attorney general and a legal system that
allows ``some not very sensible initiatives to pop up in
California.''
   Arscott said Chevron recognizes ``the oil industry does not
enjoy a high level of credibility'' because of Valdez and Chevron's
refinery explosion.
   ``We're trying hard to improve our performance,'' he said. ``We
hope the public will meet us halfway. ... We'd like to encourage
(using) market forces in the regulatory process. Historically,
(government) has wanted to command and control. The law comes on
from up high with big fines. We'd like to set up some general
guidelines and then have a system of incentives.''
   Jorling said the biggest ``recalcitrants'' in the corporate
world are in the auto industry.
   ``They say they can't meet requirements on emission standards,
can't build cars with better gas mileage, but it's crucial that
they be turned around because of their huge effect on the
environment _ energy use, global warming, air pollution,'' Jorling
said. ``They're still back somewhere in the heyday of the robber
barons.''
   Top priorities for the 1990s, Jorling said, are the production
of durable, fuel-efficient cars and the eventual ``weaning from
fossil fuels'' to alternatives such as solar energy.
   Ehrlich said the government ought to jack up gasoline taxes
``until we're paying $3 a gallon, like the Europeans do.''
   ``You'd have to compensate poor people to make sure they can
still get to work,'' he said. ``But you'd raise a lot of revenue.
You'd help the global warming problem and other air pollution
problems, and save the roads and bridges by using fewer cars and
more efficient late-model cars.''

   The ideals they seek are the bedrock of America:
freedom to worship without persecution, the chance for a better
life, opportunities for their children. In greater numbers than
ever, Soviet Jews are coming here at a time of convulsive change in
their homeland. ``If you have these changes and people continue to
run away, it's a very bad sign,'' said emigre Sophie Spektor.
``It's like leaving a sinking ship.''

   Ten years ago, Eugeny Bragarnik gave up on
Soviet promises of a workers' paradise to pursue the American dream.
   Bragarnik started out as a cab driver. He now owns a restaurant
and a three-bedroom house, drives an Audi, has a son in college,
jogs five miles a day on a seaside boardwalk and loves ``Three's
Company'' reruns on cable.
   He has little interest in Soviet upheaval, even if the communist
monopoly of seven decades is ending, Lithuania leads restive
republics seeking independence, Armenians war with Azerbaijanis,
and Eastern bloc tyrants have tumbled like the Berlin Wall.
   ``I don't think about that government. It's past. It's gone,''
said Bragarnik. ``Everything I have is over here. My soul is here.
Most of the time, I am thinking about this government.''
   At Bragarnik's Odessa Restaurant, nestled among the delis and
fast food joints typical of any American neighborhood, an
eight-piece band featuring two Russian singers competes with the
flat music of video games in the lobby.
   Supper tables are set with shot glasses for gulping down icy
Stolychnaya vodka, and patrons are welcomed by a spread worthy of
an Old World wedding reception: borscht, shish-kabob,
cabbage-stuffed piroshki and pelmini, a spicy, ravioli-like dish.
   The linking of East and West occurs throughout Brighton Beach, a
25-block pocket in Brooklyn within commuting distance of the Statue
of Liberty and adjacent to Coney Island's roller coaster and
parachute jump.
   The neighborhood, the largest concentration of Soviets in the
United States, is called Little Odessa for the Black Sea port in
the Ukraine where many of its residents once lived.
   Brighton Beach's newsstands boast the Cyrillic headlines of the
only Russian-language daily newspaper in the Western Hemisphere,
and newcomers tune in to Russian-language TV and radio shows.
   The Black Sea Book Store carries Russian mysteries, novels and
science fiction _ but not Mikhail Gorbachev's ``Perestroika,'' the
Soviet president's plan for overhauling the country.
   The argot of Odessa, Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev can be heard
among the clusters of people who visit the boardwalk, wearing fur
hats and head scarves called babushkas.
   Everything, it seems, has a Russian flavor except politics.
These latter-day pilgrims are too busy chasing capitalistic prizes
like TVs and cars to worry about riots in Tadzhikistan or long
lines for toilet paper.
   ``Some people get homesick, but there is a new medicine for
people who suffer from nostalgia,'' said Sophie Spektor, who left
Odessa for Brighton Beach 15 years ago. ``It's the $3,000 ticket.
You go back and you become well in a hurry. You won't be nostalgic
anymore.''
   Since 1972, when Richard Nixon's policies of detente thawed
Soviet-American relations, about 35,000 mostly Jewish refugees have
come to Brighton Beach to flee hatred and bigotry. Most settle in
plain brick tenements that look as if they were stamped out by the
same cookie cutter.
   This year, more Soviet Jews than ever are coming to America.
Gorbachev's reforms made it easier for them to leave, but the open
society is a doubled-edged sickle that made the Jews who remain
targets of hatred and bigotry by some Russian nationalists.
   ``This is the largest wave ever of Soviet Jewish refugees in
modern times. They are really running scared. As a group, they are
a persecuted minority,'' said Mark Handelman of the New York
Association for New Americans, a resettlement agency that helps pay
housing and living expenses.
   Last year, 36,147 Soviet Jews were admitted to the United
States, and 40,000 are expected this year, according to the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society. That's up from 10,576 in 1988 and only 570
in 1985, Gorbachev's first year in power.
   About half the new arrivals stay in the New York area.
   The 1.4 million Jews living in the Soviet Union fear pogroms, or
organized racial attacks. Jews say biases prohibit them from
holding government jobs, getting promotions or gaining admission to
universities. For them, Lenin's promise of a workers' paradise is
as empty as most Soviet stores' shelves.
   ``There's an ancient history of anti-Semitism. It's in the
mother's milk of every Russian,'' said Pauline Bilus, director of
Action for Russian Immigrants, a service agency based in Brighton
Beach.
   ``People are voting with their feet. They're breaking the doors
down to get out of there. There's a palpable fear. You can touch
it, taste it,'' she said.
   Svetlana Uriadko, who came here 13 years ago, said things seemed
worse when she visited the Soviet Union in 1988.
   ``On the street, you can hear people yelling, `Jew, Jew, go out
from the country.' It's intolerable,'' Mrs. Uriadko said. ``There
is nothing in the store. No cheese. No meat. No bologna. No wurst.
No eggs. The people steal. They hoard. They have black markets.
   ``America gave me a second birth. Here, only here, I started
believing in God,'' she said. ``Gorbachev is to be complimented for
one thing. In the heart of communism, he pronounced communism
doesn't work. He tore off the false mask.''
   Among the refugees, Gorbachev gets mixed reviews. They're
grateful he allows more Jews to leave, but many believe the reforms
may be too late. Even the most cynical, though, concede the changes
have gone too far to turn back.
   The one-party rule dictated after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution
has given way to multiparty elections. In a nod toward capitalism,
factory ownership is allowed. Communist Party cards have been
burned in freedom marches.
   ``Nobody expected in our lives there would be such changes,''
said barber Abe Rud, 52, between $6 haircuts in his Brighton Beach
shop.
   ``It's gone too far,'' Rud said. ``It couldn't go back. You
would have to have a thousand, thousand tanks to turn it back. What
are you going to do, kill people in the streets?''
   Once settled in, these new Americans tend to be conservative in
their politics and lifestyles.
   ``Most of them are Republicans,'' said Pat Singer of the
Brighton Neighborhood Association. ``They loved Reagan. They want
toughness. They want someone to stand up to the Russians.''
   Some traits die hard, especially when it comes to asking for
government assistance for housing and food stamps.
   ``They know how to fight a bureaucracy. They never give up. They
even bring crummy presents, like Russian perfume that smells like
mothballs, to cut through the red tape,'' said Ruth Paris of the
Council of Jewish Organizations of Flatbush. ``None of them has any
love for Russia.''

   Many sound like American parents fretting about drugs, crime and
kids wearing wild clothes and too much makeup.
   ``They cannot accept laxity and the lack of discipline in
schools,'' said Rabbi Yechezkel Pikus of the Council of Jewish
Organizations. ``They feel you can get away with murder because the
penal system is so ineffective.''
   The new arrivals laugh about getting dizzy in American stores
because their heads spin so fast trying to look at all the
merchandise.
   After chafing under a government that dictated everything, they
must learn to take the initiative for the first time in their lives.
   ``People are not accustomed to making their own decisions,''
said Helen Lomosova, who has been in the United States for less
than a year. ``The system was arranged so that somebody always told
you what to do.''
   Mrs. Lomosova, 60, once taught English to pupils in the Ukraine;
now she teaches English to refugees who squeeze into elementary
school chairs at P.S. 225.
   She taps her toe to give rhythm and cadence to the strange words
being mouthed by a nurse, a violinist and a sheet metal worker
struggling to say their names, addresses and phone numbers in
English.
   ``Only English is spoken here,'' she tells them, in a tone that
suggests a teacher's admonitions are the same in any language.
``Never say `cannot.' Always say, `I'll try' or `I will.' ''
   Other lessons are more subliminal. Mrs. Lomosova begins each
class with the patriotic words of a cherished U.S. verse.
   As the students say words they may not yet fully appreciate, she
repeats the final line for emphasis: ``God bless America, my home,
sweet home.''

   Soviet emigre Sarah Rudman proudly speaks two
words in English: ``America good.''
   It's quite a statement for someone starting life over, both she
and her husband unable to work because they are crippled, living in
a barren apartment an ocean and a continent away from their
homeland.
   The Rudmans, both 64, have a hand-me-down bed without sheets, a
folding table, two chairs, two lamps, a 13-inch portable TV and one
curtain for two windows. All the furnishings were either donated,
left over or scrounged.
   ``I never had many things. Books and spiritual things are much
more valuable than material things,'' Mrs. Rudman said through an
interpreter. ``We didn't think everything will fall from the sky.
I'm happy with what I have.'' She gained something worth more than
home furnishings, so she doesn't mind using a corner of her bed as
a sofa.
   ``We wanted to be free and not be persecuted because we are
Jewish,'' she said. ``We wanted our kids to be free, to get an
education. People here are really free. They can express
themselves. They can observe any religion they want to. Everybody
does what he wants.''
   Mrs. Rudman, who taught kindergarten in Odessa, hasn't left the
apartment since her Dec. 20 arrival in Brighton Beach. She's laid
up with a bad back, a condition stemming from typhoid fever
contracted during World War II when she was evacuated to Siberia to
escape invading Nazis.
   Her husband, Lazar, was a shoemaker until he suffered a
disabling head injury in a 1983 streetcar accident. He also was
mugged before leaving the Soviet Union and walks with a cane.
   The Rudmans came to America with a daughter and her three
children. Another daughter stayed behind because her child had
meningitis, and she hopes to emigrate later this year. Until then,
they are reluctant to talk about Soviet life.
   As refugees, the Rudmans are entitled to food stamps, welfare
and federal rent subsidies. They also get money for rent and food
from the New York Association for New Americans, which gets the
bulk of its support from United Jewish Appeal.
   Nevertheless, they had to borrow money from relatives and other
immigrants to pay their $525 monthly rent. They were too proud at
first to seek government help.
   ``We're a little embarrassed,'' Mrs. Rudman said.
   The Rudmans, who first applied to leave the Soviet Union in
1978, learn English through a paperback translation book or by
watching cartoons and other TV shows.
   ``I am afraid of nothing. A person dies only once,'' Mrs. Rudman
said defiantly.
   Then she clasped her hands in a gesture of prayer and said in
broken English, ``America good. So very good.''

<HEAD>California Insurance Regulators Deny French Bid for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State regulators dealt a crippling blow to
Sir James Goldsmith's attempted $21 billion buyout of Britain's BAT
Industries PLC by rejecting a proposed French takeover of the
Farmers insurance companies.
   BAT, Britain's largest conglomerate, owns Farmers Group Inc.
Goldsmith, the Anglo-French takeover specialist, had proposed to
sell Farmers to Axa-Midi Assurances of France upon acquiring BAT.
   Farmers, the largest California-based insurer and the third
largest auto and homeowner insurer in the United States, had
maintained that Axa-Midi was too small and too inexperienced in the
U.S. market to take Farmers over. Axa-Midi has about $8 billion in
premium revenues, a bit more than Farmers.
   In order for Goldsmith to proceed with his bid, the British
Takeover Panel has said he must gain clearance for his plans for
Farmers in each of the nine states in which Farmers operates an
insurance company.
   On Monday, California regulators ruled strongly that
policyholders' interests would not be served by a takeover of BAT
by Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd. or the sale of Los
Angeles-based Farmers to the French company.
   Chief among their objections was Axa-Midi's financing its $4.5
billion offer for Farmers entirely with borrowed funds. Axa-Midi
Chairman Claude Bebear replied that he would find a way to raise
more cash, although he did not say how.
   The regulators also questioned how Goldsmith could finance his
bid for BAT now that the junk-bond market has collapsed. They said
he does not even have a formal proposal on the table for them to
examine.
   Lorraine Johnson, the lead attorney for the Insurance Department
on the matter, suggested that Axa-Midi will have to submit a nearly
new proposal to have a chance of winning approval.
   Goldsmith and Bebear issued statements saying they would push
ahead with attempts to win over Insurance Commissioner Roxani
Gillespie. They noted that California regulators had initially
turned thumbs down on BAT's buyout of Farmers in 1988.
   But Farmers spokesman Jeff Beyer and Insurance Department
officials said the department's objections to that deal were far
less serious than those to the Hoylake-Axa-Midi proposal.
   Bebear had agreed to give Goldsmith $1 billion to help with the
BAT purchase.
   To buy Farmers, Axa-Midi was to borrow $2.25 billion from banks
and $2.25 billion from Goldsmith by giving him promissory notes.
Goldsmith then was to sell the notes for cash.
   ``While Axa-Midi has an outstanding European record, the
leverage of this deal is such that it would endanger the Farmers
group of insurance companies,'' Ms. Gillespie said in a statement
issued by her department.
   The department said Axa-Midi ``basically looked to the financial
performance of the Farmers companies to repay the acquisition debt.
However, insurance companies cannot be relied upon to repay this
type of sizeable debt as it would be dangerous to policyholders and
claimants.''
   Bebear's statement did not say how Axa-Midi intended to put more
cash into the deal. He has suggested in the past that it might do
so by issuing stock, selling non-insurance assets, or restructuring
the deal with Goldsmith.
   Ms. Johnson, senior staff counsel to the Insurance Department,
said the department had ruled that Axa-Midi had failed to meet
three of five test standards and Hoylake had failed four of the
five tests.
   She also said Bebear's earlier suggestions that he could sell
assets or stock to raise cash were too vague.
   ``It's going to have to be more than just, `Trust me _ I'll
provide details later,''' Ms. Johnson said.
   Still another problem is the ``gap'' issue _ the fact that once
Hoylake purchased BAT, Farmers might not be quickly transferred to
Axa-Midi. Under British law, a BAT subsidiary would first have the
legal responsibility to decide independently whether to sell
Farmers, and at what price, Ms. Johnson said.
   Illinois, Idaho, Oregon and Washington have also held hearings
on the proposed takeover. They have yet to announce their
decisions. Hearings began Monday in Texas. Insurance departments in
Arizona, Kansas and Ohio have yet to set hearing dates.

<HEAD>Ames Announces Estimated $228 Million Loss for 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., citing
lower than anticipated sales at the former Zayre stores it bought
in 1988, has announced an estimated net loss of $228 million for
the year ended January 27.
   The discount department store chain also said Monday it was
negotiating with its banks for a new credit agreement.
   The net loss, which is subject to a final audit, includes the
establishment of an after-tax restructuring reserve of
approximately $150 million. Among other things, the reserve will
cover the cost of closing 74 unprofitable stores after a new credit
agreement is reached, the company said.
   The stores are primarily former Zayre stores in Florida,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said Douglas W. Ewing, Ames director of
investor relations.
   ``The operating loss for the year resulted primarily from
substantially lower than anticipated sales and gross margins from
the former Zayre stores,'' Peter Hollis, Ames chief executive
officer, said in a statement. ``The profitability of the original
Ames stores has been maintained. We are dedicated to improving the
performance of the entire company.''
   Ames bought the 392-store Zayre chain on Oct. 28, 1988, for $778
million, doubling its size. It has since closed some of those
stores and converted others to the Ames name.

   Lockheed Corp., looking to cut costs, has
confirmed plans to lay off 500 white-collar employees at its
shrinking Marietta plant.
   The layoffs, which will come by the end of June, will include
staff in engineering, finance and information systems, said Richard
Martin, spokesman for Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.-Georgia.
   By the end of December, Lockheed projects employment at Marietta
of 9,000, down from 20,357 in December 1987.
   Martin said Monday that managers have been asked to look for
budget and manpower cuts to make the company more competitive.
Specific employees have not yet been targeted, he said.
   ``Anytime you let people go, it hurts,'' Martin said. ``But
we've got to be competitive and go out and win business. Otherwise,
there would be a steady stream of people leaving here.''
   One of the company's biggest contracts, for the giant C-5B
military aircraft, ended two years ago. The company has sought to
become a subcontractor for other major aircraft makers.

   Boone Co., an investment company owned by U.S.
takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens, asked Japan's Fair Trade
Commission Tuesday to investigate possible violations of the
Anti-Monopoly Law by Japanese automakers and parts suppliers.
   A commission official, Yoshiro Sekine, said the panel will study
Boone's claims and decide what action to take.
   Pickens has been seeking greater participation in the management
of Koito Manufacturing Co., a Japanese auto parts maker, after
becoming its largest single shareholder in March 1989.
   Sekine said Boone claimed that Japan's 11 automakers put unfair
pressure on parts suppliers to lower the prices of their products.
   He said Boone also claimed that the automakers' close relations
with parts makers limit free competition among the parts suppliers
and hinder entry by outside companies, especially foreign makers,
into the Japanese market.
   Sekine declined to provide further details.
   Koito's second-largest shareholder is Toyota Motor Corp.,
Koito's largest customer.
   Pickens' purchase of the Koito shares has stirred speculation
that he is trying to force the company to buy them back at a
profit, a practice known as greenmail. Pickens has denied the
greenmail accusation.

<TEXT>
   Tribune Broadcasting Co. has agreed to
discontinue its ``USA Tonight'' national newscast and use Cable
News Network in six markets to expand local newscasts under an
agreement with Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   The 10-year agreement, announced Monday by TBS Chairman Ted
Turner and Tribune President James C. Dowdle, also includes joint
production of news, documentary specials and entertainment programs.
   ``We're delighted to bring Turner Broadcasting's worldwide
news-gathering capabilities to the Tribune newscasts and are very
optimistic about the future entertainment program undertakings,''
Dowdle said.
   As part of the agreement, Tribune will discontinue its nightly
newscast, ``USA Tonight,'' and its IDNX news service. Six Tribune
stations will become affiliates of Cable News Network, subscribing
to CNN coverage on a non-exclusive basis.
   Those stations are WPIX in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles, WGN in
Chicago, WGNX in Atlanta, KWGN in Denver and WGNO in New Orleans.
   The stations will use the CNN coverage to expand their evening
newscasts to one hour this summer, Tribune officials said in a
statement. ``USA Tonight'' and IDNX will be discontinued in June,
Dowdle said.
   ``We have worked with Tribune Broadcasting Co. over the years
with very positive results,'' Turner said. ``We are convinced that
the extension of this relationship will result in a significant
programming venture.''
   The two companies will also work together to produce quarterly
news specials and original entertainment programming. Tentative
plans include production of two mini-series per year for broadcast
on Tribune stations, Atlanta television station TBS and in general
syndication.
   The entertainment programs will be distributed worldwide by
Turner Program Services while Tribune Entertainment Co. will handle
advertising sales.

Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop
ultra-high-speed data communications projects.
   The agency, which is the Defense Department's central research
and development branch, is attempting to expand its role in helping
deveop domestic industries involved in critical technologies.
   In exchange, Gazelle will pay DARPA a return similar to that
received by venture capitalists for investments in companies with
important technologies.
   In 12 months, the agency can decide either to take royalties on
sales of the products developed under the agreement or payments
based on the appreciation of Gazelle's stock.
   ``We believe it will help us and other future recipients develop
technology critical to U.S. defense needs and also speed
development of technology vital to U.S. commercial
competitiveness,'' Jerry R. Crowley, Gazelle's president and chief
executive officer, said of the agreement.
   In the past, DARPA has funded several other research and
production projects. However, the agreement with Gazelle is the
first under the agency's newly granted authority to support such
activities by means other than traditional grants and contracts,
according to Gazelle.
   Gazelle produces silicon-compatible integrated circuits based on
gallium arsenide.
   Under the DARPA agreement, Gazelle will design and make gallium
arsenide chips and subsystems operating at 1 gigabit per second and
faster, which will allow computers talk to each other as quickly as
they operate internally, the company said. This capability is vital
for high-resolution graphics, high-definition television, parallel
processing and distributed computing.

   Stock prices moved lower on moderate volume in
early trading today over concern about corporate profits and lower
stock prices overseas.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 2.93 to 2,719.14.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 to 2,
with 345 up, 540 down and 543 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.37 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In Japan, prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted and the
dollar surged against the Japanese yen amid speculation that an
agreement on market intervention by leading currency nations was
falling apart.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average was down 2.54 percent at the
close. On Monday, the Nikkei index gained nearly 4 percent in its
fourth-largest single-day advance.
   At midday in London stock prices also were lower. The market was
hurt by news that California insurance regulators rejected the
proposed sale of the Farmers Group insurance division of BAT
Industries PLC as part of investor Sir James Goldsmith's offer for
BAT.
   But analysts said the main reason the U.S. market was depressed
was due to expectations that first-quarter profit reports over the
next few weeks will be lower.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks in early trading, American
Express was up \ to 27, Philip Morris was up &lsqb; to 42 and IBM was up
&rsqb; to 105~. But other blue chips were down, including General
Motors, down \ to 46&rsqb;, Alcoa, down \ to 62 and Coca Cola, down &lsqb; to
79&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.34 to 187.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index also was down 0.34 at 359.34.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.95 to
2,722.07.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 661 up, 824 down and 509 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 114.97 million shares, against 137.49
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Oilman Roy M. Huffington has agreed to sell his
Houston real estate and extensive Indonesian natural gas interests
to an affiliate of Chinese Petroleum Corp., Taiwan's national oil
and gas company.
   The deal, announced Monday, is estimated to be worth at least
$600 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion or more to the
Houston-based Huffington Corp.
   The agreement includes the equivalent of 11 city blocks in
downtown Houston, 419 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to
Houston's Intercontinental Airport and Huffington's Indonesia
petroleum interests that formed its financial backbone, officials
said.
   Chinese Petroleum Corp., through its 10-year-old Houston-based
affiliate Opicoil America Inc., signed a cash stock purchase
agreement that includes Roy M. Huffington Inc. (Huffco) and The
Abercrombie Co., Huffington's real estate operation, officials said.
   While neither Huffington nor Chinese Petroleum officials
disclosed details of the deal, analysts have valued Huffco's 16.7
percent interest in the Indonesian joint venture alone as high as
$1 billion.
   The 72-year-old oilman, who founded Huffington Corp. in 1958,
announced in November he planned to sell out and step down because
of his age and his desire to sell to a bigger energy firm that
would offer career advancement for the company's employees,
including 137 in Houston.
   Lorne D. Bain, president of Roy M. Huffington Inc., an affiliate
of Huffington Corp., said the sale is subject to a definitive stock
purchase agreement that he expects to be completed within 45 to 60
days.
   Mingson Juang, vice president and general manager of Opicoil
America, said Huffco's Indonesian interests initially attracted the
Taipei, Taiwan-based Chinese Petroleum.
   Formed to explore for oil and gas in East Kalimantan, Indonesia,
the joint venture includes Huffco and affiliates of Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings, Ultramar and Universe Tankships Inc.
   The joint venture has proven reserves of 5.9 trillion cubic feet
of gas and 128 million barrels of oil and condensate in fields it
operates in a production sharing contract with Indonesia, and
expects annual revenue of $830 million.

   Soybean futures prices turned slightly lower but
grain futures remained narrowly mixed this morning on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Weakness in the soybean complex was centered in soybean meal,
which had recently provided support to the market.
   Strength in near-term wheat and corn futures was partly rooted
in new sales of both grains to the Soviet Union.
   The Agriculture Department today announced it had accepted three
bids from private exporters to sell 125,000 metric tons of
government-subsidized wheat to the Soviets.
   The USDA on Monday announced Soviet acquisitions of more than
800,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Corn futures were further supported by the USDA's weekly
export-inspections report, which showed the agency examined more
corn for export last week than the market had anticipated.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.61 a bushel;
corn was { cent lower to { cent higher with May at $2.70 a bushel;
oats were \ cent to { cent lower with May at $1.49\ a bushel;

   The stock market was mixed in light trading
today after the tone was set by a drop in stock prices overseas.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.18 to 2,727.25
as of noon on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing

the light volume.
   ``It's really tough to get a handle on it because there's

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. said Tuesday lower
prices in some key product lines, disappointments in manufacturing
operations and a higher effective tax rate led to a 19.3 percent
decline in its first-quarter profit.
   The Purchase, N.Y.-based paper and forest products maker said it
earned $180 million, or $1.65 a share, in the three months ended
March 31, down from $223 million, or $1.96 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 23.1 percent to $3.2 billion from $2.6 billion.
   John A. Georges, chairman and chief executive, said the results
were affected by lower prices in paper pulps and printed and
writing papers.
   The deepest price cuts came in uncoated printing and writing
papers, he said. ``Recent increases in industry capacity led to
price reductions even though sales volume remained at healthy
levels,'' he said.
   He said paper pulp price declines stemmed from inventory
corrections by customers.
   Manufacturing costs rose at some mills due to higher wood prices
and weather-related conditions, Georges said. Production
interruptions associated with capital projects and process
modifications also affected the performance of the mill systems, he
said.
   ``These situations were temporary, and manufacturing conditions
are returning to normal,'' he said.
   The company's effective tax rate for the quarter rose to 40
percent from 38 percent a year ago, he said.
   Georges said the company's other businesses posted improved
performances, citing contributions to operating income from recent
acquisitions, speciality products businesses and consumer packaging.
   ``While the uncertainty of future economic conditions makes it
difficult to predict performance, we believe that our investments
in new markets, development of additional higher value products and
improved operating efficiencies should provide the basis for
continuing good financial results,'' he said.

   The dollar drifted fractionally lower against most
key currencies in European trading Tuesday afternoon.
   Gold prices fell.
   Late in London's trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.6900
West German marks, down from 1.6923 marks late Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar climbed 1.70 yen to a closing 158.15 yen on
Tuesday. Later, in London, it was quoted at 158.60 yen.
   The dollar held on to most of its overnight gains against the
yen, a reflection of market expectations that the Japanese currency
will remain under pressure without significant action on the
interest rate front, or without clear signals that the Group of
Seven nations are intent on supporting the yen.
   Finance officials from the seven countries met in Paris over the
weekend. The G-7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan,
West Germany and the United States.
   The dollar gained against the British pound which was quoted
late Tuesday at $1.6345, compared with $1.6397 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates late in Europe compared with late Monday's
levels were: 1.4955 Swiss francs, down from 1.4960; 5.6750 French
francs, down from 5.6805; 1.9030 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9043;
1,240.00 Italian lire, down from 1,242.00; and 1.1613 Canadian

   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $375.15 a troy
ounce, down from $375.50 late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $375.25, down from $376.25 late
Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.16 an ounce to close at a bid

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced today that
the government plans to freeze and seize assets in cases involving
alleged savings and loan fraud.
   The announcement came a day after the Bush administration
acknowledged that its $50 billion savings and loan bailout will not
be enough. A congressional report has said costs could be as high
as $500 billion.
   A major problem with S&amp;L investigations, said Justice spokesman
David Runkel, is that ``the assets are not there following the
convictions.'' The new effort will try to ``prevent assets from
being dissipated,'' he said.
   In Dallas, a federal bank fraud task force has brought charges
against 62 people, of whom 49 have been convicted, the department
said.
   The government has recovered about $12.5 million while the
taxpayers have spent ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to cover
the costs of the illegal actions, Runkel said.
   The assets to be targeted could be either those of the S&amp;Ls or
of the individuals involved, and the actions would be
``pre-judgment attachments,'' he said.
   The authority to freeze and seize the assets was part of the S&amp;L
bailout package approved by Congress last year.
   ``It's a device to freeze assets that are derived from savings
and loan wrongdoing,'' Runkel said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met today with Timothy Ryan,
who was sworn in Monday to a five-year term as director of the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision. As a result of
the meeting, Thornburgh directed his staff and U.S. attorneys to
meet with Ryan's people to coordinate efforts.
   ``I want to send a message to the public: we will not tolerate
the fraudulent practices and decisions in the industry that in the
past have led to so many failures and put such a financial burden
on the American taxpayer,'' Ryan told top officials at his agency.
   ``There's no question that the cost is increasing and we'll have
to take that into account in deciding future actions,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   Fitzwater was responding to a report by the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, that the cost of the
president's bailout program would be $325 billion instead of the
$257 billion estimated only five months earlier.
   Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who directs the GAO,
said the cost could easily surpass $400 billion and could hit $500
billion if the economy falters. The estimates include the
government's borrowing expenses over 40 years.
   Previously, Treasury Department officials had said only that a
shortfall was possible. Private analysts have said for months that
the $50 billion program enacted last year was inadequate.
   ``We don't have an analysis either to endorse or reject the GAO
numbers, except to say there clearly is going to be additional
costs,'' Fitzwater said. ``Those numbers will have to be decided
upon at some point.
   ``At this time, there is not enough information to make a
reliable estimate of how much more may be required,'' he said.
   Ryan, 44, was confirmed last Wednesday by the Senate on a 62-37
vote. Democratic opponents complained that the former Labor
Department solicitor had no direct experience in banking.
   Ryan succeeds Salvatore R. Martoche, an assistant treasury
secretary who served one month as acting director of the thrift
office after the resignation of M. Danny Wall. Wall quit under
congressional criticism for his handling of the failure of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, based in Irvine, Calif.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Eastern Europe Development Bank</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting for all needing.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-two nations have agreed on the terms of a
development bank for Eastern Europe after reaching a compromise
over the role of the Soviet Union.
   Under the compromise, the Soviet Union will become a
full-fledged member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development but has agreed to limit its borrowing for the first
three years.
   The official signing of an accord to create the bank will take
place May 30 in Paris, said Jacques Attali, advisor to French
President Francois Mitterrand. The location of the bank
headquarters and its first president will be disclosed then, he
said.
   Attali's announcement followed meetings Sunday and Monday of
representatives of the 42 countries planning to contribute to the
bank's capital base. Plans call for the bank to have a capital base
of 10 billion European Currency Units, the equivalent of about $12
billion.
   The United States would contribute 10 percent of the bank's
capital, while the European Community would be responsible for 3
percent. France, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Italy and Japan
each will contribute 8.5 percent, with the rest spread out among
the other members. EC countries collectively will account for 51
percent of the capital contribution.
   The Soviet Union will contribute 6 percent of the bank's
capital, he said.
   The representatives agreed on 58 articles of the bank's
statutes, including the type of currency to be used in the bank and
the amount and form of capital contributions of each member, Attali
said.
   For the first three years, the Soviet Union will only be
eligible for loans totalling the amount of paid-in capital it
contributes each year, Attali said. After that period, the
restrictions can be removed with the approval of 85 percent of the
member countries, he said.
   The delegates agreed that the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and
European Currency Unit all can be used to contribute capital to the
bank.
   At the first session to set terms for the bank, in January, the
United States objected to full participation by the Soviet Union
unless Moscow initiated major market reforms.
   In addition to the United States and virtually every European
country, participants in the bank include Japan, Morocco, Israel,
Egypt and South Korea.

<HEAD>Reader's Digest Association Plans French Family Budget Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reader's Digest Association Inc. said Tuesday
that its French subsidiary plans to launch a monthly magazine in
October that will be designed to help families manage their
finances.
   It would be the first family finance magazine from the publisher
of Reader's Digest and the first magazine startup for the company
since its stock was made available to the public for the first time
in mid-February.
   Reader's Digest Association said the new magazine will be called
Budgets Famille, or Family Budgets, and will contain news, feature
articles and tips on topics ranging from savings and borrowing
strategies to the best ways families can budget for their
children's education and vacations.
   The company, which is based in Pleasantville, N.Y., has been
publishing a French language edition of Reader's Digest since 1947
and that magazine, called Selection, has a circulation of 1.1
million a month.
   ``We've designed our new magazine to be of service to readers _
in the same tradition as Reader's Digest,'' Henri Capdeville,
managing director of Reader's Digest France, was quoted in a news
release.
   He said while there are other magazines published in France that
focus on personal finances and investments, none cover the combined
topics of families and money.
   The magazine's target audience will be upper- and middle-income
readers between 30 and 45 years old.
   Bruce Trachtenberg, a spokesman for Reader's Digest in
Pleasantville, said the parent company intends to ``see how well it
performs in France'' before deciding whether to publish versions of
the new French magazine in other languages and other countries.
   But he noted that the company said when describing its business
plans at the time that some institutional investors offered some of
their non-voting stock for sale to the public on Feb. 15 that it
was interested in global expansion of its specialty magazine
publishing operations through startups and acquisitions.
   ``We are looking for opportunities to share concepts around the
world,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   In addition to Reader's Digest, a monthly compendium of
condensed stories that is published in 15 languages in 39
countries, Reader's Digest Association publishes The Family
Handyman, Travel Holiday and New Choices for the Best Years. It
recently agreed to buy American Health magazine.

   Stocks finished lower Tuesday in lackluster
dealings, as Tokyo's overnight drop and some disturbing corporate
news sent the market downhill.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
10.2 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2217.5. The narrower Financial
Times 30-share index shed 9.8 points, or 0.57 percent, closing at
1732.5.
   The 500-stock index was down 6.51, or 0.54 percent, at 1196.87.
   Volume was a slight 367.6 million shares, a touch higher than
turnover of 304.6 million a day earlier.
   Dealers said they expect the lean volume that has characterized
the market ahead of Easter to continue through the rest of the week.
   BAT Industries PLC, the financial services and tobacco
conglomerate, fell 15 pence (25 cents) to 740 pence ($12.06) a
share, after insurance regulators in California dealt a blow to Sir
James Goldsmith's bid for the diversified U.K. conglomerate.
   BAT owns Farmers Group Inc. Goldsmith, the Anglo-French takeover
specialist, had proposed to sell Farmers to Axa-Midi Assurances of
France upon acquiring BAT.
   On Monday, California regulators ruled that policyholders'
interests would not be served by a takeover of BAT by Goldsmith's
Hoylake Investments Ltd. or the sale of Los Angeles-based Farmers
to the French company.

   Two members of the Mitsubishi Group created from
the break-up of Mitsubishi Mining during the U.S. occupation after
World War II announced Tuesday that they will merge.
   Mitsubishi Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement Co., in
announcing their merger, attempted to head off expected criticism
that the move is a step toward re-establishment of the monopoly
power held by Japan's pre-war ``zaibatsu'' financial combines.
   The Mitsubishi Group companies comprised one of the three most
powerful zaibatsu before and during World War II.
   Under the merger plan, nine shares of Mitsubishi Metal will
equal 10 shares of Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement effective Dec. 1, the
companies said.
   The merger will link one of Japan's largest smelters of
nonferrous metals with one of its largest producers of cement.
   ``Every president of the two companies over the past 40 years
sought out the possibility of a merger,'' said Mitsubishi Metal
President Takeshi Nagano, who will become chairman of the new
company.
   ``When this merger is complete, we will feel that the war is
finally over for our companies,'' Nagano said at a news conference
jointly sponsored by the two firms.
   The presidents of the two companies said the merger should not
be seen as a ``monopolistic threat.''
   By combining resources, the two firms will be able to grow into
a comprehensive company, which is ``the best way to conduct a
flexible and dynamic adjustment to various structural changes
progressing worldwide,'' Nagano said.
   Masaya Fujimaru, president of Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement, who
will be president of the new company, said the merger is not aimed
at strengthening the business affiliations of the Mitsubishi Group,
which is still known for its strong ties among member companies.
   Nagano said the metal business is vulnerable to changes in
foreign exchange rates and market prices, and the merger would help
protect against such vulnerability.
   In addition, the companies said the combination of research in
metals and ceramics is expected to create a wide range of new
materials.
   The sales of the new company are expected to total the
equivalent of about $5.7 billion during the first year and $6.4
billion within the first five years, the two companies said. The
new company, which will have 9,000 employees, will have total
assets of $5.1 billion, they said.
   The companies decided on the merger in early March, right before
Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement closed its last coal mine in Ohyubari,
marking the end of the company's 120-year coal mining business.

   Federal safety officials today concluded that
failures by the airline, the manufacturer and the government all
contributed to the loss of a cargo door on United Flight 811 over
the Pacific Ocean last year. Nine passengers were blown out of the
aircraft to their deaths.
   The National Transportation Safety Board voted 3-0 to blame
United Airlines, Boeing, and the Federal Aviation Administration in
the Feb. 24, 1989, accident, which has already led to FAA action to
ensure that Boeing 747 cargo doors are secure.
   The board said United failed to properly inspect the door of the
airliner after its electrical system failed in December 1988 and
mechanics had to operate it manually. It had been operating
electrically since then, however.
   Boeing and the FAA were cited for failing to order timely
corrective measures after another cargo door malfunctioned on a
1987 Pan American flight from London to New York. The board noted,
however, that the FAA has since issued directives for improving the
doors and plans additional action.
   United spokesman Robert Dowdy said the airline has complied with
all FAA requirements except one that resulted from a clerical
error. Six words mandating an inspection were left out of a
regulation when it was copied from FAA documents into the company
system, investigators said.
   Dowdy said the board conducted a good investigation with the
evidence it had but said recovery of the cargo door itself is
needed to make it more-thorough. Boeing had recommended that the
board conclude that probable cause of the incident could not be
determined.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the company had no
comment on the NTSB finding ``except to say we feel, No. 1, those
cargo doors are safe.''
   ``There were subsequent changes made as a result of the
accident, changes and inspection processes. All of the necessary
actions have been taken to ensure integrity of that door's
operation in flight,'' Gamble said.
   The FAA is expected to issue a new order requiring an additional
warning system in Boeing-747 cargo doors to indicate to the pilot
and the ground crew that the doors are properly locked,
investigators told the board.
   The board said there is evidence that the current system can
indicate that the door is locked when it is not.
   The plane returned to Honolulu from a scheduled flight to New
Zealand after the door popped off at about 22,000 feet, ripping off
a 15-by-10-foot section of the fuselage and hurling a group of
passengers and their seats out of the aircraft.
   Five other passengers were seriously hurt and 33 received minor
injuries. The plane carried a crew of 18 and 337 passengers.
   Ron Schleed, investigator in charge for the accident, said
efforts to locate and recover the cargo door from three miles below
the ocean would continue despite the fact the board has completed
its report. He said a Navy vessel and sophisticated probe device
would be available in June to search for the door.
   Investigators hope to determine exactly what failure in the
mechanism may have caused the door to fly off, although they
believe it was caused by damage to devices either during manual
opening and closing of the door or due to a electrical malfunction.

   Microsoft's industry-standard MS-DOS
computer software can now say it in Cyrillic.
   Microsoft introduced a Russian-language version of its MS-DOS
operating system Monday. MS-DOS is the standard base layer of
software for IBM personal computers and compatible models and is
installed on more than 40 million computers worldwide.
   The system now comes in 13 languages.
   ``The new Russian-language version further underscores our
commitment to the international marketplace, which is now
responsible for 53 percent of our revenues,'' said Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman.
   The Russian version uses Cyrillic characters on-screen and also
runs printers with Cyrillic typefaces.
   The translation is the first in Russian by Microsoft. It was
done with the help of Dialogue, a Soviet-American computer joint
venture formed in 1988.
   An operating system is the base layer of software that controls
such computer functions as operating the keyboard and opening
files. It differs from applications programs, which provide such
specific uses as word processing or spreadsheets.
   ``The standardization of Soviet computer science on the
worldwide DOS standard opens the door for our users to the largest
application base in the world,'' said Priotr Zvelov, the Soviet
chairman of Dialogue. ``It also allows our developers to build
applications for a worldwide market.''

<HEAD>Review of Union Carbide Settlement Adjourned Until July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court review of the
government's $470 million settlement with Union Carbide Corp. for
the 1984 Bohpal gas disaster was adjourned Tuesday until July, a
news agency said.
   The current government and attorneys for victims' groups say the
settlement, agreed to by a previous government, is inadequate.
Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide says the deal is fair and
binding.
   The Supreme Court ordered the settlement in February 1989 during
arguments on interim relief for victims, pending a decision the
outcome of a $3 billion lawsuit for damages against Union Carbide.
   The government of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi sued after
passing a law making it the victims' sole representative. It said
the leakage of toxic gas from a pesticide plant operated by Union
Carbide was caused by negligence. Union Carbide maintains the
leakage was caused by sabotage.
   At least 3,598 people in the central Indian city of Bhopal died
after inhaling the gas and another 20,000 were injured.
   Arguments on whether to overturn the settlement, which was
endorsed by the Gandhi government, began April 5. Press Trust of
India reported that a five-judge panel hearing arguments in the
case will reconvene July 17.

   Corn futures prices closed moderately higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting increased export
sales. Soybean futures retreated and wheat finished mixed.
   The gain in corn marked the eighth daily increase in the last
nine trading sessions.
   Some of the buying was a reaction to Agriculture Department
announcements of U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaling more
than 1.5 million metric tons since Friday.
   Tuesday's trading also featured the return of large-scale buying
by commercial grain dealers, who have been absent from the market
in recent days.
   ``This indicates the commercials are pricing these purchases and
that there may be some more announcements coming out,'' said Susan
Leighty, grains analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Strength in the wheat reflected spillover buying from corn, she
said. Soybeans traded lower in line with weaker soybean meal.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.62 a bushel; corn was
1\ cents to 3 cents higher with May at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were 1

<HEAD>Goldsmith Group Says Takeover Bid to Continue Despite California
Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attempted hostile takeover of BAT Industries
PLC by a Sir James Goldsmith-led investor group will continue
despite a potentialy devastating setback from California insurance
regulators, a spokesman for the group said Tuesday.
   ``We are reviewing the judgment but these insurance hearings are
going on in nine states and we will continue our efforts in all the
regulatory hearings,'' said David Beck, spokesman for Hoylake
Investments Ltd.
   California state insurance regulators on Monday rejected a
proposed acquisition of BAT's Farmers insurance companies by
France's Axa-Midi Assurances.
   The sale of Farmers Group Inc. to Axa-Midi Assurances is a key
element of Hoylake's strategy in its proposed $21 billion takeover
of BAT, Britain's largest conglomerate.
   One objection by the California insurance regulators was
Axa-Midi's financing of its $4.5 billion offer for Farmers entirely
with borrowed funds. Axa-Midi has stated it would raise cash but
has not yet indicated how.
   Beck said Hoylake was not surprised by the insurance
commissioner's ruling.
   ``When BAT acquired Farmers they were rejected by California
initially, and rejected several times in several different
states,'' Beck said. ``It doesn't come wholly as a surprise.''
   BAT acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion following a
protracted takeover battle that also saw challenges to the deal by
a number of state insurance regulators.
   BAT issued a statement Tuesday that it was not surprised by the
ruling.
   ``California has long opposed highly leveraged acquisitions of
its insurance companies and no doubt the other eight states will
reach similar conclusions,'' the statement read.
   Illinois, Idaho, Oregon and Washington also have held hearings
on the proposed takeover. They have yet to announce their decisions.
   Hearings began Monday in Texas. Insurance departments in
Arizona, Kansas and Ohio have yet to set hearing dates.
   BAT has launched a defensive strategy against the hostile bid
which includes selling its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field
stores. After restructuring, the company has said, BAT intends to
focus on its remaining tobacco and financial services business.
   BAT Chairman Pat Sheehy issued a statement which said the
company looked forward ``to being able to manage our business, of
which Farmers is a key strategic element, without further
distractions.''
   The Hoylake takeover bid was announced in July by the powerful
investor group led by Goldsmith, British investment banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer.
   The acquisition would be the biggest British takeover and rival
the record $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts and Co. in 1989 as the biggest anywhere.
   Hoylake has said it intends to break up the London-based BAT,
which has interests in tobacco, financial services, retailing and
paper, to better realize the value of the separate businesses.

<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., the maker of Converse footwear
and Broyhill furniture, on Tuesday reported a $23.3 million
fourth-quarter loss and a 50 percent drop in profits for the year.
   The poor financial results come as the company struggles to
restructure and pay off large debt assumed to fend off a hostile
takeover in 1988 by Steven and Richard Rales of Washington.
   Sales from continued operations for the quarter, which ended
Feb. 24, were $380 million, down 21 percent from $483 million the
same period a year ago.
   For its fiscal year, sales were $1.65 billion, down 17 percent
from the previous year when sales were $2.01 billion.
   The $23.3 million quarterly loss compares with a $5.9 million
loss for the same period a year earlier. The previous loss would
have been much higher if not for the one-time, $33.9 million gain
from the sale of some of the company's divisions.
   Since the takeover attempt, Interco has sold Ethan Allen Inc.,
Londontown Corp., Senack Shoes Inc., Central Hardware Co. and Big
Yank Corp.-Cowden Manufacuring Co. to raise money to pay off $2.9
billion in debt.
   Interco now consists of the furniture and home furnishing
manufacturers Broyhill and Lane, and the footwear makers Converse
and Florsheim.

<HEAD>GAO Says Board of Trade, CFTC Followed Rules in Soybean
Liquidation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade acted within ethics
rules when it declared an emergency and ordered traders to reduce
July 1989 soybean holdings, congressional investigators said
Tuesday.
   The General Accounting Office was asked to probe last summer's
order to liquidate large stakes in the July futures contract. The
controversy centered on Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., one of the
world's largest soybean processors.
   Ferruzzi had gained a huge stake in the soybean contract and
traders believed the company's position could lead to price
manipulation.
   The Board of Trade was widely criticized by farmers who saw the
value of soybeans drop. They suggested that traders may have
learned secretly about the emergency order before it was publicly
announced July 11.
   But the GAO concluded that Board of Trade members who held
contracts did not participate in meetings that led to the emergency
order.
   The Board of Trade and the government's Commodity Futures
Trading Commission ``followed their policies and procedures
concerning emergency actions,'' the GAO said.
   ``Our review ... confirmed that the data supported CFTC's
conclusion that the (Board of Trade) was in compliance with CFTC
requirements,'' investigators said.
   Between May 25 and July 11, the CFTC asked Ferruzzi at least 10
times to voluntarily reduce its large position in July soybean
futures. The Board of Trade made the same request at least six
times.
   Ferruzzi refused to honor the requests, and on July 11 the Board
of Trade told members with more than 3 million July bushels to
reduce those holdings to less than 1 million.
   In November, the American Agriculture Movement filed a lawsuit
against the Board of Trade, alleging that the emergency order
illegally manipulated soybean prices.
   Board of Trade Chairman Karsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann called the
lawsuit, which seeks more than $100 million in damages for farmers,
frivolous.

<HEAD>UAL, Unions Sign Definitive Buyout Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. said Tuesday it had formalized its
agreement to sell the company, the parent of United Airlines, to
its employees for about $4.38 billion.
   The definitive merger agreement follows the signing Friday of an
agreement in principle between Chicago-based UAL and its employee
unions representing United's pilots, machinists and flight
attendants.
   The formalization of the buyout pact sets into motion the
process for leaders of the three unions to seek rank-and-file
approval of wage cuts and other contract concessions designed to
save $2 billion over five years as a contribution toward the buyout.
   The wage cuts range from 5 percent for flight attendants with
less than five years of seniority to 11 percent for pilots with
more than five years.
   Under the agreement, UAL's 71,000 employees will buy 100 percent
of the company by exchanging for each share of UAL stock $155 in
cash, $35 in UAL notes and one share in Covia Corp. valued at $11.
   Covia is a computerized reservations company in which UAL holds
a 50 percent interest.
   The deal, valued at $201 a share, could take up to eight months
to complete. The agreement gives the employees four months to
secure financing and another four months to complete the deal.
   Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the union group, said he
envisioned ratification of the contracts within ``a month or two at
the extreme.''
   Leaders of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association
planned to hold an informational meeting Wednesday for Chicago-area
pilots, then take the show on the road to United pilots in other
cities, according to a recorded message on the union's information
hotline.
   UAL's stock traded in a narrow range Tuesday, closing up 25
cents at $161.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William G. McGowan, chairman of MCI
Communications Corp., was in fair condition Tuesday at
Presbyterian-University Hospital after undergoing exploratory chest
surgery, the company and hospital said.
   Doctors decided last week to operate after ``they discovered a
condition'' during a routine checkup, said MCI spokeswoman Kathleen
Keegan.
   She declined to describe the condition.
   Washington-based MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance
telephone company, earlier issued a brief statement that Dr.
Bartley Griffith suggested the exploratory surgery following a
periodic exam and performed the surgery.
   In the statement, Griffith said the surgery was ``completely
unrelated'' to McGowan's 1987 heart transplant but did not
elaborate.
   McGowan, 62, has had regular checkups since the April 1987
transplant, Ms. Keegan said. The transplant came four months after
McGowan suffered a heart attack.
   McGowan was admitted to the hospital Monday and is expected to
go home to Washington in five to seven days, Ms. Keegan said.
   McGowan rested in his room with his wife, Sue Ginn, following
the operation at about 1:15 p.m., hospital spokesman Mark Kanny
said.
   MCI, second in size to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., on
Monday announced it had agreed to acquire Telecom USA Inc., the
nation's fourth-largest long-distance company, for $1.25 billion.

   Stock prices ended mixed in moderate, quiet
trading Tuesday after overcoming earlier losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.01 to 2,731.08.
   Declining issues barely nudged out advancing ones in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 723 up, 740
down and 511 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.02 million
shares, up from 114.97 million in Monday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 163.85 million shares.
   Volume was limited by the Passover holiday, which began Tuesday,
and by the upcoming Good Friday holiday this week, traders said.
   Jack Baker, head of equity trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said there were few factors affecting trading other than the
light volume.
   ``It's really tough to get a handle on it because there's
nothing to talk about,'' he said.
   He added that the market was awaiting the outcome of an auction
Tuesday of $3.5 billion in 40-year bonds by the government's
Resolution Funding Corp., which funds the bailout of troubled
savings and loans.
   The results were not announced until after the market closed,
and they could be bad news for the market Wednesday. Kevin
Flanagan, a money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said the results ``definitely came in weaker than expected.''
   Wall Street had been looking for the bonds to sell at an average
yield of 8.85 to 8.86 percent, Flanagan said. In fact, they sold at
8.89 percent, substantially higher, indicating investors offered
less for the bonds than expected.
   Stock prices had opened slightly lower on the heels of losses
overseas and due to continued concern that first-quarter corporate
profit reports over the next few weeks will be lower.
   In Japan, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average was down 2.54
percent at the close. On Monday, the Nikkei index gained nearly 4
percent in its fourth-largest single-day advance.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed down 0.46 percent.
   Among most-active U.S. blue chips, American Express was up | to
27&rsqb;, Philip Morris was up &rsqb; to 42\, Exxon was unchanged at 46 and
USX was down } to 34|.
   Ames Department Stores was the most-active NYSE issue, dropping
~ to 2&rsqb;. The discount store operator announced it expects to report
a loss of $288 million for its fiscal 1989 and that it was
negotiating a new credit agreement with its banks.
   Telecom USA, the second-most-active NYSE issue, fell &lsqb; to 38.
MCI Communications announced Monday it would buy the regional
long-distance phone company for $1.25 billion. MCI was the
second-most-active issue on the over-the-counter market, gaining }
to 36{.
   Motorola, another active NYSE issue, shot up 4\ to 68{. The
technology company reported first-quarter profit rose 3.2 percent,
at the high end of analysts' expectations. It also said there are
signs of renewed strength in the semiconductor industry.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market grew $4.912 billion, or 0.15
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.28 to 187.63.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.67 to 397.76, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.70 to 342.07.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose

<TEXT>
   Bell of Pennsylvania has agreed to pay
$42 million to settle charges in two 1988 lawsuits that it used
deceptive marketing techniques in selling optional services, state
officials said Tuesday.
   The settlement could mean refunds of up to $63 each for more
than 1 million customers, State Consumer Advocate David Barasch
said.
   More than $35 million in refunds would go to 1.5 million
residential customers who signed up for Bell's so-called ``custom
calling'' services between Jan. 1, 1985, and March 31, 1988.
   Bell of Pennsylvania admitted to no wrongdoing in settling the
suit, Bill Harral, Bell vice president of external affairs, said
Tuesday. He said any allegedly deceptive sales techniques were
eliminated when the suits were filed. The proposal would settle
lawsuits before the state Public Utility Commission and in
Commonwealth Court. The PUC must approve settlement of the consumer
advocate's action.
   Customers who signed up for call waiting, call forwarding,
three-way calling, speed calling and touch-tone service between
1985 and 1988 would receive a $12 credit on their bill for each
service they ordered. People who no longer are Bell customers would
get a check.
   The allegations were based on an investigation in which 32 test
calls were made to Bell representatives by agents posing as
customers.

<HEAD>Victims Group Hails Ruling Making Insurers Liable for $960 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruling that insurance
companies are liable for up to $960 million in damages for asbestos
exposure could clear the way for settlement of thousands of claims,
a victims' advocate said Tuesday.
   The five insurance companies reacted with caution to the ruling
by a New Jersey superior court judge, which involved claims
stemming from asbestos products made by Owens-Illinois Corp. from
1948 to 1958.
   Heather Maurer, executive director of the Asbestos Victims of
America in Soquel, Calif., which represents more than 8,000 people,
the decision is a key step to resolving lawsuits filed against
asbestos manufacturers.
   ``This basically means that our asbestos victims now have
recourse and the manufacturers no longer will be able to say, `We
don't have any money to pay you because our insurance companies
won't pay us,''' she said.
   Andrew Berry, an attorney for Owens-Illinois of Toledo, Ohio,
said the ruling last Friday was the largest of its kind involving
claims against an asbestos manufacturer.
   Owens-Illinois had sought a ruling to determine whether its five
insurance companies would be liable to cover damage awards. The
insurers claimed that asbestos-related lawsuits were excluded from
policies written between 1977 and 1985.
   Asbestos is widely used in building materials and as a
sound-proofing and fire-proofing agent. It has been linked to
health problems and deaths caused by tiny particles that become
trapped in the lungs.
   Allstate Insurance Co., one of the five companies involved in
the decision, said in a statement Tuesday it was ``surprised and
disappointed with the ruling.''
   Allstate, based in Northbrook, Ill., said its exposure to claims
would not exceed $25 million and thus would not threaten the health
of the company.
   General Reinsurance Co., a Stamford, Conn.-based firm that
assumed much of the insurance exposure of Owens Insurance Ltd., an
Owen-Illinois subsidiary, said the asbestos claims would not impact
its earnings or financial condition.
   Both companies said the decision would be reviewed to whether to
appeal.
   Owens-Illinois claimed in the 5-year-old lawsuit insurers
wrongfully refused to honor claims. The judge rejected insurers'
arguments that the Owens-Illinois policies did not cover asbestos
damage, Berry said.
   Most of the 75,000 suits against Owens-Illinois involved
individuals and companies claiming injuries and damages stemming
from the use of an insulation product manufactured by
Owens-Illinois, he said.
   Included were claims of asbestosis and other forms of lung
cancer linked to asbestos exposure.
   Asbestos exposure also has been linked to cancers of the
esophagus and colon, and to mesothelioma, an always-fatal cancer of
the lining of lungs or abdominal cavities.
   United Insurance Co. and CIGNA Reinsurance Co., the two other
insurance companies involved in the case, did not have an immediate
comment to the decision. Owens-Illinois spokesman Jeff Hoff also
declined comment.
   New Jersey has been the focus of much of the court action over
asbestos exposure, partly because it was the home of the
Johns-Manville Corp., formerly of Manville, N.J.
   Now known as Manville Corp. of Denver, the asbestos maker filed
for bankruptcy protection in 1982 after a number of injury and
wrongful death claims.
   The company eventually settled the claims by contributing $600
million to several trust funds meant to compensate those made ill
by Manville products.

   The state-owned shipyard where workers
founded the Solidarity labor movement will be transferred to
private ownership by selling shares to employees and the public,
its manager announced Tuesday.
   The fate of the shipyard in the northern port of Gdansk had been
uncertain since October 1988, when Poland's then-Communist
government announced plans to close it. Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa viewed the step as a political move, but authorities said
the shipyard was unprofitable and must be closed as part of
economic reforms.
   ``Poland should finally understand that we were fighting for
everybody, but we got nothing out of it,'' Walesa told workers
Tuesday at a Gdansk Shipyard rally where the ownership transfer was
announced. ``The time of struggle is over. ... Now we are fighting
for ourselves.''
   The manager of the shipyard, Hans Szyt, read a telegram from
Industry Minister Tadeusz Syryjczyk announcing the decision during
the rally by 2,000 workers protesting the slow pace of government
decisions on the shipyard's fate.
   The shares will be sold to the public for $1.05 each, with the
founding capital to total about $11.4 million, said Andrzej
Popczyk, director of the Industry Ministry's legal department.
   Shipyard workers will be able to purchase 20 percent of the
shares at half the offering price before the end of 1990 and at
half the market price after that, Popczyk said.
   The Solidarity-led government and parliament are working out
complex reforms allowing the sale of state enterprises as part of a
radical switch from a centrally planned socialist economy to a
market-driven system.
   The state industries, although largely unprofitable and
outmoded, make up much of Poland's national wealth, and there has
been widespread concern about how and at what price they will be
sold to private investors.
   Few other details of the plan for the Gdansk shipyard were
offered immediately, including the number of shares to be issued
and the timetable for the sale.
   When the Communists were ousted and the Solidarity-led
government took over last fall, discussions began on how to save
the highly symbolic shipyard.
   One much-publicized offer, from the Polish-born American heiress
Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, seemed to fall through when terms could
not be reached, apparently because the workers were unwilling to
accept the pay and no-strike agreements she required. She has
offered further negotiations.
   The Solidarity movement was born at the shipyard when Walesa, an
electrician fired for union work, scaled a fence to lead a strike
in 1980. As the movement swept Poland, Communist authorities were
forced to recognize Solidarity as the first legal independent trade
union in the Soviet bloc.
   On Dec. 13, 1981, martial law was imposed to repress
Solidarity's surging power. But beset by a staggering economy and
dispirited populace, the Communist regime was forced to turn to
Solidarity for help and relegalized the group in late 1988.
   Within a year, the Communists were trounced in largely
democratic elections, and the first non-Communist government in the
East bloc was installed with a Solidarity veteran as prime minister.

<TEXT>
   AST Research Inc., a small U.S. computer
maker, is invading Japan with a clone of that country's most
popular personal computer, a rare attack on a market dominated by
domestic machines.
   The AST computer to be unveiled Wednesday in Tokyo runs programs
designed for NEC Corp.'s PC-9801, but can be switched over to the
different operating system used by IBM Corp. It will be the first
PC in Japan to run both systems, and AST says it will be priced
competitively with NEC computers.
   NEC has some 70 percent of the Japanese personal computer
market, analysts estimate.
   AST, a decade-old Irvine-based company, had $457 million in
sales last year and also aggressively has been courting business in
the Soviet Union and Eastern European companies.
   Japan's market is already well-established, and is the
second-biggest market for PCs in the world, behind the United
States.
   The introduction of a U.S. product tailored specifically for
Japanese buyers will provide a test trade case for the Japanese,
who say they would buy U.S. products if only Americans would tailor
them to Japanese buying habits.
   ``I think this will really test the Japanese willingness and see
if they will follow through,'' AST President Safi Qureshey said in
a telephone interview. ``This machine is Japanese (compatible) ...
but it is also more than what they can buy today in Japan.''
   He also said: ``The Japanese cannot say that the product is
missing features. It counters the arguments that American companies
are lazy, just comfortable with the U.S. market.''
   But some U.S. observers believe AST's machine will be unable to
make many inroads into NEC's dominion.
   Tim Bajarin of the Santa Clara-based Creative Strategies
International computer consulting firm, noted that IBM already is
selling PCs in Japan and Apple also is selling products there,
particularly desktop publishing setups.
   ``The fact that this particular box is pretty innovative and
priced competitively means it will get some attention,'' he said.
``But NEC is such a powerhouse I can't imagine they will do much
damage there. If anything, they (AST) will take share away from
IBM.''
   But Qureshey said competition from Apple, Compaq, AST and the
hosts of other manufacturers have chewed away pieces of IBM's
business.
   ``NEC is so dominant that a small percentage of their share
means a lot to a small entrant,'' he said.
   He suggested instead that another NEC imitation already
introduced in Japan by Seiko Epson Corp. may be the loser in the
battle.
   ``We're actually the third in the market,'' Qureshey said. ``But
we're the only ones compatible with both Japanese and American
machines.''
   A basic NEC computer, with no hard disk and no monitor, costs
about 390,000 yen, or the equivalent of $2,475, AST spokesman Joel
Don said. Seiko Epson's PC costs 328,000 yen, or about $2,080,
according to AST spokesman Joel Don.
   ``Our machine will be in between NEC and Epson in terms of
competitive pricing,'' Don said.
   AST teamed with Japan's Kawasaki Steel Corp. and Tomcat Computer
Corp. to develop its new computer, named the Dual SX-16. The
machines will be sold under the brand names of Japanese
distributors. AST is negotiating with several potential
distributors, including Sharp Corp., Don said.
   The company plans to build the first machines at its Fountain
Valley plant in Southern California but probably will shift
production to Taiwan when distribution arrangements are completed,
he said.

   The Justice Department on Tuesday
removed the final obstacle to Norton Co.'s planned $550 million
sale of Eastman Christenson Co. to Baker Hughes Inc.
   To allow the sale to move forward, officials required Baker
Hughes, a Houston-based energy products and services company, to
sell the diamond drill bit business of the Hughes Tool Co.
   Eastman Christenson also makes diamond drill bits, and the sale
by Baker Hughes would eliminate possible antitrust problems
surrounding the deal.
   Baker Hughes corporate vice president Ron Turner said the
company sold $17 million in drill bits last year. He said several
parties have expressed interest in buying the line but he declined
to name the potential buyers.
   Eastman Christenson drills contributed $40 million to the
company's 1989 sales, Turner said.
   The companies said they expected to close the deal within the
next few days.
   The Justice Department's consent decree stipulates that if the
drill business is not sold by Aug. 6, it must be placed under the
oversight of a trustee to manage and sell the company for Baker
Hughes.
   Norton Co., a leading maker of abrasives such as grinding tools
and sandpaper, is a target of a $1.6 billion, $75 per share hostile
takeover bid from the British conglomerate BTR PLC.
   The Norton board of directors has rejected the offer, but BTR
has threatened to take control of the board via a proxy fight at
the company's upcoming annual meeting.

   Roy Huffington, a Harvard-educated geologist who
struck it rich in Indonesia, has agreed to sell his interests in
natural gas and Houston real estate to Taiwan's national oil
company.
   Terms weren't disclosed when the deal was announced Monday, but
analysts have valued Huffington Corp.'s assets at anywhere from
$600 million to $1 billion or more.
   The properties include the equivalent of 11 city blocks in
downtown Houston, 419 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to
Houston's Intercontinental Airport and Indonesian natural gas and
oil interests that formed the backbone of Huffington's empire.
   Chinese Petroleum Corp.'s Houston-based affiliate, Opicoil
America Inc., signed a cash stock purchase agreement that includes
Roy M. Huffington Inc. (Huffco) and The Abercrombie Co.,
Huffington's real estate operation, officials said.
   Huffington, 72, became an international oilman because he
thought there were too many restrictions on natural-gas production
in the United States. He began searching in Indonesia because its
deltas were similar to those of southern Louisiana, a proven
gas-rich area.
   In 1968, Huffington and a partner signed a drilling contract
with Indonesia's state oil and gas company. The venture began
paying off in 1972, when Huffington's company found a major gas
reserve.
   The field in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, has proven reserves of
5.9 trillion cubic feet of gas and 128 million barrels of oil and
condensate. The field, which Huffington operates in a
production-sharing contract with Indonesia, expects annual revenues
of $830 million.
   In the late 1970s, Huffington began diversifying into real
estate.
   Huffington graduated from Southern Methodist University with a
geology degree in 1938, then earned master's and doctoral degrees
at Harvard.
   He started as a field geologist for Humble Oil &amp; Refining
Company in 1946 and a decade later founded his own firm, Roy M.
Huffington, Inc.
   Huffington's personal fortune has been valued at more than $350
million by Forbes magazine.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures tumbled to their lowest levels in more than a
year Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid selling
inspired by continuing signs of a worldwide glut.
   On other commodity markets, cocoa futures surged to their
highest close in nearly a year; precious metals fell; grains and
soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures rose.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 19 cents to 76
cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $17.68 a
barrel, the lowest settlement of a near-month crude oil contract
since Feb. 14, 1989.
   Heating oil futures finished .10 cent to .88 cent lower with May
at 52.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.35 cents to 2.46
cents lower with May at 58.43 cents a gallon.
   As in the five previous sessions, selling was largely motivated
by perceptions of oversupply due to seasonal refinery shutdowns and
OPEC overproduction of crude oil.
   ``There's a lot of bearish sentiment in the market,'' said
William Hinton, an energy broker with Stotler &amp; Co.
   Those views were supported Tuesday by a trade report on European
crude oil stocks that showed supplies increasing there.
   After the close of trading in New York, the American Petroleum
Institute released its weekly report on U.S. petroleum stocks,
showing an 8.1-million barrel rise in U.S. crude supplies.
   The API report far surpassed the expectations of even the most
bearish analysts, who had expected it to show, at most, a
3-million-barrel buildup.
   One reason for the unexpectedly large increase in crude supplies
was an unforeseen 1.8 percent decrease in refinery activity. At
this time of year, oil refineries usually increase activity after
seasonal shutdowns to adjust for greater gasoline production.
   Cocoa futures soared on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, largely in reaction renewed fears of supply disruptions
in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.
   Cocoa futures settled $66 to $76 higher with May at $1,329 a
ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa contract since
last April 20.
   ``What really got the market roiled up was at midday you had
talk of escalating problems there with possible closures of
gasoline stations and a possible port strike,'' said Merrill Lynch
analyst Judy Ganes.
   Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc. said a dock
strike may already have begun.
   Gold and silver futures slipped on New York's Commodity
Exchange. Gold futures settled $1 to $1.10 lower with April at $375
a troy ounce; silver fell 1.3 cents to 1.7 cents with May at $5.113
a troy ounce.
   Corn futures posted moderate gains on the Chicago Board of Trade
for the eighth time in the last nine sessions, reflecting increased
export sales. Soybean futures retreated and wheat finished mixed.
   After the close, the USDA released a supply-and-demand report
indicating demand for corn and soybeans has picked up a bit, so
year-end stockpiles may be smaller than forecast previously.
   The drop in projected Sept. 1 corn inventories to 1.33 billion
bushels from last month&amp;s~e 1\ cents higher across the board with
May at $1.51 a bushel; soybeans were } cent to 2{ cents lower with
May at $5.91 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, helped by stronger cash markets. The April live cattle
contract traded as high as 80.25 cents a pound, matching the
all-time high posted in 1979.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent to .30 cent higher with
April at 80.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .38
cent higher with April at 84.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent to .62 cent higher with April at 55.37 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to 1.23 cents higher with May at
55.80 cents a pound.

   Investor Harold Simmons said Tuesday he failed in

shareholder issues, including seeking to abolish the company's
so-called poison pill.
   Citing preliminary tallies, Simmons said four shareholders'
rights proposals each received 57 percent to 97 percent of the
votes cast at last month's annual shareholders meeting.
   Incumbent Lockheed directors were re-elected with between 58
percent and 61 percent of the votes each, the billionaid.
   Lockheed, maker of the stealth fighter and other military
hardware, said its directors won with 62 percent of the vote. The
Calabasas, Calif., company also confirmed the outcome of the
shareholders' rights provisions, but did not reveal specifiire investor
sacs.
   Lockheed said its nominees won 78 percent of the vote of
shareholders not controlled by Simmons. The results are
preliminary, and will not be official until Monday, Lockheed
spokesman Steve Shadet said.
   ``It appears we achieved a clean sweep on the issues of
confidential voting, opting out of the Delaware anti-takeover law,
abolition of the poison pill and anti-greenmail,'' said Simmons,
who controls about 19 percent of Lockheed stock.

Tuesday, sending crude oil prices to their lowest level in more
than a year.
   Analysts blamed the recent price decline on sizeable supplies
and production while demand has been weaker than expected.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, lost 76 cents to settle at $17.68 per
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 71
cents on Monday.
   Later contracts posted smaller losses Tuesday. The May
settlement price was the lowest for a near-month contract for West
Texas Intermediate since it finished below $17 a barrel in February
1989, according to Elders Futures Inc.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders,
said West Texas Intermediate has fallen 27 percent in the past 11
weeks.
   Analysts cited recent reports that indicate the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has been producing 24 million barrels
of oil a day with no signs of a letup.
   In addition, they said the normal maintenance periods for many
oil refineries are ending and the refineries should soon resume
production.
   At the same time, they said demand for oil has been weak with
big customers either placing smaller orders because of weak
business conditions or postponing purchases in anticipation of
further price declines.
   ``With heavy imports coming in, weaker than expected demand and
good stocks already, this market has no other way but to go down
under the weight of in excess of 2 million barrels a day of
crude,'' said James Steel, energy analyst for the brokerage Refco
Inc. in New York.
   Bob Baker, oil analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said he estimates OPEC is producing 1.5 million barrels a day more
than the market can sustain and said ``they have shown no
indications of moving down.''
   Gasoline futures also dropped sharply on Tuesday on the New York
Merc.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline settled 2.46
cents lower at 58.43 cents a gallon, after Monday's drop of 1.22
cents. Later contract months had smaller losses.
   The decline in home heating oil prices was not as sharp.
   May home heating oil fell 0.67 cent to 52.40 cents a gallon,
after falling 0.64 cent on Monday. Later contracts posted bigger
declines.
   Prudential Bache's Baker said the steep decline in gasoline
futures may have reflected an earlier overestimation of how strong
demand would be.
   ``We have been seeing 1 and 2 percent less consumption here than
we had last year,'' he said.
   He said the more subdued decline in home heating oil may reflect
some lingering demand because of unexpectedly cold weather in some
parts of the country.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.620 per
million British thermal units, down from $1.637 on Monday.
Contracts for delivery further in the future were also lower.

   Motorola Inc. said sales rose 16.5
percent in the first quarter, reflecting strong growth in its
cellular telephone businesses, but profits grew by only 3.3 percent.
   Motorola, based in this Chicago suburb, said net income rose to
$127 million or 98 cents a share in the first three months of 1990
compared with $123 million or 95 cents a share a year earlier.
Sales rose to $2.53 billion from $2.175 billion.
   Sales climbed 53 percent in the company's general systems
sector, which includes its cellular telephone and computer
operations, spokesman George Grimsdrud said.
   ``In the communications arena, the cellular telephone business
continues to expand rapidly,'' said George Fisher, chairman and
chief executive officer, in a statement.
   ``Higher orders for two-way radios and paging products indicate
that our investments in these technologies also should result in
sizeable growth.''
   Semiconductor sales rose 13 percent in the latest period and
orders rose 14 percent, but operating profits declined, Motorola
said.
   ``There are some promising early indications of renewed strength
in the semiconductor industry,'' Fisher said. ``We are confident
that our focus on quality, efficient short-cycle production, and
customer satisfaction should enable us to gain greater shares of
growth electronics markets.''

   The dollar declined sharply Tuesday against most
major currencies in thin, see-saw trading as concerns about
continued central-bank intervention dampened market sentiment.
   Gold prices also fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $375 a troy ounce, $1
lower than late Monday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $375.50 an ounce, off 15 cents.
   Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of
New York, said traders were reluctant to buy dollars for fear major
central banks would intervene to drive the dollar down again.
   Several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, sold
dollars in Europe and Asia to help stem the yen's decline on
Monday. That action followed a weekend meeting in Paris in which
the major industrialized nations, known as the Group of Seven,
agreed to closely monitor developments in the yen.
   The Japanese currency has been under pressure lately amid
growing signs of a weakening Japanese economy and a sharp decline
on the Tokyo stock market.
   Also helping to weaken the dollar Tuesday were reported comments
from West German Finance Minister Helmut Haussmann that he expects
the mark to firm as a result of a planned economic and monetary
unification of East and West Germany, currency dealers said.
   Trading was described as thin Tuesday because of the Passover
holiday and in advance of the upcoming Easter holiday.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar climbed 1.70
yen to a closing 158.15 yen on Tuesday. It was quoted at 158.60 yen
in London, and at 157.60 yen in New York, down from 158.335 Monday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling sold in
London for $1.6345, down from $1.6397; and for $1.64515 in New
York, up from $1.63445 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6750 West German marks, down from 1.6935;
1.4830 Swiss francs, down from 1.4982; 5.6285 French francs, down
from 5.6845; 1,230.16 Italian lire, down from 1,243.00; and 1.16925
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1616.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6900 West
German marks, down from 1.6923 marks; 1.4955 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4960; 5.6750 French francs, down from 5.6805; 1.9030 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9043; 1,240.00 Italian lire, down from
1,242.00; and 1.1613 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1615.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $375.15 an ounce,
down from $375.50 late Monday. Gold also fell in Zurich to $375.25
an ounce from $376.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed down $2.16
at $376.97 an ounce.
   Silver prices also weakened. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.091 a troy ounce, down from
$5.104 late Monday. Silver fell in London to $5.13 an ounce from
$5.14.

Standards</HEAD>

   Representatives of securities dealers in the
United States and four other nations have agreed to work toward
common international standards for settling trades.
   However, officials who wrapped up a two-day meeting of the
International Councils of Securities Dealers and Self-Regulatory
Organizations on Tuesday said it may be some years before that can
be achieved.
   ``We start from a position of enormous differences among the
major markets,'' said Stanislas M. Yassukovich of The Securities
Association, a self-regulating organization of brokers in Great
Britain.
   For instance, stock trades are settled in five days in the
United States, three days in Japan and after a much longer period
in European countries.
   The representatives also agreed to regularly share confidential
information needed to regulate international securities trading.
   The international group was founded in 1988 to promote effective
regulation of cross-border securities trading. Its members include
groups from the United States, Britain, Japan, France and Canada.
   According to Joseph R. Hardiman, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, cross-border stock trading has
increased 16-fold since 1979 to $1.5 trillion a year. Such trading
is expected to near $5 trillion by the end of the decade, he said.
   This week's gathering was the group's third meeting. The next is
scheduled in 1991 in London.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Says Net Income Up 11 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Tuesday its
first-quarter profit increased 11 percent in part because of the
sales of two radio stations and a minority interest in a nuclear
power project.
   For the three months ending March 30, Westinghouse posted net
income of $210 million, or $1.43 per share, up from $189 million,
or $1.30 per share, in 1989's first quarter.
   Net income in the year-ago period included a gain from the sale
of a minority cable-television interest.
   Revenue dropped 0.9 percent to $2.86 billion from $2.89 billion
a year ago. However, after adjusting for the 1989 first-quarter
sale of transmission and distribution businesses, revenue rose 10
percent, the company said.
   Westinghouse Chairman John C. Marous said the company received
more orders for its electric systems and power generation divisions.
   Westinghouse said revenue and operating profit in its financial
services division went up because it had more outstanding loans and
marketable securities.
   In broadcasting, operating profit dropped because of ``the
softness of the Northeast market,'' while revenue held steady, the
company said.
   In energy and utilities, operating profit rose on higher sales
by the power generation division. In industries, revenue and
operating profit rose slightly, and recent acquisitions raised
revenue and operating profit in the furniture unit.
   Revenue and operating profit also rose in the electronic systems
unit, Westinghouse said.

   Two striking Greyhound drivers in Missouri
were arrested Tuesday in connection with the shooting at
passenger-occupied buses near St. Louis last month, federal agents
said.
   Those arrested were Roy B. Simes, 35, and Harry T. Lewis, 42,
both of suburban St. Louis, said Stephen Higgins, director of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   There were no injuries in either of the March 22 incidents. One
involved a bus traveling on Interstate 55 about 12 miles south of
St. Louis and the other was just across the state line in
Collinsville, Ill.
   The federal agency announced last week it was investigating the
more than two dozen Greyhound shootings that have occurred since
6,300 drivers and 3,000 other workers walked off the job March 2
over wages and job security.
   Both men were charged before a federal magistrate in St. Louis
with three federal crimes _ endangering people on board a vehicle
used in interstate or foreign commerce; commission of a felony with
a firearm that has been transported in interstate commerce and use
of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, the agency
said.
   Spokesman Tom Hill said U.S. Magistrate Richard Buckles ordered
the men held without bond pending another hearing at 2 p.m.
Wednesday.
   If convicted, the men could face up to 10 years in jail and a
$10,000 fine. Using a firearm during the commission of a felony
carries a mandatory five-year jail term.
   The two St. Louis arrests were the agency's first since getting
involved; an arrest in a Hartford, Conn., shooting incident has
been the only other arrest. That also involved a striking driver.
   There were no new bargaining developments. Talks between
Greyhound Lines Inc. and the union have been stalled since March
18, and the company said it will not resume negotiations until a
week goes by without any acts of violence.
   Along with the nearly 30 shootings at buses and more than 100
bomb threats, the union contends there have been more than 60
incidents of violence against striking workers. One striker was
crushed to death by a bus in Redding, Calif., on March 3.
   Greyhound, the only nationwide bus system, has been operating on
a reduced schedule with replacement drivers they hired and union
members who crossed the picket line.

<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. said it had sold its
British division, Arthur Sanderson and Sons Ltd., to the Dutch
textile group Gamma Holding N.V. for $96.5 million.
   The sale announced Tuesday was seen as another move by Chicago
industrialist William Farley to raise the necessary cash to
complete his acquisition of Pepperell, the big Georgia-based
textile company. Farley owns 95 percent of Pepperell's stock.
   Calls to Farley's company, Farley Inc., were not returned
Tuesday.
   The collapse of the junk bond market has dealt a severe blow to
Farley's expansion plans. Last week, the Farley subsidiary formed
to acquire Pepperell announced it had defaulted on $1.5 billion
worth of loan and bond payments.
   Farley is trying to restructure a $796 million loan obtained
from a consortium of banks for the Pepperell buyout. Unless the
loan is restructured, analysts say, Farley may be forced to sell
more assets to raise enough money to complete the Pepperell
acquisition.
   Farley's other properties include Fruit of the Loom Inc. and
Acme Boots.
   Pepperell manufactures apparel and bedding sold under such
brands as Ralph Lauren, Martex, Lady Pepperell, Esprit and Utica.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T-Memorex-Telex Announce Deal on Mainframe Controllers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Memorex-Telex N.V. has agreed to
purchase most of AT&amp;T's synchronous terminal products business,
which includes mainframe-compatible terminal displays, printers and
software, the companies said.
   Under the agreement announced Tuesday, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. will receive royalties from Memorex-Telex for five
years from the sale of equipment designed to connect with IBM's
3270 system and the sale of personal computers.
   AT&amp;T also will acquire an equity stake in Memorex-Telex.
Although the companies didn't disclose the size of the stake, AT&amp;T
last week said it would acquire between 5 percent and 10 percent of
the Dutch company.
   AT&amp;T will continue to manufacture the mainframe computer
equipment for at least two years and provide Memorex-Telex access
to technology and software developed at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories,
the statement said.
   ``Both AT&amp;T and Memorex-Telex currently offer strong
complementary product lines,'' Charles E. Yates, president of
AT&amp;T's synchronous terminal products unit, said in a statement.
   He said customers would benefit by a wider selection of choices
to serve their data communication needs.
   Giorgio Ronchi, chief executive officer of Memorex-Telex, said
the move would enhance the company's financial position by
providing new revenue.
   ``With our access to worldwide markets and AT&amp;T's strength in
research and development, we have a winning combination that can
compete anywhere for function and performance,'' Ronchi said.
   Memorex-Telex, based in Amsterdam, resulted from the 1987
purchase of Tulsa, Okla.-based Telex Corp., a computer systems
maker, by the former Memorex International NV. The company makes a
variety of computers and computer products and operates in 27
countries. Its American subsidiary is based in Morristown.
   Memorex-Telex had 1989 sales of $2.24 billion, said Julia C.
Gentz, a company spokeswoman in Tulsa. It has about 10,000
employees, including 6,500 in the United States, she said.
