   A Louisiana House committee Thursday
voted to ban abortions except in cases where pregnancy endangers a
mother's life, a bill supporters hope will provide a landmark court
test.
   Sponsors hope the measure, if approved by the full Legislature,
to be the vehicle for a challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion.
   House Criminal Justice Committee members approved the bill
without comment or objection. The vote ended two days of hearings in
which anti-abortion and abortion rights advocates were each given
four hours to state their cases.
   Anti-abortion sentiment is strong in both the full House and the
Senate.
   Abortionists would face up to 10 years in prison at hard labor
for violating the law if it were approved.
   In hearings, the committee tried to build a record of testimony
and evidence that will lead to a reversal of Roe vs. Wade.
   The committee heeded the plea of Rep. Woody Jenkins, D-Baton
Rouge, to avoid amending the bill to make exceptions in cases of
rape or incest.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, calling himself ``a pro-lifer,'' said he would
veto any bill that doesn't contain those exceptions.
   Similar bills now are on both the House and Senate floors.
   Abortion-rights forces predicted the hoped-for challenge to Roe
vs. Wade would fail if the law were passed.
   ``The state will wind up spending $3 million and we will look
ridiculous,'' said Robin Rothrock, president of the League of Women
Voters.
   Jenkins, floor leader for the anti-abortion forces, noted that
legal experts had testified that a law without exceptions and with
criminal penalties would likely bring a legal challenge that could
reach the Supreme Court and test Roe vs. Wade.

<HEAD>Knoxville Newspapers to Dissolve Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's morning and afternoon
newspapers agreed Friday to dissolve their joint operating
agreement, ending The Knoxville News-Sentinel's lawsuit against The
Knoxville Journal.
   Owners of The News-Sentinel and Journal announced they had
reached an agreement in principle to end their 4-year-old pact by
the end of December 1991.
   After the agreement ends, ``The Journal intends to publish
separately and in competition with The News-Sentinel,'' the
statement said.
   Under the joint operating agreement, The News-Sentinel provides
sales, production and distribution for The Journal. Editorial
departments of the two newspapers are separate.
   Under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, the attorney
general can approve a limited antitrust exemption if he finds one
paper is in danger of failing and a joint operating agreement would
ensure survival of independent editorial voices.
   
   The lawsuit alleged The Journal's owner, Persis Corp., violated
terms of the agreement when the Hawaii company purchased The
(Maryville) Daily Times in neighboring Blount County in December.
Journal editor and publisher Gerald Garcia also was made president
and publisher of The Daily Times.
   The News-Sentinel, which recently began a zoned edition in
Maryville, considered The Daily Times a direct competitor.
   The lawsuit contended that with Garcia in the dual roles, The
Daily Times would have access to The News-Sentinel's confidential
business information and trade secrets.
   As part of the termination arrangement, The News-Sentinel will
pay Persis $40 million in two $20 million installments. The money
will be in lieu of payments The Journal would have received from
Dec. 31, 1991, through the scheduled end of the agreement on Dec.
31, 2005.
   The News-Sentinel is owned by the E.W. Scripps Co. of Cincinnati.
The morning paper has a daily circulation of 101,000 and a Sunday
circulation of 169,000. The Journal is an afternoon paper that
publishes Monday through Saturday with a circulation of 40,000.
   ``We are pleased with the agreement,'' said Thurston Twigg-Smith,
president and chief executive of Persis, which publishes six daily
newspapers, including The Honolulu Advertiser, and three weeklies.
   ``Once we concluded that it was unlikely that the JOA would be
extended beyond 2005, we wanted to begin separate publication at a
time when The Journal was a strong and vital part of the Knoxville
community,'' he said.
   Scripps president and chief executive Lawrence A. Leser said he
was also satisfied with the settlement.
   ``This one-time payment is less than the expected amount The
News-Sentinel would have paid in distributions to The Journal had
joint operations continued through 2005,'' said Leser, whose company
owns 19 daily newspapers.
   ``We look forward to hardy economic competition in addition to
the fierce editorial competition that has existed between the two
newspapers for many years.''
   Until the termination in 1991, The News-Sentinel will continue to
act as agent on certain business matters for The Journal under a
special interim agreement that provides for The Journal's
``reasonable prospects for ongoing economic viability.''

<TEXT>
   The University of Michigan is searching
for a term to replace ``freshman'' in describing the first year of a
woman's college experience.
   Mary Jo Frank, editor of the faculty and staff newspaper
University Record, asked readers for their ideas. Of the 30
suggestions submitted, ``freshmore'' was the most common, but
``neophyte'' was the most emphatic.
   ``Neo would be neat-o,'' since ``neophytos'' is Greek for newly
planted, said David C. King, a political science doctoral candidate.
   King said neophyte would be an easy term for students to pick up,
since it would be fun ``bastardizing Greek.''
   If neophyte seems too esoteric, other suggestions included
firsty, alphamore, freshper, rookie, probationer, collegian and
tenderfoot.
   One respondent suggested changing ``freshman'' would lead to
substitutions for other masculine terms such as bachelor's and
master's.
   Walter Harrison, a spokesman for the Ann Arbor school, said the
university would consider dropping the term ``freshman''' if an
acceptable replacement were found.
   Some colleges and high schools have started using ``fresher'' and
``frosh,'' according to ``The Nonsexist Word Finder,'' a 1988
reference book.

   The county prosecutor said Friday night that no
charges would be filed against a man whose car plowed through a
baseball diamond, killing three children during a Little League game.
   Cook County State's Attorney Cecil Partee said that filing
criminal charges against James J. Harasek, 59, of Westchester was
``not appropriate.''
   Partee said in a news release that neither drugs nor alcohol was
involved in the May 5 tragedy. He also said there wasn't enough
evidence to prove that Harasek illegally disregarded the safety of
others, a finding necessary to press criminal charges.
   Harasek lost control of his Cadillac as the Little League T-ball
game began at a baseball diamond in the Chicago suburb of Riverside.
The car smashed through a bench full of players and and continued
across the field.
   Three children were killed and nine people injured, six of them
children.
   A $5 million lawsuit filed on behalf of one of the injured
children alleges Harasek continued to drive although he knew he was
prone to losing consciousness.
   Harasek's driver's license was revoked because of the accident.

   A court has given six-month jail terms to each of
three neo-royalists who attacked an opera singer performing rebel
songs during last year's bicentennial celebration of the French
Revolution.
   Christophe de Peyrelongue, 24, and 29-year-old twins Philippe and
Giovanni Castelluccio were among 20 people who stormed the Bouffes

Helene Delavault.
   The group hurled tear gas into the crowd and threw blue paint on
Ms. Delavault's clothing and glue on her hair. They then fled,
shouting: ``Long live the king!''
   Ms. Delavault gave her remaining performances under police guard.
President Francois Mitterrand expressed outrage over the incident.
   On Thursday, the Correctional Tribunal gave the three defendants
a one-year sentence but suspended six months. The court also ordered
each to pay one franc (about 17 cents) in symbolic damages.

   Korean Air, the country's flagship
carrier, has obtained Beijing's approval to fly its only weekly
Middle East flight through Chinese airspace beginning today, company
officials said.
   It was the first time that China, which has no diplomatic
relations with South Korea, has authorized a regular flight of the
airline, known as KAL, to use its airspace.
   The decision was seen by observers as a further indication of
improving relations between Seoul and Beijing. Although China is a
longtime ally of Communist North Korea, it has been expanding trade
and other unofficial contacts with South Korea.
   The Chinese decision will enable KAL Flight 801 to fly through
Chinese air space en route to Tripoli, Libya.
   KAL officials said they were negotiating to fly all of their 10
European weekly flights through Chinese air space.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: How Superpowers Resolved the Nicaragua Conflict</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dec. 7 is a date normally identified with the
death and destruction at Pearl Harbor, but for American and Soviet
diplomats it has also come to signify a momentous but little-known
development in East-West relations.
   It was on that day last year that the Soviet Union, under heavy
U.S. pressure, ordered the freighter Vladimir Ilyich back to its
home port rather than deliver its cargo of four MI-17 Hip military
helicopters to Nicaragua.
   That move is perhaps the clearest single piece of evidence to
date of the Soviets' willingness to sacrifice the interests of an
ally in order to advance the cause of superpower cooperation.
   As Washington saw it, President Mikhail Gorbachev was long on
words but short on deeds on many of his policies. The recall of the
freighter was, by those standards, an extraordinary deed.
   It was one of the high points of what, until now, has been the
largely untold story of the private exchanges that took place
between Washington and Moscow on Central America during President
Bush's first year in office.
   A lengthy account of what transpired appears in the June 4 issue
of Time magazine.
   In ordering the Vladimir Ilyich home, the Soviets put back on
track a process in which the superpowers cooperated in promoting a
free and fair election process in Nicaragua, culminating in the Feb.
25 triumph of U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro.
   The result is that of all the regional conflicts in which the
Soviets and the Americans became involved on opposite sides during
the 1980s _ Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and Cambodia _ only
Nicaragua has been resolved peacefully.
   After a decade of bitter debate at home and with Moscow as well,
Nicaragua now has become, in large measure, an issue of secondary
priority for Washington. The impossible actually happened: following
an honest election, the leftist Sandinista government of Daniel
Ortega turned power over to the pro-U.S. opposition.
   On no issue had U.S. policy changed more in the transition from
Presidents Reagan to Bush than Central America.
   To the distress of some old State Department hands, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III seemed almost contemptuous of the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels and less than enthralled by the overall
issue of Central America. He appeared to spend all of his time
dealing with Europeans.
   But as the Time account suggests, both Bush and Baker, along with
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson, engaged in titanic _
albeit private _ struggles with the Soviets on Central America.
   Their strategy was to try to influence Soviet actions in Central
America by threatening to deny them American goodwill in other
areas. In diplomatic parlance, that connection is known as
``linkage.''
   Not surprisingly, the path to Soviet-American cooperation was
bumpy. The crucial period occurred in late November when, addition
to U.S. concerns about Hip helicopter shipments to Nicaragua, the
Sandinistas got caught trying to send 24 surface-to-air missiles to
the leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Washington's reaction was such that the Soviets were afraid Bush
would call off the Dec. 2 summit with Gorbachev in Malta. Hoping to
avoid a crisis in the summit's aftermath, the Soviets recalled the
Vladimir Ilyich.
   Things went more smoothly thereafter. The Soviets promised to
urge Cuba to limit weapons deliveries to Central America and also
assured Washington that they would refrain from sending weapons to
the Sandinistas if Mrs. Chamorro won.
   In February, Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze pledged to respect the outcome of free and fair
elections in Nicaragua. All along, Washington did its part by
refusing to rearm the Contras and by encouraging them not only to
refrain from undertaking military offensives but also to join the
election process.
   A footnote: The Soviets eventually sent the Hip helicopters to
Nicaragua at the end of January. As a Soviet analyst told Time, the
Kremlin felt a goodwill gesture was needed to ensure Moscow's
continued ability to convince the Sandinistas to stick by their
pledge to hold honest elections.
   The Soviets did something else to placate Washington: they sent
the helicopters equipped for civilian use only.

<TEXT>
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a
solid majority to win his sixth straight Democratic nomination. But,
like a boxing champion who slipped by on points, he is being asked
to explain the lack of a knockout punch.
   Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when first
elected in 1978 and he has had a stranglehold on the state's
Democratic Party ever since.
   But in last week's primary, he garnered just 55 percent of the
vote while Tom McRae, an unpolished campaigner who heads a public
policy think tank, earned 39 percent. Four also-rans divided the
rest.
   Clinton, who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in
1988 and already is talking about 1996, said he saw no cause for
concern in the margin of his primary victory.
   ``I didn't see how I could get 60 percent, knowing the number of
people who were saying in the surveys that they thought I was a good
governor but were concerned about the tenure issue,'' Clinton said
recently.
   Tenure was summed up repeatedly by McRae as ``10 years is long
enough.''
   Arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters
elsewhere, Clinton said, in part because politics in the state is so
personal. Pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is
considered as important as running the right television ad.
   ``I'm just trying to tell people that in business they wouldn't
fire a 43-year-old with 10 years of experience who's doing a good
job,'' Clinton said days before the primary.
   Sheffield Nelson, who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination, already is jumping on the
theme, saying ``Arkansas is ready for a change.''
   Clinton, who has focused on improving the state's education
system, counters by calling himself the candidate of change.
   ``Frankly, if you look at what I proposed, compared with the
others, it represents more change,'' he said. ``Ten years is an
asset, not a liability.''
   Clinton lost his first re-election bid in 1980 to Republican
Frank White, but won again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the
gubernatorial term was changed to four years. He has all but
promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this
year.
   His showing in this year's primary, largely in line with
pre-election polls, was the first time since his political comeback
in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote.
   ``I'm sure the governor would like to have made a better showing,
but when you're in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a
lot of enemies,'' said Bill Paschall, a Little Rock political
consultant. ``I don't think it's a death blow that he made 55
(percent), but it shows him he has to work harder.''
   While the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that he
has been in office too long, the governor also has been accused of
being more interested in his national ambitions than state concerns.
   Clinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a
sticking point. Twice in 1989 he failed to win legislative approval
for proposals to increase taxes.
   Nelson, who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat,
said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes.
   ``I'd say against an unknown who never held an office, I think
that was low. It probably did make some bells go off in his head,''
Nelson said.
   Clinton said he would have done better if a large number of
traditional Democrats hadn't crossed over to the GOP primary to vote
against Robinson.
   ``We did poorly in areas where I did not campaign; where my
supporters, in spite of my best interest, believed the polls and
didn't work; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what
I had done that affected their lives; and where people knew there
was an alternative but didn't know much about what the alternative
was,'' Clinton said.
   Betsey Wright, Clinton's former chief of staff, said the
governor's supporters were complacent.
   ``Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people
find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight
energies,'' she said of the primary.

<HEAD>NIOSH Links Computer Use to RSI Problems at Newsday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study conducted for Newsday and its
union shows there is ``significant association'' between computer
keyboard work and repetitive strain injury, one of the researchers
said Thursday.
   The study, the first comprehensive survey of repetitive strain
injury in the newspaper industry in this country, also concluded
that computer terminal use among workers at Newsday and New York
Newsday presented ``a hazard to workers' health.'' It did not
quantify or elaborate on the risks.
   The study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health and the University of Michigan found no single cause for the
injuries, Cincinnati-based NIOSH researcher Susan Burt said in a
telephone interview.
   She said several factors contribute to the risk of getting
repetitive strain injury, or RSI, including:
   _Repetitive motions like those made while typing on a computer
keyboard.
   _Work positions, like extending the wrists up in an awkward
position in order to type.
   _Static position, caused by holding arms up in order to type.
   The study also found that how long a person worked at a keyboard
without a break and how fast they typed contributed to problems
associated with RSI. ``We do not recommend working at a keyboard for
extended periods without taking a break,'' she said. No specific
time limit was given.
   The study group included 834 workers at Newsday and New York
Newsday. They included reporters, editors, clerical and secretarial
employees who worked in the editorial, financial, advertising and
circulation departments.
   Burt said the employees were asked if they had experienced any
pain, aching numbness, tingling or burning in their hands-wrists,
elbow, shoulder and neck area within a 12-month period.
   By definition, she said the pain had to last at least a week or
occur at least once a month. They also had to have no previous
history of acute injury to the area and the pain had to have started
on their current job.
   Survey results showed that 331 of the 834 employees, or 40
percent, reported one or more symptoms in at least one of the four
regions some time within the past year.
   Burt cautioned that the results were based on self-reporting and
said NIOSH estimated they were ``twice as high than if we had done
physical examinations as well as questionnaires.''
   Of all the employees questioned, she said ``reporters appeared to
be at higher risk'' than the other workers.
   Some believed that the type of keyboard used may contribute to
RSI, but Burt said ``we found no significant difference.''
Researchers did say, however, that work stations crowded with
computers, desks, chairs and other equipment could contribute to the
problem.
   Repetitive strain injury is listed as the leading cause of
occupational illness by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
bureau said 115,400 cases of RSI were reported nationwide in 1988,
representing 48 percent of all workplace illnesses.
   The malady has been reported in a wide range of workers including
office employees, assembly-line jobs and within the meatpacking
industry.
   The study was requested by Newsday and the Graphics Communication
International Union Local 406, which represents nearly half of the
newspaper's 3,100 full-time employees.
   Burt said they began their research last August. The report is to
be released in a few days. It was given to Newsday and its union
leaders on Tuesday and the results were published Wednesday.
   Researchers recommended that Newsday establish a labor-management
committee to handle RSI problems and train employees on how to use
adjustable equipment and change their work habits.
   Assistant Managing Editor Robert Keane said the newspaper has
already initiated those recommendations.
   John McDonald, vice president of the union's editorial unit, said
further studies may be done to show how individual work habits and
equipment contributes to RSI.
   Burt said the agency is beginning work on two more studies on RSI
at the Los Angeles Times and U.S. West, a large telecommunications
company.

<HEAD>Accord Reached to Save Jobs With Weapons Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and the Pentagon are ending months of
haggling with an informal agreement to save tens of thousands of
military jobs by shifting money from major weapons programs,
including land-based missiles.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
late Thursday decided to give the Pentagon the authority to transfer
about $1.5 billion from weapons programs to payroll accounts.
   The money will allow the Defense Department to avoid dismissing
thousands of men and women by October. The funds also will make up
for a financial shortfall in the health insurance plan for military
dependents, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed
Services.
   Among the reductions are $8 million from the MX rail-garrison
missile program, $10 million from the Midgetman missile, $20 million
from the Trident missile submarine and $20 million from the Seawolf
attack submarine.
   The tentative accord puts an end to bitter squabbling between the
Pentagon and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   However, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on
the Armed Services panel, accused Aspin of holding the process
hostage to a package of weapons cuts that is significantly less than
what the chairman sought.
   ``What the speaker and the secretary finally agreed on bears
little resemblance to the chairman's demands. Consequently, one
cannot help but wonder what was accomplished by all this in the
end,'' Dickinson said in a statement.
   Aspin's press secretary, Lynn Reddy, said the chairman had no
immediate comment.
   Such shifts of money _ known as ``reprogramming'' _ are
customarily submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services
committees and the two chambers' defense appropriations
subcommittees.
   In this case, Cheney had authority to proceed on his own, and he
had threatened to do so if no agreement were reached.
   The Pentagon said it needed the transfer authority to avoid
massive layoffs that would have been required under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   It estimated that it would have to discharge up to 68,000 of its
2.1 million uniformed personnel and deny enlistment to as many as
115,900 potential recruits, among other steps, unless given relief.
   Earlier this year, Aspin, with the backing of Foley, declined to
bring the Pentagon request before his committee. He argued that
President Bush could have exempted military personnel from the
Gramm-Rudman law but decided against it last year.
   Aspin charged that Bush favored weapons over people.
   As a solution, Aspin proposed some of Cheney's favored weapons
programs, including the B-2 stealth bomber, the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the MX missile and the Seawolf submarine, as a source of
funds for the personnel accounts.
   All total, Aspin called for $230 million from the strategic
programs. Cheney and Foley reached a tentative agreement on $58
million from those weapons systems as well as about $1.4 billion
from other programs.
   Late last month, Cheney said he had the agreement of the chairmen
and ranking members of the respective committees, with the exception
of Aspin.
   Dickinson said he was pleased that ``men of common sense like
Dick Cheney and Tom Foley were able to find a solution.
Unfortunately, it's one that shouldn't have taken six months to
arrive at.''

<TEXT>
   A new exhibit in Budapest recalls the
shadow of Stalinism that covered half of Europe for more than 40
years.
   It is called ``Sta-lin! Ra-ko-si!'' and is the first in Eastern
Europe to depict the day-to-day life of the 1950s.
   Hungary's Stalin was Matyas Rakosi, who was installed by the
Soviet dictator and ruled unchallenged. Stalin died in 1953, byt
Rakosi's reign lasted until the 1956 uprising against Stalinism,
which was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   The exhibit, constructed like a labyrinth, is in a castle on a
hill above the Danube River. It includes newspaper headlines,
photographs, uniforms of feared men, soiled clothing of the beaten
and belongings of the executed.
   Emil Horn, who conceived it, said he wanted to juxtapose the
truth and the Rakosi regime's representation of itself.
   ``Those days were very sad,'' He said in an interview. ``Now,
there is a great irony.''
   A giant reprint of a cartoon from the period depicts mice
marching behind a placard of a grinning cat. Next to it are equally
large photos of Hungarians marching behind portraits of Rakosi and
Stalin.
   The exhibit focuses on the Rakosi era, but repeatedly draws
comparisons with the Soviet Union, showing nearly identical
uniforms, medals and even constitutions.
   A cast-bronze head of Rakosi adorns a three-tier podium,
recalling the cakes each village, factory and school sent him on his
60th birthday.
   The podium is piled high with presents: hand-stitched banners,
painted vases and flasks depicting the glories of communism. There
is sheet music of hymns to the leader.
   Up a few steps, in a mausoleum-like chamber, are even more
elaborate gifts to Stalin.
   The exhibit also notes differences between Stalinism in the
Soviet Union and Hungary.
   ``Here, it lasted only seven to eight years,'' Horn said. ``Due
to the liberal trends in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the whole
region, it would have taken much longer to completely suppress the
people than in Russia.''
   Horn is a former Communist who believed firmly in Marxism when
the Soviets liberated Hungary. About what came later, he said: ``We
are ashamed of ourselves.''
   His exhibit ``contains my personal self-criticism as well,'' Horn
said. ``For me, it is a kind of absolution. I didn't hurt anyone,
but still, it is absurd that I and so many people were so stupid.
... Why was I so ignorant?'' Millions of people in Eastern Europe
are asking themselves that question.
   In his New Year's address, President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia said all Czechoslovaks shared responsibility for
Communist rule and cautioned against simply blaming leaders for the
excesses.
   An exhibit about Czechoslovakia's history since 1918 opened in
Prague last month. It is part of a general effort in what once was
the Soviet bloc to express the truth of history and strip away
Stalinist falsehoods.
   Budapest's Rakosi exhibit shows how the Communists rigged the
1947 elections, then chronicles the dissolution of other parties,
collectivization of land and experiments in economic
self-sufficiency that even included a short-lived attempt to grow
cotton.
   The second part of the exhibit has the atmosphere of an
interrogation chamber, courtroom and prison camp.
   Documents listing charges against prominent victims of the Rakosi
regime are displayed along with photographs and personal belongings.
They include Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty and former Interior Minister
Laszlo Rajk, who was hanged as a ``Titoist.''
   In a depiction of the notorious labor camp at Recsk, where many
people died, are huge prints of photos taken secretly by an inmate
who now lives in the West.
   A small cabinet displays such banned materials as Carlo Collodi's
``Pinocchio,'' Disney cartoons and ``The Jungle Book,'' by Rudyard
Kipling
   Looming over the exit is a border guard tower bearing two
figures: 18,000, the number of people allowed to travel outside the
country in 1951, and 10 million, the number in 1989.
   Across from the tower are statues of Rakosi and Stalin, toppled,
as they were after protesters pulled them down at beginning of the
uprising Oct. 23, 1956. Stalin's fist is in the dirt.
   One visitor wrote in the guest book: ``Thank God we haven't seen
this in our lives.'' Another wrote below: ``Unfortunately we have.''
   Still another echoed Horn: ``I'm ashamed that the Hungarian
people were willing to accept all this for decades.''

   A Tucson woman died Thursday after lying out in the
sun for at least six hours, hospital officials said.
   The 37-year-old woman was unconscious when she was admitted to
Tucson Medical Center Wednesday afternoon. Her identity was withheld.
   The woman had a body temperature of 107 degrees and badly burned
flesh, officials said.
   The temperature in Tucson reached 107 Wednesday.
   ``She was packed in ice immediately, but she was already into
severe sunstroke and had lapsed into a coma,'' said TMC spokesman
Tom Reavis. ``She never regained consciousness.''
   Doctors speculated she fell asleep in while sunbathing.

<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   St. Patrick may have chased the snakes from
Ireland, but unlike the winner of an upcoming contest here, he
didn't get a pickup truck for the accomplishment.
   That's what this Pacific island is offering to the person who can
collect the most brown tree snakes in a one-month period starting
June 23.
   The first annual ``Sweep Snakes'' contest is part of an effort to
rid the U.S. territory of the more than 2 million brown tree snakes
that have infested the 212-square-mile island.
   The snakes were accidentally imported to Guam during World War
II, possibly in military cargo shipments from the Solomon Islands.
Since then, they have decimated the native bird population and are
known to bite humans occasionally.
   Although the venom is not lethal to adults, it can put small
infants into shock and, if untreated, can cause death.
   Other prizes in the contest include awards for the longest tree
snake captured and the most innovative trap.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Brian Sokutu, a 28-year-old black journalist, was
detained by security police June 16, 1986 under the national state
of emergency, which President F.W. de Klerk lifted in most of the
country Thursday. Sokutu was imprisoned nearly three years without
being charged with a crime. When he was freed March 9, 1989, he was
issued with restrictions that effectively barred him from practicing
his profession until last February. He wrote this personal account

   ``When are you bringing him
back?'' my frightened sister asked a security policeman on June 16,
1986 _ the day the police detained me under national emergency
regulations decreed four days earlier.
   ``Don't worry, we'll bring him back soon,'' he said. ``Soon''
turned out to be nearly three years.
   When the police came, no one tried to keep them out. The
emergency empowered them to kick in the door anyway.
   After hearing of the detention of other journalists, I thought of
going into hiding. But after moving from house to house, looking for
asylum, I eventually came home. ``How does a journalist go into
hiding?'' I asked myself.
   The next night, the security police left with me. I had a jacket,
a pair of jeans and a woolen hat.
   Algoa Park police station's offices were as busy that night as a
black hospital's casualty ward. We sat on the floor of the cold
waiting rooms until we were fingerprinted and photographed.
   ``Ja Brian, you write a lot in the papers,'' said one of the cops
to me, making me feel like a little boy in a cage.
   One of the horrible experiences you go through in detention is
that of being divorced from your family, your colleagues, and the
outside environment.
   Inside the police station, I was kept with about nine other
people in a filthy, tiny cell with blankets full of lice. We slept
on the floor.
   Each day, we got cold porridge in the morning, two thin slices of
bread and black coffee, served in a big tin for us to share.
   No one knew where we were, as we were denied newspapers, visits,
pens and even clothes to change. I had to use my T-shirt as a
washrag on occasion. My jeans and lumber jacket made perfect pajamas.
   A major breakthrough came sometime in July when we developed
various sorts of ailments _ colds, ulcers, backaches. Some of us
were admitted to Livingstone Hospital and were able to smuggle
letters to our parents and bribe guards with food and money to get
visitors.
   During that period, a detainee would be called for hours of
interrogation. One young detainee, about 16 years old, came back
sobbing.
   ``They've beaten me up,'' he said. He also told of being
subjected to electric shocks.
   It seems the police were trying to prove that I was a
revolutionary journalist who, during the 1985 consumer boycott, took
pictures of people who broke the boycott of white businesses.
According to police allegations, I took the pictures to ``the
people's militia.''
   I went to the Grahamstown Supreme Court to try to prove the
police wrong. The case was dismissed, but I still have to pay the
costs.
   What they could not do was to charge me with a crime.
   Later, I was transferred to St. Albans prison. The difference
between the police station and prison was that we were entitled to
have money, clothes and visits.
   Prison breaks one physically and psychologically, and solitary
confinement is a method of torture.
   I spent three days in a tiny underground cell, which was like
being buried alive. You see no car, hear no noise. On occasion a
policeman walking on a floor above looks at you through a window.
   When you are escorted inside by police, your shoelaces are taken
away. When you try to sleep, you are constantly awakened by police
who say they are guarding against you ``killing yourself.''
   The strain is tremendous. I suffered from depression and had to
be brought back to St. Albans.
   What kept us going for those years of hardship: collective
decision-making, consultation, a political program.
   Ironically, the structures crushed by the state in the African
townships were revived in prison. We had an education panel, a
political panel and sport.
   We had to bribe wardens and hardened criminals with money to get
us newspapers. We even smuggled a small radio to listen to the news.
   Numerous struggles for our release were waged inside and outside
prison. In February of 1989, there was an 11-day hunger strike. It
proved to be instrumental in bringing about our release.

   New evidence that architecture is going to the
dogs: Canine critics at an exhibit of designer doghouses turned up
their wet noses at the modernist ``Bauwauhaus'' and licked their
chops over a ``Dog Cabin'' made of water-proof dog biscuits.
   ``Dog biscuits. That's the secret to good doghouse design,'' said
Russ Post, who held the leash of a tan Labrador retriever. ``Old
Boris here really perked up when he saw them.''
   Old Boris didn't seem to like much of anything else on display
outside the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, which challenged architects and
designers to build a better doghouse for an exhibition that opens
Friday.
   But the dogs who attended a preview of the luxury doghouses
Thursday were confronted with the same architectural woes that dog
human clients: cost overruns, self-indulgent designs, ignorance of
the client's needs.
   Their masters forced them into the doghouses for the benefit of
photographers, but the dogs seemed unimpressed.
   _Cooper, a tan Lab puppy, had to be forced into the sleek,
gleaming white Bauwauhous. After one look around the spare, cold,
Corian plastic interior, he scampered out.
   _Dora, a black Lab pup, sniffed around but refused to enter the
igloo-shaped ``Guardian Dog House,'' possibly because of the
250-pound sculpture of a winged dog perched on the roof.
   _Ernie, an adult Lab, bumped his head as he tried to walk into
``Lassie Come Home,'' a junked television console that was turned
into a doghouse by Smart Design Inc.
   To get an idea of how someone could try to pass off an
architectural joke as doghouse, listen to Smart Design's Tom Dair, a
talented designer of products such as toasters and sunglasses.
   ``There was no client, we didn't have to sell it, so we thought
we'd have some fun,'' he admitted. ``We basically decided dogs don't
care where they sleep _ you see them under a tree, in the dirt _ so
it didn't make sense to go into some labor-intensive process.''
   Inspired by the sight of a discarded television cabinet on a
Harlem street corner, Dair and his colleagues bought a similar one
for $40, painted it blue and equipped it with corrugated fiberglass
roof.
   ``What does it sound like when it rains?'' he was asked.
   ``I don't know,'' he shrugged.
   At this point Boris walked by. He glanced at the console with its
rabbit ears antenna (that's a joke, Boris) and made a sound that
sounded like a grunt.
   Fortunately he could not read the designers' explanation:
``Television has become man's best friend _ dependable, lovable and
entertaining.''
   The two most popular houses _ the Dog Cabin and ``Dog House in
the Mayan Style,'' both built with dog biscuits _ are impractical,
because the inhabitants would either eat them or be frustrated by
their inability to do so. The cabin's biscuits are covered with
eight gallons of polyester resin waterproofing.
   The temple contains 400 pounds of dog biscuits. Russ Post kept
Boris on a tight leash and told him, ``We can't have you salivating
every time you walk in front of the Mayan Temple.''
   Each architect was given $1,000 with which to build, but almost
everyone spent far more. Michael MacLeod said he spent his share
just on the dog bones that he stuck in the walls of his Guardian Dog
House.
   Other doghouses seemingly designed more to amuse humans than
shelter animals included a pyramid, ``the Cheops Doghouse''; a
classical temple for ``Fido''; ``Don't Fence Me In,'' which is
entered through a door that looks like a hole in a fence; and the
mythologically inspired ``Trojan Dog,'' built in the shape of a dog.
   At least none of the doghouses looked like a fire hydrant, which
may explain why none of the canine critics resorted to their
ultimate insult.
   The show runs through Oct. 14.

<HEAD>Stalin's Henchmen Tested Poisons, Murder Methods, on Condemned</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Josef Stalin's henchmen used people already
condemned to death to test cloak-and-dagger methods of execution,
including poisoned food or poison-tipped walking sticks, a newspaper
revealed.
   This week's Moscow News also detailed the arrest of Stalin's
secret police chief Lavrenti Beria in 1953, saying the late Soviet
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev strapped on a pistol and helped nab Beria
in the Kremlin.
   The portrait of Brezhnev, who came to power 11 years later, is
surprisingly positive given current criticism that he led the
country to decay until his death in 1982.
   Beria was executed in December 1953, nine months after Stalin
died, by a handful of Soviet officials who feared he would use his
brutal methods to seize power.
   Moscow News produced excerpts from the indictment against Beria,
which alleged he and two underlings were responsible for ``carrying
out experiments on live people.
   ``Seeking methods to use various poisons to carry out secret
murders,'' Beria organized a secret laboratory to carry out
experiments on Soviets who were sentenced to death, the newspaper
said.
   Scientists at the secret laboratory poisoned their victims
``through food, a prick from a walking stick, or injections,'' the
indictment said.
   At least 150 people died that way, the indictment said.
   A few dozen more were poisoned in hideouts in Moscow, Ulyanovsk,
Saratov, the Carpathian region and the Ukraine, the indictment said.
   It quoted a statement from the head of the laboratory, identified
only as Maironovsky, as saying of those he poisoned: ``I don't know
their names, I don't know what they were guilty of.''
   Millions of people were condemned to death for alleged
anti-Soviet activities during the years of Stalin.
   Soviets for years could only whisper among friends about the
repressive era. But many details of the terror have become public
for the first time in the Soviet Union under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness.
   As details emerge, many Soviets increasingly are seeing little
difference between Stalin and Adolf Hitler, whose Nazi Germany has
been characterized here for decades as the epitome of evil.
   Memoirs of Marshal Kirill Moskalenko, who arrested Beria, were
preserved for decades and published by Moscow News.
   He recalled how he was summoned to the Kremlin in June 1953, by
future Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev and asked to lead a band
of men who would arrest Beria at a government meeting.
   They were armed because the secret police chief had his own
well-armed guard.
   Moskalenko said that when asked to choose several trustworthy
officials who could take part in the arrest, he chose Brezhnev, whom
he recalled as a ``brave general, a political worker, dedicated to
the Communist Party and the people.''
   Brezhnev was given a pistol by Defense Minister Nikolai A.
Bulganin, which he carried when the group burst into the meeting
room on a pre-arranged signal to arrest Beria. The secret police
chief did not resist and was executed after lengthy questioning.
   Brezhnev ousted Khrushchev as Soviet leader in 1964 and now is
criticized for permitting what Gorbachev calls a ``period of
stagnation'' to settle over the Soviet Union.

   An Eastern Airlines DC-9 carrying 97 passengers
made an emergency landing Thursday night after the plane blew a tire
while taking off from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, an
official said.
   No injuries were reported. The passengers and the five crew
members were evacuated.
   Eastern Flight 129 headed from Atlanta to Tallahassee, Fla., blew
a tire on the left main landing gear when it took off at about 10
p.m., said John Braden, airport spokesman.
   Braden said the pilot shut down the left engine as a precaution
and landed the aircraft safely at 10:25 p.m.
   A second tire blew upon landing, causing metal to scrape the
runway and send sparks into the wheel well, he said.
   Fire suppressant foam was sprayed in the landing gear as a
precaution, he said.

   A Virgin Islands man charged
with striking Vice President Dan Quayle with a small batch of papers
is an unemployed Vietnam veteran who had been in counseling,
officials said.
   Mwenea Sikuzote, in Washington Wednesday, shouted, ``I have some
documents'' before throwing a roll of papers that hit Quayle on the
head. Quayle was not hurt.
   Sikuzote was charged with assaulting the vice president, a felony
punishable on conviction by up to 10 years in prison or a $10,000
dollar fine or both.
   Mel Vanterpool, director of the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment
Counseling Program, said Sikuzote changed his name from Gilbert
Hendrickson while living in the San Francisco area after returning
from Vietnam in the early 1970s.
   ``He is a very intelligent fellow,'' Vanterpool said Thursday.
``We will be trying our best ... to assist him.'' He indicated that
might include providing a defense lawyer.
   He said Sikuzote, 42, had been unemployed and a regular client at
the center for some time. Acquaintances said Sikuzote had been
worried about his unemployment.
   Police spokesman Lt. Noel Martin said Sikuzote had no criminal
record.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel May Probe Senator's Motivations in Financial Dealings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Senate Ethics Committee
preparing trial-like proceedings against Sen. Dave Durenberger say
they may delve into the motivations behind the Minnesota
Republican's financial dealings.
   Committee Chairman Howell T. Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman
Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H. said Thursday Durenberger could agree in
the case that many facts involving key financial transactions are
not in dispute.
   The committee could then turn to the intent behind those moves,
Rudman and Heflin said at a news conference on procedures for the
hearings, which begin Tuesday and could last two weeks.
   Durenberger already has acknowledged errors in judgment in his
personal finances, but he told constituents last December, ``It was
never my intent to circumvent the Senate rules or circumvent them
for my own benefit.''
   The committee previously announced it found ``substantial
credible evidence'' of financial wrongdoing by Durenberger.
   Some of the allegations cover transactions from 1983 to 1989,
relating to a Minneapolis condominium that Durenberger partly owned
and for which he received Senate reimbursements.
   Other charges are connected to money collected by Durenberger in
promoting two books he wrote and his acceptance of free limousine
rides. These alleged violations took place in 1985 and 1986.
   Heflin said Durenberger's intent is ``one of the elements we'd be
considering. That's an element among many elements.''
   Rudman added Durenberger's motivation also could be considered in
determining whether punishment should be applied.
   Both senators said there has been no plea bargaining that could
result in a settlement before the case runs its course.
   ``We're not in the nature of trading,'' Rudman said.
   Senate rules, however, don't preclude a settlement at any point
in the ethics process that could lead to the full chamber debating
Durenberger's fate.
   A conviction could bring punishment ranging from a mild rebuke to
expulsion, although the Senate's ethics history indicates it would
take a criminal conviction to get expelled.
   Durenberger was elected in 1978 to fill an unexpired term. He won
re-election in 1982 and 1988. His current term expires after 1994.
   Durenberger has spoken little about the case publicly in the last
several weeks, and in an interview Thursday with WCCO-TV in
Minneapolis, he offered no predictions on the outcome of the case.
   ``This is new for me as it is for the committee and for a lot of
you, and I think we'll all get our answers beginning next Tuesday,''
he said.
   When the hearings are completed, special counsel Robert Bennett
will report to the panel, which then would make recommendations to
the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Senate sponsors of an omnibus crime bill with
curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons say odds are better than even
they can save their measure despite their failure to limit debate.
   ``My gut tells me that something will break and we'll end up with
a bill,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said Thursday after
talking with Republicans about a possible compromise.
   The Senate voted 57-37 in favor of limiting debate on the bill to
30 hours, but the tally fell three votes short of the 60 required in
this case.
   Biden, floor manager of the measure, then pronounced the bill
dead, but within an hour he was scrambling to revive it.
   Republicans met to discuss a plan by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
to drop provisions that would in some cases allow courts to consider
evidence gathered with flawed warrants and create an organized crime
and drug division within the Justice Department.
   Thurmond's plan would allow each party to offer 12 amendments but
keeps the rest of the bill intact.
   Democrats later agreed to explore the Republican plan.
   The bill contains remnants of a crime package sent to Congress by
President Bush a year ago but largely rewritten since then. The
administration now has little good to say about the measure.
   Democratic leaders said they needed a limit on debate to push
ahead with floor action on the bill. They pointed to 300 pending
amendments and described them as filibuster fodder.
   They said attempting to debate each of the 300 amendments would
create open-ended delays that would prevent the Senate from voting
on the bill.
   Those favoring curbs on assault weapons blamed pressure from the
National Rifle Association for the failure of efforts to limit
debate. ``It certainly was the major reason,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill.
   But others scoffed at the notion that fear of NRA retaliation at
election time was the reason. ``It wasn't in my case _ I'm leaving
here,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who is retiring at the
end of this year.
   In the days before the vote, the NRA blanketed gun owners in
eight states with mailings criticizing senators who in a vote two
weeks ago supported the bill's gun provisions.
   It said, for example, that Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., ``betrayed
every honest gun owner in South Dakota by voting for it ... because
Daschle bought the big anti-gun media lie that gun control equals
crime control'' and ``has now joined Ted Kennedy and the national
gun ban crowd ....''
   The NRA mailing was identical in other states, with only the
senator's name changed.
   It called on gun owners to contact the senators' state offices
and provided telephone numbers.
   Daschle issued a statement telling South Dakotans that ``as a
hunter and gun owner, I am against gun control, period.''
   ``Let's be realistic,'' he said. ``Taking a couple of very small
steps to try to deal with the drug killers who use these assault
weapons is not going to hurt a single, law-abiding South Dakota
sportsman.''

<HEAD>Iliescu Must Decide: Communism or Democracy?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a bloody revolution, a
contentious election and a damaging earthquake, Romanians now face
the next upheaval in their lives _the move to a market economy.
   Ion Iliescu, the only former Communist popularly elected to lead
an East European nation, has promised to transform Romania's
centralized economy to a free-market system.
   But just how Iliescu carries out this pledge _ slowly or quickly,
superficially or extensively _ will provide the first solid evidence
of whether Romania moves down the road to Western-style democracy or
Soviet-style reform communism.
   Western diplomats, intellectuals and opposition politicians said
the first clue will come later this month when Iliescu announces his
new government. It will reveal whether the economy is still being
run from the top in the old Communist style, they said.
   Muzzled by communism for 44 years, the Romanian people know their
future is at stake.
   Unfamiliar with making points through Western-style political
dialogue, they are still resorting to the shouting, violence and
volatility of December's revolution and the recent election campaign.
   ``The frustrations are now exploding _ it's like a carnival after
a period of fasting,'' said Culture Minister Andrei Plesu, a leading
dissident before December's popular revolt which ended Nicolae
Ceausescu's 24-year dictatorship.
   An anti-Communist protest which has blocked University Square
since April 22 simmers on, despite a threat from the mayor of
Bucharest to clear the thoroughfare. The demonstrators, backed by
about a dozen hunger strikers, are demanding a free press,
independent television, and a ban on ex-Communists like Iliescu
holding public office for 10 years.
   While there are some new faces in high places, many of the old
Communist Party members who ran Ceausescu's government are still in
key posts.
   Ironically, Iliescu's staggering 85 percent landslide and his
National Salvation Front's winning two-thirds of the seats in
Parliament may turn out to be costly victories.
   Iliescu wanted a coalition government to tackle the modernization
of Romania's faltering economy, where production has fallen 30
percent since the revolution. But the opposition parties refused.
   Stelian Tanase, editor of the weekly ``22,'' one of the most
anti-Communist newspapers, said Iliescu now will have to take all
the responsibility for highly unpopular reforms.
   Iliescu also faces competing demands from his own supporters.
   The workers and peasants, the old base of the Communist Party who
provided the bulk of his landslide, voted for stability, a slow
transition to a market economy, and no unemployment.
   But the broad-based Front is split between conservatives who back
the go-slow approach and reformers who want a speedy transition to
capitalism.
   There are other problems as well: unresolved allegations of
electoral fraud and intimidation, ethnic tensions involving the 2.2
million-member Hungarian minority, the drafting of a new
constitution, and preparing for new elections in about two years.
   As if Romanians didn't have enough to worry about, the country
must spend more than $25 million for emergency repairs from an
earthquake last week that killed 14 people and injured 1,000 across
central and Eastern Europe, officials say.
   Predicting two years of terrible complications, Plesu said, ``The
winners are those who are already losing. ... It is not a very
glorious victory.''
   During the election campaign, many Romanians said they didn't
understand what democracy meant.
   A cartoon by Mihai Stanescu, Romania's best-known cartoonist,
shows a man holding a newly painted sign saying ``Democracy'' and
shouting into the telephone: ``Hello, Mr. Bush. Now what am I going
to do with it?''
   A joke currently making the rounds in Bucharest gives some
indication of the lingering distrust of intellectuals for Iliescu, a
onetime Politburo candidate member who fell out with Ceausescu and
took the reins of power when the dictator was toppled.
   In the joke, President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Iliescu are sitting in the back seat of a car. Bush
tells the driver to turn right. Gorbachev tells him to turn left.
Iliescu tells him to head right but turn left.
   In the last days of the campaign, Iliescu said he didn't want to
take undue risks in the transition to a market economy for fear of
creating ``social problems.''
   But Adrian Severin, secretary of state in the Ministry of
National Economy who has emerged as a champion of radical reform,
said the interim government had prepared for a speedy and ``very
deep reform of the economy'' without mass unemployment or soaring
inflation.
   He said he expected the legal and institutional framework for the
transition to a free market to be completed in one year.
   Romania will promote the creation of small and medium-sized
private business, especially in agriculture and tourism, he said in
an interview.
   Within eight months, Severin said, the government expects to turn
state enterprises into autonomous companies which will be subsidized
for several years and then either become independent or be
dismantled if they can't compete.

   In a union dubbed ``Cuomolot,'' two rising
stars from prominent political families will wed this weekend.
   Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and
Andrew Cuomo, oldest son of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, will be the
bride and groom Saturday in a major social event for the political
world.
   ``Everybody in the world knows the Kennedy family,'' said William
Cunningham, a veteran Cuomo political adviser. ``And the Cuomos _ in
New York state, in the political world _ are at the top of the
heap.''
   But Cunningham cautioned against blowing the wedding's importance
out of proportion.
   ``This isn't the Middle Ages where the Duke of Normandy and the
Duke of Avignon get together and decide on a marriage,'' he said.
``This is not a dynastic accomplishment, this is two people who
decided to get married.''
   More than 250 guests have been invited to witness the ceremony
Saturday afternoon in the Cathedral of St. Matthew in Washington,
D.C.
   Rory Kennedy, Kerry's youngest sister, will be maid of honor.
Christopher Cuomo, Andrew's 19-year-old brother, will be best man.
John F. Kennedy Jr., Kerry's cousin and son of the late president,
will be an usher.
   A reception will follow at Hickory Hill, the Kennedy family
estate in suburban McLean, Va.
   The bride, a 30-year-old graduate of Boston College law school,
is the founder and executive director of the Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Center for Human Rights.
   The groom, a 32-year-old lawyer and his father's chief political
adviser, runs HELP, a non-profit corporation he founded to build
temporary housing for the homeless.
   The couple have been dating for more than a year and became
engaged on Valentine's Day this year.
   While both are Roman Catholic, the children of liberal Democrats
and running non-profit social agencies, there are differences.
   Kerry Kennedy grew up in affluence and attended the exclusive
Putney School before heading off for an Ivy League education at
Brown University. Andrew Cuomo, grandson of Italian immigrants who
ran a small grocery store in Queens, attended parochial schools and
then Fordham University in the Bronx.
   Kerry Kennedy is the seventh of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11
children. She was a baby during her uncle's ``Camelot'' presidency,
which the New York Post alluded to by dubbing her marriage
``Cuomolot.''
   She was 8 years old when her father was assassinated in a Los
Angeles hotel the night he won the 1968 California presidential
primary. Another uncle, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, ran
unsuccessfully for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination.
   Andrew Cuomo's father last week announced he'll seek a third term
as governor but left the door open to becoming a potential 1992
Democratic presidential contender.
   In 1980, then-Lt. Gov. Cuomo ran President Carter's New York
primary campaign against Edward Kennedy. Kennedy won in New York.
   Kerry Kennedy came to Albany last week to watch her future
father-in-law announce for re-election. In New York City, meanwhile,
a bachelor party last week for Andrew drew a number of Kennedy
family members and a host of New York's political elite, including
New York City Mayor David Dinkins.
   A highlight of the evening, according to the Post, was a
15-minute videotape that featured friends and acquaintances roasting
Andrew.
   ``He loves to take control so much, he'll end up having the
babies,'' said fellow lawyer Avery Seavey.
   Following a six-day honeymoon in the Caribbean, the couple plans
to settle in Queens.

<TEXT>
   Camouflage pants, T-shirts and combat
boots are out. Straw sun hats, cocktail dresses and manicured nails
are in.
   The new government of President Violetta Barrios de Chamorro is
sending clear signals that gentility is back in style _ no more
Sandinista revolutionary garb, please.
   The first clue came on the night of the inaugural ball at the
former country club.
   The dressed-to-kill crowd of upper-crust Nicaraguans at their old
haunt was something not seen in leftist Nicaragua for more than a
decade.
   ``It's like `The Great Gatsby,''' a South American diplomat said
the morning after the ball.
   He was referring not only to the fine gowns and designer shoes,
but to the refined manners and glittering atmosphere that left some
people gaping.
   ``These are people who either did not live in Nicaragua because
they were in Miami, or they lived (here) during the revolution as if
they were living in Miami,'' said Rosario Murillo, the wife of
former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   Even in diplomatic circles, a relaxed, down-home attitude had
been encouraged by the Sandinistas, themselves generally more at
ease in nicely pressed combat uniforms and in working-class barrios
than in glitzy halls.
   Change is apparent all over Managua.
   The Plaza of the Revolution, where the bourgeoisie used to be
publicly scorned at Sandinista rallies, is now called Plaza of the
Republic _ its pre-Sandinista name.
   Telephone operators now call customers ``Sir'' and ``Madame,''
replacing the egalitarian ``Comrade'' or the laid-back ``Honey'' of
Sandinista times.
   Some things from the old government remain. A boulevard from the
old country club to a shopping plaza retains its name: Ho Chi Minh
Avenue.
   Groups of young, affluent Nicaraguans, fresh from Miami in their
stylish clothes, flock to Salvadoran restaurants where the walls
bear pro-guerrilla posters.
   Men have started wearing coats and ties to important public
functions.
   ``I must admit I am a bit worried about that,'' said a northern
European diplomat.
   ``I had gotten quite used to these clothes,'' he said of his
white cotton guayabera, the Latin American men's shirt of many
pockets worn outside the pants. It satisfied the dressiest dress
code in Sandinista Nicaragua.
   Clothing style under the Sandinistas was dictated by ideology and
economic reality. Few had the money to dress up; those who did were
careful not to offend with clothes that bespoke a fatter pocketbook.
   Ms. Murillo perhaps carried to the extreme the Sandinista
rejection of middle-class conservatism in her usually flamboyant
style of dress.
   Her husband, on the other hand, exemplified the politically
correct dress with his signature camouflage uniforms.
   Ortega changed his image during the election campaign, when he
switched to cotton bomber jackets over black T-shirts and tight
jeans in an effort to woo younger voters to his cause.
   He arrived at Mrs. Chamorro's April 25 inauguration wearing a
red-and-black print cotton shirt and black denim pants, with the
presidential sash in the blue-and-white colors of the Nicaraguan
flag draped over his chest.
   Next to him, Ms. Murillo wore skin-tight jeans, huge earrings and
knee-high riding boots. A baseball cap with a Sandinista campaign
slogan completed her outfit.
   Mrs. Chamorro, a 60-year-old grandmother, wore an elegant white
two-piece suit.
   Ms. Murillo is dismayed by a recent ban on miniskirts at the
government complex.
   ``The miniskirt, long hair'' were revolutionary symbols, Ms.
Murillo said. She called the ban ``attempts against freedom.''
   A young Sandinista woman who kept her job at the Presidential
House despite the change in government said the new clothing
restrictions came as a shock.
   ``We held a meeting and they told us that we couldn't come
wearing sandals or culottes,'' she said, asking her name not be used
for fear of being fired.
   ``They said it was the new image. We asked them if they were
going to raise our salaries.''

   A city ban on thong-backed swimsuits has
prompted a rear-guard action by devotees of the skimpy swimwear.
   A couple of hundred demonstrators rallied Thursday outside City
Hall to protest the ban, including several young women sporting the
swimsuits, which leave the buttocks exposed. No arrests were made.
   Last month, police arrested five people on indecent exposure
charges for wearing the G-string swimsuits at the city's Lido Beach,
touching off a debate at City Hall that led to the May 22 ban. The
council voted Monday to uphold the ban.
   If convicted, the five face up to to 60 days in jail, but no
court hearing has been set.
   ``They can't think of anything else to do,'' said Michele Larsen.
``They have to complain something about us young kids.''
   Others took a different view.
   ``I'm a proud, healthy, virile, 68-year-old Navy veteran of World
War II. Love women,'' said Jack Hoffman. ``I feel this is an onset
to demeaning our whole community.''
   Authorities have not so far attempted to ban the swimsuits in
neighboring Manatee County. Lifeguards there say they have spotted a
handful of the suits on weekdays and about a dozen on weekends.
   ``They don't bother me, as long as I don't have to get into
one,'' said Eleanor Bahr, 69. But her companion, Mary Catney, also
69, said, ``It bothers me; I like to have a little imagination.''
   Cody Elmendorf, 26, vacationing on Coquina Beach from Albany,
N.Y., said that ``from a man's standpoint, I'm in favor of it.''

   Pop-rock supergroup Fleetwood Mac is back
minus one of its creative cogs, singer-guitarist Lindsey Buckingham,
and much of the tension.
   The band recently released ``Behind the Mask,'' its first album
without Buckingham. He departed for a solo career in 1987, saying he
didn't want to tour anymore. He did, however, contribute acoustic
guitar on the title track to ``Behind the Mask.''
   Buckingham was replaced by guitarists Billy Burnette and Rick
Vito. Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie and co-founders John McVie and
Mick Fleetwood are the other group members.
   Fleetwood Mac formed in 1967 as a blues-rock band but
reconstituted in 1975 with the addition of Buckingham and
then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks and churned out a succession of slick
pop hits, such as ``Rhiannon,'' ``Say You Love Me'' and ``Go Your
Own Way.''
   Success fired up tensions in the group. Husband and wife John and
Christine McVie separated and Buckingham and Nicks broke off their
relationship.
   ``Before we knew it, it was really like a soap opera,'' Fleetwood
said.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger was the surprise guest
speaker at the Seaside High School graduation and emphasized the
importance of education and physical fitness.
   When the actor and former Mr. Universe appeared at the podium,
``I think everybody just about swallowed their teeth,'' senior
Brandy Bierly said. Bierly then gave the senior speech to the class
of 90 teen-agers.
   ``Mr. Schwarzenegger was a very tough act to follow,'' he said.
   Afterwards Schwarzenegger shook hands with students and kissed
some of the girls.
   Schwarzenegger is filming his new movie, ``Kindergarten Cop,'' in
Clatsop County. His appearance was the handiwork of Jamie Burns, a
junior whose mother is an extra in ``Kindergarten Cop.''
   Burns said she tracked down Schwarzenegger through the film's
director, Ivan Reitman, and then persuaded her principal to approve
the guest speech.

   Entertainer Roger Miller says black blues
guitarists and fiddlers were an important influence on white country
musicians in the 1920s.
   ``I think we need to give black people more credit for their role
in country music,'' said Miller, who gained fame with his hit ``King
of the Road'' in the 1960s.
   Now a hint of rock 'n' roll can be found in today's country
music, he said.
   ``Country people used to be people who played music on the
farms,'' Miller said. ``Now you've got younger listeners. The first
rock 'n' rollers later went into country music and now you're
hearing a rock influence.''
   Miller, who composed the music for the Broadway production ``Big
River,'' is heading back to the New York stage. He's currently
working on a musical version of ``Shane,'' based on the Jack
Schaefer novel, which was also the basis for the 1953 movie starring
Alan Ladd.
   ``We're gonna put some cowboys on stage and see how the New
Yorkers react,'' said Miller, who starts a four-day engagement
Wednesday at the Roy Clark Celebrity Theater in this Ozarks tourist
community.

took a few lessons on the fortunes of politics when he met with
Greek Premier Constantine Mitsotakis.
   ``This is a visit we will treasure,'' Dukakis, a Greek-American,
said Thursday.
   Mitsotakis, who called the governor a ``personal friend,'' tried

   ``Yes, it is true politics have ups and downs,'' Mitsotakis said

<HEAD>Increased Cancer Deaths Found in Wives, Children of Asbestos
Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wives and children of asbestos workers are
dying of cancer at 1{ times the rate of the general population, and
their only exposure to asbestos was the dust on the clothes of their
husbands and fathers, a study shows.
   ``This finding of elevations in cancers really concerns us,''
said the author of the study, Lou Joubert of the American Cancer
Society.
   The study was described Thrusday at a conference on the hazards
associated with asbestos in place in schools and other public
buildings.
   In other studies, alarmingly high levels of lung damage were
found in construction workers who don't work directly with asbestos.
Many previous studies have found elevated disease and death rates
among workers who produced asbestos or worked with it. The new
studies find that asbestos is deadly even for construction workers
who do not use it in their jobs.
   High levels of asbestos-related cancer were also found in school
custodians in three separate studies, suggesting that the asbestos
hazard in schools is greater than anticipated, said Dr. Philip J.
Landrigan of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
Landrigan was one of the conference's organizers.
   ``The hazard of asbestos in place is more than we anticipated,''
Landrigan said.
   Jacques Dunnigan of The Asbestos Institute, which represents the
interests of Canadian asbestos mines, argued that Canadian asbestos,
called chrysotile asbestos, is less dangerous than other forms.
Asked about the reports at the conference, he said, ``It's very,
very poor science that I'm listening to.''
   Asbestos-related diseases _ lung cancer, a lung-scarring called
asbestosis and a cancer of the lung lining called mesothelioma _
occur 20 to 30 years after exposure to asbestos.
   Asbestos was widely used as insulation in schools and other
buildings during the construction boom of the 1950s and 1960s, and
so asbestos-related diseases are just beginning to appear.
   These diseases now cause about 10,000 deaths per year, said Dr.
Stephen M. Levin, also of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
   Joubert studied 878 children and wives of men who worked at a
now-closed asbestos plant in Paterson, N.J. Of the 115 that have
died, 38 percent died of cancer, compared with an expected death
rate of 20 percent to 25 percent in the general population.
   Dr. Laura Welch of George Washington University in Washington
found that 40 percent of sheet metal workers _ who do not use
asbestos in their work _ had asbestos-related lung damage, a
precursor of asbestosis or cancer. They were exposed to asbestos on
construction sites, Welch said.
   Landrigan found the same asbestos-related lung damage in
firefighters with at least 20 years of service. Their rate of lung
damage was seven times that of the general population. The
firefighters are typically exposed to asbestos when they enter
buildings after fires have been put out, he said.
   Levin reported the results of a study in which he and his
colleagues examined 660 New York City school custodians 20 years
after any possible exposure to asbestos. The researchers found that
28 percent of the custodians had asbestos-related lung damage.
   ``It was somewhat surprising,'' he said. ``We knew exposure
occurred, but while we expected to see some disease, the rates
surprised us.'' Similar findings were reported from independent
studies in Los Angeles and Boston, Levin said.
   An article in Science magazine in January argued that asbestos in
schools and other buildings was not a significant hazard.
   Scientists at the New York conference were sharply critical of
that article, which they said was already causing some building
owners and regulatory agencies to be less diligent in containing or
removing asbestos.

   Columbia's astronomy mission with the
$150 million Astro observatory is off until August because of a
hydrogen leak, making Atlantis the next shuttle to fly, NASA says.
   Atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret military payload into
orbit in mid-July.
   ``I do not have any problem at all moving Atlantis out and
preparing it for its next flight,'' shuttle director Robert L.
Crippen said Thursday. ``I think we've got a situation that is safe
to go fly, and if we do not we will have evidence of that that will
be very clear to us.''
   Columbia's upcoming flights will be pushed back ``in an orderly
fashion,'' Crippen said. A scientific research mission scheduled for
August is now set for December, pushing Columbia's December mission
with a microgravity laboratory into next year.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will move
Columbia from the launch pad back to the hangar next week so the
hydrogen leak can be repaired. The leak was detected as more than a
half-million gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen
were being pumped into the shuttle for last week's launch attempt.
   ``All of the checks and balances that we had in place worked just
like they were supposed to work. We were never in an unsafe
condition,'' Crippen said.
   A test Wednesday confirmed NASA's suspicion the leak is in or
near a tight cavity between two metal plates that connect the
orbiter and external tank. The orbiter and tank will have to be
disconnected, a job that can be performed only at the hangar.
   Crippen said pipes and valves probably will have to be replaced
in that area and another external tank used. He declined to estimate
how much the repairs will cost and how much the delay already has
cost.
   ``The problem we're dealing with is unique. We've never seen it
before,'' he said.
   ``Until we pull it apart and do some detailed trouble-shooting on
it we'll be unable to say specifically what the problem is.''
   Crippen said the delay poses no risk to the Astro observatory,
which consists of three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray
telescope capable of examining some of the hottest objects in the
universe.
   ``It just has to sit on the ground for longer than we had
desired,'' he said.
   The Astro mission, the first in five years dedicated entirely to
scientific research, already was two weeks late because of cooling
system repairs. The mission originally was scheduled for 1986, but
was delayed by the Challenger explosion.
   Discovery's flight in April with the Hubble Space Telescope was
two weeks late because of a malfunctioning power unit that had to be
replaced at the launch pad.
   Crippen said mechanical problems are to be expected now and then.
   ``Flying the space shuttle is not like operating an airline and
it never will be,'' he said. ``It is a very complex vehicle ... that
is going to have problems show up periodically and yet it does offer
us a way to get large payloads into space on a fairly frequent
basis.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that U.S. courts have
jurisdiction over the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton made the finding Thursday in
deciding to let stand lawsuits against the PLO stemming from the
October 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship.
   The litigation included two lawsuits by passengers as well as
claims by travel agencies that were sued by the estate of Leon
Klinghoffer, the 69-year-old American who was shot to death in his
wheelchair aboard the ship and thrown into the Mediterranean Sea.
   The complaints allege the PLO was responsible for the highjacking
and seek to hold the organization liable for damages.
   The PLO sought dismissals on the grounds of diplomatic immunity
and lack of jurisdiction. It denied any involvement and said its
chairman, Yasser Arafat, mediated a peaceful resolution to the
hijacking.
   The PLO's attorney, Ramsey Clark, said he would appeal the
decision.
   ``I do not believe the United States courts have jurisdiction
over the PLO,'' Clark, a former U.S. attorney general, said.
   The hijackers released the ship in Egypt in exchange for safe
passage to Tunisia, but their plane was forced down in Sicily by the
United States. A man directing the hijackers from shore was released
but four others were held by Italy and subsequently sentenced to
prison on weapons charges.
   Stanton rejected several of the PLO's arguments, including that
the issue of its liability for a terrorist attack was a foreign
policy question not appropriately decided in the courts.
   ``The seizure of a ship on the high seas poses no value judgments
or debatable issues of the law of nations,'' Stanton wrote. ``Acts
of piracy are clear violations of international law.''
   Stanton ruled the PLO had no immunity from this litigation
because of its status as an observer at the United Nations.
   ``Any acts for which the PLO could be held responsible in these
cases did not occur in connection with its observer function,'' he
said.
   The judge also settled jurisdictional questions by ruling that
the PLO did business in Manhattan at its United Nations mission and
therefore could be sued in New York.
   ``The PLO has purposefully established a permanent and extensive
presence in New York,'' Stanton said. ``While the United States
strictly limits PLO's activities, it still has constant and
substantial contacts here.''
   Stanton also ruled that the PLO was properly served with the
complaints.
   The Klinghoffer lawsuit in federal court claims the owner and
charterer of the Achille Lauro and travel agencies did not take
sufficient steps to prevent a hijacking or warn passengers of the
possibility.
   Jay D. Fischer, the Klinghoffer attorney, said the estate also
has a lawsuit pending in state court alleging that the PLO was
responsible for Klinghoffer's death.
   ``This decision vindicates the view of the Klinghoffer family
that the U.S. courts constitute the appropriate forum for the
determination of legal liability for the murder of Leon Klinghoffer
aboard the Achille Lauro,'' Fischer said.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk's
lifting of the 4-year-old state of emergency met with some criticism
on both sides here, with blacks calling it a ``half measure'' and
right-wing whites warning the president he had gone too far.
   De Klerk's action Thursday, an effort to pave the way for
black-white negotiations on dismantling apartheid, ended some of the
harshest political restrictions ever imposed by the country's white
rulers.
   ``The net result of the lifting of the state of emergency is that
one of the main stumbling blocks (to constitutional negotiations)
has been removed,'' de Klerk told Parliament in Cape Town.
   In Paris, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela called
the development ``a victory for the people,'' but he said he would
continue to urge Western governments to maintain economic sanctions
against Pretoria.
   He also criticized the retention of the state of emergency in
Natal Province. De Klerk said that province will remain under
emergency rule because violence there ``cannot be countered with the
ordinary laws of the land.''
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu said the state of emergency had done
nothing to stop the fighting in Natal, where about 4,000 blacks have
died in the past four years. The main combatants are supporters of
the ANC and members of Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu
organization.
   ``We are not asking for half measures,'' Sisulu told a news
conference. ``What we have asked for is to clear the atmosphere to
negotiations. That was not done.''
   The ANC has said the lifting of the emergency, the release of
political prisoners and the return of exiles are the main obstacles
to full negotiations.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, meanwhile, said the end of
the state of emergency would lead to chaos and further alienate
right-wing whites disgruntled with de Klerk's reforms.
   ``He no longer speaks for the (white) people he claims to
represent,'' said Clive Derby-Lewis, a Conservative spokesman.
   But business groups and world leaders heaped praise on de Klerk.
   The White House called the lifting of the emergency a sign of
``the remarkable progress'' in recent months in South Africa, and
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said it was a
``positive development.''
   During the state of emergency, more than 30,000 activists, most
of them black, were detained without charge for varying lengths of
time. Thousands more went into hiding after former President P.W.
Botha imposed the restrictions on June 12, 1986.
   About 300 activists were being held under the emergency
regulations as of Thursday, most of them in Natal.
   In announcing the end of the state of emergency, de Klerk also
held out the prospect for other reforms.
   He said the government was considering changes to security laws
that ``could possibly inhibit the free conduct of peaceful
politics'' and said he was taking unspecified actions that would
allow thousands of exiles to return home.
   The ANC says it has more than 15,000 exiled members.
   De Klerk also said that as a ``good will gesture'' he would
release 48 prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes. The
ANC has said there are some 3,500 inmates it considers political
prisoners.
   De Klerk wants to work out a new constitution with opposition
groups that will lead to power-sharing between the 5 million whites
and 28 million blacks, who under apartheid have no voice in national
affairs.
   Mid-level officials from the ANC and the government worked out a
joint program on the obstacles to negotiations last month and
submitted the plan to the leaders on both sides.
   De Klerk said the government has accepted the plan and is ready
to implement it, but the ANC has asked to delay its response until
July 10. Details of the plan have not been released.
   The president challenged Mandela to stop advocating guerrilla
violence. He criticized Mandela's recent statement that the ANC
approves of ``organized, disciplined violence'' against chosen
targets.
   The end of the emergency is likely to make it more difficult for
Mandela to persuade foreign governments to maintain economic
sanctions against Pretoria.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, who met Mandela in Paris
Thursday, met de Klerk last month and indicated he would be willing
to call for a reassessment of European Community sanctions if the
emergency were lifted, political prisoners were released and exiles
were allowed to return.
   More than 20 opposition groups were banned and several
anti-apartheid newspapers were shut down temporarily during the
emergency. Police repeatedly raided black trade union offices and
broke up political meetings and demonstrations in black townships
and university campuses.
   De Klerk in February nullified some of the restrictions as part
of his reforms.
   Many of the emergency regulations are duplicated in existing
security laws. But the emergency decree allowed the government and
police to bypass the courts.
   Existing laws allow for detention without trial, provide
authority to ban political meetings and permit the government to
place restrictions on activists such as house arrest.

<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association opens its
annual convention today with some of its supporters puzzled why a
group known for its clout is suffering legislative defeats and a
sharp loss in membership.
   ``I think there's a great deal of frustration among the
membership based on a very tough year,'' said James J. Baker,
lobbyist for the 2.8 million-member gun lobby based in Washington,
D.C.
   Once renowned for its political influence throughout the nation,
the NRA has recently suffered legislative defeats in New Jersey,
Maryland and Florida.
   An estimated 20,000 members will attend the convention in
California, which last year passed legislation banning more than 50
types of military-style assault rifles.
   On Thursday, the gun lobby scored a tenuous victory when U.S.
Senate supporters of a wide-ranging crime bill with curbs on
semiautomatic assault weapons failed to stop a filibuster.
   Democratic leaders, blaming pressure from the NRA for the failure
of efforts to limit debate, initially decided the bill was dead,
then sought a compromise to revive the measure.
   The convention comes at a crucial time in the history of the NRA.
Along with legislative defeats, the group has lost support among law
enforcement and dropped an estimated 250,000 members in four years.
   Baker blames the falloff in membership on a $10 dues increase and
unknown factors, but gun control advocates see a badly damaged
organization.
   ``Over the last 12 months you're looking at the worst period in
the NRA's existence,'' said Luis Tolley, western director of Handgun
Control Inc.
   Among the events on the convention agenda is a membership meeting
Saturday when the rank and file can question NRA leaders on
legislative losses.
   California's clampdown on assault weapons came after five
children were slain and 29 others were wounded in a schoolyard by a
man with an assault rifle. The man, Patrick Purdy, killed himself at
the end of the Jan. 17, 1989, attack in Stockton.
   California also now requires a 15-day waiting period for the
purchase of rifles and shotguns.
   Elsewhere, Maryland voters approved a referendum in 1988 that
bans the sale and manufacture of cheap handguns known as Saturday
Night Specials.
   In New Jersey earlier this year, Gov. James Florio signed what he
called the nation's strongest ban on the sale and possession of
assault weapons.
   But Baker asserts that despite those setbacks, the NRA retains
influence, using as an example the extension of the crime bill
filibuster. The NRA had sent messages from Executive Director Wayne
LaPierre to gun owners in eight states urging them to pressure their
senators.
   ``We've lost some battles,'' Baker said Thursday. ``The war is
far from over. You look at the votes in the United States Senate
this morning and I think that gives you the proof that you need.''
   Robert Ellison, helping to set up a convention booth for Sierra
Bullets, blamed the NRA's troubles on widespread misunderstanding of
gun issues, rather than on the organization's internal shortcomings.
   ``They do a good job and work in the best interest of members,''
he said. ``But the general public, quite frankly, isn't getting the
right message.''

<HEAD>Panel Votes to Slash Request to Rebuild Bugged Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A unanimous Senate Foreign Relations Committee
wants to slash by 80 percent President Bush's request for money to
tear down and rebuild a new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow riddled
with electronic bugs.
   A 15-0 vote by the panel on Thursday demonstrated anew that there
is no consensus among policy makers about what to do with the
eight-story white elephant.
   In a drafting session called to deal with Bush's request for
additional money for the embassy and to pay past-due U.S. fees to
the United Nations, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan called it
``humiliating and wasteful'' to tear down a nearly completed
building that already has cost $60 million.
   Moynihan, D-N.Y., proposed instead to cut the State Department
embassy request for $270 million in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1
to $50 million.
   He said that would be enough to finish the current office
building, which could be used for non-classified activities, and to
construct a secure ``bubble'' elsewhere in the embassy compound for
sensitive intelligence and diplomatic activities.
   During a brief discussion of Moynihan's amendment there was no
dissent except from a State Department representative, who said the
administration would strenuously oppose the move because it would
compromise security at the site.
   The administration wants to dismantle the building down to its
foundation, which would be left in place. A new structure then would
be built after a ``buffer'' layer is installed to insulate the new
building from the foundation.
   The structure would then be put to its originally planned use as
the primary office building for the complex. Intelligence experts,
including the Senate Intelligence Committee, have endorsed that
approach as the only secure one.
   A similar bill awaiting House action includes the full $270
million asked by the administration but defers the question of
whether to raze and rebuild the office building until after
negotiations are completed on purchase of additional land adjacent
to the embassy compound.
   A House Foreign Affairs Committee staff report concluded that it
is ``unnecessary and unwise'' to tear down the building because it
could be put to use as staff housing, which is in short supply in
Moscow.
   It is unclear whether the legislation approved Thursday by the
Senate panel will ever be enacted. Few major foreign affairs bills
have survived the full legislative process in recent years.
   Work on the embassy building was halted in August 1985 after it
was discovered that the structure had been permeated with Soviet
listening devices. Sources have said the United States still does
not fully understand the technology used by Soviet spies to turn the
building into a giant microphone.
   At least three outside consultants have done lengthy studies of
what to do with the building, and numerous internal State Department
and congressional studies have been performed. More than a dozen
different solutions to the problem have been considered.

   America's mightiest unmanned space
rocket, a Titan 4, blasted off today with a secret military payload.
   It was the second launch of a Titan 4. The giant rocket boosted a
missile-warning satellite into orbit in June 1989.
   The rocket was launched at 1:22 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station, lighting up the sky as it thundered toward orbit.
   The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight
until about 20 minutes later, when a statement was issued. The
payload was not disclosed.
   ``This was an important launch for America's space program,''
said Martin C. Faga, the Air Force's assistant secretary for space.
``The Titan 4 is the largest booster ever launched by the Air Force.
... The Titan 4 provides our nation a vital path to space for
critical national security payloads.''
   John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists'
space policy project, said the rocket's cargo probably is a $500
million electronic eavesdropping satellite capable of intercepting
missile telemetry and radio communications.
   A less likely possibility, Pike said, is that it is a
missile-warning satellite.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1 billion contract
with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for
eight more. The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its
dependency on NASA's manned space shuttle.
   The shuttle is the most powerful cargo carrier used by the United
States, capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. The
Titan 4, an expendable launch vehicle, can lift a 39,000-pound
payload into low Earth orbit or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary
orbit 22,300 miles high.
   The Titan 4 stands 20 stories tall and is powered by two liquid
fuel main engines and two solid rocket boosters. One of the engine's
nozzles malfunctioned in last year's launch, but the other nozzle
compensated and the rocket remained on target.
   The Air Force plans to launch future Titan 4 rockets from Cape
Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
   Ten Titan 4 rockets originally were to have been launched by
October. The U.S. General Accounting Office criticized the program
in a report last month, citing schedule delays and $209 million in
cost overruns as of July 1989.
   Martin Marietta said it is working to improve production and cut
costs.
   The Denver company encountered problems with a commercial Titan 3
launch in March. An engineering design error caused the rocket's
cargo, an Intelsat communications satellite, to be placed in a
uselessly low orbit.
   Intelsat's board of governors will decide at a meeting in
Barbados this week and next whether to pay the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for a shuttle rescue mission, which could
exceed $130 million. The Washington-based consortium of 119
countries operates a global communications system.
   A commercial Titan 3 is scheduled to carry another Intelsat
communications satellite into orbit on June 21.

   A brief glance at the main issues
in the Czechoslovak elections today:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WHAT'S AT STAKE: 300 seats in the two-chamber federal parliament,
200 seats in the regional parliament of the Czech republic and 150
seats in the regional parliament of the smaller Slovak republic.
   The two republics have control over significant areas of public
life, including education, culture and health care.
   The federal parliament controls foreign affairs, defense, finance
and the environment. It also has to elect a new president, virtually
certain to be the incumbent, Vaclav Havel, after he appoints a new
federal government based on the results of the election.
   The chief task of the new federal parliament, which like the
regional parliaments will sit only for two years, is to draft a new
Czechoslovak constitution.
   This should remove the vestiges of four decades of Communist rule
and will have to deal with rising separatist sentiment in the Slovak
republic, where many people seek the eventual creation of a separate
Slovak state that could enter a new united Europe.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES: There are 22 parties competing in the
elections, although some are standing only in the Czech or Slovak
republics.
   The heavy favorites to emerge as strongest forces are the Civic
Forum and its Slovak partner organization, Public Against Violence,
who led last winter's peaceful revolution against Communist rule.
   Latest opinion polls give them 39 to 42 percent of the vote
nationwide. The second strongest force is the Christian Democratic
alliance of three parties: the People's Party and Christian
Democrats in the Czech republic, and the Christian Democrat movement
in Slovakia.
   The third strongest is the Communist party, which is given around
10 percent in the latest pre-election polls.
   Other parties likely to get the 5 percent minimum vote required
for seats in federal or regional bodies are the environmentalist
Greens and the Social Democrats.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   HOW VOTING WORKS: About 11.2 million people 18 and over are
entitled to vote. They will cast ballots for lists of candidates in
12 electoral regions nationwide. Seats will be allotted on a
proportional basis.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MAIN ISSUES: All parties support the transition to a market
economy. A key issue will be the future status of Slovakia. Under
the current federation created by the Communists in 1968, Slovakia
is allotted half the federal funds, although it has only about
one-third of Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million citizens.

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he really likes the White
House because ``they've got good food there'' even if the job
entails reading ``tons of paper.''
   The president reflected on his life as the nation's chief
executive Thursday in a discussion with kindergarten through
third-grade students at Chicago's Farnsworth Elementary School.
   He first discussed education and the war on drugs with a group of
area principals and then read to a group of young students in
observance of National Literacy Week.
   ``You really like it or are you just saying that?'' Bush asked
his young audience, who clapped after he read from a children's book
_ something that his wife Barbara does frequently in her efforts to
promote literacy.
   He told the kids to go home and tell their parents and
grandparents to read to them more.
   ``If you want to be president, learn to read and try to keep
going in the right direction,'' Bush said.
   But, he said, ``there's tons of papers, just endless numbers of
papers to read ... . I read so many I sometimes start reading
backwards, which is very bad to do, because you don't understand it
very well.''
   Bush asked the students if they saw news accounts of ``the man
from Russia,'' referring to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
recent visit to the United States. ``You do things like that,'' he
said. ``And you work with Congress.''
   ``I like it a lot. They've got good food there,'' Bush said of
life in the White House.
   ``It's fulltime work. It's very interesting. It's very important.
You work with important people in the White House,'' Bush said.
   But ``it's not all hard work,'' he added, noting that he and Mrs.
Bush like to walk their pet spaniel, Millie, around the grounds
after he finishes work in the Oval Office each evening.
   One child asked how many rooms were in the White House. ``That's
a good question,'' Bush said, clearly stumped.
   He said he guessed there were about 10 bedrooms, ``maybe even
more.''
   He said his favorite room in the White House was the Oval Office,
because it is ``so special and so beautiful.'' He also said he liked
the Lincoln bedroom, because it is where Lincoln signed the
Emancipation Proclamation and ``freed all the slaves.''

<HEAD>Euthanasia Advocates Say Death Machine Raises Few New Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suicide machine used by an
Oregon woman to end her life has raised no new ethical questions in
the Netherlands, where euthanasia is widely accepted, advocates of
mercy killing say.
   ``There is no ethical or legal difference in the Netherlands
between direct (euthanasia) action by a doctor or a doctor simply
providing the means'' to commit suicide, Theo van Berkesteijn,
chairman of the Royal Netherlands Physicians' Association, said in a
telephone interview.
   Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore. died Monday after using the
suicide machine designed by Dr. Jack Kevorkian of Michigan. She had
been told she was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
   The subject was discussed informally Thursday as a 21-nation
euthanasia conference opened in the Netherlands. Formal discussion
is expected today.
   Kevorkian's device has sparked a debate among American legal and
medical authorities on whether it is legal and ethical for doctors
to assist their patients in committing suicide. Medical regulators
have joined prosecutors in investigating Kevorkian.
   But in the Netherlands, it has become widely accepted for
physicians to go even further and personally administer lethal
injections to terminally ill or suffering patients who have asked to
die.
   The physicians' association has spearheaded a 15-year campaign
for full legalization of euthanasia on the grounds that mercy
killing can be a humane medical practice and should not have to take
place surreptitiously.
   Kevorkian's machine is ``a technical innovation which brings no
new ethical elements,'' said Pit Bakker, chairwoman of the Dutch
Voluntary Euthanasia Society.
   The eighth World Conference of Right-to-Die Societies opened in
the southern Dutch city of Maastricht on Thursday to discuss legal
and ethical issues surrounding euthanasia.
   Derek Humphry, the British executive director of the Hemlock
Society, a U.S. right-to-die advocacy group, described Kevorkian as
``a very brave pioneer who is trying to shock the medical profession
into accepting voluntary euthanasia.''
   But he said that ``We don't think that dying in the back of a
van, 2,000 miles from home, is a dignified death.''
   Mrs. Adkins, 54, traveled from Oregon to Michigan because the
state has no clear laws on doctor-assisted suicide, according to
Humphry. Kevorkian drove with Mrs. Adkins to a park outside Detroit
and attached her to the electric-powered suicide device in the back
of his van. She pressed a button that delivered chemicals that
stopped her heart, and Kevorkian said she was dead within minutes.
   ``We accept this is what Mrs. Adkins wanted, because of the
terrible (euthanasia) law in America,'' Humphry said.
   Although euthanasia is still technically a crime punishable by a
12-year prison term here, physicians are rarely prosecuted as long
as they follow a set of semi-official guidelines that have received
the tacit support of the government.
   Under the guidelines established by the physicians' association,
doctors must make sure the patient has explictly asked to die and
that relatives and other physicians are consulted before euthanasia
is carried out.
   Berkesteijn noted that the Adkins case raised the issue of
whether informed consent could be obtained from a patient suffering
from Alzheimer's disease, an incurable disease that leads to
deterioration of the brain.
   ``Euthanasia in the Netherlands is and should remain a case where
patients are fully lucid'' when they seek death, he said.
   Last year, a government euthanasia proposal was shelved
indefinitely after the center-right coalition government of Premier
Ruud Lubbers collapsed over an unrelated issue.
   The proposal was a compromise between the pro-euthanasia Liberal
Party, right-wingers on most other issues, and Lubbers' Christian
Democrats.
   The Dutch Christian Democrats, an amalgam of religious-based
political parties, take pains to avoid antagonizing the conservative
Roman Catholic and Protestant communities.
   Lubbers wanted to avoid legalization but give government
recognition to the status quo by codifying the existing guidelines.
   His current center-left coalition has ordered an investigation to
determine the volume of euthanasia cases and their circumstances, a
move criticized by advocates as yet more political waffling on what
has already become widespread practice.
   Estimates of the number of right-to-die cases vary from a few
hundred to 20,000 a year in this nation of 14.6 million, although
experts stress thee are no reliable figures.
   Attending the conference are experts from Australia, Belgium,
Great Britain, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, the Netherlands,
Greece, India, Israel, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, South Africa, West Germany and the United States.

<HEAD>Rain Forest Destroyed At Faster Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The world's rain forests are being destroyed
faster than previously thought, an environmental research group says.
   ``Every year the world loses an area of tropical forests almost
as big as the state of Washington,'' said James Gustave Speth,
president of World Resources Institute.
   The report, released Thursday by the institute, said data from
satellites and ground sensors, along with reports from individual
governments, indicate tropical forests are vanishing 50 percent
faster than previously estimated.
   The report, citing 1987 data, concluded that 40 million to 50
million acres of tropical forests are stripped each year, compared
to the official estimate of about 28 million acres _ based on 1980
data _ that still is used by the United Nations and many governments.
   Deforestation is a major concern to scientists and
environmentalists because tropical forests absorb carbon dioxide
and, therefore, serve as a carbon ``sink'' for the manmade gas,
which contributes to global warming. As forests disappear, more
carbon dioxide is allowed free to drift into the atmosphere, where
it and other manmade pollutants act much like a greenhouse and cause
the earth to warm.
   Some scientists believe such warming, if not checked, will cause
severe changes in weather patterns, coastal flooding and economic
disruptions by the middle of the next century.
   Allen Hammond, who headed the institute's research effort, said
the satellite findings and data from studies in several countries
with vast tropical forests provide the first exhaustive look at the
current extent of deforestation worldwide.
   But other recent indications show that the official estimate of
rain-forest destruction, based on data a decade old, was far too
conservative. A study by a British scientists last year came to a
conclusion similar to the institute's findings.
   Ken Andrasko, senior forestry analyst for the climate change
office of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the ``definitive
answer to how much forest we're losing'' won't be available until
next year when the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization revises
its rain forest destruction estimates.
   Andrasko said indications are that the updated estimates will
reflect findings similar to the Institute's report.
   Meanwhile, official estimates on the extent of the deforestation
problem continue to be based on the 1980 data. For example, the EPA
used the official data in drafting a policy options paper on global
warming last year.
   ``We're talking about sparse (official) data that is credible,''
Hammond said. He said he considers the institute's findings
conservative.
   According to the World Resources Institute report, about
one-third of carbon dioxide pollution each year comes from the
destruction of tropical rain forests. An additional 2.8 billion tons
of carbon were released into the atmosphere in 1987 because of
tropical deforestation, the study said.
   The report is based on data gathered in 1987 when deforestation
in Brazil, which has the world's largest rain forest, was at its
peak. As much as 20 million acres of forest may have been destroyed
in Brazil that year, the study said.
   The Brazilian government has since begun to curb deforestation,
but Hammond said the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest
continues at a significant rate and deforestation elsewhere is
increasing.
   According to the 1987 data gathered in the institute's study, 11
countries were responsible for 82 percent of the world's tropical
deforestation: Brazil, Indonesia, Burma, India, Colombia, Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Laos, Philippines, Nigeria and Vietnam.
   Satellite sensing studies showed deforestation in India at 3.7
million acres in 1987, 10 times the earlier estimate, the study
said. Large areas of India legally still designated as forest land
``already are virtually treeless according to the satellite
imagery,'' said the researchers.
   Burma, which was not among the top 10 countries in deforestation
a decade ago, now ranks near the top with 1.7 million acres of
forests lost annually, a 500 percent increase over 1980.
   As a result of deforestation, Brazil in 1987 caused 1.2 million
tons of carbon to be released, about the same amount of carbon
released by the United States from the burning of fossil fuels that
year, the study said.

<HEAD>Economists Say Johnson Resignation Won't Affect Interest Rates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The departure of Federal Reserve Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson will have little immediate effect on interest rates,
economists say, but it will give President Bush another chance to
put his stamp on the central bank.
   Johnson, 41, unexpectedly announced Thursday he will resign from
the No. 2 job at the central bank on Aug. 3 to return to an academic
career.
   Bush, who has been pressing the Fed to relent and let interest
rates fall to keep the country out of a recession, will get his
third chance to appoint someone to the seven-member Fed board.
   Earlier this year, Bush appointed David Mullins, a top aide to
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and reappointed Edward W. Kelley
Jr., originally appointed by President Reagan.
   Early speculation pointed to Wendy Gramm, chairman of the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission, as a likely nominee to
succeed Johnson.
   But economists said the changes on the board would not chance the
Fed's current tight-money policies.
   Despite administration complaints, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and his colleagues have been keeping interest rates high
to dampen economic demand and reduce inflationary pressures.
   This ``soft-landing'' approach appears to be working. Economic
growth has slowed but the economy has not dipped into a recession.
   Lyle Gramley, a former Fed board member and now chief economist
for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said Fed policy-makers,
including Johnson, had been supporting Greenspan's approach.
   ``The bulk of policy-making officials are committed to bringing
down inflation through a process that involves slow growth,'' he
said. ``The Fed isn't closely divided now where one vote in either
direction would make much of a difference.''
   A published report in March quoted an anonymous Bush adviser as
saying the president was ``mad as hell'' at Greenspan and predicting
he would not reappoint the chairman when his term expires next year.
   Bush later denied the report, but left no doubt he would prefer
to see lower interest rates.
   Johnson had been considered one of the leading candidates for the
chairman's job should Bush decide to fire Greenspan. But Thursday,
Johnson said he fully supported Greenspan's reappointment in 1991
and would decline any offer to succeed him at that time.
   Gramm, the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has opposed an
administration effort on Capitol Hill to transfer the CFTC's control
over stock index futures to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Her appointment to the Fed would remove her from that debate.
   Others mentioned as possible candidates for a Fed appointment
were John Taylor, a member of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, and Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber.
   ``The administration is likely to choose some one out of the same
mold as Mullins, a pro-administration Republican with an academic
background,'' said David Jones, author of a book on the Federal
Reserve and chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   Johnson said he was leaving because he wished to return to the
private sector.
   ``The main reason I decided to step down is that I have spent 10
consecutive years in public service,'' he said. ``Ten years is long
enough to serve in positions in government.''
   Johnson was appointed to the Fed by President Reagan on Feb. 7,
1986, and was elevated to vice chairman six months later.
   Johnson said he planned to return to George Mason University in
Washington's Virginia suburbs and assume the Koch Chair in
international economics and become director of the Center for Global
Market Studies.
   He was a professor at the school in 1981 when he was selected to
join the economics team in Reagan's first term.

<HEAD>Defense Seeks No Prison Term for Poindexter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for John M. Poindexter are asking the
judge to reject a prosecution request to send the former national
security adviser to prison.
   Defense attorney Richard W. Beckler argued in court papers filed
Thursday that imprisoning Poindexter for lying about the Iran-Contra
affair would only unjustly extend ``the suffering he has endured''
for 3{ years.
   Poindexter, convicted of five felony counts stemming from efforts
to conceal details of the Iran-Contra affair from Congress, is
scheduled to be sentenced Monday.
   The retired Navy rear admiral, who served as President Reagan's
national security adviser from 1985 until his resignation when the
affair became public in late 1986, could be sentenced up to 25 years
in prison and fined $1.25 million.
   But the defense urged U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene to
reject a request by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh that he
order Poindexter to serve a prison sentence for lying to Congress.
   ``This recommendation was made without the slightest reference to
John Poindexter's lifelong career of service to his country and to
his community,'' Beckler said of the retired Navy rear admiral.
   ``It is made without consideration of the heavy punishment that
the more than three-year `Iran-Contra' investigation has already
visited upon John Poindexter and his family,'' the lawyer wrote.
   ``To take him away from his family and the community he has
served and can continue to serve, would be fundamentally unjust.''
   The defense noted that all other Iran-Contra defendants convicted
of crimes, including former White House aide Oliver L. North, were
given terms of probation.
   ``If there is a distinction between these men and John Poindexter
which the court should consider at sentencing, it is this: whatever
John Poindexter has done, his actions were always motivated by what
he truly believed to be the best interests of the presidency of the
United States,'' Beckler said.
   Poindexter, 53, was convicted April 7 of making false statements
to Congress by denying that the White House staff was secretly
helping to arm the Contra rebels in Nicaragua after Congress had
banned U.S. aid.
   He was also convicted of lying, destroying and altering documents
to conceal the U.S. role in a 1985 shipment of Israeli Hawk missiles
to Iran.
   Reagan, who gave a videotaped deposition that was played to
jurors, testified that he never authorized Poindexter to break the
law or lie.
   Prosecutors said the sentence ``must include a period of
incarceration'' because the ``diet of lies'' Poindexter fed Congress
``did violence to this nation's fundamental principles of
government.''
   Beckler said Poindexter has suffered enough since the Iran-Contra
affair became public.
   ``He has lost a bright and promising career in the United States
Navy, he has endured the public ridicule of the Congress and the
media, and he has suffered financial hardship,'' the lawyer said.
``Most painful of all, he has been convicted.''

   Thirteen surviving Munchkins will follow a
real yellow brick road this weekend to pay tribute to the star of
``The Wizard of Oz.''
   They're off to see the birthplace of the late Frances Ethel Gumm
_ better known as Judy Garland _ who would have celebrated her 68th
birthday Sunday.
   The diminutive actors and actresses will trek to Grand Rapids and
walk down a yellow brick road built last year to honor Garland, who
left the northern Minnesota city as a youngster and was 15 when she
starred as Dorothy in the 1939 movie. She died of a drug overdose in
1969.
   A parade and an exhibit of private photographs of Garland are
among the planned festivities as part of the weeklong Judy Garland
Festival.
   It's touted as the largest gathering of Munchkins since
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the movie. About two dozen of the 124
Munchkins are still alive.
   ``I'm especially glad to be here with all my old pals,'' said
Jerry Maren, 69, the only surviving member of the Lollipop Guild. In
the movie, the three-member guild welcomed Dorothy to Munchkinland
by giving her an enormous striped lollipop.
   The Munchkinland scene lasted only 10 minutes. But it took nearly
seven weeks to shoot and helped make the movie a classic.
   Most of the Munchkins earned just $50 a week for their services.
   ``They paid Toto more than they paid me,'' quipped former
Munchkin Fern Formica.
   Meinhardt Raabe, who played the coroner who pronounced the Wicked
Witch of the East dead, said the Munchkins didn't know much about
the rest of the movie while they worked.
   ``We didn't have the script. All we had was the script for
Munchkinland. After we left, they shot the rest of the picture.''
   In his book ``The Munchkins Remembered,'' Stephen Cox says
gathering more than 100 midgets under one roof would be nearly
impossible to repeat today.
   Unlike dwarfs, midgets have bodies that are proportionately
correct, and advances in hormonal treatment now enable them to grow
to near-normal stature.
   ``There just aren't enough little people any more,'' Maren said
wistfully. Formica said he doesn't think ``The Wizard of Oz'' is
dated.
   ``I think it'll be around for another 50 years,'' he said. ``I
feel like someone much larger than us has had his hand on it from
the very beginning.''

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 152.65 yen, up 0.10 yen from
Thursday's close of 152.55 yen. After opening at 152.58 yen, the
currency ranged between 152.55 yen and 152.63 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 199.21
points, or 0.60 percent, closing at 32,993.29 points. The Nikkei
index gained 239 points on Thursday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged lower at 87.75 points as of 3 p.m.
(0600 GMT), compared with Thursday's close of 87.94. The yield rose
to 7.020 percent from the previous day's 6.980 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar-yen rate showed little change
because of an absence of major market-affecting news and the
approach of the weekend.
   ``Nothing is going on here,'' said another dealer with the Bank
of Tokyo.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started moderately higher
in a follow-through to Thursday's gains, but later moved lower in
the absence of fresh incentives, securities dealers said.
   ``The market as a whole is taking a wait-and-see mood,'' said
Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
urged the United States to participate actively in rebuilding
Eastern Europe, and envisioned an open-border Europe in which
nations had overcome ``mutual prejudice.''
   In an address Thursday at Harvard University's commencement
ceremonies, Kohl reaffirmed that the border between Germany and
Poland should remain intact, but open.
   ``We Germans do not want to couple the unity of our fatherland
with the displacement of existing borders,'' he said. Kohl had drawn
protests when he last visited the United States early this year over
his refusal to categorically rule out a shift in borders.
   Kohl, who received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, said Europe
and the United States needed to develop more intense political
connections, possibly through new institutions, in ensuring the
success of Europe's drive toward unification.
   ``My message today is this: German-American friendship is a
decisive prerequisite for Europe and America managing to cope in
unison with the tasks of the future,'' said Kohl, who meets today
with President Bush at the end of a four-day visit.
   ``The Europeans and Americans must together elucidate their
vision of a better world in which coming generations can thrive,''
he said.
   Kohl painted an optimistic portrait of an economically and
politically prosperous Europe that could dispense with borders.
   ``The United States of Europe will ... form the core of a
peaceful order in which the nations of the old continent finally
overcome former rivalry, chauvinist thinking, and mutual
prejudice,'' he said.
   ``Europe of the future will be a continent of diversity that
affords the regions and nations new opportunities for
self-development. This naturally includes above all, the protection
of ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities.''
   Kohl drew appreciative applause in stressing the importance of
German unification for the human, political and economic gains of
Europe.
   ``Unification of Germany will ... impart a strong impetus to the
process of European integration, which will result not least in an
economic upswing from which many will benefit,'' he said.
   Events in Europe, he said, must not distract attention from the
problems of the Third World, of the need to preserve the environment
and to continue to work for human rights and self-determination
around the world.
   Harvard, the oldest university in the country, founded in 1636
and with a student body of 17,700, conferred 5,600 undergraduate and
graduate degrees before an audience of more than 20,000 people.
   The university also conferred honorary doctorates on physicist
Stephen W. Hawking, singer Ella Fitzgerald, social scientist David
Riesman, poet and essayist Adrienne Rich, Nobel Memorial
Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon, and Boston school principal
Michael Kimbrough Marshall.
   Kohl's son, Walter, graduated from Harvard College in 1989. A
second son, Peter, is a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few American students are hooked on books and
even fewer possess essential writing skills, according to a
congressionally required study.
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress, popularly known
as the Nation's Report Card, said few school students in grades
four, eight and 12 have actually mastered reading and writing,
mainly because most parents don't work with them at home and few
teachers require much reading or writing in class or for homework.
   Even more troubling are the wide gaps in achievement between
whites and minorities, said Roy Truby, executive director of the
National Assessment Governing Board.
   The average assessment on the writing test for 12th-grade blacks
is only slightly better than the average for fourth-grade whites;
Hispanics are nearly as low.
   On the reading exam, on the other hand, which was primarily
multiple-choice, the average black or Hispanic 12th grader performed
at about the same level as the average for eighth-grade whites. This
has been the pattern in many previous exams.
   ``No student should be allowed to go through the education system
without mastering the essential skills of reading and writing,''
said Christopher Cross of the Education Department, which released
the study.
   ``The data underscore the urgent need for parents and teachers to
foster essential literacy skills through daily practice,'' Cross
said.
   Key results were:
   _The average reading proficiency of schoolchildren increased
substantially from grade four to grade eight, and somewhat less
dramatically between grades eight and 12. In general, students
appeared to have great difficulty with explaining what they had
read, but less difficulty with questions asking about overall
meaning and specific details.
   _Students reported doing very little reading in school and for
homework. At all three grade levels assessed, 47 percent to 61
percent reported reading 10 or fewer pages each day for schoolwork
across the curriculum.
   _Sixty-nine percent of the fourth graders reported watching three
hours or more of television each day, while less than half, 46
percent, reported reading for pleasure on a daily basis.
   _About one-third of the eighth and 12th graders reported that
they never discuss reading at home. These students had significantly
lower reading proficiency.
   _Eighth-grade English teachers reported that 45 percent of their
students wrote papers of a paragraph or two weekly, and only 14
percent wrote a one- or two-page paper each week. Only 6 percent
wrote papers of three or more pages each week.
   Truby said the 1988 assessment data released Thursday was based
on different tests than those reported earlier for measuring trends.
The writing assessment gave students more time to write out some of
their responses _ up to 30 minutes in some cases, instead of the
previous 15-minute limit.
   Truby said the longer format in the writing test raised the
average performance result for white students, but had little effect
on the scores of blacks and Hispanics.
   ``As a result, the racial gap appears wider on the writing exam
than on other NAEP assessments.''
   The study also found that children who had preschool classes in
reading scored higher than those who did not but the racial gap is
slightly greater for those with preschool experience than for those
without.
   NAEP released the first reading and writing reports in January.
   The two studies present additional findings from a national
sample of 13,000 students in reading and 20,000 students in writing,
as well as information from fourth-grade reading teachers and
eighth-grade writing teachers.

   A 1965 Volvo, boxer shorts and Blues Brothers
suits, hats and eyeglasses are among a wide assortment of the late
comedian John Belushi's possessions going on the auction block
Saturday.
   ``We have all kinds of personal memorabilia: clothing,
photographs, autographs, artwork, guitars, movie scripts, you name
it,'' said Maron Matz, spokeswoman for Leslie Hindman Auctioneers,
an auction house normally reserved for more staid sales of fine art
and antiques.
   All proceeds from the auction will benefit the John Belushi
Memorial Foundation, which funds the John Belushi Scholarship for
aspiring actors at Second City, a Chicago comedy troupe, and the
Second Chance Foundation, founded by Belushi's widow and her fiance
on Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
   ``I've been planning to do an auction for some time,'' Judy
Jacklin Belushi said in a telephone interview Thursday from Martha's
Vineyard.
   ``It came to me slowly when people would ask me for something for
various charities. When I moved one time, I realized how much stuff
I had,'' Mrs. Belushi said.
   She mentioned her idea to fiance Victor Pisano, who liked it.
Together they founded Second Chance, which they hope will fund
various charities on the island, and prepared for the auction. Mrs.
Belushi said she hopes to raise at least $50,000.
   They will keep some things, like Belushi's Jeep and souvenirs
from a trip he and Mrs. Belushi took to the Orient. But the best of
the memorabilia will be auctioned, Pisano said.
   Among the items: a 1965 Volvo given to Belushi by his wife,
scripts from four movies he appeared in, and boxer shorts with the
inscription ``Continental Divide,'' one of the movies.
   There are six suits, three worn by Belushi and three worn by Dan
Aykroyd in ``The Blues Brothers'' movie. There are Blues Brothers
eyeglasses and hats.
   There's a toy soldier painted by Belishi, hand-knitted John and
Judy Christmas stockings, Hawaiian shirts, a set of golf clubs,
posters, a Chicago Cubs wastebasket and a 1944 Cubs baseball.
   Also: unemployment insurance claim cards, a citizens' band radio,
bound volumes of early National Lampoon magazines, much of his album
collection, slippers, monogrammed suitcases and briefcases and a
laminated column Mike Royko wrote about Belushi and signed for him.
   Belushi died of a drug overdose on March 5, 1982, at the age of
33. He was a favorite on NBC-TV's ``Saturday Night Live,'' where he
played memorable roles as an outrageous Samurai warrior, one of the
``Killer Bees'' and a violent television commentator.
   Besides ``The Blues Brothers'' and ``Continental Divide,'' the
Chicago native appeared in such movies as ``1941,'' ``Neighbors,''
``Goin' South'' with Jack Nicholson, and the acclaimed ``Animal
House.''

   Mayor Marion Barry is ``open to talks'' on a
possible plea bargain agreement in his cocaine and perjury case,
Jesse Jackson says.
   Jackson's comment Thursday followed a lunch meeting with Barry,
who later denied a report that he would announce in the next day or
two that he won't seek re-election.
   Barry refused to discuss the meeting with Jackson as he left the
federal courthouse where jury selection for his trial continued.
   But Barry did address the suggestion of an imminent announcement
that he won't seek re-election.
   ``If you hold your breath, you'll die,'' the mayor said through
spokeswoman Lurma Rackley. He added there was no truth to the report
broadcast on a local television station.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession, three felony counts of lying to a grand jury and
one count of conspiracy.
   Negotiations leading to a guilty plea on one or more of the 14
charges have stalled, sources close to Barry's legal team say.
   But Barry ``is open to talks as opposed to a drawing-the-line
situation,'' Jackson said in a televised interview after he met with
the mayor.
   ``I am rather convinced the mayor is inclined to ... do something
to break the cycle and break the tension,'' Jackson said. ''I hope
it happens sooner than later.''
   Barry's lawyers and the prosecutors are ``nowhere right now'' in
terms of plea bargaining, one source familiar with the situation
said.
   ``It's increasingly unlikely that we will have any agreement
soon,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Jackson associates say he has been urging Barry for six weeks not
to seek re-election and to strike a plea bargain with the government.
   The jury selection process continued in Barry's trial, with 13
prospective jurors sent into a pool from which a panel of 12 jurors
and six alternates will be chosen.
   The total number of prospective jurors in the pool now stands at
37. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he would
continue the selection process through the end of next week. It
likely will take that long to question over 200 prospective jurors
who have filled out questionnaires for the case.

   As animal rights activists prepared for a
weekend march in the nation's capital, federal health officials
turned up the verbal heat, branding as ``terrorists'' the protesters
who storm research labs.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said he
refused to be intimidated by the violent tactics of some animal
advocates and predicted ``they will not succeed because they are on
the wrong side of morality.''
   Sullivan said animal research has saved millions of lives and
holds promise for new therapies to treat devastating illnesses like
Alzheimer's disease.
   ``It would be evil to forsake animal research when lives hang in
the balance,'' he said at a news conference Thursday.
   He said he was ``saddened and a bit angry that we have to put up
with major disruptions to science by so-called animal activists who
are, in fact, nothing more than animal rights terrorists.''
   Medical schools are spending about $6 million annually for damage
from break-ins at research labs and other disruptive activities and
for tighter security, the Association of American Medical Colleges
said.
   Sullivan said ``virtually everyone agrees that unnecessary animal
research or the cruel use of animals is wrong.'' But he said such
incidents are rare because of regulations that require humane
treatment of animals.
   Activists responded that supporters of animal research were
perpetuating the myth that animals must be sacrificed to improve
human health.
   ``Responsible medical professionals should be promoting quality
research and effective disease prevention, not aligning themselves
with pork farmers and other industry groups whose policies erode
human health,'' the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine
said.
   The animal advocates said Sullivan was ignoring the continuing
exploitation of laboratory animals that suffer while alternative,
non-animal testing methods are available.
   Animal rights activists plan to gather in the nation's capital on
Sunday to ``March for the Animals,'' which is being coordinated by
the National Alliance for Animals' Educational Fund.
   The march will focus on all kinds of animal exploitation _ from
their use in medical experiments to zoos and circuses _ and embrace
varying ideologies _ from those who would protect all animals all
the time to those with more moderate views.
   ``We try to encourage legislation to put an end to abuse of
animals,'' said Rebecca McGinley, events coordinator for the march.
``There are some people who want larger cages and some who want no
cages ... we want to embrace all the people who are concerned. It's
not an event to force issues on people.''
   Ingrid Newkirk, national director of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, said she is ``morally opposed to exploitation
of any individual or group of individuals who cannot fight for
themselves.
   ``So I believe there is always a way if you look to get
information without using animals,'' she said.
   She said Sullivan was wrong in claiming that inhumane treatment
of research animals was rare.
   ``We can't even get them to stop cutting off the toes of rabbits
to identify them,'' she said.

   A landscape of teen pregnancies, illegal drug
use and violence threatens the health and well-being of the nation's
adolescents, a commission of health, medical and business leaders
said today.
   The commission, in a report assessing the health of American
adolescents, concluded that ``young people are less healthy and less
prepared to take their places in society than were their parents.''
   Among the troubling signs cited by the panel were:
   _1 million teen-age girls _ nearly 1 in 10 _ get pregnant each
year.
   _39 percent of high school seniors reported they had gotten drunk
within the two previous weeks.
   _The suicide rate for teens has doubled since 1968.
   _Teen-age arrests are up 30-fold since 1950.
   _Homicide is the leading cause of death among 15-19 year old
minority youths.
   ``Unhealthy teen-agers ... are unlikely to attain the high levels
of education achievement required for success in the 21st century,''
the commission's report said.
   ``Thousands of these young people will experience school failure,
which for many will be a precursor to an adult life of crime,
unemployment or welfare dependency,'' the report said.
   The commission was formed by the National Association of State
Boards of Education and the American Medical Association to make
recommendations on the role of the school and community in improving
adolescent health.
   The 37 panel members included former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, Pollster George Gallup Jr., former Education Commissioner
Ernest Boyer, Illinois Gov. James Thompson and California school
chief Bill Honig.
   The commission recommended that all teen-agers be guaranteed
access to health services, regardless of their ability to pay. This
health care should include psycho-social as well as medical
services, the report said.
   Also, communities should set up adolescent health centers in
schools or other convenient locations, financed by local, state and
federal funds as well as by private money.
   The report did not estimate the cost for these services.
   It also called on schools to play a larger role in improving
adolescents' health. It suggested ``a new kind of health education _
a sophisticated multi-faceted program that goes light years beyond
present lectures about personal hygiene.'' Such a program should
include sex education, the panel said.
   ``The commission calls upon this nation to recognize that
adolescents will not achieve their potential if they have social,
emotional and physical health problems that interfere with their
learning, and that they will cost society millions of dollars in
medical and social costs if they continue to engage in
health-risking behaviors,'' the report said.
   ``The future is bleak if we do not invest more in our nation's
greatest resource _ our young people.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Student Can't Graduate After Failing English Test by One
Point.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college-bound Vietnamese high school
student who failed an English test by a single point won't be
allowed to graduate with her peers.
   No exceptions are made on the district's competency tests, which
all students must pass to graduate, said Superintendent Pat Sandro.
   ``I'm sure people would say, `Just give her the test again,'''
Sandro said. ``But if you don't have standards, where do you draw
the line?''
   Ngoc-Nu Lam spoke virtually no English when she arrived from her
native Vietnam six years ago. She has a B average at Union High
School, and has been accepted at Ferris State University, where she
hoped to study computer science.
   The 21 year old said she canceled her order for a cap and gown
for Thursday night's commencement after hearing she would not be
allowed to participate.
   ``I would like to march with the others,'' said Lam, who also
skipped an honors ceremony earlier this week in which she was to
receive the Presidential Academic Fitness Award.
   Sandro said Lam can retake the test in August, but Lam and
supporters are urging Sandro to have the test regraded or allow her
to retake it immediately. They say the wait might jeopardize college
financial aid, even if she passes.
   Peggy Chance-Hicks, a Grand Valley State University tutor who
works with Lam in a bilingual student program, said Lam failed the
conversational English part of the test in which students read a
paragraph and rewrite it conversationally.
   Conversational English is one of Lam's weaknesses since her
family speaks Chinese or Vietnamese at home, Chance-Hicks said.
   She said the way the section is graded may have an inherent
cultural bias.
   ``When the test becomes a barrier to a student _ who through
their own tenacity and self-perseverance will become a success _
then it is a problem,'' Chance-Hicks said.

<HEAD>Moynihan Presents Social Security Plan at Budget Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., got a
mixed reception when he tried to sell his plan to cut Social
Security taxes to high-level budget negotiators, participants said.
   Moynihan visited Thursday's sixth session of private budget talks
between Bush administration officials and congressional leaders.
   Most of the day was spent discussing the possibility of cutting
federal benefit programs in order to reduce the budget deficit, with
talks focusing on technical issues. No offers were exchanged.
   Moynihan has proposed rolling back the 7.65 percent levy workers
pay to the retirement system. He argues that Social Security builds
a surplus of tens of billions of dollars every year, money that is
used to shrink the apparent size of the deficit.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said there was ``not as much positive
support'' for Moynihan's plan among negotiators as he had thought
there might be. He predicted the plan ``has little chance of
passing'' Congress.

<HEAD>New Type of Vaccine Elicits Desired Response</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A candidate vaccine produced by genetic
engineering fights the virus that produces AIDS, researchers at
Johns Hopkins University have reported.
   The vaccine uses gene-splicing techniques to produce a chain of
proteins mimicking a portion of the surface of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS.
   Vaccines against viruses usually are made of the whole virus,
crippled so that it cannot cause the disease in question, or killed
virus.
   The Johns Hopkins team reported its work Thursday in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   The candidate vaccine was injected into eight volunteers four
times over 18 months _ an initial injection followed by three
boosters.
   At the end of 18 months, three of the eight had developed a
response in which the cells of their immune systems attacked the HIV
virus and the cells it infected.
   They did so without attacking the so-called ``innocent
bystander'' uninfected cells of the immune system, a major problem
in AIDS research.
   The test vaccine is a long way from being shown to be a possible
weapon against AIDS. Further clinical tests, which could take years
to complete, must be conducted before the vaccine could be used.

<HEAD>Labor Secretary Meets Separately With Both Sides in Greyhound
Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has no plans to
intervene in the three-month-old Greyhound strike, but has met with
both sides in the dispute, now tied up in bankruptcy courts.
   Mrs. Dole met Thursday with Edward M. Strait, president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.
   Last week, the labor secretary met with Fred Currey, chairman of
Greyhound Lines Inc., at Currey's request, said Dale Tate, a
spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole.
   Union leaders representing the 6,300 striking drivers were
invited following the Currey visit, Ms. Tate said. It was an
informational session like the Currey meeting, she said.
   Mrs. Dole does not plan to intervene but is keeping on top of any
progress being made by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, Ms. Tate said. Bargaining talks have not been held since
early May.
   Greyhound, which lost $56 million in the first three months of
1990, filed for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy laws on Monday so that buses can continue
operating through the peak summer season.
   On Thursday in Brownsville, Texas, a bankruptcy judge gave the
bus line permission to keep paying operating expenses so buses could
keep rolling. He also ordered the establishment of a creditors'
committee in time for a second hearing June 28.

<HEAD>Chinese Lodge Protest Over Quayle Meeting with Student Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China said it was indignant and lodged a
protest with the United States for allowing a Chinese student leader
who recently escaped after 10 months in hiding to meet Vice
President Dan Quayle and testify before a Senate committee.
   The Chinese Embassy on Thursday called the student, Chai Ling,
``a criminal wanted by the Chinese Public Security Department.''
   In a statement read by press officer Zhu Taoying, the embassy
said, ``Yet Vice President Quayle chose to meet her and the Senate
of the U.S. Congress brazenly allowed ... (a) forum to attack the
Chinese government. The Chinese government and the people express
their utmost indignation at this.''
   The Chinese ambassador, Zhu Qizhen, went to the State Department
Thursday to see Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state.
   The embassy charged that the United States had ``gravely violated
the norms of international relations, and wantonly interfered in the
internal affairs of China.''
   ``We have lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government
through the diplomatic channels,'' the embassy said.
   The Bush administration was clearly intent on according the
Chinese pro-democracy protest leader a high-level welcome. Her
meeting with the vice president Thursday ran almost three times its
allotted 20 minutes.
   Ms. Ling told reporters afterwards that she had stressed the
importance of Voice of America broadcasts in getting the truth to
the Chinese people, and urged that the radio service's broadcast
signal be strengthened if possible.
   She also asked that the United States link any trade concessions
to improvements in China's human rights record.
   Ms. Ling went into hiding after Chinese troops opened fire on
pro-democracy demonstrators last year near Tiananmen Square in
Beijing.
   The Bush administration has decided to renew for another year
most favored nation trade status for China, despite Beijing's
continuing crackdown on pro-democracy forces. The designation means
that Chinese goods exported to the United States would be subject to
the lowest possible tariffs.
   Quayle told Ms. Ling that the United States remains
``disappointed by the lack of progress on human rights'' in China,
his spokesman David Beckwith said.
   Ms. Ling, 24, is a former graduate student in child psychology at
Peking Normal University. She has been granted asylum by France.

<HEAD>Sources Say FBI Agent To Plead Guilty in Slaying of Woman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An FBI agent faces 16 years in prison after
agreeing to plead guilty to manslaughter in the strangulation death
of a pregnant woman who vanished a year ago, law enforcement sources
say.
   The sources and the victim's sister, Shelby Ward, said the agent
would enter his plea next Tuesday in Pike Circuit Court. They said
no charges had been filed against him.
   Kentucky State Police and the FBI have been investigating the
disappearance of Mrs. Ward's sister, Susan Daniels Smith, who was
last seen on June 8, 1989.
   Outraged at the plea agreement, Mrs. Ward defied prosecutors'
wishes and discussed the case in detail with The Associated Press.
   ``I think he should have been tried for murder, because it's
cold-blooded murder to me,'' she said. ``I shook my head. I couldn't
believe it. ... My family's all upset about this.''
   Mrs. Ward said she was told the agent ``confessed to killing my
sister'' during an argument in Pikeville over support of her
expected child. Mrs. Ward said her sister had told her the agent was
the father.
   She said prosecutor John Paul Runyon, state police Capt. Gary
Rose and an FBI agent told her Tuesday that the agent described in a
statement how he strangled Ms. Smith and dumped her nude body off a
rural coal mine road at Harmond Branch, about five miles north of
Pikeville.
   Officials at all those agencies refused to comment publicly on
reports of the plea agreement. But law enforcement sources speaking
on the condition they not be identified confirmed details of Mrs.
Ward's story for The Associated Press.
   On Tuesday, state police and FBI officials said they had found
human skeletal remains at Harmond Branch. David Wolf of the state
medical examiner's office said Thursday the skeleton was that of a
white woman.
   The Williamson, W.Va., Daily News on Thursday identified the
agent as Mark Putnam, who was transferred from Pikeville to Miami
last year. Ms. Smith was an FBI informant for him on at least two
cases, the newspaper said.
   Attempts to reach Putnam for comment were not immediately
successful. Directory assistance in Miami had no telephone listing
for Putnam. In Miami, an FBI spokesman referred a reporter to the
agency's Washington headquarters when asked if Putnam was based in
Miami.
   Greg Jones, an FBI spokesman in Washington, refused to comment on
the case. When asked whether to his knowledge there had ever been a
case of an FBI agent charged in a murder, he said: ``I don't believe
there ever has been.''
   Mrs. Ward said in an interview at her home in Freeburn on
Wedneday that her sister, an eighth-grade dropout and divorced
mother of two, had repeatedly requested several thousand dollars in
support.
   ``She wanted him to leave his wife. She was threatening to tell
his wife about the baby and (the agent) was scared to death,'' Mrs.
Ward said.
   Mrs. Ward said she was told by the officials that the agent
placed her sister's body in the trunk of his car and disposed of it
a day later _ after he made a business trip to Lexington.
   ``What was so bad is when he took the body and dumped it over the
hill like it was nothing,'' she said.

   The 31-year-old entertainer, who checked into the hospital
Sunday, suffered from costochondritis, or cartilage inflammation of
the front part of the ribs, Dr. Mark Zatzkis said in a statement

   A letter from Gen. George S. Patton Jr.
describing how he ordered soldiers to attack after they had chosen
to retreat sold for $17,600, the highest price ever paid for a
typewritten letter sold at auction.
   ``The interesting thing was that the simple statement on my part
that they would attack removed the nervous tension,'' Patton said in
the letter sold Thursday. ``It is really amazing what the
determination on the part of one man can do to many thousands.''
   The hand-signed letter was written from Europe in 1944 to Gen.
Charles Summerall, a former Army Chief of Staff in the 1920s and one
of Patton's teachers at West Point. It was sold at Herman Darvick
Autograph Auctions.
   The letter was purchased by a private New Jersey collector who
wished to remain anonymous, a catalogue said.
   Among letters from U.S. military leaders, only letters from
George Washington have sold for more, Herman Darvick said.
   Seven Patton letters sold for $50,325.
   One item that went unsold was a handwritten 1967 letter in which
Ronald Reagan admonished his then 14-year-old daughter Patti for
using ``deception'' to hide her smoking.
   The seller, a Connecticut collector of presidential memorabilia,
had set a minimum sale price of $20,000 but the bidding only reached
$19,000, Darvick said.
   Ms. Davis, 37, sold the letter for about $5,000 to an unknown
buyer who later sold it to the Connecticut collector, he said.
   Other items at the auction included:
   _Greta Garbo's last movie contract, signed in 1941 for ``Two
Faced Woman,'' sold for $5,500.
   _A 1955 document signed by then-Emperor Hirohito awarding Japan's
highest honor, the Order of the Rising Sun, to Gen. Maxwell D.
Taylor, sold for $8,800.
   _An 8-by-10-inch sketch of Mickey Mouse signed by his creator,
Walt Disney, sold for $16,000.
   Earlier Thursday, an 1847 letter from Charlotte Bronte to the
publisher of her novel ``Jane Eyre,'' sold at Christie's auction
house for $52,800. Signed with the Victorian author's pen name,
Currer Bell, the letter tells how she was unable to pay for the
mailing of the novel's manuscript.
   ``If when you acknowledge the receipt of the M.S. you will have
the goodness to mention the amount charged on delivery, I will
immediately transmit it in postage stamps,'' she wrote.
   The book was published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. within six weeks.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Searches for Missing Plane Near Virgin Islands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard has begun searching the waters
near the Virgin Islands for a small plane missing since Tuesday with
one woman aboard.
   The Piper 28 aircraft was en route from the Dutch-French island
of St. Martin to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands when it
disappeared, Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Thursday night.
   A Piper 28 is a single-engine plane, and the distance from St.
Martin to St. Croix is about 100 miles.
   Farrar identified the pilot as Mary Pomeroy. He said that details
were sketchy but that it was believed that Ms. Pomeroy was a British
noblewoman, possibly known as the countess of Malta or duchess of
Malta.
   Reference books on the British nobility list one Rosamond Mary
Pomeroy _ the sister of Thomas de Vautort Pomeroy, 10th viscount of
Harberton. Reached at home on the Isle of Wight, Miss Pomeroy was
surprised to learn she was feared to be missing at sea.
   She said a woman who once lived with a cousin of hers on another
Caribbean island legally took the name Pomeroy decades ago, but she
had no idea if this was the missing pilot.
   ``It's absolutely nothing to do with our family, the Harberton
family, because we would know,'' Miss Pomeroy said. ``Unless it's
this woman who took the name by deed poll when she was living with
as cousin of mine in St. Kitts and Nevis, at least 30 years ago.''
   The missing airplane left St. Martin about 3:05 p.m. Tuesday,
flying under visual flight rules, Farrar said. The pilot radioed
about seven minutes later that she was in level flight at about
4,500 feet, and that was the last transmission from the plane.
   A squall line had been reported between St. Martin and St. Croix
about that time, Farrar said.
   The search did not begin until Wednesday because it was initially
reported that the plane had turned back to St. Martin, Farrar said.
   Coast Guard helicopters, a C-130 airplane and a cutter searched
an area about 40 miles from St. Martin but found nothing, he said.

   A retired police dog that had helped save
six people and arrest more that 100 people returned his nose to
service long enough to help find a missing blind and deaf 3-year-old.
   ``It brought tears to my eyes to get that kid last night,''
deputy sheriff Michael Bushman of Manitowoc County said Thursday.
``I truly believe that, had that child been out overnight, she would
have succumbed to exposure.''
   Angela Bolle, who has Down's syndrome, wandered away from her
family's yard while playing with friends Wednesday evening.
   About 100 deputies and volunteers were unsuccessful searching
nearby woods with two other dogs.
   As daylight faded, searchers summoned Duke, an 8-year-old German
shepherd that retired two years ago because of waning stamina.
   After sniffing for 40 minutes, he caught the girl's scent and
found her lying face down and crying in a hay field 600 feet from
the house, Bushman said.
   ``The dog caught wind of her about 100 feet away. I didn't see
her until I was standing over the top of her,'' he said. ``He went
right in and started licking her face. His tail was wagging about a
mile a minute.
   ``He likes kids a lot.''

friend, authorities said.
   William Detrick died Wednesday after collapsing in the driveway
of his neighbor, Jack Shearer.
   Detrick and his wife, Betty, had been summoned by Sarah Shearer
after her husband suffered a heart attack while sitting on his front
porch, said Detrick's son, William, of Cincinnati.
   Mrs. Detrick called an ambulance after her husband collapsed.
   ``When we got there, we found two people with cardiac arrests,
instead of one like we thought,'' an unidentified paramedic told the
Beaver County Times.
   The couples had been close friends for many years, said William
Detrick.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Challenge to Census Adjustment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge rebuffed a group of states and
cities led by New York City that challenged Commerce Department
guidelines for deciding whether the 1990 census should be adjusted
to compensate for any undercount.
   Judge Joseph McLaughlin upheld the guidelines, which the group,
including New York state, Los Angeles, California and other
governments, had argued were biased against the very idea of a
statistical adjustment.
   The census is intended to reach and count every person. But
critics argue that distrust and fear of government among some
minority groups, particularly immigrants and the poor, ensure they
will be undercounted.
   McLaughlin said the guidelines were not biased, but said some of
the criteria ``lend themselves easily to abuse.'' He warned he would
not tolerate any ``backdoor attempts'' by the Commerce Department,
which runs the Census Bureau, to make an unfair decision about
whether to adjust the count.
   The census is used to decide the amount of federal aid each city
and state gets. It also determines representation in Congress and
state legislatures.
   The general counsel of the Commerce Department, Wendell Willkie
II, said his agency was ``extremely pleased'' with the judge's
decision.
   Under the guidelines upheld by the judge, it is up to the
secretary of commerce, Robert Mosbacher, to decide whether to make
the statistical adjustment.
   The guidelines do not set technical standards but state, among
other things, that an adjustment must not violate the U.S.
Constitution.
   The Commerce Department must decide for or against adjustment by
July 15, 1991.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams said his department had
wanted the guidelines struck down, but said ``we are nevertheless
heartened by his stern warnings to the department that a decision
not to adjust will be closely scrutinized.''
   Mayor David Dinkins, who has said the guidelines all but
precluded an adjustment, said he hoped the Commerce Department would
fulfill its obligations for a complete count.
   ``It is an especially heavy burden because it is impossible for
the department to explain why a census intended to count every
American fails to count so many,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shamir Working To Meet Sundown Deadline</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Shamir aide's comments, radio
pulling back, details. No pickup. Changes byline.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was ironing out
last-minute obstacles to forming a narrow right-wing government
today and hoped to meet a sundown deadline, an aide said.
   If Shamir manages to pull together a right-wing Cabinet, it would
replace the coalition between his Likud bloc and the center-left
Labor Party that collapsed more than 2{ months ago.
   Israel radio reported early today that Shamir had apparently
pulled together a coalition. Later, however, its reports became less
certain as meetings dragged on between the prime minister and
potential coalition partners.
   Likud officials said Shamir had support from 62 members of the
120-seat Parliament, but news reports said last-minute differences
with ultra-Orthodox religious parties could upset the coalition.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said Shamir, who is caretaker
prime minister, expected to sign a coalition agreement with at least
eight small far-right and religious factions in his office later
today.
   With firm agreements, Shamir would be able to fulfill the legal
requirement of informing President Chaim Herzog that he has a
government. Then a vote could be scheduled in the Knesset, or
parliament, to install the new Cabinet.
   If Shamir succeeds, the Knesset would likely be convened on
Monday.
   The 42 days given Shamir to form a government technically end at
midnight, but the Jewish Sabbath begins at sundown.
   The coalition agreement was being held up by a disagreement
between two religious parties _ the National Religious Party and the
ultra-Orthodox Degel Hatorah _ over control of the Religious Affairs
Ministry.
   Another ultra-Orthodox party, Shas, or the Torah Guardians, was
given the Interior Ministry but asked for one more important Cabinet
post. It reportedly rejected the Economy Ministry as not prestigious
enough.
   National Religious Party leader Zevulun Hammer came to Shamir's
office today and said he would discuss his differences with Degel
Hatorah.
   The state-run radio reported that key posts in the new Cabinet
have already been assigned.
   It said the Foreign Ministry would be headed by David Levy, now
housing minister and a chief rival to Shamir for leadership of
Likud. The defense portfolio would go to Shamir's closest ally,
current Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, it said.
   Former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon will get the Housing
Ministry and head a group of ministers dealing with immigration, the
radio said. Sharon, as defense minister in 1982, engineered the
invasion of Lebanon.
   In the last election in November 1988, Likud won 40 seats and
Labor 39, forcing them into a so-called National Unity Government
despite their deep philosophical differences.
   The coalition collapsed in a parliament vote of no-confidence on
March 15 after Likud rejected Labor's demand to accept a U.S.
proposal for peace talks with Palestinians.
   News reports have said the 74-year-old Shamir would prefer
another coalition with Labor. In a right-wing government, he would
be squeezed between U.S. pressure to move forward with the peace
process and the far-right's refusal to do so.
   After the government's collapse, Labor leader Shimon Peres failed
in a 35-day effort to form a left-leaning government. Shamir was
given the mandate on April 27.
   The delicate coalition bargaining has involved a number of small
parties, each with different views. The National Religious Party and
Shas each have five seats in the Knesset, and Degel Hatorah has two.
   The lengthy bickering has raised demands for political reform to
end the system under which tiny parties hold the balance of power.
   Late Thursday, police clashed outside the prime minister's office
with protesters shouting they wanted an end to ``political
extortion.''

and Mississippi Valley.
   Rain fell in the southern tip of Florida and the coastal Pacific
Northwest.
   Showers also dampened the Great Lakes region, as a warm front

pushed east by the jet stream and bring evening thunderstorms to
much of New England.
   There were mostly clear skies and fair weather in the West.
   Early today, thunderstorms were over central Georgia and the
coast of South Carolina. Thunderstorms also were over Iowa,
Nebraska, Indiana and Michigan.
   Thunderstorms developing along a warm front produced severe
weather in the central Plains and the mid-Mississippi Valley on
Thursday.
   The storms over eastern Kansas spawned at least three tornadoes,
two in Missouri, two in South Dakota
   Almost 1{ inches of rain deluged Max, S.D., in 30 minutes.
   Golf-ball size hail was reported in eastern Nebraska, eastern
Kansas and southern Illinois.
   Winds gusted to 80 mph over central-western Iowa.

<HEAD>Jungle Battle Leaves at Least 48 Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle between two jungle tribes armed
with arrows, spears, machetes and poison darts in central Peru has
left at least 48 people dead, authorities said.
   The battle, involving at least 1,000 members of the Ashaminka
tribe and 200 members of the Campos tribe, took place Monday near
the Andean jungle town of Satipo, about 160 miles east of Lima, Gov.
Andres Galarza Flores of the Junin Department said Thursday.
   Witnesses said as many as 200 people died in the battle, with
most of the bodies thrown into the Perene River, Galarza said.
   Police investigating the battle found only three bodies but
confirmed that 48 people had died, Galarza said.
   Reports of the battle were delayed because there are no phones in
the area and transportation is slow, Galarza said.
   The two tribes are longtime rivals and have had earlier
confrontations over rights to grow coffee and coca in the area, he
said.
   Politics also may have played a part in the battle, Galarza said.
The Ashaminka are solidly behind presidential candidate Mario Vargas
Llosa, while the Campos support his rival, Alberto Fujimori. Vargas
Llosa faces Fujimori in a runoff Sunday.
   Witnesses said the battle started when a large truck entered the
Ashaminka town of Yarividoni during an important tribal festival.
   An Ashaminka watchman found up to 200 heavily armed Campos hidden
under a tarp on the truck's flatbed. Witnesses said the chief of the
Ashaminka then ordered his men to attack, Galarza said.
   There were unconfirmed reports that both sides also used
grenades, dynamite and rifles as well as their traditional weapons
in the battle, which lasted more than four hours.
   The Ashaminkas captured 10 of the Campos, who were later turned
over to police.
   There also were reports that militia groups from neighboring
towns joined with the Ashaminka in battling the Campos.
   Many tribes in the region have well-organized militias. Peruvian
soldiers have set them up to help tribespeople protect themselves
against Maoist Shining Path rebels.

<TEXT>
   A tornado touched down twice, wrecking
businesses and homes and blowing tractor-trailers and cars off a
highway in this east-central Kansas city. At least 21 people were
injured, two seriously, authorities said today.
   Another tornado Thursday night destroyed two homes in central
Missouri. Severe thunderstorms with high winds demolished 10 small
planes, damaged roofs and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power
lines in central and northern Missouri. No injuries were reported in
the state.
   The Emporia tornado tore a half-mile swath of destruction through
businesses on the city's west side and another about a quarter-mile
long to the northwest, police said.
   ``The damage is pretty severe to businesses and to the
residential area on the northwest side of town,'' said Emporia
police officer Laramy Bargo.
   Charles Brooks, a deacon at the West Side Baptist Church, said
about 15 members of the church sought shelter in the church
basement. When some people went upstairs to pray at the altar,
Brooks said, he took a look outside.
   ``There was a large tornado with a large tail and we watched it
go by. It looked like you could reach out and touch it,'' he said by
telephone from the church basement. ``Then we came inside and gave a
good thanks to God for our safety.''
   A 4-month-old girl and her father were critically injured in
their home, said Emporia Police Capt. Bob Rodriguez. He said the man
was trying to bring his daughter to safety when they were hit by
flying debris.
   Nineteen other people were injured and treated at Emporia
hospitals, said Kristy Kelley, a Lyon County Sheriff's dispatcher.
She said about 25 homes and two businesses were damaged in the
county.
   A gas station was destroyed, but three employees who hid in a
bathroom were not injured. Only two walls of the bathroom were left
standing.
   A nearby rental business, a car dealership and a restaurant were
among buildings heavily damaged. Authorities said the roof of a
Coca-Cola bottling plant caved in, damaging trucks and trailers.
Three employees who took cover in an inner room escaped injury.
   Police said one semi-trailer traveling south on the Kansas
Turnpike was knocked over. The tractor was found 100 yards from its
trailer. Injuries to the driver were unknown.
   Two people in another semi were hurt when their vehicle was
knocked off an Interstate 35 bypass, authorities said.
   About 2,500 Emporia customers were without electricity, said Tom
Taylor, spokesman for KPL Gas Service.
   The National Guard was activated, and 25 troops guarded damaged
areas. Shelters were opened.
   In central Missouri, a tornado destroyed two homes in Moniteau
County, deputy sheriff Russell Borts said. Other homes and
outbuildings in the area also were damaged.
   The deputy said a second tornado touched down south of High
Point, but there was no damage.
   A storm earlier Thursday demolished 10 planes and damaged six
others at the Spirit of St. Louis Airport in Chesterfield. The wind
also tore the roof off a hangar, causing an estimated $250,000
damage, said the building's owner, Barry Stone.
   Single-engine aircraft outside were strewn about. Some were
tossed upside down and others were severely damaged.
   Dick Hrabko, director of aviation for St. Louis County, said the
storm moved in about 4 p.m. with winds clocked up to 100 mph.
   Storm winds also tore the roof off school offices in Wright City
in Warren County, uprooted trees and damaged roofs and buildings in
St. Charles and damaged some buildings in the Earth City area.

<HEAD>`Elliot Loves,' A New Play by Jules Feiffer, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS last 8 grafs with other New York critics' reviews. Will
stand for PMs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boy, that Elliot sure has problems with women.
And he's not shy about revealing them _ at least not to a theater
audience.
   They are chronicled in exhaustive detail in ``Elliot Loves,''
Jules Feiffer's self-absorbed comedy-drama about the never-ending
struggles between male and female.
   The play, starring Anthony Heald and Christine Baranski and
directed by Mike Nichols, opened Thursday at off-Broadway's
Promenade Theater. It's a disappointment, considering the stature of
the playwright, the cast and the director. What starts out as a
promising look at how the sexes survive each other, turns into a
narrowly focused and theatrically static evening about some not very
nice or even interesting people and their not very nice or
interesting problems.
   Feiffer's dialogue is flip and occasionally very funny. His
characters make wry, witty observations, almost too witty to be
real. The one-liners would be more at home in the playwright's
brilliant weekly comic strip than in a full-length play.
   Feiffer's hero is a fortyish, Chicago polltaker, divorced and
trying to establish a relationship with Joanna, a slightly ditsy but
accommodating woman.
   ``I'll never do better. She's good for me,'' he tries to tell
himself and us in the play's opening monologue. If only he'd listen
to himself. But Elliot has hangups about love, not to say guilt
about establishing a commitment to someone new.
   ``The distance between what I need and what I'm getting is
love,'' he theorizes. It's that distance or gap that Elliot focuses
on, the one thing in his less-than-satisfactory life that has
quality, shape and substance.
   To validate his relationship with Joanna, Elliot takes her to
meet his three best friends. She charms them but not before old
wounds are opened up and the men reveal their bitterness about women
and each other.
   The unlikely buddies include a recovering alcoholic, a black
editor at Playboy and a misogynistic accountant who has had the
pleasure of driving his spouse's car over a cliff. How he survived
is a question the play doesn't address.
   The party ends disastrously with Elliot verbally attacking the
alcoholic, the nicest and weakest of his three friends. It seems
inconsistent with his personality which, until then, has been morose
but not malevolent.
   The boyish Heald is miscast as the guilt-ridden Elliot. There's
no sense of worry in his performance. He seems foolish rather than
frantic. The sexy, personable Baranski exudes a flaky likability as
she prepares for the dinner party and nervously tries to memorize
details about the men she is about to meet.
   Bruce A. Young, Oliver Platt and particularly David Pierce as the
sad sack alcoholic offer some strong support. Latanya Richardson is
wasted in an unnecessary role as one of the men's wives.
   Nichols' direction is determined, not letting the play's momentum
falter until the very end. Part of that motion is due to designer
Tony Walton's stylish set of a high-rise apartment that spins with
great ease.
   The play's final scene is a tedious telephone conversation
between a drunken Elliot and Joanna as they try to patch up their
tattered relationship. It nearly stops the play dead, as Elliot
keeps reiterating his love for the protesting Joanna.
   After a while, you want to shake the self-centered man and tell
him to get on with his life. That's because there's a lingering
suspicion the only person Elliot really loves is himself.
   The reviews by New York newspaper critics were generally poor.
   Most scribes were put off by the characters and the letdown after
an excellent opening monologue.
   Frank Rich in the New York Times, Howard Kissel in the Daily News
and Linda Winer in New York Newsday all disliked ``Elliot Loves.''
Clive Barnes of the New York Post enjoyed it.
   ``Feiffer asks theatergoers to spend an evening with empty
characters without offering the payoff of insight,'' said Rich,
adding that he found the play ``bleak and unsatisfying.''
   If ``Elliot Loves'' were as compelling, as entertaining, as
thoughtful as its opening monologue, it would be altogether
remarkable,'' wrote Kissel.
   ``There's enough material in the monologue to make a harrowing
and wonderful play. The heartbreak is that somehow, that play never
got written,'' Winer opined.
   Rich, Kissel and Winer all thought the acting was superb.
   In the Post, Barnes raved: ``Elliot Loves''..., in its
comparatively modest sketch-like way seems totally successful, not
to mention hilarious. I promise you, you will laugh and laugh.''

Redistricting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge gave Los Angeles County 20
days to submit a plan for remapping districts to give Hispanics more
representation, but did not rule whether Tuesday's election results
will stand.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon on Thursday warned he will ``do
whatever is necessary'' to devise a redistricting plan if the Board
of Supervisors fails to meet his June 27 deadline.
   ``I do believe time is important here,'' he declared.
   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who attended the federal court
hearing, told reporters 20 days was insufficient time to hold public
hearings on the issue. Antonovich is one of the board's conservative
majority which voted to appeal Kenyon's decision mandating new
districts.
   Hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the county's 8.7
million people, but no Hispanic has been elected to the board since
1875.
   Liberal supervisors have called for a settlement that would
increase the number of districts and supervisors to offer more
representation.
   Kenyon did not rule whether Tuesday's election results in two
supervisor races should be voided. But he remarked, ``The court
would note that none of the candidates ran without full knowledge
that this lawsuit was pending.''
   On Monday, the day before the election, Kenyon found the five
board members had conspired to ``protect their incumbencies and that
of their allies'' when they redrew the county's five voting
districts in 1981.
   The lawsuit, filed in August 1988, charged that the supervisors
deliberately spread the county's Hispanic population across several
districts when they changed voting boundaries following the 1980
federal census.
   Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which joined the U.S.
Justice Department lawsuit on the matter, said Kenyon's order put
those results in doubt.
   ``Obviously the implication is that Tuesday's election doesn't
really mean anything,'' said Richard Fajardo, a MALDEF attorney.
``Remember, that election took place under an unconstitutional
plan.''

<HEAD>NASA Cancels $700 Million ``Space Tug'' Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDONDO BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA has scrubbed a $700 million
program to build an orbital ``space tug'' designed to service
satellites, including the Hubble Space Telescope.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
``budgetary pressures'' and the lack of a ``firm near-term
requirement'' for the spacecraft influenced its decision.
   William B. Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for space
flight, said the space tug ``eventually will be needed in our space
infrastructure, but we will have at least two or three years to
develop firm requirements before it will be necessary to begin
development.''
   The agency did not cite what budget constraints compelled it to
cancel the program.
   The tug, or ``orbital maneuvering vehicle,'' was to have been a
remote-controlled, reusable spacecraft performing satellite service
and retrieval missions.
   In addition, NASA planned to have the vehicle periodically boost
the Hubble Space Telescope into a higher orbit around Earth.
   Begun in the 1980s, the project employed 280 people at TRW Inc.'s
Space &amp; Defense Sector facility in Redondo Beach, said company
spokeswoman Julie Meier Wright. The company's portion of the program
totaled $400 million.
   Workers will be reassigned at the facility, which employs 17,900
people, she said.

   Leaders of the Warsaw Pact say they want to change
the Soviet-led alliance from a military to a political body by this
fall, reflecting the reduced East-West tensions in Europe.
   After meeting Thursday in Moscow, the pact leaders declared their
``readiness for constructive cooperation'' with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   NATO foreign ministers, concluding two days of talks in Scotland,
today welcomed the statement by their longtime rival.
   ``We are ready to contribute actively to building confidence and
closer relations between all European countries, including the
members of the two alliances,'' a NATO statement said.
   Members of the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact alliance also discussed
various roles for a united Germany in Europe, said Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Yuli Kvitsinsky, but he indicated there was no
agreement.
   The members said they favor the formation of a new,
``all-European security system and the creation of a single Europe
of peace and cooperation,'' without artificial barriers and
``ideological hostility.''
   ``Participants in the meeting are unanimous in their opinion that
the ideological enemy image has been overcome by mutual efforts of
the East and the West,'' the declaration said.
   The Warsaw Pact meeting came as the old structure of the
35-year-old alliance is crumbling in the wake of last year's
democratic upheaval and the ouster of hard-line Communist regimes in
Eastern Europe.
   In light of the changes, it has become necessary ``to reconsider
the character and functions of the Warsaw Treaty,'' the members said
in their declaration.
   New proposals on such a transformation will be drawn up before
the end of October.
   Soviet and East European sources familiar with the thinking of
government leaders have said that the envisioned new structure of
the pact would be patterned roughly after the NATO secretariat and
council in Brussels, although no firm plans have been disclosed.
   Warsaw Pact members include Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union.
   The declaration said a commission will work out proposals on
transforming the alliance before the end of October, and the
Political Consultative Committee _ the group that met in Moscow
Thursday _ will examine them before the end of November.
   Despite statements before the meeting by Hungarian Prime Minister
Jozsef Antall that he wants to remove his country from the alliance,
Kvitsinsky said ``there wasn't a single statement made relating to a
wish to quit'' the pact.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, too, said upon returning to
Prague that he stressed that his country should remain in the pact
in order to oversee its transformation.
   Pact members also heard a detailed report by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on his Washington summit last week with
President Bush.
   Havel and his foreign minister, Jiri Dienstbier, also indicated
there was no agreement on future security arrangements for a united
Germany.
   The Soviets oppose NATO membership for a united Germany, and
Gorbachev and Bush failed to resolve their differences over the
issue last week.

   Black was the color of national Arts
Awareness Day at the Fuller Museum of Art.
   Staff members wore black Thursday, and they used a black band to
cordon off an exhibit of pieces loaned by Boston's Museum of Fine
Arts.
   The idea, they said, was to warn that the museum may not be able
to afford some exhibits if federal and state funds are cut back or
eliminated.
   The cordoned-off gallery, now showing classical furniture
borrowed from the Boston museum with money from the National
Endowment for the Arts, will be closed if grants stop, the museum
said.
   Fuller officials said the museum will have to cut its staff or
operating hours if its allocation from the Massachusetts Cultural
Council is cut from the $30,000 this year to $15,000 next year as
the Massachusetts House has recommended.
   ``We feel a sense of loss,'' said James Keneklis, director of the
Fuller. ``Our demonstration is in support of the NEA and a request
to Congress to renew its five-year term without limiting funding.''
   Bills have been introduced in Congress and the state Legislature
that would prevent the National Endowment for the Arts and the
Massachusetts Cultural Council from making grants to institutions
exhibiting art considered obscene or offensive.

   The top 30 floors of the Empire State Building
will be lit with lavender lights in honor of Gay Pride Weekend later
this month.
   The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said it has
lobbied the management of the 102-story-tall building for the past
six years to have the landmark building illuminated in honor of
their cause.
   ``Everybody is going to look up that weekend (June 22-24), gay
and straight, and they will see that New York City is recognizing
the existence of the gay and lesbian community,'' said Tom Lynch, a
member of GLAAD.
   Owners and managers of the building issued a statement on the
decision: ``We are in total agreement with ... leaders who seek to
end the bigotry and discrimination directed against gay and lesbian
New Yorkers. We hope our participating will help end the type of
ignorance that breeds this mindless prejudice.''
   Gay Pride Weekend includes the city's second largest parade,
which draws about 150,000 marchers.
   The 102-story building is illuminated in various colors
associated with specific holidays, such as red, white and blue for
the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Presidents' Day and Veterans Day, and
green on St. Patrick's Day.
   Lavender was chosen for Gay Pride Weekend because it is the
traditional color of the gay and lesbian movement.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Calls on Aoun to Step Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy urged rebel
Gen. Michel Aoun to step down and recognize the government set up
last year under an Arab League peace plan, a newspaper reported
today.
   The forces of Aoun and militia chieftain Samir Geagea skirmished
today with mortars and machine guns in East Beirut. Police said one
erson was wounded by sniper fire in the Ashrafiyeh district before
the exchange ended.
   The fighting violated a shaky cease-fire that was called May 17
to halt more than four months of intra-Christian clashes for
dominance of a tiny enclave northeast of Beirut.
   The power struggle between the rival Christian forces began Jan.
30 and has killed 1,036 people, wounded 2,772 and forced about 40
percent of the Christian enclave's 1 million population to flee
their homes.
   Th newspaper Ad-Diyar reported that McCarthy said he told
President Elias Hrawi in Cairo early this week of the U.S.
administration's ``support for the legal Lebanese authority to
enable it to carry out its responsibilities.''
   Hrawi was elected president Nov. 24 in line with an Arab
League-brokered peace accord to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
The peace plan was worked out by Lebanese legislators in the Saudi
resort of Taif in October.
   Aoun has rejected the Taif accord because it does not contain a
specific timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon,
and he has refused to recognize Hrawi as head of state.
   Geagea, who heads the Lebanese forces militia, has recognized
Hrawi's authority and voiced cautious support of the peace plan.
   ``The United States still supports the Taif accord and sees it as
a pressing need that Aoun should step down,'' McCarthy told Ad-Diyar.
   Aoun has refused to withdraw from the presidential palace in
Baabda, east of Beirut. Hrawi has been forced to set up headquarters
in Moslem west Beirut.
   ``I don't mean by stepping down that Aoun should leave Baabda
only. He also should recognize the legal authority and join the
national reconciliation march provided by the Taif accord,''
McCarthy said.
   McCarthy and his American staff evacuated the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut's northern suburb of Aoukar Sept. 6 after pro-Aoun youths
besieged the compound protesting alleged American opposition to
their leader.
   McCarthy met Hrawi in Cairo during an Arab tour by the Lebanese
president that also took him to Libya and Tunisia.
   Aoun's control of about 40 percent of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave has prevented Hrawi's Syrian-backed government
from spreading its authority to the disputed sector.
   McCarthy said continuation of the present situation in Lebanon
would lead to ``further fragmentation (of the nation),
inter-communal clashes and more refugees.''

   A man whose car door was flattened by a police
horse says it was the last straw when he got a ticket for
obstructing traffic.
   Kirk Hudson, 27, was parked at a meter in downtown Detroit on
Feb. 8 when he opened the driver's side door of his Honda Civic and,
``there was this blur of brown hair and a black boot going by and I
heard `crunch, pop,' and the hinge popped out of my door and the
door was flattened against the car.''
   Magistrate Thomas Shannon of 36th District Court dismissed
Hudson's $70 ticket Thursday after a police witness failed to appear.
   Hudson said his insurance company paid the $1,700 in damages,
calling it ``an act of God.''
   Hudson said Officer Paul Priemer, a member of the Detroit Police
Mounted Section, shouldn't have tried to ``skinny his horse,''
Ollie, between the cars.
   Priemer, who said Hudson should have looked more carefully, said
his boot and Ollie's chest got caught on the door.
   ``It scared me,'' Priemer said Thursday. ``It scared the horse.
Either this horse is powerful, or that door is real cheap.''

<HEAD>Pope Calls Ukrainian Summit Inviting Clandestine Bishops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since the Ukrainian
Catholic Church was banned more than four decades ago, its
clandestine bishops will meet with the pope later this month, it was
announced Friday.
   Pope John Paul II set the meeting for June 25-26 to discuss
efforts to legalize the church and recover its lost property, the
Vatican said in a statement.
   The 10 Ukrainian Catholic bishops living in the Soviet republic
will be joined by the 18 Ukrainian prelates living in the West, said
Rome-based Ukrainian Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky in a separate
statement.
   ``This will be the first meeting between the pope of the
universal church and the Ukrainian Catholic hierarchy from the
Ukraine since the Ukrainian church was liquidated ...in 1946,''
Lubachivsky said.
   The suppression was carried out by dictator Josef Stalin, who
forced the Ukrainian Catholics to merge with the Russian Orthodox
Church. Bishops and priests who resisted were shot or imprisoned.
   According to Western estimates, there are 4 million to 6 million
Catholics in the Ukraine. Until recently, they practiced their faith
clandestinely but in the past few years many have emerged to worship
openly and demand official recognition.
   The Ukrainian issue was one of the topics discussed when Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with John Paul in December in the
first visit of a Kremlim chief to the Vatican.
   Gorbachev pledged enactment of a law guaranteeing freedom of
conscience in the officially atheist country, which would pave the
way for legalization of the Ukrainian church. The bill is slowly
working its way through the Soviet legislature.
   Since Gorbachev's visit, the Ukrainians have regained many
churches and the faithful have been registering with authorities
parish by parish in anticipation of full legality.
   Lubachivsky said the 10 Ukrainian bishops were all consecrated
clandestinely. Only in the past two years have some of their names
been made public.
   Talks bringing together officials of the Vatican, the Ukrainian
and the Orthodox churches broke down in March when Ukrainian leaders
complained that Moscow was dragging its feet on the freedom of
religion law. But the Ukrainians have said they are prepared to go
back to the negotiating table.
   The return of church property is a major stumbling block because
the Orthodox stand to lose hundreds of churches they took over after
1946.
   The Vatican statement, issued by papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro,
said the Vatican hopes the meeting will ``contribute to the solution
of still existing difficulties in the Ukraine.''
   It referred to the Ukrainian Church as a ``meritorious'' church
that has given ``heroic testimony of its Catholic faith in
particularly difficult circumstances.''

<HEAD>AP Names Two New Special Correspondents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press today named two new special
correspondents, the wire service's top designation for its writers
and reporters. They are Tad Bartimus and Nancy Shulins.
   In the history of the AP, only 14 other AP staffers have been
designated special correspondent.
   ``Tad and Nancy join a special group of AP people whose talent
represents the best of the AP _ fine writing supported by intense
reporting, a combination that produces memorable news copy,'' said
Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the news
cooperative.
   Bartimus, 42, won the Associated Press Managing Editors Top
Performance Award in 1988 for her story about three young Missouri
brothers who drowned. The story also was a finalist in the Pulitzer
Prize feature category. She was one of a team of AP reporters who
covered the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, a state where she
earlier worked as AP's bureau chief.
   Shulins, 35, has written stories about such diverse topics as
women of the Ku Klux Klan, excessively aggressive children and the
Hmong people of Cambodia who resettled in the United States after
the Vietnam War. She earned a 1983 Clarion Award from Women in
Communications, Inc., for her KKK story.
   Bartimus, a native of Belton, Mo., joined the AP in Topeka, Kan.,
in 1969 following graduation from the University of Missouri. She
transferred to Miami later that year, and in 1973 went to Saigon to
cover the war in Southeast Asia.
   She was named correspondent in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1974, and
the following year became AP's first Alaska bureau chief.
   In 1977 Bartimus returned to the foreign service in London, where
she reported for two years. She then became a roving reporter
covering Central and South America during 1978-79. For that work,
she received a special Tom Wallace Award from the Inter American
Press Association, an award named for that organization's first U.S.
president.
   Later in 1979 she returned to Topeka and from there covered
stories in the Midwest and West. Her base of operations shifted to
Denver in 1981, and she was named Mountain States regional reporter
when the AP established a six-person team of regional writers in
1985.
   Shulins, a native of Hanover, N.H., began her AP career in
Montpelier, Vt., in 1976, after working as a reporter for the
Lebanon, N.H., Valley News. She was named correspondent in
Montpelier in 1978 and correspondent in Evansville, Ind., the
following year.
   Shulins became a member of the AP's national reporting team,
based in New York, in 1981, and the following year moved to AP
Newsfeatures, where she has written enterprise stories aimed at
Sunday newspapers.
   Bartimus and Shulins join six active AP special correspondents:
Vice President Walter R. Mears, who writes a poltical column from
Washington; Jules Loh, Hugh Mulligan and Saul Pett, all AP
Newsfeatures writers; Mort Rosenblum, based in Paris, and George
Esper, the AP's New England regional reporter based in Boston.
   The other special correspondents were: photographer Eddie Adams,
now a free lancer; Peter Arnett, now with CNN; Will Grimsley and
John Roderick, both retired, and the late John Hightower, Relman
Morin, William L. Ryan and Don Whitehead.

<DATELINE>BIJBIARA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Moslem militants shot and killed the
uncle of India's home minister at his home in the disputed Kashmir
Valley, authorities said today.
   Ghulam Hassan Shah, an uncle of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad
Sayeed, was killed Thursday night in Bijbiara, 25 miles southeast of
Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state and a stronghold
of Moslem secessionists.
   Shah was one of several relatives whom Sayeed had evacuated to
New Delhi last winter, fearing they would be targeted by Moslem
militants seeking independence for Jammu-Kashmir.
   Shah, 62, returned to Bijbiara a week ago because of his concern
for the well-being of a son who had stayed behind, according to the
neighbors who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sayeed's daughter, Rubaiya, was kidnapped by Moslem separatists
in Srinagar in December and held hostage for six days until the
government freed five members of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Shah's slaying.
   Neighbors said he was killed by militants who came to his house
about 9 p.m. Thursday. A similar account was given by a state police
spokesman in Jammu, the state's winter capital.
   A retired state tax officer, Shah was especially close to Sayeed,
one of the most prominent Moslems in Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
government.
   The kidnapping of Sayeed's daughter shortly after Singh took
office spurred new government tactics in Kashmir, culminating in a
harsh military crackdown on the escalating Moslem separatist
movement.
   At least 504 people have been killed in Kashmir since the
crackdown started Jan. 20. The majority have been Moslem militants
and their supporters slain by Indian security forces.
   The crackdown has sparked tensions between India and Pakistan,
which has supported its fellow Moslems in Jammu-Kashmir.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in predominantly Hindu India with
a Moslem majority. About 64 percent of the 6 million inhabitants are
Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems make up only 12 percent of India's 880
million people, while Hindus account for 82 percent.

   Barbara Bush marked her 65th birthday today
doing what she loves best: pushing literacy and reading aloud to
children.
   Seated amid about a dozen children on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America'' show, the white-haired first lady read the story ``Leo,
the Late Bloomer,'' about a lion who was slow to learn to read and
write, and was rewarded with a chorus of ``Happy Birthday, Mrs.
Bush.''
   ``Oh, how'd you know?'' she asked. ``Who told you that secret?
Thank you very, very much.''
   President Bush telephoned birthday wishes to his wife today from
Iowa, wrapping up a four-state political trip.
   ``I did talk to Barbara this morning. She seemed unexcited about
her 65th birthday,'' he said. Later, the National Pork Producers'
Council gave Bush a a box of pork chops and several bags of pork
rinds, a favorite snack.
   ``Maybe that's what I'll give to Barbara for her birthday
present,'' he quipped.
   Mrs. Bush said Thursday she ``couldn't care less'' about the
milestone.
   Reading to children, Mrs. Bush said, is ``about the most
important thing parents can do.''
   She cited studies finding that children who were read to at home
do better in school, and said she and her husband read regularly to
their children when they were young.
   ``It was a chance for us to put an arm around a child and have a
special time,'' she said. ``It does a lot for bonding with your
children and it pays off later.''
   Mrs. Bush, a longtime crusader for literacy, planned to read
again later to second graders at a library in nearby District
Heights, Md.
   President Bush, in a political fund-raising speech in Chicago on
Thursday, said he had just been on the phone with ``tomorrow's
birthday girl, the one who did so well at Wellesley'' College in her
commencement speech there last week.
   As she left an event honoring children who read hundreds of books
to raise money for the March of Dimes, Mrs. Bush groaned when asked
about her birthday.
   ``Ohhhhhh!'' she said, as if hammered by a verbal blow. But she
quickly added with a laugh: ``I couldn't care less. No, I have no
feelings about it.''
   She is coming off perhaps the most celebrated event in her 15
months in the White House: last week's televised commencement
address at Wellesley with her Soviet counterpart, Raisa Gorbachev,
at her side.
   The first lady's speech was made more dramatic by a student
protest beforehand questioning whether George Bush's homemaker wife
was a suitable role model for the graduates of the elite,
career-driven college.
   But Mrs. Bush, with liberal doses of wit and candid advice about
putting family ahead of job advancements, won cheers for her speech.
Crowds in Wellesley gave a tumultuous welcome to both first ladies.
   ``I had a very good week, and I plan to have a great week next
week, too,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters.
   ``I felt all of America had a great week last week,'' she said,
reflecting on the recent superpower summit.
   ``I was really proud of the Wellesley girls and Boston,'' she
said. ``I was really proud that we could show Raisa that kind of
(welcome). The only problem was she wanted to thank each one
personally.''
   Mrs. Bush draped ribbons around the necks of local March of
Dimes' ``reading champions.'' The top reader was Nicholas Daly, 9,
of Beltsville, Md., who read 435 books in a single month.
   The drive raised more than $14,000 to warn women about the
dangers of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes during pregnancy.
   Mrs. Bush, saluting the youngsters at a ceremony at The
Washington Post, said, ``You've shown us once again that everyone,
no matter how old or young, or how small their allowance, everyone
has something very precious to share with others.
   ``Because you've been willing to share your precious ability to
read, our babies will be born into a brighter world,'' she said.
   President Bush, who turns 66 next Tuesday, was in Des Moines,
Iowa, today bound for Omaha, Neb., before returning to the White
House this evening for dinner with Mrs. Bush and visiting West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Mrs. Bush has two more commencement speeches to give: one at
Kennebunk High School in Maine on Sunday and the other at Dunbar
High School in Washington next week.
   She was born June 8, 1925, in New York City.

   Thomas R. Sheridan, a prominent trial lawyer
who served as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy, has died of a heart attack at age 60.
   Born in Boston, Sheridan graduated from Catholic University in
Washington, and earned a law degree at the University of California,
Los Angeles.
   He began his career as a trial attorney in the Justice
Department's antitrust division and later headed the criminal
division of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.
   Kennedy, then attorney general, appointed Sheridan his special
assistant in 1962.
   In 1965, Sheridan was named general counsel and executive
director of the McCone Commission, created to investigate what set
off rioting in the Watts area of Los Angeles and to make
recommendations to avoid future violence.
   Sheridan entered private practice in 1965. Among his clients was
C. Arnhold Smith, a San Diego millionaire who was convicted in 1975
of making illegal campaign contributions.
   Survivors include four sons, two brothers, two sisters and two
grandsons.

<HEAD>Court: Feds Can't Seize Drug Property From Unwitting Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANTOWN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seizure of a 4,600-acre ranch used as
a landing field by drug traffickers has been reversed by a federal
appeals court, which ordered the property returned to the innocent
owner.
   When marshals moved against the Tucker Ranch east of Lake
Okeechobee in September 1988, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen hailed
it as part of the largest drug-related propety seizure in the nation.
   But the Tucker family vigorously fought the action, saying they
had no way of knowing their tenant, Frank Brady, was using the land
for illegal purposes. On Wednesday the seizure was dismissed by the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Robert T. Godley, a senior vice president for the First Union
National Bank of Florida, the current trustee for the property,
applauded the decision.
   ``It's been very tough,'' Godley said. ``In our quest to end the
drug problem in this country, laws are being passed and citizens are
being denied their civil rights. We were guilty until proven
innocent. It's a bit of anarchy.''
   No one disputed the ranch was used as an airstrip by Brady, a
Medellin drug cartel smuggler who was sentenced to 10 years in
prison in 1986. Brady flew marijuana into the country from the
Bahamas; at one point, he was listed as one of the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted.
   But Brady only rented part of the ranch, and the Tucker family,
which was never implicated in the case, said it was unfairly
penalized.
   Their attorney, Edward A. Marod, argued the owners had done
everything possible to prevent illegal activity on their land short
of sealing it from the air with barbed wire.
   In August 1989, Miami U.S. District Judge Edward Davis sided with
the Tuckers. The judge ruled he was unwilling to require majority
shareholders to walk thousands of acres ``to assure themselves that
no illegal activity is taking place.''
   The U.S. attorney's office appealed Davis' decision. Last week,
however, it reversed its stand and asked for the dismissal.
Lehtinen's office had no immediate comment on the case.
   The dismissal clears the way for a sale arranged more than a year
ago. Martin County property records show the land is worth about
$7.3 million.
   Federal law enforcement officials defend their practice of
seizing property used for drug smuggling and called it ``one of the
most effective tools in the war on drugs.''
   ``If a landowner allows drug smuggling on his property, people
have to just face that the consequences can be devastating,'' said
Paul Miller, spokesman for the FBI in Miami.

   A state of emergency was declared in eastern
Uzbekistan today because of ethnic warfare over the distribution of
plots of land, and the president of the republic asked the Kremlin
to help settle the conflict.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said five days of clashes between
ethnic Uzbeks and Kirghiz in Kirghizia have left at least 78 people
dead and 330 wounded.
   On Thursday, dozens of people in Uzbekistan crossed into
neighboring Kirghizia, and one person was killed and 33 injured in
fights, a Soviet Interior Ministry spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Uzbek President Islam Karimov declared the state of emergency for
the region near the Kirghiz border and sent an urgent telegram to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warning that the violence could cause
open conflict between the two republics, Tass said.
   Karimov called on the Kremlin to dispatch a government
commission, headed by a member of the Politburo and including
deputies of the Supreme Soviet legislature, to assist in ending the
strife.
   A state of emergency already is in effect in the Kirghiz border
city of Osh, where the fighting broke out on Monday, and in
Kirghizia's capital, Frunze.
   Residents of the two densely populated Soviet republics have been
fighting each other in a dispute over the allocation of plots of
land.
   The Interior Ministry spokesman said more than 3,000 Kirghiz
youths in Frunze demanded today to be allowed to go to Osh, 195
miles south.
   Tass quoted Col. Felix Kulov as saying the situation remained
tense near Osh.
   The area is closed to Western correspondents, and official
accounts of the unrest and the death toll have been sketchy.
   Tass said thousands of police and soldiers have been sent into
the region. On Thursday, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told
lawmakers in Moscow that 1,500 soldiers, 900 police and Interior
Ministry troops and 450 border guards were in Kirghizia in an
attempt to quell the fighting.
   Authorities declared the emergency in Frunze after cars were
destroyed and thousands of people surrounded Communist Party and
government buildings.
   The protesters demanded the resignation of the republic's leaders
within three days and urged Kirghiz to unite and strike back at
Uzbeks, Tass reported.
   Tass said 249 houses and 40 cars had been burned in the fighting
and that police had confiscated 79 guns.
   The sequence of events in Kirghizia has been similar to other
outbreaks in past months in the heavily populated, poverty-stricken
region of Central Asia: a local dispute _ in this case, conflicting
claims by Kirghiz and Uzbeks to private plots _ unleashing pent-up
fury between the ethnic groups.
   The Uzbeks and the Kirghiz are predominantly Sunni Moslem ethnic
groups that speak different Turkic dialects.
   Abdurakhim Pulatov, one of the leaders of the Uzbek popular
movement, Berlik, said Thursday that refugees were ``telling
horrible stories about how Kirghiz are destroying the Uzbek
population.''
   He said Berlik and the Uzbek government were trying to appeal to
Uzbeks in Kirghizia to defuse the crisis, but added, ``It's hard
because the people are already in the streets. This should have been
done a week ago.''

   Some of the world's top physicists savored the
possibility today of making the ``Siberian snake concept'' and
shooting subatomic particles underground to Arkansas with the
planned superconducting super collider.
   Somewhat like selecting options for a new family car, members of
an advisory committee are soliciting project suggestions for the
atom smasher, scheduled to be built south of Dallas. Fourteen groups
representing more than 1,500 scientists began their presentations
Thursday and continued today.
   ``Some of the best physicists in the world are obviously eager to
go,'' said Roy F. Schwitters, director of the SCC laboratory.
   When completed, the 53-mile particle accelerator is expected to
confirm many theories about matter and energy while disproving
others.
   Murdock Gilchriese, of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, in
Berkeley, Calif., said the competition that opened Thursday is
exciting for those involved because it brings them so much closer to
the work they believe will reap great discoveries.
   ``It's essentially the same reason people climb mountains _ to
see what's over the hills,'' Gilchriese said.
   Schwitters said that completion is at least eight years away,
adding that it's ``too soon to say'' how much the total cost will
be. Current estimates are about $8 billion.
   The project passed a critical test Thursday when a House
subcommittee in Washington unanimously accepted the White House's
spending recommendation of $318 million for the super collider.
   The experimental programs being touted in Dallas by
representatives of the 14 groups not only included recommendations
for possible experiments, but concepts for detectors that can record
results of experiments.
   More than 100 people, including many of the world's leading
physicists, listened as the presentations unfolded Thursday. The
proposals will be evaluated by the advisory committee during the
summer and the fall. The committee will make its recommendations
Nov. 1-3.
   Alan Krisch of the University of Michigan led off Thursday with a
pitch to include spin-correcting devices in the collider. He
stressed the importance of considering the rotation of the protons
as they are shot at around the giant ring.
   Under the proposal from Krisch's group, a series of eight
half-meter-long magnets would be placed every 3 kilometers. At each
point, the magnets would force protons to flip over 180 degrees.
   ``Whatever imperfections there are in the facility would cancel
each other out,'' explained Krisch.
   The technique is called the ``Siberian snake concept,'' and one
of its creators, Y. Derbenev of the Soviet Union, will soon be
conducting research at Ann Arbor, Mich., alongside Krisch.
   Another group wants $150 million to search for the Higgs
particle, which has eluded scientists so far. Group spokesman Dick
Lander said the particle's attributes have been predicted by many,
including namesake Peter Higgs, and the super conductor has been
designed to be large enough to find one.
   ``If it exists, it should show up as a particle that decays into
four other particles. It's almost guaranteed the way the theory is
written that we'll find it,'' he said. ``If we can't find it, the
theory can't survive.''
   Lander said a planned accelerator in Europe also was designed to
be large enough to look for the Higgs particle.
   ``It's a race for the Higgs,'' he said.
   Michael Lieber of the University of Arkansas said his group wants
the committee to consider equipping the super collider with the
capability of shooting a stream of neutrinos to Arkansas.
   ``They would shoot 20 billion billion neutrinos per pulse, and we
would stop about a million of those,'' Lieber said of a planned
neutrino detector 200 meters in diameter. It would be placed in a
lake near Hot Springs, Ark.
   The experiment would try to determine if and how neutrinos change
as they travel. Lieber said scientists ultimately would like to know
why only about a third of the neutrinos shot earthward from the sun
actually make it here.

   Gang members returning from a friend's funeral

Thursday shooting, Sgt. Bob James said.
   James said no arrests were made immediately, but the limousines

   A federal jury rejected a convicted bank
robber's lawsuit for $10 million in damages from injuries she
suffered in a shootout with police after she and her boyfriend
pulled off the heist.
   The U.S. District Court jury deliberated less than three hours
Thursday before exonerating four members of an elite police unit in
the Sept. 15, 1982 shooting of Jane Berry.
   Assistant City Attorney Victoria Chaney called the verdict ``a
signal to other people that they should think carefully about filing
lawsuits against police officers who place their lives on the line
every day dealing with very dangerous situations.''
   Berry, 43, had sought $10 million in damages in her civil rights
suit against members of the Special Investigations Section. She is
serving a 15-year sentence in state prison.
   Berry testified she never heard police order her to freeze after
she and her boyfriend, John Crumpton III, robbed a Security Pacific
Bank branch in Burbank. She also disputed officers' claims that she
reached for her gun moments before she was shot.
   Crumpton, 33, died of 38 bullet and shotgun pellet wounds. Berry
received 14 shotgun and pellet wounds.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today announced
the formation of a new right-wing government that pledged to
``uproot'' the Palestinian uprising and expand Jewish settlements in
the occupied territories. A leading Palestinian activist immediately
criticized the new coalition's policies, calling them ``obstacles in
the way of peace.''
   Shimon Peres, leader of the rival left-center Labor Party,
predicted the coalition would be beset by infighting.
   Today's coalition agreement would give Shamir 62 votes in the
120-member Knesset, where a vote approving the government could come
as early as Monday.
   Shamir's announcement came after he signed an agreement with a
string of far-right and religious factions, plus a defector from the
Labor Party.
   The formation of the new government, the first to be fully
controlled by Shamir's Likud bloc since 1984, breaks a 3-month-old
political deadlock.
   Close election results since 1984 had forced Likud and Labor into
power-sharing arrangements, but ideological differences often
paralyzed political action.
   A Likud-Labor ``unity'' government fell apart March 15 in
disagreements between the two parties over whether to take part in
U.S.-proposed peace talks with Palestinians.
   After the government's collapse, Peres failed in a 35-day effort
to form a left-leaning government.
   As legally required, Shamir telephoned President Chaim Herzog to
report the formation of the new coaltion.
   The announcement came only hours before his 42-day mandate for
forming a government ran out at sundown with the beginning of the
Jewish Sabbath.
   The new government's expected hard line on the 30-month-old
Palestinian uprising and its plans to push for more settlements of
Jews in the occupied lands were likely to exacerbate tensions with
the United States.
   Washington has been urging Israel to make concessions to
Palestinians to revive the stalled peace process.
   On the uprising, the coalition pledged to ``to uproot the
phenomenon of violence and disturbances and create tranquility in
all parts of Israel.''
   Faisal Husseini, a leading pro-PLO activist in the occupied
lands, said after the announcement: ``We believe the next few months
will be hard ones.''
   ``There will be more obstacles in the way of peace,'' he said.
   The new coalition's policy guidelines oppose the formation of a
Palestinian state and renew Israel's refusal to talk with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   They insist on the right of Jews to settle in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, saying the government will ``act to strengthen,
expand and develop the settlements.''
   Arab countries have claimed that Israel will settle many of the
thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Ariel Sharon, a leading right-wing figure, was reported to be in
line to become housing minister and thus would be in charge of the
settling of Soviet immigrants. After the announcement, Sharon was
asked about settling Soviets in the territories.
   ``Israel is a democratic country. Everyone can settle where he
wants,'' he replied.
   Peres said on Israel radio that opposing views of the many
coalition partners were likely to split the new government.
   ``Most of the time and energy will be spent in holding it
together instead of advancing the state,'' he said.
   The delicate coalition bargaining involved a number of small
parties, each with different views. The lengthy bickering raised
demands for political reform to end the system under which tiny
parties hold the balance of power.
   Shamir, asked if Cabinet posts had been assigned, replied: ``Not
yet.''
   But reports said Likud hard-liners would be in charge at the key
ministries. Israel army radio said Housing Minister David Levy would
become foreign minister and the present foreign minister, Moshe
Arens, would be defense minister.
   Besides Likud, the coalition partners include three right-wing
parties, three religious ones, two one-man factions and lawmaker
Ephraim Gur, who quit the Labor Party on Thursday.
   News reports had suggested Shamir would have preferred a
coalition with Labor, but he said on army radio he did not expect
the rival party to join the new government now.
   ``At this stage it is not realistic,'' he said.
   In the last election in November 1988, Likud won 40 seats and
Labor 39, forcing them into a so-called National Unity Government.
Shamir alluded to that failed government as he announced the
formation of the new coalition.
   ``I pray that national unity will exist in this government that
we are forming today and that all of us will act together ... for
the Israeli people and the land of Israel,'' he said.
   Radio reports said the government's guidelines include various
promises to meet demands of the small partners.
   One promise, intended to satisfy ultra-Orthodox parties, says the
government will press to outlaw the sale of pork in Israel in line
with Jewish dietary strictures.

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III today said Washington is seeking more information on a foiled
Palestinian raid along the Israeli coast before deciding whether to
cut off talks with the PLO.
   Last week's attempted raid ``has to be taken very seriously,''
Baker said, but he added that ``some perspective and responsibility
is required in dealing with the issue.''
   Baker, responding to reports that a cutoff in talks was imminent,
told reporters the talks are continuing while the administration
seeks to find out ``all we need to know'' about the circumstances.
He declined to say what information was still lacking.
   Baker made his comments during a news conference at the
conclusion of a two-day NATO foreign ministers meeting in Turnberry.
   Israel and some U.S. lawmakers have demanded that the Bush
administration break off the 16-month-old direct contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organization because its chairman, Yasser
Arafat, has refused to condemn the attempted raid by a PLO faction
on May 30.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in a separate news
conference, said ``a break in the dialogue would be a real setback''
to peace efforts in the Middle East. ``I am very keen that he
(Baker) and the U.S. administration should remain directly engaged.
That is crucially important.''
   But Hurd also urged Arafat to be ``more precise and specific'' in
condemning the attempted raid.
   Israeli forces foiled the raid on the beaches of Tel Aviv and the
Palestine Liberation Front, a wing of the PLO, claimed
responsibility.
   The attack followed the slaying 10 days earlier of seven
Palestinian laborers by an Israeli the government described as
deranged.
   Since then, the Bush administration has weighed whether to
suspend the talks with the PLO that in December 1988 after Arafat
renounced terrorism.

   Japanese Ambassador Toshio Isogai was killed
when his car hit a utility pole while apparently trying to avoid a
cow that had strayed onto a road, embassy officials said today. He
was 62.
   The accident occurred late Thursday night near the town of
Sigatoka, in the west of the main island, Viti Levu, the officials

   The embassy said the ambassador's wife, Toshiko, was not injured.
The couple's personal chef, Takashi Tabata, suffered a broken leg.
   Isogai was born Aug. 24, 1927, in Okayama in western Japan. He
graduated from the Agriculture-Fisheries College of Tokyo University
in 1953 and entered the Foreign Ministry in 1956.
   He served as consul general at the Japanese Consulate in Seattle
from December 1982 to December 1986, when he was named ambassador to
Fiji.
   In addition to his wife, Isogai is survived by a son.

   Nelson Mandela said today that South Africa will
one day need massive Western financial aid to help its people but
that economic sanctions should be maintained until the white
government scraps apartheid.
   The black nationalist leader, who underwent surgery last week to
have a benign cyst removed, canceled a morning meeting with Red
Cross officials due to fatigue, a Red Cross spokeswoman said.
   However, Mandela, who turns 72 next month, spoke later to the
International Labor Organization.
   ``Given the fact that apartheid has not ended, it is only logical
that we should continue this weapon of struggle,'' Mandela, deputy
president of the African National Congress, told the annual meeting
of the 150-nation U.N. body.
   In the future, he said, the South Africa economy will need
``massive international intervention if we are to move forward at a
pace that recognized the urgency of the needs of our people.''
   Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, concluded
his speech by talking of a ``glorious vision of South Africa free of
racism ... no longer the skunk of the world.''
   Mandela says other countries should not lift their restrictions
on trade and investment to South Africa despite an announcement
Thursday by South African President F.W. de Klerk to drop repressive
state of emergency measures in three of the nation's four provinces.
   The apartheid system still deprives the nation's 28 million
blacks of a say in the government, while the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate services.
   Mandela received a thunderous ovation from more than 2,000
delegates crowding the assembly hall of the United Nations
headquarters in Geneva. The International Labor Organization
expelled South Africa 25 years ago because of its racial policies.
   The organization sets international standards for working
conditions, but the standards are non-binding and must be ratified
by individual governments.
   Mandela canceled a morning visit to the International Committee
of the Red Cross because of ``fatigue,'' a Red Cross spokeswoman
said.
   Catherine Pelissier said Mandela had been due to hold private
talks with Red Cross chief Cornelio Sommaruga.
   However, Mandela kept a lunch appointment at the International
Labor Organization and was expected to address the World Council of
Churches later.
   Mandela is on a six-week trip to Europe and North America. He
will stay in Switzerland throughout the weekend before continuing to
West Germany.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that NATO
and the Warsaw Pact alliances should be cooperating with each other
in the same way that European leaders from both blocs have been in
close contact.
   ``If the leaders of the governments cooperate on the political
level, these organizations can't stand aside from their
governments,'' he said at a joint news conference with visiting
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she did not think the time was right for a
system of all-European security _ a plan that would end the division
of Europe into competing military alliances.
   Gorbachev said he differed with Mrs. Thatcher on this poit.
   ``One can have the policy that will resemble an elephant in a
china store: One move to the left smashes half of the store. A move
to the right smashes the other half,'' he said. ``If this is the
policy we choose, I don't envy us.''
   Both alliances were created to provide security, he said.
   ``In the period of the Cold War, they reached this using one
method,'' the Soviet leader said. ``In the period of the
construction of the common European home, they should use other
methods.''
   Earlier, aides to Mrs. Thatcher said that after her consultations
with Gorbachev, she felt increasingly confident that the East-West
standoff over Germany would be resolved ``without ultimatums or
deadlines.''
   The leaders discussed a nine-point U.S. proposal aimed at easing
Soviet concerns about a united Germany belonging to the NATO
alliance, said British officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The plan would allow Soviet troops to remain temporarily in what
is now East Germany and keep Western forces out.
   ``The prime minister felt encouraged,'' the British official
said. ``The whole issue of East-West relations is evolving. ...
People have not adopted fixed positions.''
   As he greeted Mrs. Thatcher in his office at the Kremlin,
Gorbachev said he still felt jet-lagged from his U.S. visit.
   ``Yesterday, I almost fell asleep during the Warsaw Treaty
meeting,'' he joked, referring to a summit meeting in Moscow of the
now dying Warsaw Pact, the military alliance of the Soviet Union and
its former Communist allies.
   But Thatcher aides said that during the 2{-hour private talks
before lunch, Gorbachev showed no sign of weariness or despondency
over his mounting domestic problems.
   ``He was cheerful, ebullient and confident throughout,'' said a
British official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Thatcher arrived Thursday at the start of a four-day visit.
   She was to hold separate talks later today with Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Defense Minister Dmitry T. Yazov.
   She and Gorbachev met as both the Warsaw Pact and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization wrestled with the need to find new
roles.
   At a meeting in Moscow Thursday, the seven-nation Warsaw Pact
said it needed to transform itself into a political body and sought
``constructive cooperation'' with the 16-member Western alliance.
   NATO foreign miisters met Thursday and today in Scotland, also
trying to work out new stances before a special summit meeting in
London in July.
   Both the East and West blocs are seeking to increase the role of
the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as a
new pan-European forum. It comprises all the countries of Europe,
except Albania, as well as the United States and Canada.
   Mrs. Thatcher leaves Moscow Saturday to visit a British trade and
cultural exhibition in the Ukraine capital, Kiev. On Sunday she goes
to a part of Armenia that was devastated by an earthquake 18 months
ago.

   Cleanup crews labored to corral blobs of oil
floating on the waters of the Kill Van Kull today after officials
arrested the first mate of the British-operated tanker that spewed
260,000 gallons of heavy oil.
   Authorities charged the first mate of the 811-foot tanker BT
Nautilus with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol or
drugs.
   The Kill Van Kull and the Arthur Kill, a second shipping channel
between New Jersey and New York, have had four major oil spills this

shortly after the accident at 5:15 a.m. Thursday contained nearly
all of the No. 6 heating oil in the normally busy channel, which
remained closed indefinitely.
   About 300 workers, including 50 sailors, and six vessels from the
Coast Guard, resumed cleanup operations this morning. Five skimmer
boats cruised the channel collecting oil, and a special Coast Guard
strike team brought in 10 small boats for maneuvering in small coves.
   Football-sized blobs were found as far away as the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, about three nautical miles from the spot
where the tanker struck bottom as it was docking, said Coast Guard
Lt. Cmdr. Paul A. Milligan.
   Oil leaked for about five hours from one of the tanker's 10
1.2-million-gallon holds, the Coast Guard said. Divers found a gash
about 30 feet long and 12 to 16 inches wide in the ship's No. 4
tank, but the Coast Guard had not determined the cause of the
rupture late Thursday night.
   New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio called the spill ``inexcusable,''
saying it indicates that ``something is dramatically wrong with the
way the petrochemical industry does business.''
   The first mate, Gregory Frederick Geoffrey, 52, of Merkse,
England, was released on $50,000 bail from police custody in Bayonne
Thursday night. He pleaded innocent to state charges of operating a
vessel under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and negligent
discharge of a pollutant without a permit.
   Urine tests were conducted for the ship's captain, identified by
the Coast Guard today as Albert Ainscough, and the harbor pilot
brought aboard for docking. Coast Guard officials had no further
information about the crew.
   Christopher Florentz, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert J.
Del Tufo, could not say if Gregory used drugs or alcohol, or what
led to his arrest about 4 p.m. Thursday.
   ``I believe he was the spotter, so he was up front,'' Florentz
said. But Geoffrey's lawyer, Richard F.X. Regan, said the first
mate's responsibility during docking was to remain on the
forecastle, not to act as spotter.
   ``It appears that my client is really a scapegoat ... for what
appears to be an accident,'' Regan said.
   The Coast Guard said the cleanup team included guardsmen from
Mobile, Ala., who were deployed on skimmer boats and vacuum truckers
to shovel, rake and sop up the oil. About 27,000 feet of floating
booms were already on the water.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Rybacki said the tanker owner,
Nautilus Motor Tanker of Gibraltar, has assumed responsibility for
the cleanup. The tanker is operated by Bulk Tanker Management of
London and registered in Hong Kong.

   A judge's obscenity ruling against a 2 Live Crew rap
album has no legal effect outside south Florida, where a record
store owner was arrested today, but civil libertarians see a
practical effect spreading nationally.
   ``This does pose a real threat that the amount of obscenity
actions may increase around the country,'' New York attorney Floyd
Abrams, a First Amendment expert, said Thursday. ``It is a direct
threat to freedom of expression in the arts, as well as in music in
particular.''
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday that the lyrics
of the Miami group's sexually explicit album ``As Nasty As They Want
To Be'' are obscene, leaving area retailers liable for arrest for
sales of the platinum-selling record.
   Today, a Fort Lauderdale area record store owner was arrested on
an obscenity charge after selling the album. Broward County
sheriff's deputies arrested E-C Records owner Charles Freeman at his
store less than three hours after he received a shipment of 25
copies.
   ``America is free, free for everybody,'' Freeman said. ``And as
long as this is America and I'm not living in Cuba, I feel my rights
are violated.''
   An undercover officer went in to buy copies of the record and
tape, then uniformed officers entered the store to make the arrest.
   ``I would have to say that the research and the consultation that
we were doing has apparently been concluded and we're prepared to
enforce it,'' sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal said minutes after
the arrest.
   Before authorities arrived, Freeman said he had sold all but six
copies of the recording. He said a line had formed outside the shop
in anticipation of the shipment's arrival.
   ``I'll go to jail, and I'll come back and sell it again,'' he
said before deputies arrived. ``I opened up a record store three
years ago expecting to sell records and this was the furthest thing
from my mind.''
   Asked why he would challenge the ban, Freeman explained: ``I'm a
small independent. All my money is going to be made on R&amp;B and rap,
so it'll hurt me in the long run.''
   The recording industry generally favors warning stickers on album
covers to bring attention to lyrics that some might consider
objectionable.
   But Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, said he hoped the specter of censorship
raised by the Fort Lauderdale ruling would act as a unifying force.
   ``This ruling, alongside the chilling lyrics legislation which is
making the rounds through the statehouses nationwide, must serve as
a call to mobilize all who value basic artistic freedom and who are
willing to tenaciously fight for the protection of First Amendment
rights,'' Greene said.
   Bruce Jesse, vice president of advertising and sales promotion
for the 265-store Wherehouse record store chain based in Los
Angeles, concluded, ``You're putting the retailer at a significant
risk.''
   But Bruce Fein, former counsel general of the Federal
Communications Commission, saw a limited impact, saying, ``I don't
think this sets a nationwide precedent that will cause all off-color
rock music to be banned.''
   Supplies of 2 Live Crew's disputed record dried up in South
Florida as the obscenity case was argued, but the decision is widely
expected to boost sales elsewhere.
   ``The lesson of history has always been, if you tell people you
can't have anything, they want it all the more,'' said Nova
University law professor Bruce Rogow. He represented 2 Live Crew in
its lawsuit against Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro over his
threat to prosecute retailers.
   The decision had no effect on the group's plans for two shows
Saturday night at Club Futura in nearby Hollywood.
   Club owner Kenneth Gerringer told City Council members Thursday
that the opening show would be a tame performance for all age
groups, and he would ask the rappers to shun explicit lyrics in the
later adults-only show.
   Ten uniformed police officers will be working inside and outside
the club, primarily for crowd control, said Paul Dungan,
administrative assistant to the police chief, who was out of town.
   ``We're handling this as if Michael Jackson were coming to town,
or Dean Martin or any of the top stars,'' he said. ``I would not
advise officers to go up on the stage and arrest four people in
front of 1,000 people.''
   But Mayor Sal Oliveri gave Gerringer a stern warning to pass
along to 2 Live Crew, saying, ``Artist or no artist, I don't want
Hollywood to have the reputation, in my opinion, that we have
obscene entertainment.''

<BYLINE>Former Church Treasurer Denies Wrongdoing

<TEXT>
   Clyde Womer says he wasn't trying to hide _ not
from the police, not from the wife and five children he abandoned,
not from his past.
   If he had been trying to hide, the fugitive New York church
treasurer says he would never have lived in Taos.
   This village in the mountains of northern New Mexico _ 3,700
people in the town limits and another 6,000 on the outskirts _ is a
major tourist mecca. Its streets are clogged already with swarms of
summer visitors marveling at the azure sky, bright sunshine, some 80
art galleries, historic Indian Pueblo and shops, all sculpted in
adobe.
   It was tourism that did Clyde Womer in.
   A visitor from New York wandered into the J.C. Penney store on
Taos' main street and recognized Womer as the man who police say
fled Suffern, N.Y., eight years ago with $267,000 from Christ Church
of Ramapo, N.Y.
   He was to be returned to New York today to face charges of grand
larceny brought in 1982 by a Rockland County grand jury. He's to be
arraigned Monday.
   Womer was known here as Lawrence ``Howie'' Krantz. He often
visited the J.C. Penney store managed by his second wife, Betty
Sutton.
   He strolled the town plaza, where ``He'd always strike up
conversations with the police,'' police Officer Gabriel Medina said.
   ``We've had a wonderful time here,'' Womer said Thursday in an
interview at the Taos County Jail. ``I had nothing to fear. I went
everywhere, did everything.''
   The bearded, gray-haired Womer acknowledged transferring money
from church accounts to his own accounts. He said he did so for
reasons he cannot disclose, but he denied stealing the funds.
   He said he felt all right about leaving his wife and children
because after years of commuting into New York City, he had become
estranged from them.
   ``I was the outsider. I was ready to leave,'' he said.
   He said he committed only two crimes: applying for a New Mexico
driver's license under a name that wasn't his own and committing
bigamy.
   ``I'm sorry for the hurt that I've caused other people,'' he said.
   Ms. Sutton refused to be interviewed, saying only, ``I've had a
bomb dropped this week.'' Taos police say she apparently knew
nothing of his past and faces no charges.
   She said Wednesday she was aware the man she knew as Krantz had
been married before and had five children but that she had been told
his first wife died of cancer. The two married in 1984.
   Suffern police detective Sgt. Leo Costa, who was in Taos, said
Womer's first wife now lives in Colorado Springs, about 200 miles to
the north, and her children are grown.
   He said she was upset when she learned he was married in New
Mexico. Costa said she had been in the process of filing papers to
declare her husband dead so she could receive Social Security.
   The Rev. John Andrews, rector of the Episcopalian church in
Suffern, flew to New Mexico to identify Womer. He said the day Womer
disappeared he discovered Womer wrote two checks totaling $165,000
on church accounts.
   He said he had personality conflicts with Womer and had wanted
him relieved as treasurer but had no idea money was missing.

   A veterinarian employed by the Ministry

animal rights groups.
   The explosion occurred Wednesday as Margaret Baskerville, who
works for the Chemical Defense Establishment, was backing her car
away from her home at Winterslow, a suburb of Salisbury.
   ``It has now been established the explosion was caused by a
device fitted underneath the vehicle,'' Inspector Graham Chivers of

   No group claimed responsibility.
   The Chemical Defense Establishment uses animals _ primarily mice
and guinea pigs _ in tests of protective measures against chemical

   President Bush said today that despite
improving relations between the United States and Soviet Union, ``we
cannot lose sight of the differences that remain between our two
countries.''
   He heralded ``the beginning of the end of the Cold War'' in the
wake of his summit meeting last week with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   But one problem that will not be ``solved quickly or easily'' is
the future of a unified Germany, Bush said before heading home from
a Midwest swing to consult in Washington with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   ``The question of a unified Germany is not one that will be
solved by the United states alone,'' Bush told a fund-raising
breakfast for Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   ``In the final analysis, it's a question for the people of
Germany to decide. But the United States remains committed to German
membership in NATO,'' Bush said.
   The Soviet Union is opposed to having a unified Germany in NATO.
   Bush also renewed his call for the Soviets to establish peaceful
dialog with Lithuanian leaders to resolve the tumult in that Baltic
republic.
   Bush touted the five-yearcognized people whose homes he had stayed
in during early
campaign trips.
   On Friday the president returned as a major drawing card for GOP
candidates. Mary Matalin, Republican National Committee chief of
staff, said Bush's current political speaking trip is raising
millions for GOP candidates.
   His visits are following a usual formula: He speaks at a
breakfast, lunch or dinner that usually costs up to $1,000 per
ticket. Then, for amounts ranging from $2,000 to $5,000 apiece,
depending on the locale and the race, supporters can meet the
president at a private reception and have a picture taken.
   Matalin said Bush will take time out from campaigning in July
because of the NATO summit in London and the economic summit in
Houston, and will vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, for much of
August. But he will be campaigning nearly nonstop in September and
October.
   Bush, himself a former RNC chairman, has even suggested trips
himself that party officials haven't recommended, Matalin said.
   For instance, she told reporters, Bush wanted to do a fundraising
stop on Thursday in Milwaukee for Gov. Tommy Thompson even though
Thompson is far ahead in the polls and RNC officials felt he didn't
need the help.
   On most political stops, Bush also appears at a ``presidential''
event _ so that part of the cost of the visit can be defrayed by tax
dollars.
   Thus, in addition to his stop here to speak for Branstad, Bush
spoke with Iowa pork producers on ongoing trade talks in Geneva. He
was combining a stop in Omaha, Neb., later Friday for GOP Senate
candidate Hal Daub, with a discussion with a community anti-drug
group.
   Bush spoke on Thursday at fundraisers for Thompson's re-election
effort in Milwaukee and for Illinois GOP gubernatorial candidate Jim
Edgar in Chicago.

   Eleven coal miners trapped by flooding in a western

   The newspaper said six bodies had been recovered so far and
rescue workers were searching for the remains of the other miners.
   ``A government commission is investigating the causes of the
accident, but it is already clear that safety violations were
responsible,'' Trud said.
   The accident occurred Sunday in the Dimitrov mine near
Novokuznetsk in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin, 2,100 miles east of Moscow.
   Scuba divers on Monday attempted to reach the trapped miners but
were unable to reach the disaster site, a mine official said.

<TEXT>
   A city alderman is creating a stir with
his proposal that the city council stop reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance regularly.
   ``Routine recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a situation
having no direct relationship to the entity to which the allegiance
is being pledged tends to trivialize the flag,'' Alderman Les
Nelson's resolution says.
   Nelson said council meetings have only a ``mimimal'' relationship
to the federal government. He added that the pledge would be more
meaningful if it was recited only on special occasions, such as
Veterans Day or Flag Day.
   The council is scheduled to consider the resolution Tuesday
night. Alan Colvin, another member of the council, called it a ``a
wacky idea.''
   ``The Pledge of Allegiance to the flag is symbolic to patriotism.
I think it's important for us to do these kind of things, especially
as elected officials. Patriotism and Americanism are hot issues
these days. This will attract a lot of attention,'' he said.

   She studies for a job that may not exist,
lives on an allowance that seems to buy less, and comes from a city
where the main industry is expected to die.
   Beatrice Uhlig sat in front of East Germany's Parliament at
midnight Thursday, one of a few hundred college students sprawled on
the steps of the big building, their banners crumpled beside them.
   Earlier in the day, thousands staged a sit-in at the Parliament's
main entrance to demand increases in their living allowances, which
they say are not keeping pace with rising prices.
   At 8 a.m., Beatrice Uhlig was calling for a higher stipend to
stay in college. At midnight, as the students' protest wore on, she
was contemplating life after school.
   ``Do I have hope? Not much,'' said the 23-year-old dairy science
student at East Berlin's Humboldt University. ``But I am young.
There is always a future.''
   East Germany is to officially become a free market July 2, when
it merges its economy with West Germany's in a major step to German
unification.
   The day that Germans call ``Day X'' is still five weeks away, but
the effects have already begun.
   Joblessness has started to rise. Farmers are sitting on stocks of
unsold meat and vegetables, which are being shunned by East German
consumers who prefer better-quality Western goods.
   Several industries are facing canceled orders from distributors,
who are keeping their warehouses open for the influx of Western-made
products they would rather sell.
   East German lawmakers held a heated debate Thursday over whether
to force retailers and distributors to sell goods grown or made by
East German industries.
   They finally decided not to tamper with the embryonic free
market, voting instead to allow farms and industries to bypass
wholesalers completely and try to sell their goods directly to
retail stores.
   This was a mere stopgap measure to Miss Uhlig, who has little
hope for the future of her field.
   She is an agriculture student specializing in dairy production, a
highly specialized area that is geared to work on a Communist farm
collective.
   The huge collectives are run as overstaffed factories, with
workers trained for specific jobs. The system is inefficient
compared to market-oriented Western farms, where cows are milked by
regular workers, not college-trained dairy engineers.
   ``I am not sure if there is much hope for my type of job,'' she
said.
   Miss Uhlig's hometown is the southern industrial town of Zwickau,
which produces the East German Trabant auto, a tiny, low-tech,
two-cylinder car that is disappearing fast from East German streets.
   ``My sister's husband works there, but I don't know for how
long,'' she said.
   Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl told Parliament on Thursday that
the government will discuss the possibility of closing large
sections of industries to conduct massive retraining programs.
   He said this discussion would take place against the backdrop of
the ``hopeless situation'' in many industries, including the auto
industry.
   The stipend Miss Uhlig receives while attending school is 200
marks a month, right now the equivalent of 100 West German marks, or
$60.
   The students who protested Thursday demanded 500 marks.
   ``We need it,'' she said. ``Prices are high. Prices are high
because East Germans are buying West German products.''
   Miss Uhlig said she feels pessimistic because so much of East
Germany's transition to a new society is a mystery.
   Both German governments believe an initial stage of economic
hardship will dissipate as Western investment moves in, creating new
jobs and raising living standards.
   ``I hope it happens,'' said Miss Uhlig.

   A couple of car-crossed lovers is suing an
insurer for damages, claiming an unplanned pregnancy resulted from
an automobile accident in Naples' ``love park.''
   Italian newspapers reported Friday that the claim involves an
accident in March involving a medium-sized Regata and a tiny Panda
car. The accident occurred in a park that nightly attracts scores of
couples who make love in their cars.
   The young man claimed he and his girlfriend were engaged in
amorous activity in their small car when the large car hit it from
behind. The impact momentarily made them lose control, resulting in
the pregnancy, La Stampa and La Repubblica newspapers reported.
   The case came to light when an agent of the insurance company
decided to publicize the claim to illustrate the absurdity of some
bids to win compensation, La Stampa reported.
   The suit demands compensation for the cost of repairing the Panda
and the cost of the wedding the couple decided to have after
discovering the woman was pregnant.

<HEAD>NATO Welcomes Warsaw Pact Plans To Transform Itself</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Gorbachev comments on need for
greater cooperation between military alliances. EDITS to trim. No
pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TURNBERRY, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO foreign ministers today welcomed
plans by the rival Warsaw Pact to study ways of transforming itself
from a military alliance into a political organization.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in Moscow that NATO and the
Warsaw Pact should be cooperating in the same way as European
leaders from both blocs and that he might support one security
system for all of Europe.
   The ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said they
were ``encouraged by the positive spirit'' shown by a summit of
Warsaw Pact leaders in Moscow on Thursday.
   In a final statement concluding their own two-day meeting, the
NATO ministers said they were ``ready to contribute actively to
building confidence and closer relations between all European
countries, including the members of the two alliances.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner went out of his way to
extend ``the hand of friendship and cooperation'' to the Soviet
Union and others in the Warsaw Pact.
   He said NATO wanted to end Soviet isolation from the rest of
Europe.
   ``The Soviet Union would gain stability,'' he said. ``It would
gain partners, even friends _ what a gain for the Soviet Union, what
a gain for the whole of Europe.''
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the Western
allies were themselves forming ``a new alliance, renewed and
reinvigorated to develop and ensure a Europe whole and freed.''
   NATO officials have been taking a hard look at their own alliance
and its strategy in an era of reduced East-West tensions.
   On Thursday, leaders of the seven Warsaw Pact nations ended their
summit by declaring that their military alliance, long dominated by
the Soviet Union, must be ``transformed'' to reflect the changes in
Europe. The summit said it would study ways to bring that
transformation about.
   A senior U.S. official said today he saw the Warsaw Pact summit
as a triumph for Gorbachev in that he managed to keep Hungary and
Czechoslovakia in the alliance for now.
   ``The fact that the Warsaw Pact was able to do this may make the
Soviet Union a little calmer'' about the impending unification of
Germany, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Warsaw Pact has nearly collapsed since the Soviet Union's
allies began ousting their long-ruling Communist regimes last year.
   Gorbachev said today it was time for greater closeness between
the alliances because of the changing politics in Europe.
   ``If the leaders of the governments cooperate on the political
level, these organizations can't stand aside from their
governments,'' he said at a joint news conference with visiting
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she did not think the time was right for a
system of all-European security, which would end the division of
Europe into competing military alliances.
   But Gorbachev said he disagreed.
   ``One can have the policy that will resemble an elephant in a
china store: One move to the left smashes half of the store. A move
to the right smashes the other half,'' he said. ``If this is the
policy we choose, I don't envy us.''
   If NATO shows the same willingness as the Warsaw Pact to
transform itself ``this will open the possibilities for ... some
agreement in favor of an all-European system of security,''
Gorbachev said.
   The NATO communique also stressed that the ministers ``attach the
highest priority to the conclusion this year'' of a treaty to cut
U.S. and Soviet troops and non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   The allies said they were prepared to make ``reasonable
compromises'' to finish the treaty. They said they told their
negotiators in Vienna to pursue new approaches, particularly on
aircraft, armor and verification measures.
   The Soviets have been objecting to the inclusion of hundreds of
planes that the Western allies categorize as combat weapons. Moscow
argues that their mission is purely defensive.
   The ministers reiterated their demand that a united Germany be a
member of NATO. ``We believe that European stability, as well as the
wishes of the German people, requires that a unified Germany be a
full member of this alliance,'' they said.
   They also said the West sought ``no unilateral advantage from
German unity'' and was prepared ``to demonstrate this, taking into
account legitimate Soviet security interests.''
   President Bush said today he did not believe the future of a
unified Germany would be ``solved quickly or easily.''
   ``In the final analysis, it's a question for the people of
Germany to decide,'' Bush said at a Republican fund-raising
breakfast in Des Moines, Iowa. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher felt more
confident after meeting today with Gorbachev that the standoff would
be resolved, a spokesman said.
   Gorbachev has opposed NATO membership for a united Germany. The
Soviets have suggested that the new German state either be neutral
or belong to the Warsaw Pact.
   The NATO ministers also endorsed a nine-point list of assurances
drawn up by the United States to gain Moscow's support of NATO
membership for the new Germany.
   The list includes promises to allow Soviet troops to remain
temporarily in what is now East Germany and to keep Western forces
off that territory.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jose Figueres, who
led Costa Rica through a revolution and into 41 years of continuous
peace, died today, officials said. He was 83.
   Figueres died at home in San Jose, presidential spokesman Ana
Lorena Vargas said. The cause of his of death was not known.
   The U.S.-educated Figueres was elected president three times. He
abolished the army in 1949. A civil guard remains the nation's sole
line of defense in this island of tranquility surrounded by
neighbors in turmoil.
   Affectionately known as ``Don Pepe,'' Figueres was a
contradictory figure. He boasted of having worked closely with the
CIA in his earlier days. But he raged against U.S. policy against
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, which ruled until it was
ousted earlier this year in free elections.
   Born in 1906 of Catalonian immigrants in Costa Rica, Figueres
entered politics and by the 1940s had developed a strong following.
   In 1948, after allegedly fraudulent elections, Figueres took to
the hills with a band of rebels and led a brief but bloody
revolution that overthrew President Fernando Calderon Guardia, who
had allied himself with the Communist Party.
   After taking over as president of a provisional junta for a year,
Figueres banned the Communists, oversaw the writing of a new
constitution that provided increased social services and, most
importantly, banned the army, the only Latin American leader in
history to do so.
   ``This small country made a contribution to mankind by outlawing
the army,'' he said. ``But we had to pay dearly. We killed 2,000
Communists.''
   Figueres had a second term from 1953 to 1958 and a third from
1970 to 1974. He was an accessible president, often seen on the
streets of San Jose.
   His short, graying figure remained for years a familiar sight at
gatherings of almost any class in Costa Rica, always traveling alone
without bodyguards.
   He lived his last years in a simple A-frame house on a farm in
the hills 10 miles east of San Jose.
   While anti-communism had been a trademark of his earlier years,
Figueres grew to tolerate and even embrace the left. He was an
adviser to the Sandinistas before and after they ousted dictator
Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   He saw U.S. backing for anti-Sandinista rebels as flawed.
   However, he said U.S. policy was succeeding in El Salvador, where
he visited as an observer during elections in 1984.
   Figueres studied electrical engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. from 1934 to 1938, but
never pursued engineering. He married Henrietta Boggs of Alabama in
1942, and they had two children before the marriage ended in 1952.
   He then married Karen Olsen, a naturalized American citizen of
Danish birth. They had three children and were divorced in 1980.

<HEAD>Allies Hope For Arms Cuts Accord With Warsaw Pact This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TURNBERRY, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO officials ended a two-day meeting
Friday saying they want an East-West accord this year on arms and
troop cuts in Europe and are willing to compromise further to get
one.
   The negotiations in Vienna have slowed down over proposed cuts in
warplanes and over Soviet reservations about a unified Germany
belonging to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III and allied foreign
ministers who met in this Scottish seacoast town concluded the
Soviets were lowering their objections.
   The Soviets have opposed NATO's efforts in the Vienna
negotiations to restrict aircraft that Moscow considers defensive.
   As a result, the Warsaw Pact has not responded to the latest NATO
proposal, which sets a ceiling of 195,000 on U.S. and Soviet troops
in Central Europe and imposes limits on tanks, aircraft, artillery,
armored personnel carriers, helicopters and other non-nuclear arms.
   ``We strongly emphasize that we attach the highest priority to
the conclusion this year of a CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe)
treaty,'' the NATO communique said.
   The allies pledged ``to explore all open issues on the basis of a
willingness on all sides to make reasonable compromises.
   ``We have, therefore, instructed our negotiators in Vienna to
pursue new approaches to mutually acceptable solutions, in
particular, on aircraft, armor and verification,'' the NATO
ministers said.
   Baker, at a news conference, said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze indicated to him Tuesday in Copenhagen, Denmark,
that ``they would have new proposals.''
   Other U.S. officials said they might be put on the table in
Vienna in the next few days.
   Baker has offered Shevardnadze a nine-point Western package of
guarantees, including that NATO troops would not move into what is
now East Germany after the German states are united.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher insisted the
final communique reiterate past West German statements pledging the
territory would be off-limits to NATO troops.
   That apparent rift aside, Baker, NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner and foreign ministers of the Western alliance emphasized
they wanted to allay Soviet concerns about having a more powerful
neighbor.
   ``We extend to the Soviet Union and all other European countries
the hand of friendship and cooperation,'' Woerner said.
   The NATO statement also welcomed plans by the longtime rival
Warsaw Pact to undertake a drastic political overhaul.
   The allies said they were ``encouraged by the positive spirit''
shown by at the summit meeting held by the Soviet Union with leaders
of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and
Romania in Moscow on Thursday and especially pleased ``by the
readiness on the part of the countries ... for constructive
cooperation.''
   Woerner said ``we want to build bridges'' to the Warsaw Pact and
end what he described as Soviet isolation from the rest of Europe.
   At the same time, Woerner did not try to woo the members into the
Western alliance. ``It is not our task to invite such moves nor it
is our intention to do so,'' he said.

   Senate Republicans are stalling Democratic
efforts to slap President Bush with his first veto override after
the House voted to set aside presidential rejection of an Amtrak
funding bill.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the vote was too
important to the president for a vote Thursday or today with several
Republicans absent. None of Bush's 10 vetoes last year was
overturned, and the Amtrak bill prompted his first veto of 1990.
   Bush told reporters today, ``I think it's going to be very
close'' in the Senate. He said he hoped Congress would sustain his
veto.
   Bush has said he supports the bill's authorization of $2 billion
for Amtrak over the next three years but vetoed the measure because
of a provision that increases government control over freight
railroad buy outs.
   Democrats accused the administration of trying to scuttle support
for the successful national passenger rail service _ a course
followed unsuccessfully by the Reagan administration.
   ``The administration has again showed its opposition to the
funding for Amtrak,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.
   As Republican senators tried to round up votes to protect
presidential prestige, House GOP leaders introduced an alternative
measure that supports Amtrak but leaves out increased Interstate
Commerce Commission authority over rail takeover attempts.
   The ICC already has the power to scrutinize takeovers involving
multiple railroads or a portion of a railroad. The bill would give
it authority over the buy out of a whole railroad by non-rail
interests.
   Bush, in his veto message, called the provision ``a step backward
for the entire rail industry.'' He said it would interfere with the
ability of railroads to obtain financing and be a step towards
re-regulation of the industry.
   Democrats argued that government scrutiny is needed to prevent
corporate raiders from ruining the nation's railroads with leverage
buy outs.
   ``The president is committed to an adequate passenger rail
service,'' said House GOP leader Bob Michel of Illinois. He said
Bush would not veto the measure if it is passed again without the
ICC provision.
   The vetoed bill also contained provisions needed to start a
commuter rail service into Virginia suburbs near Washington, to save
Amtrak $16 million over two years in unemployment insurance for rail
workers and to allow truck, bus and rail workers to file state
income tax in only one state even though they may work in several.
   Exon opened debate on the override in the Senate and tried to
push for a quick vote, but Republicans first failed to field any
response, and then Dole announced he'd prevent a vote.
   ``The trains are going to run whether we do this today, next
Wednesday or a week from Wednesday,'' Dole said.
   The veto has not affected Amtrak operations because the railroad
is working with money that Congress already has appropriated. The
bill envisions more than $2 billion going to the line through Sept.
30, 1992. Actual amounts will be determined when Congress
appropriates the money.
   Democrats are expected to push for a vote on the override again
next week.
   The Amtrak authorization passed the House 322-93 and got
unanimous support in the Senate, but the ICC provision was added
during negotiations between the two houses that produced the final
bill.
   Several Republicans indicated opposition to the Amtrak aid as
well as the leverage buy-out provision.

   Although he has been music director of the
New York Philharmonic since 1978, Zubin Mehta has not conducted an
entire opera in New York in 19 years.
   But that hasn't stopped him from conducting opera elsewhere, and
on Thursday he led Luciano Pavarotti in the opening night of a new
production of Verdi's ``Il Trovatore'' at the Maggio Musicale
Fiorentina, Florence's spring music festival.
   Mehta, the longest-tenured music director in New York
Philharmonic history, often has been accused of uninspired
performances in New York. Part of the problem is the
four-concert-a-week routine and the notoriously bad acoustics in
Avery Fisher Hall.
   On Thursday night at the Teatro Comunale, his conducting was
propulsive and exciting. At times he revved up the orchestra in a
manner similar to that of Sir Georg Solti, the Chicago Symphony
music director who long has been the champion of boisterous
conducting.
   Mehta actually began his opera career in this art-filled city on
the Arno River, debuting with Verdi's ``La Traviata'' in 1964. He
has not conducted opera anywhere in the United States since leading
Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' at Los Angeles 2{ years ago. His
last New York opera performance was a ``Trovatore'' at the
Metropolitan Opera on March 20, 1971.
   Since Mehta also is muic director of the Maggio Musicale, he was
able to put together a steller cast for Thursday's performance.
Pavarotti also sang Manrico in the 4,000-seat Metropolitan Opera
House two years ago; in an auditorium half that size he was much
more convincing, his tenor filling the hall without strain.
   Dolora Zajick, a Slavic soprano, sang Azucena, a role she also
performed with Pavarotti at the Met.
   While Dame Joan Sutherland and Eva Marton sang Leonora at the
Met, the young soprano Antonella Banaudi sang it on Thursday night,
a replacement for Susan Dunn. Giorgio Zancanero was the Count di
Luna, Manrico's rival for Leonora's affections.
   The production, the first new ``Trovatore'' in Florence since
1977, was done by Giuliano Montaldo, a film director. Nana Cecchi
designed outstanding period costumes and the sets by Luciano Ricceri
were handsome and unusually realistic _ the opposite of the ugly
black marble steps that dominate Fabrizio Melano's Met production.
   In sharp contrast to the way things are in New York, Mehta was
the star of the show, getting the loudest ovation of the night from
the glamorous Florentine audience.

   The chairman of the National Endowment for the
Arts acknowledged Friday that he receives free singing lessons from
an employee. A spokesman said he intends to continue doing so.
   ``There would be no reason not to,'' said Jack Lichtenstein, the
endowment's public affairs director.
   NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer, an amateur lyric baritone, said
Alvin Knutsen, a special assistant with the agency, has provided
between 12 and 15 lessons since Frohnmayer came to Washington in
October. Frohnmayer said he does not pay for the sessions.
   Frohnmayer said neither Knutsen nor Ann Colgrove, NEA's director
of policy, who provides piano accompaniment for the sessions, was
coerced.
   ``We all have done it as friends,'' he said. Asked if he saw any
impropriety in it, he replied, ``None whatsoever.''
   The chairman said Knutsen, a former professional bass-baritone,
volunteered to provide the lessons, which are given ``at the end of
the day or around the lunch hour.''
   He said the sessions are normally in preparation for some event
such as an in-house program at the endowment or his recent
appearance as a guest soloist with the Capitol Hill Choral Society.
   Frohnmayer is an attorney from Portland, Ore. His official NEA
biography says he has appeared in recital, oratorio, musical comedy
and other musical productions in New York, Chicago, Palo Alto,
Calif., and Oregon.
   Knutsen declined to comment on the instruction he provides his
boss.
   ``All the inquiries are being handled by the press office
upstairs,'' he said. ``I am sorry I can't help you.''
   The first account of the lessons appeared in The Washington Times
on Thursday.
   Knutsen, who has a doctorate in vocal music and opera, has been
with NEA for about two years.

   The inventor of a device a 54-year-old woman used
this week to commit asked a circuit judge today allow him to form a
committee to establish an international ``planned death policy.''
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian told Judge Alice Gilbert he wanted to form a
committee with members from all sectors of society that would study
his device, which involves injection of coma- and death-inducing
drugs, and the circumstances under which it could be used.
   The panel would establish a policy ``for the world'' for use of
his invention, Kevorkian said, promising he would refrain from using
it again until the committee completed its work.
   Gilbert recessed the hearing in Pontiac until this afternoon
without ruling.
   Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson took Kevorkian to
court, seeking an injunction barring further use of the device that
killed Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore.
   Although Michigan has no law against assisting suicide, Thompson
has said authorities are investigating the possibility of charges
against the doctor, and they don't want the device used again.
   Adkins killed herself Monday after Kevorkian hooked her to the
machine and she pressed a button to release the lethal chemicals.
   Fewer than half of the states have outlawed helping someone
commit suicide, but law professors say the legality of such
assistance is open to interpretation.
   Meanwhile, a survey in USA Today found that two-thirds of people
say the terminally ill should be allowed to end their lives, and
medical facilities should be available to help them do it.
   The phone poll of 724 adults, with a sampling error of 3.5
percent, also found 28 percent feel Kevorkian should be prosecuted
and 43 percent said he shouldn't be punished.
   Although authorities failed to subpoena Kevorkian at his Royal
Oak home Thursday, they did serve papers to his sisters, Margo Janus
of Troy and Flora Holzheimer of Frankfurt, West Germany. They
allegedly were present in the Oakland County park where Adkins died
in the back of Kevorkian's 1968 Volkswagen van.
   Assisting a suicide is a crime in 23 states and three U.S.
territories, said Robert Brown, professor and director of the Health
Law Center at the University of Detroit Law School.
   In those jurisdictions, assisting suicide is classified as a
unique offense, manslaughter or murder, Brown said.
   States and territories with laws against aiding suicide include:
Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Guam, Hawaii,
Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Texas, Washington,
Wisconsin and the Virgin Islands.
   ``I think it's unlikely that Michigan is going to become the
suicide haven of North America,'' Brown said. ``There may be an
aiding and abetting statute in which a prosecutor may squeeze these
facts in.''
   Suicide is legal in Michigan, but Professor Yale Kamisar of the
University of Michigan Law School said the legality of assisting a
suicide is open to debate.
   In 1920, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that a man who had put
poison within the reach of his deathly ill wife was guilty of
first-degree murder when she committed suicide, Kamisar said.
   But in 1983, the state Court of Appeals said a man shouldn't be
charged with murder because he had given a friend a gun that the
friend later used to commit suicide.
   ``The high court didn't review the 1983 appeal, so we have this
intermediate court causing all this confusion,'' Kamisar said.

   When the going gets
tough, even the toughest pardners on the Wyoming Centennial Wagon
Train can get going _ straight to the whining tent.
   All in all, folks have been pretty happy on the month-long,
260-mile trek, wagon train spokesman B.J. Wertz said. But this being
the enlightened '90s _ 1990s, that is _ certain precautions must be
taken.
   ``If someone starts complaining, we send them to the whining
tent,'' Wertz said. ``That pretty much lightens people up.''
   So far, the only things people have had to whine about have been
some fairly stiff winds on Thursday, some bad hay and a couple of
minor accidents.
   More than 70 wagons and nearly 1,000 people from across the
United States are participating in the trip from Casper to Cody,
which is being made to celebrate Wyoming's centennial. On Thursday,
they campd at Arminto, about 50 miles west of Casper.
   In one of the most frightening mishaps so far, a 13-year-old girl
was thrown from her horse Thursday and flown by helicopter to the
Wyoming Medical Center, where she was treated and released. The
girl, whose identity was not made public, will be rejoining the
wagon train, Wertz said.
   Other minor incidents, like a sheep wagon coming loose from its
hitch and sliding into a barrow pit, or broken wagon wheels and
hitch tongues, have pulled the train together, Wertz said.
   ``It's just like if you're driving along the highway and you
break down, only someone will stop and help you,'' she said.
   Pulling together on the trail has also made for fun evenings in
camp.
   ``Every night there's been guitar playing and storytelling,'' she
said. There's a squeeze box (accordion) in camp and there's lots of
music and dancing. It's real spontaneous fun. There's even cowboy
poetry.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he is
considering breaking off talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization in the wake of a terrorist attack on an Israeli beach
but ``no decision has been made.''
   Bush, speaking with reporters on a Midwestern political trip, was
asked about a report in The Washington Times that the administration
has decided to break off its 16-month dialogue with the PLO.
   ``I'm not prepared to make an announcement on policy at this
point,'' Bush said. However, he said, ``our dialogue is predicated
on a renunciation of terror. In my view, this is sheer terror.''
   Speaking separately at a NATO conference, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said the administration is seeking more
information on the raid.
   He said a decision on the U.S.-PLO talks would be made ``when we
are satisfied we know all we need to know.''
   Bush said he'd like to see PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ``speak out
... I've expressed my outrage about the attack,'' Bush said. ``Maybe
I can take this opportunity to express my outrage about all the
violence in the Middle East.''
   Asked if he was planned to cut off the U.S.-PLO dialogue, Bush
said, ``We are discussing all of that. No decision has been made.''
   Arafat has denied any PLO involvement in last month's raid but
has not condemned the act outright.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction, claimed
responsibility for the raid, in which six speedboats attempted to
attack a crowded beach but were intercepted by Israeli security
forces. The PLF is headed by Mohammed Abbas, who uses the name Abul
Abbas and who masterminded the Achille Lauro cruise ship hijacking.
   In Washington, White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk
said the administration has received some information about the
attack from the Israelis.
   Separately, an administration official said a decision was not
expected for a number of days. The official, who declined to be
identified, said the United States has held at least four meetings
with PLO representatives since the raid to discuss the
organization's views on it.
   On the subject of the possible formation of a new right-wing
government in Israel, Bush said that was ``an internal matter for
Israel.''
   ``Israel can do what it wants with this government and I'll work
with whoever that country puts forward as their government,'' Bush
said. ``But they know the policy of the United States on peace
talks. U.S. policy is firm. We want the peace talks to begin.''
   Diplomatic sources in Washington said earlier in the day that the
United States had decided to suspend the talks and would make the
announcement next week. The sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the administration would cite the attack and the
PLO's decision not to condemn the action.
   Baker, in Turnberry, Scotland, for a NATO foreign ministers
meeting, said terrorism is not the sole issue in deciding whether
the United States will suspend its 16-month dialogue with the PLO.
   ``It is important that we pursue peace in the Middle East in a
serious manner,'' Baker told a news conference. Asked if he meant to
suggest the impact a cutoff might have on Middle East peace talks
would outweigh the U.S. anti-terrorism policy, Baker said:
   ``I don't want to seem to be suggesting in any way that we would
countenance terrorism in order to advance the noble cause of peace.''
   Baker told reporters the talks were continuing while the
administration sought to find out ``all we need to know'' about the
circumstances. He declined to say what information was still
lacking.''
   The dialogue with the PLO, carried out by Robert Pelletreau, the
U.S. ambassador in Tunisia, where the organization has its
headquarters, was begun after PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist in December 1988.
   The U.S. government said it would end all contact at any time if
the PLO failed to live up to its renunciation of terrorism.
   The May 30 assault by Palestine Liberation Front guerrillas was
thwarted by Israeli forces. PLF leaders said the attack was aimed at
a military target, but Israeli officials say they have proof the aim
was to murder civilians.
   Arafat said the PLO had nothing to do with the operation, but he
has been unwilling to condemn it, and said he had no authority to
throw the PLF's representative of the PLO Executive Committee.

   A Republican official says Democrats may have
deliberately sabotaged their own state convention with a police
demonstration and then falsely blamed the GOP.
   Democrats have accused the Springfield police union and White
House aide Ronald Kaufman with trying to embarrass the party and
disrupt the convention with a police picket line outside the hall
last Saturday.
   The protest disrupted the Democratic convention at the
Springfield Civic Center, nearly forcing its cancellation.
   ``It will be very interesting when all is said and done who
really caused the problems in Springfield,'' state GOP Executive
Director Alexander Tennant said Thursday.
   Tennant offered no proof for his accusations, and Democrats have
offered little proof for their accusations against Kaufman, saying
he met briefly with the police union president the night before the
picketing.
   Robert Jacobson, president of the Springfield police union, which
backed George Bush over Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988
presidential campaign, denied Democrats or Republicans had anything
to do with the picketing.
   He said the union picketed to call attention to its problems with
Springfield Mayor Mary Hurley over getting a contract.
   Republicans suggested Thursday that Democratic gubernatorial
candidate John Silber and Senate President William Bulger, also a
Democrat, may have been behind the police demonstration.
   The state Democratic Party has sued the police union and has
vowed to sue Kaufman over the demonstration. Tennant said
Republicans intend to seek depositions from Silber, Bulger and
others.
   ``It will become clearer and clearer that the Republican Party
had nothing to do with this, and that there was a conspiracy,''
Tennant said.
   Robert Donahue, Silber's campaign manager, called the Republican
suggestion ``ludicrous ... beyond belief.''
   Bulger spokesman, Paul Mahoney, said, ``We had absolutely nothing
to do with any strike or disruption.''

   Nearly nine months after Hurricane Hugo
pounded South Carolina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency on
Friday shuttered its last disaster field office.
   The North Charleston office was opened two days after Hugo
smashed ashore Sept. 21, causing an estimated $5.9 billion damage
and claiming 29 lives in the most destructive hurricane to ever hit
the United States mainland.
   The North Charleston field office served as the nerve center for
FEMA recovery operations in the hurricane-ravaged area. The work
involved 1,300 state and federal employees, more than 3,400 military
and Army Corps of Engineers workers, plus nearly 500 workers hired
locally.
   That office remained open longer than any other field office to
respond to disasters in FEMA's Southeast region which includes the
Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and
Kentucky, FEMA spokesman Frank Mosco said.
   More than 89,000 people applied for aid to cover uninsured storm
losses. In all, FEMA and the Small Business Administration have
spent $675 million helping South Carolina recover from the storm.

   A man who died while going to a hearing
to fight his job dismissal has been reinstated to the job.
   The State Industrial Commission made its decision so the family
of the unidentified 62-year-old man can collect a $6,160 pension
payout.
   The commission ruled Thursday that Norman Ross Discounts fired
the 10-year employee unfairly for failing to check a truckload of
stock, some of which later turned out to be missing.
   But Norman Ross was short-staffed at the time, and the commission
ruled that the worker could not reasonably have been expected to
check the load.
   Joe de Bruyn, secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied
Employees Union, which pursued the case, said the man suffered a
heart attack while on his way to a hearing to fight for his job.
   The company is appealing the decision.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Spends Part of 65th Birthday Promoting Reading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush devoted part of her 65th birthday
Friday to a favorite task, reading to children, and recalled that
she and President Bush did that often when their kids were young.
   ``It was a chance for us to put an arm around a child and have a
special time,'' said the first lady. ``It does a lot for bonding
with your children and it pays off later.''
   Mrs. Bush appeared on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' and read
to a dozen children seated around her. The story was ``Leo, the Late
Bloomer,'' about a lion who was slow to learn to read and write.
   The children responded with a chorus of ``Happy Birthday, Mrs.
Bush.''
   ``Oh, how'd you know?'' she asked. ``Who told you that secret?
Thank you very, very much.''
   A day earlier she had said she could not care less about her
birthday. She was born June 8, 1925 in New York City.
   Bush telephoned wishes from Iowa, where he was finishing a
four-state political trip. He told reporters that ``she seemed
unexcited about her 65th birthday.''
   The National Pork Producers' Council gave the president a box of
pork chops and several bags of pork rinds, a favorite snack, and he
quipped: ``Maybe that's what I'll give to Barbara for her birthday
present.''
   The first lady, who made literacy a personal crusade, said on the
television program that ``about the most important thing that
parents can do for their children is to get them excited about and
start them reading.''
   That, she said, is because parents are the first teachers.
   ``My first memories of my mother and father are my mother curled
up on a couch reading and my dad reading,'' she said. It's a proven
fact now that children who are read to do better in school.''
   Mrs. Bush recommended letting children pick the books they are
interested in, then reading to them.
   ``We're not talking about hours,'' she said. ``We're talking a
little bit about a way of life. Have books out. Have books
available. You don't have to buy them ... have them there so the
child can pick up a book, not just story books but books about
science or whatever you think your child might be interested in.
   ``It is quality time; maybe it's 15 minutes a night, maybe it's
allowing your child to pick a book they want to read themselves to
sleep to. It's just a way of life and it's a very easy to
establish.''
   Mrs. Bush spoke also about the time she spent last week with
Soviet first lady Raisa Gorbachev, who was in this country with
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``She told me that she herself, as a working woman, had turned
down promotions so she could be home with her family,'' Mrs. Bush
said.

<TEXT>
   To some Philadelphians, it was an electrical
jolt as shocking as Ben Franklin's kite-flying experiment.
   The PSFS sign was turned off.
   The 27-foot-high red neon letters, which have glowed atop the
39-story PSFS Building for 58 years, were turned off May 21 because
the bank inside the building no longer owns the rights to the
letters.
   The reasons are complicated, but to some architectural
historians, the result is simply a mistake.
   ``Because of mergers and acquisitions in corporate America, the
sign's turned off,'' William Blades, executive director of the
Philadelphia Historic Preservation Corp., said Thursday. ``It's
silly.''
   The untrained eye may consider the 491-foot building at 12th and
Market streets just another modern skyscraper, not too big, not too
dazzling.
   Building buffs, however, positively gush when they talk about it.
In 1932, architects George Howe and William Lescaze, they say,
designed the first truly modern American skyscraper, lovingly
detailed and way ahead of its time.
   And the sign, says Susan Shearer, past president of the Society
for Commercial Archaeology, is ``an integral part of the building,
and an important element in the landscape of Philadelphia.''
   ``To turn off the sign,'' she said, ``is to eliminate a major
part of the archictectural statement.''
   Until the mid-1980s, Philadelphia custom dictated that no
building be higher than the statue of William Penn that crowns City
Hall. And the PSFS building, then the city's second tallest
structure, was a dominant feature of the skyline.
   ``If this was a billboard that's been up there two years, that's
another issue,'' Blades said. ``But this is a National Historic
Landmark.''
   Sign supporters point out that it is the country's first
large-scale illuminated graphic on the country's first modernist
skyscraper, housing the country's first savings bank.
   The bank in question was the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society,
founded in 1816 as the nation's first savings bank for regular folk,
not just businesses.
   It became known as simply PSFS. This year, PSFS's parent, Meritor
Savings Bank, sold 54 PSFS branches and the PSFS name to Mellon Bank
Corp.
   Meritor is staying in the building and keeping 29 branches, using
the new name Philadelphia Savings Fund Society.
   But since it no longer has the legal rights to the name PSFS,
Meritor decided to turn off the sign. The sign itself must stay,
protected by the landmark designation.
   ``Legally, we have no right to the PSFS name, and that's why the
sign is off,'' said Leslie Voth, vice president of corporate
communications for Meritor. ``Mellon bought the rights to the PSFS
name. If they wanted it illuminated, they would have to pay for it.''
   Mellon spokeswoman Becky Brinks offered nostalgic Philadelphians
a hint of hope. ``We're certainly willing to discuss the
possibility,'' she said.

   An astronaut who has flown on three
space shuttle missions will give up space duties to become associate
director of NASA's Ames Research Center.
   Del Harding, spokesman for the Mountain View center, announced
Thursday that Steven Hawley, 38, will start the job in late July.
   Hawley has been deputy chief of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center in
Houston since 1987.
   Harding said the full-time associate director's position hasn't
been filled on a permanent basis since 1988. The salary is still
under negotiation, but will be about $70,000 a year plus
``performance incentives,'' he added.
   Hawley has been an astronaut since 1978, making his first space
voyage in August 1984 and his last shuttle trip this in April on
Discovery.
   Born in Salina, Kan., he graduated from the University of Kansas
and received his doctorate in astronomy and astrophysics from the
University of California, Santa Cruz in 1977.

<TEXT>
   A woman telephoned police to say she had
just killed her husband and mother-in-law. Then, after asking the
police to take care of her dog, she shot and killed herself,
authorities said.
   The three dead were identified as Lorraine Napieralski, 42; her
husband, Anthony, 43, and his mother, Theresa, 63.
   ``I've just killed my husband,'' a detective quoted Lorraine
Napieralski as saying in her phone call to police shortly after 5
a.m. ``I've just killed my mother-in-law. I'm about to kill myself.
Please take care of my dog.''
   Police said they made it to the Napieralski home in this Buffalo
suburb in one minute, but not in time to prevent Mrs. Napieralski
from killing herself.
   Detective Lt. Thomas Rowan said police are aware of a motive in
the killings ``but we're not going to talk about it at this point.
It's a tragic family matter, and not much else is going to be served
at this point by talking about it.''
   The first officers to arrive found Mrs. Napieralski on a living
room couch and the two others in their bedrooms. All three were
pronounced dead at the scene of gunshot wounds.
   ``We believe the husband was shot first,'' said Rowan. ``We
believe the mother _ mother-in-law was shot next. The woman then
called the police and took her own life.''
   Investigators found the dog, Taffy, unharmed. Later in the
morning, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals picked
up the animal.
   Napieralski was a former worker for the Internal Revenue Service,
Rowan said.

<TEXT>
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste defended his
wife's ``fairly earthy'' advocacy of gay and lesbian rights and
shrugged off suggestions of political damage.
   ``What's the embarrassment?'' Celeste said when asked about
remarks by his wife, Dagmar. ``I'll bet you there are a lot of
people around here who say fairly earthy things.''
   Celeste, who heads the Democratic Governors Association, was in
Iowa for private meetings with Democratic activists and candidates
and to tape a television debate on peace issues. But he found
himself questioned Thursday about a newspaper account of a speech
his wife delivered to a group of homosexual advocates in Cincinnati.
   The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported earlier this week that Mrs.
Celeste quoted sexually explicit language from a lesbian author in
asserting her support of gay rights during the April speech. The
Plain Dealer based its account on a report in the Cincinnati-based
Gaybeat newspaper.
   Mrs. Celeste said her remarks were taken out of context. She was
attending the Cincinnati dinner to accept an award on behalf of the
governor, who was honored for opposing discrimination against
homosexuals.
   ``It was a surprise to me that a newspaper would write a story
about an event that occurred in April, based solely on a report in
an advocacy journal that they would normally never use as a basis
for a story and treat it as an objective description of the
events,'' the governor said.
   Celeste, occasionally mentioned as a Democratic presidential
candidate, made a similar tentative foray into Iowa in 1987 to talk
with party activists but decided against running for president.

   It was slimy. It was spider-infested.
And it was all in a night's work for a few police officers.
   Police followed a group of burglary suspects into a storm sewer
Thursday night and spent an hour chasing them in the cramped and
dirty drain.
   ``It was slimy and skinny down there,'' said Sgt. G. Morimoto.
   Five or six men were seen carrying items out of a house on
Albuquerque's west side, police said. Morimoto said witnesses told
police the men fled down the street.
   When police showed up, they saw the suspects duck into the sewer.
   Six officers climbed into the tunnel entrance to the sewer.
   The three who were arrested, ages 28, 22 and 16, were caught
before they could squeeze into a narrow section of the sewer,
Morimoto said.
   The others escaped through a sewer grate.
   The three were arrested on charges of breaking and entering and
conspiracy.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students and colleagues of American
educator Thomas Sutherland gathered at the American University of
Beirut on Friday to mark a grim milestone _ the passing of
Sutherland's fifth year as a hostage in Lebanon.
   Sutherland begins his sixth year in captivity Saturday. In the
time since he was captured June 9, 1985, the only word on his
welfare has come from former hostages who were held with him.
   The pro-Iranian group that holds him, Islamic Jihad, has never
issued a photograph of Sutherland as it has its other captives.
   ``The four things that mean the most to Tom ... are his home, his
family, his work and his friends, and he found all four of those
here in Beirut and at AUB,'' Sutherland's wife, Jean, told the
gathering at the lecture hall in the university's agriculture
facility.
   One of those attending was Elham Cicippio, the wife of American
hostage Joseph Cicippio, who was the acting comptroller at the
American University of Beirut. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``People who have come out from where he is and who have been
with him say that Tom speaks and thinks of AUB and wants to come
back,'' Mrs. Sutherland said.
   The Scottish-born Sutherland, 59, of Fort Collins, Colo., was
dean of agriculture and food sciences at the American University of
Beirut when he was kidnapped June 8, 1985.
   In addition to Sutherland and Cicippio, 14 other Westerners are
missing in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985. Next to Anderson, Sutherland has been held
the longest.
   Most of the hostages are held by pro-Iranian Shiite factions.
   Mrs. Sutherland still lives at the American University in Moslem
west Beirut, continuing the work she and her husband were doing when
he was abducted.
   ``Tom and I are ordinary people,'' she said Friday. ``We came
here to do a job. The job is still to be done and we're still doing
it.
   ``All that we know is that he has life and health and work to do
and we will continue with that work,'' she added.
   She said what her husband is going through is ``only a
reflection, a shadow of what the people in Lebanon'' have gone
through in 15 years of civil war.
   She and the students pinned photographs of Sutherland in happier
times to a board in the hall.
   ``What Tom would say to the faculty of agriculture and food
sciences is we have our memories on the board out there, but we
don't go to the past,'' Mrs. Sutherland said.
   ``Let's not let this time be a time of sadness, but rather a time
of gladness,'' she added.
   ``We hope that ... when he comes out it means reconciliation, it
means that people are not divided, that people are on their way to
work together in peace and harmony,'' she said.
   The Sutherlands have three daughters, Ann, 32; Kit, 30; and Joan,
26. They all live and work in the United States.
   Former hostages have told Mrs. Sutherland that her husband's
captors had given him a picture she had placed in a newspaper of his
only granddaughter, Simone, 3, who was born after his abduction.
   Sutherland was seized as he drove from the airport after arriving
from the United States to attend the graduation of his students.
Mrs. Sutherland said in an interview with The Associated Press that
her husband had been hesitant about returning to Beirut because of
the civil war and kidnappings.
   ``But somehow there weren't any further indications that things
were any worse than they had been, and he made that decision to
go,'' she said.
   She recalled that in the last week before he returned to Beirut,
an interviewer asked her husband whether he was afraid.
   ``He said, `If I'm going to be afraid I'd better not be there.'''
   She added: ``We made the choice to come. We made the choice to
stay and I know that Tom always felt that it was worth it.
   ``We always had the sense that if somebody can make it, Tom will
because he's a very strong person. But he's also a very sensitive
person and I know that for him this has been an ordeal because his
work is his life,'' Mrs. Sutherland said.
   ``So, I try to to carry on the sense of that work and I feel
everything I do is Tom and I doing it together,'' she added.

   The Empire State Building, which is illuminated
with green lights every St. Patrick's Day and red, white and blue
for the Fourth of July, will be awash in lavender this month to
honor Gay Pride Weekend.
   The building's managers agreed to the special display after six
years of lobbying by homosexual rights groups. The lavender lights
will be on June 22-24. Lavender is the traditional color of the gay
rights movement.
   ``We are in total agreement with ... leaders who seek to end the
bigotry and discrimination directed against gay and lesbian New
Yorkers,'' the manager, Helmsley-Spear Inc., said in a statement.
``We hope our participating will help end the type of ignorance that
breeds this mindless prejudice.''
   The decision was made at the request of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation. It was one of hundreds of requests for
special lightings the 102-story building receives annually.
   Helmsley-Spear's statement did not say why the decision took six
years. A spokesman, Robert Udowitz, declined to elaborate.
   On June 21, the top 30 stories of the Empire State will be
illuminated with black, gold and green lights _ the colors of the
African National Congress _ to mark the June 20-23 visit of ANC
Deputy President Nelson Mandela, Udowitz said. On Monday it was blue
for ``Unity Day,'' promoting racial harmony.
   In other annual displays, the tower is illuminated with yellow
and white lights during Easter week and red, black and green lights
for Martin Luther King Day.
   Gay Pride Weekend includes a march of as many as 150,000 people.

   Oh, Jamie Willard wished he was an Oscar
Mayer wiener. That is what he truly wanted to be. And if he drove
around in a 23-foot-long hot dog, people on the street certainly
would be agog.
   Willard is one of 13 college graduates to complete a Oscar Mayer
Food Corp. training program this week to drive the motorized
promotional hot dog around the country for the Madison-based food
provider.
   Willard says he plans to relish his new job.
   ``I loved the commercials but I never thought I'd be doing
this,'' he said. ``This is going to be the best job in the world.''
   Willard, who graduated last month from Aquinas College in Grand
Rapids, Mich., and his ``hotdogger'' colleagues will be divided into
groups of two and will cruise around the country in the 23-foot-long
hot dog vehicle.
   While cruising the United States, the vehicle will make
promotional stops.
   The hotdogger training includes classes on the history of Oscar
Mayer and how to deal with the public, although the real test is
when the driver gets behind the wheel of the giant dog for the first
time.
   After Russell Coy, a graduate of New Mexico State University in
Las Cruces, mustered up the courage to get into the cockpit-like
driver's seat, he said it felt good to be honking and waving at
surprised people on the street and in cars.
   ``I feel like I'm the top dog!'' Coy declared.
   Hot dog jokes have been passed down through the three classes of
hotdoggers, who warn newcomers against such job hazards as getting
grilled by reporters.
   Laughing and having fun are prerequisites for being a hotdogger,
said Rick Wood, who is in charge of keeping the Wienermobiles
running and teaching students to drive them.
   The paid, year-long internship program began in 1988 as a way to
beef up advertising and give graduates the chance to learn about
Oscar Mayer, he said. About 500 people applied for the program this
year.
   ``Some of our best salesman have come from the Hotdogger
program,'' he said.
   The first Wienermobile, built in Chicago in 1936, was a 13-foot
metal hot dog built to transport Little Oscar, the world's smallest
chef.
   Although their new jobs will be demanding _ they'll be on the
road 25 days a month _ the interns beamed when they talked about the
coming year and how the job will help them in the future.
   ``At first, my parents said, `Four years of college _ why
this?''' said Isabelle Ferrera, a graduate of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. ``But it's a great career move and it will be a
nice transition.''
   Wood offered the graduates a final wiener warning: ``Watch your
buns.''

   A series of explosions rocked a solvent
packaging company south of Houston late this morning, injuring at
least one person and spewing black smoke that could be seen from
downtown Houston 12 miles away.
   There was no immediate report of any deaths from the inferno at
the Solvents and Chemicals Inc. plant, located in an industrial area
south of Houston. Emergency officials said they did not know what
was burning.
   The plant, with about two dozen employees, handles kerosene and
gun cleaning agents, televised reports said.
   More than an hour after the first blast at 11 a.m., fires were
still setting off storage tanks and hurling smaller storage drums in
the air.
   A four-block area near the plant, about three-quarters of a mile
north of a residential area, was evacuated.
   One person at the locally owned plant was taken by helicopter to
Hermann Hospital in Houston, the hospital said. There was no
immediate word on the extent of the person's injuries.
   John Loessin, whose family owns Pearland Lumber Co. Inc. about
three blocks from the plant, said, ``We didn't hear any boom at all.
We keep looking out the window and we keep seeing a big puff of
black smoke go out.''
   Loessin and employees at the store said they found out about the
explosion when a spouse of an employee called to see if they were OK.
   Pearland, a community of about 15,000, is located 12 miles south
of Houston.
   Last October, a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant exploded at
Pasadena, about a dozen miles away from today's blast, killing 23
people and injuring more than 100.
   There is a heavy concentration of plastics and chemical plants
and oil refineries in the metropolitan Houston area.

   A former Army sergeant responsible for
safeguarding sensitive documents was arrested on charges he
conspired to sell information on the nuclear defense of Europe to
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the FBI said.
   ``This represents a hemorrhage of extremely sensitive information
which caused grave danger to the United States and its NATO
allies,'' FBI agent Allen McCreight said. ``We think it has major
implications.''
   Roderick James Ramsay, 28, was arrested without incident Thursday
night on a downtown street; he being held at an undisclosed
location. He was scheduled to appear today before a federal
magistrate.
   The FBI has been investigating Ramsay for about two years and has
conducted a covert surveillance of him for some time, said a law
enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, a Justice Department spokesman said that the
information that Ramsay is accused of helping provide the Hungarian
and Czech spy agencies eventually fell into the hands of the Soviet
KGB.
   ``This is a significant case from the point of view of U.S.
security interests,'' said spokesman Doug Tillett. ``It involves an
extensive amount of information provided to the Soviet intelligence
service (KBG) through Eastern European surrogates''
   Ramsay worked in West Germany from 1983 to 1985 directly under
Clyde Lee Conrad, 43, a retired U.S. Army sergeant convicted of
treason by a West German court and given a life sentence earlier
this week, the FBI said. It said Ramsay's arrest stemmed from the
investigation of Conrad.
   An affidavit filed in court noted that in January 1986 Conrad
visited Ramsay in Boston, gave him a cow bell and told him that
anyone displaying a similar cow bell was involved in the spy ring.
Ramsay said he kept the bell and had it at his mother's Tampa home
until April, when he turned it over to federal authorities, said an
affidavit signed by FBI agent Joe Navarro.
   Ramsay acknowledged to Navarro that he was recruited by Conrad
and participated in spying activities while in the Army, the
affidavit said. He also told the agent that he had top-secret
documents at his mother's house that he had planned to sell in the
future, Navarro said, but destroyed them in August 1988.
   Ramsay was charged with conspiracy to gather or deliver defense
information to aid a foreign government, the FBI said.
   That information included sensitive documents on the use of
tactical nuclear weapons by U.S. forces and NATO allies, and plans
for the defense of Central Europe, the Justice Department said in a
news release.
   ``It's fair to say the information would have been very useful to
the Soviet Union,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman said. He refused to
confirm whether the East bloc countries passed it on to the Soviets.
   FBI agents said the seven-year nationwide investigation into the
alleged spy ring was continuing. They refused to say how many people
were involved.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation was one
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau,
and the information passed on was ``extremely sensitive.''
   Court papers filed in the case charge that for $20,000 Ramsay
gave Conrad the documents as well as technical manuals about
military communications technology and material about the
coordination of NATO forces.
   The material was passed to Hungarian and Czechoslovakian
intelligence agents, according to the court papers.
   Ramsay worked directly under Conrad in the 8th Infantry Division
G-3 plans section in Bad Kreuznach as the assistant document
custodian. The G-3 section of a division is in charge of the unit's
military operations.
   Ramsay's duties included safeguarding all classified and military
documents. He held a top-secret clearance.
   The affidavit charged that in December 1985, Ramsay videotaped
hundreds of documents and gave them to Conrad for their eventual
sale to the Czechs and Hungarians.
   Conrad was arrested in August 1988. The trial judge in his case
said his offense _ passing secrets to Hungary and Czechoslovakia
from 1975 through 1985 in return for $1.2 million _ ``endangered the
entire defense capability of the West.''
   It could have led to ``a breakdown in the defenses of the Western
alliance,'' and to ``capitulation and the use of nuclear weapons on
German territory,'' said Ferdinand Schuth, chief judge of the court
in the West German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where the spying
occurred.
   According to court records, Conrad was introduced to the
Hungarian secret service in late fall 1975 by his supervisor in the
8th Infantry Division, former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Zoltan Szabo.
   Szabo was convicted of espionage in Austria in 1989 and received
a 10-month suspended sentence. He identified for investigators some
of the documents the court said Conrad sold to the Hungarians.
   Ramsay faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment if convicted
of espionage conspiracy.

   A giant Titan 4 rocket thundered into
orbit Friday with what's believed to be a military surveillance
satellite. Air Force officials said the early morning launch went
smoothly.
   It was the second launch of the nation's most powerful unmanned
space rocket and one of three planned for this year.
   ``Everything went very well. It was a beautiful sight to
behold,'' said Air Force Col. Frank Stirling, director of the Titan
program. ``It was a great step for us in the Air Force to get the
second Titan 4 launched on time as planned.''
   The $173 million rocket blasted off at 1:22 a.m. from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station. It resembled a large ball of fire as it
cut through clouds on its way toward an undisclosed orbit.
   The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight
until it issued a statement about 20 minutes after liftoff. The
payload was not revealed, but civilian experts believe it is an
electronic eavesdropping satellite or a missile-warning spacecraft.
   A Titan 4 successfully boosted a missile-warning satellite into
orbit in June 1989, even though an engine nozzle malfunctioned.
Stirling said the problem was corrected and did not occur in
Friday's launch.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1 billion contract
with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for
eight more. The goal is to have 75 by the end of 1997, which would
put the cost of the program at $17 billion, Stirling said.
   The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to serve as a
complimentary launch vehicle to NASA's manned space shuttle, the
most powerful cargo carrier used by the United States.
   The shuttle is capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into
orbit. The Titan 4, which stands 20 stories tall, can lift a
39,000-pound cargo into low Earth orbit or carry 10,000 pounds to
stationary orbit 22,300 miles high.
   After the 1986 Challenger explosion, the Air Force revamped the
program and targeted the Titan 4 as its primary booster for heavy
Pentagon payloads.
   Stirling said the switch from ``an off-the-shelf'' rocket to one
of shuttle caliber led to schedule delays and a $209 million in cost
overruns as of July 1989.
   The U.S. General Accounting Office cited program delays and cost
overruns in a report last month, noting that 10 rockets originally
were to have been launched by October.
   The rocket launched Friday could have gone up several months ago,
but its payload was not ready, Stirling said.
   The Air Force plans to launch two more Titan 4 rockets this year
from either Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg, Stirling said. Several
rockets are at each site, ready to go, he said.
   Smaller rockets such as the Delta and Atlas will be used to carry
lighter payloads, Stirling said. The space shuttle will be used only
if astronauts' assistance or the shuttle's unique capabilities are
required, he said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret military payload into
orbit next month. It will be the seventh shuttle mission dedicated
to the Defense Department; only a few remain on the shuttle flight
manifest.
   ``Right now, the idea is to have a robust and capable launch
vehicle program that stands alone, based on a mixed fleet, so we
never get into a posture again of having to rely on a single means
of access to space which is in many regards technically fragile,''
Stirling said.

<HEAD>Explorers Enter First of Eight Icebound Aircraft</HEAD>

   Explorers shimmied through a 42-inch hole to poke
around one of eight icebound World War II aircraft in southeastern
Greenland for the first time and found it in good condition,
expedition officials said Friday.
   Richard Taylor, who is supervising the the Greenland Expedition
Society's effort to recover the planes, radioed the society's
suburban Atlanta headquarters:
   ``We have been down to the plane and gotten inside it. Its
condition is good and just as we all hoped it would be.''
   Taylor and Gordon Scott entered the B-17 bomber Wednesday, Pat
Epps, the society's founder, said Friday.
   On Wednesday, Epps said the group succeeded in reaching the plane
for the first time and would try to get inside by descending 250
feet through a 42-inch shaft in the ice.
   The B-17 bomber is one of eight U.S. planes _ two B-17s and six
twin-engine, P-138 Lightning fighters _ that crash-landed on the
Greenland icecap on July 15, 1942. They ran out of fuel en route to
Europe after being given false radio transmissions from German
submarines. The crews survived.
   Epps, owner of an air service in suburban Atlanta, said the
salvage team, which has been in Greenland since May, reached the
buried bomber by digging through 250 feet of ice with a thermal
borer.
   ``We plan to get the fighters out this year,'' he said. ``We will
work until September 1.''
   The Greenland Expedition Society has worked to find the aircraft
for almost a decade. In 1988, its members found the planes by using
low-frequency subsurface radar. Last year, they drilled down to the
B-17 and brought back poker chip-size pieces of its skin.

   Scientists have produced a calf with a human
hormone gene and three others with extra cattle genes, in research
that could lead to leaner beef and cows that give more milk.
   The three bulls and one heifer were given the extra genes while
still embryos as part of a continuing project at the Diamond G Ranch
in southeast Texas.
   In addition, 60 to 70 cows at the ranch are pregnant with
genetically altered embryos.
   ``I'm not willing to say any of the animals we have produced or
those we're about to produce will have commercial value,'' said Ken
Bondioli, a senior scientist at Granada BioSciences of Houston.
``This is research in its infancy. There's a lot of potential there.
We don't think we have all the answers.''
   The human gene is carried by the eldest of Granada's experimental
cattle, a 15-month-old bull, researchers said Thursday. The animal
has not grown as large as researchers anticipated, but they still
hope the gene altering could lead to strong, healthy cattle without
the use of steroids.
   Steroids have been linked to heart disease and impotence.
   ``The purpose of these kinds of things is to prevent disease,
make animals more immune to particular kinds of diseases,'' said
David Eller, Granada's chairman. ``In the broad analysis, it's to
make food-producing animals more economical for producers to grow
and more healthy for the diet-conscious, health-conscious consumers
of today.''
   Researchers have experimented successfully with gene altering in
chickens, pigs, sheep and laboratory animals. Human genes have also
been previously inserted into farm animals.
   But the Granada experiments are believed to be the first
performed on cattle in the United States. Gene-altered cows have
been produced in Europe and Canada.
   The testing is being done by Biondoli, Bert O'Malley, a cell
biologist at Houston's Bayor College of Medicine; and Robert Hammer,
a physiologist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Dallas.
   To produce their first genetically engineered bull, the
scientists used a human estrogen gene, reproduced in the lab, to
promote growth. The hope was that an animal with the extra gene
would enjoy the same benefits steroids provide without the health
risks.
   The first bull, however, did not show any abnormally fast or
healthy growth.
   A second bull was born last September; a heifer was born three
months later. The fourth, a bull, was born last March. These three
calves received additional bovine genes.
   The two bulls received an insulin-growth factor gene, designed to
promote growth. The cow received a growth hormone gene, which the
scientists hope will promote milk production.

   Radio actor Michael Raffetto, who played
the original Paul Barbour on ``One Man's Family'' during the 1930s
and '40s, has died. He was 91.
   Raffetto died May 31, his family said Thursday. No cause of death
was given.
   Raffetto played the eldest son of Henry and Frances Barbour on
``One Man's Family,'' among radio's longest running and most popular
programs.
   From its initial broadcast on April 29, 1932, until May 8, 1959,
``One Man's Family'' was heard regularly on NBC. Raffetto left the
show in 1956.
   Raffetto played a fighter pilot who was wounded in World War I
and whose bride had died in a flu epidemic.
   Beginning in 1939, Raffetto also played globe trotter and
soft-spoken hero Jack Packard on ``I Love a Mystery,'' a radio
program popular during the Depression and World War II.
   Raffetto was born in Placerville. He graduated from the
University of California, Berkeley, in 1925 and practiced law
briefly in San Francisco.
   He returned to Berkeley as a drama teacher and directed at Los
Angeles' Greek Theatre in the late 1920s.
   In 1930, he starred in and produced NBC's ``Arm of the Law.'' He
went on to become the network's West Coast program director and join
the ``Family'' cast.
   His other radio credits included ``Death Valley Days'' and
``Attorney for the Defense.''
   Raffetto made a few silent films in his youth, including
``Tillie's Punctured Romance.'' He also had a small part in ``A
Foreign Affair'' with Marlene Dietrich in 1948 and ``Storm Center''
with Bette Davis in 1956.
   In his later years, Raffetto lived in Europe, where he wrote
novels and short stories. He returned to Berkeley in 1960.
   He is survived by his wife, Constance, four daughters and five
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A Texas businessman stung in a federal
crackdown on child labor law violations cautioned Congress Friday
against letting ``governmental paternalism'' ruin worthwhile work
opportunities for youngsters.
   Donald Farrell said jobs like those he provides give youngsters,
especially those from unstable homes, a chance to earn money,
experience and self-respect. The Dallas business Farrell owns is
under investigation for allegedly letting nearly 300 children
illegally sell newspaper subscriptions at night.
   ``Please do not allow misguided idealism and governmental
paternalism to close that door. They desperately need an alternative
to the street corner and the dangers associated with that
irresponsible lifestyle,'' Farrell told the House Government
Operations employment and housing subcommittee.
   Farrell faces $150,000 in fines for alleged violations uncovered
in a nationwide Labor Department sweep in March. He was one of
several business officials who testified as the panel continued
hearings on protecting children in the workplace.
   Executives from McDonald's, Burger King and Domino's pizza said
they had implemented programs to ensure that young employees do not
work in violation of federal law. Youngsters may only work
restricted hours and are prohibited from working at dangerous
machines such as paper balers, dough machines and meat slicers.
   Two high school students also testified, saying their grades had
slipped because they were devoting too much time to their jobs.
   Christopher Randolph, a senior from Clifton Park, N.Y., said
teen-agers were ``easy marks for exploitation.''
   ``Our natural naivete and intuitive trust of adults makes us easy
prey,'' said Randolph, adding that his former restaurant job
frequently kept him at work until 11 p.m., two hours beyond the
legal time.
   Congress is considering legislation to increase civil fines for
child labor law violations from $1,000 a violation to $10,000. The
legislation also would require jail terms for repeat and willful
offenders.
   Along with congressional attention, the Labor Department has
stepped up its enforcement. The nationwide sweep conducted in March
uncovered 15,000 alleged violations. Federal agents followed with a
one-day effort this week by visiting another 2,000 establishments.

   A judge ordered the press and public
out of his courtroom Friday while hearing arguments on key evidence
in the case against two brothers charged with the shotgun slayings
of their parents.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht closed a hearing on the
question of whether the records of a psychiatrist who treated Erik
and Lyle Menendez are admissable evidence.
   Gerald Chaleff, attorney for Lyle Menendez, asked that the
hearing be held in secret, saying that it concerned matters of the
psychiatrist's privilege and could not be held in public without
violating that privilege.
   ``I apologize for these in camera (closed) proceedings'' Albracht
told reporters and spectators in the crowded courtroom. ``I hope you
can understand the reason for closing some of these proceedings.
Privilege would not matter much if we had to discuss those
privileged matters in public.''
   Albracht said, however, that the material discussed in tape
recordings seized from the doctor have never been disclosed to him
because of their sensitivity.
   ``I think freedom of the press is very important,'' he said after
several reporters raised their hands and asked to be heard on the
issue. ``But I've given this a lot of thought and we simply cannot
proceed in public when we discuss matters of privilege.''
   The brothers are accused of murdering Jose Menendez, 45, and his
wife, Kitty, 44, in the family's Beverly Hills mansion on Aug. 20.
The couple was hit numerous times with shotgun blasts.
   Menendez was a wealthy executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a
video distribution firm.
   The brothers said they found the bodies of their parents when
they returned home from a night out. Prosecutors allege the brothers
were motivated to kill their parents to claim their father's fortune.

<HEAD>Nearly Empty Chamber is Last Straw for Senate Majority Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sight of a nearly empty Senate chamber
Friday proved the last straw for Majority Leader George J. Mitchell.
   The Maine Democrat announced to a half dozen of his
$98,000-a-year colleagues and about four times as many tourists that
he was going to force some elected noses to the grindstone. Other
senators were milling about elsewhere in the Capitol.
   ``We're just reaching the point where it is very, very difficult
to move forward on any piece of legislation,'' said Mitchell. The
man who is supposed to make things happen in the Senate couldn't
force completion of action on any of four bills on his menu this
week.
   The frustration over absences, delays, filibusters and endless
amendments had been building.
   ``It is intolerable that the Senate cannot function if one of a
few Senators have something else to do on one of the three days of
the week of the three weeks of the month that the Senate is supposed
to be in session and working,'' he said Thursday after trying to
juggle next week's voting schedule.
   Senators have quit holding votes on Mondays and Fridays,
presumably so they can visit with the people who elected them.
Friday was an exception that Mitchell is suggesting he might make
permanent.
   The majority leader is threatening to make Mondays and Fridays
voting days, hold votes in the morning, make lawmakers burn the
midnight oil other than on Thursdays, and cut into the four-week
August recess.
   He didn't mention having the sergeant-at-arms make midnight
arrests and physically carry reluctant lawmakers to the Senate
floor. Democrats under former Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia resorted to that tactic in February 1988.
   Mitchell said he understood that two senators were in
Czechoslovakia to monitor elections and others were attending
graduations. And he said he understood the need for senators to
sound out their constituents for advice.
   ``But those actions are not a substitute for, but in connection
with and in preparation for activity which occurs on the Senate
floor. ... All other considerations must give way to that overriding
public consideration.''
   Sen. Robert Dole, the minority leader, told Mitchell that he
could lead senators to the floor but couldn't make them pass bills.
   ``I think I tried them all but none of them worked,'' said Dole,
who was once majority leader. Being on the floor ``doesn't mean
we're going to do anything in that time.''
   Dole argued that the minority Republicans have their own view of
what legislation is important and must use the available tactics _
such as filibusters and offering irrelevant amendments _ to affect
the flow of bills.
   The Senate this past week was unable to complete action on a
crime-fighting measure, a bill to change timber management at the
Tongass national forest in Alaska, an override of the presidential
veto of the Amtrak authorizing bill, and a bill to let blind airline
passengers sit in exit-row seats.
   The Senate still has to deal with major pieces of legislation
like the budget, defense, civil rights, and farm programs.

   Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis

Socialist government of his predecessor, Andreas Papandreou.
   ``My government intends to end the friction in relations with
Washington that was evident during the eight years of Socialist rule
in Greece,'' said Mitsotakis, whose meeting with Bush was the first
visit by a Greek leader to the White House in 26 years.
   U.S. officials say relations with Greece have already improved
since the conservative prime minister came to power in April.
   Mitsotakis, a newspaper publisher and veteran politician, said he
had told Bush and other U.S. leaders that at a time when the Soviet
Union has pulled out of Afghanistan and South Africa had withdrawn
from Namibia, Turkey's continued occupation of Cyprus ``is a
terrible blot on the reputation of the entire Western alliance. ...''
   Mitsotakis addressed reporters and members of the Greek community
at a National Press Club luncheon before departing for New York.
   Turkey invaded the Mediterranean island in 1974 in what it
described as a move to protect the Cypriot Turkish community from
the Greek majority. Cyprus has been divided into two regions with a
U.N. force keeping the peace.
   ``The members of NATO, and especially the United States, can do
much to end the Cyprus crisis and the time is now,'' he said.
   U.N. efforts begun last year to start peace talks between the
sides have failed to progress.
   The United States has refused to become involved in the feud
between Greece and Turkey, both members of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, preferring to let the United Nations
mediate. Bush discussed the issue this week at a White House
luncheon with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Mitsotakis said he had made clear to the United States his
government's desire to resolve the Cyprus problem in order to
improve ties with Turkey. But, he added, the United States has it in
its power to press Turkey into changing its policies.
   The Greek premier said he had told Bush his government would
decide before the end of September whether to extradite Mohammed
Rashid, a Palestinian wanted here in connection with a 1982 Pan Am
bombing. The case has been stalled by Papandreou's government.
   ``In any case, we will never let Rashid free,'' he promised.
   Mitsotakis said that Rashid would either be handed over to the
United States or put on trial in Greece.

Allegheny ants make largest mounds sted are largest ants</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ARNOLD, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Merica doesn't want to make a mountain
out of a molehill, but he did discover what a Harvard researcher
says is one of the nation's largest anthills.
   Merica was walking down a road last month in this small town
south of Baltimore when he saw what appeared to a moving mound of
dirt.
   ``I thought the sun was playing tricks on me when I looked at
it,'' said Merica.
   ``At first I thought the whole hill was moving, but then I looked
up close and, my God, it was just solid ants! It was unbelievable!''
   About 500,000 Allegheny ants constructed the 3-foot high,
8-by-15-foot oval mound, which is the largest in a six-mound area
connected by a 115-yard ``ant highway.''
   ``I've spent a lot of time in the woods camping and hunting and
whatever, and I have never seen anything like it,'' Merica said.
   Merica reported his find to state and county officials.
   Harvard University researcher Stefan Cover said it probably took
the ants at least four years to build the mound.
   Some termites are known to build larger nests in the tropics, but
the Allegheny ants build the largest mounds in the United States and
among the largest in the world, said Cover, an assistant curator of
the world's largest ant collection, at Harvard. He said the largest
Allegheny mound he has even seen was 8 feet across.
   State entomologist Gaye Williams identified the Arnold ants as
Formica exsectoides, a harmless species native to Maryland.
   ``It's a very nice ant, very handsome and very strong. But it is
of no importance other than as a curiosity,'' said Williams, who
studies, plays with and even eats insects, as well as occasionally
wearing jewelry made of them.
   The individual ants look like common red ants, about a
quarter-inch long with red heads and bodies and black bottoms.
   Cover explained that the ants are able to build such enormous
colonies because, unlike most ants, they do not harbor tribal
prejudices.
   ``In most ant species, queens are intolerant of other queens, and
the separate nests compete with one another for food. But with
exsectoides the mounds can contain 30 or 40 queens working
together,'' Cover said.
   The separate mounds even cooperate and seem to communicate with
each other, forming a sort of United Nations of the ant world, he
said.

<HEAD>NRC Concludes Plant Vogtle Accident Could Have Been Prevented</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigation
concluded Friday that an accident that cut electrical power to
safety systems at a Georgia nuclear power plant last March could
have been prevented.
   But investigators praised operators at Plant Vogtle near
Waynesboro, Ga., for restoring power to a reactor's cooling system
within 36 minutes after a truck accident knocked out one power
system and a backup generator failed twice to kick in automatically.
   ``My personal opinion is we ought to congratulate those
operators,'' NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr said after the special
investigative team briefed the commission on its findings.
   ``They were operating without a full deck of cards ... and they
did a heroic job to get it back in 36 minutes,'' he said.
   The accident occurred March 20 while the plant's Unit 1 reactor
was shut down for refueling. Two of the four electric power sources
for Unit 1 safety systems were out of service at the time, and the
reactor's cooling system was open for maintenance.
   A fuel delivery truck knocked out one of the two remaining power
sources when it backed into a support column in an electrical
switchyard at the plant. During the 36 minutes it took to get the
backup diesel generator started, the temperature in the reactor
cooling system increased from 90 to 136 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The accident also triggered an automatic shutdown of the Unit 2
reactor, which was operating at full power, because of a wiring
error that had gone undetected since the plant was constructed.
   Carr said there never was ``any real serious danger'' that the
loss of the Unit 1 reactor cooling system would have damaged the
reactor core and resulted in a release of radioactivity. But he said
the incident can provide lessons to improve the safety of nuclear
plants.
   Ken McCoy, Georgia Power Co. vice president in charge of Plant
Vogtle, agreed with Carr's assessment and with the investigative
team's conclusion that the accident could have been prevented.
   ``I never felt uncomfortable that there was ever any real threat
of a release of radioactive material,'' McCoy said. ``The operators
were well trained and they did an outstanding job of getting the
unit back on line.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Reiterates Warning To Curb Jewish Emigration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday reiterated
warnings that he will curb the emigration of Soviet Jews unless they
stop settling in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``This is a very serious matter,'' Gorbachev said. He urged
Israel to heed his warnings against West Bank and Gaza Strip
settlements made during last week's summit in Washington.
   ``I hope that Israel will listen and then ... this process (of
Jewish emigration) can go on normally and we won't be forced to
introduce any corrections,'' Gorbachev told a news conference.
   ``If the situation became such that we have to react, we probably
will have to apply our sovereign rights, our competence, and act,''
he said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who was visiting
Moscow, joined Gorbachev at the news conference. Answering an Arab
journalist, said settlement of Soviet Jewish emigres on the West
Bank was wrong. She said Israel, not Gorbachev, was to blame.
   ``It is wrong that people who leave the Soviet Union should be
placed in the occupied territories which we really regard as
belonging to someone else and not the state of Israel,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher.
   ``I think it is almost letting down those of us who have
campaigned vigorously'' for Jewish emigration rights.
   A record number of Jews are leaving the Soviet Union following
Gorbachev's lifting of emigration curbs.
   Israel says some 35,000 Soviet Jews have arrived this year and as
many as 150,000 are expected, but that only ``a few hundred'' have
so far settled in the West Bank.
   Israel says it has no policy of directing Soviet Jews to the
occupied territories, where there are some 1.7 million Palestinians
and about 70,000 Jewish settlers. The Palestinian uprising against
the 23-year-old occupation is now 2{ years old.

<HEAD>State of Emergency Lifted Except in Natal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 4-year-old state of
emergency was lifted everywhere in the country Friday but in a
region torn by black factional fighting, and a black union demanded
the emergency be ended there too.
   President F.W. de Klerk announced Thursday the emergency would
end at midnight Friday in three of the country's four provinces.
   The action removes some of the harshest political restrictions
ever imposed by the country's white rulers and should help clear the
way for black-white negotiations on ending apartheid.
   The end of the emergency ``is an important step in the
normalization of our society and is an illustration of the
government's declared policy to affirm the rule of law in a
democratic South Africa,'' said Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee.
   But in the eastern province of Natal and the adjoining KwaZulu
homeland, police still have sweeping powers to detain people without
charge and break up demonstrations.
   The government had indicated it would keep the measures in effect
in Natal, and it formally announced the decision Friday in the
official Government Gazette.
   Black factional fighting has claimed more than 4,000 lives in
Natal since 1986. About 500 people were killed in clashes during
first three months of this year.
   The country's largest black labor federation criticized the
government for extending the emergency decree in Natal, saying it
was a pretext for police to continue abusing blacks.
   ``Our experience of the state of emergency in Natal is that it
has provided a cover for the security forces ... to terrorize the
people,'' said the Congress of South African Trade Unions, which is
allied with the African National Congress.
   ``Retaining the state of emergency in Natal can only worsen the
conflict, not resolve it,'' the federation said.
   The ANC, the country's most powerful black organization, has also
condemned the retention of the state of emergency in Natal.
   The main combatants in Natal are supporters of the ANC and
members of Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization.
   The ANC has said that in order for there to be black-white
negotiations on a new constitution, the government must lift the
state of emergency, release political prisoners and allow exiles to
return.
   De Klerk wants to work out a constitution with opposition groups
that will lead to sharing of power between the 5 million whites and
28 million blacks, who under apartheid have no voice in national
affairs.
   Meanwhile, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party said the end of
the state of emergency in Cape, Transvaal and Orange Free State
provinces would lead to chaos and further alienate right-wing whites
disgruntled with de Klerk's reforms.
   Conservative leader Andries Treunicht said the government should
have required the ANC to renounce its armed struggle against
apartheid before the state of emergency was lifted.
   But leading newspapers praised de Klerk's decision.
   The Cape Times said the action will have ``a steadying effect at
home, while once more demonstrating to the world (de Klerk's) firm
commitment to a negotiated settlement.''
   ``Even for the cynics, the lifting of the state of emergency will
mean more space, however small, has been cleared for political
activity,'' said the Sowetan, a black-oriented newspaper.
   During the national emergency, more than 30,000 activists, most
of them black, were detained without charge for varying lengths of
time. Thousands more went into hiding after former President P.W.
Botha imposed the restrictions on June 12, 1986.
   About 300 activists were being held under the emergency
regulations as of Friday, most of them in Natal.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters cast ballots Friday in
Czechoslovakia's first free elections following four decades of
Communist rule, bringing democracy to their country only months
after the overthrow of their hard-line rulers.
   President Vaclav Havel, the former dissident playwright elected
by Parliament in December after a peaceful revolution, was loudly
cheered as he walked with his wife Olga from his central Prague home
to vote.
   Jostled by the crowd of about 200 people as the couple emerged
from the polling station minutes later, Olga was asked how it felt
to vote freely.
   ``Beautiful,'' she said.
   Voters dressed in their Sunday best turned out in moderate
numbers across Prague for the two-day election to choose the 300
deputies that will sit in a new federal Parliament. Also at stake
were seats for the regional Parliaments in the Czech and Slovak
republics.
   The new Parliament will choose a president, and it is expected to
elect Havel. Parliament's chief task during its two-year term is to
rewrite the constitution.
   That will mean dealing with rising separatist sentiment in
Slovakia, where many would like to see a looser alliance replace the
federation of Czech and Slovak republics set up by the Communists in
1968.
   The first of the 11.2 million registered voters to cast their
ballots were the coal miners of Ostrava, a mining and industrial
center on the Polish border long known as a bastion of Stalinism.
   Their polling stations opened two hours ahead of the 2 p.m. (8
a.m. EDT) start of voting so their mining shifts would not be
disrupted.
   Polls close at 2 p.m. Saturday, with initial returns expected
later in the afternoon. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
   Civic Forum, the movement founded by Havel to lead last winter's
revolution, and its Slovak partner, Public Against Violence, were
heavily favored to emerge strongest from the voting.
   ``Civic Forum will do well, I'm sure,'' said Havel's spokesman,
Michael Zantovsky, after voting in a Prague suburb.
   Echoing the latest pre-election opinon polls, Zantovsky predicted
that Civic Forum would get about 40 percent of the vote, with the
alliance of Christian Democrats polling about 20 percent nationwide
but doing better in rural Slovakia.
   Asked about the Communists, Zantovsky made a thumbs-down gesture.
``Less than 10 percent,'' he said.
   All the 21 parties contesting the election alongside the
Communists campaigned on a heavily anti-Communist platform.
   The fairly subdued campaign turned acrimonious and even violent
in its final week. A bomb planted by unknown terrorists injured 19
people in Prague on Saturday.
   On Wednesday, a fierce row broke out between the Civic Forum and
the Christian Democrats over the alleged links of a top Christian
Democrat, Josef Bartoncik, with the hated Communist secret police.
   Both the Civic Forum and the Christian Democrats have said a
coalition with the Communists is unlikely after the election. But
former or reformed Communists who have worked in the interim
``government of national understanding'' forged by the revolution
may keep their posts.
   Havel, 53, who before last winter's revolution was a reluctant
candidate for office, has clearly grown into his post and enjoyed
both guiding his country toward democracy and helping to reshape the
order of a changing Europe.
   ``I liked him as a dissident, and I like him even more as a
president,'' said Havel's neighbor, Zdenek Zadnik, 64, one of the
crowd waiting to see Havel vote.
   During the voting, authorities banned the sale of alcohol except
beer and posted police at public places, from polling stations to
post offices.
   For young people who had never voted, and older citizens who
thought democracy had vanished in the 1930s with the Nazis and again
in 1948 with the Communist takeover, the balloting was a dream come
true.
   ``I didn't hope to see free elections again,'' said Milena
Jirotova, 68.
   ``It's a new feeling,'' said Katrina Hauffova, 20. The old
Communist order ``seemed unchanging,'' she added. ``I couldn't
imagine anything like this. Elections always seemed so controlled.''
   Asked what outcome she'd like to see, she smiled and said, ``Five
percent for the Communists.''

<HEAD>Educators Strongly Differ on Free-Market Reform Idea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educators on Friday praised as ``perestroika''
or criticized as detrimental a proposal to deregulate public
education and allow students to use tax-funded ``scholarships'' to
attend the school of their choice.
   ``American education is about as effective as Russian agriculture
and it operates in much the same way. What they are doing is
redefining public education,'' said Michael Guerra of the National
Catholic Educational Association.
   Guerra was referring to a Brookings Institution study that has
heightened an already intense debate over how much control parents
should have in selecting schools for their children.
   Authors John Chubb, a senior fellow at Brookings, and Stanford
University political scientist Terry Moe studied various education
reform programs, declared them unsuccessful and called for an end to
government operation of schools in favor of an entirely new system
based on free enterprise. Schools would compete for students in the
open-market by providing genuine educational choices for parents and
children.
   Chubb and Moe said their recommendations result from a 10-year
nationwide study of American high schools, considered the largest of
its kind ever conducted. They studied academic achievement using
surveys of more than 20,000 principals, teachers and students at
some 500 high schools nationwide.
   Under the Chubb-Moe plan, each school would determine its own
governing structure and the state could not dictate a school's
internal organization. A community ``Office of Choice'' would
dispense funds, while a ``Center for Parental Information'' would
counsel parents.
   ``What they are proposing involves radical change. They are
talking about `perestroika' for American education,'' said Guerra,
using the term referring to reforms in the Soviet Union.
   While the idea is being billed as radical, even revolutionary,
Myron Lieberman noted that a similar idea was espoused in 1962 by
economist Milton Friedman and in his own book published last year.
   ``The major weakness ... is in singling out the marketplace as
the answer,'' said Lieberman. ``There is more than one feasible way
of applying a market system to education,'' he added, pointing to
the idea of allowing schools to contract out various areas of
instruction.
   Walter Cooper, a regent of the University of the State of New
York, said the authors may be ``overrating the potential for the
entrepreneurial spirit.''
   Gary Watts of the National Education Association called the
proposal impractical. Thomas Shannon, executive director of the
National School Boards Association, predicted government would
expand ``given the huge amounts of public money involved and the
natural proclivity of legislators to regulate _ all within an
emotionally charged environment when dealing with citizens'
children, their rights and their tax money.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
agreed with the authors that ``the present governance structure of
public education forces schools to respond to or protect the myriad
interests of diverse pressure groups.
   ``It's no surprise that the result is excessive bureaucratization
and educational gridlock,'' he said. ``Required to do just about
everything, schools often find themselves unable to do anything very
well.''
   But Shanker said the authors ``never consider the possibility of
changing the legal functions or roles of school boards so they do
not produce bureaucratic paralysis. And they don't look at the
possibility of moving school control to some other level of
government where schools might not be subject to the same pressures
they now face.''
   ``There's a lot to commend,'' said Shanker. ``But to think that
if we only changed the governance structure of education to a market
model _ or anything else for that matter _ we'd solve the problems
in our schools is a fantasy.''

   A judge Friday ordered Dr. Jack Kevorkian
to stop using his suicide machine until prosecutors decide whether
to try him for letting an Alzheimer's patient use the device.
   Oakland County Circuit Judge Alice Gilbert also enjoined the
62-year-old retired pathologist from helping people use any other
means to kill themselves. The temporary orders are effective
statewide, assistant prosecutor Michael Modelski said.
   Kevorkian, who acted as his own attorney, had asked the judge to
allow him to set up a team of ``Untouchables'' to help terminally
ill people end their lives.
   On Monday, Kevorkian assisted in the suicide of Janet Adkins, a
54-year-old Portland, Ore., woman who had been diagnosed as being in
the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
   Modelski said there were no immediate plans to prosecute
Kevorkian, but an investigation was continuing.
   Kevorkian had asked the judge for a partial injunction, instead
of the full stop order sought by prosecutors, to allow use of his
machine in ``a specific set of circumstances.''
   He said he wanted time to set up a committee of specialists to
establish a permanent ``planned death policy'' for when to use the
machine. He said he also wanted to set up an ``obitorium,'' a clinic
for the terminally ill who want medical help with suicide.
   ``Let me put together a small team, called the Untouchables,''
Kevorkian told a media-packed courtroom. ``I guarantee, under my
supervision, it would be incorruptible.''
   Modelski questioned the judgment of Kevorkian's suggested clinic
involving a person who is physically well but mentally ill.
   ``It's got to be a medical decision. I've had many healthy people
call me, begging to get them out of their misery,'' Kevorkian said,
adding the clinic would focus on people with incurable diseases.
   Kevorkian created an intravenous device that he hooked up to Mrs.
Adkins at her request. It allowed her to press a button that fed
coma- and death-inducing drugs into her bloodstream.
   The county prosecutor, state police and state medical association
are investigating, although Michigan has no specific law against
suicide or assisting in it.
   ``If my medical license is revoked, I will build another one and
still help patients, but not as a physician,'' Kevorkian said in
court.
   Kevorkian said his colleagues have been in the Dark Ages in
opposing doctor-assisted suicide.
   ``I'm sure if they could they would burn me at the stake,''
Kevorkian testified, often glancing around the courtroom at
reporters.
   Kevorkian's sister, Flora Holzheimer of Frankfurt, West Germany,
testified that she drove Mrs. Adkins to the Oakland County park
where she committed suicide.
   Holzheimer spent Saturday evening before the suicide with her
brother, Mrs. Adkins and Mrs. Adkins' husband, Ronald.
   Each time her health faltered, ``she died a thousand deaths,''
Holzheimer said of Mrs. Adkins. ``Someone said to her, `Janet,
you're just getting there before us.' She said, `I know' and
smiled.''
   Also subpoenaed for Friday's hearing was another sister of
Kevorkian's, Margo Janus of Troy, who reportedly was present during
the suicide in the back of the doctor's Volkswagen van.
   A survey published Friday found wide support for medically
assisted suicide for the terminally ill. Two-thirds of 724 adults
surveyed this week by telephone believed medical facilities should
be available to help the terminally ill end their lives.
   The USA Today poll, with a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points, also found 28 percent feel Kevorkian should be
prosecuted and 43 percent said he shouldn't be punished for helping
Mrs. Adkins.

   A court on Friday convicted a London man of
conspiracy in an IRA bombing campaign in Britain and sentenced him
to 30 years in prison.
   Nicholas Mullen was charged in connection with one of the biggest
caches of terrorist equipment ever found in Britain. The stockpile
of arms and explosives was discovered in London in 1988.
   Justice Anthony Hidden, said Mullen, 42, was ``a very dangerous
man.''
   ``You combine a high degree of criminal cunning with a commitment
to a particular cause. That cause deals not with arguments but with
atrocities,'' Hidden said.
   The Old Bailey Central Criminal Court jury deliberated 12 hours
before finding Mullen guilty of conspiracy to cause bombings for his
part in the Irish Republican Army's 1988 bombing campaign.
   Eamon Wadley, 36, also on trial for terrorist offenses, was
cleared of all charges.
   Police accidentally discovered the arms and explosives stockpile
in south London in December 1988 after a man was shot in the stomach
in a disturbance on the street in front of an apartment complex.
   The gunman ran into the complex, and a search of the area found
an apartment filled with terrorist equipment, including nearly 200
pounds of Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosive, an unspecified number
of machine guns and other firearms, rifles, handguns, and
bomb-making equipment.
   During the six-week trial the jury heard how Mullen helped the
IRA by renting apartments, buying used cars and obtaining false
identities for the guerillas.
   However, the Old Bailey jury found Wadley innocent of aiding
terrorists, and he was acquitted of four charges of making property
available for use in connection with terrorism.
   Prosecutor John Nutting called the south London apartment ``one
of biggest caches of terrorist equipment ever found in this
country.''
   The prosecutor said that if the plot had not been unexpectedly
foiled, the IRA's campaign would ``certainly have led to the death
or injury of many people.''
   The IRA is waging a bloody fight to drive the British out of the
predominantly Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite it
with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

   President Bush said Friday he is considering
breaking off talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization after
the ``sheer terror'' of a thwarted Palestinian attack on an Israeli
beach.
   In Washington, a senior administration official said he expected
a 30-day suspension of the talks, though he said no final decision
had been made and outright termination of contacts also was possible.
   Bush called on PLO leader Yasser Arafat to publicly renounce the
attack and suggested the continuation of U.S.-PLO contacts depended
on Arafat's response.
   ``Our dialogue is predicated on a renunciation of terror. In my
view, this was sheer terror,'' Bush said.
   Asked if, as several news reports have suggested, he were
considering breaking off the talks begun in December 1988, Bush said
``We are discussing all of that. No decision has been made. ... I'm
not prepared to make an announcement on policy at this point.''
   
   
   In his first public comments on the matter, Bush criticized
Arafat for refusing to condemn last week's attack on the Israeli
coastline by the Palestine Liberation Front, one the PLO's
constituent groups. Arafat has said the PLO was not involved in the
attack but has not condemned it outright.
   Israeli forces intercepted two speedboats filled with Palestinian
fighters near Tel Aviv. Four of the Palestinians were killed and 12
captured. The attack followed the slaying 10 days earlier of seven
Palestinian laborers by an Israeli the government described as
deranged.
   Bush commented aboard Air Force One as he neared the end of a
political fund-raising trip to Midwestern states.
   Shortly before he spoke, Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
in Scotland for a NATO meeting, said the attempted raid ``has to be
taken very seriously.'' But he also said that ``some perspective and
responsibility is required in dealing with the issue'' and that the
Bush administration was seeking more information before deciding on
possible action.
   In Washington, an administration official said the United States
has held at least four meetings with PLO representatives since the
raid to discuss the organization's views on it. The official,
speaking only on condition of anonymity, said no decision on
breaking off talks was likely for a number of days.
   Another senior official said he expects the administration to
suspend the dialogue with the PLO for about 30 days. But he did not
rule out outright termination if the administration concludes that
such a message to the PLO is necessary. He, too, said no decision
had been made.
   Earlier, diplomatic sources in Washington said the United States
would announce suspension of the talks next week. The sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration would
cite the attack and the PLO's decision not to condemn the action.
   Bush said the attempted attack ``was horrendous.''
   ``There was no rationale for it other than, in my view, terror,''
he said.
   Bush said that he had discussed the Middle East peace process
earlier in the day in a telephone conversation with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. ``Both of us are still committed to getting
the peace talks going forward,'' he sid.
   ``I've expressed my outrage about the attack'' last week, he
said. ``Maybe I can take this opportunity to express my outrage
about all the violence in the Middle East.''
   He expressed some pessimism about the progress of peace efforts.
``Every time you get something started, there seems to be some
outbreak,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm still outraged by the holding of U.S. hostages. I have this
on my mind all the time. All of those things have a way of coming
together.''
   On efforts by Yitzhak Shamir, the caretaker prime minister of
Israel, to form a right-wing government, Bush said it was ``an
internal matter for Israel.''
   ``I'll work with whomever that country puts forth as its
government,'' he said.
   Asked if such a government would hamper peace efforts, Bush said
that Israel ``knows the policy of the United States'' in wanting to
get peace talks going between Israel and the Palestinians.
   ``The world is crying out for negotiations on this question,'' he
said.
   U.S. talks with the PLO have been going on intermittently in
Tunis since December 1988 when Arafat renounced terrorism.

<HEAD>Ames Plans to Close 221 Stores, Lay Off About 17,500</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW FRASER</BYLINE>

   The Ames Department Stores Inc., trying to
jettison unprofitable operations, announced plans Friday to close
221 stores and lay off about 17,500 employees as it struggles to
emerge from bankruptcy protection.
   The closings, which represent nearly a third of Ames' 679 stores
nationwide, must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York, where the nation's fourth largest retailer filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankrutpcy laws on April 25.
   ``This is a critical first step towards our primary goal of
leading Ames out of Chapter 11,'' said Stephen L. Pistner, the new
chief executive officer brought in by Ames to steer it through its
current troubles.
   The 221 stores being closed include 33 stores Ames previously
said it would close and 184 former Zayre stores. Analysts have said
Ames' acquisition two years ago of the Zayre chain led to Ames'
downfall.
   Most of the stores being closed are in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,
North Carolina and Florida.
   ``This downsizing will cut our expenses, reduce operating losses
and allow us to focus our efforts on serving our customers,''
Pistner said.
   The 458 stores staying open are mostly in the northeast. The
company employed about 55,000 people at the time of the bankruptcy
filing.
   Ames also plans to close distribution centers in Plant City,
Fla., and Worcester, Mass. The retailer plans to complete
construction of a distribution center in Leesport, Pa., in early
1991, subject to court approval.
   Ames hopes to realize $180 million in cash from liquidation sales
this summer.
   The stores being closed lost about $48 million last year, Pistner
said.
   Ames, which reported losses of $228 million last year, has
attributed its troubles to the sluggish retail market in the
Northeast and to problems with its 1988 acquisition of the 392-store
Zayre chain.
   The $788 million acquisition doubled Ames' size and transformed
the company from a little-known New England-based chain into the
nation's fourth-largest discounter. It has since closed 90 of those
stores and converted others to the Ames name.

   Some practitioners of euthanasia
on Friday defended mercy killing but criticized the inventor of a
suicide machine that an Oregon woman used this week to kill herself.
   The case was discussed here Friday on the second day of the World
Conference of the International Federation of Right-to-Die Societies.
   The 21-nation gathering of physicians, lawyers and right-to-die
activists, was called to consider legal, ethical and psychological
aspects of the right to die.
   Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore. died Monday after using the
suicide machine designed by Dr. Jack Kevorkian of Michigan. She had
been told she was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
   A judge in Michigan on Friday ordered Kevorkian to stop using the
machine until prosecutors decide whether to file chargers in
connection with the Adkins case.
   Herbert Cohen, a Dutch general practitioner also known for his
willingness to perform mercy killing, said Kevorkian had used the
device ``just so he could run away'' from the moral repercussions of
the woman's death.
   Kevorkian's machine makes use of a button-operated intravenous
drip.
   ``Such a machine is no expression of compassion, tenderness or
care,'' Cohen said.
   Dr. Piet Admiraal, one of two Dutch physicians who have
spearheaded a 15-year campaign for the full legalization of
euthanasia here, said he had been approached by Kevorkian about use
of the machine, but rebuffed him.
   ``I tried to explain to him time and again we don't need such a
machine here,'' Admiraal said. ``I prefer to simply inject (the
lethal drugs) myself ... and if the patient prefers to do it we give
him a (euthanasia) drink.''
   In an address to the conference on Friday, Cohen made no direct
reference to the Adkins case. But he urged his colleagues to take
the time to ``sit down, hold hands'' with patients who ask to die.
   ``You cannot ... discuss euthanasia, standing at the foot of the
bed, in a white coat, mumbling Latin incantations,'' Cohen told his
audience.
   Dutch legal and medical authorities widely approve of the
principle that patients be allowed to opt for death when they face
pointless suffering or terminal illness.
   However, mercy killing is still technically on Dutch law books as
a crime carrying a 12-year maximum prison term.

   A West German salesman who provided two East German
agents with commercially available items including dictionaries and
brochures was convicted Friday of spying for a foreign power.
   A special court sentenced Klaus Tscheu, who has lived in France
since 1966, to four years in prison with 18 months suspended. The
seven-judge panel acquitted a co-defendant, Francoise Drouillaut.
   During the two-day trial, Tscheu, 51, said all he furnished to
two East German agents during contacts from May 1982 to May 1983
were items available commercially, such as a Franco-German
dictionary of computer terms he bought in a book store and leaflets
on office equipment.
   He said he was paid about $2,550 for his services.
   Tscheu told the court he ended his contacts after a fourth
meeting in East Berlin. He was arrested by French secret agents a
few weeks later.
   Tscheu became involved with the German agents after placing an ad
in a West German newspaper offering to act as a commercial
representative in France. He said his own commercial ventures, such
as selling Greek carpets, had been unsuccessful and he was in need
of a job.
   When he first met the agents, identified as Michael Neubus and
Peter, they said he could represent them in France, selling
porcelain and shirts. However, Tscheu admitted in court that the men
appeared ``a little strange.''
   In three meetings in East Berlin, they asked him to supply
seemingly banal information such as details on modern office
equipment, a civil aviation map and a Franco-German technical
dictionary.
   Tscheu told the court the material he provided was all available
commercially.
   ``I was arrested,'' Tscheu said in testimony Thursday. ``But I'm
not a spy and I never was. I was afraid.''
   French agents were alerted by the husband of Ms. Drouillaut, who
was Tscheu's mistress. They began investigating Tscheu and arrested
him within weeks of his last trip to East Berlin.
   Ms. Drouillaut's husband, a navigating engineer at a flight test
center, became suspicious after she began asking him a series of
questions. The questions came after Tscheu's contacts requested
technical information on the aviation industry.
   The husband allegedly wrote an anonymous letter to the local
gendarmerie denouncing Tscheu as a spy.

   You say your sneer's a little crooked, your
pompadour's a little flat and _ gasp, what would the King think _
you've forgotten the words to ``Don't Be Cruel''?
   No problem.
   A weekend convention featuring an international lineup of Elvis
Presley impersonators _ about 80 altogether _ includes a seminar on
how to be a better Elvis.
   ``Sure, you have to look like Elvis, sound like Elvis and capture
all the little idiosyncracies,'' said Dave Carlson, who conducted a
seminar Friday. ``But I can't grab a person's leg and say, `Here,
move your leg like this.'''
   Carlson demonstrates, grabbing his own knee and moving it in a
circle that threatens to tear the joint from its socket.
   ``Something's got to be there,'' said Carlson, who's been doing
Elvis for 20 years. ``Most of it has to come from the individual.''
   And there's plenty of them to go around.
   This weekend in Rosemont, a west Chicago suburb, the EP
Impersonators International Association is holding its first annual
convention.
   Here, Elvis comes in all shapes and sizes.
   They come from the suburbs, England, Australia.
   In fact, 15 states and six countries are represented.
   There's even a woman.
   ``As far as I know, I'm the only one,'' said 26-year-old Janice
Waite of London. ``But when I'm on stage, I really don't think about
it.''
   Ms. Waite, a horse jockey off the stage, said her English accent
doesn't bother her, either. ``I sing in an American accent,'' she
said. ``I can't talk in it very well, but I can't sing any other
way.''
   Jerome Marion of Manteno, south of Chicago, wears a white
jumpsuit _ opened to the bottom of his ribcage _ blanketed with
sequins and eagle designs. ``The girls are the most exciting part,''
he said, while his wife, Brenda, smiled.
   ``I never introduce her as my wife. It would intimidate the
fans,'' Marion said.
   ``That was my idea,'' said Mrs. Marion, who helps Marion during
his act. ``I know how important this is to him. He gets the mirror
first in the bathroom, too.''
   Jumpsuits like Marions' replica of Presley's ``Aloha Hawaii''
outfit are for sale in the hotel lobby for $800 to $2,250. Custom
outfits start at $1,000.
   Carlson, meanwhile, an Illinois native, said he makes his living
impersonating the King of Rock 'n' Roll, playing two to three shows
a week at nightclubs, festivals and outdoor concerts.
   But, he insisted, ``I don't take it to bed with me.
   ``The biggest mistake a lot of impersonators make is they take it
off-stage with them. You have to know when to turn it off.''

<HEAD>Greyhound Union President Calls for Removal of Company Management</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound union president Edward M. Strait
called Friday for a bankruptcy judge to oust the company's
management and approve an employee take-over plan to save the
nation's only nationwide bus line.
   ``I think the only salvation right now is an employee stock
ownership plan and that's what we're pursuing,'' said Strait, who
represents Greyhound's 6,300 union drivers, who walked out March 2
in a wage and job security dispute.
   Strait, in his first detailed response to Greyhound's filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week, said in an
interview that the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions
wants to work with the bus line's creditors toward implementing an
employee stock ownership plan.
   Any such plan would first require a bankruptcy judge's removal of
current Greyhound chairman Fred Currey and the appointment of a
trustee, Strait said.
   Union drivers could then resume work under their old contract and
help the company become profitable again _ possibly with third-party
investors _ and pay off debts, Strait said. The union would
gradually gain an increased amount of control of the company's
operations, he said.
   The only other way to save the company, Strait said, is for
Greyhound to return to the bargaining table and seek a contract with
union drivers for an end to the three-month-old strike.
   ``Those are not the only two ways,'' countered Greyhound
spokesman George Gravley, noting the company filed Chapter 11 so it
could reorganize its finances and continue operating.
   The company was forced into bankruptcy, Gravley said, because of
strike violence that cost the company close to $50 million.
   There were dozens of shootings and bomb threats early in the
strike, as well as violence on the picket line. A striking driver
was crushed to death in Redding, Calif., by a bus driven by a
replacement driver.
   ``What we are faced with is this one-time charge that is directly
attributable to the violence of the strike that overwhelmed our
financial system when it occurred all at once,'' Gravley said.
   ``If this had been a lawful, peaceful strike, we would not be in
Chapter 11 right now,'' he claimed.
   Strait noted there have not been any acts of violence in more
than a month.
   ``The violence seemed to end when the company got rid of all
their Ninja security guards. They traveled in these black vans, they
had these uniforms tucked into boots. If that isn't planned to
initiate something, I don't know what is,'' Strait said.
   Instead, Strait claimed, the ``turning point'' that brought
Greyhound to bankruptcy was a National Labor Relations Board
complaint alleging that Greyhound's unfair labor practices caused
the walkout.
   The complaint, formally filed last week, was crucial because it
prompted concern among creditors since it opens Greyhound up to
possibly $10 million a month in back pay, Strait said.
   Gravley said Greyhound could easily continue operating once it
reorganizes its finances.
   ``There is a strong demand for our service,'' he said. ``This is
not a sunset business that is disappearing because no one wants to
buy from us.''

<HEAD>Nevada Judge Clears Way for Quadriplegic to End His Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge Friday cleared the way for a 31-year-old
quadriplegic to end his life after hearing the disabled man's ailing
father testify his son wants to die before him.
   State District Judge Donald Mosley granted a petition sought by
Kenneth A. Bergstedt that would allow a doctor to give Bergstedt a
sedative and disconnect him from the respirator that he needs to
help him breathe.
   ``He wants to go before I do,'' Bergstedt's 65-year-old father,
Robert, testified. ``There's no future for him. He knows he'll never
walk again. He knows he has to depend on someone else the rest of
his life.''
   But Mosley ordered the state attorney general's office to appeal
to the Nevada Supreme Court and cautioned the elder Bergstedt
against acting too hastily. ``This merely allows you the option,''
Mosley said.
   Mosley ordered an expedited appeal so the Supreme Court could set
a precedent. Nevada has no laws governing such cases.
   ``One district court judge's opinion does not put this to rest,''
Mosley said. ``For the residents of the state of Nevada, and for
Kenneth Bergstedt, a definitive resolution needs to be had.''
   The request for the order was not opposed by Deputy Attorney
General Donald Haight, who said he based his opinion on Bergstedt
having a constitutional right to privacy.
   Bergstedt, who did not attend the hearing, has been paralyzed
from age 10 since his neck was broken when a girl jumped into a pool
on him while he was swimming.
   The elder Bergstedt said his son has wanted to end his life for
17 years, ever since he came to the realization he had no hope of
recovering from injuries that shattered any chances of leading a
normal life.
   ``He sees all these things are denied him that a normal man would
do,'' he said. ``When he had it for three or four years he started
realizing there was no cure. He expressed then his desire to die.''
   Bergstedt said his son decided to seek a court order allowing him
to die after hearing of a similar case about 18 months ago in
California.
   He said his son, who spends most of his time on a gurney and
cannot feed himself or handle any of his bodily functions, sees no
reason to continue living.
   ``I'm not overjoyed with it,'' he said of his son's desire to
die. ``But I do consent with what he's doing. I can see why he's
doing it.''
   He has cared for his son on a 24-hour basis since his wife died
in November 1978, and he said his son fears being put in an
institution when he dies.
   The elder Bergstedt has one leg, suffers from high blood pressure
and said he recently had a spot discovered on a lung.
   ``It would probably be very difficult for him to adjust to a
bunch of different people caring for him,'' Bergstedt said.

   Perestroika has brought the Soviet Union baseball,
Big Macs and now a barbershop quartet; and that country's first such
troupe harmonized here Friday to American classics like
``Chattanooga Choo-Choo.''
   The Quiet Don Quartet, wearing Western European-styled suits,
pleased a small crowd at the Faneuil Hall Marketplace with familiar
melodies and lighthearted showmanship.
   ``It's not very known in Russia, but wherever we go people love
it,'' said Yuri Ivanovich Vasilief, the smiling tenor in the group,
through a translator.
   ``The people (in the Soviet Union) are usually very surprised,
and people from the audience like barbershop style,'' said the
group's bass, Oleg Nikolaevich Kovalenko. Evgeni Garreivich Feldman
is the group's lead vocalist and Sergei Alexandrovich Tarakanov
sings baritone.
   Vasilief, 55, said the quartet first heard barbershop singing _ a
popular American tradition of simple, easy-to-sing melodies in
four-part harmony _ at a music conference in East Germany in 1987.
The group was visiting with their chamber choir from the Soviet
Institute of Music in Rostov.
   Friday, the singers smiled and gestured with their hands as they
performed several songs including ``Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goodbye''
and ``Side By Side.''
   The quartet members spoke little or no English, but sang the
songs in English.
   ``It is not difficult to learn the songs, because they are very
interesting,'' Vasilief said.
   The quartet arrived from the Soviet Union a week ago to perform
with a barbershop group called the Big Apple Chorus in New York
City, said George O'Brien, a representative of the Southshore,
Mass., Men of Harmony, which brought the troupe to Boston.
   This was the first stop in a ten-city tour for Quiet Don Quartet,
whose name is taken from the ``lazy flowing Don River'' in the
Soviet Union, Vasilief said.
   ``I think this trip is one of many new bridges of communication
between the two countries,'' Vasilief said, noting Soviet Union
President Mikhail Gorbachev's restructuring plans and open-door
policy with the United States.
   Kovalenko said the group received several letters and finally an
invitation from a Los Angeles troupe, The 139th Street Quartet, to
visit the United States. The Los Angeles group asked them to travel
to San Francisco to compete in an international barbershop quartet
competition beginning July 3.
   Getting permission to make the trip wasn't a problem, but the
members couldn't afford airplane tickets, said Kovalenko, 27.
   The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop
Quartet Singing in America Inc. raised about $20,000 to bring the
quartet to America, O'Brien said.
   ``They are going back (to Russia) to form other barbershop choral
and quartet groups,'' O'Brien said. ``We're hoping that in a year or
so there will be freer visitation rights in Russia.''

   An international health organization Friday
began a 10-year program to help developing companies control
tropical diseases such as intestinal worms and malaria.
   International Medical Services for Health, based in Leesburg,
Va., is raising money from companies, individuals and foundations to
help Third World countries solve their health problems.
   ``We know we can affect the lives of 500 million people by the
year 2000,'' said Linda Pfeiffer, president of the nonprofit
international health organization.''
   More than 3 billion people _ half the world's population _ are
afflicted by intestinal worms, malaria and schistosomiasis, she said.
   ``We can't do it for the whole world by the year 2000 ... but for
this large part of the population we can contain it,'' she said in
an interview.
   Officials of the organization were holding a two-day conference
in Washington with representatives of nonprofit groups from 25
countries and public health experts to work on the project, called
the Millennium Program. The conference was sponsored by an
educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, one of
about 25 drug companies that contribute to the organization.
   The most widespread health problem in the tropical areas of Asia,
Africa and South America is intestinal worms, Pfeiffer said. Most of
the approximately 3 billion people afflicted with worms are
children, and about 1 million children a year die, she said.
   An estimated 100 million to 300 million new cases of malaria
occur each year; about 1 percent of them are fatal.
   Schistosomiasis, caused by an intestinal parasite, afflicts about
600 million people. The disease is less widespread than worms but is
more serious, she said.
   The organization has distributed about $50 million in medical
services since it was formed in 1986, she said. It also provides
technical, planning and training assistance to nonprofit groups in
developing countries.

   Burdened by four-digit annual
inflation and a debilitating recession, Argentines encountered
another setback Friday when their defending world champion soccer
team was upset by Cameroon in the World Cup.
   ``How sad the result,'' said a bank clerk who identified herself
only as Alejandra.
   Her normally crowded bank had emptied when the opening game of
the tournament began in Milan, Italy. Buenos Aires' afternoon
traffic slowed to a trickle, and many of Argentina's 32 million
inhabitants gathered in front of TV sets in homes and offices to
watch the game.
   Many fans blamed Argentine coach Carlos Bilardo, the team in
general and individual players for the 1-0 defeat, one of the
biggest upsets ever in world championship soccer.
   Cameroon was considered a 500-1 pick to win the tournament.
Argentina, which won the World Cup in 1978 and the last tournament
in 1986, has been expected to do well.
   ``Bad, very bad,'' said Obdulio Fernandez, a locker room
attendant at the Ferro Carril Oeste soccer club. ``We need some new
soccer players, that's all.''
   In Milan, Bilardo said the loss ``was the worst thing that has
happened to me'' since he took charge of the national team in 1983.
   President Carlos Menem, who watched the game at Milan's Meazza
stadium, said Cameroon ``deserved the victory.''
   Star player Diego Maradona, who did not get in a single shot
against Cameroon, said he believes Argentina can still win soccer's
top prize.
   ``We can't afford to lose again,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The staunchest public defender
of the Irish Republican Army said Friday the IRA killing of a
reserve police officer and his wife this week was wrong.
   ``You don't expect me to say that it was a good operation when it
patently was not,'' said Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing.
   Last week, Adams criticized the mistaken killing of two
Australian tourists in the Dutch town of Roermond on May 27 as
``inexcusable and unjustifiable.''
   However, Adams also told reporters in London earlier this week
that he regards the IRA as ``freedom fighters.'' On Friday he said
the killing of soldiers is justified.
   The IRA says it aims to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mostly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic republic of Ireland.
   Within two weeks, it has killed six people: attorneys Stephen
Melrose and Nicholas Spanos in Roermond; British army Pvt. William
Robert Davies, 19, on June 1 in Lichfield; British army Maj. Michael
John Dillon-Lee, 34, in Dortmund, West Germany; and retired reserve
officer James Sefton, 65, and Ellen Sefton, 66, in Belfast.
   The Seftons were killed Wednesday by a bomb planted in their car.
   ``What happened to those two old people was totally wrong,''
Adams said on Thursday. He reiterated that Friday, saying it was
``wrong _ that is my position.''
   Meeting with journalists Friday, Adams said it was not IRA policy
to attack retired police officers.
   Other recent IRA ``mistakes'' included the killing of Heidi
Hazell, 26-year-old German wife of a British soldier in September,
the slaying of the 6-month-old daughter of a British soldier in
Germany the following month, and the death of 16-year-old Terry
Love, killed by debris from an IRA bomb while watching a parade in
Londonderry in January.
   Some Sinn Fein activists have blamed such operations for the
decline in the party's vote in national elections from a high of
13.4 percent in 1983 to 11.4 percent in 1987.
   Adams was in London this week to promote his latest book, ``Cage
Eleven,'' about his experiences in prison. Questions, however,
inevitably focused on the killings in Roermond, Lichfield and
Dortmund.
   ``I have been very critical of the IRA. I have made my criticisms
known in a principled way where it matters, in republican circles as
well as the mass media,'' Adams said. ``There can be no doubt where
Sinn Fein stands on actions which lead to the deaths of civilians or
injuries to civilians.''
   But he did not criticize the killing of soldiers.
   ``I don't want to see anyone killed, much less a 19-year-old
soldier, an Australian citizen or an Irish citizens, but there is a
conflict,'' he said. ``There is a war going on. People join armies
to fight.''

   The Communist Party has expelled a former vice
minister of railways and eight other officials in his ministry for
accepting bribes, the official media reported Friday.
   It is the second major corruption case in the Railways Ministry
in nine months. Last October, the director of the ministry's
transportation department and three aides were accused of taking
bribes to allocate rail cars for transporting goods.
   Chinese leaders ordered a nationwide offensive against official
corruption last summer after crushing a pro-democracy movement that
won popular support by calling for cleaner government.
   In the latest case, Luo Yunguang, who had been vice minister of
the Railways Ministry since 1986, was ousted from his job in March
for accepting a gold ring, a refrigerator and $465 in bribes,
official reports said. He was also accused of embezzling $200.
   Reports on the case have not said what he did for the bribes.
   The party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on
Thursday circulated a notice expelling Luo and eight other ministry
officials involved in the case, the official Xinhua News Agency and
the nationally televised evening news said.
   Official reports in March said Luo had not been legally charged
yet and prosecutors were investigating the case.

<TEXT>
   New findings have thrown cold water on
``cold fusion'' experiments at several laboratories, but researchers
at the National Cold Fusion Institute here remain undeterred.
   Researchers at two Texas A&amp;M University labs and at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico have conceded that the
palladium rods used in their cold fusion experiments were
contaminated with tritium.
   Tritium is a byproduct of fusion, the bonding together of atomic
nuclei to create energy. The researchers now believe that what they
took to be evidence of fusion was actually contamination.
   Ronald Parker, director of the Plasma Fusion Center at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said skeptical scientists
long have speculated that contamination might be responsible for the
evidence of tritium in such experiments.
   ``The thing that does astonish me is that something this wasn't
detected earlier,'' he said. ``Tritium is the thing that would still
pique the interest of many scientists. Now that there seems to be a
logical explanation, maybe it is the last nail.''
   But a spokesman for the Utah institute said Friday that it used
palladium rods from a different source than the other labs, and they
are believed to have been uncontaminated.
   ``My impression is that people would be well-advised to analyze
thoroughly the palladium they've used in their experiments,''
Institute Director Fritz Will said.
   Nuclear fusion is usually accomplished at extremely high
temperatures, and is a costly process. Cold fusion would be highly
attractive because it would be a cheap and virtually inexhaustible
energy source.
   The cold fusion experiments were first reported by Utah
electrochemist B. Stanley Pons and British colleague Martin
Fleischmann. They involved a palladium electrode wrapped in platinum
wire, then immersed in deuterium oxide, also called heavy water.
   In a March 29, 1989, announcement that sparked a furor, Pons and
Fleischmann said that when they applied electricity to the
room-temperature device, more energy was released in the form of
heat than they put into it.
   The pair have said the cells also produced tritium, a product of
fusion, although they have not published any scientific reports
explaining their findings, nor have they or other researchers
pinpointed the reason for the excess heat.
   Will, who joined the state-funded institute in February, said he
could not speak for Pons and Fleischmann, who conduct separate
experiments in their chemistry department laboratories in addition
to those at the institute.
   Telephone messages to Pons went unanswered.
   But Will said that most, if not all, of the palladium rods used
at the institute were purchased from Johnson Mathey, a British
scientific supplier, and that specifications called for them to be
99.99 percent pure.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Kevin Wolf, a
physicist at Texas A&amp;M University's Cyclotron Laboratory, had
conceded that the palladium rods used in his experiments might have
been contaminated.
   Wolf said the rods were purchased from Hoover &amp; Strong, a metals
processor in Richmond, Va. An official there said the company
refines and processes palladium primarily for the jewelry trade, and
thus isn't as concerned about purity as scientists might be.
   Wolf was not immediately available for comment.
   Palladium from the same company was used in cold fusion
experiments at a chemistry lab at Texas A&amp;M and at Los Alamos.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Friday he
envisages a new relationship between the NATO and Warsaw Pact
alliances and the establishment of an all-European security body.
   But after more than four hours of talks with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Gorbachev said he remained opposed to a
united Germany as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We believe there is a chance for the formation of a new type of
relationship between the two alliances as they go through a
transforming process while overcoming military confrontation ... in
Europe,'' Gorbachev said.
   At a news conference with Mrs. Thatcher, Gorbachev added that if
the 16-nation NATO alliance agreed at a summit in London next month
to adopt a political role, ``an all-European system of security''
could follow.
   During the hour-long news conference, it was clear that Mrs.
Thatcher did not change Gorbachev's mind about the military future
of Germany, a key dispute unsolved at last week's superpower summit
in Washington.
   Gorbachev also suggested the Soviets want a matching response
from NATO to the decision by the seven-nation Warsaw Pact at a
summit here on Thursday to become a purely political and
``consultative'' organization by November.
   The Warsaw Pact is, however, regarded as a dying military
alliance incapable of mounting any joint offensive operation because
of the fall of communist governments in six of the member states.
   ``I think that what happened yesterday testifies about deep
changes in the essence of the (Warsaw Pact) organization,'' said
Gorbachev.
   ``If the processes go in such a direction at the NATO meeting in
July ... (this) will open the possibility for some agreement in
favor of an all-European system of security,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher disagreed, saying, ``For the time being we should
continue to work through the existing organizations.''
   But she also said that ``No country is more entitled to
assurance, and reassurance, about the future of Germany than the
Soviet Union.''
   The prospect of a united Germany has revived memories in the
Soviet Union of the devastating German invasion during World War II
that left millions dead.
   At the news conference, Gorbachev said the NATO and Warsaw Pact
military alliances cannot ignore the political cooperation that has
developed between East and Western Europe in recent years.
   ``One can have a policy that will resemble an elephant in a china
store: one move to the left smashes half of the store. A move to the
right smashes the other half,'' he said. ``If this is the policy we
choose, I don't envy us.''
   He said he was ``sure'' a solution would be found to the German
issue.
   In the talks, Mrs. Thatcher and Gorbachev discussed, among other
things, a nine-point U.S. plan aimed at overcoming Soviet concerns
about Germany in NATO. It includes proposals for keeping Soivet
troops in what is now East Germany during a transitional period.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who is on a four-day visit to the Soviet Union,
was to leave Moscow on Saturday to tour a British exhibition in the
Ukrainian capital, Kiev. On Sunday she goes to Armenia's second
city, Leninakan, hit by an earthquake 18 months ago.

   Hot, humid air covered most of the nation Friday, as severe
thunderstorms hit the central Plains, middle Mississippi Valley and
much of the East.
   Temperatures reached the 80s and the 90s across much of the
nation and climbed in the 100s in the desert Southwest and near the
Rio Grande in Texas. Cooler temperatures, 60s and 70s, stretched
over much of the northern tier, from the Pacific Northwest to New
England.
   Golfball-size hail fell in Omaha, Neb., and thunderstorms over
Western Kansas dropped dime-size hail in Goodland. Golfball-sized
hail and four inches of rain fell in Excelsior Springs in northwest
Missouri. In southwest Kansas, 1.70 inches of rain fell in Kearney.
   A warm front stretched from the Chesapeake Bay to southern
Michigan, producing showers over much of the region. A strong
thunderstorm produced dime-size hail in southern central Virginia.
   Showers and thunderstorms were reported in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
In central Indiana, 3.75 inches of rain deluged Sheridan in just
over a two-hour period, and 2.80 inches of rain fell in about two
and a half hours at Alexandria.
   Gunnison, Colo. and Butte, Mont., tied for the nation's low
temperature Friday at 33 degrees.
   On Saturday, rain is expected in the Northeast and much of the
West while sunny skies are predicted for the central part of the
nation. Temperatures are expected to again reach the 100s in the
Southwest.

   Supporters of a Spanish terrorist group on
Friday seized the Spanish Embassy in East Germany, forcing the

   However, the 12 East German leftists surrendered to police about
two hours later, the government news agency ADN said.
   The Spanish Foreign Ministry said Ambassador Alfonso Alvarez de
Toledo and his staff were forced out of the East Berlin embassy
during the takeover. No injuries were reported.
   Embassy attache Luis Fernandez said the youths were East Germans
who declared solidarity with a Spanish leftist terrorist group known
as GRAPO. The group is seeking to have its jailed members housed in
the same prison.
   The organization has claimed responsibility for 30 killings since
it was founded in 1975. Eighty-one of the members are in prison, and
the government has sent members to many different prisons.
   Most of the 81 inmates have staged hunger strikes to protest the
prisoner dispersal policy, and 40 are still on strike. One GRAPO
member died of a heart attack May 26 after 177 days without food.

<HEAD>KLM To Ground Pregnant Stewardesses Because Of Radiation Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national airline KLM will begin
grounding pregnant stewardesses this fall because of a U.S. report
saying crews may be exposed to harmful levels of radiation, a
company spokesman said Friday.
   The study by the U.S. Transportation Department, released in
February, estimates the lifetime cancer risk due to cosmic radiation
for airline crew members who fly 960 hours annually would be from
five to 61 deaths for every 100,000 individuals in 20 years of
flying.
   It also notes some risk to frequent fliers and to the fetuses of
pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy.
    ``We were planning on making some changes anyway, but the
reports of possible dangers related to higher radiation levels made
us act faster,'' KLM spokesman Hugo Baas said.
   Scientists and U.S. officials caution that the risk data was not
based on any study of actual cancer cases but on mathematical models
projecting the effects of low-level radiation from the sun and stars.
   Folkert Draaisma, a radio-biology expert at the National
Scientific Research center in Rijswijk, said radiation is most
dangerous between the 8th and 15th weeks of pregnancy, when fetal
brains are formed.
   ``I estimate that a stewardess who flies during her entire
pregnancy will reach the unacceptable level,'' which he indicated
was 40 percent above the normal dose of cosmic radiation that
everyone routinely receives.
   According to the new airline regulation, once a stewardess
reports her pregnancy, she must be given the option of an
alternative job on the ground or an extended paid pregnancy leave,
union leader Joop Kostermans said.
   Kosterman heads the Dutch Association of Cabin Personnel, which
represents 98 percent of KLM's 4,100 flight attendants.

   In a move reminiscent of the Baltic republics'
first steps toward secession, lawmakers of the vast Russian
Federation approved a draft proclamation that would give their laws
priority over national legislation.
   The Russian Congress, led by radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin,
approved the article in a draft ``Declaration of Sovereignty'' by a
544-271 vote, the Tass news agency reported. The final version of
the document must still be voted on.
   Most laws on the books in the 15 Soviet republics mirror national
laws, but sovereignty allows the republics to push ahead with
legislation that might contradict Kremlin wishes. The Russian
Federation is the largest and most populous of the Soviet republics.
   The Russian Federation, with its capital in Moscow, comprises
two-thirds of the country's territory and contains more than half
its population.
   The vote appeared to set the stage for a confrontation between
Yeltsin and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has warned
that the Kremlin cannot carry out its reforms if the Russian
heartland is not firmly behind it.
   Gorbachev strongly opposed Yeltsin's election last month as
president of the Russian Federation, saying his plans could lead to
the breakup of the country. But he expressed no concern about
Friday's measure.
   ``The Russian Congress has not passed anything that would
contradict the Soviet Constitution,'' he told a news conference
after he met with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who
was visiting Moscow.
   ``And I'm sure _ if you ask what percent, 100 percent sure _ that
neither the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia nor the future
Supreme Soviet will pass laws that would damage the development of
the federation or complicate its reformation,'' he said.
   ``The Russian people will not stand for being pushed to pit
themselves against other people, for breaking up the union,'' he
added.
   The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia began their
drive for independence by proclaiming the priority of their laws
over national laws. The Kremlin rejected their declarations of
sovereignty, and it has imposed a partial economic blockade against
Lithuania.
   Gorbachev indicated Friday he would seek a reconciliation with
Yeltsin even if he continues his strong push for Russian sovereignty.
   ``What would disturb me more than anything at this stage is a
split in the democratic forces,'' he said, implying that he viewed
Yeltsin as an ally in the reform movement.
   Yeltsin, who has become Gorbachev's political nemesis over the
last two years, has said he hopes to cooperate with Gorbachev
despite their personal and political differences, but that his first
priority is defending Russia's interests.
   He met recently with Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
and promised to set up strong ties with the breakaway republic as
soon as Russia gained sovereignty.
   The pledge implied he would be willing to circumvent the
Kremlin's blockade against Lithuania, which was imposed to pressure
the republic into suspending its March 11 declaration of indpendence.
   The Russian Congress, which convened for the first time in late
May, discussed the idea of sovereignty for hours, and virtually all
deputies supported it as a means of gaining more independence from
centrally dictated decisions.
   However, there were widely varying opinions on how far
sovereignty should go.
   The measure passed Friday instructed the editorial commission
working out Russia's declaration of sovereignty to base its work on
the idea that Russian laws supercede national ones.
   ``The legal sense of this is that Russian laws have a certain
priority over Soviet laws,'' said Sergei Gribanov of the Congress'
press center. ``But I wouldn't say this should be taken as a
secessionist declaration.''
   A final draft of the declaration likely will not be ready before
Wednesday, he said. Press center officials said they believed the
draft would require a two-thirds majority in the 1,060-member
Russian Congress.
   The brief Tass report from the Congress said the declaration
proclaims ``the priority of the Constitution of the Russian
Federation and laws of the Russian Federation on the entire
territory'' of the republic. It would suspend any laws of the Soviet
Union that contradict the republic's laws.

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Army sergeant with a brilliant
``criminal mind'' has admitted selling secret NATO plans for the
nuclear defense of Europe that were passed to the Soviet Union, an
FBI agent testified Friday.
   ``It's one of the most serious breaches ever _ it's unprecedented
what went over to the other side,'' said Joe Navarro, who led the
FBI's investigation. ``The ability to defend ourselves is
neutralized because they have all our plans.''
   Roderick James Ramsay, 28, made his initial court appearance
Friday on the charge of conspiracy to gather or deliver defense
information to aid a foreign government. U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth
Jenkins ordered him held until a bond hearing Tuesday.
   Ramsay's attorney, Mark Pizzo, did not enter any plea on his
client's behalf. Ramsay faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment
if convicted of espionage conspiracy.
   Ramsay was arrested Thursday night on a downtown street following
a two-year investigation.
   The FBI said Ramsay worked in West Germany from 1983 to 1985
directly under Clyde Lee Conrad, 43, a retired U.S. Army sergeant
convicted of treason by a West German court and given a life
sentence earlier this week.
   When the FBI began collecting information on Conrad in mid-1988,
agents conducted the first of some 40 interviews with the
cooperative Ramsay, authorities said.
   ``Ramsay has acknowledged that he was in fact recruited by Conrad
in mid-to-late 1983 and participated in espionage activity with
him,'' Navarro testified.
   Ramsay had a high IQ, speaks fluent Japanese, Spanish and German,
and has the ability to recall minute details, facts and figures from
hundreds of volumes of documents, Navarro testified.
   Those included sensitive documents on the use of tactical nuclear
weapons by U.S. forces and NATO allies, and plans for the defense of
Central Europe, the Justice Department said. Ramsay also leaked
technical manuals on military communications technology and material
about the coordination of NATO forces.
   ``He had the unique privilege of being posted where a lot of
highly sensitive information came through his hands,'' Navarro said.
He mentioned other examples such as the sites of nuclear storage
areas and contingency plans in the event of a nuclear attack by the
Soviet bloc or a Third World nation.
   The material was passed to Hungarian and Czechoslovakian agents
and eventually fell into the hands of the Soviet KGB, according to
FBI and Justice Department officials.
   ``It involves an extensive amount of information provided to the
Soviet intelligence service through Eastern European surrogates,''
said Justice spokesman Doug Tillett in Washington.
   Navarro testified that Ramsay began by photographing documents
and later discovered he could record more information with a video
recorder. In December 1985, the agent said, Ramsay spent a week
recording some 45 hours of documents he had either stolen or copied.
   Although Ramsay told the FBI he received only $20,000 for his
efforts, Navarro estimated the East bloc agents paid between $2.2
million and $5 million for the information from the ring.
   Authorities believe some of the money is stashed in foreign bank
accounts, said law enforcement sources speaking on condition of
anonymity. Investigators are trying to trace the money.
   Conrad controlled the money and Ramsay wanted very much to obtain
it, especially since recent financial problems forced him to live at
his mother's home in Tampa or sleep in his car, Navarro said.
   FBI agents would not discuss why they investigated Ramsay and
kept him under surveillance for two years before making an arrest,
but Navarro said agents hoped his cooperation would lead to other
suspects.
   Ramsay's last known contact with Conrad came in January 1986 in
Boston, when his former boss gave him a small cow bell and told him
that anyone displaying a similar bell was involved in the spy ring,
the agent testified.
   While the FBI has no evidence that Ramsay participated in
espionage since 1986, his vast knowlege of NATO secrets made him a
``highly marketable commodity'' to hostile governments, Navarro said.
   During the investigation, agents learned Ramsay had stashed top
secret documents at his mother's house and later destroyed them,
Navarro said. The agent added that Ramsay still claims to have a
tape with highly sensitive defense information.
   Agents searched the home and Ramsay's car following his arrest,
but have not revealed what was found.
   The FBI agent described the mustachioed, bespectacled suspect as
having a ``criminal mind'' and no remorse for his actions.
   Before joining the Army, Ramsay is believed to have participated
in a 1981 bank robbery in Vermont and then fled to Hawaii, Navarro
said.
   He added that Ramsay said he tried ``every drug under the sun''
and in fact was forced out of the Army in 1985 after traces of
hashish showed up in a urine test.
   Ramsay was a man who had no fear of going to jail, telling FBI
agents as recently as a month ago he would be able to read, get a
law degree and obtain a criminal education, Navarro said.
   ```Look out when I get out,''' Navarro quoted Ramsay as saying,
```because I'm going to be an educated criminal.'''

   South African singer Miriam
Makeba, whose music was banned on government-run radio and
television for 12 of her 30 years in exile, is to return home Sunday
for a brief visit.
   Ms. Makeba, who has frequently spoken out against racial
discrimination in South Africa, is best known for songs that rely
heavily on traditional African rhythms.
   She spoke out against apartheid at the United Nations in 1976 and
as a result, South Africa's government-run radio and television
refused to broadcast her songs until last year.
   In 1987 she performed with singer Paul Simon on his ``Graceland''
tour.
   Ms. Makeba, 58, left South Africa in 1960 after touring abroad.
She has lived in the United States, Guinea, Belgium and is now a
resident of France.
   A spokesman for the South African Musicians' Alliance confirmed
the visit by Ms. Makeba, and said she would not be performing. Ms.
Makeba plans to see family and friends and visit the grave of her
mother who died when she was in exile.
   Ms. Makeba has been married five times, including a marriage to
political activist Stokely Carmichael.

   A principal has asked for dismissal of
criminal charges against students who threw paper airplanes during a
graduation ceremony.
   ``This thing is settled and we want it to end. It has hurt the
community and the school,'' Live Oak High School principal Owen
Norgress said Thursday.
   Everyone involved in the May 25 graduation flight has apologized
and none will be prosecuted, he said.
   Jared S. Vicknair and David D. Wallace, both graduating seniors,
had to post $500 property bond each last week after Norgress filed a
criminal mischief complaint against them.
   Vicknair's attorney, Eric Pittman Jr., said more than 20 other
seniors also threw paper airplanes at the faculty.
   The sheriff's office had said earlier that at least three other
seniors were involved and would be arrested when they returned from
senior trips.
   ``I will ask the sheriff's department to drop all charges against
the persons involved,'' said Norgress.

   ``Wildman'' Steve Brill helped Wisconsin nature
lovers munch their way through Central Park on Friday, warning the
group they were breaking the law with each leaf picked.
   ``Three whistles is an SOS or ranger alert,'' he said at the
outset of the tour, his first in the park since he quit his Parks
Department job last month in a dispute with the new commissioner.
   Parks spokesman Skip Garrett said the department would not take
any action against Brill unless he engaged in ``wanton destruction
of the flora.''
   Since 1981, Brill has led an estimated 15,000 people on
walking-dining tours of city parks, encouraging people to sample the
edible flora growing wild.
   Parks officials had him arrested in 1986, but reached an
agreement for him to continue the tours as a city employee.
   But new Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum complained Brill didn't want
to punch a time clock or report to an office, and that he was
encouraging people to take things out of the park. She also said it
could be unhealthy to eat things picked from the parks, given the
number of dogs who relieve themselves there.
   Brill quit on May 29 rather than accept the new rules, he said.
   The group from the Riveredge Nature Center in Newburg, Wis., had
arranged their tour with Brill last year and decided to stick with
the plan despite his changed status.
   ``I think it's absurd, but then I've only heard his side of the
story,'' said Pat Sherman-Cisler of Milwaukee, one of about 50
tourists.

   Julie Glover, director of Bossier Animal Control, said skunks are

Northwest Louisiana between May 15 and June 1. The area has been
beset by heavy rains.
   ``It wouldn't be impossible to have a large rabies epidemic,''
Glover said. The disease could easily spread to the many

   A letter from Gen. George S. Patton Jr.
describing how he motivated a fearful platoon in combat has been
sold for $17,600.
   Patton sent the signed letter in 1944 to Gen. Charles Summerall,
a former Army chief of staff who was one of his teachers at West
Point. In it, Patton described how he ordered a retreating platoon
to attack.
   ``The interesting thing was that the simple statement on my part
that they would attack removed the nervous tension,'' he wrote. ``It
is really amazing what the determination on the part of one man can
do to many thousands.''
   The letter was sold Thursday by Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions
to an anonymous private New Jersey collector. The letter was one of
seven Patton letters sold at the auction for a total of $50,325.
   One unsold item was a handwritten 1967 letter in which Ronald
Reagan admonished his daughter Patti, then 14, for using
``deception'' to hide her smoking. Bidding reached $19,000 but the
seller demanded a $20,000 minimum.
   Also Thursday, an 1847 letter from Charlotte Bronte to the
publisher of her novel ``Jane Eyre'' sold at Christie's auction
house in Manhattan for $52,800. It was signed with the Victorian
author's pen name, Currer Bell.

   The foreign ministers of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia said Friday they made a joint request to attend a
35-nation meeting on human rights.
   The three Baltic states of the Soviet Union applied for separate
observer status in a letter to Executive Secretary Ulrik Haxthausen
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Lennart
Meri of Estonia said.
   Meri told reporters they received no reply. He was joined by
Janis Jurkins of Latvia and Algirdas Saudargas of Lithuania.
   At the opening of the conference meeting Tuesday, a separate
Lithuanian request for observer status was rejected. The Danish
foreign minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, said admission of Lithuania
was impossible because the Soviet Union would object.
   Lithuania on March 11 declared its independence from the Soviet
Union, but Moscow has refused to recognize the declaration and
imposed an economic blockade on the republic. The two other Baltic
states are also seeking independence from Moscow, which took over
the three republics in 1940 under terms of a Nazi-Soviet pact.
   Albania, the last hard-line Communist state in Eastern Europe,
was allowed to attend the conference meeting in Copenhagen as an
observer. Albania is the only European country that has not signed
the 1975 Helsinki agreements on security and human rights that
resulted in the 35-nation group.

   The body of a Palestinian man who allegedly
admitted to collaborating with Israel's Shin Bet internal security
service was found Friday in a field in the occupied West Bank, Arab
reports said.
   The victim, Ismat Yousef Al-Salem, 27, had been taken from his
home two weeks earlier by masked Palestinians, the reports said. He
had been stabbed repeatedly.
   The body of Al-Salem was found outside the village of Kufr Zibad
near the West Bank's largest city, Nablus.
   Arab reports said after his abduction Al-Salem announced through
a loudspeaker from the village mosque that he had worked with the
Shin Bet since 1982. They said a leaflet distributed in the village
accused him of collaboration.
   The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating.
   Al-Salem's death raised to at least 219 the number of
Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs since the Palestinian revolt
against Israeli occupation began in December 1987. Most were accused
of collaboration with Israel.
   A total of 716 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians, and 45 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Also Friday, the army demolished the top two floors of a house
owned by Mohammed Hassan Baker, 55, in Gaza City.
   Arab reports said Baker's son, Mazen, 27, is wanted by Israel on
charges he was a member of a Palestinian enforcement group that
killed suspected collaborators.
   The two floors contained five rooms that were home to 21 people.

   A federal judge issued a temporary restraining
order Friday forcing striking railroad workers in Maryland and five
other states to dismantle their pickets and go back to work.
   ``We are in the process of notifying our people to remove their
picket signs. I know they will,'' said George Laitila, a regional
representative for the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, which organized the strike over the indefinite layoff of 11
crane operators in Cumberland.
   Laitila said thousands of union workers honored picket lines at
six locations in Baltimore, Cumberland, Jessup and Brunswick in
Maryland; Grafton and Fairmont, W.Va.; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia,
Pa.; Wilmington, Del.; Garrett and Washington, Ind.; and Cincinnati
and Willard, Ohio.
   U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove issued the 10-day
restraining order to end the strike, which forced 7,400 riders on
two Maryland commuter lines to find other ways to their jobs in
Washington, D.C.
   ``In effect, he called the strike off,'' said Lloyd D. Lewis, a
CSX spokesman in Jacksonville, Fla. ``The determination was that
this was a minor dispute that did not allow the union to strike.''
   Laitila disagreed.
   ``We're not going to defy a federal judge,'' he said. ``The next
step will be a hearing in federal court where we will have an
opportunity to present our case to a federal judge.''
   The IBEW contended that CSX violated an agreement with the
electrical workers when it announced a furlough last week of 45
employees at a train yard in Cumberland. The indefinite layoff
included 11 crane operators.
   ``The company took illegal action that affected 11 people
directly,'' Laitila said. ``I called out 375 electrical workers I
represent. In support of their fellow unionists, the other railroad
labor unions honored our picket lines to an incredible degree.''
   CSX spokesman said it was impossible to know how many people
honored the union's picket lines.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of pushing his wife and her
friend off a cliff was acquitted of murder Friday, a year after
another jury deadlocked in the same case.
   James Gibbs had insisted that Helen Gibbs and Susan White Haire
fell to their deaths accidentally while he was taking their picture
at a scenic overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. He said the two
women were sitting on a stone ledge, and one grabbed the other's arm
as she fell.
   He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the
deaths on Oct. 17, 1988.
   ``He might have been guilty, but the state couldn't prove it,''
said jury forman Norman Arrowood, adding that the jury split 11-1
during morning deliberations.
   The jury took about three hours to return its verdict.
   A mistrial was declared last June when another jury deadlocked at
10-2 votes for conviction.
   Gibbs, 38, left the courtroom a few minutes after the verdict and
was mobbed by reporters. Family members of Mrs. Gibbs cried and left
quickly.
   ``Well, my feet hurt, I've been walking on them,'' Gibbs said in
reference to pacing in his cell.
   During four weeks of testimony, prosecutors contended that Gibbs
had a history of physically abusing his wife and that he was angered
by her plans to leave him and get a divorce.
   Defense Attorney Charles Burgin told the McDowell County jury
Thursday the state failed to prove several key elements in the case,
including a motive.
   Gibbs had been in jail for close to two years since his 1988
arrest.

   Los Alamos National Laboratory is trying
to determine how one of its employees was exposed to radioactive
tritium, a lab spokesman said Friday.
   The employee, whose name was withheld, worked in an area where
experiments are conducted on materials that may be used in nuclear
weapons, said lab spokesman John Webster.
   Tritium is a man-made radioactive isotope of hydrogen.
   The exposure dose cannot be definitely determined until the time
of exposure is known, but the dose hypothetically could be as much
as 3.2 rem, the lab said.
   A rem is the unit of measurement used to describe the biological
effect of radiation exposure. Natural background radiation exposes a
person to 0.1-0.3 rems a year; a routine chest X-ray, 0.6 rems.
   The maxium exposure allowed for federal workers is 5 rem a year.
   The employee's exposure was detected this week during a routine
urinalysis, Webster said.

<HEAD>Survey Says TV Marti Being Seen Despite Jamming</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent survey has concluded that the
U.S.-government sponsored television station sending test broadcast
which broadcasts to Cuba is reaching ``at least occasionally'' about
28 per cent of the households in western Cuba, officials said Friday.
   Tony Navarro, who directs the TV Marti operation, said the survey
repudiates Cuban claims that extensive jamming has been virtually
100 per cent successful in keeping the station's news and
entertainment shows from reaching Cuban households.
   TV Marti has been testing since March 27. Sometime this summer,
President Bush is expected to make a determination as to whether the
broadcasts should become permanent.
   The survey was taken of 543 Cubans who have arrived in the United
States since testing began. Navarro said in an interview that the
results clearly indicate that TV Marti is a worthwhile project that
should be continued despite the jamming effort.
   The sampling, which was performed by a New York firm, was limited
to Cubans who live in the ``primary target area'' of TV Marti _ the
city of Havana and three western provinces.
   ``Twenty-eight per cent of the households in the primary target
area appear to be able to receive TV Marti at least occasionally,''
Navarro said.
   He said the word ``occasionally'' means anywhere from five
minutes to three hours at least twice a week.
   He said the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses was
reinforced by the fact that 57 per cent were able to recall and
identify specific programs.
   President Fidel Castro has called TV Marti a ``gross instrument
of subversion'' and made arrangements to block the signal from the
first day that programming began. He also has said the operation
violates international law.
   In addition to jamming TV Marti, Cuban authorities also have
begun blocking the signal in the Havana area of Radio Marti, a Voice
of America station that began broadcasting five years ago.
   TV Marti has limited testing to the pre-dawn hours in order not
to interfere with regular programming by Cuban stations. Its
supporters maintain that TV Marti helps break the monopoly over news
that the Cuban government has had for 31 years and also provides the
Cuban people with more varied entertainment.

<HEAD>Agent's Suit Challenges Anti-Homosexual Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran FBI agent sued the agency Friday,
contending it irrationally bans homosexuals from employment, and
plans to fire him because he disclosed in 1988 that he is a
homosexual.
   The agent is identified as John Doe in the U.S. District Court
suit _ not because he is embarrassed by his openly declared sexual
orientation, but because he has done sensitive counterintelligence
work for the FBI and wants to resume if he wins the suit, his lawyer
said.
   ``The FBI has a policy and practice of denying security
clearances and employment to gay persons only because of their
sexual orientation, association with other gay people, and
speculation about their sexual conduct,'' the suit said.
   It said the policy was based on sexual orientation, not conduct,
and that no such policy covered heterosexual conduct such as
extra-marital affairs.
   The policy is irrational as applied to Doe, who has an excellent
work record, has received several special commendations, and isn't
susceptible to blackmail, the suit said. Doe is based in San Diego.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez denied that such a
policy exists.
   ``Our concern is with sexual conduct, not preference,'' he said.
``You may have even heterosexual conduct with which we may be
concerned if it affects the job.''
   Stressing that he was not discussing any specific case, Fernandez
said the FBI's policy is that ``homosexual conduct is considered a
significant factor'' in employee hiring and retention ``on a
case-by-case basis.''
   He declined to say whether homosexual conduct is a bar to FBI
employment or how it is evaluated.
   But Doe's lawyer, Richard Gayer, said the FBI's absolute ban on
homosexual employees was declared publicly in response to a 1979
lawsuit that challenged the policy.
   Gayer said the FBI policy has been upheld in two other appellate
circuits.
   ``The issue in this case is whether they can simply ignore 20
years of good service,'' Gayer said.
   Doe ``does not care who knows he is gay'' but never told the FBI
until an investigation that started in December 1988, the suit said.

   The 400-foot ship Mayajima Maru was boarded 11 miles offshore,

   The case is to be investigated by the National Fisheries Bureau

   Just when it seemed Sam Nunn would go unopposed in
his bid for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate, state election
officials said Friday they have reinstated a woman as a Republican
candidate for the job.
   Mrs. Hubert Etchison Sr., who refuses to give her first name, has
informed the state she wants to rescind a May 31 letter in which she
withdrew from the July 17 GOP primary, said Bill Crane, a spokesman
for the secretary of state's office.
   Republican and election officials said they were studying the
legal questions involved, but she is back on the ballot for now.
   Mrs. Etchison was the only candidate to qualify this spring to
run against Nunn, the veteran Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed
Services Committee. She used a check to pay her qualifying fee of
$2,952 to the Republican Party in April, but the check bounced.
   Bill Thorne, the party's executive director, said GOP officials
then gave her a May 25 deadline to pay the qualifying fee in cash.
She was given an extension to May 31 on the condition that she
pre-sign a letter of withdrawal and authorize party officials to
submit it to the state if she failed to meet the final deadline.
   Thorne delivered the letter to the secretary of state's office
last week.
   Crane said Mrs. Etchison called the secretary of state's office
this week to rescind her withdrawal, saying Republican Party
officials weren't supposed to act on her letter so quickly.
   She also delivered a cashier's check for the amount of the
qualifying fee to GOP officials.
   Jeff Lanier, director of the elections division in the secretary
of state's office, said Mrs. Etchison is back on the ballot for now.
   But he added that there is a question of whether a person can be
listed on the ballot if he or she didn't pay the qualifying fee on
time, and he has asked for advice from the state law department.

   Former President Jose Figueres, who
guided Costa Rica through a revolution to democracy and then
abolished the country's army, died Friday. He was 83.
   He was widely credited with starting this Central American nation
of 2.8 million people on the road to 42 years of peace and relative
prosperity in a region not known for stability or economic success.
   Figueres died at his home outside San Jose, presidential
spokeswoman Ana Lorena Vargas said. The medical report said he died
of natural causes, a family spokesman said. He had been in poor
health in recent years.
   His body will remain at his home Friday night and lie in state at
the National Museum beginning Saturday morning, a statement from the
family said.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday at the National
Cathedral with burial at his ranch in San Marcos de Tarrazu, 50
miles from San Jose.
   President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia called a three-day
mourning period. He described Figueres as ``one of the most valient
men our country had who contributed enormously to the development of
democracy in Costa Rica. He is one of the protagonists of our
history and one of those who contributed most to peace.''
   The charismatic and combative Figueres, known affectionately as
Don Pepe, took to the hills in 1948 to lead a brief but bloody
revolt against the late President Rafael Angel Calderon, father of
the present chief of state.
   The elder Calderon was a strongman who allied himself with the
Communists and was trying to return to power by canceling the
presidential election of Otilio Ulate.
   During an 18-month interim presidency, Figueres abolished the
army in 1949 and restored honest elections. The new constitution
written by his government also increased social services.
   The Communist Party was banned, but has since been legalized.
   Figueres later was elected to two terms, serving from 1953-58 and
1970-74.
   A civil and rural guard continues to be Costa Rica's only defense
in a region wracked by wars. The country invested in education
instead, and has a literacy level of about 90 percent, one of the
highest in the hemisphere.
   Born Sept. 25, 1906, soon after his parents arrived in Costa Rica
from Spain, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and studied hydroelectric engineering.
   He established a ranch in Costa Rica where he carried out
innovative agricultural and forestry projects.
   Even as president, the 5-foot-3-inch Figueres traveled without
bodyguards, although he often carried a pistol.
   A fierce anti-Communist, he came to sympathize with the left. He
visited Cuba numerous times, allowed establishment of a Soviet
Embassy over widespread objections, and backed the leftist
Sandinista revolution in neighboring Nicaragua that overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   He boasted of having worked closely with the CIA in his earlier
days, but railed against U.S. policy when the United States
supported Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas.
   ``Times change and only the rivers don't return,'' he once
retorted to critics of contradictions in his politics.
   He went against public opinion and granted fugitive American
financier Robert Vesco refuge here in 1972. Vesco was expelled in
1978.
   During the 1971 hijacking of a Costa Rican airliner, Figueres
took matters into his own hands.
   Figueres grabbed a submachine gun and took off for San Jose
airport after being told that the three Nicaraguans demanding to go
to Cuba were refusing to cooperate in efforts to free the passengers.
   ``I'll end all this,'' he said as he moved toward the plane.
Shots came from the plane, and police fired machine guns. The
incident concluded with two hijackers wounded and the passengers
leaving the plane unharmed.
   In his later years before his health failed, he traveled the
world on behalf of Costa Rica and to many was the personification of
his country.
   Costa Rica is one of the few countries in the region with a
substantial middle class. Much of this is due to Costa Rica's
possessing little mineral wealth. It was not settled by Spaniards
seeking gold or silver but by European farmers who tended to work
their own land.
   However, much of the country's prosperity was achieved on credit,
and Costa Rica spends a high percentage of its export earnings
paying off the debt. This has led to unpopular austerity measures in
recent years.
   Figueres married Henrietta Boggs of Alabama in 1942. They had two
children, Muni and Jose Marti, before the marriage ended in divorce
in 1952.
   He later married Karen Olsen, a naturalized American citizen of
Danish birth. They had three children, Jose Maria, Mariano and
Cristiana. His wife now is a member of the National Assembly, the
country's congress.
   He also is survived by 17 grandchildren.

   The Security Council on Friday extended the
mandate of the U.N. Observer Group in Central America for 19 days to
complete the lagging demobilization of Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas.
   Disbanding of more than 13,000 rebel fighters and support
personnel was to have been completed by June 10, but only about half
have been disarmed.
   The observer group has 995 military personnel in six border
zones, but it ran into trouble when some Contra leaders insisted on
parallel dismantling of some forces of the former Sandinista army
under the new U.S.-backed government.
   The council's unanimous decision Friday forestalled a
confrontation between the United States, which has backed the
Contras, and Cuba, which supported the former Sandinista government
and blames Washington for tension in the region.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the council it
appears impossible to complete the process of demobilization by
Sunday, June 10, but rapid progress has been made in the past week
in some areas.

   Sheriff's deputies burst into a
record shop Friday moments after an undercover detective bought 2
Live Crew recordings to make the first arrest since a federal judge
declared the rap group's album obscene.
   E-C Records owner Charles Freeman had defiantly ordered a
shipment of 25 copies of ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' and was doing
a brisk business when an undercover officer bought the double-album
and a cassette for $8.49 each.
   Before the detective reached the door, six deputies rushed in,
handcuffing Freeman and arresting him on misdemeanor charges of
distributing obscene material. If convicted, he could be sentenced
to a year in jail and fined $1,000.
   ``America is free, free for everybody,'' Freeman said before
authorities took him to the Broward County Jail, where he was booked
and posted $100 bond. ``And as long as this is America and I'm not
living in Cuba, I feel my rights are violated.''
   The arrest came two days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez
found that the sexually explicit recording was without social value,
appealed only to prurient interests and violated community standards
in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
   Lyrics of many of the songs on the album contain references to
violence against women and abusive sex, though they're tempered with
humor.
   ``The inevitable has finally occurred,'' said Robyn E. Blumner,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida.
``Someone in Broward is facing jail time because he sold a record
album to an adult. That action put south Florida about on a par with
Eastern Europe _ a year ago.''
   She said the ACLU will offer legal representation to Freeman.
   At a news conference later in Miami, Luther Campbell, owner and
president of 2 Live Crew's record label, said the company will help
pay the legal fees of retailers arrested for selling the album.
   ``Somebody has to stand up and the retailers, I think, should
stand up,'' Campbell said. ``We can give them some of the contacts
we used in our case and we can help them financially.'' Campbell did
not give specifics.
   The Miami-based rap group sued after Sheriff Nick Navarro sent
his deputies in March to warn retailers they faced arrest for
selling the album. The sheriff acted after a county judge said the
material was ``probably obscene.''
   Gonzalez said the sheriff's office engaged in prior restraint of
free speech by threatening owners before the recording was ruled
obscene.
   The judge listened to 2 Live Crew's recording, which offers a
frank, detailed discussion of sexual positions and practices. He
also heard witnesses and legal anti-censorship arguments May 14-15
before issuing his opinion.
   Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences, issued a statement in Los Angeles denouncing the
court's ruling as politically motivated.
   ``It pungently underlines the oppressive right-wing political
agenda that is attempting to legislate morality in all the arts,
including music. It's another attempt to smother freedom in this
country, freedom for the recording artist.''
   In the three hours before his arrest, Freeman said, he sold all
but six copies of the recording. He said a line had formed outside
the shop in anticipation of the shipment's arrival.
   ``I'll go to jail, and I'll come back and sell it again,'' he
said. ``I opened up a record store three years ago expecting to sell
records and this was the furthest thing from my mind.''
   Authorities confiscated the remaining recordings.
   Friends and customers packed into E-C Records to complain after
he was taken to jail for booking on the misdemeanor charge.
   Assistant manager Edward G. Robinson said Freeman felt strongly
about the issue.
   ``If we can buy them, Mr. Freeman will sell them,'' Robinson
said, adding that he won't. ``Personally, I don't care for the
inside of a jail cell.''
   ``Why they'd pick this one guy?'' asked Gary White, 27, in the
shop with his 19-month-old son. ``Once they take the rights away
from one guy, it's going to spread. It's not right when a person
can't express himself.''
   The judge's obscenity ruling has no legal effect outside south
Florida, but civil libertarians see a practical effect spreading
nationally.
   Supplies of the disputed record dried up in the Miami area as the
obscenity case was argued, but the decision was expected to boost
sales elsewhere.
   The decision had no effect on the group's plans for shows Friday
night at Club Nu in Miami Beach and Saturday night at Club Futura in
nearby Hollywood.
   The group planned to perform its sexually explicit material both
nights at a late show for adults, after an early, cleaned-up show
for all ages, Campbell said.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo, returning from
talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, predicted Friday that the Korean
peninsula will be reunified within 10 years.
   The 45-year-long division of the Korean peninsula between
pro-Western South Korea and Communist North Korea was a key subject
in Roh's talks with the Soviet leader in San Francisco and later
discussions with President Bush in Washington.
   Roh said his Monday meeting with Gorbachev, the first ever
between the leaders of the two nations without diplomatic relations,
turned ``a new page of history to herald an end to the Cold War on
the Korean peninsula.''
   He said unification with North Korea would be realized ``before
the present century is out.''
   ``I have returned home with high hopes the next generation of
Koreans will live in a peaceful and unified land, free of the danger
of war,'' Roh said in his arrival statement.
   ``President Gorbachev and I confirmed that rapprochement had
already begun ... and agreed that full diplomatic relations ought to
be achieved before long,'' he said.
   Roh urged North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to abandon isolationism
and accept repeated invitations to a summit.
   Roh has been pursuing a policy of establishing ties with Eastern
European and Communist countries to bring pressure on North Korea to
ease its hard-line policies.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on Friday praised Roh's diplomatic
success but warned the president will face ``civil resistance'' if
he does not match it with domestic reforms.
   Korea was divided in 1945 at the end of World War II, and the two
Koreas fought a three-year war beginning in 1950.
   The border between the two nations is one of the most heavily
fortified in the world. It is guarded by more than 1 million
soldiers.

<HEAD>Bulgarians Demand Closure of Romanian Chlorine Factory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 6,000 Bulgarians rallied Friday
at the Friendship Bridge spanning the Danube River at the border
with Romania to demand the closure of a Romanian chlorine factory.
   Chanting ``Close the Factory!'' ``We Want Clean Air!'' and
``Assassins!'' the flag-waving demonstrators, most from the
Bulgarian border city of Russe, accused the Romanian government of
refusing to deal seriously with chemical pollution that drifts
across the Danube.
   Romanian officials have said the 15-year-old factory in Giurgiu,
37 miles south of Bucharest, will not be closed, but will be
equipped with anti-pollution devices in the near future.
   While more than 6,000 Bulgarians turned out, only 30 Romanians
showed up for the protest. The two sides joined hands in the middle
of the bridge.
   Carrying a banner saying ``Purity everywhere and in everything,''
58-year-old Maria Koleva from Russe, which has a population of
200,000, complained about the sooty, black, thick air that local
residents breathe.
   ``Our throats are always sore, and so are our eyes. ... We have
serious lung problems in Russe,'' Koleva said. ``I sometimes think
of not sending my child out in the street.''
   The Bulgarian news agency, BTA, said Romanian and Bulgarian
experts will meet in Bucharest on Saturday to discuss the need for
urgent action to stop chlorine emissions from the plant.
   ``People should be given food and salaries _ you cannot just
leave them unemployed closing down factories,'' Petre Marcuta, the
Romanian Environment Minister said in a recent interview.
   The earthquake and strong aftershock that rocked Romania and
Bulgaria last week sparked renewed fears on both sides of the border
of what could happen if the chlorine factory were damaged.
   Bulgarian experts quoted by BTA reported a 137 percent increase
in chlorine emissions from the factory since the earthquake.
   The protest, organized by the Bulgarian environmental group
Ecoglasnost and the Romanian Ecological Movement, came two days
before Bulgaria's first free elections since 1932.
   The issue of chemical emissions at the plant was first raised in
1986 when the concentration of chlorine released by the factory
started to rise.
   After a 1987 demonstration, then Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu stopped the production of chlorine and hydrochloric acid,
but three 80-ton reservoirs of chlorine are still in use for the
production of other chemicals at the factory.
   Ceausescu was deposed and executed in Romania's December
revolution.

   Explosions rocked a chemical packaging
plant Friday, sending up bright orange flames and clouds of black
smoke visible from downtown Houston 12 miles away. Two employees
were hurt.
   Firefighters said the blaze at the Solvents &amp; Chemicals Inc.
plant in an industrial area south of Houston could burn for days.
Authorities called for an evacuation of the surrounding area as the
fire raged, but few people left and the order was lifted in about
six hours.
   The most seriously injured person was Eloy Salazar, a 26-year-old
employee who told his doctor that a spark from a forklift touched
off the explosion at about 11 a.m.
   ``They were apparently depressurizing some 55-gallon drums and
there was a spark, I believe from a fork lift, and that set off the
fire,'' said Dr. Jeff Britton of Houston Hermann Hospital.
   Salazar worker suffered second- and third-degree burns on his
chest, face and back.
   Another employee, Alexander Jacky, 49, was being treated at
Southeast Memorial Hospital in Pearland for minor burns to his
forearm and released. Six firefighters and emergency workers were
treated for heat exhaustion or smoke inhalation at Southeast,
officials said.
   Dr. Paul Pepe, Houston Emergency Medical Service director, said
the fire apparently occurred outside the main building when a vapor
cloud that escaped from a container ignited.
   The two men were injured as they tried to flee the fire.
   Forty other employees were evacuated safely, according to the
company. ``All of our people are out,'' spokesman Jordi Baizan said.
   Baizan said the company packages paint and lacquer thinners,
windshield washing products and charcoal starters. He said most of
its products are nontoxic.
   Richard Hawkins, division manager for the City of Houston
Emergency Medical Service, said multiple types of solvents,
including paint thinner, were burning at the plant.
   Emergency officials were keeping a close eye on the remaining
storage tanks.
   ``There are several storage tanks nearby the fire and that's our
biggest concern right now,'' Hawkins said.
   Howard Manning, director of operations for the Chemical
Transportation Emergency Center of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association in Washington, said there was no way of knowing how long
it will take to bring the situation under control.
   ``Some of these things go on for days,'' he said.

   The federal government has no proof that millions of
dollars seized from financial institutions in South Florida is
linked to a drug cartel and should give the money back to account
holders, attorneys argued Friday.
   In a nationwide money laundering crackdown in April and May, the
government seized 658 accounts worth over $400 million. It
subsequently released all but 102 accounts, including 88 in South
Florida.
   U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt heard two hours of arguments
Friday, but gave no indication when she would rule on a defense
motion to free the accounts seized in Operation Polar Cap.
   The judge said she would rule later.
   Prosecutors contended there was probable cause to believe the
money came from drug smuggling.
   Scores of lawyers representing the 88 claimants crowded Nesbitt's
courtroom, but let their positions be represented by a half dozen
attorneys.
   Attorney Mark Schnapp charged that while the government claimed
the seized accounts were tied to the Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel, they had presented no proof of this when they froze the
accounts and the complaint was based on ``stale information.''
   Attorney Fred Schwartz said he represented a U.S. citizen named
Mark Levy who lives in Barranquilla, Colombia.
   ``Mr. Levy is a U.S. citizen with two children who pays his taxes
in the U.S. and in Colombia and sends his children to school in the
United States,'' said Schwartz, who said the seizure made it
impossible for his client to pay his children's bills.
   In defense of the government's case, assistant U.S. Attorney
Blanton Allen told the court Friday that in January 1990, after the
overthrow of Manuel Noriega in Panama, a bank there pleaded guilty
to charges involving money laundering.
   Transfers of funds from Medellin cartel sources resulted, Allen
said, coming to accounts in Miami banks. The accounts were traced
and the government has the ``day and dates and chapter and verse,''
Allen said.
   ``These people are not charged and will never appear in court in
criminal matters,'' Allen said. ``They may not be involved, but
their money is.''
   Schwartz and other attorneys have said in the past that their
clients bought dollars in Latin America on the black market _ a huge
pot of money swelled by the cocaine trade _ without knowing the cash
was drug-tainted.
   Account holders have denied laundering was involved, insisting
the money was ``flight capital'' removed from unstable South
American governments.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of Bulgaria's three major
parties all called for a coalition government after Sunday's
elections to tackle the nation's serious economic and political
problems.
   But Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the opposition Union of Democratic
Forces, said Friday night that the UDF was not prepared to enter
into a coalition with the former Communists, now the governing
Socialist Party.
   Joining Zhelev in a television debate on political and economic
topics were Socialist Party chief Alexander Lilov and Viktor Valkov,
who leads the mainstream Agrarian Party.
   The three parties are expected to take most of the popular vote
on Sunday when a total of 38 parties compete in Bulgaria's first
free multiparty elections since 1932.
   Zhelev declared, ``We are ready to take part in a coalition with
the ASP,'' the Alternative Socialist Party that broke from the
former Communist Party after the last party congress early this year.
   ``In a coalition with the Socialist Party we cannot take part;
not only because of political bias, but because it is still burdened
(from the past) and cannot carry out the changes Bulgaria needs,''
Zhelev insisted.
   He said such a coalition may be possible at some future stage,
but ``it is not enough (for a Communist Party) to wake up and be a
Socialist Party.''
   He was referring to last April's name change.
   All three men refrained from personal attacks or strong
criticism, avoiding serious dispute two days prior to the voting.
   The debate was in sharp contrast with campaign violence and harsh
accusations that may be settled in court long after the elections.
   The only real argument came when Lilov rejected a ``shock
therapy'' for the national economy.
   The slogan, used early in the campaign by UDF officials, was
dropped later, but Likov described it as unfeasible and dangerous.
   Zhelev said it was discarded to defuse Socialist claims it would
cause chaos.
   ``We are for a quick, well-thought-out, radical road to a market
economy,'' the UDF chairman said.
   ``When a Bulgarian goes to a shop and finds no sugar, this is a
shock, or when he hears about an $11 billion foreign debt and has
seen none of the money ... that is a shock _ and there is no
therapy,'' offered by the Socialists, he declared.
   ``Let us not frighten people with shock therapy, neither you nor
we are interested in this.''
   Likov pressed his argument, saying such a course of action had
caused 3,700 percent annual inflation in Argentina.
   Valkov called for integrating ``the party of the non-affiliated
people. They have a lot of good, dignified people in their ranks.''
   Lilov said his party was ready to form a broad coalition on the
basis of national consensus, and ``we hold out the hand to all
political parties.''
   Zhelev complained about remnants of totalitarianism, including
the ``one- party government.''
   He and Lilov also disagreed on the need for private ownership,
with Lilov saying, ``Private ownership by itself will not take us
out of the crisis.''
   The three politicians agreed they would respect the voters'
decision Sunday.
   Bulgaria's longtime, hard-line Communist Party chief, Todor
Zhivkov, was ousted last November.

<HEAD>East German Ex-Spy Chief Says KGB May Be New Boss for Some</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Markus Wolf, East Germany's
celebrated former spy chief, was quoted Friday as saying some former
agents may now be working for the Soviet KGB.
   However, Wolf said he thought any such defections were individual
cases, rather than the result of wholesale recruitment, according to
an interview in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper of Munich.
   Wolf called for a meeting of officials from both Germanys to try
to resolve the problem of inner-German espionage. He predicted the
longer it takes to resolve how a united Germany deals with former
Communist spies, the greater the danger even more East German agents
will defect to other spy networks.
   Wolf, 67, recently returned to East Berlin from Moscow, where he
said he went to finish work on a book. West German counter-espionage
officials alleged he was meeting with the KGB to turn over East
Germany's spy network in West Germany.
   Wolf retired in 1987 as head of foreign intelligence in Communist
East Germany's Security Ministry, where he gained a reputation as
one of the most skilled intelligence chiefs in the East bloc.
   West Germany has an arrest warrant out for him for his espionage
activities, but Wolf is protected as long as the two Germansy remain
separate countries. West German officials have not yet decided how
they will handle East German spies after unification.
   The Munich Abendzeitung newspaper on Friday quoted Guenther
Beckstein, a senior official in the Bavarian Interior Ministry, as
saying East Germany should hand Wolf over to West Germany for
prosecution.
   Beckstein likened Wolf's case to that of suspected terrorist
Susanne Albrecht, who was captured by East German authorities in
East Berlin on Wednesday and is expected to be turned over to West
Germany next week.
   In Bonn, spokesman Roland Bachmeier of the West German Interior
Ministry said a meeting of the two German interior ministers in
April provided the information that led to Albrecht's capture. West
German authorities had sought Ms. Albrecht, a suspected member of
the leftist Red Army faction, for 13 years.
   The Red Army faction has been blamed for a wave of terror in West
Germany since the early 1970s.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu stood up to heavy U.S.
pressure Friday and refused one of Washington's key demands to make
Japan's economy more accessible to American businesses.
   Kaifu's tough stand suggests his government can assert itself,
despite Washington's threats to retaliate if Japan fails to slash
its $49 billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Kaifu's decision comes even as some observers are detecting a
change in Japan's legendary resistance to imports. On Thursday,
Japan accepted U.S. technology as the standard for a new generation
of cellular phones.
   But Kaifu said Japan would not give in to a U.S. demand that it
set an annual timetable for increasing spending on public works. The
demand was raised in the Structural Impediments Initiative talks,
which are aimed at eliminating structural trade barriers.
   Kaifu said this had settled the issue. ``I don't quite understand
why they are raising the issue again,'' he told reporters.
   The prime minister spoke on the same day Kyodo news service
quoted an unidentified senior U.S. official as saying Japan was
dragging its feet in preparing a final trade report outlining more
reforms.
   Japan agreed in April to boost public spending, which would
expand the number of projects that U.S. firms could bid on. The
United States demanded a definite annual spending target, something
Japan refused to provide. Instead, it said it would specify a total
figure for the next 10 years overall.
   Japan also agreed in April to deregulate its complex distribution
system, including a relaxation on the establishment of large retail
stores, to increase enforcement of antitrust laws with tougher
penalties for bid-rigging, and to work to lower land prices.
   Cited by Washington as an unfair trade partner in satellites,
supercomputers and forest products, Japan last month agreed to
expand opportunities for U.S. businesses in those industries.
   After the agreement, President Bush dropped Japan from the list
of unfair trade partners under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. Countries
on the list can face tariffs of up to 100 percent on certain goods.
   But some congressmen in Washington still want Japan on the list.
   U.S. and Japanese negotiators will meet in Tokyo on June 25-26 to
hammer out the final report on the Structural Impediments
Initiative. But the Japanese government already has begun to
implement some of the reforms.
   Last month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told
local governments it had shortened the application period for
opening large retail stores. This will benefit U.S. retailers.
   On June 6, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued new guidelines
that would prohibit manufacturers from pressuring discount shops
that sell goods below manufacturer-recommended prices.
   But the most potent symbol of Japan's recent willingness to open
its markets may be its adoption Thursday of digital cellular-phone
technology by Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill.
   Motorola's CODEC speech coder system _ the technology to
digitalize voice sounds and send them to a receiving unit _
outperformed six Japanese and one Swedish company to be chosen as
the national standard, Japanese officials said.
   ``That has been unthinkable during the past 40 years, but it
happened,'' said Richard C. Koo, senior economist with the Nomura
Research Institute, a think tank connected with Nomura Securities.
``I was stunned.''
   Japan's cellular phone market is estimated to be worth about $2
billion over the next five years, enough to put a dent in the $49
billion trade imbalance.
   The imbalance has been shrinking yearly from a high of $56.3
billion in 1987. It has been declining more dramatically this year,
with a surplus in March of $3.6 billion, down 14.3 percent from a
year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   A major reason for the decline since 1987 has been the yen's
strength compared to the dollar, which makes Japanese products more
expensive overseas and imports cheaper.
   But some economists say a more fundamental reason for the decline
is that Japan is finally becoming a consumption-oriented society
after years of sacrifice to build the economy.

   The government announced Friday it
will release $1.26 million in saving certificates that have been
frozen since U.S. economic sanctions were placed on the country.
   Vice President Guillermo Ford, head of National Banking
Commission, announced the ``total freeing up of saving certificates
and normalization of the banking system'' July 10.
   During the past two years holders of the savings certificates,
similar to bank certificates of deposit, have been prohibited from
withdrawing their money.
   The restriction was imposed in 1988 after the U.S. sanctions
forced the closure of banks for two months.
   The sanctions, designed to pressure Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
to step down from power, ended after Noriega's overthrow in December
in a U.S. military invasion. Noriega is in prison in Miami, awaiting
trial on federal drug trafficking charges.
   Under the bank freeze, depositors were only allowed to withdraw
10 percent of the money in their savings accounts, and checking
accounts were also frozen.
   Last year, restrictions on checking accounts were lifted. In
April, restrictions on an estimated $270 million in savings accounts
was also lifted.
   In December, the banking commission decided to maintain
restrictions on savings certificates until July, Ford said in a news
conference.
   The banking commission said banks had a total of $16 billion in
deposits in February.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela on Friday said the West should
maintain economic sanctions on South Africa until the white
government ends apartheid and the country is no longer considered
``the skunk of the world.''
   The African National Congress leader said the South African
economy then would require massive international aid ``if we are to
move forward at a pace that recognized the urgency of the needs of
our people.''
   Mandela, 71, on the second leg of a six-week, trans-Atlantic
trip, canceled a morning meeting with Red Cross officials due to
fatigue, a Red Cross spokeswoman said.
   But he spoke later to the International Labor Organization, the
World Council of Churches and Foreign Minister Rene Felber.
   Mandela received a loud ovation from more than 2,000 delegates to
the U.N. labor organization.
   He told the 150-nation assembly he was encouraged by Thursday's
lifting of the state of emergency in most of South Africa as well as
by the release of more political prisoners.
   ``These steps constitute part of the process of implementing what
was agreed (with President F.W. De Klerk) a month ago,'' he said.
``Of course, more will have to be done to ensure that the agreement
is implemented in full.''
   He said he was convinced that de Klerk and his colleagues ``are
men and women of integrity,'' but ``until what was agreed has been
done, we cannot afford to lower our guard'' and relax economic
sanctions.
   Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, concluded
his speech by speaking of ``the glorious vision of a South Africa
free of racism, free of racial antagonisms among our people, no
longer a threat to peace, no longer the skunk of the world.''
   The U.N. agency, which sets international standards for labor
conditions, expelled South Africa 25 years ago for its racial
policies.
   Under apartheid, the nation's 28 million blacks are deprived of a
say in the government, while the 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate services.
   At the Geneva headquarters of the World Council of Churches,
hundreds of supports gave Mandela the clenched-fist ANC salute.
   He thanked the meeting for the support given him and fellow
anti-apartheid fighters by the council, which has provided financial
assistance to the ANC for more than a decade.
   Speaking with a firm voice and without a text, he said
``religions, Christian and non-Christian, have been the only source
of hope for many years'' for him.
   During talks with the foreign minister, Mandela urged Switzerland
to add to Western pressure on South Africa and impose its own
sanctions against the country, a government spokesman said.
   Neutral Switzerland has never joined in the sanctions but has
repeatedly condemned racial segregation.
   Spokesman Michel Pache said that during the 90-minute meeting in
Bern, the capital, Felber said Switzerland was ready to promote
economic contacts with the ANC.
   Mandela will stay in Switzerland this weekend before continuing
to West Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, Ireland, Britain
and several African countries. He is scheduled to meet with Swiss
anti-apartheid groups and U.N. refugee officials Saturday.

   Guatemala on Friday announced national
elections for Nov. 11, opening the way for a crowded field of
presidential contenders that is expected to include former military
ruler Jose Efrain Rios Montt.
   The winner will succeed civilian President Vinicio Cerezo, whose
five-year term expires Jan. 14.
   The president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, Arturo
Herbruger, announced the election and said a runoff would be held
Jan. 6 if no presidential candidate wins a majority.
   Voters will also pick a vice president, 116 national deputies,
mayors, municipal councils and members to a new Central American
Parliament.
   The regional legislature, proposed by Cerezo to discuss regional
matters, has been ratified by El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua. Costa Rica has yet to do so.
   Guatemala's 19 registered political parties can start nominating
candidates Saturday.
   Those actively seeking the presidency include Rios Montt, a
former army brigidier general who took over in a coup in 1982 and
was ousted 17 months later.
   Most public opinion polls show Rios Montt leading a presidential
poll or trailing Jorge Carpio Nicolle of the National Center Union,
who lost to Cerezo.
   Other expected contenders are Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo of Cerezo's
Christian Democrat Party, Alvaro Azru of the Advanced National
Party, Manuel Ayau Cordon of the conservative National Liberation
Movement and Rene Leon Shlotter of the Democratic Socialist Party
and the Popular Alliance-5.

   Arsenic was found in freed hostage Frank Reed's
system shortly after his return to the United States, hospital
officials announced Friday.
   Reed, 57, has been undergoing treatment at the Malcolm Grow
Medical Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland since soon
after his release from 44 months in captivity in Lebanon April 30.
   In a statement, the hospital said screening for heavy metals such
as arsenic, lead and mercury was normal procedure for returning
hostages or prisoners.
   ``These tests were performed on Mr. Reed's arrival. The initial
test for arsenic was positive. Subsequent tests confirmed this
exposure to arsenic and its elimination to a non-toxic level,'' the
hospital said.
   Hospital officials were unavailable to say how much arsenic was
found, how it affected his health or how it might have gotten in
Reed's system.
   Reed's arsenic levels were abnormally high, Reed's attorney, Bob
Woolf, said in a telephone interview from Miami.
   ``This was beyond what was normal, believe me,'' Woolf said. ``It
was enough to be concerned about.''
   Woolf refused to comment on the possible source of the arsenic.
He said some of the toxin had been eliminated from Reed's body since
he began medical treatment, but that traces remained.
   ``It's not completely out of his system, but now it's at a
controlled non-toxic level,'' Woolf said.
   Reed's wife, Fahima, said she believed her husband had been
poisoned by his captors.
   ``What else could it be? The arsenic couldn't get in his body
just like that,'' she said.
   ``I'm outraged that they would have done something like this,''
she added. ``I'm just happy that he's OK, that nothing's been
damaged.''
   Dr. Alan Woolf, director of the Massachusetts Poison Center, said
trace amounts of arsenic could get into a person's system from water
and food, especially seafood.
   ``You or I might have traces of arsenic in our blood after a
heavy seafood dinner,'' the doctor said. ``It's used as a wood
preservative and as a pesticide.''
   Peggy Say, sister of hostage Terry Anderson, said she was
appalled by the news, and worried it could mean other hostages could
also be affected.
   ``If the arsenic poisoning is deliberate, it is the worst kind of
barbarism,'' Ms. Say said by telephone from her home in Cadiz, Ky.
``If it is not deliberate, they are apparently living in conditions
in which their surroundings are putting this arsenic into their
systems. Either way, it is an extremely serious problem.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was taken hostage March 16, 1985. Reed has said he last saw
Anderson between a year and 18 months ago.
   The attorney said Reed was surprised by the finding.
   ``It was a little shocking and frightening for him,'' Woolf said.
``This was serious and totally unexpected.''
   The attorney said it was still unclear how the poison would
affect Reed's health. The Malden, Mass., native was gaunt and weak
after his release, and during a Memorial Day visit to his hometown
he said he suffered from severe anemia.
   ``We still don't know what all the ramifications are,'' Woolf
said. ``But he seems to be coming along fine. He's gaining weight
and I'm hopeful he'll be released in a few weeks.''
   Reed was the director of the private Lebanese International
School in Beirut when he was seized by Islamic extremists in 1986.
After his release he told of being beaten when he tried to escape
and of being chained and blindfolded for months at a time.
   Arsenic, a silvery-white poisonous chemical element, is used to
make insecticides, glass, medicines and semiconductors. Exposure to
high levels of the substance can produce a burning pain in the
esophagus and stomach, vomiting, diarrhea and depression.
   Prolonged exposure can lead to a rapid, feeble pulse and
circulatory collapse.

   The National Science Foundation said Friday it
would back a major research effort aimed at developing long-distance
data exchange networks that can work 20 to 700 times faster than
today's best.
   The foundation and the Defense Department's research agency, the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, will spend $15 million
over the next three years to develop five experimental mini-networks
that can transfer data at 1 billion bits, a gigabit, per second.
   Collaborators, including government agencies, universities,
computer companies and communications firms, are expected to
contribute several times as much money, the foundation said.
   Such a speed would enable 70 fat novels of 300,000 words each to
be transmitted every second.
   Today's fiber optic cables can carry data that fast from point to
point; it is the switches and data-handling routines for a network
that must be developed, and these are only now beginning to emerge
from the laboratory.
   ``This is what telephone companies will be bringing to the
table,'' said Charles Brownstein, acting assistant director for
computer and information sciences at the foundation.
   ``We don't even know yet that such a network can be developed,
and it may take until the next century to build one,'' said Alan
Levitt, a spokesman for the foundation.
   One of the experiments, if all goes well, will enable
neurosurgeons at the University of North Carolina to simulate an
operation using CAT-scan images of a patient's brain, called up from
a distant computer, before they operate on the actual patient.
   ``The surgeons will be able to say, `Let's see what happens when
we peel back this layer of tissue,' or, `Put that one back and let's
peel back this layer,''' said Brownstein. ``This requires a
tremendous data file.''
   Today's best networks, Brownstein said, operate at 1.5 million
bits per second to 45 million bits per second, or 188,000 to 5.6
million characters per second. A facsimile machine's best speed is
1,200 characters per second.

   Ten alleged participants in a male
prostitution ring will plead guilty next week to reduced charges,
authorities said Friday.
   Seven men from Indianapolis and one each from Chicago, Detroit
and St. Louis will be charged, Indianapolis police said.
   Investigators already have contacted the men and each is willing
to plead guilty to one count of prostitution in return for
prosecutors not pursuing additional charges, police spokesman Andrew
Stoner said.
   The prostitution charge is a Class A misdemeanor with a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a $5,000 fine.
   The men are expected to surrender beginning next week in Marion
County Municipal Court, Stoner said. If any of the 10 do not reach a
plea agreement by June 29, warrants would be issued beginning July
2. Extradition would be pursued on the out-of-state cases, he said.
   ``All 10 of these people will be charged, regardless of whether
they come forward,'' Stoner said. ``We would consider this,
generally speaking, to be the conclusion of the matter.''
   Stan Berg, publisher of the midwestern gay newspaper The New
Works News, accused Marion County Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith of
exploiting anti-gay biases for political gain.
   If alleged prostitutes were being prosecuted, their patrons also
should be charged, Berg said. But authorities are unwilling to
expend the manpower or money to pursue more than 500 people, he
added.
   The prostitution ring, which investigators have said involved 396
patrons from 39 states, Guam, Canada and South Korea, operated
primarily in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.
   Police said the names of 116 prostitutes surfaced in the
investigation but most cannot be charged for a variety of reasons,
including expiration of the two-year statute of limitations and a
lack of information.

   The Arab League's U.N. envoy Friday said
Israel's new hard-line government was a ``blessing in disguise'' and
said the right-wing adiministration might force the United States to
get tougher with its ally.
   Clovis Maksoud, permanent observer of the 22-nation Arab League,
said the government, which will consist of acting Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and smaller ultranationalist
and religious parties, could force Congress to reexamine its
relationship with Israel.
   Shamir's government, which still needs parliamentary approval,
has vowed to expand Jewish settlement in the occupied territories,
and has indicated it is prepared to use harsher measures to quell
the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The United States has called Jewish settlements an obstacle to
peace and has tried to encourage Israel to open peace talks with a
Palestinian delegation.
   ``I hope formation of this new Cabinet will jolt the U.S.
administration and the U.S. Congress to come back to their
historical sense of fairness in the Middle East,'' Maksoud said
after a strategy meeting with Arab representatives.
   ``This can be a blessing in disguise if it awakens the U.S.
administration from permissiveness to allow Israel to proceed with
the defiance of the international community,'' he added.
   Maksoud also criticized the United States saying it has shielded
Israel from international censure by using its veto in the U.N.
Security Council.
   On Thursday, the United States blocked an Arab-sponsored Security
Council resolution calling for a U.N. team to visit the occupied
territories and investigate allegations of Israeli abuses of
Palestinian human rights.
   Arab states plan to reintroduce the measure.

   Retired Adm. Alfredo Poveda, who led a
military junta that ruled Ecuador from 1976 until turning over power
to a civilian government in 1979, died of a heart attack in Miami,
his family said Friday. He was 64.
   Poveda had traveled to Miami for medical treatment, his family
said. He died Thursday, and his family said the body was flown to
the port of Guayaquil, where a funeral with military honors was
scheduled for Saturday.
   The government issued no comment on the death of Poveda, who
Ecuadoran politicians have called the most benign of the military
dictators who dominated Latin America in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   He was born in Ambato, a mountain city 75 miles south of Quito,
and studied in the United States, Argentina and Brazil during his
rise in the navy.
   In 1976, the admiral replaced Gen. Guillermo Rodriguez Lara, who
four years earlier had overthrown five-term President Jose Maria
Velasco Ibarra after the civilian canceled elections and declared
himself dictator.
   Although Poveda reached power through the military hierarchy, he
set up a system to return the government to civilian power. The
constitutional process he helped develop, which allows for no
presidential re-election and a one-house legislature, survives today.
   He named a group of judges and lawyers to develop a new
alternative to the 1945 constitution. Voters, given the choice
between the two documents in a 1978 plebiscite, chose the new
constitution.
   Poveda in 1979 turned over power to the winner of general
elections, Jaime Roldos Aguilera. He then retired from the military.

   A gutted bottlenosed dolphin found

   The 8-foot-long male dolphin was found Monday on a Delaware Bay

   ``It's possible someone was trying to cover up that they had

   Depending on the circumstances, killing a dolphin can be a

   Maoist guerrillas shot to death eight people
and set off a car bomb during a rash of pre-election attacks in the
Andes, police said Friday.
   The Shining Path guerrillas assassinated seven people Thursday in
different neighborhoods of Ayacucho, 230 miles southeast of Lima,
police said. In addition, they shot to death a university student in
Huancayo, 120 miles east of Lima.
   In Huaraz, 175 miles north of Lima, rebels blew up 22 pounds of
dynamite in a car parked near a military barracks late Thursday. A
passer-by was injured, but the 12 soldiers inside the barracks were
unhurt.
   The attacks came as all three Andean cities face weekend ``armed
strikes'' called by the insurgents to prevent voters from taking
part in Sunday's presidential runoff. The Shining Path often
enforces ``armed strikes'' through violence.
   In Sunday's elections, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa faces
agricultural engineer Alberto Fujimori. According to polls, the two
are running neck-and-neck.
   More than 18,500 people have been killed in political violence
since the Shining Path began its armed insurgency 10 years ago.

   President Bush said Friday night ``we're making
progress'' in easing Soviet fears about a united Germany in NATO.
Bush said he and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed that
Moscow has ``understandable interests'' in the military future of
Europe.
   Bush and Kohl met for more than two hours over dinner at the
White House to discuss Germany unification and Soviet objections to
a new Germany belonging to the U.S.-led NATO alliance.
   The meeting, their third in three weeks, came on the heels of
Bush's summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
expressed strong concerns about NATO membership for a united Germany.
   Bush said that Western leaders, at a NATO summit in London early
next month, would explore ways to allay Soviet fears.
   Kohl said, ``We Germans, as a matter of course ... also are going
to bear in mind Soviet security. It's going to be important that
NATO and the Warsaw Pact meet in a good atmosphere.''
   Gorbachev, in opposing NATO membership for a united Germany, has
proposed that the new country be a member of both the Warsaw Pact as
well as NATO, or be a member of neither. He also has suggested
limits on the size of the German army, an idea opposed both by Kohl
and Bush.
   ``Any singling out and neutralization always means isolation,''
Kohl said. ``Out of the isolation of Germany which we had in the
'20s, a lot of bad things came about. We want a unified Germany as
part of NATO.''
   Bush expressed confidence that Gorbachev's fears would be laid to
rest.
   ``I think we're making progress but I can't make a prediction as
to how successful, totally successful, we're going to be,'' Bush
said.
   Bush and Kohl emphasized that there is no difference between them
in insisting that a new Germany be a full military and political
member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance.
   ``I never expected that this important question could be solved
overnight,'' Kohl said.
   He voiced hopes that the so-called two-plus-four talks involving
the four allied victors of World War II and the two Germanies
complete their work by fall. The participants are the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France, West Germany and East Germany.
   Bush, returning from an overnight political trip to the Midwest,
met Kohl before heading off the Camp David for the weekend. Kohl,
who gave the commencement address at Harvard University on Thursday,
headed home.
   Bush said that he and Kohl agreed that the Soviets _ who lost 27
million people in World War II triggered by German aggression _
``have understandable interests in all of this, but we did not try
to fashion some compromise'' solution.
   Asked why he felt so confident about winning over the Soviets,
Bush said, ``I just had the feeling'' from talks with Gorbachev that
the Soviet leader was moving toward the West's position.
   ``They also paid some lip service, gave some credibility, to the
idea that a country could choose what alliance it was going to be
in,'' Bush said.
   ``The facts are on our side,'' the president said. ``A united
Germany in NATO will not be threatening to the Soviet Union. A U.S.
presence (in Europe) will not be threatening to the Soviet Union.
So, we've just got to keep on making our case.''
   In fact, Poland and Czechoslovakia, still nominally allies of the
Soviet Union and East Germany in the Warsaw Pact, have said they
prefer a united Germany in NATO to one outside the alliance.
   Bush told political fundraising audiences in Omaha and Des Moines
that the German issues will not be resolved easily or quickly.
   ``We must see that German reunification adheres to the wishes of
the German people, while respecting the views of other nations,''
Bush told a luncheon for Republican senatorial candidate Hal Daub.
   ``Serious differences still remain,'' he said.
   Earlier, at a fundraising speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Bush said
that agreements struck at the summit, ``we hope, represent the
beginning of the end of the Cold War.''
   Gorbachev has said repeatedly that the Cold War is already over.
   Asked by reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Omaha from
Des Moines whether he and Gorbachev had different views on this
subject, Bush said:
   ``I don't know. We've got a difference of semantics, don't we.
   ``We've got to wait and see how we can resolve all these problems
out here. There are plenty of them around.''
   However, he added in his remarks on the presidential aircraft,
``I felt the summit moved in the right direction.''
   Bush said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III, returning
to Washington for the meeting with Kohl, was bringing with him ``a
certain degree of optimism'' from his talks in Europe on the German
issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   But, Bush added, ``We'll have to wait and see.''
   Soviet officials have also suggested that a 35-nation European
council, made up of East and West bloc states, take over the roles
of the two post-World War II alliances. The United States has
rejected that idea.
   As he wrapped up two days of political campaigning in Wisconsin,
Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, Bush continued to emphasize the
importance to the farm belt of trade and grain agreements made at
last week's superpower summit.
   On other matters, Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One:
   _That he hopes the Senate will ustain his veto of a $2 billion
transportation authorization bill, which includes funds for Amtrak,
and not follow the example of the House, which voted on Thursday to
override the veto. However, Bush conceded, ``I think it's going to
be very close.''
   _That he views as unfortunate the shoving by a Secret Service
agent of Condoleezza Rice, Bush's senior adviser on Soviet affairs
and the highest ranking black woman at the White House. She was
shoved while accompanying Gorbachev in San Francisco. Bush said it
was important to see that such an episode does not happen again
while adding that ``I have great respect for the Secret Service and
how they do their job.''

   A full moon and high tides brought
horseshoe crabs to the shores of the Delaware Bay on Friday for
their yearly mating game.
   The females dug into beaches along the bay, laying millions of
green, shotgun pellet-sized eggs. Many of them had males hooked onto
their tails and each would drag the male over the eggs so he could
fertilize the batch.
   Horseshoe crabs, with long, spiked tails, are known to completely
cover beaches, laying shell-to-shell while shore birds and seagulls
hover around eating the eggs.
   On Friday, there was also a human factor in the scenario.
   Volunteers hit the beaches in Delaware and New Jersey, counting
and tagging the menacing-looking creatures.
   The plans called for tagging 2,000 horseshoe crabs in Delaware
alone.
   The work is part of research being conducted in both states to
learn about their migration patterns and lifespans.
   Delaware Bay has the largest numbers of horseshoe crabs on the
East Coast, according to Tim Jacobsen, an assistant research
professor at Rutgers University. They are found as far north as New
Hampshire and as far south as Florida, Jacobsen said.
   In Delaware Bay, no one knows how large the population is, how
long the horseshoe crabs live or whether their numbers are declining.
   ``We want to see if the population is stable. Is it going up? Is
it going down?'' said Marian Johnson Pohlman, outdoor recreation
planner for Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge near Smyrna.
Pohlman was in charge of counting at Port Mahon, just east of Little
Creek.
   She said people use horseshoe crabs for bait and officials need
to know if too many are being taken. It takes a horseshoe crab 11
years to mature and be able to lay eggs, Pohlman said.

<HEAD>Kill Van Kull Cleanup Could Take Two Months, Tar Balls Hit Beaches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It may take two months to clean 260,000
gallons of heavy heating oil that leaked from a grounded British
tanker into a commercial waterway, the Coast Guard said Friday.
   The Coast Guard said it had received reports of grapefruit-size
tar balls as far as 15 miles away, coming ashore along Sandy Hook
and Breezy Point, the points that flank the mouth of New York Harbor.
   About 9,000 gallons of the industrial fuel has been recovered so
far, said Coast Guard Capt. Robert North, adding that usually just
15 percent to 20 percent of a spill is recaptured.
   North is overseeing the cleanup that began when the BT Nautilus
ran aground early Thursday morning while docking in Bayonne.
   The remainder of the oil will either dissipate or sink in the
Kill Van Kull, a shipping channel between and Staten Island, N.Y.
and an industrial stretch of New Jersey shoreline, officials said.
   The Coast Guard, and the New York and New Jersey attorney's
general offices were all investigating the spill. Civil and criminal
charges were considered, said Judith Yaskin, New Jersey Commissioner
for the Environment.
   The accident, one of several significant oil spills in the New
York Harbor this year, boosted the amount spilled in the area to
more than 1 million gallons, or four times the 1989 total, the Coast
Guard said. That is less than one-tenth the size of the catastrophic
Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Gene Henn said a board of inquiry will
begin hearings Monday ``because we do not know if it is bad luck or
a common thread that binds these incidents.'' The board is to make
recommendations within ``weeks, not months,'' he said.
   The tanker's first mate, Englishman Geoffrey Frederick Gregory,
52, faces state charges of operating a vessel while under the
influence of either alcohol or drugs.
   He pleaded innocent at his arraignment Thursday, was released on
bail, and is to appear in Bayonne Municipal Court on June 12.
   He is also charged with negligent discharge of a pollutant
without a permit. The case is to be presented to a state grand jury
in Trenton next week, said Christopher Florentz, a spokesman for
Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo, adding that the investigation
is continuing.
   Capt. James Sanial, in charge of the Coast Guard probe, said
until the grounding there was no communication between Gregory, on
duty at the front of the boat, and the captain and pilot in the
ship's bridge.
   The tanker's captain, Albert Ainscough, and docking pilot, Jim
Naughton, were interviewed after the accident and said they noticed
nothing amiss until the grounding.
   Sanial said Naughton had no previous record of accidents.
   ``Ultimately, the master (captain) is always responsible for the
ship. In actual practice, the pilot takes over (during docking),''
said Sanial.
   More than 200 workers, including about 50 guardsmen, were
cleaning the water and shores Friday, said North. The operation
involved 47 vessels, including five boats equipped to skim oil from
the surface, and a special Coast Guard oil spill response team from
Mobile, Ala.
   The tanker owner, Nautilus Motor Tanker of Gibraltar, has assumed
responsibility for the cleanup, the Coast Guard said. The tanker is
operated by Bulk Tanker Management of London and registered in Hong
Kong.

   Roy and Marge Heimdal marched into a Peoria
bank Friday, clutching coffee cans stuffed with money as they
concluded a fund-raising campaign to ransom their son held in South
America.
   In less than four days, the Heimdals raised $60,000 demanded as
ransom by Maoist guerrillas who ambushed 27-year-old Scott Heimdal
in a jungle in Ecuador on April 28.
   Mrs. Heimdal, 47, said the kidnappers, reportedly members of a
Colombian group known as the Popular Liberation Army, have
threatened to ``show us where his body is.''
   The attack left one man dead and another seriously injured.
   ``A shiver went down my spine when they told me we had $60,000,''
Roy Heimdal said Friday, about 80 hours after the financially
strapped family went on TV to seek public help in raising money.
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Heimdal, who sells cabinets. ``If there had
been any other way to handle this, we would have. But a public
appeal was the only avenue we had.''
   Even as the Heimdals fought their way through a herd of reporters
into the bank, strangers approached with dollar bills for their
overflowing coffee cans and words of encouragement.
   ``For the first few weeks, we felt so helpless,'' Mrs. Heimdal
said. ``At least these past few days we've felt like we were helping
Scott. We were doing something and that felt good.''
   The $60,000 was wired to a bank in Ecuador where it will be taken
by an intermediary into the jungle along the Ecuador-Colombia border
this weekend to meet the kidnappers.
   ``The funds will be handled by a professional negotiators who
have been handling this situation for us. It'll be their
responsibility to get some of the funds to the kidnappers,'' though
probably not all of the money at first ``and make a deal to get him
out of there,'' Heimdal said late Friday.
   He said he didn't expect any further major developments until
sometime next week.
   In Quito, a U.S. Embassy official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said U.S. diplomats weren't involved in negotiations with
the guerrillas. `The negotiations are between the police and the
terrorists,'' the official said.
   The money was to be accompanied by a videotaped plea from his
mother.
   ``I pleaded for my son's life,'' she said. ``I begged. I said,
`Please give me my son back. He's my only son.' I've never begged
before. I don't know if I did it right.''
   But the family's work is far from over. There are passports to
get and the family must find a way to get from Miami to Quito.
Midway Airlines has provided free airline tickets to Miami.
   The family hopes it will all be capped next week by a
community-wide welcome home celebration for Heimdal.
   Heimdal and four others were traveling by motorboat on the
Bermeja River, about six miles from the border, when they were
ambushed by armed guerrillas. The guerrillas killed the pilot,
injured another and kidnapped Heimdal.
   Heimdal has worked the past two years at a dredging operation for
Iminco Co., a gold-mining company near Quito, Ecuador.

<TEXT>
   Prison author Jack Henry Abbott, acting as his
own lawyer in a wrongful death suit, Friday introduced himself with
an apology to the crying widow of the young actor he stabbed to
death nine years ago.
   ``I almost don't know what to say, except to say I'm very sorry
for the death of Richard Adan,'' Abbott told Ricci Adan, 32.
   Then, in their first exchange of words ever, Abbott asked Mrs.
Adan, ``Are you under the impression I murdered your husband?''
   Mrs. Adan looked at Abbott in apparent disbelief and said, ``I
know you killed my husband. I know you took a knife and thrust it
into his chest. I know he died. He's dead. He's not here.''
   Abbott, convicted of first-degree manslaughter in Adan's death,
maintains the slaying was not murder because he thought Adan was
going to harm him.
   Mrs. Adan said she refused to attend the trial in her husband's
death.
   ``You were not in my courtroom?'' Abbott seemed amazed.
   ``No, I didn't want to see all that,'' the widow said. ``I didn't
want to see you. I didn't want to hear you. You killed my husband.
How could you do that?''
   ``Does anything matter to you other than Richard Adan died at my
hands?''
   ``Yes,'' she replied. ``Something has to balance out. There has
to be some restitution, some kind of payback for what you did to my
husband.''
   Before Abbott began his disjointed cross-examination, Mrs. Adan
testified that her husband had won a role on a Public Broadcasting
System television series, a development she called ``a big break.''
   ``We were having dreams about our future together as a husband
and wife,'' Mrs. Adan said. ``Everything was so bright. He promised
me children. He said we wouldn't have to go hand-to-mouth anymore.
We wouldn't have to struggle so much.''
   Abbott, 46, convicted in 1982 of first-degree manslaughter in
Adan's death, is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence. Mrs. Adan has
sued Abbott for $10 million for her husband's wrongful death and
pain and suffering.
   Abbott gained fame from writing ``In the Belly of the Beast,'' a
best-seller composed of letters he sent from prison to author Norman
Mailer from 1978 through 1981.
   During that period, Abbott was in prison first for bank robbery
and then for fatally stabbing another inmate. Mailer later supported
Abbott's parole, largely because of his writing talent.
   Mrs. Adan's lawyer estimates that Abbott has a little more than
$100,000 in an escrow account held by the sheriff in Manhattan in
case of a civil judgement in Mrs. Adan's favor.
   Abbott had been free six weeks when he killed Adan around 5 a.m.
July 18, 1981, in front of the Bini-Bon restaurant at Second Avenue
and Fifth Street. Adan was a waiter at the restaurant, partly owned
by his father-in-law.
   Earlier Friday, eyewitness Wayne Larsen reiterated that Abbott
stabbed Adan after sneaking up behind him, reaching around from
behind and plunging a knife into the victim's chest.
   On cross examination, Larsen got Abbott's standard question _
``Did you read my book?''
   Larsen said he began it but ``what I read was so revolting I had
not appetite for the rest. You were describing what it felt like to
plunge a knife into a man's chest.''
   Larsen also said he will never forget what he saw, but tries not
think about it. ``It's the lowest that I've seen a human being sink
to. That's you I'm talking about,'' he told Abbott.

   Some of the $6 million worth of paintings stolen
in what police called the city's largest art theft have been
recovered, the gallery director said Friday.
   Nicholas Hall, director of Colnaghi USA Ltd. on Manhattan's
wealthy Upper East Side, confirmed that some of the 19 Old Masters
paintings and eight drawings swiped have been found. A police
department spokesman, Officer Fred Weiner, couldn't immediately
confirm the recovery.
   Hall said no one had been arrested yet in the theft. He would not
say which works were recovered and refused to provide further
details, citing an ongoing police investigation.
   The most valuable pieces stolen were two 15-by-7 inch wood panels
by the 15th century Italian Renaissance master, Fra Angelico. The
panels, depicting saints, were worth a combined $4 million.
   Works by Lodovico Carracci, Pacino Da Bonaguida, Paolo Catamara,
Gasper Duguet and Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin were also stolen.
   In 1988, thieves broke in through a skylight in the brownstone
where the gallery was located and shinnied down a rope.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Baxley, an actress whose career
encompassed roles as diverse as Shakespeare in the park and TV's
``Hawaii Five-O,'' has died of an apparent heart attack. She was 63.
   Baxley was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment.
   Her Broadway debut was in 1948 when she played a confused bride
in the revival of Noel Coward's ``Private Lives.'' She received a
Tony nomination in 1960 when she played a different type of bride in
Tennessee Williams' play, ``Period of Adjustment.''
   Other Broadway credits include ``Whodunnit'' in 1983, ``The Three
Sisters'' in 1964 and ``She Loves Me'' in 1963.
   Her performance as Sally Field's mother in the 1979 film, ``Norma
Rae,'' won Baxley critical praise as did her 1981 performance in the
Wendy Wasserstein play, ``Isn't It Romantic?''
   Her film credits included ``Nashville'' in 1975, ``Countdown'' in
1968, ``No Way to Treat a Lady'' in 1968 and ``All Fall Down'' in
1960.
   She appeared in numerous television programs, including ``Murder,
She Wrote,'' Hawaii Five-O,'' ``Playhouse 90,'' and ``Studio One.''
   She played Isabel in ``Measure for Measure,'' a New York
Shakespeare Festival production in Central Park in 1966 and Portia
in ``The Merchant of Venice'' in the American Shakespeare Festival
in Stratford, Conn., in 1967.
   A native of Stockton, Calif., Baxley won a scholarship to the
Neighborhood Playhouse in New York after graduating from college in
California. In New York, she studied with Sanford Meisner. She also
was a charter member of the Actors Studio, where she studied with
Elia Kazan.
   She had no immediate family.

   A man opened fire into a car in the
parking lot of a psychiatric hospital Thursday, killing his ex-wife
and her boyfriend and wounding his daughter, authorities alleged.
   Police sought Lloyd Christian, 56, who they accused of firing an
undetermined number of shots from a .38-caliber pistol into the car
at the Eastern State Hospital at 3:45 p.m., police said.
   Authorities obtained warrants charging Christian, of Toano, with
two counts of capital murder, said James City County police Capt.
Ken Middlebrook. He remained at large Thursday night.
   Middlebrook said Christian killed his ex-wife, Maxine Bartlett,
of Toano, and Van Overby, 54, of York County, who apparently was Ms.
Bartlett's boyfriend. He said Christian wounded his and Ms.
Bartlett's 12-year-old daughter, Kizzy Christian. Ms. Bartlett's age
was not available.
   Middlebrook alleged that Christian fired several rounds into the
car, striking both Ms. Bartlett and Overby in the head and chest and
Miss Christian in the hand.
   The girl was treated for a flesh wound to the right hand and
released to relatives, said Dr. James Hess at the Williamsburg
Community Hospital.
   Jennifer Fidura, deputy commissioner for the state Department of
Health and Mental Retardation, said Ms. Bartlett had been dropping
Overby off for his housekeeping job at the Eastern State Hospital.
   No patients were involved.

   A federal judge gave the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors a 20-day deadline Thursday to submit a plan for
remapping districts to provide Hispanics with representation and
erase ballot box discrimination.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, whose ruling Monday in a voting
rights suit could affect November elections, declared, ``I do
believe time is important here.''
   He warned that if the supervisors fail to meet his deadline, he
will ``do whatever is necessary'' to devise a redistricting plan.
   Kenyon suggested that the supervisors hold more than their
regular meetings to draft a proposal to be presented to him on June
27.
   ``I want to make it clear,'' said Kenyon, ``this is a deadline.
After that the court will feel free to do whatever is necessary to
come up with a plan.''
   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who attended the federal court
hearing, told reporters he thought 20 days was insufficient time in
which to hold public hearings on the issue. Antonovich is one of the
board's conservative majority which voted to appeal Kenyon's
decision mandating new districts.
   Attorney Marc Rosenbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union,
which joined the U.S. Justice Department lawsuit on the matter, said
hearings could be held immediately.
   On Monday, the day before a statewide election, Kenyon issued a
long awaited ruling in the voting rights lawsuit.
   He found that board members conspired to ``protect their
incumbencies and that of their allies'' when they redrew the
county's five voting districts in 1981.
   The lawsuit, filed in August 1988, charged the supervisors
deliberately spread the county's Hispanic population across several
districts when they changed voting boundaries following the 1980
federal census.
   Hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the county's 8.7
million people. But no Hispanic has been elected to the board since
1875.
   Liberal supervisors have called for a settlement which would
increase the number of districts and supervisors to offer more
representation.

   Congress and the Pentagon are ending months of
haggling with an informal agreement to save tens of thousands of
military jobs by shifting money from major weapons programs,
including land-based missiles.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
late Thursday decided to give the Pentagon the authority to transfer
about $1.5 billion from weapons programs to payroll accounts.
   The money will allow the Defense Department to avoid dismissing
thousands of men and women by October. The funds also will make up
for a financial shortfall in the health insurance plan for military
dependents, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed
Services.
   Among the reductions are $8 million from the MX rail-garrison
missile program, $10 million from the Midgetman missile, $20 million
from the Trident missile submarine and $20 million from the Seawolf
attack submarine.

   A former Army sergeant responsible for
safeguarding sensitive documents was arrested on charges he
conspired to sell information on the nuclear defense of Europe to
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the FBI said.
   ``This represents a hemorrhage of extremely sensitive information
which caused grave danger to the United States and its NATO
allies,'' FBI agent Allen McCreight said. ``We think it has major
implications.''
   Roderick James Ramsay, 28, was arrested without incident Thursday
night and was being held at an undisclosed location. He was
scheduled to appear today before a federal magistrate.
   Ramsay worked in West Germany from 1983 to 1985 directly under
Clyde Lee Conrad, 43, a retired U.S. Army sergeant convicted of
treason by a West German court and given a life sentence earlier
this week, the FBI said. It said Ramsay's arrest stemmed from the

   Czechoslovakia holds its first free
elections in 44 years today following a campaign marred by a bitter
last-minute dispute between the two leading non-Communist parties.
   Some 11.2 million people aged 18 and over are entitled to vote
when polls open at 2 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) for the first round of
voting. Balloting resumes Saturday.
   The voters will choose 300 deputies to a new federal parliament
charged with choosing a new president _ almost certain to be

   America's mightiest unmanned space
rocket, a Titan 4, blasted off today with a secret military payload.
   It was the second launch of a Titan 4. The giant rocket boosted a
missile-warning satellite into orbit in June 1989.
   The rocket was launched at 1:22 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station, lighting up the sky as it thundered toward orbit.
   The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight
until about 20 minutes later, when a statement was issued. The
payload was not disclosed.

   In a union dubbed ``Cuomolot,'' two rising
stars from prominent political families will wed this weekend.
   Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and
Andrew Cuomo, oldest son of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, will be the
bride and groom Saturday in a major social event for the political
world.
   ``Everybody in the world knows the Kennedy family,'' said William
Cunningham, a veteran Cuomo political adviser. ``And the Cuomos _ in
New York state, in the political world _ are at the top of the
heap.''
   But Cunningham cautioned against blowing the wedding's importance
out of proportion.
   ``This isn't the Middle Ages where the Duke of Normandy and the
Duke of Avignon get together and decide on a marriage,'' he said.
``This is not a dynastic accomplishment, this is two people who
decided to get married.''

   For Rosario Murillo, former President
Daniel Ortega's companion of many years, the outcome of February's
elections meant liberation as well as loss.
   ``There's no doubt I'm happier now,'' she said in an interview.
``I had a series of responsibilities that didn't let me do art.''
   Murillo, a poet and singer, headed cultural institutions during
nearly 11 years of Sandinista rule. She has not left political life,
but moved out of her office into the street to revive stagnant party
spirit and bolster wavering militants.
   ``It could be that we bureaucratized ourselves too much in power;
that's the natural tendency,'' Murillo said after leading protesters
at the Supreme Court in a medley of sometimes nostalgic
revolutionary songs.
   ``Artists didn't perform in the street'' while the Sandinistas
governed ``because the rules made it too hard,'' she said. ``You had
to talk to 50 bureaucrats to get permission to do one performance.''
   She said Sandinista singers, artists and writers will have a
chance to put political content back into their work. Even
Sandinista artists had been ``just wanted for entertainment,'' she
told the interviewer.
   Murillo has found a new vocation in leading protests of President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's government.
   They are small compared to past Sandinista crowds. Only 1,200
people, most of them employees of the government telephone company,
appeared at the Supreme Court on May 22 to demand that it overturn a
new civil service law.
   In the past month, Murillo has spoken almost daily to workers,
students and artists. On May 25, she protested a government plan to
reopen a public street that passes through a Sandinista compound
where she and Ortega live.
   The Sandinistas, experts in symbolic battle, said the
government's desire to tear down the brick wall blocking the street
symbolized efforts to destroy everything the Sandinistas had built,
including free health care, public education and land reform.
   ``It's also an attack on the security of the party,'' said Aldo
Cajina, a Sandinista party worker who rushed to the compound to
support Murillo. The government has backed off, at least temporarily.
   Sandinista lyrics sometimes have an ironic ring since Mrs.
Chamorro's victory. They say ``We will win,'' ``The people, united,
will never be defeated,'' ``It's not enough to pray; there's lot's
to be done to achieve peace.''
   Demobilization of U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas is going
slowly, Murillo says, and claims the Chamarro government is
threatening ``to re-establish the power of the rich over the poor.''
   The InterContinental Hotel is ``full of fat businessmen from
Miami'' who lived in exile while the Sandinistas ruled, she said.
   ``This government is starting to look like Somoza's,'' she
declared, using what has become a standard Sandinista phrase
likening Mrs. Chamorro's government to that of President Anastasio
Somoza, whom the Sandinistas overthrew in July 1979.
   Murillo _ hair cut in a short punk style, dressed in tight yellow
pants and a Hawaiian-style flowered shirt _ said she worried about
the new government's cultural conservatism.
   ``We're returning to a troglodyte epoch,'' she said, using
another party expression for the attempt by some Chamorro officials
to forbid miniskirts in government offices.
   Like most party militants, Murillo puts the best face on the
Sandinista election loss. The people will realize their error, she
said, and return the prty to power in six years, if not sooner.
   In the meantime, the demonstrations she leads contribute to the
party's effort to renew its identity and hold wavering militants to
the faith.
   ``It's a great opportunity that Nicaragua has,'' she said. ``It's
unique. There's more passion now; here the revolution is being
reborn.''
   Not all of her concerts are so overtly political as the singing
outside the Supreme Court, she said, but the demonstration needed
``a very concrete message.''
   ``They didn't come out to hear Chopin,'' she observed.
   She has not forgotten the grim dawn of Feb. 26, when she was part
of one of the most riveting tableaus in Nicaraguan history. Her arms
crossed, face raw with tears, she stood behind Ortega as he conceded
that the voters had rejected Sandinismo.
   Murillo said she was happier not having to hold herself in check,
to think about her relationship with Ortega every time she wanted to
participate in something.
   ``People always saw me as someone's shadow,'' she said. ``I had
to be careful because I didn't know how it would affect his image.
It was an impossible self-censorship.''

<TEXT>
   One Sunday morning, President
Fernando Collor de Mello climbed into an F-5B fighter beside a
Brazilian air force pilot for an hour of aerial acrobatics.
   He pulled out a camera during the flight and took his own
picture. Next day, the photo was on front pages across the country.
   It was a stunt typical of Collor, whose vigorous, media-conscious
style has charmed many Brazilians and irritated others since his
inauguration in March.
   At 40, he is Brazil's youngest president. He is the first since
1960 to be chosen by popular vote.
   Collor arrived like a whirlwind in Brasilia, a placid inland
capital run for a generation by generals and bureaucrats.
   Brazilians have watched him soar through the air in an
ultralight, race along back roads on a black motorcycle, zip over
water on a jet-ski and glide beneath it in a submarine. He has
bicycled, kayaked, jogged, swum and worked at karate, soccer and
volleyball.
   A note from President Bush to a former ambassador, published in
Rio newspapers, referred to the Brazilian leader as ``Indiana
Collor.''
   When the president recently announced plans to go skydiving, his
mother thought it was too much.
   ``Everyone, please, write him letters; ask him to stop,'' Leda
Collor de Mello said in an interview on government radio. ``I'm as
worried as you are.''
   Her son changed his mind and ruled out skydiving.
   Last week, a gasoline-soaked pile of illicit cocaine and
marijuana exploded in flames when he dropped a torch on it. He
covered his face and retreated, suffering a singed right ear, hair
and forearm.
   Critics say the ``media events'' reflect a shallow populism aimed
at the poor millions who are Collor's chief supporters.
   ``Collor governs by creating spectacular events,'' Rep. Jose
Genoino, of the leftist Workers Party, said in an interview. ``He
presents the image of a strong president in contrast to a weak
society.''
   Jair Meneguelli, president of the 12 million-member Central
Workers Union, which supported leftist candidate Luis Inacio Lula da
Silva in the December election, described the presidential outings
as ``a stupid recourse to call attention to himself.''
   Collor, a black belt in karate, wrote in an article for Veja,
Brazil's largest newsweekly: ``I've always had a passion for sports.
Today I'm in a position where I have to set an example.''
   A similar style has been evident throughout his political career.
   When campaigning for local office in his poor home state of
Alagoas in northeastern Brazil, where political assassination is not
uncommon, Collor would beat his chest at rallies and defy the hired
``pistoleiros'' of his adversaries to shoot him.
   At the presidential inauguration in March, he dismissed his
driver and made the 5-minute trip from the presidential palace to
Congress on foot. He strode down the Esplandade of Ministries with
Cabinet members struggling to keep pace.
   Every Friday, he crosses the street in front of the presidential
palace to mingle with well-wishers, much to the discontent of his
secret service guards. In the crowd, Collor signs autographs, shakes
hands and receives kisses and slaps on the back.
   To make sure stores were obeying a price freeze he imposed, the
president dropped in at a Brasilia supermarket and pushed a shopping
cart through the aisles.
   At the produce section, he stopped and snapped at the startled
manager: ``These potatoes are rotten. Remove them at once!''
   He wrote a check for the $28 worth of food he bought, and gave
the bag to a boy who was begging outside the store.
   All agree Collor is a master of television. His good looks,
elegant suits and measured baritone are perfectly suited to it.
   ``TV is the great instrument of communication in Brazil, where 20
percent of the people are illiterate and only 10 percent have
completed the eighth grade,'' political scientist Helio Jaguaribe
said in an interview.
   Collor froze $115 billion in bank and money market deposits,
changed the currency from cruzados to cruzeiros and invited the
press along when, to encourage savings, he opened an account with
the equivalent of $100.
   ``It's all a show,'' Genoino said. ``It comes from his
authoritarian concept of government _ a charismatic leader with
everything centered on himself.''
   Allegations of authoritarianism increased after Collor introduced
his economic plan by decree March 16 and told legislators not to
``tamper'' with it.
   ``He is a little emperor,'' sa1nd Meneguelli, the labor leader.
``He tried to sit on Congress, and then was forced to back off to
avert an explosion.''
   Some see Collor's style as a throwback to the classic Latin
American caudillo, or populist leader.
   ``Latin America unfortunately swings between caudillos and
dictatorships,'' Genoino said. ``Multiparty politics still doesn't
exist. It's part of our backwardness.''
   Others feel Collor has accurately read a public desire for an
active, decisive president.
   ``He is exercising his authority, but is not authoritarian,''
Jaguaribe said. ``There's a difference. Brazilians like that,
because the previous government showed very little authority.''
   Jose Sarney, Collor's predecessor, was widely seen as weak and
incompetent. His unpopular administration blamed for annual
inflation of 4,000 percent.
   ``A comparison seems inevitable,'' said Claudio Humberto Rosa e
Silva, press spokesman for Collor. ``We have a young, handsome,
athletic, courageous and competent president. ... He replaced one
who was ugly, short, old (and) cowardly.''

<HEAD>We Are Family, Hopes the `Today' Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During last week's NBC affiliates convention,
Deborah Norville faced station officials and said of the ``Today''
cast: ``This is a family. I'm sorry the print press doesn't see it
that way.''
   NBC hopes a more important audience _ viewers _ will see it that
way today as it re-launches ``Today'' with Joe Garagiola, Faith
Daniels and Katie Couric joining Norville, Bryant Gumbel, Willard
Scott and Gene Shalit on the troubled show.
   The network's We Are Family plan puts a lot of hope on the
addition of the gregarious Garagiola, 64, a popular ``Today''
co-host from 1969 to 1973. He'll join Gumbel and Norville as co-host
on Tuesdays through Thursdays.
   (The print press keeps calling them co-hosts. Wrong, NBC recently
has been emphasizing. Gumbel is the show's anchor. Norville and
Garagiola are co-anchors. Oh, the print press has said.)
   Daniels, late of CBS, will be the news anchor, while Couric, who
has a lively wit, will be the show's national correspondent based in
Washington, where one can find far more harrumph than humor.
   Only time will tell, as they say on TV, whether the newcomers and
NBC's image-rebuilding effort makes Nielsen families welcome the
show back to their bosoms, or at least to the people-meters in 4,000
homes.
   As all but the dead know, co-host Jane Pauley left the show in
December after 13 years. She was privately angered by ``Today''
changes that began last summer, but steadfastly has refused to blame
Norville, her successor.
   Since Pauley's exit, the previously top-rated ``Today'' has been
riding the crest of a slump.
   It has trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for 22 weeks, its
year-to-date ratings are 17 percent below those of 1989, and they're
down 17 percent in what some consider a key demographic group _
women aged 18 to 49.
   That means uh-oh time. The ratings drop translates into millions
of dollars in lost advertising revenue for both NBC and its 209
affiliates.
   However, notes Betsy Frank, a senior vice president at Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising in New York, the drop didn't start when Norville
became ``Today'' co-host in January, just five months after she
became its news anchor.
   The show's ratings were ``trending down even before the
`cataclysmic' Norville-Pauley change,'' she says.
   That's why NBC officials began tinkering with ``Today'' in the
first place _ to get the ratings back up. Alas, they foaled only a
public relations nightmare and failure.
   In Round Two of tinkering, the hiring of old pro Garagiola came
as a surprise, particularly to those expecting NBC to commit
thirtysomething video voodoo to win back those younger,
demographically desirable female viewers.
   But the bald, affable former major league catcher probably will
do that, says Tom Capra, a ``Today'' rookie. He became the show's
executive producer in January.
   ``I think he's kind of an Everyman,'' Capra says. ``Everyone
likes Joe _ younger women, old men, everybody. He's just kind of a
universal figure.''
   Capra tends to scoff at those who write of the women 18-to-49 age
group as if that group were to morning ratings what oxygen is to
life its ownself.
   He'd like to have that audience watching ``Today,'' he says, but
it ``is not gigantic in the morning on any show.'' And, he says,
``Our show, as are all the other morning shows, is sold on the basis
of households as well as demographics.''
   ``We also think that our core `Today' audience is still loyal to
us,'' Capra says, ``and just isn't watching us as often as they used
to. So we believe that the addition of Joe will cause them to come
home.''
   Frank says NBC, in seeking the top ``Today'' ratings of
yesteryear, is hoping to ``recapture some of that warmth and family
appeal'' the show once had.
   ``Garagiola seems to be a pretty good choice,'' she says. ``But
my question is ... whether people, for whatever reason, have not
gotten into the `Good Morning America' habit. And whether the
addition of Joe is enough to bring `Today' back.''

<DATELINE>PERQUIN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War and rain have made a rusty steel
cable 50 feet above a swollen river the umbilical cord between half
of Morazan province and the rest of El Salvador.
   Isolation that has come with every rainy season since 1983, when
guerrillas blew up the bridge, makes a hard life harder for the
50,000 people north of the Torola River.
   They are virtually cut off from May to October, when the river is
too deep for even trucks to ford.
   The people of this town nestled among mist-shrouded hills pray
for the war to end.
   Salt, cooking oil, sugar _ almost everything except the corn,
beans and coffee they grow _ must be hauled along the cable in a
precarious iron gondola. The gondola also is the only transport for
a mother and sick child who must reach the provincial capital, San
Francisco Gotera.
   The region, along with the northern half of Chalatenango province
to the west, is the zone hit hardest by a 10-year-old civil war that
has brutalized this small Central American country.
   Rebels destroyed the bridge to hamper the movement of army
troops. Soldiers have entered the area by helicopter since.
   Perquin is a guerrilla bastion 75 miles northeast of San
Salvador. Most of the 600 residents seem to support the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, whose fighters can be found on
street corners, talking with townsfolk.
   On the last Sunday in May, about 400 rebels mustered in the main
square to hear a speech from the top guerrilla field commander.
   With scores of villagers looking on, several dozen fighters
received shoulder patches distinguishing them for valor during and
since the big rebel offensive in November.
   The people of this town nestled among mist-shrouded hills pray
for the war to end. Strict limits are imposed on the amount of food
each family may take north from the provincial capital each month.
   Medicine, boots, adult clothing and flashlight batteries _ there
is no electricity north of the Torola _ are considered war materiel
and are confiscated at roadblocks.
   Some kinds of fertilizer are banned because they can be used to
make explosives.
   ``I've grown tired of arguing with them,'' said Juan Jose
Rodriguez, a farmer riding in the back of a truck from Perquin to
the river. ``They refuse to accept the obvious truth that we who are
not guerrillas also need shoes and clothing and batteries.''
   Because they have suffered in greater measure, the people of
Perquin want peace perhaps even more than the rest of their 5
million countrymen.
   ``We can't take anymore,'' said Modesto Diaz, a 61-year-old
farmer. ``Peace would be the best thing, but it is not a simple
matter of laying down the guns. There have to be changes and accords
first.''
   Diaz said the army killed his brother and a nephew in 1983.
   ``Someone incorrectly reported them as guerrillas, so the
soldiers came and killed them,'' he said. ``They didn't bother to
investigate.''
   Trinidad Ramos has spent all his 75 years in and around Perquin,
cultivating corn and beans.
   His callused feet and gnarled, almost nailless toes were shod in
thick-soled sandals and he sat on a porch, observing life through
horn-rimmed glasses mended at one hinge with green string.
   ``If it hadn't been for the idiocy of the war, this town would
have prospered,'' he said. ``God willing, it will end soon.''
   Government and rebel representatives met for five days in May in
Caracas, Venezuela, to set an agenda for concluding the war. The
U.N.-sponsored talks are the most promising in six years, but great
differences must be resolved.
   Townspeople in the square nodded as Commander Jorge Melendez
declared: ``Our society is captive to the military. Our democracy is
captive to militarism.''
   The rebels demand ``demilitarization,'' beginning with a purge of
human rights abusers from army ranks and a steady reduction of troop
strength. They say the goal should be abolition of the armed forces
in ``the midterm'' _ perhaps within five years _ leaving a
civilian-run police force to keep order.
   President Alfredo Cristiani'a rightist government has
acknowledged that, when the war is over, El Salvador will not need
such a large army.
   Government spokesmen decline specific comment, citing the
agreement of the two sides on strict confidentiality.
   Officials have said in private, however, that the 56,000-member
security forces could be reduced by about 60 percent after a peace
agreement took effect.

<TEXT>
   The 1990 elections may not greatly increase the
number of women in governor's mansions and Congress, but female
candidates hope to smash a symbolic barrier by winning the top jobs
in Texas and California.
   Democratic governor nominees Ann Richards in Texas and Dianne
Feinstein in California are the bright spots in a year that, at
best, may bring incremental progress in electing more women to
top-level offices.
   Three women already are governors of smaller states, but claiming
control in major states like Texas and California would ``break a
big thick glass ceiling,'' said Sharon Rodine, president of the
bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus.
   While numerical gains at the top are likely to be slim, more
women than ever are running for state legislatures, statewide
offices and Congress, according to the caucus. These candidates are
receiving tens of thousands of dollars from a growing number of
groups promoting women's candidacies.
   But all eyes and a good deal of money are on California and
Texas, where the new governors will have a strong hand in the
redistricting expected to add up to 10 new seats to their
congressional delegations next year.
   ``California and Texas are key in terms of presidential politics
and reapportionment,'' said Jane Danowitz, executive director of the
bipartisan Women's Campaign Fund. ``These are not local posts. We
are talking about chief executive officers for two of the largest
entities in the country.''
   The practical, powerbroker aspects of Feinstein and Richards
victories would be matched by their symbolic import, many women say.
   ``Until we crack the stereotypical barrier of women as executives
of major states, we will not have a woman in the White House,'' said
Wendy Sherman, executive director of the Democratic EMILY's List,
which supports women candidates.
   Feinstein faces Sen. Pete Wilson in November and Richards is up
against oilman-rancher Clayton Williams. Both women survived
bruising primaries and are considered viable contenders.
   ``Those women have been through tough, ugly primaries and shown
they've got what it takes to hold those offices,'' Rodine said.
``Both of them are hungry for the job.''
   Two women governors are retiring this year _ Democrats Madeleine
Kunin of Vermont and Rose Mofford of Arizona. There are 11 others
running for governor, including Republican Kay Orr who is up for
re-election in Nebraska.
   In addition to Feinstein and Richards, Democrat Barbara Roberts
in Oregon is considered a strong contender for an open seat.
Republican Arliss Sturgulewski of Alaska will be in the same
category if she wins her Aug. 28 primary.
   Republican Barbara Hafer of Pennsylvania won her primary but has
an uphill fight against popular Democratic Gov. Bob Casey. The other
governor candidates, all facing primaries, are Republican Marlene
Woodson-Howard of Florida, Democrat Joan Finney of Kansas, Democrat
Evelyn Murphy of Massachusetts and Republicans Mary Mead and Nyla
Murphy, who will face off in Wyoming's GOP primary.
   Seven women are running for the Senate, which now counts two
women among its 100 members. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., is up for
re-election, and Sen. Barbara Mukulski, D-Md., comes up for
re-election in 1992.
   The one Democratic woman making a Senate bid this year, Josie
Heath of Colorado, is expected to win her party nomination but faces
a formidable opponent in GOP Rep. Hank Brown.
   Three GOP women are quitting the House to run for Senate: Reps.
Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island, Lynn Martin of Illinois and Pat
Saiki of Hawaii. Saiki is given the best shot at winning; her
Democratic competitor is Daniel Akaka, who recently was elevated
from the House to the Senate upon the death of Democratic Sen. Spark
Matsunaga.
   Schneider and Martin are putting a scare into two entrenched
Democrats, Claiborne Pell and Paul Simon.
   Longshot Senate candidates are M. Jane Brady, a Republican
challenging Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Republican Christine Todd
Whitman, taking on Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   There are 28 women in the 435-member House, including three
certain departures by those running for the Senate. There also is
speculation that Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., whose daughter is very
ill, may retire this year.
   In addition, a few incumbent women in the House could be
vulnerable, among them Democrats Jill Long of Indiana and Jolene
Unsoeld of Washington.
   On the plus side of the ledger, California Democrat Maxine Waters
is a shoo-in to win the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic
Rep. Augustus Hawkins. There are a number of strong candidates among
the more than 50 women running for Congress, and analysts are
predicting a net gain of up to four seats.
   The most encouraging sign to Rodine is the crowd of women running
for statewide and state legislative offices that traditionally are
jumping-off points for governor and congressional races. For
example, four women besides Feinstein won nominations last week for
statewide office in California.
   Many women are looking to 1992 as a watershed year that could
break the pattern of incremental gains at the federal level.
   Redistricting will open up new opportunities for women in states
gaining House seats, and a large crop of incumbents is expected to
retire because it will be the last year legislators can take their
campaign war chests with them.
   The caucus, the campaign fund, EMILY's List and the National

   ConAgra Inc. has agreed to buy Beatrice Co.
for $1.34 billion in cash and stock, the two food companies said.
   The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought Beatrice
in a $6.1 billion leveraged buyout in 1986, when the company was a
huge food and consumer products conglomerate.
   Since then, Beatrice has sold off most of its businesses but
still retains a number of brands including Hunt's, Wesson, Manwich,
Peter Pan, Swiss Miss and La Choy. The deal announced Thursday
completes KKR's divestiture.

the company said.
   Iacocca's decision, announced Thursday, follows last week's
announcement that company Vice President Gerald Greenwald had quit
to lead a three-union bid to buy United Airlines for $4.54 billion.
   Greenwald had been Iacocca's hand-picked successor. A year ago,
he had told Greenwald that the chairmanship ``was yours to lose.''

   Sales in May were sluggish for many of the nation's big
retailers, who blamed unseasonable weather for discouraging shoppers.
   Retail industry analysts said abnormally cool temperatures and
heavy rainfall, particularly in the Midwest and East, restrained
customers in buying summer clothing and other seasonal merchandise,
such as air conditioners, lawn mowers or outdoor furniture.
   Analysts expected business to accelerate later in the year, when
the bulk of retailers' sales and profits occur.

   Americans took out only $584 million more in

   The Federal Reserve said Thursday consumer credit increased at a

percent growth rate the previous month.
   Spending on services generally continues to be brisk, but
expenditures for big-ticket goods that are bought with loans have

<HEAD>Good News for Consumers: Sluggish May Sales Could Bring More
Markdowns</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

   Weak retail sales growth last month may have left stores with so
much extra inventory that they will have to slash prices to clear
out summer merchandise.
   ``It will be good for the consumer,'' said retail analyst Monroe
Greenstein of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Many of the nation's big general merchandisers, discounters,
specialty and department stores posted disappointingly modest May
sales gains on Thursday. Retail executives said unseasonable weather
discouraged shoppers.
   Abnormally cool temperatures and heavy rainfall, particularly in
the Midwest and East, kept customers from buying summer clothing and
other seasonal merchandise such as air conditioners, lawn mowers or
outdoor furniture, several analysts said.
   But Greenstein disputed the importance of the weather.
   ``The poor weather may have played a role but I do not think it
was the dominant factor,'' Greenstein said.
   Sales of apparel, which have been the mainstay for retailers for
more than a year, lost momentum. The slowing trend began in late
April, Greenstein said.
   ``It is the first sign of a slowdown for the industry,'' he said,
adding that it indicates consumers have become more cautious about
spending.
   He said markdown activity is starting earlier than usual this
season and price cuts may end up being deeper than retailers
originally planned.
   Retailers typically start lowering price tags in mid-June in an
effort to empty their stores in preparation for shipments of
back-to-school and fall merchandise.
   Several retailing executives acknowledged their May sales fell
short of projections.
   But K mart Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph E. Antonini
said the discounter's results were decent considering how much
business was lost to bad weather.
   The Troy, Mich.-based nationwide chain posted a 10.4 percent May
sales increase at all of its stores. Excluding stores opened within
the past year, however, K mart's sales were up a weaker 0.9 percent
from a year earlier.
   Analysts consider results from stores open at least a year,
called same- or comparable-store sales, to be the best barometer of
a retailer's performance.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. also posted a meager 0.9 percent gain in
its same-store sales. The Chicago-based giant said total sales for
the four weeks ended June 3 also edged up 0.9 percent from last year.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. outperformed its competitors, as usual.
Analysts say Wal-Mart could overtake its bigger rivals in terms of
national sales volume as soon as this year. K mart currently is
ranked second after Sears.
   Wal-Mart, headquartered in Bentonville, Ark., said its May sales
jumped 24 percent from the year earlier level. And when measured on
a comparable-store basis, sales still managed a double-digit gain,
rising 11 percent.
   Some retailers had mixed news: good sales growth in an individual
division or two but poor results in another. Such was the case for
Dayton Hudson Corp., a Minneapolis-based retailer that operates the
Target discount chain, Mervyn's and department stores.
   Chairman Kenneth A. Macke said business at Target and Mervyn's
held up well while the company's department stores had a decline in
same-store sales.
   ``We would be happy to have a good warm spell to increase sales
of swim suits and other warm weather items,'' Macke said.
   Dayton Hudson posted a 7.9 percent increase in the four weeks
ended June 2 from a year before. Sales at stores open at least a
year rose 4.2 percent.
   The retailers' results differ from the monthly retail sales
report issued by the Commerce Department. The government's report is
more comprehensive and includes sales at auto dealerships and other
retail establishments. The government focuses on month-to-month
changes while the retailers measure their performance against the
previous year's pace.
   Other retailers reporting Thursday included:
   _Woolworth Corp. said total domestic sales in the four weeks to
June 2 rose 6.1 percent from last year and same-store sales grew 3
percent.
   Among department store operators:
   _May Department Stores Co. reported a 9 percent sales increase
for the four weeks. Same-store sales for the St. Louis-based
retailer rose 4 percent.
   _J.C. Penney Co. Inc. of Dallas posted a 2.3 percent increase
overall and a 1 percent rise in same-store sales.
   Among specialty apparel retailers:
   _The Limited Inc. said total four-week sales rose 16 percent;
comparable-store sales increased 6 percent for the Columbus,
Ohio-based chain.

<HEAD>Iacocca's Sticking Around</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Iacocca will stay in the driver's seat at
Chrysler Corp. after his contract expires next year, but the
question of his eventual successor will continue to loom large over
the nation's No. 3 automaker.
   The line to the chairman's office was disrupted last week when
Iacocca's heir apparent, Gerald Greenwald, resigned as vice chairman.
   The succession issue has heated up at a time when Chrysler's
sales and earnings are under the most pressure since the company
came back from the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago.
   ``Right now, there's a battle raging and I'm not going to leave
my troops in the field,'' Iacocca said in a statement released
Thursday after a Chrysler board meeting in New York. ``We have
mutually agreed that my employment will be extended past December of
1991.''
   Just how long the 65-year-old Iacocca will continue as chairman
and chief executive officer and how much he will be paid isn't
known, Chrysler spokesman A.C. Liebler said.
   ``Iacocca is probably the single most important element ot
Chrysler Corporation,'' said Alan Helfman, general manager of River
Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in Houston. ``He sells the sizzle and people
like the showmanship.''
   That will be a tough act to follow, Helfman said.
   ``One of my prime responsibilities is to put an orderly
succession plan in place,'' Iacocca said. ``We're going to do that
according to our own timetable and it won't be driven by a big X on
the calendar.''
   Greenwald was told by Iacocca about a year ago that Chrysler's
chairmanship was ``yours to lose.'' Greenwald chose to lose it,
opting instead to head a three-union effort to buy the parent of
United Airlines for $4.54 billion.
   Analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. said
Iacocca probably would stay at the helm for no more than two extra
years as a stopgap.
   ``I tend to think it (the extension) is to give the board time
and the contenders the opportunity to establish their own track
records,'' she said.
   Less than 24 hours after Greenwald's resignation, Chrysler said
Robert S. Miller, the company's chief financial officer, would take
over Greenwald's title and most of his duties. Chrysler Motors
President Robert Lutz got the rest of the duties, but no new title.
   The changes prompted speculation that Iacocca might stay on after
his contract expires Dec. 8, 1991. Neither Miller, 48, nor Lutz, 58,
appeared ready to become chairman in 18 months.
   Greenwald was the highest ranking of three executives who
announced their resignations in May. Michael Hammes resigned as vice
president for international operations to head up hand tool
operations at Black &amp; Decker and Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman said
he will quit sometime this summer.
   Chrysler has been thinning its executive ranks since last
October, when it started a $1.5 billion cost-cutting program that
will reduce the white-collar work force by more than 2,500 people.
   The company reported an 80 percent drop in first-quarter earnings
to $71 million. Analysts don't expect an upturn until at least the
fourth quarter.
   Earnings have been pressured by a dive in the company's car and
truck sales. Through the first five months of this year, sales were
running nearly 13 percent below last year's pace.
   Iacocca signed a four-year contract with the automaker in 1987.
He joined Chrysler in 1979 after being fired as president of Ford
Motor Co. by the late Henry Ford II.
   Iacocca's most lucrative year as chairman was in 1986 when he
received $20.5 million in compensation. His average annual
compensation since 1985 was $11.5 million. He received $4 million
for last year.
   The company's 1990 proxy statement says Iacocca will receive
191,250 shares of Chrysler stock this coming Nov. 2 and another
63,750 shares after Dec. 8, 1991.
   At $16 a share, Chrysler's common stock price at midday Thursday,
the stock would have a combined value of $4.1 million.

<HEAD>Government Boosted Spending To Fight Dollar Rise In Feb.-April
Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government spent $1.58 billion trying to hold
down the dollar's rise against the Japanese yen from February
through April, the Federal Reserve reported.
   Still, the dollar increased 10 percent against the yen during the
period, the Fed said in its quarterly report to Congress. The rise
began to subside only when currency traders started to believe
Japanese interest rates did not need to climb further and when
Japan's stock and bond markets became more settled, the Fed said.
   The government used $200 million to buy West German marks to
bring its total currency market intervention for the period to $1.78
billion. The dollar declined less than 0.5 percent against the mark
in the three months.
   In the previous three months, the government spent $750 million
intervening in currency markets, all of it to buy yen.
   Although purchases more than doubled in the latest quarter, it
was ``far, far lower'' than pervious periods last year, said Sam Y.
Cross, a Fed executive vice president who released the report at a
press conference.
   The government spent a record $11.92 billion in the foreign
exchange market during the three months ended July 31 and $5.871
billion in August-October period. The government purchased both yen
and West German marks during those periods.
   In the latest period, the dollar saw its steepest climb against
the yen from late February through early April. The climb subsided
as the market awaited the April 7 meeting of finanical officials
from governments of the world's seven leading industrial nations,
the Fed said.
   Also, in April, market participants came to view the Bank of
Japan's 1 percent increase in the discount rate as being sufficient
to stop the yen's slide, and Japan's stock and bond markets began to
recoup some of their losses, according to the report.
   The yen's weakness against the dollar helped trigger a slide of
more than 25 percent on the Tokyo stock market early this year.
   The dollar was at its low of the period on Feb. 19 at 143.6 yen.
But the dollar began to rally after election victories for Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party and predictions of higher interest rates
elsewhere in the world. The government sold $650 million to buy yen
between Feb. 23 and March 2.
   Also, the dollar strengthened against the mark amid fears of
inflation resulting from the pending currency union between East and
West Germany. The dollar reached 1.7237 marks on March 1.
   Between March 5 and March 27, the Treasury sold $830 million to
buy yen and $200 million was sold for marks. The purchases were made
by the U.S. Treasury as the Fed temporarily put its intervention
program on hold. The Fed and Treasury normally split the funds used
for intervention.
   The temporary halt came after some Fed officials said they were
concerned that high amounts of purchases like those in 1989 could
cause doubts about the Fed's commitment to curbing inflation,
according to the report. The government's currency intervention
exacerbate inflation by increase the supply of dollars.

<TEXT>
   The story of Beatrice Co. resembles the rise and
fall of an empire: The conglomerate was built up slowly, bit by bit,
then dismantled in much the same manner. And the spoils of war made
great fortunes along the way.
   The last piece of the company disappeared Thursday as ConAgra
Inc. bought Beatrice's remaining food operations for $1.34 billion.
   It was the endgame of a decade of corporate Pac-man.
   The sale also marked the last chapter in the $6.1 billion
leveraged buyout of Beatrice engineered by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. and businessman Donald Kelly, who went on to serve as Beatrice's
chairman.
   After acquiring the conglomerate in 1985, Kelly and Kohlberg
Kravis began systematically stripping away its assets _ at a
handsome profit for themselves and other investors.
   Back in the early 1980s, Beatrice was a food and consumer
products company with several big brands in its portfolio, including
La Choy oriental foods, Samsonite luggage, Tropicana orange juice
and STP auto products.
   Led by then-chairman James L. Dutt, the company had grown big
through acquisitions. But the nature of its businesses _
high-profile consumer brands that generated lots of cash _ left it
vulnerable to a breakup.
   In 1984, Beatrice set its sights on Esmark Inc., the acquisition
that proved its undoing.
   Esmark had started out in business as Swift &amp; Co., the
meatpacker. But Esmark was also acquisition-minded, and in 1983 it
had paid $973 million for Norton Simon Inc., another conglomerate.
   The purchase of Norton Simon gave Esmark such well-known brands
as Hunt-Wesson foods, Max Factor cosmetics, Playtex underwear, Swift
and Eckrich meats and the Avis car rental company.
   In May 1984, 10 months after buying Norton Simon, Kohlberg Kravis
and Kelly _ then chairman of Esmark _ offered to take the company
private for $2.4 billion. Dutt topped the bid and Beatrice won the
firm for $2.7 billion.
   To pay for Esmark, Beatrice began to pare assets, saying it would
sell Avis; Danskin clothing; International Jensen electronics
equipment; and its cookie, food service equipment, agri-products and
leather businesses.
   But Beatrice proved unable to handle the financial and corporate
burdens of the acquisition. It led to management turmoil and a drop
in profits, and eventually to the ouster of Dutt in August 1985.
   Two months later Kohlberg Kravis reappeared, again with the
support of Kelly, who had quit Esmark after its buyout. They
swallowed Beatrice for $6.1 billion.
   The breakup of Beatrice then began in earnest.
   In the late 1980s under Kelly's leadership, Beatrice sold off
some $7 billion in assets. Several were then turned around and sold
once again.
   Among them:
   _Avis was sold to its senior management and the investor group
Wesray Capital Corp. for $1.6 billion in 1986. A year later, Wesray
sold the car rental firm to its employees for $1.75 billion.
   _The company's Coca-Cola bottling businesses were sold to the
Coca-Cola Co. for $1 billion in 1986. The businesses were combined
with Coke's other bottling operations under a separate company,
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., and 51 percent of the firm was spun off
to the public.
   _The Playtex consumer products and apparel businesses went
private in 1986 in a management-led LBO for $1.25 billion. Playtex
later sold its family products division to Johnson &amp; Johnson Co. for
$726 million.
   _Beatrice's international operations was bought by TLC Group LP
for $985 million in 1987 and renamed TLC Beatrice International Inc.
The following year, TLC sold the company's Latin American operations
for more than $100 million.
   _Tropicana Products Inc. went for $1.2 billion to Seagram Co.
Ltd. in 1988.
   Kelly also spun off Beatrice's specialty food and non-food
businesses such as Samsonite luggage, Culligan water treatment
systems and Stiffel lamps in a $1.92 billion public stock and debt
offering. The new company, E-II Holdings Inc., was intended to be a
vehicle for more acquisitions by the company.
   E-II lived up to expectations, launching an attack on American
Brands Inc. in December 1987. But American Brands turned the tables
on E-II, and acquired the aggressor for $2.7 billion two months
later.
   With these and other divestitures, there remained Beatrice's core
food business _ brands including Hunt's, Wesson, Manwich, Peter Pan,
Snack Pak, Swiss Miss, La Choy, Swift Premium, Butterball, Eckrich
and Reddi-Wip.
   The food business went on the block in 1987, but when talks with
an unidentified prospective buyer broke down, the company took
itself off the market in early 1988.
   Now, two years later, ConAgra is buying the company.
   The more than four years of divestitures proved very profitable
for investors. Kohlberg Kravis estimated Thursday that equity
investors who put up $420 million to buy Beatrice had reaped a total
of about $2.2 billion, a return of more than 50 percent a year on
their investment.

Richard C. Breeden is taking his message of international
cooperation among stock market regulators on the road again _ to
Luxembourg, Germany and Hungary.
   The head of the federal agency that regulates stocks, bonds and
other securities said Thursday he'll travel to Europe later this
month to sign an international cooperation agreement in Luxembourg
and help reopen the long dormant Budapest Stock Exchange.
   He also said an advisory committee on East European markets,
``representing some of the best and the brightest'' on Wall Street,
will hold its first meeting in Washington next week to discuss ways
of helping the infant free market economies of former Iron Curtain
countries.
   Since taking office last October, Breeden has traveled to Japan,
France and the Netherlands to hammer out cooperation agreements with
foreign securities regulators.
   High-level officials from the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland
have visited SEC headquarters in Washington _ some delegations more
than once.
   ``Together the countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
represent a potential market of 400 million people,'' Breeden said
in a speech to the New York Financial Writers Association. ``Helping
these countries create free economic markets is the right thing to
do,'' he added.
   In addition to helping the Budapest Stock Market celebrate its
reopening June 21 after 42 years in limbo under Communist rule,
Breeden said he expected to sign an assistance agreement with
Hungarian government on securities matters.
   He said the SEC also was working on new agreements with Mexico,
Australia, Israel and several other countries.
   In other matters, Breeden defended proposed legislation to give
the SEC control of stock index futures. He rebutted congressional
criticism that the bill unveiled by the Bush administration earlier
this week is riddled with loopholes that would hinder, rather than
assist, investor protection.
   Breeden also said he believed there was still time in the
dwindling congressional session to get the controversial legislation
enacted.
   Critics have said the proposal to take regulation of stock index
futures away from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and give
it to the SEC would ``open the flood gates'' to deregulated trading
because of vague legislative language.
   The CFTC and the SEC have battled publicly over which agency
should oversee financial products that have elements of both a
security and a futures contract. Such hybrid products include stock
index futures, which allow investors to speculate on movements in
the stock market without having to buy the stocks themselves.
   The administration's plan for ending the turf battle would
``unify regulation under the SEC of the `one market' of stocks,
stock options and stock index futures,'' according to the Treasury
Department.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which oversees the CFTC, said Wednesday the proposal was
``riddled with loopholes and legal inconsistencies'' that could
result in ``massive deregulation.''
   ``I'm not aware of any loopholes,'' Breeden told reporters before
his speech.
   Breeden, who has often complained about the split in regulatory
authority over new financial products, maintained that the proposed
legislation would decrease instability and protect investors from
stock market gyrations.
   Some Washington officials have suggested there may not be enough
time to get such a controversial piece of legislation approved
before Congress adjourns for the year on Oct. 5.
   ``I don't think time is necessarily a problem,'' said Breeden,
adding that the issue already has been thoroughly explored and
debated in numerous committee hearings.

<HEAD>Deal Makes ConAgra One of Largest Food Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc.'s $1.34 billion purchase of
Beatrice Co. closed out one of the key leveraged buyouts of the
1980s at a big profit and established ConAgra as a leading U.S. food
company for the '90s.
   ``This will put ConAgra at roughly $20 billion (in annual
sales),'' said Stephen Carnes, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, in Minneapolis.
   ``It consolidates the food industry even further,'' said John
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   ConAgra would rank as one of the world's biggest food companies
along with Nestle of Switzerland, the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever and
New York-based Philip Morris, McMillin said.
   ConAgra will acquire Beatrice for cash and stock valued at $1.34
billion. The deal announced Thursday will unite some of the
country's best-known food brands on a single corporate shelf.
   ConAgra generated more than $15 billion in sales in the year
ended May 27 by processing grain, selling farm products such as
fertilizer and animal feed, and marketing prepared foods. Its food
brands includes Healthy Choice, Banquet, Armour Classics, Morton,
Chun King and Kid's Cuisine frozen foods; Armour processed meats and
Country Pride chicken products.
   Beatrice had $4.3 billion in sales in its most recent year with
brands such as Hunt's, Wesson, Orville Redenbacher's, Manwich, Peter
Pan, Snack Pak, Swiss Miss, La Choy, Swift Premium, Butterball,
Eckrich and Reddi-Wip.
   ``We believe ConAgra and Beatrice together will be the best food
company in the United States,'' Chairman Charles M. Harper said at a
news conference at ConAgra's Omaha headquarters.
   ``One of ConAgra's most important long-term objectives has been
to establish a strong sales and distribution system to the
shelf-stable section of the grocery store,'' he said, referring to
food products that don't require refrigeration. ``Beatrice will
fulfill that objective.''
   The deal, which is subject to approval by federal regulators, was
announced after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
where ConAgra's stock rose 75 cents to $32 a share.
   The sale completes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s divestiture of
Beatrice, a classic asset-stripping exercise that pocketed huge
profits for the New York buyout firm and its other investors.
   KKR purchased Beatrice _ then a major foods and consumer products
conglomerate _ in a $6.1 billion leveraged buyout in 1986. In
subsequent years Beatrice sold off Avis rent-a-car, a Coca-Cola
bottler, Tropicana Products Inc. and other prominent brands. The
food businesses sold to ConAgra were all that remained.
   Investors who put $420 million of equity into KKR's Beatrice
buyout reaped a total of about $2.2 billion from the selloff of its
businesses, representing a compound annual rate of return of more
than 50 percent, the buyout firm said.
   Under terms of the sale, ConAgra will buy Beatrice for $11.50 a
share from KKR partnerships and management investors. The purchase
price consists of approximately $626 million in cash, $355 million
in ConAgra common stock and $355 million in two series of ConAgra
preferred stock.
   Harper said the acquisition would have no immediate effect on
employment at Beatrice or ConAgra. There also are no plans to move
executives from Beatrice's Chicago office or to phase out the
Beatrice name, he said.
   ``Our whole company is trying to manage them (Beatrice) as
independent operating companies,'' Harper said.
   Consumers will see no immediated changes, he said, but added, ``I
think there will probably be more new products introduced over time
that fit consumers' needs and improve their quality of life.''
   Beatrice reported earnings of $12 million on sales of $4.26
billion in the year ended Feb. 28. ConAgra is expected to report
earnings for its fiscal year ended May 27 later this month.

<HEAD>GM, Soviet Automaker Sign Joint Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 billion deal with the Soviet Union's largest
automaker may pave General Motors Corp.'s way to more lucrative
contracts in that country, Vice President William Hoglund said.
   ``As President Gorbachev said last week and as we have felt for a
very long time, if you ever want to play in that market ... you have
to start someplace,'' Hoglund said at a news conference at GM
headquarters.
   He was referring to the Soviet leader's comment to bankers,
industrialists and manufacturers five days earlier in Minneapolis:
``Those who don't want to risk their dollars will remain observers
for years to come.''
   Under the five-year agreement signed Thursday at Volga Auto Works
in Togliatti, 700 miles east of Moscow, GM will supply Volga with
engine emission-control systems. The first components would be
shipped in 1992 for Volga's Lada cars.
   The contract marks the first automotive deal between a U.S. and
Soviet company since the Great Depression. Ford Motor Co. last year
pulled out of joint venture talks with Soviet companies. Chrysler
Corp. has no dealings in the Soviet Union.
   ``It does provide a very good foundation from which start, to
learn how to do business there, learn how to find hotel rooms and
make telephone calls,'' Hoglund said.
   World automakers have been looking actively for business in
Eastern Europe as a result of recent political and economic changes.
GM already has announced vehicle manufacturing deals in Hungary and
East Germany.
   The technology GM will supply Volga will enable the company to
meet current or expected worldwide emission standards and export
Ladas to pollution-conscious Europe and other markets, Hoglund said.
   GM systems would make Lada engines cleaner-running and more fuel
efficient, Hoglund said, ``and provide massive improvements to
driveability.''
   GM will supply 100,000 to 150,000 engine-control systems a year
to Volga. not a vast number compared with its capability of making
more than 5 million systems a year for the U.S. market, he said.
   GM is to be paid in dollars, assuming Volga can export enough
cars to raise the hard currency. ``This as a proportion of our total
engine-management system business is a reasonably small risk,'' he
said.
   Components GM will supply include engine-control computer
modules, fuel injection systems, ignition parts, wiring and
catalytic converters. The first batches will be made by GM in the
United States and Europe. The components make up the bulk of the $1
billion deal, Hoglund said.
   GM also will do engineering work at its European Technical Center
in Bascharage, Luxembourg, on how the systems are to be adapted to
1.5 liter and 1.7 liter Lada engines, he said. The company also will
train Soviets in the use of the systems, he said.
   GM and Volga said they also will discuss forming a joint venture
to manufacture catalytic converters in the Soviet Union.
   That could give GM a valuable source of the costly platinum and
platinum-based elements used in the converters, materials found
chiefly in the Soviet Union and South Africa, Hoglund said.
   Last February, GM's Allison Gas Turbine Division said it had
signed a deal to supply up to 100 helicopter engines to the Soviet
Union beginning in 1992. That agreement could be worth $50 million
to $100 million during the 1990s, officials have said.

<HEAD>Creditors Reject Drexel Reorganization Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creditors have spurned Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc.'s bankruptcy reorganization proposal and are pursuing
their own plan that would oust the management of the collapsed Wall
Street firm.
   The committee representing Drexel's creditors decided Thursday to
reject Drexel's plan for emerging from Chapter 11 protection.
   The previous day, Drexel proposed to pay creditors 100 cents on
the dollar, in part by giving them a share of the company's holdings
of junk bonds and other illiquid investments, valued by the firm at
about $2 billion.
   Drexel has asked for a 120-day extension of a deadline set for
Wednesday giving it the exclusive right to file a reorganization
plan. But the creditors said they would asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Howard C. Buschman III for permission to file their own plan.
   The company filed for bankruptcy protection in February and its
brokerage subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., followed suit
last week. Drexel plans to emerge from bankruptcy court as an
operating entity, although it is unclear what shape the firm would
take.
   Creditors said they were dissatisfied with Drexel's proposal that
would keep management in control as the company liquidates assets.
They also said a plan to repay creditors of most subsidiaries with
cash and creditors of the parent company with notes backed by
Drexel's assets was unacceptable.
   Drexel management was ``a problem of consequence but certainly
the plan they proposed wasn't in any manner sufficient,'' said
Sylvan Schefler, a former Drexel managing director who is
representing former employees on the committee.
   The creditors' proposal would ``substantively consolidate'' the
parent company and its major subsidiaries and provide for 100
percent recovery to creditors within three years.
   It also would create a new board of directors and new management
for Drexel. The creditors said debt instruments and common and
preferred stock would be created under their plan that could be
traded publicly.
   Under Drexel's proposal, the firm would create a separate
business entity out of its investments. Creditors would receive
promissory notes valued at the amount of their individual claims and
backed by Drexel's assets. The notes would be paid off as Drexel's
assets are liquidated. Drexel's attorneys said the firm would manage
the portfolio.
   The creditors panel said its plan also would ask the bankruptcy
court to estimate the amount of Drexel's liability in more than 400
lawsuits, which seek damages for the firm's trading activity.
   A separate litigation trust would be formed to handle potential
claims against recipients of some $260 million in bonuses Drexel
paid out in the months before it filed for bankruptcy protection,
the committee said.
   Drexel rose to power in the 1980s by dominating the high-yield
bond business but failed to recover from a government securities
fraud investigation. The firm last year pleaded guilty to six
felonies and agreed to pay $650 million to settle insider trading
and other allegations.

   The U.S. dollar gained slightly against the Japanese
yen today, while stock prices fell moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 152.65 yen, up 0.10 yen from
Thursday's close.
   Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar moved
little throughout the day, adding that the market is awaiting a
series of economic data to be released next week by both Japan and
the United States.
   On the stock market, the the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues shed 199.21 points, or 0.60 percent, closing the week at
32,993.29 points. The Nikkei index gained 239 points on Thursday.
   A total of 700 million shares were changed hands on the first
section, up from Thursday's 650 million shares.
   Yozo Asai, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities Co., said
the key index headed lower over active trading of spot issues in
exchange for futures contracts.

   Scientists studying a disease affecting citrus
fruit inadvertently discovered two antibiotics that might be used to
treat staph infection among humans, the Agriculture Department says.
   Staph bacteria became resistant to earlier antibiotics and are
beginning to resist the current method of treatment.
   ``In lab tests, the new potent antibiotics stopped the growth of
staph bacteria,'' said Robert A. Baker, a chemist with USDA's
Agricultural Research Service.
   He and retired colleague James Tatum discovered the compounds
after fermenting the soil-borne fungus Fusarium solani in vats.
   ``We weren't really looking for the antibiotics,'' said Baker.
``We were trying to establish a relationship between the soil fungus
and a citrus disease.''
   He said the antibiotics can be easily isolated from fermentation
broths.
   About 20 percent to 40 percent of all adults intermittently carry
staph bacteria on their skin, in their nose or on their clothes,
said Dr. Mary Young of Georgetown University Medical Center's
division of infectious diseases here.
   If a carrier gets an abrasion or cut, the bacteria can attack not
only the surface skin cells, but also enter the body and cause even
more serious problems, she said.
   ``The staph organism quickly becomes resistant to antibiotics by
producing an enzyme that renders the antibiotic ineffective,'' Young
said.
   Baker said he thinks his discovery can be effective against
staph, but such testing would have to be done by pharmaceutical
companies.

   Farmers who were hard hit by continuing severe
weather and flooding need not lose their price support benefits, the
Agriculture Department says.
   The department announced Thursday that producers who were
prevented from planting a program crop because of weather conditions
will be allowed to withdraw from their contracts with the government
without the assessment of liquidated damages.
   They also will be able to receive prevented-planting credit from
the program crop, John Stevenson, acting executive vice president of
the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   The action follows a letter to Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter from eight senators whose states experienced serious
flooding this spring.
   ``In Missouri alone, only about 50 percent of our corn crop has
been planted and we are more than two weeks behind normal planting
cotton,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who spearheaded the
senators' efforts.
   Other states that suffered severely from planting delays are
Tennessee, Florida, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and
Mississippi.
   ``Giving our farmers the flexibility to plant as weather permits
without jeopardizing their future income form the government
programs will help them through yet another difficult time,'' said
Bond.

   Three new varieties of sweet potatoes with
built-in defenses against insects have been developed by Agriculture
Department scientists.
   Most sweet potatoes have skins that naturally provide some
resistance to insects and nematodes, but few have the level of
resistance of these new varieties, said scientists at the
Charleston, S.C., vegetable lab of USDA's Agricultural Research
Service.
   The new sweet potato varieties are called Regal, Southern Delite
and Excel.
   ``Resistance in Excel amounts to 80 percent control of soil
insects, 75 percent of the sweet potato flea beetle and 92 percent
of the white grub,'' said plant geneticist Alfred Jones. ``That's
control you just cannot achieve with the presently recommended
chemical treatments.''
   Jones said Excel, the newest of the varieties has unsually strong
resistance to seven common soil insect pests in field tests: the
southern potato wireworm, tobacco wireworm, banded cucumber beetle,
spotted cucumber beetle, elongated flea beetle, pale-striped flea
beetle and sweet potato flea beetle.
   On test plots, the new varieties produced more marketable
potatoes without insecticide than did Jewel when it was sprayed
regularly with insecticide, USDA said.

   Universal Studios Florida wants its new $630
million theme park to prove it can compete worldwide with
entertainment giant Walt Disney World. But first there are some bugs
to be worked out.
   Glitches on a glitzy opening day Thursday at the combination film
production center and tourist park closed several of the heavily
publicized rides, including ``Kongfrontation,'' featuring King Kong.
   And long lines formed throughout what Sidney Sheinberg, president
of Universal parent MCA Inc., calls his ``swampland into a
dreamland'' _ the 444-acre rival to Walt Disney Co.'s dominance
among the 13 million annual visitors to central Florida.
   ``I have never been so mad in my entire life,'' said visitor
Denise McDonald of Toronto. ``I'm so ticked off.''
   Because of the difficulties, all patrons today were to receive a
free pass with no expiration date.
   But Sheinberg was optimistic.
   Universal Studios ``is the prototype of the studio and visitor
attraction we hope to build in Europe and the Orient and some day in
other locations around the globe,'' he told opening-day guests.
   MCA's Recreation Services Division will be ``a major segment of
our future, second to none of our other businesses,'' Sheinberg said.
   The $3.38-billion entertainment conglomerate has relied on its
filmed entertainment and music operations for up to three-fourths of
its annual revenue.
   Up to now, Recreation Services primarily has been involved with
MCA's Universal Studio Tour in California and concession operations
for Yosemite National Park, industry observers say.
   Walt Disney Co. operates three Orlando-area theme parks,
including the year-old Disney-MGM Studios.
   Universal Studios Florida is a joint venture of MCA and the Rank
Organization PLC of London. Rank's chairman, Sir Patrick Meaney,
said France and England are enthusiastic about proposals to build a
new theme park in their countries.
   Sheinberg said he hoped to announce a European site within two or
three months. MCA also has indicated interest in building a studio
park in Japan with Nippon Steel.
   But operational problems plagued the much-heralded opening of the
Florida park.
   The six-story tall ``Kongfrontation'' sound stage was closed
because the 6-ton steel-and-fur monster could go through its
computer-activated terror routines only in stages. A program that
melds all the segments into one smooth performance was inoperative,
a company spokesman said.
   A re-creation of a San Francisco earthquake for passengers aboard
a subway train operated only partially. Actor Charlton Heston became
the main attraction at that site.
   He was joined by celebrities Michael J. Fox, Bill Cosby, Linda
Blair, Jimmy Stewart, Ernest Borgnine, Sissy Spacek and dozens of
other stars flown in from Hollywood and New York by chartered plane
and train.
   Robert Wagner, master of ceremonies for the inaugural ceremonies,
directed the sealing of a 25-year time capsule of Universal Studios
memorabilia. Director Steven Spielberg cut a ribbon before visitors
poured in.
   Universal Studios Florida has a capacity of about 40,000, but
officials have said attendance would be held below 20,000, if
necessary, for the first few weeks until a shakedown is completed.
   Universal hopes to attract about 5 million visitors in its first
year. Jay Stein, president of Recreation Services, told reporters
that ``somewhere between 3 or 4 million people would put us in the
black.''

   Private businesses, universities and government
agencies are teaming up to develop an advanced computer network that
would transmit data 700 times faster than currently possible, The
New York Times reported today.
   The project is expected to be announced later today by the
National Science Foundation, based in Washington, D.C.
   The high-speed computer network would enable the transmission of
1 billion bits of computer data per second via fiber-optic cables
currently used for telephone service.
   Government laboratories at Los Alamos, N.M., and Livermore,
Calif., will participate in what would be the first comprehensive
effort in the United States to advance the technologically critical
area of computer networks, the newspaper said.
   Dozens of corporations, including IBM, AT&amp;T, MCI, and the
regional Bell companies, and such universities as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the
California Institute of Technology and the University of California
at Berkeley, will participate, it said.
   The network might be used to link computers and televisions to
allow users to manipulate images on screen and transmit them to
other users within seconds.
   Another use would be three-dimensional medical imaging that would
allow doctors thousands of miles away to simultaneously analyze
lifelike images.
   Weather forecasting would improve because supercomputers
throughout the country would be linked, and business trips could be
eliminated in favor of multimedia teleconferencing.
   Several technological challenges confront the project, such as
the need to develop a new class of computers to keep up with the new
``data highways.''
   The network will be set in motion with a $15 million grant from
the National Science Foundation and the Pentagon, and more than $100
million from the computer and communications companies, The Times
reported.
   Other recent cooperative technological projects have failed
because of lack of money or enthusiasm among government and
industry. They include U.S. Memories, a joint government-industry
project that would have strengthened U.S. semiconductor businesses.
   In Japan, the government and large corporations have already
begun work on developing data highways.

<HEAD>Senate Moving to Reimposing Restraints on Cable Operators</HEAD>

   The Senate is moving toward reimposing price
restraints on cable television six years after it decided to lift
controls on a younger, less powerful cable TV industry.
   Faced with rising constituent complaints about prices and
service, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee
on Thursday approved a bill that would allow local governments to
control some cable TV prices.
   ``This is a major victory for the American public,'' Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., said following the 18-1 vote. ``Millions of
subscribers are fed up with high prices and `who cares' service. The
message is that help is on the way.''
   ``We oppose the bill, but we recognize, too, that it is a
significant improvement over the original staff draft,'' said John
Wolfe, spokesman for the National Cable Television Association.
   The association was concerned over last-minute changes on how
cable must deal with competitive distributors such as satellites and
``wireless cable'' trying to acquire cable programming.
   James Mooney, president of the association, said his group also
was concerned about provisions ordering the Federal Communications
Commission to consider limits on the number of cable systems one
company may own and the number of channels that may be occupied by a
programmer in which the cable operator has an interest.
   Mooney said that while his group would work to effect a
``reasonable bill'' in Congress, ``We cannot accept legislation that
hampers the ability of our industry to continue to grow, and to
serve our subscribers.''
   Thursday's vote marked the first time lawmakers have moved to
restore some of the regulation of the cable industry that Congress
lifted in the 1984 Cable Act.
   The 1984 law ended local rate regulation effective in 1987, and
since then cable prices have risen dramatically.
   Prospects for the bill's passage in the full Senate were unclear.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher wrote Danforth and committee
Chairman Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., that the administration
opposed the bill because it emphasized regulation at the expense of
trying to improve competition in the cable industry.
   The cable industry also vowed to fight any attempt to amend the
legislation to allow telephone companies into the cable business.
   Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., agreed to withdraw an amendment
Thursday that would have allowed non-Bell telephone companies to own
cable TV programming after he was assured the committee would vote
on a separate bill before the cable measure goes to the Senate floor.
   Several cable re-regulation proposals also are pending in the
House and may be voted on by the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee by the end of the month.
   The Senate bill, among other things, would:
   _Allow local governments to regulate prices for a ``basic tier''
of channels including local over-the-air broadcast channels.
Ad-supported pay cable channels such as ESPN, CNN and MTV would not
be subject to local rate regulation. However, if local authorities
or a subscriber complains about rate increases for such ad-supported
cable channels, the FCC could establish ``reasonable rates'' if it
finds them to be excessive.
   _Require cable operators not to discriminate against cable
programmers such as movie channels with which they have no
affiliation. Some cable companies are owned by giant conglomerates
that also own movie channels.
   _Require that all cable programmers make their programming
available to owners of home satellite dishes.

<TEXT>
   The first woman to serve as executive director of
the American Bar Association is resigning amid mixed reviews, ending
a sometimes stormy three-year tenure.
   Jill Wine-Banks, a 47-year-old former Watergate prosecutor,
submitted her resignation Thursday to L. Stanley Chauvin Jr.,
president of the 360,000-member bar. She was hired in August 1987
for the post, which now pays $225,000 a year.
   ``Although my tenure at the American Bar Association has been an
exciting and challenging time, I am now eager and ready to move on
to explore several other exciting opportunities awaiting me,''
Wine-Banks wrote.
   Chauvin credited Wine-Banks with streamlining the bar
association's bureaucracy, reforming its budget process and putting
into effect the first long-range plan the association ever had.
   ``And she broadened the association's appeal to women, minorites,
younger people,'' Chauvin said.
   Others welcomed her departure.
   ``Frankly, the mainstream of the ABA's membership will applaud
this change,'' said former ABA president Eugene Thomas. ``The
leadership sets the tone and we want someone who sets a different
one.''
   Wine-Banks drew unwanted attention last year when news stories
suggested that she had used her political clout to seek disciplinary
charges against a veterinarian for mistreating her Dalmatian, who
died after eating a tampon.
   She said she had the right to complain about Mell Wostoupal, who
eventually was suspended for 45 days from practice.
   At the time, Thomas wrote a letter to bar association leaders
calling for Wine-Banks' resignation, saying she ``does not
understand the use of power and lacks a sense of decorum and
propriety in professional matters.''
   At a closed-door meeting last year, the board of governors
decided not to fire her.
   Wine-Banks also was criticized for wasting the association's
money when she traveled to and from work in a limousine equipped
with a television. Chauvin said she opted for renting the limo
because it was cheaper than the cost of a car, which the association
had agreed to buy her.
   She called the charges that she misused her power ``total
baloney.''
   ``The people I admire and respect felt very positively about my
performance and that's what matters to me,'' Wine-Banks said.
   George Bushnell Jr., head of the bar's House of Delegates, said
Wine-Banks was criticized because of ``culture shock.''
   ``The ABA has, until the last five years, been an organization of
staid and conservative male lawyers,'' Bushnell said. ``Jill was
neither staid nor conservative nor male. She caused a lot of
discomfort simply because she represented radical change.''

<HEAD>USX Shareholders Reject Icahn's Spinoff Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn said he would
continue his battle to increase the value of USX Corp. stock despite
shareholders' rejection of his plan to spin off the company's steel
division.
   ``We have a number of options that we're exploring,'' Icahn said
Thursday. ``We have no definite plans, but we are going to continue
to be very involved as far as what is happening.''
   USX said Thursday preliminary results of the vote count show
about 57.1 percent of shareholders _ representing about 99.9 million
shares _ rejected the proposal, while 42.9 percent _ representing
about 75 million shares _ voted for it.
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder with a 13.3 percent stake, holds
about 33.9 million of the shares cast for the proposal, the company
said.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said the vote meant shareholders
have ``decisively supported our policy of well considered and
prudent corporate change.
   ``Management is dedicated to improving the corporation's
operations and financial position,'' he said. ``Corporate
restructuring will continue as opportunities arise and when it is in
the best interest of all of our shareholders.''
   Greg Drahuschak, a steel analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer in
Pittsburgh, said Icahn's failure to gain the support of even a
simple majority signaled sound rejection of his plan.
   ``The management has been in the driver's seat ever since Icahn
stepped in the door and they knew it,'' Drahuschak said. ``Down the
line, some of Icahn's ideas are going to happen, but in management's
time.''
   Icahn explained the loss by saying a few institutional investors
sided with USX management even though they agreed with his spinoff
plan. Icahn said the institutions told him they received indications
from management they would undertake a ``meaningful restructuring''
soon.
   Shareholders voted on the non-binding proposal at the company's
annual meeting in Findlay, Ohio, on May 7, exactly one month before
the results were announced.
   Icahn proposed spinning off at least 80 percent of the company's
steel division in the form of a dividend to shareholders, contending
the move would boost USX's stock.
   Icahn contends the relatively weak steel business is depressing
USX's stock price and is a potential drag on the company if the
economy slows. He wants the company to shift its focus to its energy
businesses, including Marathon Oil Co.
   Icahn said that while campaigning for his proposal, he was
``disappointed by what appeared to be a `whispering campaign' that I
might be a seller of the stock, which I believe was another factor
in the tally.''
   Icahn said he had no intention of selling his stock.

<HEAD>EC Environment Ministers Fix 1997 for Total CFC Elimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community environment ministers Friday
agreed to fix 1997 as the deadline for eliminating the manufacture
and use within the community of a gas that destroys the earth's
protective ozone layer.
   They also said they would negotiate with other countries to
enforce a total international ban on chlorofluorocarbons between by
2000.
   Although the decision does not yet have the force of law in the
12-nation EC, a spokesman for the EC's executive commission said a
law would be adopted by the end of this year.
   The law would mean that EC industries that use
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as a cooling agent or as an aerosol
component would have to use alternative technologies.
   The ministers also decided to try at a meeting on the Montreal
Protocol in London later this month to forge an international
agreement to end worldwide use of CFCs by the year 2000.
   The Montreal Protocol, signed by 40 nations in 1987, agrees to
cut the use of CFCs in half by 1998.
   Large developing nations like India, China, Mexico and Brazil
have not signed the Protocol, arguing that it would cost them too
much money to introduce new technologies. They said they would need
$230 million in an international fund in order to develop
alternative technologies.
   Diplomatic sources said the Commission would likely suggest the
creation of such a fund at the London meeting.
   Sources also said the Netherlands, Italy, West Germany and France
strongly backed the idea of raising money for the fund by taxing
both manufacturers and users of CFCs.

<HEAD>Japan's First Linear Train Railway Route Chosen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26.7-mile route near Tokyo has been picked as the
site for a $2.3 billion test track for a superfast, magnetically
levitated linear train, the Transportation Ministry said Friday.
   The first-phase of construction on the 343-mph system will start
later this year for completion by late 1994. Following a three-year
test period, the railway will go into business by the end of 1997,
officials said.
   The test track, linking Sakaigawamura and Akiyamamura in
Yamanashi Prefecture northwest of Tokyo, could become part of a
Tokyo-Nagoya or a Tokyo-Osaka ``Maglev'' railway, officials added.
Nagoya is 169 miles west of Tokyo, while Osaka is 255 miles west of
Tokyo.
   Japan began searching in 1962 for ways to apply superconductive
materials, which carry electricity without any resistance, to
building a commercial version of a high-speed train that floats
above its tracks.
   In 1988, researchers at the Railway Technical Research Institute
set a record of 321 mph _ then a world record _ on a 4-mile test
track near Miyazaki City. So far about $302 million has been spent
on developing the system, the government said.
   The train is guided by a magnetic field instead of by rigid
rails. The train's powerful superconducting magnets suspend it 4
inches above hundreds of oppositely charged metal coils set in the
base of its U-shaped guideway. They also keep the train centered in
the guideway and propel it forward, through attraction to
electromagnets along the guideway's walls.
   In the United States, a bill introduced in Congress in April
would spend $350 million over three years to develop a magnetic
levitation system that would whisk passengers between major U.S.
cities in streamlined capsules.
   The 300-mph U.S. system is aimed at competing with the high-speed
transportation systems under development in Japan and Germany.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Embittered U.S. business leaders told Congress
Japanese companies copy their designs then, with the help of the
Japanese government, push the U.S. firm out of the market.
   ``We are in a trade war with Japan ... that the Japanese are
equipped to win through MITI, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry,'' Edgar Otto, head of Therma Systems Inc. of
Plainfield, New Jersey, told the Congressional Task Force on
Technology Transfer Thursday.
   Otto said his company's insulated ``thermal trays'' for serving
food hot to hospital patients revolutionized an antiquated serving
system in Japan. After five years of success, his Japanese
distributor, with the excuse that the U.S. trays were declining in
quality, abrubtly switched to an affiliated Japanese supplier it had
quietly commissioned to copy his design, Otto said.
   Nancy H. Chasen of Rockville, Maryland, said after initial
success her high technology firm, Fusions Corp., ``collided directly
with a massive structural barrier in the form of the Japanese patent
system.''
   Long waiting periods for patent approval coupled with the
practice of quickly making applications public invites behavior that
in the United States would be regarded as fraud or piracy, she said.
   ``Yet the Japanese patent fraud statute has never been enforced
and predatory companies feel free to target promising technologies
and to file for patents derived from the products of others,'' she
added.
   Ms. Chasen said U.S. negotiators in the year-old Structural
Impediment talks with Japan should insist on ``meaningful
intellectual property rights provisions,'' persuading the Japanese
``to upgrade their system to the standard of those in the U.S. and
Europe.''
   Ken W. Cole, vice president of Allied Signal Inc. of Morristown,
N.J., said his aerospace and engineering firm filed an unfair
practices complaint last March with the U.S. Trade Representative.
   He said MITI organized and helped fund a 34-corporation group
that told Allied to license its property rights for power
transformers at a low price ``or else to stay out of Japan.'' He
said Allied was told no one would buy from them if they didn't cut
the license price.
   Cole described it as ``a classic case'' of the Japanese
government targeting an advanced technology for development by its
own industries.

back a bit in the last few days.
   The upbeat mood was tempered by indications from the Federal

policy on the basis of a few months of sluggish economic growth.
   That posed some questions about how much lower interest rates
might go in the immediate future after their sharp drop since late

<BYLINE>Are Casino Bonds a Crap Shoot or a Good Bet?
^By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For bondholders of Donald Trump's three Atlantic
City casinos, the gambling doesn't stop at the tables.
   News that bankers were in negotiations with the eponymous
developer and might seek to force him to sell assets sent prices of
the casino bonds plunging early last week.
   Junk bonds backed by the Taj Mahal, the new billion-dollar resort
that some analysts consider the shakiest leg of the Trump empire,
lost 10 percent of their face value in one day alone.
   Although they ended the week well off their lows, the 14 percent
bonds still traded at less than 60 percent of face value. At that
price, the bonds would yield more than 27 percent to maturity in
1998, assuming the Taj can generate the income to make its payments.
   The low price reflects investor worries that Trump's casinos
could turn out to be another Resorts International Inc.
   That gaming company, which Trump sold to Merv Griffin in exchange
for the Taj, defaulted on its bonds last year. Resorts is seeking
court approval of a plan it hopes will take it out of Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
   Given the experiences of Trump and Resorts, investors may think
twice about buying bonds _ usually considered among the safest of
investments _ if they are issued by a company dependent on gambling.
   Some analysts and fund managers see nothing wrong with gaming per
se, but they offer plenty of caveats.
   ``The casino industry as a whole is a relatively stable
industry,'' says Robert Nelson, vice president at the rating agency
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   The key to judging investments in the field, Nelson says, is to
find casino operators whose properties are well-built, well-managed
and located in prime areas. It also helps to be diversified
geographically so a slowdown in one market, such as Atlantic City,
doesn't threaten the business, he adds.
   S&amp;P has looked at the field, and it gives only one casino company
an investment-grade rating: Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. That
company has casinos in the major Nevada markets and later this month
plans to open the world's largest hotel, the 4,000-room,
castle-shaped Excalibur, in Las Vegas.
   B. Daniel Evans, president of Fitch Investors Services Inc., says
casinos can be real cash cows if operators attract a steady stream
of high rollers.
   ``It's run like an insurance business, except it's on a cash
basis like a McDonald's,'' he says.
   The house odds for a casino are like an insurer's actuarial
tables, Evans says. A lucky gambler or card-counter may make a
killing, but over time the odds are in the house's favor and the
take can be predicted with some precision.
   Trump's problem, Evans says, is volume. The Taj Mahal represented
a big increase in capacity for an Atlantic City market that has
shown little growth in recent years.
   ``If the Taj goes well, it has to go at the expense of other
entities,'' including the Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casinos,
Evans says. (Indeed, holders of the Plaza and Castle bonds last week
sued Trump claiming he short-changed the casinos by steering high
rollers to the Taj Mahal.)
   Ralph Stellmacher, manager of Oppenheimer's High Yield Fund, says
he is not too concerned about the fund's holdings of Trump Plaza and
Castle bonds because they are secured by mortgages on the properties.
   ``Unless the bottom falls out from underneath Mr. Trump, they
represent good value here,'' he said.
   The fund also has bought some of Resorts bonds recently,
expecting to profit from the company's reorganization, he said. The
plan calls for investors to exchange $927 million in Resorts bonds
for a 78 percent stake in the company and $430 million in new bonds.
It would leave Resorts ``well-capitalized,'' Stellmacher said.
   Evans said the decline of Trump's bonds show the market's
skittishness. The risky economics behind the Taj have been known for
months, he said. Only the publicity about Trump's reported problems
and supposed fall from the ranks of billionaires has changed, he
says.
   ``To own these bonds, you've got to be patient and be able to
take a long-term view,'' Evans says. ``Certainly at these prices, it
increases your gambler's odds.''

<HEAD>Portugal Unveils Plan to Cut Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government unveiled plans Friday to
slash the country's deficit and lower inflation in an effort to
prevent Portugal from falling behind as Europe approaches economic
and monetary union in 1992.
   Finance Minister Miguel Beleza said in a statement that an
economic adjustment plan would cut current public sector spending
and possibly raise some tax rates on purchases.
   Economists have warned the large public sector deficit has
overheated the economy, boosting inflation and damaging Portugal's
chances of meeting EC deadlines for monetary integration.
   According to government forecasts, the 1990 deficit will total
about $4.1 billion. Inflation registered 12.9 percent on an
annualized basis in April, about double the EC average.
   Beleza said the program aims to halve the public sector deficit
in five years, to 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product, and
trim inflation to below 5 percent.
   Beleza said Portugal must fully participate in the EC's plans for
economic and monetary union in order to influence the future shape
of the 12-nation trade block.
   He restated Portugal's commitment to place the escudo in the
exchange rate mechanism of the EC's European Monetary System but
insisted it wold have to be handled cautiously.
   The exchange rate mechanism fixes nine EC currencies at a set
rate against the European Currency Unit and permits them to
fluctuate within fixed limits on either side of that rate.
   A statement Wednesday by Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's
that Portugal would join the exchange rate mechanism soon prompted a
burst of speculative buying of escudos on world markets.
   Portugal, Greece and Britain are the only EC nations outside the
mechanism.
   The remaining EC countries are Belgium, Denmark, West Germany,
France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands.

<HEAD>Japan To Use Motorola System as Standard For Digital Cellular Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has chosen voice-coder technology
manufactured by Motorola Inc. as Japan's national standard for
new-generation digital cellular phones, officials said Friday.
   Motorola, which has long fought to increase its foothold in the
Japanese market, was selected from among eight Japanese and foreign
companies.
   The decision, the first to allow Motorola technology to be used
nationwide, could pave the way for other foreign electronics
companies in the Japanese market, said an official at the mobile
phone division of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry.
   The ministry official said the action showed the Japanese market
is now open to foreign competitors. ``The result also proved the
excellence of the U.S. technology,'' he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``Anybody, regardless of whether Japanese or foreign, can sell
their products here only if the quality is high. It's up to how much
effort each company will make,'' he said.
   The decision follows an unprecedented agreement in April to
attack the underlying economic reasons for the persistent U.S. trade
deficit with Japan. Under a trade agreement called the Structural
Impediments Initiative, Japan promised to reform the closed-door
policies long employed to bar foreign competition.
   The cellular phone issue had been a major dispute between Japan
and the United States, although it was excluded from the list of
high-priority trade issues under the 1988 Trade Act.
   Motorola's CODEC speech coder system _ the technology to
digitalize voice sounds and send them to a receiving unit _ proved
best among those offered, said Kiyohiro Omatsuzawa, a spokesman for
a government-backed Research and Development Center for Radios
System.
   Most existing cellular phone systems are based on analog
technology, but digital systems, which allow vastly more callers to
use the service at once, are believed to be the wave of the future.
   Omatsuzawa said major manufacturers will produce trial equipment
based on Motorola's design before starting mass production. Such
digital cellular phones will be marketed by the end of 1991,
replacing the current telephone with analog system, he said.
   He said other competitors were Sweden's Ericsson and Japan's
Toshiba Corp., NTT, NEC Corp., Matsushita Communication Industrial
Co., Mitsubishi Electric Co. and Fujitsu.
   Ministry commissions are studying details of the standards for
the new transmission system.
   Last month, Japan Mobile Communications, also known as IDO,
signed a contract with Motorola to supply cellular equipment but
only for the corridor between Tokyo and Japan's central city of
Nagoya.
   For the last two years, Motorola has also supplied cellular phone
system equipment to DDI, a Japanese company, while selling cellular
phones to both DDI and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   In June, a bilateral agreement opened the way for the
introduction of Motorola's cellular phone technology in the greater
Tokyo area, which had been limited to NTT technology.

<HEAD>Weather Concerns Guide Grain, Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn prices opened higher as rains continue to hamper planting
and increases the likelihood of a reduced crop yield, said Victor
Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. However,
traders began to liquidate their positions for the weekend, and
futures were moving lower.
   Soybean futures were steady to slightly lower as soggy fields
delay the planting of the soybean crop. But the potential for
increased soybean acreage as farmers switch from corn is weighing on
prices.
   Wheat futures were higher on reports that disease is spreading

<HEAD>McDonald's To Post Nutritional Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. said today it will post complete
nutritional information _ including fat and sodium levels _ on all
of its products at its restaurants by the end of July.
   ``The more (customers) know about McDonald's food, ... the easier
it will be for them to see how McDonald's fits into their balanced
diet,'' said Terri Capatosto, spokeswoman for the Oak Brook-based
fast-food giant.
   McDonald's drew fire from anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof
this spring when the Omaha, Neb., industrialist took out full-page
ads in newspapers across the country pleading with McDonald's to cut
the fat in its hamburgers.
   Sokolof's ad, under the headline ``The Poisoning of America,''
was attacked by McDonald's as misleading and malicious.
   Ms. Capatosto said today's announcement had nothing to do with
Sokolof's campaign.
   ``We've been providing complete nutrition information since
1973,'' she said. ``We've provided nutrition information in booklet
form since 1986.
   ``What we're trying to do now is make it as easy as possible for
customers to get information before they make a purchase at
McDonald's.''
   The company will post nutritional information on the ``customer
side'' of its more than 8,200 restaurants, she said. Posters will
include nutrient values as well as complete ingredient listings, she
said.
   Sokolof was not immediately available for comment.

   Texas Instruments Inc. blamed defense department
cuts today when announcing a plan to reduce its workforce by about
1,000 employees over the next year.
   The cuts will come at the company's Defense Systems &amp; Electronics
Group, which employs about 22,000 people primarily in the United
States, Texas Instruments said.
   ``As we told stockholders at out annual meeting in April, we
expect defense markets to decline for at least the first half of the
1990s as the U.S. Department of Defense adjusts to the changing
world political environment,'' said William B. Mitchell, TI
executive vice president and DSEG president.
   The employees affected may be able to bid for other jobs in the
company, the company said. All will be given job placement
assistance.
   Texas Instruments develops, manufactures and markets
semiconductors, defense electronics systems, software, computer
systems and consumer electronics products.
   The company said it did not expect the workforce reduction to
have much effect on its second-quarter financial results.
   ``Our strategy is to size our defense business to the declining
market and then, as the market stabilizes, drive for increased
market share,'' Mitchell said. ``TI has a strong technology base and
a good mix of programs, which will help the company remain a strong
competitor in the defense market of the 1990s.''
   The company reported 1989 earnings of $6.5 billion, up from $6.4
billion in the previous year. First quarter revenues were $1.5
billion, down about 4 percent from the same quarter the previous
year.
   DSEG is headquartered in Dallas with plants at Lewisville,
McKinney, Abilene, Austin and Sherman in Texas. The group also has
plants in Ridgecrest, Calif., and Colorado Springs, Colo.

   Stock prices declined broadly today as the slow
but steady decline of the past three sessions continued.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 37.86 points over
the last three trading days, dropped 10.19 to 2,887.14 by noontime
on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 420 up, 849 down and
555 unchanged.
   Analysts said the enthusiasm built up in the market's advance to
record highs as recently as Monday had cooled down as prices pulled
back a bit in the last few days.
   The upbeat mood was tempered by indications from the Federal
Reserve that it wasn't ready to adopt a more stimulative credit
policy on the basis of a few months of sluggish economic growth.
   That posed some questions about how much lower interest rates
might go in the immediate future after their sharp drop since late
April.
   Rates were narrowly mixed in the credit markets this morning.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak lost &lsqb; to 42&rsqb;;
International Business Machines { to 120&lsqb;; Exxon { to 47&lsqb;, and
Philip Morris \ to 44|.
   The Gap fell 2&rsqb; to 56&lsqb; on top of a 4&rsqb;-point drop Thursday after

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.08 to 197.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.14 at 362.43.

   First Interstate Bancorp said Friday it has
agreed to sell a San Diego-based consumer lending operation, Nova
Financial Services, to a Transamerica Corp. subsidiary for about
$108 million in cash.
   First Interstate announced in March it intended to sell Nova as
part of its strategy to focus on consumer banking and middle-market
lending in its 14-state territory. It said the sale of Nova would
yield a pretax gain of more than $90 million.
   Nova makes loans through 71 offices in California, Colorado and
Hawaii. It had nearly $430 million in loans outstanding as of March
31.
   The sale, expected to close in July, is part of a trend toward
specialization in financial services. Many banks, for example, have
sold their credit card debt processing operations to huge companies
specializing in that business.
   Transamerica Finance Group, the nation's third largest
independent finance company based on capital funds, is involved in
consumer lending, commercial lending and leasing.

<HEAD>Kaifu Says No to U.S. Pressure A Day After Major Trade Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM MINEHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Friday he would
not give in to a key U.S. trade demand that Japan specify targets
for boosting its public works spending, a hoped-for wedge in opening
the market here to more foreign business.
   Kaifu's tough stand, coming a day after a stunning trade
breakthrough in which Japan accepted U.S. technology as a
cellular-phone standard, suggests the government intends to assert
itself despite heavy pressure for economic reform.
   Japan agreed in April to increase public spending as part of an
unprecedented pact to reduce its $49 billion trade surplus with the
United States by attacking trade barriers. But the prime minister
has come under harsh criticism in Parliament for bowing to U.S.
demands.
   Kaifu said Friday that Japan would refuse to specify the ratio of
public works spending to its gross national product in a final
report on the April agreement, called the Structural Impediments
Initiative.
   ``It was settled in the interim report (in April),'' Kaifu told
reporters. ``I don't quite understand why they are raising the issue
again.''
   Japan did agree then to boost public spending, which would expand
the number of projects that U.S. firms could bid on.
   But the United States had sought a definite annual spending
target. Japan, rejecting what it called interference in internal
affairs, said it would specify a total figure for the next 10 years
and decide yearly spending flexibly to avoid overheating the economy.
   Kaifu's firm stand was a striking contrast to Thursday's
announcement. The government, in what may be the most potent symbol
of Japan's recent willingness to open its markets, said it was
adopting digital cellular-phone technology made by Motorola, Inc.,
as a national standard.
   ``That has been unthinkable during the past 40 years, but it
happened,'' said Richard C. Koo, senior economist with the Nomura
Research Institute, a think tank connected with Nomura Securities.
``I was stunned.''
   Motorola's CODEC speech coder system _ the technology to
digitalize voice sounds and send them to a receiving unit _
outperformed six Japanese and one Swedish company to be chosen as
the national standard, Japanese officials said.
   Koo said the significance of the decision is that it came without
the overt pressure and acrimonious debate that marked previous trade
talks.
   ``The Japanese side moved before it became an issue,'' he said.
``It really is a first for Japan. ... And it couldn't have been made
without decisions at the highest level.''
   The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications chose Motorola over
Japanese giants Toshiba Corp., Nippon Telephone and Telegraph, NEC
Corp., Matsushita Communication Industrial Co., Mitsubishi Electric
Co. and Fujitsu as well as Sweden's Ericsson.
   A ministry official said the action showed the Japanese market
now is open to foreign competitors. ``The result also proved the
excellence of the U.S. technology,'' he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``Anybody, regardless of whether Japanese or foreign, can sell
their products here only if the quality is high. It's up to how much
effort each company will make,'' he said.
   Motorola, which lost its once-signature television business to
Japanese competitors and eventually sold its TV division to
Matsushita in 1974, long has fought to increase its foothold in the
Japanese market with other technologies.
   The Schaumburg, Ill.-based company first tried to enter Japan's
cellular phone market in the mid-1980s and met stiff resistance. In
1987, the United States and Japan agreed that Japan would operate
under two cellular standards: NTT's in the busy Tokyo-Nagoya strip
and Motorola's in the rest of the country. Phones using one standard
did not operate in the other's territory.
   Last year, under the threat of U.S. trade sanctions on 50
Japanese products, Japan agreed to open its cellular phone market
and allow Motorola to compete in the Tokyo area.
   Japan's cellular phone market is estimated to be worth about $2
billion over the next five years.

   Japan's desire to avoid U.S. trade retaliation and
its growing realization that many Japanese consumers want the
benefits of an open market have already forced some restructuring of
business practices, economists say.
   While U.S. and Japanese negotiators meet in Tokyo on June 25-26
to hammer out the final report on the groundbreaking Structural
Impediments Initiative, the government even now is implementing some
of pact's reforms:
   _Last month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
told local governments it has shortened the application period for
opening large retail stores to 18 months. Under previous law, the
application could take up to 10 years, effectively shutting most
U.S. retailers out of the market.
   _On June 6, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued new
anti-monopoly enforcement guidelines that would prohibit
manufacturers from pressuring discount shops that sell goods below
manufacturer-recommended prices.
   As part of the SII agreements in April, Japan agreed to
deregulate its complex distribution system, including a relaxation
on the establishment of large retail stores, to increase enforcement
of antitrust laws with tougher penalties for bid-rigging, and to
work to lower land prices.
   The agreements came during a flurry of Japanese concessions aimed
at keeping the United States from putting Japan on a retaliatory
``hit list'' of countries with the most offensive trade barriers.
   ``There is a sea change going on, slowly but surely,'' said
Richard C. Koo, senior economist with the Nomura Research Institute.
``It's in the interest of the United States not to press too hard to
the point that it invites negative reaction.''

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell in heavy
trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather remains the key force driving the market, as forecasts
call for dry conditions for the corn and soybean crop producing
areas into next week with a return of wet conditions late in the
week, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Corn prices were pushed lower by profit-taking, with the market
ignoring planting delays and the possibility of yield losses from
late planting of fields.
   Soybean futures were pushed lower by pre-weekend liquidation and
professional selling.
   Soybeans also came under pressure from a concern that additional
acres will be planted in areas of the Midwest where corn planting
has been delayed.
   Soybeans can be planted in the southern Midwest into the first
week of July because they mature faster than corn.
   Wheat fell as traders shrugged off reports of disease ravaging
soft red winter wheat crops in the lower Midwest.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents lower to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.30} a bushel; corn was 3\ cents
lower to a \ cent higher with July at $2.84 a bushel; oats were a {
cent lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $1.48} a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with July at $6 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Newsweek magazine has selected John Emmerling
Inc. to develop a major new advertising campaign, the nation's
second biggest weekly newsmagazine said Friday.
   The magazine, which is owned by Washington Post Co., plans to
spend more than $1.5 million this year on advertising aimed mainly
at those who buy or place ads, officials said.
   Publisher Peter Eldredge said Emmerling was selected because its
president, John Emmerling, is ``one of the best in the business at
creating impactful campaigns for magazines.''
   The agency created ``The rewards of money'' campaign that Money
magazine has used since 1984 and the new ``Power People'' ads for
Reader's Digest. It also is the agency for the Magazine Publishers
of America, a trade association.
   Industry executives said officials at Money, which is owned by
Time Warner Inc., asked Emmerling to resign as their agency after
taking the Newsweek job, and the agency was expected to do so. Time
Warner's flagship magazine is Time, Newsweek's foremost rival.
   A call was placed to Money magazine for comment but the
magazine's spokesman was said to be unavailable until next week.
   Emmerling replaces the Bergman Group as Newsweek's ad agency.
Bergman had worked for Newsweek for about 21 months, said Newsweek
spokeswoman Mary Manz. Its most recent ads used the line ``We're not
afraid to say it.''
   Newsweek ranks second among the major newsweeklies with average
circulation of 3.18 million in the six months ended Dec. 31,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Time had an average
circulation of 4.34 million over that period and U.S. News &amp; World
Report was third at 2.21 million.

   Fixed-rate home mortgages are currently
averaging 10.10 percent, down from 10.29 percent last week and the
lowest since a similar rate last Feb. 16, according to a national
survey released Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 8.50 percent this week, down from 8.55
percent the week before.
   The rates, compiled from a national survey, do not include add-on
fees known as points.

<HEAD>States Asked To Lower Wine Barriers Against Each Other</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national task force on the wine industry
says it is time the 50 states stopped treating each other like
foreign countries and buried the restless corpse of Prohibition.
   The 33-state task force is asking the National Conference on
State Legislatures to standardize licensing, unify state-federal and
interstate regulations, and consider reciprocal shipping agreements
between states.
   ``Complying with (the) staggering array of state and federal
regulation tests the stamina of every American wine producer,'' task
force chairman Dominic L. Cortese said Friday.
   The task force's recommendations, released this week after a year
of hearings, attempt to deal with barriers created with Prohibition
Repeal in 1933, when the states were permitted to retain elements of
that 14-year experiment as they saw fit.
   The task force, noting that 43 states make wine from the grapes
produced by 8,000 grape growers, said the wine industry ``is one of
the most heavily regulated industries in the United States.''
   ``As a grower of grapes, the wine producer is subject to all
agricultural regulation. As a producer of wine he or she is subject
to alcohol regulation at both the federal and state level,'' the
task force report said.
   ``Each state has its own comprehensive set of regulations. Each
state has its own bewildering laws regarding wine, and no two states
have the same laws. The federal government has its own comprehensive
set of regulations. As a result, wine is one of the few products
where interstate sales are spoken of in terms of `import' and
`export.'''
   The trade barriers between the states, said the task force, ``are
bad for business and employment. They steal the competitive edge and
ultimately are bad for the state and national economies.''
   Above all, said the lawmakers, a joint committee should be formed
``with the liquor administrators to review the uniformity of laws
among the states and make recommendations regarding policies that
could be adopted by all the states.''
   Since the 21st amendment told the states they could make their
own licensed beverage laws, the federal government would not be
involved in much of what the wine task force hopes to accomplish,
said Cortese, who also chairman of the state Assembly Select
Committee on California Wine Production and Economy.
   The recommendations are the product of four hearings in Tulsa,
Okla.; Santa Fe, New Mex.; Sacramento, Calif., and Boise, Idaho. The
general membership of the NCSL, made up of state lawmakers, will
vote on them in August in Nashville, Tenn.
   The U.S. wine industry accounts for 250,000 jobs and $12 billion
in retail sales annually, according to the California Wine Institute.

   Stock prices recorded a broad loss today as the
decline of the past three sessions continued.
   Analysts said the enthusiasm built up in the market's advance to
record highs as recently as Monday had cooled down as prices pulled
back a bit in the last few days.
   The upbeat mood was tempered by indications from the Federal
Reserve that it wasn't ready to adopt a more stimulative credit
policy on the basis of a few months of sluggish economic growth.
   That posed some questions about how much lower interest rates
might go in the immediate future after their sharp drop since late
April.
   Rates edged upward in the credit markets today, putting yields on
long-term Treasury bonds in the 8.44 percent-8.47 percent range.

<HEAD>Medtronic Agrees To Buy Bio-Medicus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardiac pacemaker giant Medtronic Inc. said
Friday it had agreed to buy Bio-Medicus Inc. for $190 million in a
bid to diversify its line of cardiovascular medical devices.
   The two biotechnology companies settled on a stock swap worth $25
a share to Bio-Medicus shareholders, but the value and stock
exchange ratio could change based on fluctuations in Medtronic's
stock price.
   Bio-Medicus' board of directors accepted the bid in a meeting
Thursday night, hours after Medtronic sweetened its bid. Medtronic's
initial offer would have given Bio-Medicus shareholders a value of
about $21.63 a share.
   The agreement is subject to approval by Bio-Medicus' shareholders
and Medtronic's board of directors, reaching a definitive agreement,
qualification for pooling of interests accounting treatment and
regulatory approvals. In addition, Medtronic could kill the deal if
its own stock price falls below $72.50 a share, the companies said.
   Medtronic fell $3.12{ a share to $76.50 in trading Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Bio-Medicus rose 50 cents a share to
$23.62{ in over-the-counter trading.
   Eden Prairie-based Bio-Medicus is the world leader in the $30
million market for disposable blood pumps used during open-heart
surgery. Fridley-based Medtronic is the largest maker of cardiac
pacemakers, but also makes blood oxygenators, other cardivascular
products, drug pumps and other products.
   Medtronic this week reported revenue of $837 million for the year
ending April 30. Bio-Medicus generated $31 million in sales in the
year ending in March.
   Bernard McDonagh, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in
Minneapolis, said Medtronic's sweetened offer was a reflection of
its success selling blood oxygenators, devices used in conjuction
with pumps during surgery. Oxygenator sales were up 40 percent in
the quarter just ended, McDonagh said.
   David Duclos, a medical analyst for Minneapolis-based Wessels,
Arnold &amp; Henderson, said he thought the acquistion of Bio-Medicus
would be good for Medtronic, which has recently been expanding in
related medical fields.
   The exchange ratio tentatively is set at 3.1 shares of
Bio-Medicus common stock for each share of Medtronic stock.
   Above a Medtronic stock price of $92, the ratio will adjust to
provide $29.68 in value to Bio-Medicus shareholders. Between $72.50
and $77.50 the ratio will adjust to provide $25 in value to
Bio-Medicus shareholders. Below $72.50 the ratio will adjust to
provide $25 in value to Bio-Medicus shareholders, but Medtronic can
elect to kill the deal instead of adjusting the ratio below $72.50.
   The final exchange ratio will be based on the 10 trading days
prior to the effective date, which will be in approximately 75 to
120 days, the companies said.
   Medtronic already owns 5.5 percent of Bio-Medicus' 8 million
shares.

   The United States and Poland signed an
agreement creating a new airline route to Miami and a new connection
to Los Angeles, the official PAP agency reported Friday.
   A Polish-U.S. agreement on air transport was signed for an
indefinite period of time during talks in Warsaw from June 6-8, the
agency said.
   The agreement allows the Polish national carrier LOT to start up
regular flights to Miami, making it the third city served by the
airline after New York and Chicago, PAP said.
   LOT also has the right to a connection with Los Angeles as part
of cooperation with U.S. air carriers, the agency reported.
   The United States has the largest population of people of Polish
descent outside Poland, and many Polish families have relatives on
the other side of the Atlantic.

   President Bush told pork producers Friday
that his administration continues to push for including all
agricultural products in a new international trade accord, despite
stiff resistance from Europe.
   Leaders of the swine industry, meantime, announced an alliance
with colleagues in Canada and Mexico to attack barriers to sales of
their products overseas and ``provide ammunition'' to U.S.
negotiators at the Uruguay Round of talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Farm trade already is big business. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates total U.S. agricultural exports will reach
approximately $40 billion in the fiscal year that ends in September.
   Expanding export markets for pork, particularly in Japan, has
helped fuel a surge in hog prices, which reached record heights last
week in the United States.
   Pork products accounted for a record $325 million in U.S. farm
exports in 1989. But Mike Wehler of Plain, Wis., president of the
National Pork Producers Council, said he told Bush that despite a
growing export market, ``we are a 6 percent to 7 percent net
importer of pork.''
   European markets have been tough to crack because of restrictive
standards and subsidized competition, pork producers complain.
   Bush said his administration is working to remove those barriers.
   ``We're determined to press in the Uruguay Round for all
agriculture products to be included,'' Bush told pork producers as a
pool of reporters was ushered out of the room at the start of the
meeting.
   ``It's hard to get this, and particularly to get the Europeans to
do what they should be doing in giving up markets,'' Bush said,
according to the pool report. ``I want you to know at the outset
we're not backing off ...''
   After the meeting, John Hardin of Danville, Ind., president-elect
of the pork council, praised what he said was the president's ``firm
commitment to protect agricultural interests in the Uruguay Round of
GATT.''
   Bush met for just under a half hour with 14 representatives of
the pork group following an appearance at a fund-raising breakfast
for Gov. Terry Branstad.
   Wehler said the council, which represents 300,000 pork producers,
believes its members are the most efficient producers in the world.
But he said U.S. pork is locked out of many markets by unfair
competition.
   ``We seek a level playing field,'' he told reporters at a
post-meeting briefing. ``We were pleased that he (Bush) was
supportive of those types of comments.''
   Wehler said the participation in a North American Alliance for
Pork with Canada and Mexico would help Secretary of Agriculture
Clayton Yeutter and Trade Representative Carla Hills in their talks
aimed at countering subsidies of competing foreign farm products.
   And even though U.S. and Canadian hog producers have battled in
the past on subsidies on Canadian pork products shipped to the
United States, Wehler told reporters ``some things we can agree
upon.''
   He said Bush ``encouraged us to keep the pressure on in the
export arena so that the producers of this country have the
opportunity to expand their market.''

<HEAD>Report: Greenwald's UAL Compensation at Least $9 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Chrysler Corp. executive Gerald Greenwald
will receive at least $9 million to spearhead the proposed employee
buyout of UAL Corp., even if the deal falls through, a newspaper
reported Friday.
   Greenwald, who had been in line to succeed Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca before his decision to leave for UAL last week, received a
$5 million bonus for signing on with the buyout group, The Wall
Street Journal said.
   He will receive an additional $4 million fee, even if the $4.54
billion buyout does not succeed, the newspaper reported citing
unidentified sources.
   Greenwald was out of the vice chairman's office at Chrysler until
Monday and not available for comment, his secretary said.
   UAL, parent company of United Airlines, referred all calls to the
United Employees Acquisition Corp., an entity formed by the
airline's unions to handle the buyout.
   Steven Matthews, a spokesman in New York for the employees'
group, said, ``We would have no comment at all on that.''
   The newspaper said that the five-year deal negotiated by
Greenwald included a $1.2 million annual salary, which began the day
the contract was signed.
   If the buyout is successful, the 54-year-old Greenwald, who would
become chairman and chief executive officer of UAL and United
Airlines, will receive an additional $1.2 million ``success fee'' in
the first year of his contract, the newspaper said.
   Unidentified union officials cited by the newspaper said current
Chairman Stephen M. Wolf received a $6.7 million bonus to take the
job three years ago.
   The employees, led by the Air Line Pilots Association, the
Machinists union and the Association of Flight Attendants, have
agreed to substantial wage concessions as part of the buyout.
   They are seeking to acquire backing for the deal before a
financing deadline of Aug. 9 set by UAL's board.
   Matthews said Greenwald is heading talks with potential financial
backers for the buyout, in addition to negotiating with United's
non-union employees.
   ``We're working on a fairly tight schedule,'' Matthews said.
   The group also has retained the executive search firm of Spencer
Stuart Associates to recommend outside directors for the 15-member
board.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Finish Mixed; Selloff in Gasoline Called a
Correction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale gasoline prices tumbled Friday while
home heating oil and crude finished moderately higher. Trading
volume was light to moderate.
   Energy analysts said futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange
bobbed up early in the session on rumors of a possible OPEC meeting
to address the recent slump in oil prices. But the buying subsided
when there was no confirmation that the oil cartel would meet.
   Crude and heating oil managed to end the day with minor gains due
to short covering, which is buying to compensate for previous sales.
   The contract for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, closed at $16.78 a 42-gallon
barrel, adding 11 cents. The contract lost 25 cents Thursday. Later
months also gains.
   The July contract for home heating oil rose 0.31 cent to 47.21
cents a gallon after losing 0.41 cent on Thursday. Subsequent months
settled unchanged to moderately higher.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery dropped 1.02 cents
to 56.59 cents a gallon, expanding Thursday's loss of 0.75 cent.
Most of the selling was confined to the July and August contracts;
later months ended modestly higher.
   John H. O'Connell, senior energy analyst at Refco Inc., said the
decline in gasoline came in reaction to bearish industry statistics
released earlier this week showing a buildup in oil stocks.
   He said gasoline prices had not responded to the earlier news as
fully as other energy futures so Friday's selling represented a
correction to previous market activity.
   A news report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries might convene a special session initially encouraged
buying. But the report, which O'Connell said was based on comments
by a South American OPEC official, came to be viewed with skepticism
by energy traders.
   In natural gas trading, prices ended mixed. The July contract
closed marginally higher at $1.575 per 1,000 cubic feet compared to
$1.573 on Thursday. Later contracts settled slightly lower to
slightly higher.

   Gold prices finished a sluggish week Friday on an
upbeat note and the dollar finished the day stronger against major
currencies.
   Gold, which has been increasingly shunned by investors may have
hit bottom on Thursday when the price in London reached a four-year
low at $351.50 in morning trading, one analyst said.
   ``I think if the market was going to break $350 it would have
happened this week,'' Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. said. ``It was the perfect climate for the market
to collapse and it didn't,'' he said referring to reports Thursday
of Middle East selling.
   Many traders fear Saudi Arabia has been selling large amounts of
gold lately, leading to at least two sharp drops in recent weeks.
   Bullion for current delivery rose $1.10 to $355.70 a troy ounce
on the New York Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank of New
York later quoted a bid of $355.00 a troy ounce, up $1.40 from late
Thursday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $354.50 a troy ounce
from $354.15 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing
bid of $354 from $353 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 39 cents an ounce to 356.06 per
ounce.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at $5.02 an ounce, up from
$5.01 bid late Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
silver for current delivery slipped 0.6 cent to close at $5.007 a
troy ounce.
   The dollar was stronger as investors anticipated next week's
economic reports. Many apparently felt the Consumer Price Index and
Producer Price Index could show stronger inflation, which could lead
to higher interest rates, said Robert Hatcher, corporate trader at
Barclay's Bank PLC in New York.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo, rising 0.10 yen to a
closing 152.65 Japanese yen. Later, in London, it also was quoted
higher at 153.48 yen, and in New York, it rose to 153.49 yen from
152.55 late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6843, compared with $1.6880 late Thursday. In New York
the pound also dropped against the dollar, falling to $1.6840 from
$1.6895 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.6975 West German marks, up from 1.6930;
1.4495 Swiss francs, up from 1.4445; 5.7145 French francs, up from
5.7035; 1,248.00 Italian lire, up from 1,244.75 and 1.1743 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.16975.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's

   Texas Instruments Inc. and General Dynamics Corp.,
a pair of major defense contractors, plan to lay off almost 2,000
people in Texas because of anticipated military budget cutbacks.
   Texas Instruments said Friday it will trim its Defense Systems &amp;
Electronics Group by about 1,000 employees in the next year.
   The announcement came one day after General Dynamics announced
planned cuts of 500 to 800 people over the next few months at its
Fort Worth division.
   Both companies said their decisions were influenced by the
shrinking U.S. defense dollar.
   Improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union
have resulted in a series of arms reductions, and lawmakers are
showing an increasing reluctance to keep purchasing new military
hardware.
   ``It's unfortunate that our industry and employees must bear the
brunt of these changes; it is the price we in this industry will pay
for enhanced world peace and stability,'' said Charles A. Anderson,
a division vice president and general manager for General Dynamics.
   William B. Mitchell, DSEG president for Texas Instruments, said
his company doesn't expect things to get better soon.
   ``As we told stockholders at our annual meeting in April, we
expect defense markets to decline for at least the first half of the
1990s as the U.S. Department of Defense adjusts to the changing
world political environment,'' Mitchell said.
   TI employs about 22,000 people at its DSEG Texas plants in
Abilene, Austin, Lewisville, McKinney and Sherman, and at facilities
in Ridgecrest, Calif., and Colorado Springs, Colo.
   The TI cuts are the third in two years. Last year, 230 people
were laid off, then 240 more were cut earlier this year. Others also
took advantage of an early retirement program aimed at decreasing
staff numbers, but TI spokeswoman Terri West said the number of DSEG
employees involved was not available.
   Some of the TI employees may be given job elsewhere in the
Dallas-based company that manufactures and markets semiconductors,
defense electronics systems, software, computer systems and consumer
electronics products.
   ``We'll do several things to try to lessen the impact,'' Ms. West
said. ``That includes severance pay, extended insurance protection
and outplacement assistance.''
   Anderson said General Dynamics employees losing their jobs will
be notified in the coming weeks. The cutback in Fort Worth will
include both salaried and hourly employees, he said.
   Anderson had told division employees in April to expect a
``gradual reduction'' in employment this year as production of the
F-16, the U.S. Air Force's front-line fighter and a top
international arms export, slows down.
   The division general manager also said he expected that the
division's work force would be no larger than 25,000 by the
mid-1990s, meaning that about 7,000 jobs would be cut.
   So far this year, about 500 employees have been cut as work
schedules on the F-16 and the next generation Advanced Tactical
Fighter for the U.S. Air Force and the A-12 attack plane changed.
   More cutbacks are coming, Anderson said.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. said Friday it would post
complete nutritional information _ including fat and sodium levels _
on all of its products at its restaurants this summer.
   Terri Capatosto, a spokeswoman for the nation's biggest fast-food
restaurant chain, said the move was intended as a convenience for
McDonald's customers, not as a response to a recent ad campaign
attacking the nutritional value of the company's food.
   ``We've been providing complete nutrition information since
1973,'' she said. ``We've provided nutrition information in booklet
form since 1986.
   ``What we're trying to do now is make it as easy as possible for
customers to get information before they make a purchase at
McDonald's.''
   But Omaha industrialist Phil Sokolof, who has used advertising
and the news media to pressure a number of food companies to reduce
or remove saturated fats from their products, criticized the move
was ``window dressing.''
   Sokolof _ who blames a bad diet for a heart attack he suffered
years ago _ took out full-page ads in newspapers across the country
on April 4, calling on McDonald's to cut the amount of saturated fat
on its menu.
   McDonald's said Sokolof's ad _ which was headlined ``The
Poisoning of America'' _ was malicious and contained inaccurate and
misleading information.
   The company will post nutritional information posters on the
``customer side'' of its more than 8,200 restaurants, Capatosto
said. The posters will include nutrient values and complete
ingredient listings, she said.
   She said McDonald's wants to ensure that its customers receive
the information ``ahead of time so that they can make more informed

   But Sokolof complained that what needed to be done was reduce the
saturated fat content of McDonald's food.
   ``McDonald's affects the lives of millions of people a day,'' he
said. ``One simple step _ eliminating beef tallow from their french
fries _ could reduce the incidence of heart attacks in our country.''
   In recent years, McDonalds has developed a menu that includes
salads, 2 percent milk and bran muffins. It has said it is
experimenting with using pure vegetable oil _ rather than the
current beef shortening-vegetable oil mixture _ for frying its
french fries and hash browns.

   The stock market closed out its first losing week
since April with a broad decline Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 34.95 to
2,862.38, finishing the week with a net loss of 38.59 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
458 up, 1,010 down and 523 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.60 million
shares, against 160.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 176.30 million shares.
   Over the five preceding weeks the Dow Jones industrials had
rolled up an advance of 255.92 points.
   Analysts said the enthusiasm built up in the market's advance to
record highs as recently as Monday began to cool down as prices
pulled back a bit in the last few days.
   The upbeat mood was tempered by indications from the Federal
Reserve that it wasn't ready to adopt a more stimulative credit
policy on the basis of a few months of sluggish economic growth.
   That posed some questions about how much lower interest rates
might go in the immediate future after their sharp drop since late
April.
   Rates edged upward in the credit markets Friday, putting yields
on long-term Treasury bonds in the 8.44 percent-8.47 percent range.
   Financial stocks were mostly lower as enthusiasm about the
interest-rate outlook waned.
   In the money-center bank group, Bankamerica dropped { to 32;
Citicorp &lsqb; to 24; Manufacturers Hanover ~ to 36|; J.P. Morgan | to
37}, and Chemical Banking &lsqb; to 28&rsqb;.
   Mortgage issues also slipped. Federal Home Loan Mortgage fell 1&lsqb;
to 78{ and Federal National Mortgage { to 42&lsqb;.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak lost } to 41};
International Business Machines 1~ to 118}; Coca-Cola { to 44\;
General Electric } to 68{, and Philip Morris | to 44\.
   Conagra climbed 1\ to 33\ following word of the company's
agreement to acquire Beatrice Co. and its large stable of well-known
food brands from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   The Gap Inc. fell 2&rsqb; to 56&lsqb; on top of a 4&rsqb;-point drop Thursday
after analysts expressed disappointment with retail apparel sales
figures for May.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $30.03 billion, or 1.50
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.16 to 196.05.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 5.30 to 417.43, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 4.44 at 358.71.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.22 to 460.87. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 361.17, down 2.40.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices were sharply lower Friday on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid widespread stop-loss selling.
   On other markets, grain and soybeans were lower; livestock and
pork futures mixed; precious metals were mixed and energy futures
were higher.
   The cocoa futures market opened moderately lower, following the
London market's lead, but regained some ground before plunging due
to commission house selling.
   Judith Ganes, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said a
number of factors contributed to the market's selloff.
   She said the market rose recently because of concerns about the
political climate in the Ivory Coast, a major producer of cocoa. She
said the unstable conditions in that country have eased, largely
removing market concerns.
   Also weighing on cocoa futures was the settlement of the
Brazilian dock workers strike. Ms. Ganes noted that although the
strike had not prompted a rally in the market, the settlement
allowed the shipment of cocoa and gave those wanting to sell a
reason to do so.
   Cocoa settled $65 to $76 lower with the contract for delivery in
July at $1,235 a ton.
   Grain and soybean futures were lower in heavy trading the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Weather remains the key force driving the market, as forecasts
call for dry conditions for the corn and soybean crop producing
areas into next week with a return of wet conditions late in the
week, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Corn prices were pushed lower by profit-taking, with the market
ignoring planting delays and the possibility of yield losses from
late planting of fields.
   Soybean futures were pushed lower by pre-weekend liquidation and
professional selling.
   Soybeans also came under pressure from a concern that additional
acres will be planted in areas of the Midwest where corn planting
has been delayed.
   Soybeans can be planted in the southern Midwest into the first
week of July because they mature faster than corn.
   Wheat fell as traders shrugged off reports of disease ravaging
soft red winter wheat crops in the lower Midwest.
   Wheat was 4 cents lower to } cent higher July at $3.30} a bushel;
corn was 3 cents lower to a \ cent higher with July at $2.84} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $1.48\
a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with July at $6 a
bushel.
   Energy futures were mostly higher in trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil prices climbed on rumors that OPEC ministers will hold
an emergency meeting to discuss violations of production quotas,
said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   Short covering in advance of the weekend also contributed to the
modest gains in crude oil. Short covering occurs when traders buy
contracts so that they can fulfill earlier promises to sell.
   Gasoline futures were also higher, with trading shrugging off
concerns over the huge stocks of gasoline reported earlier in the
week, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 11 cents to 18 cents higher
with July at $16.78 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .31 cent
higher with July at 47.21 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.02
cents lower to .35 cent higher with July at 56.59 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures were mixed on New York's Commodity
Exchange.
   Gold was $1.10 to $1.40 higher with June at $355.70 a troy ounce;
silver was .60 cent to .70 cent lower with June at $5.007 a troy
ounce.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .52 cent higher with June at 75.60
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .40 cent higher
with August at 85.35 cents a pound; hogs were .67 cent lower to .15
cent higher with June at 64.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .35 cent to .83 cent higher with July at 67.75 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Cypress Semiconductor Signs Unique Pact With Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cypress Semiconductor Corp. said Friday
it plans to make computer chips and other electronic devices for the
Soviet Union in a unique licensing agreement that will give the
company Soviet chip-making technologies.
   Cypress signed a letter of intent with the International Center
for Informatics and Electronics of Moscow, which has officials
touring the Silicon Valley as part of a 10-day ``Silicon Summit.''
   T.J. Rodgers, president and chief executive officer of Cypress,
said the deal, which is still being developed, will be a good
technological marriage.
   The Soviets will provide semiconductor designs that Cypress would
modify for production in its manufacturing plants for sale to U.S.
customers. The Soviet chips involved are used for high-definition
television and sound and audio processing.
   Cypress does not currently make any products covered under the
agreement and views this as an opportunity to expand.
   Rodgers estimated it would be at least a year before Cypress
produces a sample chip from a Soviet design, but that
Soviet-designed chips could generate as much as $60 million per year
in sales for Cypress two or three years from now. Cypress revenues
from all sources were $199.3 million last year.
   The Soviets' main interest in the deal is not to gain access to
U.S. products, but to work with American companies to commercialize
and manufacture technology products that the Soviets are designing.
   The chips in the proposed Cypress deal are being designed by the
Soviet International Center for Informatics and Electronics, a
coalition of about 40 Soviet science and engineering organizations
set up to remove advanced-technology development from government
control.
   The Soviets have made advances in a semiconductor technology
known as submicron lithography, which can be used to produce
extremely dense silicon chips that could handle large volumes of
data quickly. The Soviets also developed advanced compounds to coat
magnetic disks in disk drives to make them faster, more reliable and
longer-lasting than U.S.-designed disk drives.
   But while the Soviets have developed these new technologies in
the laboratories, members of the delegation said they lack the
manufacturing capability to bring them to market as commercial
products.
   ``Our activity in research and development and microelectroncs
have produced new technologies and new technology equipment,'' said
Kamil Valiev, director of the Soviet Institute of Physics and
Technology. ``We have proposed to come to U.S. companies and have
them make commercial products from our technology. And we hope this
summit is the first step along the way.''
   Rodgers and key Cypress personnel will travel to Zelenograd,
considered the Silicon Valley of the Soviet Union, in July to
discuss the specific technologies and products under consideration.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Cypress would acquire the
advanced semiconductor fabrication technologies developed by the
Soviets and a license to manufacture some semiconductor products
designed by the Soviets.
   In return, Cypress would pay royalties to the Soviet Union, which
are still being negotiated. Cypress plans to deposit $100,000 in an
escrow account from which the Soviets can start to withdraw
royalties, Rodgers said.
   The Soviets signed the letter of intent after touring the Cypress
plant in San Jose Thursday in high style. The visitors arrived in
stretch limousines and were welcomed by a brass band, cheering
employees and American and Soviet flags flapping in the wind.
   ``As soon as we stepped into the plant and put on our (protective
white) suits, I realized we had opened doors here and that we would
sign an agreement today,'' Nicolai Kleschev, general director of the
Soviet's International Informatics Center, said through an
interpreter.
   The products that are being considered for manufacture under the
deal include chips for high definition television, digital signal
processing, telecommunications and audio and video products.
Cypress, a chip design, development and manufacture company,
currently doesn't make any of those products.
   ``This is a tremendous opportunity for Cypress,'' Rodgers said.
``Our philosophy is to grow through the addition of new products and
product lines. This agreement fits our needs perfectly. It also
meets the Soviets' needs. They require high quality process
technology, international marketing capabilities and support, as
well as negotiable currency _ all things we can provide.''
   Cypress makes programmable logic devices, memory programs and
other computer products.

<HEAD>John Hancock Agrees To Pay Forbes Insurance Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance policies designed to protect Malcolm
Forbes' estate from the taxman may have proved to be the bon vivant
businessman's last capitalist tool.
   Insurance companies that originally balked at paying millions of
dollars in claims to the estate have paid up, a Forbes official said
Friday.
   The late publisher of the business magazine dubbed ``capitalist
tool'' reportedly took out millions of dollars in life insurance
with different companies in the years preceding his death in
February at age 70.
   Forbes died of an apparent heart attack at Timberfield, his Far
Hills, N.J., mansion. But John Hancock Mutual Insurance Company last
month withheld payment on a multimillion-dollar policy pending an
investigation into the claim.
   Hancock officials had said only that an investigation was being
conducted, but published reports indicated medical information
provided by Forbes was being examined.
   But Hancock spokesman Richard Bevilacqua said the company had
completed its ``routine'' investigation and paid the claim.
   Forbes spokesman Don Garson said all pending insurance claims
have been paid to the Forbes estate.
   Neither spokesman would discuss the amounts of money involved,
but Garson said that the previously reported figure of $46 million
in total insurance claims was too low.
   ``Forbes is an exceptionally valuable property. That ($46
million) seems like a drop in the bucket,'' he said.
   Garson said Forbes often commented that the only way to pass on
an estate worth any money when he died was to have large amounts of
life insurance.
   Estimates of Forbes' estate range from $400 million to $1
billion. The estate would be taxed in the 55 percent brackets,
according to tax specialists. But much of Forbes' estate, such as
the magazine and his art collection, could not go on the auction
block to pay the government.
   Forbes' apparent solution was to take out insurance polices, some
within the last two years, to pay the necessary cash.
   Garson said no discrepancies were discovered in the medical
information Forbes provided to Hancock. ``I can assure you all
investigations have been completed. There were no irregularities ...
and the claims have all been paid,'' he said.
   Bevilacqua would not discuss the details of the agreement between
Hancock and the Forbes estate, which he said was concluded Tuesday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Down Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices dipped in light trading Friday as
many traders stayed on the sidelines awaiting several government
reports scheduled to be released next week.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5-32 point, or about
$1.56 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield, which rises when
prices fall, rose to 8.44 percent from late Thursday's 8.42 percent.
   Analysts said bond traders were just marking time as they waited
for the figures that will provide clues on the direction of the
economy and perhaps give some insight into the Federal Reserve's
credit policy.
   The Labor Department will issue wholesale and consumer price
figures for May, while the Commerce Department will announce retail
sales figures for May and trade deficit reports for the first
quarter and for April.
   If the figures indicate a slowing of the economy and inflation,
bond traders will be looking for some sign from the Fed that it will
relax credit, allowing interest rates to decline and bond prices to
rise.
   Some analysts say favorable figures could reignite the price
surge of June 1, when the Labor Department announced employment
figures that signaled a weakening of the economy.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to 1-16 point lower, intermediate
maturities were 1-32 point to 1-16 point lower and long-term issues
ranged from &lsqb; point to 5-32 point lower, according to Telerate Inc.,
the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.94 to 1,159.67.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 91}. The average yield to
maturity remained at 7.5 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.95
percent as the discount held steady at 7.70 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.03 percent as the discount advanced 4
basis points to 7.63 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.06
percent as the discount picked up 1 basis point to reach 7.51
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other
on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8\
percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Eastern Calls Back First Hard-Core Pilot Strikers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has for the first time recalled
pilots who stayed off the job until the end of the Air Line Pilots
Assocation strike, the company said Friday.
   They will be among 90 pilots called back to handle increased
summer schedules and a planned expansion of Atlanta routes, said
airline spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   Most of the 90 had volunteered to work before the end of the ALPA
strike in November, but the group also included some pilots who
refused to sign up until the eight-month job action officially ended.
   Ms. Ceremsak said the recalls were unrelated to ongoing
negotiations with ALPA in Washington and were instead based on the
airline's needs.
   Eastern ALPA spokesman E.J. Breen said the union had mixed
emotions about the action.
   ``It's terrific _ but we're disappointed that in seeking labor
peace, the management has screwed it up,'' Breen said.
   The union thought it had an agreement that pilots would be called
back by seniority, but instead Eastern went outside the seniority
lists, he said.
   ``They have only done it because they need us, and they've done
it in a confrontational way,'' Breen said.
   But he acknowledged there have been other positive signs. On
Friday, Eastern withdrew several New York court suits challenging
ALPA's right to represent the pilots.
   Ms. Ceremsak said another reason Eastern needs pilots is that
many currently flying to South America will need to be retrained
when those routes are turned over to American Airlines this summer.
No pilots will be laid off due to that change, she said.
   The returning pilots will not begin flying immediately. They must
be retrained under both airline and Federal Aviation Administration
rules and will have to pass physical exams.
   Before the recall, Eastern had 1,775 pilots flying about 800
flights a day, she said.
   The pilots aren't the first hard-core strikers to return. Ms.
Ceremsak said that among 440 flight attendants recalled since
Thanksgiving are employees who remained on strike until their union
agreed to return to work.
   The recalls do not affect the Machinists union, whose members
struck March 4, 1989, amid a contract impasse and rising hostilities
with Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. The
other two unions walked out in sympathy.
   Control of the airline was taken away from Lorenzo in April when
a bankruptcy court judge appointed current trustee Martin Shugrue
because creditors had lost confidence in the old management.
   Shugrue and the Machinists union have established a dialogue, but
there have been no details on their talks.

   Knoxville's morning and afternoon
newspapers, locked in a legal battle since January, agreed Friday to
dissolve their joint operating agreement by the end of December 1991.
   Owners of The Knoxville News-Sentinel and The Knoxville Journal
announced they had reached an agreement in principle to end their
4-year-old JOA.
   ``The parties expect to sign a definitive agreement by June 21,
1990, following notice to the Department of Justice,'' their
statement said.
   After the JOA ends, ``The Journal intends to publish separately
and in competition with The News-Sentinel,'' the statement said.
   The News-Sentinel is owned by The E.W. Scripps Co. of Cincinnati.
The morning paper has a daily circulation of 101,000 and a Sunday
circulation of 169,000.
   The Journal is owned by Persis Corp. of Honolulu, Hawaii. The
afternoon paper publishes Monday through Saturday with a circulation
of 40,000.
   Under the JOA, The News-Sentinel provides sales, production and
distribution for The Journal. Editorial departments of the two
newspapers are separate.
   The statement did not say where The Journal will publish after
1991.
   As part of the termination arrangement, The News-Sentinel will
pay Persis $40 million in two $20 million installments. The money
will be in lieu of payments The Journal would have received from
Dec. 31, 1991, through the scheduled end of the JOA on Dec. 31, 2005.
   The termination arrangement also will end litigation brought by
The News-Sentinel in Knox County Chancery Court against Persis in
January.
   The lawsuit alleged Persis violated the JOA terms when the Hawaii
company purchased The (Maryville) Daily Times in neighboring Blount
County in December. Journal editor and publisher Gerald Garcia also
was made the president and publisher of The Daily Times.
   The Daily Times publishes in the afternoon with a circulation of
21,000.
   However, The News-Sentinel, which recently began a zoned edition
in Maryville, considered The Daily Times a direct competitor.
   The lawsuit contended that with Garcia in the dual roles, The
Daily Times would have access to The News-Sentinel's confidential
business information and trade secrets.
   ``We are pleased with the agreement,'' said Thurston Twigg-Smith,
president and chief executive of Persis.
   ``Once we concluded that it was unlikely that the JOA would be
extended beyond 2005, we wanted to begin separate publication at a
time when The Journal was a strong and vital part of the Knoxville
community,'' he said.
   The News-Sentinel's agreement to pay Persis $40 million will
result in a charge to E.W. Scripp's second-quarter 1990 net income
of about $23 million, or 30 cents a share.
   ``This one-time payment is less than the expected amount The
News-Sentinel would have paid in distributions to The Journal had
joint operations continued through 2005,'' Scripps president and
chief executive Lawrence A. Leser said.
   ``We look forward to hardy economic competition in addition to
the fierce editorial competition that has existed between the two
newspapers for many years,'' Leser said.
   Until the termination in 1991, The News-Sentinel will continue to
act as agent on certain business matters for The Journal under a
special interim agreement that provides for The Journal's
``reasonable prospects for ongoing economic viability.''

   Ames Department Stores Inc., trying to
jettison unprofitable operations, announced plans to close 221
stores and lay off about 17,500 employees as it struggles to emerge
from bankruptcy protection.
   The closings, which represent nearly a third of Ames' 679 stores
nationwide, must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York, where the nation's fourth largest retailer filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankrutpcy laws on April 25.
   If the court approves, the company said Friday it plans to close
the stores in August or September after conducting inventory
liquidation sales.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he would not give
in to a key U.S. trade demand that Japan specify targets for
boosting its public works spending, a hoped-for wedge in opening the
market here to more foreign business.
   Kaifu's tough stand Friday, coming a day after a trade
breakthrough in which Japan accepted U.S. technology as a
cellular-phone standard, suggests the government intends to assert
itself despite heavy pressure for economic reform.
   Japan agreed in April to increase public spending as part of an
unprecedented pact to reduce its $49 billion trade surplus with the
United States by attacking trade barriers. The prime minister has
come under harsh criticism in Parliament for bowing to U.S. demands.

   Terri Capatosto, a spokeswoman for the nation's biggest fast-food

for McDonald's customers, not as a response to a recent ad campaign
attacking the nutritional value of the company's food.

   A Texas businessman stung in a federal
crackdown on child labor law violations cautioned Congress against
letting ``governmental paternalism'' ruin worthwhile work
opportunities for youngsters.
   Donald Farrell said Friday that jobs like those he provides give
youngsters, especially those from unstable homes, a chance to earn
money, experience and self-respect. His Dallas business is under
investigation for allegedly letting nearly 300 children illegally
sell newspaper subscriptions at night.
