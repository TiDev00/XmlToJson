<HEAD>Baker Concerned About Iranian Call for `Holy War'</HEAD>

expansion of embargo against Iraq and possible sanctions for

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
voiced concern Thursday about the call from Iran's spiritual leader
for a ``holy war'' against the U.S. troops deployed to Saudi
Arabia.
   Baker, here for talks Friday with Syrian President Hafez Assad
on the campaign against Iraq, said Wednesday's comments by
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Iranian spiritual leader, were
``obviously of deep concern.''
   ``We are not indifferent to threats against our forces,'' the
secretary said.
   Baker noted that Arab forces were also part of the Persian Gulf
operation intended to guard against further Iraqi aggression.
Syria, which is on Iraq's northern border, has sent 3,000 troops to
Saudi Arabia and 1,000 to the United Aab Emirates.
   As for continued Iranian adherence to the U.N. economic embargo
against Iraq, Baker told reporters, ``We are watching it closely
and believe it is holding.''
   During his talks in Moscow, Baker told Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze the United States may ask the United Nations to
broaden the embargo against Iraq, including possibly a cutoff of
air shipments, according to reports in The Washington Post and The
New York Times. Baker also mentioned the possibility of seeking
U.N. sanctions against nations that break the embargo.
   In Washington, meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Khamenei's ``position appears to be based on a
misunderstanding of what we mean. ...''
   The United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia at the
government's invitation to deter Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
from attacking the oil-rich kingdom, he said.
   ``And we will leave Saudi Arabia when that mission is
accomplished or whenever we might be asked to leave by the Saudi
government,'' Boucher added.
   Officials in Washington who have analyzed Khamenei's speech are
said to feel the Iranian cleric was expressing the fears of his
country and those of others in the area that the United States will
use its foothold in Saudi Arabia to stay forever.
   ``This is our way of allaying those concerns,'' said one
Washington official who requested anonymity.
   On Wednesday, Khamenei said that ``confronting the greedy
interventionist schemes of the United States to encroach on the
Persian Gulf is considered Jihad (holy war), and anyone who is
killed on the path is a martyr.''
   The Bush administration had solicited both Syria and Iran to
assist in the Iraqi campaign because of the two nations'
longstanding hostility to Saddam's government.
   While Iran has repaired relations with Iraq, with which it
fought an eight-year war that ended just two years ago, the Tehran
government has endorsed the U.N. boycott.
   Baker is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit Syria since
George P. Shultz came here in 1988 to sound out Assad on the
prospects for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Syria's human rights record has been sharply criticized by the
State Department, which has kept Assad's government on a list of
seven countries accused of sponsoring terrorism.
   A terrorist group with strong ties to Syria, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, is suspected in
the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie,
scotland. The disaster took 280 lives.
   Baker, in announcing Monday in Brussels that he would visit
Damascus, said the United States continues ``to have certain
differences with Syria and we expect to discuss these differences
as well as our mutual interest in continuing to see Saddam Hussein
isolated.''
   He said his face-to-face meeting with Assad was important so
that ``we might be able to cooperate to achieve what happens to be
a mutual goal.''

action from the Vietnam War, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
   The action Thursday was the largest return of remains since 28
sets were handed over June 21, 1989, and part of a continuing
effort to resolve the fates of Americans who did not return from
the war.
   Spokesman James Williams said the remains were being flown from
Hanoi to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and Army Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii where they are to be analyzed.
   The Pentagon lists 2,300 Americans as missing in action, or MIA,
in Southeast Asia: 1,677 in Vietnam, 534 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia
and six in Chinese coastal waters.

<TEXT>
   Giancarlo Pajetta, a leader of the anti-Fascist
resistance in World World II and longtime Communist Party official,
has died at the age of 79.
   The party said Pajetta died at his home Wednesday night of
cardiac arrest.
   The Turin-born Pajetta was known as the ``red youth'' for his
early political leanings. At the age of 14, he was arrested and
sent to reform school for distributing anti-Fascist literature.
   Pajetta was imprisoned for 10 years during the war, and upon
release in 1943 took up the fight against occupying German troops.
   He served as a Communist Party deputy in Parliament from 1946
until his death and was one of the party's foreign affairs
specialists.
   Friends said Pajetta was particularly troubled by the recent
split in the party over proposals to drop Communist from the name.
   ``This is the worst moment in my political life,'' he said in an
interview earlier this week.
   He is survived by his wife and three children.

   Portugal will hold a presidential
election Jan. 13, a spokesman for President Mario Soares has
announced.
   A second round between the two leading candidates will be held
Feb. 13 if none obtains more than 50 percent in the first round.
   Soares, elected in 1986, is widely expected run again but has
yet to announce his candidature. His term expires in March.
   Soares is a former leader of the Socialist Party, now the main
opposition to the center-right Social Democratic Party of Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva.
   January's poll will be the fourth presidential election since a
1974 revolution restored Portugal to democracy after a 48-year
ultraconservative dictatorship.
   Cavaco Silva is due to defend his parliamentry majority in
legislative elections due later in 1991.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dead dolphins are washing up on Spain's
eastern Mediterranean coast in unusually high numbers, causing
marine biologists and ecologists to suspect a viral epidemic is
killing them.
   Many scientists and environmental activists believe the deaths
are the inevitable outcome of large-scale dumping of toxic
pollutants in the Mediterranean by petrochemical plants.
   Esteve Grau, a University of Barcelona biologist, said
preliminary results of autopsies on three of the dead mammals
showed extremely high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
   ``We're working on the hypothesis that the dolphins ate
PCB-contaminated fish and that this severely weakened their immune
systems, making them susceptible to a still-unidentified virus,''
Grau said in a telephone interview.
   PCBs are liquid, resinous or crystalline organic compounds used
in industrial processes as lubricants, heat-transfer fluids or to
give strength or flexibility to wood, metal or concrete.
   ``We believe the scientists' hypothesis to be correct,'' said
Xavier Pastor, head of the Greenpeace environmental group's office
in Palma, capital of the Spanish island of Majorca in the
Mediterranean.
   He said the toxicity of PCBs and their resistance to
decomposition make them especially dangerous to mammals.
   ``The epidemic appears similar to others that killed up to 800
seals in the North Sea off the Netherlands in 1988 and in another
case under study in California,'' Pastor said.
   He said some of the dead dolphins had been found on beaches near
Palma, in the Balearic archipelago 150 miles south of Barcelona.
   Grau and other scientists from the Barcelona Zoo, the Marineland
Aquatic Park and the University of Valencia have conducted 10
autopsies on dolphins. They are trying to determine why only
striped dolphin, and not fish, have been killed, he said.
   Dr. Joaquim Piza of Marineland said doubts remained about
whether PCBs caused the dolphins to die.
   ``If that were the case, it's most likely dolphins of other
species would have been affected,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   ``The autopsies have not produced conclusive evidence that the
PCBs are the cause. The only thing we have been able to determine
so far with certainty is that the dolphins suffered a weakening of
their immune systems.''
   Piza said there was some speculation the dolphins had contracted
a herpes-type virus that attacked their immune systems.
   Between 12 and 20 infirm or aged striped dolphins are found
washed up every summer on Spain's eastern beaches and on Majorca,
Grau said, but there have been more than 100 this year. He said the
striped dolphin is not an endangered species and is abundant in the
Mediterranean.
   Scientists fear the presence of PCBs eventually may reduce the
number of dolphins by affecting reproduction in addition to killing
the weaker ones, Grau said.
   ``We estimate that only 1 percent of affected dolphins have
washed up,'' he said, ``which means the total number that have
succumbed to the viral epidemic could be as high as 10,000.''
   Pastor noted that industrial and chemical companies continue
dumping tons of toxic waste, including PCBs, into the Mediterranean
from plants along Spain's Mediterranean coast from Barcelona to
Algeciras, adjacent to Gibraltar.
   ``We've called on Spain's autonomous regional governments and
the central government in Madrid to set up a plan to gradually, but
definitively, end all industrial toxic waste dumping into the
Mediterranean by the end of 1991,'' he said.
   ``We've tried to work with industrial companies directly, but
they have refused to acknowledge how much they dump into the
Mediterranean, saying it might reveal industrial secrets to
competitors.''
   He said Greenpeace had found it difficult to develop estimates
of the amount of PCBs companies in Spain dump into the
Mediterranean.

<HEAD>Diabetes-Related Enzyme Identified; May Lead to Prevention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported identifying a target
of an immune system attack that precedes diabetes, a discovery that
could help in predicting and someday even preventing the disease.
   The target is an enzyme in the insulin-producing cells of the
pancreas, researchers said in the British journal Nature.
   ``This really is exciting stuff. ... I think clearly it will be
one of the major papers in diabetes in the last several years,''
said Kenneth Farber, director of research at the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation International.
   His organization helped fund the research.
   The study dealt with insulin-dependent diabetes, the most severe
form, which affects about 1 million Americans. They must take daily
insulin injections to survive.
   Symptoms appear after the body's disease-fighting immune system
has destroyed most of the insulin-producing beta cells of the
pancreas.
   Scientists do not know what triggers that onslaught. But they
have found that the immune system begins attacking several specific
targets long before the disease is diagnosed.
   The new study identifies one of those targets as an enzyme
called glutamic acid decarboxylase. The substance is also found in
brain cells, where it helps make a chemical messenger brain cells
use to communicate, researcher Steinunn Baekkeskov said.
   The discovery should aid research into the substance by leading
to much more abundant supplies of it, either from brain tissue or
from genetic engineering, she said.
   Further research on the enzyme may lead to therapies that
prevent diabetes by stopping the immune system attack without
suppressing the immune system generally, she said.
   But that depends on whether the attack on the enzyme plays any
role in causing the disease, which is not yet known, said
Baekkeskov, of the Hormone Research Institute of the medical school
at the University of California at San Francisco.
   She did the work with colleagues at the institute and scientists
at the Yale University School of Medicine and in Denmark.
   Other future research can follow up indications that a blood
test based on the enzyme can help identify people on the way to
developing diabetes, she said.
   The test looks for antibodies that are aimed at the enzyme. The
antibodies appear in 80 percent of newly diagnosed diabetics, and
they have been detected up to several years before symptoms of the
disease appear, researchers said.
   Antibodies to other targets appear before diagnosis, too. Dr.
George Eisenbarth of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said
combining the enzyme antibody test with other antibody tests may
improve the ability to predict insulin-dependent diabetes.
   Currently there is no proven way to prevent the disease in
people who show diabetes-related antibodies. But Eisenbarth said
early prediction is useful in finding people to participate in
studies of therapies to prevent the disease.
   The American Diabetes Association recently endorsed blood tests
for close relatives of insulin-dependent diabetics to help find
participants for such studies.

   Heads up, 265th! You're shipping out
tomorrow. Stand down, 265th. You're not going anywhere for a week.
Hang in there, 265th. You'll be gone by the weekend.
   To the military novice, such conflicting statements could be a
source of confusion, frustration _ even anger. But for veterans of
the 265th Quartermaster Detachment there is a simple philosophy to
handle this world of uncertainty.
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' said Sgt. Earnest Deloach.
His sentiment drew a murmur of ``That's the truth'' from the rest
of the 14-member National Guard unit from South Carolina awaiting
deployment to the Mideast.
   While information about the 265th's departure date may change
from hour to hour, there are signs that it will be sooner than
later.
   The unit has been placed on Available Loading Date status, which
means it could be shipped out at any time.
   The men are ready. They wear their desert uniforms and canteens
everywhere. The forest green camouflage on their four pickup trucks
has been painted over a flat sand color.
   Nearly everyone has had his hair trimmed to military stubble.
Many of the haircuts were courtesy of Sgt. Hullie Cohen, a brick
mason who has cut his family's hair since he was a boy.
   But for all the omens that departure is imminent, there are
signs that the 265th still faces an uncertain wait.
   On Wednesday the men finished packing four trucks with items for
overseas, ranging from toilet paper and cots to radios and spare
radiators. They took the 45-mile drive to the Hunter Army Air Field
to have their loads prepared for airlift.
   But a major at the field told them to take it back.
   ``I have no orders on what airframe will be taking you,'' he
said. ``I have no indication when you might be going. It might be
another week.''
   So the convoy made the 45-mile return trip to the barracks.
   When they got back, there was a call from a colonel. ``You're
leaving tomorrow afternoon,'' the unit commander, Sgt. Ronnie
Jackson, was told.
   When the information was passed down through the sergeants to
the enlisted men, the reaction was a sort of angry yawn and an
unprintable phrase often heard around here to express disbelief.
   ``They tell you one thing and they tell you another and you
don't know which to believe,'' said Spc. Curtis Young.
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' echoed a chorus of the men.
   The problem in all this uncertainty is its impact on morale. The
unit has finished an arduous schedule of chemical warfare training
to lessons on Saudi etiquette. There is little else to do but sit
around and brood or go over lessons for the 20th time.
   ``We're all revved up and ready to go,'' said Sgt. John
Williams, the second in command. ``If we have to wait another week,
it will kill us.''
   Jackson, the unit commander, has tried to maintain a balance
with the men. He kept them working through the afternoon, repacking
the trucks, packing their own gear and going down for their last
set of shots.
   But he canceled an evening physical training session, giving the
men time to spend with family members who made the three-hour drive
from the unit's home of Allendale, S.C.
   ``I'm backing off,'' Jackson said. ``With all this uncertainty,
you've got to know when to leave them alone.''
   Among the visiting families were Cohen's wife and daughter. The
Cohens weren't coming until the weekend, but plans changed late in
the day.
   Did that mean Cohen thought deployment was tomorrow?
   ``No,'' he said, ``but I couldn't take the chance.''

<DATELINE>SHAALAN III CAMP, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Mr. Jim's hellish busy,''
warned a Jordanian volunteer at this crowded desert camp. Jim
Nuttall, awake and unfed since who knows when, was up to his neck
in remonstrating refugees.
   Nuttall, a gentle but street-wise guy from Detroit, is the
roving troubleshooter for Save the Children of Westport, Conn. He's
found plenty of trouble on the desolate, desperate Iraqi border.
   ``Only one?'' Nuttall said with a laugh when asked his biggest
problem in building from scratch a transit camp for thousands of
penniless Asians unable to get home from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   After two weeks of laboring every day from dawn to
after-midnight, interrupted every few minutes with some minor
crisis to defuse, Nuttall had shifted to yet another gear.
   ``Now it comes down to the hard work,'' he said. ``We're almost
building a city out here: sanitation, food systems, communication,
control, mosques, water supplies. It's a 12-ring circus.''
   Nuttall, 37, started out with a degree in sculpture from Wayne
State University in Detroit. His father, Garth L. Nuttall, runs a
machine shop in the city.
   Nuttall worked in Morocco for the Peace Corps in 1980, then went
into the disaster business.
   Two weeks ago, Nuttall was the first outsider to wade into
Shaalan I, where 40,000 stranded refugees were working themselves
into a frenzy of despair. Violence did not seem far off.
   One man roughed him up. A desperate mob carried off an Indian
volunteer until Nuttall managed to rescue him.
   Unscathed, he coordinated the Jordanian Army and relief workers.
Working with officials, he organized the refugees into national
groups and separated them.
   ``It wasn't so bad,'' Nuttall shrugged, with a self-deprecating
chuckle. ``My last job was doing the same thing on the Afghanistan
border in Pakistan, and they were all armed.''
   By Tuesday, he had brought some order to Shaalan III, a hastily
planned settlement designed to ease crowding at Shaalan I and the
smaller, calmer Shaalan II. He had even attempted a Bengali Night,
a curry cookout to raise spirits of Bangladeshis spending their
second week among scorpions and snakes with no word on when their
impoverished government might fly them home.
   ``What a disaster,'' he said. ``Have you ever tried to cook rice
for 5,000 people?''
   The stoves didn't work, delaying dinner until after dark. The
electricity was not in, so the party was by candlelight. Trucks
suddenly arrived with more people, spewing thick dust everywhere.
   A kindly Jordanian farmer drove up with a load of gift
vegetables, but his truck broke down. The party fizzled while hosts
played mechanic.
   But the worst part was the buses headed west from Shaalan I.
From all evidence, they were evacuating people who had arrived at
the camp later than those in Nuttall's camp.
   ``They went nuts,'' he said. ``They gathered together and were
saying things like, `This is a prison camp.' I told them the buses
were carrying Filipinos, but these are frustrated people.''
   All the next day, Nuttall fended off flak while trying to solve
the problem. He got military guards posted on the two-lane road
outside to make sure no one violated the first-in, first-out rule.
   With a masters in culture management from the School of
International Training at Brattleboro, Vermont, and what he calls
his social worker's voice, he calmed tensions.
   But Mohammed Sana Ullah got to him. With firmness bordering on
threat, the retired air force sergeant demanded some action.
Nuttall tried a trusty tack.
   ``Listen, I want to help you go home so that I can go home,'' he
said. ``Please help me to help you.''
   Ullah then broke into sobs, and Nuttall's own frayed nerves
nearly went. Moisture formed in his eyes as he sought to sooth
Ullah. Then, another crisis intervened, and he was off again.
   The next morning, Nuttall woke up seeing Ullah's eyes in his
mind and hurried to Amman to press Bangladeshi consular authorities
to speed up evacuations.
   Nuttall has set a furious pace from his first day here. After
three days on the border, having eaten almost nothing and badly
dehydrated, he refused to tap the refugees' meager stocks. Friends
brought him a midnight meal, which he let sit for an hour while he
reeled off sound bites by long-distance phone to American networks
to dramatize the refugees' plight.
   Ten days later, a visitor to Shaalan III asked Nuttall how he
was able to remain in such good spirits.
   ``No problem,'' he replied. ``I had a shower this morning.''

   For Karima Bennoune, an Algerian student at the
University of Michigan, the frustrations and fears of being an Arab
on an American campus came to a head during a recent law school
class.
   ``A student stood up,'' she recalled, ``and said there is
nothing in the Middle East worth anything except oil, and that we
should go in there and do whatever we want, which to me is a pretty
amazing statement from a first-year law student at the University
of Michigan.''
   ``That typifies a lot of the attitude on campus,'' she said.
``They've forgotten that there are men, women and children being
affected by the blockade. When I see Arab people waiting in lines
for bread or medicine, I see people who look like my cousins. But
others just see the face of the madman Saddam Hussein.''
   Through the eyes of Bennoune and many of the estimated 30,000
other Arab-American and Arab national students, U.S. campuses this
fall are places of uncertainty and anxiety _ safe havens, for now
at least, from the Persian Gulf crisis affecting their homelands,
yet vulnerable to bigotry.
   ``I was here in 1979. I remember what it was like for Iranian
students during the hostage crisis,'' said Haneen, a 28-year-old
Lebanese student attending Columbia University who asked that her
last name be withheld for fear of reprisals to family living in
Kuwait.
   ``And you didn't have to be an Arab student to be mistaken for
one.''
   So far this young school year, students attending American
universities from Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Kuwait,
Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have not faced serious bigotry
or hostility, according to Marvin Wingfield, outreach director of
the Washington-based Arab-American Anti-discrimination Committee,
which tracks such incidents.
   ``On the contrary, everybody's been concerned about me and
everybody's been treating me well,'' said Rafeef Zahran, a
psychology student and the only Saudi attending Emmanuel College, a
small, Catholic, all women's school in Boston.
   But interviews with Arab students elsewhere reveal that many,
like Bennoune, see signs that campus life could grow increasingly
uncomfortable as the Persian Gulf crisis wears on _ especially if
it escalates into war.
   At the Michigan campus, for example, Bennoune says she's seen a
number of students wearing Ghostbuster-type T-shirts with the word
``Iraq'' encircled and slashed.
   Nearly all complained that Americans are generally unsympathetic
to the suffering of Arabs and have wrongly painted the Persian Gulf
conflict as simply good versus evil.
   Saddam Hussein himself had little support from the Arab students
interviewed.
   ``I couldn't name an Arab student who supports Saddam Hussein.
But there's a lot of sympathy for the Iraqi people, and there's a
lot of feeling about the Americans charging in militarily,'' said
Bennoune.
   Other students expressed equal contempt for the Saudi and
Kuwaiti regimes, which they accuse of intolerance toward other
Arabs.
   ``I don't consider Saddam Hussein to be the savior of the Arabs,
but the Kuwaitis have brought this on themselves,'' says Wael
Massarweh, a 28-year-old Jordanian engineering student at Texas A&amp;M
University.
   Massarweh and his family lived and worked in Kuwait until last
year and he said Arabs from other lands often suffered
discrimination.
   ``If you think South Africa is bad in terms of discrimination,
that's the worst. For Palestinians, Lebanese or others who work
there, there is no respect for human rights. If you are in a car
accident, and one party is Kuwaiti and the other is an Arab from
elsewhere, the Kuwaiti is always right,'' he said.
   ``As a student, as a Moslem, as an Arab, I don't approve of
Saddam Hussein pointing guns at other Arabs,'' said Osman Ghandour,
a second-year graduate engineering student at Columbia who grew up
in Lebanon's war-torn Bekaa Valley.
   ``I was educated in the United States. We think very highly of
democracy and freedom. It's disappointing that the U.S. should make
more of an effort for Kuwait, but not for the Palestinians.''
   An added frustration among some is a desire to speak out on
campus, but a fear of the consequences.
   ``We can't afford to lie low,'' said Haneen, who said she and
fellow Arab students hope to bring guest speakers to Columbia this
fall.

   As the Persian Gulf crisis wears on, Israeli
leaders are sending ambiguous messages to Jordan. They say publicly
that they want King Hussein to remain in power, but insist
privately that his days as a ruler are numbered.
   Some analysts say the mixed messages are a sign of confusion in
the Israeli government, while others say Israel is delivering a
warning to the king not to go too far in supporting Iraq.
   Still others warn that the tough talk may be intended to create
an aggressive political mood in Israel, laying the groundwork for
an Israeli invasion of neighboring Jordan should the opportunity
arise.
   ``Private conversations in certain influential Israeli circles
betray eagerness for an Israeli invasion of Jordan,'' liberal
Israeli journalist Uri Avnery wrote in a recent commentary in The
New York Times.
   ``There is tough-guy talk of lowering the threshold for an
Israeli military action. The tone is `Make our day','' wrote
Avnery, a former member of Parliament.
   An Israeli-held Jordan would appeal to extreme hard-liners who
dream of a ``Greater Israel'' on both banks of the Jordan River,
Avnery said. It would also fit in with the plans of those who want
to expel Palestinains from the West Bank and need a place to
resettle them, he added.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
called Avnery's scenario as ``utter nonsense.
   ``What would we do with Jordan?'' Pazner asked.
   He added that Shamir ``is interested in the king's survival
because he believes we need a stable, peaceful Jordan alongside us.
The king is best equipped to deliver this.''
   Pazner also said there was nothing ambiguous about Israel's
stance toward Jordan. He noted that since Iraq precipitated the
crisis by seizing Kuwait last month, Israel has said it would only
use military force if attacked by Iraq or if Iraqi troops entered
Jordan.
   But Shamir himself has suggested that the Israeli threshold for
moving into Jordan may be lower than the officially stated policy.
   Asked recently to comment on Jordan's expressions of sympathy
for Iraq, Shamir said it ``is contrary to Israel's interests,
threatens Israel's security and does not help the king's survival.''
   He quickly tempered the warning, adding: ``The king of Jordan
knows well that Israel has no aggressive intentions toward it
(Jordan).''
   But King Hussein apparently believes otherwise, having heard for
yement that ``Jordan is Palestine.''
   This theory holds that Jordan, with its 50 percent Palestinian
population, is the true Palestinian homeland. This idea has Israel
keeping the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured
from Jordan and Egypt in 1967 and which Palestinians want as their
would-be state.
   Influential members of Shamir's right-wing government have
frequently used the phrase ``Jordan is Palestine.'' Chief among
them is Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who once suggested Israel
contact the PLO to help it take over Jordan.
   Last week, the independent Israeli newspaper Haaretz wrote that
it was such talk, seen as a threat by Jordan, that pushed King
Hussein into the arms of Iraq.
   The king's dependence on Iraq also has led Israeli analysts to
question lately whether he is really valuable to Israel.
   ``Shamir is not sure whether it's better to have a Palestinian
state in Jordan or whether to have King Hussein,'' said Yossi
Melman, a journalist who wrote a book on the secret ties between
two countries despite their official state of war.
   Melman said King Hussein's value to the Israelis as a moderate
leader is diminishing rapidly, though they apparently still prefer
him to Palestinians or Moslem fundamentalists.
   But a source knowledgeable about government policies, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said most Israeli leaders have concluded
that King Hussein is no longer of use to them.
   His usefulness suffered its worst blow when he renounced claims
to the West Bank in 1988, losing his role as possible mediator
between Israel and the Palestinians.
   On Sunday, The Jerusalem Post's military reporter quoted a
``very senior source'' as predicting the king would be toppled.
   ``I am not saying that Jordan will disappear as a state,'' the
source told the Post. ``But Jordan as a kingdom, as a country ruled
by a king (will disappear).''

<TEXT>
   The tiny band of voters who shaped the 1990
primary election season sent a clear message: beware of jumping to
any conclusions about the mood of the electorate this year.
   Consider these bits of conventional wisdom widely circulated in
1990:
   _Public concern about a squishy economy and anger over the
savings and loan scandal have created an anti-incumbent mood.
``Throw the rascals out,'' will be the battle cry of voters.
   _The 1989 Supreme Court decision giving states latitude to
restrict access to abortion changed the impact of that issue
decisively in favor of candidates who support abortion rights.
   But the only rascal thrown out in a primary was Rep. Donald
``Buz'' Lukens, an Ohio Republican who had been convicted of having
sex with a minor.
   Others seemed threatened _ most recently, Gov. Rudy Perpich of
Minnesota and Rep. Roy Dyson of Maryland. But both Democrats turned
back primary challenges on Tuesday. And a month ago, Republican
Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas won a primary he was widely expected to
lose.
   The Perpich and Dyson victories also defied the conventional
assumptions on abortion. Both incumbents were in the anti-abortion
camp and defeated challengers who were pro-choice.
   Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women, contended that Perpich's victory was not a
clear test of abortion sentiment because the governor's running
mate was a pro-choice woman and he was considered very supportive
of women on other issues.
   ``It was not a clear up-or-down vote, although, of course, if we
had won it we would have been much happier,'' she said.
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown, when asked about an
anti-incumbent trend, said, ``I haven't seen any.''
   ``There's some sign of that, but not a prairie fire,'' said
Charles Black, the leading spokesman for the Republican Party.
   Both party officials claimed they were pleased with the
candidates who have emerged from the primaries. After Tuesday's
elections in 10 states and the District of Columbia, only a handful
of states have yet to hold their primaries.
   ``I wish the general election was tomorrow,'' said Brown.
   ``We're happy with the nominees that we've got,'' said Black. He
also said he was delighted that the Democrats had renominated
Perpich, whom the Republicans consider one of the most vulnerable
incumbents.
   In several other states, Democratic primary voters tossed aside
the assumptions of party leaders and arguably strengthened the
party's ticket.
   Most prominent among those was California, where the party
establishment was strongly behind state Attorney General John Van
de Kamp for the gubernatorial nomination. But Van de Kamp also was
widely viewed as a certain underdog in a contest against Republican
Sen. Pete Wilson.
   Party leaders gave former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein
little chance to sidetrack Van de Kamp's drive for the nomination.
But she won the primary going away and is in a dead-heat race with
Wilson.
   In Kansas, Democratic leaders assumed former Gov. John Carlin
was their strongest challenger to Hayden. But the voters clearly
saw Carlin as part of the state's economic problems and gave the
Democratic statehouse nomination to state Treasurer Joan Finney.
   Florida Democratic primary voters overwhelmingly backed former
Sen. Lawton Chiles over the early establishment choice, Rep. Bill
Nelson, for governor.
   Harvey Gantt is running a close race against Republican Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, had been given little chance last spring of beating
prosecutor Mike Easley in a runoff.
   The latest round of primaries was particularly tough on
assumptions about the impact of abortion.
   Not only did Perpich and Dyson successfully defy the
conventional wisdom, but the issue failed to make a perceptible
dent in the victory margins in New Hampshire of Rep. Bob Smith and
Sen. Gordon Humphrey.
   Try as he might, lawyer Tom Christo failed to make abortion an
issue in the Republican Senate primary in which he and Smith
competed for the nomination to succeed Humphrey.
   Humphrey, surrendering his U.S. Senate seat and seeking a seat
in the New Hampshire Senate, overcame a primary challenge from a
state legislator who had strong backing from the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   ``There's no one we'd rather beat than Gordon Humphrey,'' said
NARAL's Peg Dobbie. Despite NARAL's best efforts, the senator
captured 58 percent of the primary vote.
   But pro-choice advocates also had races they could cite to
support their view of the impact of the abortion issue. Three
Maryland state senators who led a filibuster against abortion
rights legislation were defeated by pro-choice primary challengers.
   ``What we learned from the primary season is that abortion is
not necessarily a silver bullet in every race,'' said NARAL
executive director Kate Michelman. ``It can be powerful, but ...
it's not going to make every candidate a winner.''

<HEAD>Limited Televising of Federal Court Proceedings Approved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans, accustomed to watching presidents
and members of Congress on television, will get their first
televised look at federal judges at work next year.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, which sets policy for the federal
courts, approved on Wednesday a carefully controlled and limited
plan to permit TV cameras to record and broadcast civil trials in a
handful of federal courtrooms.
   The three-year experiment will begin in July, limited to two
federal appeals courts and six trial courts. Judges who volunteer
their courtrooms for the plan will have almost total control over
what the public sees.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., who has been urging approval
of the experiment, hailed the Judicial Conference action as a step
toward promoting public understanding of the court system.
   ``The time for federal courts to permit TV news coverage in
courtrooms has come,'' said Kastenmeier, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on courts. ``Technology that permits us
access to world events also compels us to use that access to make
our own government available to our citizens.''
   Kastenmeier said televised congressional proceedings, which
began in the House in 1979 and in 1986 in the Senate, have been
beneficial to the public.
   C-Span, the cable network that telecasts public affairs
programs, also welcomed the experiment and predicted it will
enhance respect for America's system of justice.
   The Judicial Conference, headed by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, approved the idea overwhelmingly by voice vote, said
spokesman David Sellers.
   Sellers indicated that Rehnquist spoke in favor of the
experiment.
   The conference, with 27 federal judges as its members,
traditionally meets in private.
   Sellers said only a few judges spoke against the experiment and
that ``the pervasive view is this is inevitable.''
   Forty-five states have approved the use of television cameras,
and supporters say there have been no adverse results.
   Wednesday's action does not mean that federal criminal trials
will be televised. The Judicial Conference left intact a rule
banning cameras in criminal cases.
   Nor will Supreme Court proceedings be televised anytime soon.
The Judicial Conference has no control over the high court, and
most justices are believed opposed to permitting cameras there.
   Some justices reportedly were turned against the idea after
watching Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork get roughed up verbally
at televised confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary
Committee in 1987. Bork subsequently was rejected by the Senate.
   For years, then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger played a leading
role in keeping cameras out of federal courtrooms.
   Cameras and radio sound equipment have been banned in federal
courts since 1937.
   Those who oppose lifting the ban say television will lead to
grandstanding by judges and lawyers and could distort public
understanding because only snippets will be aired on TV news
programs.
   Sellers said three or four judges raised those objections at the
Judicial Conference meeting.
   He said the new experiment will be monitored by the Federal
Judicial Center, a think tank for the federal courts. It will issue
a report on its findings in September 1993 or March 1994.
   The Judicial Conference approved a recommendation by a study
committee that voted 4-1 in favor of the idea for federal courts
last month. The committee is headed by U.S. District Judge Robert
F. Peckham of San Francisco.
   One item judges will insist on is that those who operate TV
cameras will be dressed in business attire. ``No jumpsuits,'' said
Sellers.

   Until Steve Martin and Jay Leno
arrive to entertain the troops, the best _ and only show _ in town
is strictly for amateurs.
   Wednesday was opening night for a rocking, risque 90-minute show
put on by Americans and other Westerners _ men and women _ who live
in Saudi Arabia and wanted to show their appreciation to the U.S.
troops sent to protect them.
   And despite their amateur status, they got rave reviews.
   ``You don't know how good I feel,'' said Gil Vargas, of the 82nd
Airborne Division, who was stamping his feet to the closing number,
a rap version of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.''
   The performers repeatedly brought nearly 400 members of the 82nd
Airborne to their feet with a variety show of singing, dancing,
comedy, rock music and flag-waving.
   For the paratroops, who have been living in the Saudi desert for
a month, the show broke the tedium.
   ``It was great stress relief,'' said 19-year Army veteran Master
Sgt. Ervin Shelley of Greenville, N.C. ``My only regret is that
some of the guys out there won't get to see the show. This means a
lot to the guys.''
   The Americans, Britons and other Westerners who staged the show
reside and work near several camps housing U.S. troops. They hope
to put on the show three times a week for the next few weeks.
   A burlesque-like dance routine opened the show and got the
soldiers hooting and hollering.
   An act billed as a barbershop quartet actually had 15 members,
but the men __ and a few women paratroopers _ didn't seem to mind,
joining in on some of the songs.
   The troops, who get a few newspapers in the desert but have
little contact with the outside world, were bent over laughing at a
series of jokes told by a stand-up comic about the gulf crisis _
none of them repeatable.
   ``My name is Bob but I'm beyond hope,'' was the comic's opening
line.
   It's not known yet whether the 87-year-old Bob Hope, who's made
a practice of bringing laughter to U.S. troops since World War II,
will make the trip to Saudi Arabia for one of his famed Christmas
shows.
   But that wild and crazy guy, Steve Martin, is scheduled to
arrive next month, accompanied by his wife, actress Victoria
Tennant. And Leno has been lined up for two Thanksgiving shows
sponsored by the USO.
   The United Service Organization's morale-building has gotten off
to a slow start because priority has been given to the massive task
of moving the troops and their equipment to the region.
   So until professional comic relief gets here, the amateurs are
getting top billing, and their audience wasn't complaining.
   At one point the would-be comedian led the troops in a song,
with the following chorus:
   ``Sitting on my ass in the sand, catching a tan, tan tan.
Sitting on my ass in the sand hating Saddam.''
   That had the troops howling, and many were still laughing and
talking about the show as they walked out.
   ``Everybody wants to go home,'' said Vargas, a native of Puerto
Rico. ``But if we're going to have to stay here this will certainly
help keep morale up.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli agents had detailed information about
plans to bomb a U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 but gave
the CIA only a vague warning about the attack in which 241
Americans were killed, a new book claims.
   The allegation is one of many by Victor Ostrovsky, a Canadian
graphic artist who says he served for four years as an operative of
the fabled Israeli spy agency, the Mossad.
   A New York court, at the Israeli government's request, on
Wednesday issued a temporary order barring the publisher, St.
Martin's Press, from distributing the book. The suit said
information in the work could endanger the lives of Israeli agents.
   The 300-page book, ``By Way of Deception: The Making and
Unmaking of a Mossad Officer,'' was written in collaboration with
Canadian journalist Claire Hoy. It purports to name many Mossad
agents and supervisors as it describes in detail Ostrovsky's
three-year training and many of the operations he heard about or in
which he was involved.
   In the summer of 1983, Ostrovsky writes, a Mossad informant told
his contact in Beirut that a large Mercedes truck was being
outfitted by Shiite Moslem radicals with compartments that could
hold bombs.
   The book says the informant reported that the hidden spaces in
the truck were large, and Mossad deduced the target had to be big.
``Now the Mossad knew that, for size, there were only a few logical
targets, one of which must be the U.S. compound,'' Ostrovsky writes.
   ``The question was whether or not to warn the Americans to be on
particular alert for a truck matching the description,'' he says.
   The Mossad decided to give its CIA allies only ``vague notice
that they had reason to believe someone might be planning an
operation against them.''
   Mossad chief Nahum Admoni is quoted as having told his agents:
   ``No, we're not there to protect Americans. They're a big
country.''
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said his agency would have no
comment.
   On Oct. 23, 1983, a suicide driver rammed a Mercedes truck into
the Marine compound, killing 241 U.S. soldiers who were part of a
multinational peacekeeping force. Another truck drove into the
French compound, killing 58 troops.
   In Canada, the 40-year-old Ostrovsky told The Associated Press
that Israeli agents were hounding him and smearing his name.
   He said two of his former commanders turned up at his home in
suburban Ottawa a week ago, first trying to buy his silence and
then threatening him.
   ``They said that it's better for me that I don't write it. They
told me to stop it,'' he said. He added that he asked for police
protection but was refused.
   Ostrovsky said he decided to write the book because he was
disillusioned with the Mossad and its tactics.
   Among other stories in the book is one that describes how
Israeli agents used money and sex to lure an Iraqi agent to supply
information that helped Israel blow up Iraq's nuclear reactor in
1981.
   Ostrovsky also describes what he calls a highly secret unit that
collects information within the United States about the Arab world.
The unit is called ``Al,'' Hebrew for ``above,'' and employs 24 to
27 people, most of them within the United States, the book says.
   Ostrovsky writes that the unit's bugging of the home of Kuwait's
ambassador to the United Nations led to the 1979 resignation of
Andrew Young as U.S. ambassador to the world organization.
   He says Mossad agents overheard Young meeting at the home of the
Kuwaiti with a representative of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, in violation of a Carter administration ban on such
meetings because of the PLO's terrorist activities.
   Young initially denied the meeting, then said it was a chance
encounter. But Ostrovsky says Young was forced to quit when the
Israelis leaked details of his talk with the PLO official.

   The New York Philharmonic opened its season _
getting in ahead of Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera this
year _ with music director Zubin Mehta conducting his 1,000th
public concert with the Philharmonic.
   Only Leonard Bernstein has conducted the New York Philharmonic
as often.
   Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich was the guest artist. In his
honor, a dinner dance held after the Avery Fisher Hall concert, in
a tent in Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park, was called ``A Russian
Rhapsody.'' Russian food was served.
   The concert Wednesday night began with Mozart's ``Symphony No.
36,'' called the ``Linz,'' beautifully played. Its beginning was
serious, taken at a deliberate pace. Throughout, the texture of the
music was light and clear. One could hear one group of instruments
through another group. The long lines of the second movement's
themes were expressively shaped.
   Rostropovich was soloist in Bloch's ``Schelomo, Hebrew Rhapsody
for Cello and Orchestra.'' His cello tones were rich and deep as
the voice of King Solomon, who inspired the music. The orchestra
was by turns gloomy, impressionistic and triumphant. As the
triumphant section began, when Rostropovich wasn't playing, the
conductor in him seemed to take over and he seemed to speak to the
orchestra and make a fist to conduct with vigor.
   The cellist, who left Russia in 1974, is in his 14th season as
music director of the National Symphony in Washington D.C. He last
performed with the Philharmonic, as part of his 60th birthday
celebration, in February 1987 in Shostakovich's ``Concerto No. 1''
with the composer's son Maxim Shostakovich conducting.
   Though Rostropovich surely has played the Bloch often, he seemed
slightly uncomfortable during it. He seemed entirely comfortable
playing Tchaikovsky's ``Variations on a Rococo Theme for Cello and
Orchestra.'' This is graceful music. Visually, Mehta swung in for a
big attack but the music was delicately exquisite. Rostropovich's
cello sound was a glistening shimmer, later fast and light. At the
end he clasped his hands in victory toward the orchestra.
   It was interesting to hear him play two such different styles.
   The final piece was more Tchaikovsky, ``Francesca da Rimini
Symphonic Fantasia.'' The music tells the story of an adulterous
couple, now tossed forever on the winds in Dante's Inferno. It has
broad, sweeping themes, long melodic lines, short tunes answering
each other, mysterious touches and a storm as big as Hurricane Hugo.
   With this concert, Mehta begins his 13th and last season with
the New York Philharmonic. He remains with the Israel Philharmonic,
where he was named music director for life in 1977. He also will
guest conduct.

   Another planeload of American women and
children headed home from Kuwait as the State Department accused
Iraqi authorities of intensifying efforts to hunt down American men
in their country.
   U.S. officials said at least 286 women and children and more
than 40 non-Americans accompanying them left Kuwait Wednesday on a
U.S.-chartered flight heading for London by way of Baghdad.
   The Americans were flying to Raleigh-Durham airport in North
Carolina. Their expected arrival this afternoon would bring to more
than 900 the total number of Americans who have been evacuated from
Kuwait and Iraq.
   But State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday
that life is becoming more difficult for the American men already
in custody or being sought by Iraqi troops.
   He said the 80 or so Americans who have been rounded up by the
Iraqis are being moved continually.
   ``In Kuwait, there has been increased harassment of U.S.
citizens, and more systematic house-to-house searches for American
men are now being conducted,'' the spokesman said.
   Iraqi officials have acknowledged that some American men have
been taken to potential bombing sites to dissuade the United States
from taking military action against Iraq.
   President Bush has said the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf region is defensive, but reaffirmed in his speech to
Congress Tuesday night that he will not allow the presence of
hostages in Iraqi hands to influence his policies.
   About 920 Americans have left Iraq and Kuwait in recent days and
an additional flight is scheduled for Friday. Some of those
returning have described terror-filled weeks spent in hiding from
Iraqi soldiers after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   About 1,400 Americans remain in Kuwait while there are about 200
in Iraq, according to official estimates. All of the estimated 80
American detainees are believed to be in Iraq.
   Thirteen of the detainees received a visit this week from a U.S.
consular officer in Baghdad at the Monsour-Melia Hotel. Three women
and two children were released and are expected to leave aboard an
evacuation flight.
   Boucher said the other eight have been moved from the hotel to
an undisclosed location.
   Late last week, the State Department estimated there were nearly
90 Americans detained by the Iraqis. The new estimate of
approximately 80 partly reflects the women and children who had
been held at the Baghdad hotel but who have since been released.
   The new figures indicate that the Iraqis are having a difficult
time tracking down additional Americans despite what the State
Department describes as an intensified Iraqi effort to locate them.
   Boucher said Miles Hoffman, an American who was shot last week
while trying to evade capture, was seen Tuesday by the head of the
U.S. Embassy in Iraq, Joseph Wilson.
   Hoffman, described as a financial analyst from Columbus, Ga.,
subsequently was taken to an undisclosed location. U.S. officials
here and in Baghdad have demanded Hoffman be allowed to leave the
country, the spokesman said.
   Hoffman, 33, has a shattered bone in his left forearm, Boucher
said.

<HEAD>Regulation of Trade Schools Held Flawed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a trade school owner, Tommy Wayne Downs
went as far as accompanying a prospective student to a pawn shop to
get money for a tuition down payment, the jailed man told a Senate
panel.
   In testimony before a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee,
Downs said Wednesday that he saw unscrupulous trade schools use a
variety of tactics ``approved, and even encouraged, by the schools'
owners and local management'' to lure poor students to often
inadequate training programs.
   ``In the proprietary school business, what you sell is basically
one thing. You sell dreams, and so 99 percent of my sales were made
in the poor, black areas of Nashville,'' said Downs, at various
times a recruiter, financial aid officer and owner of trade schools
in Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
   He is now serving a prison sentence for fraudulent acts
committed in connection with the federally guaranteed student loan
program.
   The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was
scheduled to continue today its two-day hearing on trade school
practices.
   Downs said also that he made down payments for prospective
students and was reimbursed from financial aid proceeds.
   He criticized loan guarantors, noting the financially troubled
Higher Education Assistance Foundation was ``a school owners's
dream and a source of almost instant money.''
   In addition, Downs charged that the private agencies charged
with licensing and overseeing activities at trade and vocational
schools seldom make on-site inspections and are so lax in
monitoring that many institutions change owners several times
without notifying appropriate officials.
   While previous subcommittee hearings questioned trade school
recruitment practices, the latest sessions focus on flaws in
regulating the institutions.
   The subcommittee chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., released a
General Accounting Office report that concluded ``the system by
which proprietary schools gain entry and retain access to federal
guaranteed student loans is seriously flawed and needs to be
fixed.''
   Trade school students account for only 22 percent of guaranteed
student loan recipients, but more than 44 percent of the defaults.
Since 1985, student loan default costs have almost doubled to reach
the present $2 billion a year.
   ``Until comprehensive remedial actions are undertaken, we are
likely to continue to face the twin problems of hundreds of
millions of dollars in losses and thousands of students from
already disadvantaged backgrounds being set back farther in their
quest to become successful, contributing members of society,'' said
the GAO report.
   The report said there are about 100 major national accrediting
agencies recognized by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. However,
only seven accredit the majority of proprietary schools.
   To get around the review system, GAO staff counsel Kim Wherry
said, trade schools are ``marketed, bought, and sold in a system
very similar to the multiple listing service used in the real
estate business.''
   Each state may have as many as 50 licensing bodies regulating
trade and vocational schools. Each agency issues licenses based on
its own standards, without any recognized uniform minimal standards.
   To avoid accreditation problems, the report said, owners buy an
accredited school and develop a connection with an unaccredited
school. Or, owners open a branch campus of the accredited school
that automatically becomes accredited.
   The Education Department said in a statement that ``many of
these problems have been addressed and progress has been made.''

<HEAD>U.S. Again No. 1 in World Trade, But West Germany Close Behind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States retook the top position in
world trade last year, but International Monetary Fund figures
showed West Germany close behind.
   And the Oct. 3 unification of West Germany and East Germany will
create an even stronger trade rival for America that could assume
the No. 1 post.
   The fund calculated the volume of trade in tons of goods shipped
rather than their dollar value because, officials said, dollar
figures sometimes give a distorted picture of trade because of
currency fluctuations.
   On the basis of volume, U.S. exports rose 10.5 percent last
year, more than in any other major industrial country, the IMF
reported. The increase gave the United States 13.5 percent of all
world trade, except in oil which is considered separately. That was
still below the 15 percent level of the 1970s.
   West Germany was close behind with 13 percent, according to the
fund's report for 1990, made public Wednesday.
   ``By contrast the share of Japanese exports in world trade
declined from a peak of 11.5 percent in 1986 to 10 percent in
1989,'' the report said.
   The United States and other countries have been urging the
Japanese to concentrate on building internal living standards.
Since World War II, the Japanese have concentrated heavily on
exports, selling much more to the United States than they have
purchased.
   ``There was broad support for the view that strong emphasis
should be placed on the bold pursuit of structural policies,
particularly those that would help improve living standards,
improve access to Japanese markets, and reduce rigidities and
distortions in the economy and in the financial system,'' the
report said.
   The IMF's board of executive directors, which represents the 151
governments that own the fund, also had advice for the United
States. The board said Americans should:
   _Resist pressures to protect U.S. industry from imports and
continue to lead efforts for freer world trade.
   _Save more, both individually and through the government, so
that exports can grow and capital can pile up for more investment
in the future.
   _Have the Federal Reserve System continue to focus on
controlling inflation, since there may still be some pressures that
push up prices.
   _Make cutting federal spending a priority, though some
countries' representatives believed an effort should be made to
increase federal revenue by closing more tax loopholes.

<HEAD>Growing Crime Sparking Fears As Communist Takeover Nears</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guns, drugs and criminals from Communist China
are fueling a crime wave in Hong Kong and many fear that as China's
takeover of 1997 approaches, things could get worse.
   ``The society seems to be unraveling,'' said Charles Chan, a
social worker who battles Hong Kong's growing gang problem.
``Before, we always used to have a solution but now there isn't
one.''
   On Tuesday, growing rivalry among Hong Kong's organized crime
syndicates, the Triads, left six people dead when three armed men
tossed homemade gasoline bombs into a crowded mahjong game parlor,
setting it ablaze.
   Police said Triads were fighting for protection money from the
Rich View Social Club and Dining Hall.
   The growing lawlessness is running both ways over the border.
Chinese criminals who flee back home have been untouchable for lack
of an extradition agreement, and the Hong Kong mafia is expanding
in nearby Chinese boomtowns.
   Only recently has the long arm of the law been catching up.
   In the last three weeks, four gangs of men, at least two from
mainland China, snatched $2 million worth of jewelry and gold.
   Two of the robberies occurred in Hong Kong's swanky Central
District, famed for the Star Ferry Terminal and soaring glass
skyscrapers.
   In one theft, crooks robbed two jewelry stores of $500,000 in
gold and shot their way through the high class area, taking a
16-year-old girl hostage and killing a passerby.
   Armed robberies numbered 245 in first eight months of this year
compared with 260 during all of last year.
   Still, the colony remains extraordinarily safe for a metropolis
of 5.7 million people. Women walk home alone at night and streets
are well-patrolled by police.
   But Hong Kong's crime wave is cresting as its people become
increasingly skittish about 1997, when Communist China resumes
control of the territory.
   China has promised to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling economic
and social system for 50 years after the takeover. But in
interviews, law enforcement officials, social workers and educators
painted a grim picture of their hopes for the future.
   A marked increase in the use of ``soft drugs,'' such as
marijuana and an amphetamine called Mandrax, which are easily
smuggled from China, is affecting the young.
   The influence of the Triads is growing, possibly fueled by a
sense of helplessness among Hong Kong's poorer youth about the
colony's future.
   Last year for the first time ever, people age 20 or under
accounted for more than 40 percent of the arrests for all violent
crimes.
   ``Triads have entered the schools in a big way,'' said Corina
Yeung, a social worker in a rough and tumble housing project near
Hong Kong's airport. ``Violence, aggression and weapons have become
normal fare for school kids.''
   ``China white,'' a potent form of heroin, is also increasingly
being moved overland through China to the colony from Southeast
Asia's Golden Triangle where it is produced, according to David
Hodson, chief of operations of the police department's narcotics
bureau.
   The specter of 1997 troubles the police department, reputedly
one of the world's finest. High turnover and a protracted pay
dispute caused in part by China's apparent unwillingness to back
the department as the law enforcement agency of Hong Kong after
1997 is hurting the force, officers say.
   Changes in China add to the havoc.
   Beijing's decade of economic reform have produced serious social
dislocations and corruption, especially in Hong Kong's neighbor,
Guangdong province, the engine of China's modernization drive.
   Hong Kong's Triads have moved into Guangdong and joined local
criminals, pushing drugs, prostitution, gambling, smuggling and
other social vices, law enforcement officials say. China's police
appear incapable of dealing with the crime boom and in some cases
might contribute to it.
   In May, for example, two Hong Kong undercover policemen were
abducted by Chinese security officials who sneaked into Hong Kong
waters to smuggle three luxury cars to the mainland. The policemen
were released only after China's official Xinhua News Agency
accused the Hong Kong government of fabricating the incident. The
Chinese officers were apparently not punished.
   ``There's no way we can stop smuggling of guns and drugs,'' said
one senior inspector in the Customs and Excise Department as he
watched a Chinese speedboat, apparently carrying smuggled goods,
outrace his Customs launch. ``It seems like out of every four
Chinese officials, at least one is corrupt.''
   Connections between Hong Kong's Triads and Chinese gangs have
grown to the point where Triads are bringing illegal Chinese
immigrants into the territory to commit crimes. The crooks then
sneak back across the territory's porous border after breaking the
law, police say.
   Since China does not have an extradition agreement with Hong
Kong, this method is safe as long as Beijing declines to help the
colony fight crime.
   But that help may have begun.
   Chinese authorities in Canton last week arrested two men wanted
in connection with one of the four recent heists. Hong Kong's
governor, Sir David Wilson, said China is committed to stemming the
growing gun-smuggling trade.
   And China recently outlawed the use of cigarette boats, the
centerpiece of smuggling.
   ``The cooperation is just starting,'' said one senior inspector.
``Let's hope, for Hong Kong's sake, it continues.''

<TEXT>
   When Eve Hutton's father was beaten
nearly to death, a Butte County sheriff's deputy told her to hire a
private investigator.
   The county, he said sadly, was simply too poor to investigate.
   For Hutton and the 185,000 others in this colorful, rugged
Northern California county, Butte's slide toward bankruptcy has
meant fewer firefighters, fewer patrol officers, longer delays at
county offices, closed libraries and a deepening perception that
their county is finally going under.
   ``There was only one deputy sheriff to patrol 30,000 people, and
he told me there was not enough manpower to investigate this crime
as it should be investigated,'' said Hutton, whose father, a real
estate broker, remains hospitalized from an attack by eight men
while he inspected property.
   ``That's what it's come down to: They don't even have enough
people to investigate attempted murder.''
   Local authorities, unable to come up with $15 million needed to
balance their $155 million budget, say they will decide within two
weeks whether Butte will be the first county in the nation to
declare bankruptcy.
   The tax base in mostly agricultural Butte is buckling under a
big welfare caseload _ 60 percent above the per capita state
average _ and a large retirement community. In June, voters
rejected several tax increases.
   The lack of revenue has meant the elimination of 23 jobs at the
sheriff's department and the part-time operation of libraries with
volunteers. Because of a four-year freeze on county salaries, 15
workers in Butte's welfare department qualify for benefits
themselves.
   ``Nobody is really sure what this bankruptcy will do,'' said
James Souci. He said the county offered him and his neighbors
equipment to form a volunteer firefighting unit if they would agree
to maintain it. ``They said they just didn't have the money,'' he
said.
   If the county actually filed for bankruptcy, a federal judge in
Sacramento would most likely protect Butte from its creditors,
appoint a fiscal trustee and set up a priority list of who gets
paid what.
   But since a county has never filed for bankruptcy before,
``there are a whole lot of gray zones here. We really don't know
exactly what would happen,'' said spokeswoman Christina Cutshaw of
the state County Supervisors Association.
   Despite its relatively small size, Butte County has been
accustomed over the years to the glare of state and national
attention. The 1938 movie classic ``The Adventures of Robin Hood,''
was filmed in Chico, and a year later the Twelve Oaks barbecue in
``Gone With the Wind'' was filmed at a Butte estate.
   The media focus has not been so benign in the past decade.
   In one case, two white hunters were convicted of murdering a
black man after they couldn't find a deer. In another, a
self-styled Nazi was convicted of killing one of his followers. And
the Oroville City Council considered and ultimately rejected an
ordinance requiring people to keep a gun at home.
   Playboy once ranked California State University at Chico as the
nation's No. 1 party school. Earlier this year, hundreds of
beer-drinking students went on a weekend rampage there.
   Butte's fiscal problems stem from costly welfare and health care
programs, county authorities say, and the state's failure to kick
in money. ``Almost 90 percent of our budget is committed to
mandatory programs,'' said Supervisor Jane Dolan.
   Authorities also say more poor people are coming in from the
cities, swelling the welfare rolls.
   Butte ranks last among the state's 58 counties in the amount
spent per capita on local government. The maintenance budget has
been reduced to a level that provides money to resurface the
average county road once every 28 years.
   Gov. George Deukmejian suggests the county has failed to manage
its money properly. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown noted that Butte
recently voted down tax increases to finance, among other things,
firefighting improvements.
   Deukmejian has offered to cover about half the shortfall, some
$8 million, if Butte makes up the rest by such measures as cutting
workers and benefits and freezing pay. On Tuesday, Butte rejected
the cuts and asked for more money.

   Bountiful corn and wheat harvests are
restoring some muscle to the nation's granary, Agriculture
Department analysts say.
   Although that will help dampen some of the food price runup
expected next year because of the Persian Gulf crisis and higher
energy costs, the bumper yields will mean lower commodity prices
for farmers.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Wednesday
that corn production is expected to rise to a four-year high of
8.12 billion bushels, up 8 percent from last year's crop and 3
percent more than forecast a month ago.
   Last year's corn harvest was 7.53 billion bushels, and the
department in its initial forecast on Aug. 9 put this fall's
harvest at 7.85 billion bushels.
   ``Above-normal temperatures the last of August accelerated
development (of the corn crop), but it still lagged behind normal
in most of the major producing states,'' said the Agricultural
Statistics Board.
   By Sept. 2, only about 7 percent of the corn acreage was mature,
19 percentage points behind normal, although harvest had begun as
far north as Kentucky.
   Globally, the boost in U.S. corn prospects helped improve the
world outlook for coarse grains, despite some decline in foreign
production. Corn yields in France and the southern countries of
Eastern Europe have been hurt by continued hot, dry weather.
   The September estimate of 8.12 billion bushels would be the
largest corn output since 8.23 billion bushels were harvested in
1986.
   Based on early September surveys, corn yields were estimated at
a record 121.7 bushels per acre harvested, compared with 116.2 last
year and 117.7 indicated last month. The old record was 119.4
bushels in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent this year.
   The huge corn harvest, along with bumper wheat yields, will help
cushion against sharp food price increases in 1991.
   Production of soybeans, a source of high-protein meal and
vegetable oil, was estimated at 1.83 billion bushels, down 5
percent from last year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels and
virtually unchanged from the August estimate.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.7 million bales, up 21
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales but down 1
percent from the August forecast.
   The September report showed total 1990 wheat production at 2.76
billion bushels, up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest and up 2
percent from last month's projection. Average yields, at 39.4
bushels per acre, equal the record high of 1983.
   USDA's all-crops production index was reported at 112 percent of
its 1977 average used for comparison. That is the highest reading
since the index averaged 116 percent in 1985.
   Last year, although crop production rebounded sharply from the
91 percent of the 1988 drought, total output still averaged only
106 percent. The record was 117 percent in 1981 and 1982.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1990-91 marketing year that
began Sept. 1 is expected to be about 8.075 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production, that will
mean a small increase in U.S. corn stockpiles to about 1.375
billion bushels left over by Sept. 1, 1991.
   A month ago, with a smaller harvest expected, analysts expected
the corn stockpile to decline in the coming year.
   Despite the modest upturn, the stockpile is a sharp turnaround
from last season's decline, when it plummeted from 4.26 billion
bushels on Sept. 1, 1988 to 1.93 billion bushels on hand last Sept.
1.
   The report said U.S. corn prices may average in the range of
$2.10 to $2.50 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, down 25
cents from the August projection. Corn prices at the farm averaged
about $2.38 per bushel last season.
   With larger-than-expected wheat production, the stockpile at the
end of the 1990-91 marketing year next June is expected to be 946
million bushels, 100 million bushels more than forecast in August
and almost double the 535 million bushels carried over this June 1.
   As a result of the larger wheat supply, prices at the farm are
expected to decline to an average of $2.55 to $2.85 per bushel this
marketing year from $3.72 in 1989-90.
   Soybean prices at the farm were forecast at $5.50 to $7 per
bushel in 1990-91, compared with $5.70 the past marketing year.
That was unchanged from the August forecast.
   Other 1990 crop estimates based on Sept. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   _Sorghum, 572.4 million bushels and an average yield of 61.8
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   _Rice, 159 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,641 pounds per
acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   _Peanuts, 3.56 billion pounds and a yield of 2,043 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   _Tobacco, 1.55 billion pounds and a yield of 2,127 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   _Sugar beets, 27.3 million tons and a yield of 19.9 tons per
acre, compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   _Sugar cane, 24.7 million tons and a yield of 34.9 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter tried unsuccessfully to have the appeal of his
Iran-Contra convictions heard by the same judges who set aside
guilty verdicts against Oliver L. North.
   But the three-judge panel that heard North's case this week
refused to assign itself Poindexter's appeal. The case will be
heard by another panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral, was found guilty April
7 of five counts of lying to Congress about covert military
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and the sale of U.S.
arms to Iran.
   He was sentenced to six months in prison on June 11, but is free
pending appeal.
   North's three felony convictions were set aside July 20 on a 2-1
vote by the appeals court panel. The former National Security
Council aide had been fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200
hours of community service.
   The panel, over the vigorous dissent of Chief Judge Patricia
Wald, held that testimony North gave Congress under a limited grant
of immunity from prosecution may have seeped into his trial.
   It ordered a ``witness by witness'' review of the testimony in
North's trial to determine if it was influenced by what North told
Congress during televised hearings on the Iran-Contra affair.
   Poindexter also testified before Congress under the same
immunity grant, which prohibits prosecutors from using what he told
lawmakers as evidence against him.
   On Aug. 12, defense lawyers asked the appeals court to assign
Poindexter's case to the panel in the North case, which included
Circuit Judges Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle along with
Wald.
   Poindexter's appeal should be heard by the same panel, the
lawyers argued, because it ``raises the identical issue based upon
identical facts.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh opposed what he called
Poindexter's ``undisguised attempt to select the judges who decided
adversely to the government in U.S. v. North.''
   In a brief order issued Tuesday, the panel denied Poindexter's
request, saying it had been filed after the July 23 deadline for
procedural motions in the case.
   Silberman and Sentelle, who voted to set aside North's
convictions, were appointed by President Reagan. Wald, a member of
the court's liberal wing, was appointed by President Carter.
   On Sept. 6, the panel ordered North's lawyers to file a brief by
Sept. 26 explaining why it shouldn't rehear the case.
   Walsh sought rehearing of the North case. He argued that
dismissal of the conviction resulted from a ``plain misreading of
the record'' and disputed the panel's finding that inadequate
safeguards were taken to screen out references to North's
congressional testimony.

   A bill heading toward Senate floor action
would require the National Endowment for the Arts to recoup federal
funds from grant recipients convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   The measure, approved Wednesday on a 15-1 vote by the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, also would extend the
embattled NEA's life for five years, with $175 million in spending
authority in the first fiscal year, starting Oct. 1.
   Arts supporters predicted that the bill's broad support by
committee liberals and conservatives, including Sens. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would boost its chances
of approval by the full Senate.
   Amid a bitter political controversy over the NEA's past support
for works that conservative critics have denounced as obscene and
sacrilegious, the Senate panel voted to have the courts _ rather
than the federal arts agency _ decide which works are obscene.
   Under the bill, NEA grant recipients convicted on criminal
charges of violating obscenity or child pornography laws would have
to return their federal grant money to the arts endowment within 90
days. They would be barred from receiving new NEA grants for at
least three years.
   Hatch said the bill would solve the problem of ``protecting
taxpayer funds and artists' freedom of expression at the same
time.'' Kennedy hailed the committee's rejection of harsher
anti-obscenity curbs on the endowment.
   On a 14-2 vote, the committee defeated a proposal by Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., that would have imposed strict guidelines on NEA
panels that select grant applications for approval.
   Coats' amendment would have forbidden support for works that
violate the Supreme Court's obscenity standards or child
pornography laws and make religious attacks. Kennedy said it
represented unconstitutional prior restraint on artists.
   The NEA's statutory authority expires Sept. 30, along with a
congressional ban, enacted last fall at the urging of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., that prohibits the endowment from subsidizing works
that ``may be considered obscene.''
   House legislation to extend the NEA's life is bogged down in
wrangling over proposals for new anti-obscenity limitations on the
kinds of art eligible for endowment support and for shifting the
bulk of federal grant money to the control of state arts agencies.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has refused to hint when
he might bring the NEA bill to the House floor for debate.
   There is speculation that Congress might duck the politically
explosive obscenity issue by giving the NEA a simple, one-year
extension and postponing a floor fight until after the November
elections.

<HEAD>Democrats Pushing Ahead with Crime Bill Despite Bush Warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   House Democrats are shrugging off a warning
from President Bush that he won't sign an anti-crime bill if it
reaches his desk without stronger death penalty provisions and
other features to aid police.
   ``It's just unfortunate that once again we have seen a crime
bill disintegrate into partisan posturing,'' Rep. William J.
Hughes, D-N.J., said Wednesday as the measure moved toward House
floor action.
   Hughes, a chief sponsor, said criticism of the measure by Bush
and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was a sign that it was ``the
political season and there's going to be a certain amount of
posturing.''
   Bush suggested earlier that the bill could do more harm than
good. ``I simply will not accept anything that rolls back the clock
on America's ability to fight crime and punish wrongdoers,'' he
said.
   House debate could begin as early as Friday on the measure,
which differs sharply from a version already approved by the Senate.
   The House bill calls for the death penalty for 10 categories of
crimes ranging from assassination of the president to treason.
Capital punishment could be imposed for more than 30 specific
crimes under the Senate version.
   The administration says the House version does not include
enough offenses. It also says capital punishment would effectively
be ended in America by a provision that would allow appeals based
on racial statistics.
   Convicts would have no more than one year after the failure of
their direct appeals to file habeas corpus appeals claiming their
constitutional rights were violated.
   Sponsors say the time limit is designed to end delays of 12
years or more in carrying out death sentences.
   The administration favors a similar plan but says the House
version would actually open the door to more delays. Administration
officials also criticize the bill for not allowing warrantless
searches if police act ``in good faith.''
   In addition, the bill contains a smorgasbord of provisions
ranging from scholarships for police officers to a ban on
sports-based state lotteries. Missing, however, is anything that
would curb semiautomatic assault weapons.
   Gun control advocates have been hoping to attach such
restrictions when the bill reaches the floor. If they are not
allowed to at least try, the House is expected to take up the
assault gun issue as a separate measure as soon as it finishes with
the anti-crime package.
   Bush on Wednesday did not use the word veto but said legislation
similar to what the House is considering would not get his
signature.
   ``The bottom line is really this: I will not sign a crime bill
that handcuffs the police,'' Bush told a Rose Garden gathering of
prosecutors visiting Washington to lobby against the House bill.
   He said, ``for the past two weeks America has been gripped by
chilling headlines that tell of kids going back to school in
bulletproof coats. ...''
   He recalled how ``a visiting Utah man _ a kid, really, sports
lover _ (was) killed while defending his mother from a New York
subway gang said to be after pocket money so they could go
dancing.''
   ``The American people really are fed up,'' Bush said. `` ... And
I urge the Congress to heed the voices of our people, our police
and our prosecutors, and send me a crime bill that will help take
back the streets.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-seven members of Congress, many of them
locked in tough re-election battles, are proposing to make gasoline
price gouging a crime punishable with jail time and a $500,000 fine.
   Coauthored by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the proposal would
enable the president to stop oil companies from using military
emergencies to gouge consumers at the gas pump. The measure was
unveiled Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference. Those
supporting it include Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Sen. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.
   The measure would grant the attorney general authority to
investigate cases of alleged price gouging. In addition, the
federal government would have the power to seize any illegally
obtained profits from oil companies.
   The American Petroleum Institute said the proposal was a thinly
disguised effort to revive the price controls of the 1970s that led
to long lines at gas stations.
   One candidate involved in a hotly contested re-election fight,
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, promised to amend the bill and make its
provisions retroactive to the current Mideast crisis.
   ``Our oil reserves are the highest they've been in nine years,''
said Simon, who faces a tough re-election fight against Rep. Lynn
Martin, R-Ill.

   Like the schoolteacher she once was,
Audrey Stubbart, at 95, still pounces on errors and drills others
on grammar.
   She works as a newsroom proofreader, a job fast disappearing
from journalism as editors rely more and more on computers.
   ``This is such a fascinating job that I don't see how anyone
gets old enough to want to quit,'' said the former homesteader who
once taught in a one-room schoolhouse.
   For nearly 29 years, Mrs. Stubbart has been the full-time
proofreader at The Independence Examiner.
   ``We want every story to be read by two editors,'' said the
16,500-circulation paper's managing editor, Sheila Davis. ``Audrey
is the second catch. She doesn't usually edit for content, but she
does catch things.''
   When she does, she frowns slightly and gets up from her
computer-equipped desk in the office fray.
   ``We need to take the apostrophe `s' out of this headline,'' she
told a young employee recently.
   ``I'm just a cranky, fault-finding old maid,'' she then said,
sitting back down and turning the frown into a smile. ``I hate to
see a mistake get in.''
   Davis said Mrs. Stubbart isn't cranky at all, even when she
hears blue newsroom language.
   ``She's a very prim and proper lady, and newsrooms are not
always prim and proper,'' Davis said. ``She's gotten an earful
occasionally, but she's never gotten upset about it.''
   Adjusting to her environment is nothing new for Mrs. Stubbart.
In 1916 she and her husband, John, took two children to the Wyoming
frontier and drove in four stakes, claiming 320 acres previously
occupied by buffalo and coyotes.
   ``I cannot recall anything but happiness that we were going to
have a home of our own,'' she said.
   Three more children came along, Mrs. Stubbart taught in a
one-room schoolhouse and their cattle and sheep farm expanded to
2,100 acres. Her close family life and love of books helped pass
insufferably cold winters.
   The Stubbarts sold the farm in 1944 and moved to Independence to
be closer to relatives. Mrs. Stubbart, a widow for 25 years, worked
nearly two decades as a proofreader at a publishing house before
reaching mandatory retirement age.
   ``Most companies _ printing or anything else _ would say, `You
can't do a full day's work at your age,' and they would not let me
prove I could,'' she said.
   But the Examiner, seeking a temporary replacement at the
proofreader's desk, let Mrs. Stubbart sit in.
   ``They said, `We'll use her three months and then get someone
else,''' Mrs. Stubbart recalled. ``But I've been here almost 29
years and they've never even tried to hire anybody else.''
   She enjoys teaching young reporters. ``So far as I know, they
all accept it very graciously,'' she said. ``I don't try to
criticize. I just try to correct.''
   Davis said Mrs. Stubbart pushes for grammatical constructions
more formal than the conversational style modern journalists use.
   ``She will argue her point and argue very strenuously,'' Davis
said. ``Sometimes I say, `Yeah, Audrey, you're right, but I'm going
to let the reporter get away with it.'''
   In recent years she's written a weekly column in the Examiner.
``I don't feel old, and that's why I believe they let me stay,''
she said. ``It is a caring community. They are such precious
people. This is my past, present and future.''

   The El rattles and rumbles over Frankford
Avenue and dingy bars like Kenny's Saloon, The Happy Tap and the
Beefhouse Tavern.
   From their dim interiors may emerge clues to a string of eight
similar fatal stabbings over the past five years that has
detectives working overtime and residents doing their own armchair
_ or barstool _ sleuthing.
   Coincidence? Copycat? Serial killer?
   ``They say he only kills women who go to bars, but you don't
want to rely on the consistency of a psychopath,'' said Jillian
Bailey, 23, as she read the newspaper one morning this week on her
front porch on Arrott Street.
   Two doors up the street, unmarked police cars were parked on the
sidewalk outside a four-story brick apartment building where the
latest victim lived. Detectives carried plastic bags of items from
the apartment of Michelle Martin, 30, whose body was found Saturday
in her apartment.
   Like the seven other victims, the woman known by some as ``Crazy
Michelle'' was a white barfly who was stabbed numerous times and
found partially clothed. All eight slayings were in the city's
Frankford section.
   ``We've had sleepless nights,'' homicide Lt. James Ferguson said
as he came out of an alley, holding a flashlight. ``We're working
around the clock. Any leads, any clues, we're following up.''
   The night before, Police Commissioner Willie L. Williams had
announced, ``We're not looking at it as a serial killer.''
   Bailey retorted: ``What is it, a fad?''
   ``If it's not one guy, then this is the sickest neighborhood in
the country,'' she said.
   Police have a good reason not to attribute all eight deaths to a
serial killer. They arrested a local fish-store worker, Leonard
Christopher, 38, in the April slaying of 46-year-old Carol Dowd.
Christopher has been in jail since, so obviously he didn't kill
Martin.
   ``They got this guy at the fish store and everyone said he's
such a nice guy,'' said Mary Trainer, 74, who has lived in the area
for more than 40 years and in the same apartment building as Martin
for two years.
   ``So now this, and everyone is saying maybe they got the wrong
guy. Or maybe there's more than one.''
   Police released a sketch of the person last seen with Martin _ a
gray-haired, beer-bellied, bespectacled man of about 60.
   Six of the victims were between 46 and 74 years old. The others
were 29 and 30 but looked older, Williams said. The commissioner
said information was being compiled so the FBI can come up with a
psychological profile of the killer or killers.
   ``Are people scared? Yeah,'' said the barmaid at the Jolly Post
Tavern, where one victim, Theresa Sciortino, last was seen alive in
January 1989.
   ``It's like watching a TV show,'' said the barmaid, who wouldn't
give her name. ``You wonder what this guy is thinking. I don't know
_ maybe he had a thing about his mother and he looks for women like
her.''
   Dee, a ``30-something'' woman, sipped a beer in the Jolly Post
and speculated. ``The women all seem to have emotional problems,
but it's still scary,'' she said. ``Maybe he thinks he's putting
them out of their misery.''
   Philadelphia's Frankford neighborhood is a mix of white and
black, with some Asians and Hispanics; well-tended houses beside
run-down apartment buildings.
   The neighborhood becomes more residential, leafy and pleasant
west of Frankford Avenue. The avenue is loud, busy and lined with
hoagie shops and stores, many with the words discount, thrift and
bargain in their names.
   ``It's spotty. Two blocks this way, toward the avenue, I
wouldn't go after dark,'' Bailey said. ``This way, toward the
boulevard, it's fine.''
   ``If this were a more affluent neighborhood they would have
found the person by now,'' she said. ``There seems to be a thing of
`blame the victim' here. `She's a crazy barfly _ that's why she was
murdered.'''

   Here are thumbnail sketches of the eight
people chosen to spend two years together sealed inside the
Biosphere II closed-environment experiment.
   _ Abigail K. Alling, 31, a marine biologist from Maine, has
directed design of Biosphere II's ocean and marsh regions, and
selection and collection of the species to be used in them.
   Ms. Alling, who holds a master's degree from Yale University's
School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, has lived in Nepal
and England and has researched dolphins, porpoises and whales in
Canada, Sri Lanka and China. She has directed the research program
of the London-based Institute of Ecotechnics' research vessel
Haraclitus since 1986, and spent five days in the Biosphere II test
module in 1989.
   _ Linda Leigh, 38, a Wisconsin native, has a bachelor's degree
in botany and field ecology at Evergreen State College, Olympia,
Wash., and did graduate work at the University of Arizona. She has
served as the Biosphere project's director of terrestrial ecosystem
design, responsible for coordinating the planning for its land
biomes: the tropical rain forest, intensive agriculture, desert and
savannah. She also was in charge of obtaining more than 2,000
candidate plant species. She spent three weeks last fall in a
Biosphere test module.
   Ms. Leigh also has been an independent consultant on endangered
plant species for the Nature Conservancy and has conducted field
research on native plant species with agricultural crop potential
for the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. She also was a botanist for a
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ecological survey in Alaska.
   _ Taber Kyle MacCallum, 26, from New Mexico, has directed
development of the Biosphere's non-polluting analytical laboratory,
working with outside consultants and the University of Arizona's
Environmental Research Laboratory.
   MacCallum worked on a marine ecological expedition aboard the
research vessel Heraclitus.
   He received health care training and will serve as assistant to
the medical officer, and has been instructed in laboratory analysis
techniques.
   _ Jane Poynter, 28, a native of England with training in
ecological field management, has managed the Biosphere's
agriculture prototype system. She supervised installation of all
systems in the intensive agriculture section, including selecting
crop varieties, developing an integrated pest management program
without pesticides, soil tests and plant care, harvesting, seed
collection, recycling and food processing.
   She also has worked with the Institute of Biotechnics in
Australia.
   _ Sally E. Silverstone, 35, also a native of England, has
administered the architectural division of the Biosphere project's
parent company and has been responsible for the Biosphere's total
systems planning process, financial administration and cost control.
   Ms. Silverstone worked in drought relief and agricultural
systems for a desert tropical area in Bihar, India. She also
managed a London hostel for mentally handicapped adults and served
as director of development applications for a tropical ecological
research center tied to the Institute of Ecotechnics, a London
consultant with the Biosphere project. She spent five days in a
Biosphere test module in June.
   _ Mark Van Thillo, 29, a native of Belgium, has been in charge
of construction quality control for technical systems. He has had
responsibility for supervising materials, for construction quality
and for meeting specifications, as well as for developing and
implementing technical systems preventive maintenance programs.
   Van Thillo was a petroleum refinery production assistant in his
homeland before becoming ship's engineer and mechanic for the
Heraclitus.
   _ Dr. Roy Walford, 66, the oldest crew member and only
physician, is medical chief and biomedical consultant for the
Biosphere project.
   A research gerontologist and nutritionist, Walford has been a
professor of pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine since 1966.
He was a Fulbright research scholar in 1960-61 and has served on
scientific panels as the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on
Aging and the National Institute Aging Task Force on Immunology.
   Walford has written more than 300 scientific papers and several
books, including two that have stirred controversy over the effects
of optimum diet on longevity: ``Maximum Life Span'' and ``The
120-Year Diet.'' Among other things, his studies with mice have
shown a low-calorie, high-nutrition diet that keeps weight below
optimum level can double longevity and delay senility.
   _ Bernd Zabel, 41, an electrical engineer from West Germany, has
served as construction general manager for the project. As such he
has been responsible for the Biosphere II structure as well as the
research and development center complex, coordinating more than 50
construction subcontractors with the design team ecologists,
architects and engineers. He also worked previously with the
Institute of Ecotechnics.
   Before joining the Space Biospheres team in 1985, he worked at
the Desert Ecology Research Station in Santa Fe, N.M., in arid land
agronomy and horticulture.

   Abortion-rights activists acknowledge it
won't be easy overturning the Legislature's speedy passage of a
veto-proof bill requiring girls under 18 to get a parent's consent
for an abortion.
   Wednesday's action was the second major victory for
anti-abortion forces in Michigan in as many years. In 1988, voters
overwhelmingly approved a ban on state-funded abortions for the
poor.
   The final vote barely had been counted before abortion-rights
leaders were talking about trying to repeal the measure or blunt
its impact.
   The Fund for the Feminist Majority planned to announce today an
emergency campaign against it. Liberal Democratic activist Zolton
Ferency already has a legal challenge pending in state court.
   Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Michigan, said his group also may sue. ``We've got to use
all available legal challenges to protect civil rights, including
reproductive rights,'' he said.
   Simon said the measure has ``serious predictable social
consequences,'' among them more teen-age suicides and pregnancies,
more delayed abortions, more teen-age mothers on welfare and more
low birth-weight babies.
   The measure requires unmarried girls 17 and younger to have
permission from a parent or a judge to get an abortion. It will
become law around April 1, 90 days after the legislative session
ends in December.
   The Legislature approved an identical bill earlier this year,
but Democratic Gov. James Blanchard vetoed it. Right To Life of
Michigan then gathered about 330,000 signatures to put it back
before the Legislature, which took less than five hours to approve
it Wednesday. The Senate approved it 28-9 and the House 61-40.
   Because the bill began with a petition drive, Blanchard, under
the state constitution, can't veto it.
   Barbara Listing, president of Right To Life of Michigan, said
the bill would encourage sexually active teen-agers to use birth
control. Girls who do get pregnant will be able to get guidance
from their families in deciding what to do, she said.
   One of the measure's strongest Senate backers, Republican Fred
Dillingham, said, ``The parental rights in this doesn't prevent
abortion. Parental rights simply allow parents to guide their
children through a very traumatic time.''
   States that enforce parental consent or notification laws are:
Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah,
West Virginia and Wyoming.
   Parental consent bills are pending in several other states.

   Share prices in Tokyo erased early gains and fell
Thursday, while the dollar edged lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 137.65 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's
138.30-yen finish. It opened lower at 137.40 yen and ranged between
137.15 yen and 138.10 yen.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell
141.06 points, or 0.56 percent, ending the day at 25,075.08. The
market's key index rose almost 200 points in mid-afternoon before
falling back due to arbitrage sellers took profits between spot and
futures markets, traders said. On Wednesday, the index rose 611.48
points.
   The Nikkei gradually weakened due to arbitrage selling in
relation to Thursday's deadline on dealing in September futures,
said Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co.
   In currency dealings, the dollar, which opened lower in Tokyo
following an overnight decline in New York, narrowed its losses
against the yen as investors sold the yen in an attempt to take
profits, dealers said.
   There is strong dollar-buying demand around the 137-yen level,
said a Fuji Bank dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, dealers said the yen's recent strengthening has turned
into a firm long-term trend because of expectations of higher
Japanese interest rates along with another discount rate hike by
the Bank of Japan.

<HEAD>Peru Rejects U.S. Military Aid to Fight Drugs, Asks Economic Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peru's new president says Washington can keep
the millions in military aid it's offering to step up the war on
cocaine trafficking. He wants cash to get farmers to stop growing
coca and for highway construction so alternate crops can make it to
market.
   Because the aid package ``is destined only for the fight against
drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this agreement,''
President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday night.
   His statement appeared to torpedo any hope his 6-week-old
government will accept the $35.9 million in military aid Washington
is offering this year to fight the cocaine trade.
   Peru could use the money. The country is reeling from the
effects of tough austerity measures aimed at curbing 3,000 percent
annual inflation.
   The government is also battling a 10-year-old insurgency by
Maoist-inspired rebels, who have allied themselves with cocaine
traffickers in return for money and arms.
   Fujimori has warned on several occasions that he would not sign
the military aid agreement with the United States unless it
included economic aid to wean farmers away from growing coca, from
which cocaine is produced.
   He has also said Peru needs help in developing alternative crops
and in building a paved highway from regions where coca is now king
so the produce can reach coastal markets.
   The rejected U.S. aid package was to finance the construction of
a training base near the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley. It also
included $20 million to build a training camp and provide weapons
and equipment for Peruvian soldiers.
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's main supplier of coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine. More than 1,000 Shining Path
guerrillas are estimated to operate in the valley, a jungle region
250 miles northeast of Lima.
   Many Peruvian politicians had expressed fear that the aid
package could lead to direct U.S. participation in a guerrilla war
that has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an
anti-drug base in the Huallaga Valley with Peruvian police. The
Shining Path attacked the base in April and engaged U.S. pilots in
a shootout. No casualties were reported.
   On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton did sign two
agreements for $400,000 with the interior minister, Gen. Adolfo
Alvarado.
   The agreements will provide vehicles and motorcycles for the
police to help combat drug trafficking and they appear to represent
the continuation of U.S. anti-drug aid to the police.
   However, Washington has as yet been unable to get the army
involved in the drug war, and through it, assume an increased role
in the guerrilla war.
   The larger aid package would have involved the army, which is
more worried about defeating the Shining Path than with controlling
Peru's annual $1 billion cocaine trade.
   The military was interested in the aid to fight guerrillas but
did not wish to tie it to the anti-drug fight. It questioned the
wording of the proposed agreement, which directly linked any aid to
controlling the cocaine trade.
   Washington's aid package was originally presented to Fujimori's
predecessor, Alan Garcia, who insisted it be accompanied by
economic aid.
   The Bush administration had planned the aid package for the 1990
fiscal year, which concludes at the end of September. Ambassador
Quaynton said in an interview with newsmagazine Caretas this week
that if Peru ``does not sign the agreement, the aid would go to
other countries.''
   Fujimori, who was sworn in on July 28, inherited a moribund
economy and a massive government deficit generated by the
free-spending government of Garcia.
   He has called off plans to travel to the United States at the
end of September for talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, according to the state news agency Andina.
   Fujimori said his ``presence is important at this time, while
the economic stabilization program is in full flow.''
   Andina had previously quoted Quaynton as hinting that Fujimori
might also meet with President Bush.

   The chemical weapons suits the U.S.
troops brought from home are so heavy and unbearable in the
sweltering desert that the Marines have replaced them with a
lighter-weight, British-made model.
   The original suits will be put in storage until the troops
return home, a spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   A spokesman said he did not know the overall cost of buying the
new suits and state-of-the-art gas masks.
   The gear, which cannot be bought in retail stores, was developed
by British Aerospace at the request of Britain's Ministry of
Defense.
   Each suit cost about $210 and each mask about $140. About 40,000
Marines have been sent to Saudi Arabia since Iraq invaded
neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Philip Congdon, a chemical weapons consultant to British
Aerospace, said the suits are ``known to be the best in the world.''
   The American suits have foam backing, which makes them
particularly warm for the desert.
   The British-made camouflage coveralls are made of modacrylic, a
synthetic fiber that allows chemicals to be dispersed and forces
them to glide over the fabric.
   ``This is 100 percent protection against anything Uncle Saddam
may throw at us,'' Congdon said, referring to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   The gas masks are more advanced than the American variety
because they have a straw inside that can be rotated to fit the
mouth. A water bottle is attached to the outside.
   However, even the lighter and more maneuverable British-made
chemical weapons suit is brutal in the heat, Congdon said.
   The secret to using a chemical suit is acclimatization, he said.
First, the person wearing it must drink 2 pints of water an hour.
   Congdon suggests working up to a routine of wearing the suit for
three to four hours a day.
   Army spokesman Barry Napp said the army had no plans to outfit
its soldiers with the new suits.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fired Police Chief Mack Vines criticized his
ouster and said he will fight a charge of lying to a panel
investigating his dismissal of an officer.
   Vines was fired by City Manager Jan Hart less than two hours
after a grand jury indicted him Wednesday. The panel indicted him
on one misdemeanor perjury count rather than the seven felony
charges sought by the district attorney.
   ``I am surprised and saddened by the precipitous action that has
been taken by the Dallas city manager. I plan to fight the minor
legal charge returned by the grand jury,'' Vines said in a
statement.
   Vines, who was suspended with pay last month, has denied any
wrongdoing. If convicted, he could get up to a year in jail and a
$2,000 fine.
   At a news conference, Ms. Hart said, ``The issue is really one
... of public confidence and trust in the leadership of the
department.''
   Mayor Annette Strauss said she felt sorry for Vines.
   ``Our police department is a whole lot stronger, and because of
his leadership, I believe that we have better ... public safety in
our city, and our crime rate really is down,'' she said. ``And I
regret what has happened.''
   Vines was indicted over statements he made in August to a panel
investigating the firing of Officer Patrick LeMaire. Details of the
testimony were not released.
   LeMaire was fired in 1989 about two weeks after he killed an
unarmed man. He was ordered reinstated in July by an administrative
law judge who ruled his firing unjustified. He did not rejoin the
Dallas force.

<HEAD>General: Army Would Have Fought Warsaw Pact Invasion During 1980
Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact was on the verge of
invading in 1980 to crush Solidarity but reconsidered after Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski convinced its leaders that some Polish troops
would resist, a retired Czechoslovak general says.
   Gen. Stanislav Prochazka was quoted Wednesday as saying that
Jaruzelski, who was defense minister at the time and imposed
martial law a year later as Poland's Communist leader, had averted
widespread bloodshed.
   ``I know how Gen. Jaruzelski is criticized in Poland for
implementing martial law. But it is a fact that then, in 1980, he
prevented a massacre,'' Prochazka was quoted as saying in an
article in the weekly newspaper Polityka headlined ``We Were
Already in the Tanks.''
   Prochazka is a military adviser to Czechoslovakia's new
non-Communist government involved in efforts to democratize the
army. Although he did not participate in the 1980 preparations,
Prochazka said he obtained his information from reports now
accessible to him.
   Prochazka had retired after opposing the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion of Czechoslovakia that suppressed the Prague Spring reform
movement.
   In August 1980, a nationwide strike wave forced Poland's
Communist authorities to allow workers the right to form
Solidarity, the first independent labor federation in the Soviet
bloc.
   The strikes toppled then-Communist leader Edward Gierek and
aroused fears among the Kremlin leaders headed by Leonid Brezhnev.
   Prochazka said the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance
prepared its invasion plans in earnest in November 1980.
   ``Soldiers were told that Poland needs international help,
because Solidarity seriously threatens socialism,'' he said. ``The
soldiers were prepared mentally and physically for possible
fighting. They were told that they could expect military resistance
from the Polish army.''
   Troops were moved into attack positions in early December, but
the invasion plans were suddenly called off on Dec. 5 after a
meeting of Warsaw Pact leaders in Moscow, he told Polityka.
   Prochazka credited Jaruzelski with averting a ``tragic battle''
by convincing other Pact leaders that an invasion would mean a high
price in bloodshed because at least part of the army would likely
resist.
   ``The date of full military readiness was set for Dec. 6,''
Prochazka said.
   ``We were supposed to surround Polish military units in their
barracks, completely disabling them from doing anything and
allowing Polish authorities to intern Solidarity activists,'' he
said.
   Prochazka said ``everyone was convinced that the intervention
was inevitable,'' but on Dec. 5 at 8 p.m. the troops were ordered
to lower readiness.
   The next day, the troops began to withdraw from the border and
by Dec. 10 they were back in their barracks, he said.
   The power struggle between Poland's Communist authorities and
Solidarity continued through 1981, amid recurring Soviet threats.
   On Dec. 13, 1981, Jaruzelski, who had been named prime minister
and Communist Party leader, led the military crackdown that
suppressed Solidarity.
   Jaruzelski defended his action as a ``lesser evil,'' implying
that if the Polish army had not acted decisively the result would
have been a Soviet-led invasion with much bloodshed.
   Although banned, Solidarity survived underground throughout the
1980s and regained its legal status in April 1989 under a
power-sharing agreement with Communist authorities.
   Solidarity won an overwhelming victory in partially free
elections in June 1989 and went on to establish the East bloc's
first non-Communist government.
   Jaruzelski was elected president by Parliament in July 1989 but
has been under pressure to resign.

   NASA restored a high-speed radio link
with Magellan that will allow a crucial test of the spacecraft on
Saturday and released more pictures of jagged lava flows and giant
volcanic craters on Venus.
   Engineers Wednesday pointed Magellan's main antenna toward
Earth, putting the high-speed communications on line for the first
time in four weeks and using the link to send home the contents of
the spacecraft's tape recorder.
   They they began analyzing the information for clues to why they
lost radio contact with the spacecraft for 14 hours starting Aug.
16 and for 17{ hours starting Aug. 21.
   Restoring the high-speed radio link was a key step toward
letting Magellan begin its $744 million mission to make highly
detailed maps and pictures of Venus using radar to penetrate the
planet's thick clouds.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory had been using a
secondary Magellan antenna to maintain contact with Earth.
Engineers figured that because the secondary antenna sends out a
broader beam than the main antenna, they would be less likely to
lose contact with the spacecraft if there were another glitch.
   Because of the communication problems, Magellan was to start its
mapping mission late this month, about a month behind schedule.
   But if all goes well during a radar test on Saturday, NASA might
simply pronounce the mapping under way then, said experiment
representative Steve Wall. The craft is 155 million miles from Earth
   The three pictures released Wednesday were taken during an Aug.
16 radar test, just hours before contact with the craft was first
lost.
   One picture shows at least two irregularly shaped craters _
called calderas _ similar to those atop Hawaii's Mauna Loa and
Kilauea volcanoes. The largest is 5 miles long and 2.2 miles wide.
   The calderas were apparently created when lava flowed from vents
and caused the volcanoes' summits to collapse, said Steve Saunders,
the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   Another picture shows a basalt lava flow 11 miles wide and at
least 15{ miles long. It has lobed edges, is extremely rough and
probably flowed in a ``thick, pasty'' manner before it solidified,
Saunders said.
   A third new picture shows a valley, about six-tenths of a mile
wide, that formed when a block of land dropped down between two
faults as the area was being stretched apart, Saunders said.
   Similar fault-bounded valleys are found in California, East
Africa and Germany.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus last month after traveling
a looping, 948-million-mile path since its launch from the shuttle
Atlantis in May 1989.

   The Leahy bill, co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., was opposed by
senators who believed inspection responsibilities belonged with the
Food and Drug Administration and the Commerce Department.
   Sens. Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, both R-Alaska, argued
that the Agriculture Department favored the red meat industry and
could hurt the seafood business.
   ``The USDA is the home of the competitors,'' said Stevens. The
fishing industry is Alaska's largest industry and produces a large
share of the seafood consumed in the United States.
   He also argued that the chemistry involved in checking for
contamination in fish already is part of FDA's expertise and
differs from the red meat industry which is inspected visually.
   Leahy said his plan for fish doesn't use visual inspection.
   ``Instead, the Fish Safety Act is based on the highly praised
USDA National Residue Program in which USDA samples hundreds of
thousands of meat products, testing them for 200 or so harmful
chemical compounds and other substances,'' he said.
   Stevens, Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., offered a substitute bill that would have expanded FDA and
Commerce Department fish inspection, but were voted down 59-39.
   The Bush administration favors the Stevens-Kennedy-Hollings plan
and the Office of Management and Budget says it will recommend a
veto if the agriculture bill passes the House.
   In the House, three bills have been approved by three committees.
   One measure, sponsored by Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, is similar to the
Leahy-Mitchell bill.
   Another bill filed by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
has strong provisions for contaminant limits, enforcement and
employee protections. It puts the entire program under the FDA.
   A third bill, backed by Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., chairman of
the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, splits authority for
inspection between the Commerce Department and the FDA and phases
the program in over time.

<HEAD>FDA Says After Tests that Close-Tolerance Drugs Are Safe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a boost for generic drug makers, the Food
and Drug Administration is assuring consumers that virtually all
drugs with narrow margins of safety meet quality and purity
standards.
   The FDA tested all the generic and brandname versions of 24
drugs that can be harmful or ineffective _ more than 400 tests in
all _ if they do not deliver the labeled amount of active
ingredients within limits narrower than allowed for most drugs.
   One drug made by two companies showed minor deviations from the
acceptable limits but posed no health hazard, the FDA said.
   ``These results should be reassuring to consumers who use
generic drugs, since the drugs that were examined are the kind that
critics of generics are most likely to claim could cause
problems,'' Dr. Louis Sullivan, the health and human services
secretary, said in the FDA announcement.
   The testing was the final phase of the FDA's program to inspect
the generic drug industry.
   The program began last year after federal investigators found
evidence that some employees in the agency's generic drug division
had accepted bribes from drug company executives and that some
companies had cheated on safety tests required for FDA approval.
Dozens of drugs were removed from the market as a result of the
investigation, and several FDA employees and drug company
executives were convicted on criminal charges.
   The 24 ``narrow therapeutic range'' drugs are prescribed for
contraception, epilepsy, infections, high blood pressure and
asthma. Much of the concern over the safety of generic drugs
involved such medications.
   The agency tested samples from 429 batches made by 73 companies.
   All passed the tests, except five batches of aminophylline, a
form of theophylline used to treat asthma. These were generic
versions made by two companies and were found to contain too much
or too little of a stabilizing ingredient that prevents the drug
compound from deteriorating.
   The FDA tested four other companies' versions of the drug and
found they met quality and purity specifications.
   The problems that were found do not pose a health danger, but
the five lots were recalled by the two manufacturers, West-Ward
pharmaceuticals of Eatontown, N.J., and Duramed Pharmaceuticals of
Cincinnati, the FDA said.
   Duramed also recalled all other lots of aminophylline as a
precaution, the agency said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. military men and women assigned to
Operation Desert Shield can now send letters and audio tapes home
free.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank told postal workers on
Wednesday to immediately begin accepting the mail, without postage.
   ``Now our military personnel can send messages to friends and
loved ones back home without postage,'' said Frank. ``We'll take
all the letters they give us.''
   The free mail applies to letters and audio cassettes sent to the
United States, but not to other parcels, Frank said. Mail sent to
personnel in the Middle East must still carry postage.
   Frank said he acted in response to bills in Congress designed to
give the free-mail privilege to Desert Shield personnel. By taking
immediate action, Frank said, he avoided the delay of having the
bills pass both houses and go to the president.
   Service personnel can obtain the free postage by writing
``Free'' on the upper right hand corner of envelopes and placing
their name, military grade and military address on the upper left
hand corner, postal officials said.

<HEAD>Bishops Ask Essential Food for Iraqi Civilians</HEAD>

   A Roman Catholic bishops' organization says it
had asked the Bush administration to make sure the trade embargo
against Iraq does not cover essential food and medicine for
civilians.
   ``The moral justification for our intervention requires that we
maintain the distinction between the Iraqi regime and ordinary and
vulnerable Iraqi citizens,'' said a letter to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III from the chairman of the U.S. Catholic Bishops's
Committee on International policy.
   ``We urge that in the implementation of the embargo and other
sanctions against Iraq the utmost care and sensitivity be exercised
so that innocent civilians are not deprived of those essentials for
the maintenance of life, i.e., food and medicines,'' wrote the
committee chairman, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles.
   A United Nations sanctions committee could not agree on what
kind of food aid to allow into Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Most of
the delegates want to allow shipments only to foreigners and
children, while Cuba and Yemen called for a broader resolution
allowing in food to all civilians.
   Bush has said the United States favors ``humanitarian'' food and
medical shipments but has not spelled out what that should mean.

<HEAD>American Airlines Sues To Keep Chicago Schedule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is going to court in an
effort to reverse a government decision allowing United Airlines
landing priorities at the nation's busiest airport.
   A scheduling battle between two of the largest U.S. carriers
intensified Wednesday when the Federal Aviation Administration
announced earlier in the day approval of new scheduling proposed by
United at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and blamed
American for causing delays.
   FAA officials said that some evening flights into Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport will be subject to substantial delays
over the next two weeks, until the new agreement takes effect Oct.
1.
   They blamed American, saying the airline, in a new schedule,
pulled out of an operating agreement and increased arrivals at
Chicago during early evening hours.
   The approved plan allows United to move some of its flights
ahead of American flights.
   The American suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, seeks to overturn the FAA decision affecting United
flights, saying it represents unlawful agency favoritism and gives
United an unfair competitive advantage. The FAA was given until
Monday to respond to the complaint.
   FAA officials said the situation was caused when American
Airlines pulled out of an operating agreement, announcing it would
increase arrivals between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., substantially
exceeding airport capacity.
   Delays at O'Hare, a major crossroads for flights around the
country, often cause delays at other airports as well.
   But the FAA said the agreement with United would reduce arrival
peaks and associated delays at O'Hare after Oct. 1.
   Until then, ``the public can continue to expect substantial
delays at O'Hare,'' the FAA said.

   Bernd Zabel says there are some things
he'll miss while he's gone from this world for two years: ``Going
to a Saturday night movie, going to a bar, having dinner. Having a
beer.''
   But all in all, the 41-year-old electrical engineer from Munich,
West Germany, won't mind forgoing such pleasures. For he'll be in
another, special world: a giant terrarium known as Biosphere II.
   His closest neighbors will be seven fellow environmental
pioneers, or ``biospherians,'' who will live with 3,800 varieties
of plants, animals and insects inside the 2{-acre glass-and-steel
dome designed to duplicate Earth's ecosystem.
   The $30 million privately funded Biosphere is a prototype for
sustaining life in space and and a laboratory for solving
environmental problems such as pollution.
   The world-within-the-world will consist of the crew members'
habitat plus six others: an agricultural area, desert, fresh and
saltwater marshes, ocean, savannah and rain forest.
   All food will be raised inside, from 150 crops rotated
seasonally to small goats, chickens, pigs and fish. Air, water and
wastes will be recycled.
   Only electricity will link the ecological system with the
outside. Computers and telephones will provide communications with
the rest of the world. Crew members will be able to leave via
airlocks in an emergency.
   The crew members, named Wednesday, have worked together for at
least three years on the project, which begins Dec. 5.
   ``I'm working five years toward the aim of the two-year closure,
and the closer the day comes, the more excited I get,'' said Zabel,
41, the crew captain.
   The other crew members, all single, are Abigail K. Alling, 31, a
marine biologist; Dr. Roy Walford, a gerontologist and nutritionist
and professor of pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine; Linda
Leigh, 38, scientific director; Sally Silverstone, 35; Taber K.
MacCallum, 26; Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, and Mark Van Thillo, 29.
   Poynter, of Surrey, England, said the biospherians have been
practicing their farming, and several also have learned how to
butcher animals. ``Nothing will be a surprise when we go in, in
terms of growing our own food,'' she said.
   Alling acknowledged that everyone involved with the project has
given some thought to the possibility that a crew member might go
stir-crazy in the Biosphere's confines.
   ``My response is, I've spent quite a lot of time at sea,''
including a stint on a research ship off Antarctica, she said.

<HEAD>Author Of Banned Book On Israeli Spy Agency Says He Fears For His
Life</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Mossad Book, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a book about Israel's spy agency,
whose publication Israel is trying to block in the United States
and Canada, says agents have threatened his life and are waging a
smear campaign against him.
   Judges in New York and Toronto have issued temporary restraining
orders preventing publication of ``By Way of Deception: A
Devastating Insider's Portrait of the Mossad.''
   Lawyers for the Israeli government argue the book could imperil
Mossad agents by blowing their cover.
   The book was written by Victor Ostrovsky, a graphic artist who
says he is a former Mossad agent, in collaboration with Canadian
journalist Claire Hoy.
   Ostrovsky, 40, who holds both Israeli and Canadian citizenship,
said in an interview Wednesday that he has accepted that ``I will
have to be on the move more or less for the rest of my life.''
   ``Once this dies down, there will always be somebody out there
to say: `Now, let's settle this account.' ''
   Ostrovsky said two of his former commanders turned up at his
home in suburban Ottawa at night a week ago.
   ``They said that it's better for me that I don't write it. They
told me to stop it,'' he said.
   He said they first offered to buy him out, saying they would pay
his expenses, those of his collaborator, and even anticipated
profits.
   ``They said money was no object. They said it was for my own
good and the good of my family,'' said Ostrovsky, who has a wife
and two daughters.
   In New York, St. Martin's Press said Justice Michael Dontzin of
the New York State Supreme Court signed an order Wednesday in his
home after he heard oral argument by lawyers but ``without any
testimony of witnesses or formal legal papers.''
   In Toronto, Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd. was similarly blocked
by an Ontario court.
   ``This is coming from the (Israeli) Prime Minister's office,''
said Stoddart spokesman Angel Guerra. ``The injunction was passed
in Canada and the judge did not read the book. There is no copy of
the book to read.''
   The Canadian restraining order is until Monday, when a court
hearing is scheduled.
   Ostrovsky says he decided to write the book because he was
disillusioned with the Mossad and its tactics.
   He says the gag order from the courts prevents him from
discussing the contents of the book or his Mossad activities. But
he said, ``If this book is all lies, let it come out, then sue me.''
   Ostrovsky, who was born in Edmonton, Alberta and raised in
Israel by his grandparents, said the Mossad agents who visited his
home told him others also would be after him, such as the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which would suspect he had information of
interest to them.
   He said right after the departure of the agents, he packed a bag
and headed for Toronto. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the
Canadian federal police force, refuse to give him protection.
   Guerra, the spokesman for Stoddart, said the publishers thought
the Israelis ``would deny, deny, deny, say he is a liar, that the
material never took place.
   He said the court papers filed by lawyers for Israel assert the
book contains ``information that could have dire consequences to
people and to other nations. They are telling us it is true.''

   The dollar weakened further against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo today, as stock prices erased their early gains and
declined in volatile trading.
   The dollar closed at 137.65 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's
finish. It opened lower at 137.40 yen and ranged between 137.15 yen
and 138.10 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
fell 141.06 points, or 0.56 percent, ending the day at 25,075.08.
The key index rose nearly 200 points by mid-afternoon before
falling back when arbitrage sellers took profits on differences
between the spot and futures markets, traders said.
   On Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 611.48 points.
   Masashi Wakabayashi, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said
today's decline was mainly due to intermittent arbitrage selling
related to the expiration of September futures trading today.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed lower after nervous
fluctuations involving mainly the yen and European currencies, said
Masato Hayashi of the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The yen is currently stronger than other major currencies,
partly because of the general expectation of another discount rate
increase,'' he said.
   The Bank of Japan raised the nation's official lending rate to
commercial banks on Aug. 30 from 5.25 percent to 6 percent, but the
market believes the nation's economy requires even tighter policy,
Hayashi said.
   The dollar has become less attractive because of pessimism over
a slowdown in the U.S. economy, he said.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.385 percent, up from 8.260
percent Wednesday. Their price fell to 81.93 from 82.45.

<TEXT>
   The state of Florida, water
managers and sugar industry executives have agreed on a $120
million plan backed by environmentalists to clean up the Everglades
and Lake Okeechobee.
   Whether the plan, agreed to on Tuesday, will be enough to get
the U.S. government to drop a pollution lawsuit against the state
and the South Florida Water Management District remained an open
question.
   The water district's governing board was to hold a final vote on
the plan today.
   It involves buying up 70,000 acres of privately owned farmland
and converting it into marshes and reservoirs that would naturally
filter polluted farm wastewater before it reached the Everglades.
The state would throw in an additional 3,800 acres of state-owned
farmland to be converted as well.
   The state, the water district and sugar growers would each put
up $40 million.
   The industry's share would be raised over 10 years by a tax of
$10 an acre on growers in the Everglades. The tax needs the
approval of the Everglades Agricultural Area, which is dominated by
big growers.
   Water managers have been developing the cleanup plan for the
past year under the gun of a federal lawsuit accusing district and
state officials of letting agricultural drainage _ primarily from
sugar cane fields _ damage the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee
National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park. The lawsuit
is scheduled for trial next year.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Casner in Washington said
Wednesday that officials hadn't seen the plan and had no immediate
comment on whether it meets federal requirements to drop the
lawsuit.
   The plan would quadruple the Everglades cleanup area that was
previously under consideration. The idea of the expanded cleansing
marsh won widespread support after Charles Lee, Florida Audubon
Society vice president, broached it in August.
   Water flowing south from farm fields would be cleaned by running
it through the marshes, where plants would absorb excess phosphorus
blamed for upsetting the Everglades ecosystem.

<TEXT>
   Arco Alaska Inc. and its parent,
Atlantic Richfield Co., have agreed to pay Alaska about $285
million to settle their part in a lawsuit accusing oil companies of
cheating the state of $902 million in royalties.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said Wednesday the state is continuing its
case against the nine or 10 other defendants. The case is set for
trial in about a year.
   The agreement is part of what became known as the Amerada Hess
case, after the first company on an alphabetical list of
defendants. The Amerada Hess company paid Alaska $310,000 last year
to settle its part in the suit.
   Alaska officials contend the state was shorted $902 million in
royalties for oil from the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River fields
between 1977 and 1986.
   The state said the oil companies often undervalued their North
Slope crude production, thereby paying the state less than it
should have received.
   ``The reason the case was settled was that it was clear to Arco
that the state's case was in good shape,'' the governor said. ``We
do have ongoing negotiations with other companies.''
   The agreement also provides a method for calculating future oil
royalties on most of the company's current North Slope leases, Arco
said.

   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms east of
the Appalachians, over the western Gulf states and west of the
Great Lakes.
   Temperatures were expected to soar above 110 in parts of the
desert Southwest and push into the 90s from New Mexico to South
Dakota.
   Winds gusting to more than 30 mph were likely tonight in Upper
Michigan, and a cool front moving into New England from Canada will
drop temperatures into the 60s.
   On Wednesday, rain fell from the southern Plains to the East
Coast, with downpours bringing flooding to Marion County, Ind., and
streets in New Orleans.
   Temperatures hit record highs, mostly in the 90s, in Utah,
Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas.
   The high temperature for the nation Wednesday was 115 at Palm

   The dollar firmed in European trading this morning
after another sharp fall against the yen in Tokyo.
   Gold prices rose.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 137.65 yen, down 0.65 yen from
Wednesday's finish. It was the lowest closing level in Tokyo since
Aug. 3, 1989, when the dollar finished at 136.40 yen.
   Later in London, it was quoted at 138.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.5905 German marks, up from 1.5860
   _1.3280 Swiss francs, up from 1.3225
   _5.3255 French francs, up from 5.3180

   _1,186.00 Italian lire, up from 1,184.25
   _1.1650 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1623
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8600, compared
with $1.8650 late Wednesday.
   The dollar closed lower in Tokyo after nervous fluctuations
involving mainly the yen and European currencies, said Masato
Hayashi of the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The yen is currently stronger than other major currencies,

   The Bank of Japan raised the nation's official lending rate to
commercial banks on Aug. 30 from 5.25 percent to 6 percent, but the
market believes the nation's economy requires even tighter policy,
Hayashi said.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$382.15 per troy ounce at midmorning, up from $381.75 bid late
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Says China Executed 500 This Year In
Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities have executed more than 500
people this year in the most severe crackdown on crime since 1983,
Amnesty International said in a report released today.
   The London-based human rights group said some people were put to
death within two weeks of their arrest.
   Amnesty said 1,100 people are known to have been sentenced to
death in the last 12 months, but it said the actual figure of those
put to death is undoubtedly much higher.
   The organization says its records indicated that about 30 pople
involved in pro-democracy agitation have been executed since
January. In June 1989, authorities crushed a pro-democracy movement
that attracked hundreds of thousands of people to central Beijing
for demonstrations.
   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said today she
could not confirm or deny Amnesty's figures on executions.
   ``On the question of human rights there are always differing
interpretations,'' Ms. Li said. ``Some organizations like Amnesty
International have always tried to interfere in China's internal
affairs on the human rights account. Those slanders and attacks
against China are totally groundless.''
   Amnesty, which opposes the death penalty, appealed earlier this
month to Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng to suspend the executions.
   The Amnesty report says almost all those sentenced to death this
year have been tried under emergency procedures that give them
little opportunity to prepare their defense.
   ``Trials are often a mere formality, with the verdict decided
beforehand and little chance for appeal or pardon,'' the report
says.
   Amnesty says the number of executions was the greatest since
5,000 or more people were killed in 1983 during a major anti-crime
campaign.
   ``The courts have been ordered to `severely crack down' on such
crimes as drug trafficking, embezzlement, gang robberies and theft
_ the fourth such sweeping attack on crime in the last eight
years,'' the report said.
   ``Despite the increase in death sentences, the level of crime
has not dropped in the last decade,'' the report says.
   Around the first anniversary in June of the government's
crackdown the pro-democracy movement, authorities tightened
security. The official press carried numerous reports of arrests of
vagrants and petty criminals and executions of robbers, murderers
and rapists as well as an arsonist who set fire to an army jeep
during last year's protests.
   On June 3-4, 1989, army troops backed by tanks shot their way
into Beijing and crushed the student-led pro-democracy movement,
killihng hundreds of unarmed civilians.

<HEAD>Professor to Become Nigerian King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Edozien says he'll miss his
colleagues and students but the chance to be king in his native
Nigeria was an offer the 65-year-old professor couldn't refuse.
   ``It's quite a challenge,'' said Edozien, dean of the nutrition
department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   He said he looking forward to assuming his new duties as king of
Asaba, a township near the western bank of the Niger River.
   ``For me, the major concern is the people. They are looking for
economic development, for improvement in agriculture, and for new
industry,'' he said. ``They want me to bring economic development
and progress to the people.''
   Edozien, who is married, will rule one million people in Asaba,
one of 20 kingdoms in the country of 100 million.
   Edozien was the unanimous choice among the male heirs of the
royal family. Five tribal councils elect the king. The last king
was his uncle, who died in October 1988. His grandfather ruled as
king for 23 years. His coronation takes place in December.
   He was born in Asaba and came to the United States in 1967 as a
visiting professor in nutrition at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He came to Chapel Hill in 1970.
   The king of Asaba is responsible for the social, cultural,
administrative and spiritual life of the people, and carries out
those duties through committees and councils, Edozien said. The
legislative body passes laws, but the king approves them.
Similarly, the judicial system administers the law, but the final
appeal is also the king's. He can overturn any verdict or appeal.
   The new monarch plans to develop businesses on the region's
agricultural economy. And because Nigeria produces oil, the
manufacture of plastics for the domestic market is part of his
plans.
   ``There's the excitement of starting something new after one has
been teaching for 35 years,'' he said. ``I can do a lot to change
the lives of a lot of people.''

   Federal officials fined Johnson City
$6,000 for removing catalytic converters from police cruisers in a
bid to protect police dogs' sense of smell.
   The smell of the anti-pollution devices temporarily deadens the
dogs' sniffing power, police dog handlers say. Law enforcement
officials say they may need those valuable minutes when tracking a
suspect.
   A city official two years ago authorized removing catalytic
converters from cruisers transporting police dogs. The
Environmental Protection Agency found out about it in July and
fined the city $6,000.
   The EPA cited the city for removing converters from three police
cars and other emission control devices from a fourth. Federal law
allows a penalty of up to $2,500 per violation, said Rich Ackerman,
an EPA section chief.
   John Campbell, city manager, said Wednesday the city may appeal.
``That seems a little out of line,'' he said. He said the city
otherwise has had a good compliance record with the Clean Air Act.

   A British acrobatic troupe postponed its
opening performance at the Knoxville World Festival because of
delays in getting its animal costumes out of customs quarantine.
   The costumes were in boxes marked ``rabbit ears,'' ``cat paws''
and ``giraffe,'' and customs officials apparently feared the boxes
contained animals or parts of them. The ``giraffe'' actually had
nothing at all to do with an animal _ it's a circus term for a
6-foot unicycle.
   The 17-member troupe Circus Burlesque retrieved its costumes and
props late Tuesday from the Cincinnati International Airport. But
after a daylong workout Wednesday, the group decided there wasn't
enough time to go on with the scheduled 8 p.m. opening, troupe
spokeswoman Linzi Bagshaw said.
   She said the troupe expected the show will go on as planned
tonight and the group may give a makeup performance before its
festival booking ends Sept. 23.

   Want to play Saddam Hussein? A French firm
will help you look the part, right down to the bull neck, cocked
beret and bristling mustache.
   The world's largest maker of caricature masks, Cesar SA of
Saumur, is churning out scowling images of the Iraqi leader to hit
the U.S. market in time for Halloween at about 25 bucks a pop.
   ``My uncle was in New York last month to sell our products, and
he saw the mood was there,'' company president Christian Saudreau
said today in this city 160 miles southwest of Paris. ``We decided
it would be a great idea.''
   The Saddam mask looks like a diseased pear. Cesar's artisans
have exaggerated the Iraqi's leader's jowls, cut a deep cleft in
his chin and drooped his mustache in a frown of distaste.
   Highly arched eyebrows top a pair of close-set eyes, both
overshadowed by a mock-up of the beret of the Iraqi leader who
sparked the Persian Gulf crisis when he seized oil-rich Kuwait Aug.
2.
   Cesar has produced a few hundred copies of the head-covering
get-up in the past two weeks and hopes to have 2,500 on the U.S.
market by Oct. 1. The mask will not be offered elsewhere.
   ``We have to act while the market is still hot,'' said Saudreau.
``This type of mask has an appeal only as long as the subject is in
the news. Once the gulf affair is over, people won't want it.''
   The company already sells caricatures of President Bush, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and other political figures.

   Thomas Jefferson Davis Jr., an
investor who helped start many Silicon Valley electronics
companies, has died at a convalescent hospital at age 77.
   Davis died Tuesday, and a cause of death was not given.
   In 1969, Davis formed the Mayfield Fund, which provided the
original financing for more than 125 high-tech companies, including
Tandem Computers, Genentech, Businessland and Applied Biosystems.
   He also developed a procedure by which institutions could take
part in venture investment, giving rise to an explosion of
investment capital that ultimately led to new technologies and
businesses.
   Davis, a 1938 graduate of Harvard Law School, served as a
captain in the U.S. Army and was counsel for the National Labor
Relations Board. He founded the International Hospitality Center in
San Francisco.
   Davis is survived by his wife, Shirley, a sister, a brother, six
daughters and 11 grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were

   The Ford Foundation has awarded $1.6 million to
19 schools to help address racial strife on college campuses.
   Under the program announced Wednesday, the 19 schools received
grants from $25,000 to $100,000 to create courses and to blend
information about different cultures into existing courses.
   ``Ignorance about other cultures breeds insensitivity and
intolerance in young and old alike,'' said Franklin A. Thomas,
president of the New York-based foundation.
   The foundation invited 200 schools to apply and 105 responded.
The foundation appointed Edgar F. Beckham to run the program. He is
the former dean at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., which
has had some recent racial problems.
   At the University of California at Los Angeles, which received
$100,000, the money will be used for a seminar course for students
and the public on the ethnic diversity of Los Angeles.
   At Brandeis University, in Waltham, Mass., which also received
$100,000, humanities faculty members will study African and
African-American history to include in their courses.
   Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, will use
its $76,880 grant to create a curriculum on the Southwest's
multicultural heritage.
   Other schools that received grants were:
   _Bemidji State University, Bemidji, Minn.
   _Boston College.
   _Denison University, Granville, Ohio.
   _Haverford College, Haverford, Pa.

   Government troops broke the Tamil
rebels' three-month siege of a strategic northern fort in a
surprise attack today that left 100 rebels and 12 soldiers dead,
according to a military statement.
   Under cover of fire from gunboats and helicopter gunships, 360
soldiers paddled across a lagoon in rubber dinghies before dawn and
fought their way into Jaffna Fort, said Defense Secretary Gen.
Cyril Ranatunga.
   Ten soldiers were also wounded in the battle for the fort, where
more than 200 police and soldiers had been trapped, military
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   An air force plane providing air cover crashed into the lagoon
after the siege was broken, military officials said, blaming engine
problems, they said. The pilot of the single-engine Italian-made
Marchetti plane was thought to have died in the crash.
   There was no immediate word from the Tamil Tiger rebels or any
independent report from Jaffna, where communications have been
severed since summer while the Sinhalese-controlled government
battled guerrillas from the Tamil minority.
   The 17th century fort had been besieged since June 11 when the
Tamil guerrillas broke a cease-fire and renewed their separatist
war against the government.
   ``The assaulting battle group has now successfully relieved the
fort and is consolidating and clearing adjacent areas,'' the
military statement said.
   Officials said the army was destroying rebel bunkers around the
fort.
   The breaking of the siege is an important psychological victory
for the government forces, but its value is likely to be more
symbolic than practical.
   The rest of Jaffna town is Tiger territory, and so is most of
the surrounding Jaffna Peninsula. Jaffna is 185 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   Nevertheless, the massive fort _ a classic of military
architecture with a moat, drawbridge, watch towers and 20-foot
walls _ symbolizes Sinhalese power in the Tamil-dominated peninsula.
   During the siege, helicopters dropped food to the men trapped
inside. Drinking water was provided in the form of ice blocks,
which quickly melted in the tropical heat. At least twice
helicopter pilots braved rebel flak to land at the fort and pick up
seriously wounded policemen and soldiers.
   Having taken the fort, the government's next task is to take the
town of Jaffna, which has been a Tiger stronghold since the
insurrection started in 1983.
   The government opened talks last year to try to negotiate a
peaceful settlement with the Tigers, who say they need a separate
homeland to protect the Tamil minority from discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority.
   The government says more than 3,000 people have been killed in
the last three months, bringing the death toll of the 7-year-old
insurrection to at least 14,000.
   The northeast is the home of most of Sri Lanka's Tamils, who
form 18 percent of the island's population of 16 million. Sinhalese
make up 75 percent of the people.

<TEXT>
   Former Hurricane Isidore weakened to just above the
threshold for a tropical storm, and its top sustained winds of 75
mph this morning remained a threat only to shipping in the
mid-Atlantic, forecasters said.
   Isidore first became a hurricane last Thursday, then dropped
back to tropical storm status over the weekend before returning to
hurricane strength earlier this week.
   ``Isidore is kinda like an old stray dog you just can't get rid
off. It's been out there for eight or nine days now and just won't
go away,'' said Max Mayfield, a specialist at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``But I think in about three days' time, it'll take off to the
northeast and (head) into the far northern Atlantic,'' where the
system should become an extra-tropical storm, Mayfield said.
   ``But it's still going to be around for three to five more
days,'' he said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Isidore was centered near 34.8 north latitude and
50.8 west longitude, or about 1,100 miles west southwest of the
Azores. The system was drifting north and was expected to keep that
course with no pickup in forward speed likely for the next 24 hours.
   Isidore's hurricane-force winds extended 35 miles from the
center and tropical storm-force winds extended up to 175 miles.
   The tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its top winds reach
74 mph, while a tropical depression reaches tropical storm strength
when its winds reach 39 mph.

<HEAD>Church Envoy's Former Security Chief Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unidentified gunmen shot and killed today
the head of security for Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, who
disappeared in Beirut more than three years ago.
   The motive for the slaying of Amin Sleit, 36, was not
immediately clear, a police spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Sleit was also an official of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party, a main ally of Syrian forces in
Lebanon's civil war.
   He was shot in the head, neck and chest by two gunmen carrying
silencer-equipped pistols who entered his business in West Beirut
and opened fire, the police spokesman said.
   The gunmen escaped in a white Mercedes that was waiting for
them, he said.
   Sleit headed a Socialist Party security group protecting Waite,
51, who disappeared in West Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987. Waite was in
Beirut to negotiate the release of Western hostages.
   Sleit and other security officials had advised Waite against
going unescorted to a meeting with representatives of Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War Faction, which claims to hold several
American captives.
   Waite had helped negotiate the release of three Americans before
his capture. No group has claimed it is holding Waite.
   Former Irish hostage Brian Keenan, who was released last month,
said Waite has been ill but is alive.
   ``He was in the same apartment as I was being held in,'' Keenan
said in a recent radio interview. ``I know Terry Waite is alive. I
know he has been ill and the illness I do not think is serious.''
   Jumblatt visited Teheran, Iran, in late August for talks on
Waite's possible release, Socialist sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   The Communist-run Voice of the People radio station in Beirut
also reported last month that Waite will be the next hostage in
Lebanon freed.
   The radio station said its prediction was based on interviews
with Iranian and Syrian officials as well as Lebanese militia
commanders.
   The 13 Western captives, held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in
Lebanon, include Waite and three other Britons; two West Germans,
an Italian and six Americans.
   Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the
longest-held foreign captive in Lebanon.

   Get along little rat! Yippie-yie-aye! Move

   County officials plan a roundup of Stephens' kangaroo rats to
relocate the endangered species as the region's biggest water
supplier spends at least $500,000 to speed construction of
reservoirs, pipelines and other projects.
   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ``is
laying plans for a new kind of Western roundup,'' the agency
announced.
   ``No Herefords or longhorns on this drive, though,'' it said.
Instead, the district will herd the rats to western Riverside
County.
   The nocturnal, burrow-dwelling critters are more closely related
to squirrels than rats. They were placed on California's threatened
species list in 1972 and on the federal endangered species list in
1988.
   Named after 19th century biologist Frank Stephens, they are
among several species of kangaroo rats, which all hop on their hind
legs. They can grow up to 15 inches long, including an eight-inch
tail.
   The roundup could start within days, and an estimated 100 to 500
rats will be captured in harmless baited live-animal traps, then
moved to empty water district property, Robbie Soltz, the
district's environmental affairs manager, said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Report: 1 Million Soviets to Israel in Next Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Soviet Jewish emigres could
exceed 1 million over the next two years and Israeli officials are
struggling for money to handle the possible influx, a newspaper
reported today.
   About 400,000 Soviet immigrants are expected in 1991 and between
400,000 and 650,000 in 1992, the Davar daily newspaper said,
quoting testimony before a ministerial committee on immigrant
absorption.
   The figures were based on the estimated 1.2 million Soviet Jews
who have applied for exit permits, the paper said.
   Some officials believe a reported rise in anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union will contribute to the immigrant increase.
   About 88,000 Soviet Jews have come to Israel so far this year,
and the number could reach 150,000 by December, acccording to the
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which handles immigration.
   But estimates by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other
officials forecast about 1 million Soviet Jews will arrive over the
next 10 years.
   Jewish Agency spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said he expects the pace of
immigration to increase, but declined to give specific figures.
   Another Jewish Agency official, Yehuda Weinraub, said
applications for exit permits were not a measure for the rate of
immigration.
   ``It's a very long process from then on before they come here,''
Weinraub said.
   Davar noted in its reports that figures might fluctuate, citing
the amount of anti-Semitic activity in the Soviet Union and how
successfully the current immigrants adjust to life in Israel.
   Michael Kleiner, head of Parliament's Immigrant Absorption
Committee, said government officials are trying to downplay the
pace of immigration because they are overwhelmed.
   ``It's wishful thinking that the Soviets are going to arrive
slowly over the years,'' said Kleiner of Shamir's rigth-wing Likud
bloc. ``Someone who is in a panic over anti-Semitism, doesn't plan
to leave in five years, he wants to leave now.''
   The Jewish Agency says Israel needs $20 billion to absorb 1
million immigrants, while Kleiner put the figure at $30 billion.
   ``The problem is that we don't have the resources. There is no
logical way how Israel can raise $30 billion over the next two or
three years,'' he said.
   Israel has budgeted $2.3 billion over the next three years for
immigrant absorption.
   The Jewish Agency has funneled $740 million in help from abroad,
and the International Israel Bonds campaign pledged to raise $1
billion this year.
   Israel Televison reported Wednesday night that of the 100,000
Soviet Jews who arrived since last year, only 8,000 have found
jobs. The report did not say how many immigrants were in the job
market, or how many were children or elderly.
   Ben-Ari noted that many of the adult newcomers are still
enrolled in Hebrew classes and are not yet looking for work. He
said that of the 13,000 who arrived last year, more than 50 percent
found work.

   The National Association of Broadcasters at its
annual meeting announced a campaign to send radio receivers and
batteries to American troops serving in the Persian Gulf.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting Company's Group W Radio division will
lead a fund-raising campaign and the Armed Forces Radio and
Television Service will distribute the radios and batteries, the
association said.
   ``Our goal is to get as many radios to as many troops as we
possibly can, with a target of 25,000 receivers with batteries,''
said Lynn Christian, an association senior vice president. ``We
think radio can play a very important role keeping our fighting
people in touch with the world.''

   Nearly 1 million people have fled toward
Jordan since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, an Interior Ministry
official said today.
   More than 360,000 refugees are waiting to cross into Jordan, and
40,000 _ mostly Asians _ are living in Jordanian camps, said
Salameh Hammad, the ministry's general secretary and chairman of
the Jordanian refugee committee.
   Another 589,000 people, many of them Egyptians, have crossed
into Jordan on their way home since the Aug 2. invasion, Hammad
said.
   An estimated 2 million foreigners were living in Iraq and Kuwait
before Iraq's attack on its oil-rich neighbor. Many of those not
fleeing through Jordan are reported to have escaped through Iran,
Saudi Arabia or Turkey.
   Jordan has spent $30 million to care for the refugees, said
Hammad. He appealed to the world to come forth with more aid.
   He said the most squalid of the refugee camps, Shaalan I, had
been closed, with its remaining refugees transferred to
better-organized facilities or sent home. The camp, which had held
up to 50,000 refugees, will be moved closer to the border to serve
as a receiving station, said Hammad.
   Most of the refugees will be transferred to two new camps near
Azraq, 50 miles east of Amman, he said. The new sites have water
lines, tents and sanitary facilities.
   Hammad said Jordan was in dire need of food, medicine,
transportation and blankets. ``In winter, people need cover,'' he
said.
   British Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker, who toured
the camps Wednesday, said there was a pressing need for air
transport to repatriate the refugees.

   Some soldiers being sent to the Persian Gulf have
their children at home to worry about. But Air Force reservist
Lorain Kuryla, who is nicknamed ``Grambo,'' also has her five
grandchildren.
   When the United States began sending troops to the gulf after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Kuryla _ an Air Force reservist
for 19 years _ didn't hesitate to answer a call for volunteers.
   ``This is what I've been trained for, and I'm glad for the
opportunity to serve my country,'' said Kuryla, who turns 63 on
Friday.
   ``In fact I feel better about going because I have no small
children at home to care for,'' she adds. ``I feel it will relieve
pressure from young mothers and fathers about being sent.''
   ``It's kind of weird to think of my mother with an M-16,'' said
her son, Michael Kuryla, 37. ``I can honestly say that my mother
wears combat boots.''
   Leaving behind her family in west suburban Hillside, Kuryla, a
master sergeant from the 928th Tactical Airlift Group, left O'Hare
International Airport on Wednesday, bound for the Middle East.
   Kuryla works in Air Force personnel and will be one of three
officers sent to the region to handle records, her son said.
   The grandchildren were the ones to come up with the ``Grambo''
nickname.

<HEAD>Settlement Clears Way for Demolition of Remains Of Honkytonk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gilley's, the defunct honkytonk made
famous by the movie ``Urban Cowboy,'' is on its way to becoming a
pile of rubble now that a lawsuit is out of the way.
   The settlement of a lawsuit between country and western singer
Mickey Gilley and Sherwood Cryer, his former partner, will allow
Gilley to demolish the remains of the club in this Houston suburb
that became a symbol of cowboy culture.
   The club, badly damaged in an arson fire this year, had been
open since the early 1970s.
   The three-year legal battle ended Wednesday with a settlement
leaving nearly all former mutual holdings to Gilley.
   Cryer also agreed to drop a pending appeal of Gilley's $17
million civil court victory in 1988, and Gilley will drop a 1989
lawsuit accusing Cryer of trying to avoid paying the judgment by
shifting assets to friends and relatives.
   ``It's all done,'' Cryer's attorney, Jake Johnson, said today.
``All of the assets have essentially depreciated down to virtually
nothing because of the taxes and liens, depreciation, buyer cleanup
and all of that. You can divide nothing by two and you've got
one-half of nothing.
   ``It's just very tragic,'' Johnson said. ``It's like a divorce,
a long and bitter divorce.''
   David Sacks, an attorney for Gilley, said Gilley will start
taking bids on the property where the club stood, and that the
demolition will rid the suburb of an eyesore.
   Under the settlement, Gilley will immediately obtain Gilley's
Club, Rodeo Arena and several other clubs and convenience stores in
Texas and Tennessee.
   Nearly all the properties, including Gilley's Club, have
significant tax liens, Sacks said, making it difficult to value the
settlement. It was unclear whether the sale of the holdings will
meet the tax obligations plus court costs, he said.
   Cryer and Gilley must each pay half of $200,000 in fees owed
court-appointed receiver Michael Wood.

<TEXT>
   West Germany and the Soviet Union today initialed
a landmark 20-year friendship treaty designed to bind the two
nations closer together after German unity.
   It is also intended as the cornerstone for massive German help
for the battered Soviet economy.
   The actual signing of the accord is expected soon between Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   On Wednesday, the two Germanys and the four World War II victors
_ including the Soviet Union _ signed a separate historic treaty
that clears the way for a reshaping of the East-West balance of
power by removing the final obstacles to German unity.
   Just as the day before, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and his West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, took pen in hand today for another historic moment,
initialing the new treaty.
   The document intends to bury any German-Soviet suspicions of
each other now that a mighty Western-allied Germany is about to
spring up in the center of Europe. The Soviets lost 20 million
people during World War II and bitter memories of Nazi aggression
linger.
   After the war, Moscow's Cold War influence over Communist East
Germany was the source of frequent tension between Bonn and Moscow.
   With Germany set to unite on Oct. 3, Bonn and Moscow want to lay
a solid foundation for relations that have been steadily improving
over the past two years.
   In the newly initialed treaty, the two sides reaffirm pledges
not to use force against one another and restate earlier vows to
honor all European nations' borders.
   The document contrasts sharply with the non-agression pact the
Soviets signed with Nazi Germany in 1939 carving up Poland and the
Baltics. Less than a month later, Germany invaded Poland to begin
World War II.
   The treaty initialed today says the Soviets and Germans ``will
solve their differences only through peaceful means.''
   ``Should one of the two sides be attacked (by some other
nation), the other side will make available no military help ....
to the attacker ... and will introduce measures .. to settle the
conflict through the use of the United Nations and other structures
of collective security,'' the document states.
   The treaty says the two nations will ``significantly expand''
their bilateral cooperation, ``especially in the economic,
industrial and economic-technological areas.''
   Bonn and Moscow are working on three sister treaties to the one
initialed Thursday.
   One of those documents will set out the details of expanded
economic cooperation, another deals with technological assistance,
and the third with covering the costs for 370,000 Red Army troops
that will be withdrawn from East Germany over the next four years.
   No figures have been released from the first two sister
documents.
   The West Germans announced earlier this week they will be
providing the Soviets $7.6 billion to help retrain homecoming Red
Army troops leaving East Germany and build them new housing.
   West Germany today also announced an additional $1.9 billion
interest-free loan to the Soviets to help fund the troop withdrawal.
   Amid the goodwill gestures between the nations, the Soviet news
agency Tass has complained about the allegeddenial of a visa for
its new West German bureau chief.
   The West German Foreign Ministry said it could neither confirm
nor deny the report that Sergei Sosnovsky was barred from the
country.
   Tass said: ``the denial of a visa to a Soviet journalist
representing a world news agency can only leave observers
perplexed.''

   Former President Reagan was warmly
welcomed to the West German capital today, a day after a triumphant
visit to the remnants of the Berlin Wall.
   An honor guard greeted Reagan, 79, and his wife, Nancy, as they
arrived in a convoy of black limousines at President Richard von
Weizsaecker's spacious official residence overlooking the Rhine
River.
   ``Sunshine for you,'' von Weizsaecker's wife, Marianne, told
Reagan before the group disappeared inside for lunch.
   In Bonn, Reagan will also meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl as
part of a 10-day private visit to savor the European political
changes of the last year.
   This trip promised to be far more successful than the West
German visits Reagan made as president.
   His May 1985 attendance at an international economic summit in
Bonn was overshadowed by a controversy that erupted when he and
Kohl visited a German war cemetery in Bitburg, where Nazi SS
officers are buried.
   During another visit to Bonn in 1982, at the height of the
crisis over stationing U.S. nuclear missiles in Western Europe,
about 200,000 West Germans massed to tell Reagan to go home.
   In a speech in Berlin on Wednesday, Reagan said West Germany's
agreement in the early 1980s to accept nuclear-tipped cruise
missile bases was a major turning point in pressing Moscow to
accept a new European order.
   Like thousands before him, Reagan pounded on the Berlin Wall.
Three years ago, he stood at the ugly concrete barrier and
challenged Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to tear it down.
   Germans applauded and shouted ``We love you Ronnie'' and
``Bravo, Ronnie'' as the Reagans walked through the Brandenburg
Gate at the former border between East and West Berlin.
   Berlin, which has been designated the German capital after the
two Germanys are merged Oct. 3, was Reagan's first stop on the trip
that will also take him to Poland, the Soviet Union, and Italy.

   About 200 soldiers and police began
today to scour 10 square miles of dense woodlands where police say
a suspect in the slayings of five college students reportedly went
on night ``reconnaissance missions.''
   The search began about 8:30 a.m. and was expected to last two
days as investigators combed the land around the apartment of
Edward Lewis Humphrey, one of eight people police say are suspects
in the stabbing deaths last month.
   The terrain included swampy wooded areas and a creek where
prison inmates last week cleared away weeds and brush.
   ``This is just another step in the investigation,'' said
Gainesville police spokeswoman Sadie Darnell. ``We're certainly not
going to leave anything unchecked.''
   Alachua County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Spencer Mann said
authorities were conducting ``an article search'' with metal
detectors, but refused to be more specific.
   The search party includes 80 people from the Naval Training
Center in Orlando, 20 Florida National Guardsmen from Lake City,
and officers from numerous state and local police agencies. Two
helicopters and about 10 dog teams were participating, Ms. Darnell
said.
   Investigators said they hoped whatever is found would either
confirm or rule out Humphrey, an 18-year-old University of Florida
freshman, as a suspect.
   Neighbors have told investigators Humphrey enjoyed dressing up
in military clothes, strapping on a knife and slipping into the
woods around his apartment at night for imaginary reconnaissance
maneuvers.
   Humphrey remains jailed on charges of beating up his grandmother.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department approved a $941,639
emergency grant to help pay for the investigation into the
slayings. The money will come from a special Emergency Federal Law
Enforcement Assistance Fund.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement
Wednesday that the ``entire nation is appalled by these slayings.
It is imperative that the perpetrator or perpetrators of such
heinous crimes be swiftly apprehended and held accountable.''
   Earlier this week, police said the hunt for the killer had cost
state and local law enforcement agencies nearly $750,000.

   A 2-year-old boy shot while playing in his
front yard was apparently the deliberate target of gang members,
police said.
   Jonathon Fabian was listed in critical but stable condition with
a stomach wound today at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center.
   Police said gang members apparently were responsible for the
shooting and to boy did not appear to be the victim of cross fire
or a stray bullet. No motive for an intentional shooting was
determined.
   ``Just when you think you know the limits of the insanity,
something like this happens,'' said police spokesman Fred Nixon.
``I have never heard of a deliberate gang shooting where the victim
was of such a young age.''
   Jonathon was playing in a push-car Tuesday evening in his
parent's front yard with his father standing nearby, when two shots
were fired, police said.
   Witnesses told sheriff's investigators that they saw three
teen-age boys running away. One carried a gun, the witnesses said.
   ``I don't know if it was fun target practice or what,'' said
sheriff's Detective Craig Ditsch.
   The toddler's 26-year-old mother, Yvonne Fabian, said her family
moved into their Lynwood home only three weeks ago. She said she
only recently started allowing Jonathon and his baby sister to play
in the front yard.
   In contrast with the police version, teen-agers on the street
said the boy might have been the accidental victim of an escalating
war between rival gangs.
   Jonathon was one of four youths shot in Los Angeles within the
span of a few hours Tuesday night.

   A federal appeals court has ruled that the city
did not violate the Bill of Rights when it refused to allow a Park
Avenue church to tear down its community house and build a
commercial skyscraper.
   The ruling Wednesday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the landmark status bestowed on St. Bartholomew's Church's
Community House by the city Landmarks Preservation Commission.
   St. Bartholomew's senior warden, Fletcher Hodges, said the
ruling would make it difficult for the church and its ministries
``to hold together into the 21st Century.'' He said they would
appeal to the Supreme Court within 90 days.
   The church argued it needed the money from rents it would have
made at the skyscraper to repair and maintain the 73-year-old
church, described as a notable example of a Venetian adaptation of
the Byzantine style.
   Attorney Gerald D. Fischer, representing some parishioners and
civic groups opposed to the skyscraper, said he was delighted with
the ruling.
   ``The church has spent $3 million of the parish's money on an
effort to develop their property,'' he said. ``Hopefully this is
the end and they will cease on this folly.''
   The head of the landmarks commission, Laurie Beckelman, called
the ruling ``a total affirmation of our powers.''
   The judges wrote that ``it is obvious that the landmarks law has
drastically restricted the Church's ability to raise revenues to
carry out its various charitable and ministerial programs.''
   Nevertheless, they said, the Supreme Court has held that
``neutral regulations that diminish the income of a religious
organization'' do not violate the First Amendment guarantee of free
exercise of religion.
   The church also claimed that the landmark law violated the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments, because it severely restricted its
ability to use the property without just compensation.
   But the appeals court disagreed, citing a 1978 Supreme Court
ruling that prevented Penn Central from building a high-rise atop
Grand Central Terminal.
   The high court said then that the landmark designation did not
constitute an unconstitutional ``taking'' because it did not
interfere with the historical use of the property and that use
continued to be economically viable.
   ``The Church can continue its existing charitable and religious
activities in its current facilities,'' the judges wrote in denying
St. Bartholomew's appeal.
   St. Bartholomew's, organized in 1835, sought an exemption to the
1967 landmark designation of its Community House in December 1983,
asking permission to build a 59-story tower.
   The landmarks commission denied the request and a second one the
following year in which the church proposed a scaled-down, 47-story
building.
   The church filed a third application seeking a ``hardship
exception,'' which was denied in 1986 following exhaustive public
hearings.
   A review of church finances in the early 1980s indicated that
St. Bartholomew's endowment of $9 million would not maintain the
buildings and finance church programs, said Hodges.

   At least nine people were
killed today and hundreds of homes burned in another day of black
factional fighting. The African National Congress warned that South
Africa is in an ``undeclared war.''
   The ANC has accused the white-dominated government of siding
with more conservative blacks who have been battling ANC supporters
for a month in fighting that has left more than 700 dead in
townships around Johannesburg.
   Police officials said seven people were killed and about 400
houses and shacks burned in fighting early today at Tokoza township
between rival gangs of Zulus and Xhosas armed with axes, swords and
clubs.
   ``It's flattened. It's completely flattened,'' said a stunned
woman who went to one area to search for a friend.
   Thousands of blacks fled the townships with their possessions
piled in wheelbarrows and shopping carts, seeking shelter at
hospitals, schools and churches.
   Natalspruit Hospital officials said 8,000 refugees were huddled
on hospital grounds for protection.
   Police also reported one death in Vosloorus, another
Johannesburg-area township, and said a black policeman was fatally
stabbed in Soweto. Four policemen have been killed in Soweto, the
country's largest township, since Tuesday night.
   White local authorities cut electricity Thursday to Tokoza and
Vosloorus in response to a five-month boycott of bill payments by
residents, the government-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
   Ronnie Mamoepa of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front
said the cutoff would spawn ``a climate which is conducive for the
escalation of violence.''
   Blacks in the townships have refused to pay rent and electricity
charges to protest various grievances. But local governments say
they are broke and will cut services until the bills are paid.
   At least 57 people were killed Wednesday, one of the bloodiest
days since factional battles began on Aug. 12, police said.
   Assault guns and tracer bullets, which start fires, were being
used in the fighting, The Star newspaper reported today.
   Among those killed Wednesday, police said, were 25 Zulu migrant
workers hacked to death at a hostel in Tembisa. At least one man
was beheaded, police said.
   Chris Hani, head of the ANC's armed wing, said late Wednesday
that the country was in an ``undeclared war'' and the opposition
group had to defend people. He did not say what action the ANC
might take.
   ``We have a historical obligation to defend our people,'' he
said at a memorial service for victims of the violence.``Our duty
now is to mobilize the masses and reconsider our strategy.''
   Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement have been
battling Xhosas and other blacks supporting the African National
Congress. The fighting spread from the eastern province of Natal,
where the ANC-Inkatha feud has killed about 5,000 blacks since 1986.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela held talks
earlier this week on trying to stop the violence, but failed to
agree.
   The ANC has accused police of helping instigate the violence,
accusations rejected by the government.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid _ the government's
policy of racial separation _ but differ over plans for a future
South Africa. The left-leaning ANC favors some degree of government
economic control while Inkatha champions free market measures.
   The two sides are also divided over leadership issues with the
strongly Zulu nationalist Inkatha charging the ANC is
Xhosa-dominated. Many top ANC leaders are Xhosas, but the
organization spurns tribal ties.

   A forest fire in the southern Black Hills
moved into Custer State Park early today. More people fled their
homes, and the U.S. Forest Service bolstered its firefighting
efforts.
   Park Superintendent Rollie Noem said the fire jumped Highway 87,
the park's main north-south road, at about 3 a.m. A lodge and some
private homes in the area were evacuated.
   Forest Service spokeswoman Mary Sue Waxler said the size of the
fire was about 3,000 acres. About 350 people were fighting the
fire, Waxler said, with 100 more on the way.
   No injuries and no structural damage were reported. No buildings
were threatened but fire trucks were standing by to protect
property.
   On Wednesday, 14 homes were evacuated in the general path of the
fire. The fire stopped advancing about 1{ miles from the homes.
   The number of people who live in the area was not known. But
officials said 25 families went to a temporary shelter at the
Custer Armory looking for places to stay. Shelter director Mary
Hutt said all found rooms either with family or friends.
   The fire was reported about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday by a state fire
lookout. Officials said it was caused by logging equipment in a
timber sale area south of Cicero Peak. Cicero Peak is a 6,100-foot
mountain about 10 miles south of Custer and 10 miles west of the
western border of Custer State Park.

<HEAD>White House Says U.S. Official in Kuwait Acted Properly Before
Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House today declined to criticize
U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie for failing to anticipate that Saddam
Hussein would invade Kuwait, saying ``the whole world was misled.''
   In her dealings with the Iraqi leader prior to the Aug. 2
invasion, Ms. Glaspie was just reflecting then-U.S. policy of
seeking to nurture relations with Baghdad, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the fact that the U.S. ambassador to Iraq is now
desk bound at the State Department does not reflect any lack of
faith in her abilities.
   ``We believe Ambassador Glaspie is an outstanding
professional,'' Fitzwater said.
   However, he did not dispute reports that Saddam had made
menacing comments to Ms. Glaspie a week before the invasion
suggesting that the United States should not oppose Iraqi aims in
the Middle East.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that an
Iraqi-supplied transcript of the July 25 meeting suggested that Ms.
Glaspie reassured Saddam that the United States had no official
position on Iraq's border dispute with Kuwait.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Wednesday refused
to comment on the remarks in the transcript.
   ``We won't comment on the content or the authenticity'' of the
purported transcript,'' Fitzwater said today.
   Ms. Glaspie was as surprised by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as
were other U.S. officials, Fitzwater said.
   In fact, she flew to London a day before the invasion on her way
to Washington. Once here, she was told not to return to Baghdad.
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad now is headed by Joseph C. Wilson III,
a career diplomat.
   Ms. Glaspie has been working as a senior Iraqi desk officer in
Washington.
   ``The fact is that Saddam Hussein has lied to everyone in the
world,'' including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's
King Hussein, Fitzwater said. ``The whole world was misled in that
sense.''
   Fitzwater said Ms. Glaspie was part of a U.S. task force keeping
a close eye on the situation and that she ``maintains daily
contacts with her colleagues in the embassy in Baghdad.''
   The spokesman said Iraq probably wanted the ``impression out
there'' that it had been reassured by the United States in advance
of the invasion that Washington would not intervene in its conflict
with Kuwait.
   But, ``I think it's pretty ludicrous to suggest that any time
any place we would find it comfortable to have them invade Kuwait.
The basic implication is that somehow the U.S. would be willing to
look the other way or would have condoned this kind of action. That
is ludicrous and stupid.''

   An explosion and fire hit a plant in Soviet
Central Asia that produces fuel for nuclear power stations,
discharging gases into the air before the blaze was extinguished,
Tass reported today.
   No one was killed, although several people were injured by the
blast and fire, which occurred Wednesday at the Ulbinsky
metallurgical plant in the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk, the news agency
reported.
   The city in the republic of Kazakhstan is about 105 miles east
of Semipalatinsk, where the Soviet Union conducts its nuclear
weapons tests.
   The explosion occurred in the basement of a workshop involved in
the production of beryl, Tass reported. Beryl is a mineral
consisting of a silicate of beryllium and aluminum.
   The levels of radiation in the area were normal, Tass quoted
regional official I. Tutevol as saying. The news agency said a
preliminary investigation revealed that levels of beryl were twice
the permissible level.
   Tass, which reported the fire was extinguished in 90 minutes,
did not specify how many people were hurt or what kind of injuries
they suffered, nor did it say what kind of gases were released. It
said no one suffered from poisoning by the discharge, which also
was halted after an unspecified time.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's effort to send a videotaped
message to the Iraqi people hit a snag today when the Iraqi
ambassador refused to accept a copy of the message during a visit
to the State Department.
   But the envoy suggested that once a ``better procedure'' was
found for delivery of the tape, it will be shown to the Iraqi
people ``in its entirety'' during ``prime time.''
   ``We welcome the tape,'' Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat told
reporters at the State Department after a meeting with Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   al-Mashat said that after he rejected the tape, Eagleburger told
him the message would be delivered either by the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad to Iraqi authorities or sent by satellite.
   The State Department had no immediate comment on al-Mashat's
account of the conversation.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
``We are disappointed ... that he declined to take personal
possession of the tape for transmittal to Baghdad.''
   Fitzwater, in a written statement, said the State Department
would transmit the tape to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad ``within the
next day or two'' for delivery to the Iraqi government.
   The administration plans to release the message worldwide unless
Iraq shows the tape on state television within five days.
   al-Mashat said he ``gave Mr. Eagleburger assurances that we
welcome it (the tape). We are going to broadcast it in prime time.''
   The Iraqi official also raised the possibility that his
government might broadcast it via satellite ``for the whole world.''
   Fitzwater said Wednesday that Bush, in the eight-minute tape,
uses President Saddam Hussein's own words to discredit him. One
example was a November 1988 speech in which Saddam says that one
Arab country does not have the right to invade another.

<HEAD>Baker Meets Gorbachev; Talk of Another Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
Secretary of State James A. Baker III today that another superpower
summit meeting was possible before the end of the year.
   Baker, winding up a three-day Soviet visit, also took up with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze the remaining roadblocks to
arms control treaties the Bush administration wants to conclude by
the end of the year.
   Meeting briefly with reporters at a Kremlin session with Baker,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and 15 American business
leaders, Gorbachev was asked by the journalists whether there will
be another U.S.-Soviet summit in December.
   ``I think we are going to meet again, if our ministers do not
spoil that,'' Gorbachev said. ``A lot of work has to be done first
by the ministers and the ambassadors.''
   U.S. officials said Tuesday the United States may be willing to
agree to further limits on U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe and
certain airplanes in order to finish a treating restricting
non-nuclear tanks, artillery and other weapons.
   The other projected treaty would make deep cuts in long-range
nuclear weapons.
   Asked about U.S. troop levels, Gorbachev replied: ``We will have
suggestions about that.''
   ``We expect to summarize where we are and to see what issues
remain for determination,'' Baker told reporters earlier in the day
before a meeting with Shevardnadze.
   Baker later flew to Damascus, Syria, to try to reinforce U.S.
cooperation with Syria against Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   Asked by the reporters if the Soviet Union would send troops to
Saudi Arabia in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
Gorbachev replied: ``I hope that there will be no need to do that.''

   A man using a bar of soap he claimed was
a grenade surrendered Thursday after trying to hijack a domestic
airliner to Australia, airline officials said.
   The 27-year-old man brandished a handkerchief-covered object and
began screaming that he had a grenade 10 minutes after the Indian
Airlines plane took off from the southern city of Coimbatore, the
officials said.
   The object turned out to be a bar of soap, said the officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Boeing 737 was carrying 91 passengers and six crew on the
Coimbatore-Bangalore flight, a distance of 142 miles.
   The officials said the man, identified as T. Mahalingam, barged
into the cockpit and demanded that the captain, C.T. Srinivas, fly
to Perth, Australia, via Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
   The captain kept talking to the man as the plane approached
Bangalore, and he convinced him he could be taken to Colombo after
Bangalore. Soon after the plane landed, Mahalingam surrendered to
security personnel.
   Police said Mahalingam was a dropout from an engineering college
in Coimbatore.

   The declining shark population will top
the agenda when experts from around the world attend the first
international conference on the widely feared fish.
   Tim Moore, the environment minister of New South Wales state,
said shark numbers are falling worldwide because of too much
fishing. He said it's time Australians change their attitude to
``give sharks a fair go.''
   About 100 million sharks are harvested from the world's oceans
every year, with the level of fishing more than doubling over the
last five years, he said Wednesday. Most sharks are killed to
supply the Asian shark fin market.
   The conference, ``Sharks Down Under,'' will be held at Sydney's
Taronga Zoo in February with leading shark experts discussing shark
conservation and biology. The conference will include a dive into
an underwater cave at Seal Rocks on the state's north coast, a
shark resting place.

   At a time when skyrocketing land prices are
affecting even cemeteries, a temple in Tokyo is offering free grave
plots to people who convert to the Buddhist sect of Tendai.
   The Saikoji Temple said Thursday it is offering 250 plots, worth
$8,700 each, to Tokyo residents on condition they convert to
Tendai, the Japanese counterpart of the Chinese Tiantai sect.
   The grave sites are in a former parking lot inside the temple
compound.
   ``I understand the offer is aimed at helping people in need,
because of the acute shortage of graves and cemeteries in big
cities like Tokyo,'' said Terataka Kyodo, the wife of the temple's
head priest.
   Most cemeteries in Japan are on the grounds of temples or are
maintained by private companies or municipal governments. Many in
big cities are nearly full. Each plot is generally used by an
entire family.
   People who want their own graves must first pay a lump sum for
perpetual rent, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars, to
the owners of the cemeteries. In addition, regular payments for
maintenance must be made, even after death.

   Lottery players snapped up tickets at a
rate of 300 per second in hopes of hitting the second-biggest
jackpot in U.S. history, set today at $100 million.
   ``I'm getting lost with all the zeroes,'' Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul said as she changed a promotion sign from $96 million.
   By 11 a.m. today, the Florida Lottery had sold five times as
many tickets as its previous record week, Mrs. Paul said.
   For the fourth day in a row, the pace of sales persuaded the
Lottery Department to increase the estimated jackpot. But Mrs. Paul
said the total would not be increased again before Saturday night's
drawing.
   The nation's biggest jackpot is $115 million, shared by 14
ticket-holders in Pennsylvania in April 1989.
   In Florida, a Tampa father and son went to lottery headquarters
in Tallahassee and bought 10,000 tickets.
   ``I saved up for it. I figured it would be a good use,'' said
Anthony Giardino, 21, who bought 2,000 tickets. His father, who
would not speak to reporters, bought 8,000. It took nearly seven
hours to print them all.
   ``I figured I have a good chance of winning,'' Giardino said.
   In reality, the odds of winning are 1 in 14 million.
   In Orlando, office clerk Gary Clark said he didn't see any
reason to spend more than twice his weekly allotment for tickets.
   ``This $10 right here is what's going to get me the big one,''
he said. ``The more everybody spends on this the better, because
they'll all be contributing to me.''
   At 4 p.m. Wednesday, the state was selling 300 Lotto tickets
every second, Lottery Department spokesman Ed George said. By 5
p.m., 9.5 million tickets had been sold for the day, bringing the
week's total to about 26.2 million.

   Israel's 100,000th immigrant this year was
greeted with great fanfare on arrival but said Thursday he and his
family were left stranded at the airport when the hoopla was over.
   ``After the big hubbub was finished, we were the last ones at
the airport, and we didn't have a place to stay,'' said 87-year-old
Yitzhak Krasiltchik, from the Soviet city of Leningrad.
   Krasiltchik arrived in Israel on Tuesday on a flight with 140
other Soviet immigrants. Most of Israel's 100,000 immigrants this
year have been Soviet Jews.
   Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz met him at Ben Gurion
Airport, and he was whisked in a limousine to the arrivals lounge
where children serenaded him.
   But after Peretz and the journalists left, Krasiltchik found he
and the four members of his family had missed the bus to their
destination, the town of Arad in the southern Negev Desert.
   ``I kept telling the absorption officials that I wanted to go to
Arad, but they said it's too far and they told us to go to a hotel
in Tel Aviv. It cost us about 700 shekels ($350) for the hotel room
and a taxi to Arad the next morning,'' Krasiltchik said in a
telephone interview from Arad. He spoke through an interpreter.
   Asked whether he regretted his celebrity status, he said: ``Not
at all, I enjoy all the attention.'' He added he was getting
special treatment in Arad because of his newfound fame.
   Krasiltchik, who walks with a cane, said he wanted to take it
easy once he is settled.
   ``I want to live in peace and joy and go to the synagogue every
day,'' he said.

   A jail inmate awaiting his second trial
on a first-degree murder charge was the choice of 33,004
Minnesotans to serve as state treasurer.
   Leonard J. Richards, 48, finished last among the three
candidates vying for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination
in Tuesday's primary.
   ``I have no theory about why anybody would vote for him,'' said
incumbent Michael McGrath, who won the nomination with 148,617
votes.
   Richards, who ran for the U.S. House in 1974 and the U.S. Senate
in 1978, was convicted in the 1987 shooting and stabbing death of
his tax attorney. He was granted a new trial by the Minnesota
Supreme Court because he was not allowed to be his own attorney.
That enabled him to file for office since, technically, it
obliterated his only felony conviction.
   Richards, who is in the Hennepin County jail, also has been
indicted on murder charges in the 1982 death of his half-sister,
May Wilson. Her throat was slashed in a crime allegedly motivated
by a large insurance award.
   ``It's impossible for the voters to know a lot about all the
candidates,'' said Secretary of State Joan Growe. ``You have to
remember that the primary is just one step along the way. That's
one of the reasons we have all these steps, so we don't have these
kinds of things, hopefully.''

   Ethnic Albanian deputies of the
outlawed Kosovo Parliament declared secession from Serbia and
proclaimed their province the seventh Yugoslav republic, the state
news agency Tanjug said today.
   Meanwhile, Radio Belgrade said police raided an ethnic Albanian
village looking for arms and foreign currency, and two Albanians
were killed in a gunbattle. Two policemen were wounded, one
seriously, in the shootout, it said.
   The proclamation of independence and adoption of a constiution
for Kosovo was made Sept. 7 at a secret and ``illegal'' session of
the former Kosovo legislature attended by 111 delegates, Tanjug
said.
   The declaration, distributed to Yugoslav journalists in Kosovo's
provincial capital of Pristina, has no legal validity but may
provoke more Serbian anger and police repression against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, sources said.
   Authorities in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, dissolved
the Kosovo assembly July 5, three days after its ethnic Albanian
deputies voted for a document proclaiming the province's secession
from Serbia.
   In their Sept. 7 meeting, lawmakers also adopted an unspecified
constitution of the republic of Kosovo, Tanjug said.
   Serbian authorities claim that ethnic Albanians are seeking
independence from Serbia as a first step toward joining neighboring
Albania.
   Yugoslav republics are viturally independent states, which
according to the current constitution can declare their
independence from Yugoslavia.
   The Tanjug report, which could not be independently confirmed,
said the declaration extended the term of the dissolved Kosovo
parliament and the provincial government until free elections are
held in the region.
   The dismantled Kosovo legislature was dominated by ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's 1.9 million
people.
   The dissolution virtually abolished the autonomy Kosovo,
administratively a part of Serbia, had enjoyed under Yugoslavia's
1974 constitution.
   The province, considered by Serbs the ancient heartland of their
culture, has been the scene of inter-communal strife since Serbia's
Communist government introduced strict limits on the region's
self-government in March 1989.
   At least 60 Albanian protesters have died in sporadic clashes
with the Serbian-run security forces, and thousands more have been
sacked from their jobs or jailed, according to international human
rights groups.
   Radio Belgrade said the shootout this morning lasted for more
than five hours after police surrounded the village of Podujevo, 18
miles north of Pristina.
   ``Armed resistance was given during the raid on part of a number
of persons who used different weapons, both from the building being
checked, as well as from nearby groves and hamlets,'' Tanjug said
in a report.
   A large quantity of arms of different caliber and purposes,
communications and unspecified military equipment were discovered,
the reports said.
   Tanjug quoted Serbian officials as saying 25 people were
detained.

<TEXT>
   A towering Soviet soldier smashes a swastika
with a giant sword. Marx stares at passing traffic. Cars roll down
Ho Chi Minh. Lenin tugs on his lapel.
   Germany is less than three weeks away from becoming a single
bastion of Western capitalism, but much of the new nation will be
filled with totems to the old East Germany.
   While leaders argue over how to pay for unification and East
Germans worry about their jobs, many towns are wondering what to do
with all those old statues, streets, squares and schools dedicated
to the stalwarts of socialism.
   It is a problem far more complex than merely changing street
signs and carting away scowling icons of stone and bronze.
   In southern East Germany, Karl Marx City wasted little time
reclaiming its historical name, Chemnitz.
   But it is taking much longer to decide what to do with Karl
himself, a huge, glowering bust that dwarfs tourists who stare at
his gargantuan noggin in the heart of town.
   No community has taken a greater interest in this issue than
East Berlin, the showcase of the former Communist government and
the historic heart of what will be the capital of a united nation.
   An estimated 800 postwar monuments dot the cityscape, some of
them the centerpieces of squares. In Leninplatz, the Soviet
revolutionary is affixed to a jagged panel, scowling in flowing
overcoat, one hand on his lapel and the other clenched at his side.
   In Marx-Engels Platz, Engels stands erect while Marx sits at his
side, his huge lap a favorite place for tourists to nestle for
photo opportunities.
   A committee of artists and historians convened last week to
begin an monument-by-monument appraisal of what to do with the
memorials. A similiar committee has been charged with examining
street names.
   Some Germans want to remove all remnants of the regime imposed
by the Soviets after World War II. Others say they should, to some
extent, be preserved.
   ``Monuments, even if they are horrible or an attack against good
taste, are part of the postwar history here,'' said Klaus Hetzel, a
spokesman for the East Berlin government. ``You can find other
solutions for them.''
   The East Berlin committee members believe many statues will be
retained but altered, perhaps by adding plaques that put them in
historical perspective.
   Others may have new gardens or green spaces around them to
soften them.
   Still others may be carted away to a single location, becoming
part of a museum that will in a sense be a graveyard of Communist
artifacts.
   ``What we do not want to do is merely get rid of everything,''
said Richard Dahlheim, deputy chairman of the city's Cultural
Affairs Department. ``Too many historical remnants are lost to the
emotions of the moment.''
   Few monuments trigger more emotions than the giant Soviet
memorial in East Berlin's charming Treptow Park. Many people are
stunned by the militaristic scope of this tribute to Soviet
soldiers who died while conquering Germany from the east.
   To see it, a visitor follows a path lined with birch trees
leading to a pedestal of stairs. Two red granite walls shaped like
drooping flags form a gateway. Two giant Soviet soldiers kneel in
front of each wall.
   On the other side is a lawn that stretches for more than 550
yards, the burial place for 5,000 Soviet soldiers. On each side are
eight stone sacrcophagi depicting feats of heroism.
   At the end of the lawn is a mausoleum on which a 38-foot-high
soldier stands. Broad-shouldered and handsome, the soldier smashes
a swastika with a sword and clutches a child, creating an idealized
image of a Soviet avenger slaying the Nazi oppressors and saving
the innocent.
   Many Germans want it shipped back to the Soviets.
   ``Marx is okay, but get rid of that thing,'' said Werner
Tischer, 72, a native Berliner.
   West Berlin also has monuments to its World War II occupiers,
including a Soviet memorial and a street named after Karl Marx.
Hetzel said it will be up to a future united Berlin government what
should remain or be modified.
   An estimated 100 to 200 streets are being studied by the East
Berlin streets committee, ranging from streets named after Salvador
Allende, the former Marxist leader of Chile; to Konstantin
Ziolkowski, a father of Soviet flight technology.
   They already have decided to change the name of Otto Grotewohl
street, named after the first East German prime minister who was a
hard-line Stalinist.
   One broad avenue Americans are always startled to see is named
after Ho Chi Minh, the Communist leader who drove the Americans out
of Vietnam.
   There is even a Wall Street. Its namesake nearby, however, has
been reduced to rubble.

   The Bush administration unveiled a revised
program today to ease the shortfall in oil, but Energy Secretary
James Watkins said worldwide shortages could linger at near 1
million barrels a day through the winter.
   Watkins said he believed the shortfall can be ``managed''
through conservation efforts and additional domestic production.
   He left open the possibility of drawing oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve in the coming months if conservation and
increased production efforts fall short of expectations. But he
reiterated it was too soon to use the reserve, which holds nearly
600 million barrels.
   ``That's a cherished reserve that has a finite life ... and we
don't want to use it too early,'' Watkins told the Senate Energy
and Natural Resource Committee. He said he was ``comfortable'' that
the department would be ready to take oil from the reserve in short
notice if needed.
   The department outlined a revised combined program of energy
conservation and oil production measures that officials said was
aimed at cutting the oil supply shortfall in the United States by
about 1.1 million barrels a day.
   The new program, including a radio advertising campaign urging
conservation, came amid increasing criticism that the
administration's efforts to ease the country's reliance on foreign
oil have been more rhetoric than substance.
   ``The president should give more than a speech. He should give
us a program,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Wednesday in response
to Bush's call for increased energy conservation in light of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Watkins rejected such criticsm, saying the administration's
efforts to increase production and get Americans to conserve oil
are ``substantive ... We do not think they are trivial.''
   Much of the department's program announced today mirrored the
response plan announced shortly after the Mideast crisis developed,
including calls on motorists to conserve fuel by properly inflating
tires and various measures to expand production from existing
domestic oil fields.
   But Watkins said as much as 165,000 barrels of day also could be
saved by fuel switching and urged that regulatory and other
barriers be eased to promote switching. He said there are 37
natural gas pipeline proposals awaiting federal or state approval.
   The plan also included tax incentives for oil and gas
production, expanded production from Alaska and opening the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration _ all proposals
announced previously.
   Watkins said current crude oil stocks were well above levels at
the same time last year, but he said there was a 3.6 million barrel
worldwide production shortfall in September and that the shortfall
was expected to be gradually reduced to about 1 million by next
January and slightly lower in the succeeding months.
   The United Nations economic embargo imposed on Iraq slashed
available production from Iraq and occupied Kuwait by 4 million
barrels a day.
   Addressing a joint session of Congress on the Middle East crisis
Tuesday night, Bush asked lawmakers to enact measures to increase
domestic oil and gas production and said conservation is
``essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible.''
   But environmentalists and some members of Congress say the
administration has been slow in developing an energy plan and is
giving only scant emphasis to energy conservation, while
emphasizing expanded drilling, possibly in environmentally
sensitive areas.
   ``Never once did he mention renewable energy,'' Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said of Bush's speech.
   But since returning from their August recess, members of
Congress also have been short on specific proposals. The exception
has been House and Senate legislation calling for dramatic
increases in automobile fuel economy.
   Legislation sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., would
require automakers to improve the average fuel economy of new cars
to 40 miles per gallon by 2001.
   On Wednesday, Bryan and other sponsors said the measure would
cut the demand for petroleum by 2.8 million barrels a day by the
turn of the century. But the White House has opposed the measure
and a recently circulated policy memo suggested that the president
likely would veto it.

<HEAD>U.S. Company Making Limited Number of AK-47s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. company for the first time is
manufacturing assault-style AK-47 rifles that were banned from
import, but the company owner says he wants his gunmaking business
to be short-lived.
   E. Robert Jensen, president of Lathrop's Shooters Supply Inc. of
Tucson, Ariz., said he's making the weapons only to ``recoup the
losses from what the government did to me'' when it banned imports
just as his shipments of already paid-for rifles came into port.
   ``I chose to see if I couldn't find a way to get out of the
program in 60 to 90 days,'' he said ``I want out of that market.''
   Jensen had gotten permits from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms to import the guns before he bought them, but Customs
wouldn't let him take the weapons. Instead, he had to break them
down and leave behind the receiver, which is the trigger and firing
mechanism.
   Jensen hired a company to produce new receivers and assemble the
rifles. He says his version of the AK-47 is better than the
imports: ``It was made to higher specifications than anything the
Chinese ever made.''
   Last summer's ban on imports didn't cover domestic production of
assault-style weapons that had been barred from import, said Jack
Killorin, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   But Killorin called Jensen's action an example of why Congress
should pass President Bush's proposal to ban such manufactures. The
legislation is pending before Congress.
   The bureau permanently barred imports of 43 models of
foreign-manufactured assault-style rifles in July 1989, saying the
weapons didn't meet the ``sporting uses'' requirement for imported
firearms.
   The weapons were equipped with military-type accoutrements such
as folding or collapsible stocks, pistol grips, threaded barrels
for silencers, flash suppressors, bayonet lugs and large capacity
ammunition magazines.
   The ban was prompted by the public outcry after the Jan. 17,
1989, slayings of five children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard
by a drifter wielding an AK-47.
   ``This most recent action ... illustrates the industry's
creativity when there's a loophole to be exploited and a dollar to
be made,'' said Josh Sugarmann, director of the Firearms Policy
Project who first noticed the AK-47s were being made by Jensen's
company.
   Killorin and Jensen said they knew of no other U.S. company that
was manufacturing assault-style firearms banned from import.
   ``I don't think anyone else is crazy enough to get involved in
this,'' said Jensen, who said he has been in the firearms
distribution and retail business since 1955.
   ``There's no money in the firearms manufacturing market,'' he
said. ``If I can come out even it's going to be a victory.''
   Jensen has sued the government in federal court over the import
ban, although the government has won similar legal battles.
   ``We don't have any problem with the fact that BATF arbitrarily
and capriciously decided they weren't going to issue any more
permits,'' Jensen said. ``But I had issued permits on the basis of
which I purchased the firearms. They were legal, saleable private
property.''
   He would not specify how many guns were involved, narrowing it
only to the ``mid-four figures.'' Nor would he say how many AK-47s
he's manufacturing with the salvaged parts.
   The original price of the new guns to dealers was $498 each for
nine or fewer, $449 each for 10 or more. But Jensen said he dropped
both prices about $50 to move the guns more quickly.
   ``That's still a premium price,'' he said.

<HEAD>Florida Court: Dying Can Refuse Forced Feeding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's Supreme Court ruled today
that dying people have a right to refuse forced feeding, and that
guardians can make the decision for people who are incompetent to
act on their own.
   Further, the justices ruled, dying people and their guardians
don't need a court's approval before they stop forced feeding.
   The foundation of the decision, which comes in the case of an
elderly woman who died last summer, is the right to privacy as
guaranteed by the Florida Constitution.
   ``The right of privacy would be an empty right were it not to
extend to competent and incompetent persons alike,'' Justice
Rosemary Barkett wrote in today's majority opinion.
   Estelle Browning spent the last 2{ years of her life hooked up
to a feeding tube despite a ``living will'' she had left saying
that she didn't want to be kept alive under such conditions. She
was not comatose, but was not able to either swallow or communicate
and was considered incompetent.
   Florida's high court heard oral arguments in the case in January.
   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court said a Missouri couple could not
order the removal of food and water keeping their 32-year-old
comatose daughter alive. The daughter, Nancy Cruzan, had not left a
living will, although her parents said they were certain she would
prefer to die rather than live in a coma.
   The U.S. Supreme Court did say that competent people have a
right to refuse medical treatment.
   The Florida court, which cited that case, went on to say that it
has found previously that incompetent people have the same right,
through guardians acting on statements made before becoming
incompetent, to refuse medical treatment as competent people.
   The Browning case extended that ruling to people in Florida who
are not totally comatose but who cannot make their own decisions.
   ``The decision to terminate artificial life-sustaining measures
is being made over and over in nursing homes, hospitals, and
private homes in this nation,'' Barkett wrote.
   ``It is being made painfully by loving family members, concerned
guardians, or surrogates, in conjunction with the advice of ethical
and caring physicians or other health care providers. It is being
made when the only alternative to a natural death is to
artificially maintain a bare existence.''
   The opinion was fully endorsed by five of the seven justices,
one of whom wrote an additional, one-paragraph opinion. Justice Ben
Overton partially agreed with the rest of the court.

<HEAD>Retirees Help Fill Gaps on Ships During Middle East Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merchant seamen who have guided vessels around
the world are coming out of retirement to man the helms and engine
rooms of military supply ships bound for the Middle East.
   ``I want to go out as a champ. I'm a damn good sailor. I can cut
the mustard,'' said Donald Covert, a reactivated retiree who
admitted only to being ``over 65.''
   ``Oh, yeah, they can cut the mustard,'' agreed Wade ``K.O.''
Hughes, a National Maritime Union agent in Houston. ``They're
able-bodied men. They're tough seamen.''
   Jessica Smith, a spokeswoman for the Camp Springs, Md.-based
Seafarers International Union, said union officials last month
issued a manpower alert to physically fit retirees and other
inactive members.
   ``We've taken a number of steps to meet the increased crewing
requirements because of the conflict in the Middle East,'' she said.
   ``In addition to asking the guys on the commercial fleet to stay
on there, we've also asked our inactive members and pensioners to
get ready to ship out.''
   The Seafarers, one of several maritime unions for unlicensed
crew members on oceangoing vessels and inland waterways, told
members their country needed their skills.
   In the August issue of the Seafarers' Log, the union reported
``privately operated ships under contract to the Military Sealift
Command and vessels in the Ready Reserve Force were deployed to
take part in Operation Desert Shield.''
   As demand for supply ships and other support vessels continued,
Seafarers President Michael Sacco ordered the manpower alert.
   And the response has been overwhelming.
   Clarence Holloway, a 35-year sea veteran, served on cargo ships
in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. ``Why should I stay here?'' the
Houston man asked. ``It's just as dangerous here. You can get shot
here.''
   ``My country needs me,'' said Charles A. Mills, 69, with 52
years' sea experience. ``There aren't enough trained seamen to man
all the ships hauling military cargo into the Persian Gulf.''
   The unions have given retirees dispensations to continue
receiving pension checks in addition to their salaries for
shipboard work for up to six months.
   ``We have had several from our pensioners and older members
volunteer to help us with this crisis,'' Hughes said. ``These are
guys with key ratings, specialist-type ratings that just aren't
available anywhere else.''
   Hughes said because many of the retirees have served on vessels
since World War II, they are more familiar with the reactivated
Navy vessels and older ships.
   ``They're taking jobs that we cannot fill with our current
personnel because our current personnel either don't have those
specialty ratings or are already at sea,'' Hughes said.
   ``There are more jobs now,'' he said. ``They've taken a lot of
ships out of mothballs now and there are more jobs on older
vessels.''
   Ms. Smith said the union has sent out the call to deckhands,
storage workers and engine room workers. In the past month, she
said the union suspended onboard working limits for certain seamen
classifications, combed lists of retirees and kept union halls open
on nights and weekends to register more workers.
   Of about 100 union retirees who volunteered to be reactivated,
seven have been shipped out by last week, she said.
   Hughes said Maritime union's local chapter has had ``at least 75
retired guys call or come in wanting to help.'' Of those, he said
about 30 already have been sent to sea.
   ``They're seamen who maintain the ships, maintain the engine
rooms, keep up the appearance of the ship and serve food,'' Hughes
said. ``Their age ranges from 55 to whatever age, as long as they
are physically fit, they can do it.
   ``They've always been there when they were needed,'' Hughes said.

   The House today postponed action on the $283
billion defense bill as lawmakers awaited a possible agreement by
White House and congressional negotiators on a plan to trim $50
billion from the federal deficit.
   With the likelihood that a final figure for military spending
could emerge from the talks, the House put aside work on the
defense budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, until next
week.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters the
postponement was designed ``to give our negotiators a little
opportunity.''
   Meanwhile, the House is sending a pointed message to U.S. allies
slow to provide military and financial help for the Persian Gulf
deployment: The United States will no longer foot the entire bill
for defending the world.
   Angered by Japan's delay in giving $1 billion to a campaign that
could cost up to $15 billion in the next year, the House on
Wednesday adopted a measure requiring the Asian nation to pay all
the costs of stationing U.S. forces on its soil, or begin losing
the troops.
   The White House, which already has threatened a veto of the bill
because it would cut troop levels and terminate the B-2 Stealth
bomber, criticized the provision on Japan. ``We don't believe
that's an apppropriate way to conduct foreign policy,'' said press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   But he noted that the vote ``does express the sentiment of the
Congress. I think Japan is aware of the general feeling in the
Congress toward some of their activities.''
   The amendment was one of three burden-sharing proposals added to
the $283 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct.
1, by lawmakers who spent several hours of debate lashing out at
America's friends.
   The House had planned to resume action on the bill today with
the following issues on the agenda:
   _Amendments to increase or decrease the level of spending on the
Strategic Defense Initiative in fiscal 1991. President Bush had
called for a budget of $4.7 billion for the program commonly known
as Star Wars. The Senate trimmed about $1 billion from the 1991
request; the House slashed nearly $2 billion.
   In debate on Tuesday, the ranking Republican on the House Armed
Services panel, Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, raised the
possibility of a Bush veto if lawmakers ``decimate the program.''
   But Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sponsor of an amendment to end
Star Wars, said it was time to stop spending ``billions of dollars
on a fairy tale.''
   _Debate over the B-2 stealth bomber, the costliest weapon in
history at some $860 million a plane. Proponents of the
radar-evading aircraft plan to discuss the bomber's merits but no
vote on the issue is planned.
   If approved, the House bill calls for halting production of the
plane at the 15 bombers under construction.
   _Amendments to assist communities, businesses and workers left
without a job due to cutbacks in defense spending that force the
closing or scaling back of military contractors.
   Prompted by the rising cost of Operation Desert Shield and
little in the way of assistance from Japan, West Germany and other
U.S. allies, lawmakers vented their frustrations on Tuesday in
overwhelming votes on burden-sharing.
   By a vote of 370-53, the House adopted the amendment requiring
Japan to pay all the costs associated with the 50,000 U.S. troops
stationed there. For each year Japan does not cover the costs,
5,000 troops would be taken out of the country.
   The United States spends $4.5 billion annually for U.S. forces
in Japan; Japan contributes $2.9 billion.
   ``This is a real wake-up call for the new world order,'' said
Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., sponsor of the amendment targeting
Japan.
   Neither the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep.
Les Aspin, D-Wis., nor Dickinson voted for the measure, but Aspin
summed up the motivations of his colleagues.
   ``It is not the right thing to do substantively but it's
irresistible politically,'' he said.
   The House also agreed to require the Defense Department to come
up with a plan by 1994 to ``dual base'' all military units _
permanently stationing all American troops in the United States and
ordering short-term rotation overseas.
   It also agreed to prohibit use of any Defense Department money
for building a new air base at Crotone, Italy, for the 401st
Tactical Air Wing of F-16 jet fighters forced to move from
Torrejon, Spain.
   An amendment to eliminate the two provisions failed, 249-174.
   The House, however, rejected an amendment that would impose a
permanent ceiling of 30,000 on the number of U.S. troops in South
Korea with that goal to be achieved by fiscal 1993.

<TEXT>
   West Germany and the Soviet Union initialed a
landmark treaty Thursday intended to eliminate long-standing
distrust between the Soviets and Germans as the powerful new German
nation emerges.
   The document is also intended as the cornerstone for German help
for the battered Soviet economy. Already, West Germany has pledged
to give the Soviets $7.6 billion to help cover the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from East Germany. Another $1.9 billion will be
contributed in the form of a low-interest loan from Bonn.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and his West
German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, initialed the
friendship treaty. A day earlier, both were among the six
signatories of the historic agreement clearing the way for German
unification.
   The actual signing of the friendship accord is expected sometime
soon between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The Soviets suffered massive losses during World War II. After
the war, Moscow's Cold War influence over Communist East Germany
was the source of frequent tensions between Bonn and Moscow.
   The treaty states that it is of primary importance to ``finally
be done with the past, and to use understanding and reconciliation
to achieve an important contribution toward the overcoming of
Europe's division through understanding and reconciliation.''
   With Germany set to reunite Oct. 3, Bonn and Moscow want to lay
a solid foundation for relations that have been steadily improving
over the past two years.
   ``Now we can with justification say that the postwar period is
over,'' Genscher elatedly said after the ceremony.
   As the two nations were planning closer relations, the Soviet
news agency Tass reported that Bonn had denied a visa for Tass' new
bureau chief in West Germany. The West German Foreign Ministry said
it could neither confirm nor deny the report that Sergei Sosnovsky
was being barred from the country.
   Tass said that as relations between the countries improve, ``the
denial of a visa to a Soviet journalist representing a world news
agency can only leave observers perplexed.
   ``The journalist has been denied a possibility of providing
objective information, which is expected by Tass subscribers in the
Soviet Union and abroad,'' the state-run news agency said.
   The friendship treaty is the most comprehensive bilateral accord
between the Soviets and West Germany since a 1970 treaty in which
they renounced the use of force against each other.
   In the new document, the two sides reaffirmed pledges not to use
force against one another, and to ``honor without reservation the
territorial integrity of all European states in their current
borders.''
   ``Should one of the two sides be attacked (by some other
nation), the other side will make available no military help ....
to the attacker ... and will introduce measures .. to settle the
conflict through the use of the United Nations and other structures
of collective security,'' the document states.
   Foreign ministers from the united Germany and the Soviet Union
will meet at least twice a year, according to the treaty.
   The document further says that the nations will ``significantly
expand'' their bilateral cooperation, ``especially in the economic,
industrial and economic-technological areas.''

<TEXT>
   A millionaire rancher is locking
horns with the state over a plan to establish an exotic game ranch
on his 18,000-acre spread.
   John Dorrance III, an heir to the Campbell Soup fortune, thumbed
his nose at the state Game and Fish Department two weeks ago when
he brought a dozen mixed breed deer to his ranch bordering Devil's
Tower in northeastern Wyoming.
   Dorrance says he's just trying to make an old-fashioned profit.
He wants to breed the rare animals and sell their lean meat to
fancy restaurants, their hides to clothiers and their horns to
Asians, who say they make great aphrodisiacs.
   ``I'm a threat to the Game and Fish. Let's face it. I'm
something they despise. I've got money and I've got private
property,'' said Dorrance.
   State wildlife officials say that's nonsense. They contend the
animals _ three-way crossbreeds of red deer, sika deer and elk _
could escape, spread disease and inbreed with Wyoming's majestic,
purebred wildlife. The deer were bred in Missouri.
   ``The best guarantee that these animals won't spread disease to
native wildlife is to get them out of the state,'' said agency
spokesman Larry Kruckenberg. ``The bottom line is simple _ we don't
want the animals here or the threats they pose.''
   The controversy has resulted in dueling lawsuits, environmental
outrage and a splash of Wyoming wit.
   While the wildlife agency and environmentalists hardly find
humor in the dispute, Wyoming residents are already lampooning the
great grandson of condensed soup.
   ``What's John Dorrance's ultimate vision? Cream of Sika soup,''
chortles one jokester.
   A local newspaper cartoon suggested that even Bambi will need a
lawyer if Dorrance's plans to create a full scale game ranch with
wild boar, ibex and mouflon sheep were realized.
   But Dorrance maintains he has done nothing illegal because his
dozen hybrid deer are less than 50 percent of any one strain of
species, and are therefore not considered wildlife under Wyoming
law.
   Dorrance calls the deer ``non-traditional livestock'' and are
not under the jurisdiction of the Game and Fish Department.
   ``In bringing these animals into the state, I am simply
exercising my right to pursue free enterprise and to do with my
land as I see fit,'' said the 45-year-old Dorrance, who has been a
rancher for 16 years in the hilly terrain made famous in the movie
``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.''
   ``The animals are legal, free of disease and parasites and
double-fenced. They aren't going to hurt anyone.''
   The wildlife agency disagrees and on Wednesday held a telephone
conference that resulted in an emergency rule that redefines
``exotic wildlife,'' a definition that is at the heart of the
dispute between Dorrance and the department.
   The rule change came too late to cover the 12 animals Dorrance
has already brought in from Missouri, but any others he planned to
bring in would fall under the new rule.
   The department also maintains the new rule wasn't needed to
outlaw Dorrance's hybrids, arguing that since red deer and elk are
essentially the same species, the animals do fall under their
control even under the old rules.
   The rancher says he will continue to fight for his private
property rights, no matter how much it costs.
   ``When I moved here, I thought `Wyoming is what America was.'
Now I think Wyoming wants to be what Russia was _ a bureaucratic
nightmare where everything is controlled by a central government.''

   King Hussein's ceaseless travels in search
of gulf peace have raised scant hope, Jordanian officials admitted
Thursday, but Hussein plans to step up efforts to find a
breakthrough.
   ``The king has no other choice but to keep trying,'' one senior
government official said. ``The alternative is war, a prospect too
horrifying for us to contemplate.''
   Hussein returned Sept. 4 from a nine-day trip to Britain, West
Germany, Italy, Spain and five North African countries. The next
day, he called on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
   He met late Wednesday with Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization, whose own initiatives link
Kuwait to the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The king has said he has no specific peace plan. Instead, he is
throwing out ideas. Although he expressed some optimism to
reporters in London, he has made no comment since returning to
Amman.
   ``He did not find the flexibility he had hoped for in Europe,''
said one official who, like the others interviewed, spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   In every European capital, governments insisted that nothing
less than a total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait would be acceptable.
   King Hussein's approach is to find ground on which Saddam and
his adversaries can edge their way back from the brink.
   ``He feels he has the confidence of Saddam and can help in this
situation,'' one aide said. ``If anyone thinks the Iraqis will
budge if you don't have their confidence, he's mistaken.''
   Jordan has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and the
royal family insists that it is respecting the U.N. trade embargo
that followed.
   But, said one official, echoing the view of others, ``We just
feel that we know the Iraqis well, and we have a different idea
about how to convince them to change their minds. We will not stop
trying.''
   In the Jordanian view, Saddam can be persuaded to pull out of
Kuwait if the conditions allow him to emerge with some aura of
victory among his Arab followers.
   Iraq has said it would only talk about Kuwait in the context of
U.N. resolutions demanding that Israel withdraw from Palestinian
territories in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``He's already brought the Palestinian issue onto the central
stage where no one can ignore it,'' one official noted. ``And he
has established his zone of influence as a geo-economic power.''
   If Saddam can win access to the gulf through a small part of
what was Kuwaiti territory, the official said, reflecting Jordan's
analysis, he might reverse his annexation of Kuwait and withdraw.
   Iraq has only a short strip of coastline in the northern gulf
and has long demanded control of the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and
Warbah, which dominate Iraq's maritime outlets.
   As the United States continues its military buildup and rallies
international support for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal, there
is little chance for any such compromise, the Jordanians
acknowledge.
   But as Saddam enhances his prestige among Arabs by standing firm
against a superior foreign force, and as time hangs heavily on U.S.
troops in the stifling heat of the Saudi Arabian desert, they
expect the picture to change.
   Meantime, King Hussein is positioning his little kingdom to
serve as moderator.
   Jordan habitually seeks middle ground in the Middle East crises
that swirl around it. But the gulf confrontation has squeezed it
from both sides.
   Western leaders charge that Jordan is too close to Iraq,
providing aid and comfort to an international outlaw. Saddam wants
firmer support from his old friend.
   ``Whatever King Hussein might feel, the Jordanians' sympathy for
Saddam's position is evident, and no leader can ignore public
opinion,'' one senior aide said.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury investigating allegations of
misconduct at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant has subpoenaed
a U.S. Department of Energy watchdog committee.
   Merritt Langston, a spokesman for the Advisory Committee on
Nuclear Facility Safety, said today that the subpoena was delivered
to Chairman John Ahearne earlier this week.
   It orders him to turn over all documents pertaining to the
committee's work at Rocky Flats, or send a representative to
testify or both. The subpoena calls for the documents to be
delivered Monday and presented to the grand jury Wednesday.
   Rocky Flats, 16 miles northwest of Denver, is the nation's only
manufacturer of plutonium detonating devices for nuclear warheads.
Plutonium processing at the plant has been suspended since the
beginning of this year because of safety and environmental concerns.
   The Ahearne committee, formed two years ago to look into the
problems, recommended in June that plutonium production not resume
before October at the earliest, if national security needs
warranted it.
   The Denver grand jury investigation began Aug. 1, 1989, two
months after agents of the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency
and the Department of Energy raided the plant, looking for
violations of regulations. The grand jury has issued non in rubber dinghies
before dawn and
fought their way into Jaffna Fort, said Defense Secretary Gen.
Cyril Ranatunga.
   Ten soldiers were also wounded in the battle for the fort, where
more than 200 policemen and soldiers had been trapped, military
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   An air force plane providing air cover crashed into the lagoon
after the siege was broken, military officials said. The pilot of
the single-engine Italian-made Marchetti plane was thought to have
died. Officials blamed the crash on engine failure.
   There was no immediate word from the Tamil Tiger rebels or any
independent report from Jaffna, where communications have been
severed for three months. The 17th century fort had been besieged
since June 11 when the Tamil guerrillas broke a cease-fire and
renewed their separatist war against the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   ``The assaulting battle group has now successfully relieved the
fort and is consolidating and clearing adjacent areas,'' the
military statement said.
   Officials said most of the 200 policemen and soldiers remained
in the fort, while an undisclosed number were evacuated for medical
reasons.
   They said troops were destroying rebel bunkers around the fort.
   The breaking of the siege would be an important psychological
victory for the government forces, but its value would likely be
more symbolic than practical.
   The rest of Jaffna town is Tiger territory, and so is most of
the surrounding Jaffna Peninsula. Jaffna is 185 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   Nevertheless, the massive fort _ a classic of military
architecture with a moat, drawbridge, watch towers and 20-foot
walls _ symbolizes Sinhalese power in the Tamil-dominated peninsula.
   During the siege, helicopters dropped food to the men trapped
inside. Drinking water was provided in the form of ice blocks,
which quickly melted in the tropical heat. At least twice
helicopter pilots braved rebel flak to land at the fort and pick up
seriously wounded policemen and soldiers.
   Having taken the fort, the government's next task is to take the
town of Jaffna, which has been a Tiger stronghold since the
insurrection started in 1983.
   The government opened talks last year to try to negotiate a
peaceful settlement with the Tigers, who say they need a separate
homeland to protect the Tamil minority from discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority.
   The government says more than 3,000 people have been killed in
the last three months, bringing the death toll of the 7-year-old
insurrection to at least 14,000.
   The northeast is the home of most of Sri Lanka's Tamils, who
form 18 percent of the island's population of 16 million. Sinhalese
make up 75 percent of the people.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the
prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said Ahmed Osman.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt,'' was published in Britain
on Thursday by Grafton Books. The U.S. rights are under negotiation.
   Osman's first book in 1987, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named Yuya was Joseph,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of Israel into Egypt.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the Bible in London for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the Egyptian
Embassy, held a reception Thursday night to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying Moses with Ikhnaton, Osman builds on Sigmund
Freud's last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at Jews' College,
University of London, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   Naim Dangoor, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' Dangoor said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that Moses had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye,
daughter of Joseph the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when Moses was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that Moses was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, Ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, Tutankhamen.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in Sinai with
a few followers,'' Osman said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, Ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged Horemheb's general, Ramses, for
the throne but Ramses attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in 1333 B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by Ramses' successor, Seti I.
This fight is recorded in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
Moses and Egypt because of memories of the oppression, Osman
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
Moses became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   Eric Uphill, an Egyptologist at London's University College,
said he helped and supported Osman's research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, Uphill said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with Moses is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' Leperer said.
   Dangoor said Moses' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' Dangoor said.

   The White House denied Thursday that the U.S.
ambassador to Iraq gave President Saddam Hussein any reason to
think President Bush would look the other way if Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
   ``It's pretty ludicrous to suggest that any time any place we
would find it comfortable to have them invade Kuwait _ the basic
implication is that somehow the U.S. would be willing to look the
other way or would have condoned this kind of action,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``That is ludicrous and stupid,'' he said.
   But Fitzwater acknowledged that the administration, before the
Aug. 2 invasion, was trying to develop better ties with Iraq.
   Fitzwater's comments came in response to reporters' questions
about an Iraqi transcript of a conversation between U.S. Ambassador
April Glaspie and Saddam a week before the invasion.
   U.S. officials have not denied the authenticity of the
transcript, in which Glaspie reassured Saddam that the United
States had no official position on ``Arab-Arab conflicts, like your
border disagreement with Kuwait,'' according to a version published
by The Washington Post.
   ``She reflected United States policy,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``At that time we were trying to nurture relations with Iraq,''
he said when asked if Glaspie indicated the United States would not
intervene in Iraq's border dispute with Kuwait.
   On July 31, just three days before the invasion, Assistant
Secretary of State John H. Kelly gave the same answer in testimony
on Capitol Hill as he argued against imposing trade sanctions on
Iraq.
   ``We have historically avoided taking any position on border
disputes or internal OPEC deliberations,'' Kelly said.
   Another official explained U.S. thinking on the Iraq-Kuwait
conflict before the invasion.
   ``Neighbors have had disputes over boundaries and borders for
years. It's not for us to intervene. But ... it's a big
difference'' when a country actually invades another, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fitzwater said Glaspie, a career diplomat, has been stationed at
a State Department desk working on the Iraq matter in Washington
since the invasion. He said that doesn't reflect any
dissatisfaction with her performance.
   ``We believe Ambassador Glaspie is an outstanding
professional,'' Fitzwater said. ``She has represented her country
well and correctly.''
   She was in London, en route to Washington, when the invasion
occurred. In Washington, she was told not to return to Baghdad,
where Joseph C. Wilson III heads the embassy in her absence.
   Glaspie has met with Bush two or three times on the matter, and
is active in State Department deliberations on strategy, Fitzwater
said, adding that she consults daily with her colleagues in Baghdad.
   ``We believe it's most useful that she remain here to help with
our analysis and also that we not send a signal that it's business
as usual with Iraq,'' Fitzwater said.
   He did not dispute the report that Saddam had made menacing
comments to Glaspie in their July 25 meeting in Baghdad, suggesting
that the United States should not oppose Iraqi aims in the Middle
East.
   ``The fact is that Saddam Hussein has lied to everyone in the
world,'' including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's
King Hussein, Fitzwater said. ``The whole world was misled in that
sense.''

   A minor earthquake shook Tel Aviv and its
suburbs Thursday but caused no damage or injuries, a government
official said.
   Dr Avi Shapira, head of the seismological divison of the
Institute for Petrol and Geophysical Research, said the quake
registered 4 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake by
the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. At magnitude of 4, an
earthquake can cause moderate damage.
   However, no damage was reported from the tremor in the Tel Aviv
area, according to the national news agency Itim.
   Israel sits on the Syrian-African rift that runs from southern
Turkey into Africa. Although there are daily tremors along the
rift, they reach a magnitude felt by humans only once or twice a
year, Shapira said.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen on Thursday murdered a Lebanese
militia officer who led a squad of bodyguards assigned to protect
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite while he negotiated for the
release of Western hostages.
   Amin Sleit, 36, a senior officer of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party, was shot in the head, neck
and chest, a police spokesman said.
   The assailants, armed with silencer-equipped pistols, stormed
into Sleit's office in West Beirut and opened fire, said the
spokesman, who under regulations cannot be identified.
   The killers fled in a car. No motive for the crim was
immediately known, the spokesman said.
   Sleit headed a Progressive Socialist Party security group that
was in charge of protecting Waite, 51, before the church envoy
disappeared in West Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987. He also managed a real
estate firm in West Beirut.
   A key security figure in the Socialist Party, Sleit had
unofficially provided protection for many foreigners - potential
targets of Shiite Moslem kidnappers - even before Waite's mission.
   Sleit had strongly advised Waite against going unescorted to a
meeting with representatives of the Islamic Jihad, which holds
American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Waite refused, insisting that a contact had told him he would be
allowed to visit the hostages if he showed up for the meeting
alone. Waite never returned.
   No group has claimed Waite's abduction. Former Irish hostage
Brian Keenan, who was released last month, said Waite has been ill
but is alive.
   ``He was in the same apartment as I was being held in,'' Keenan
said in a recent radio interview. ``I know Terry Waite is alive. I
know he has been ill and the illness I do not think is serious.''
   The Western captives, held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in
Lebanon, include three other Britons in addition to Waite, two West
Germans, an Italian and six Americans.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held Western hostage. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

   The Defense Ministry on Thursday
launched an inquiry into practices at an army training center after
it was revealed that recruits had been forced to eat explosives.
   The ministry confirmed newspaper reports that up to 20 young
soldiers were taken to hospital earlier this week after swallowing
30 grams of explosives in what was described as a regular
initiation ceremony.
   One person killed himself and six others attempted suicide
during the summer at the same recruit training center in Colombier
in the West of Switzerland.
   A ministry spokesman said the army lieutenant at the center of
the explosives incident had been suspended.
   One of the victims, who was not named, told Swiss radio the
``explosives baptism,'' was a routine part of army life.
   The commander of the barracks, Colonel Jean-Pierre Voirol,
described the incident as an innocent, allbeit stupid, joke.

   Farmers in two towns attacked riot police with
eggs, beer bottles and clubs Thursday, wounding at least eight
officers during mass protests against low-priced meat imports.
   Police in Nevers responded with tear gas as some of an estimated
10,000 marchers tried to tear down a fence around a government
building.
   In Chateaureaux, also in central France, police sprayed tear gas
and jets of water to disperse more than 1,200 farmers who set fire
to bales of hay and hurled eggs, tomatoes, firecrackers and stones
at the officers.
   During recent months, French farmers have hijacked numerous
livestock trucks and butchered or burned alive hundreds of animals
in a campaign against low-priced lamb and beef imports from
Britain, East Germany and elsewhere.
   At a news conference coinciding with Thursday's clashes,
Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet said the government would
announce a ``substantial'' emergency aid plan for farmers within
the next few days. He declined to discuss the size of the aid
package and appealed for an end to the violence.
   Farmers came from throughout central France to Nevers, the home
of Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy.
   At one point during an hour-long confrontation, a group of
farmers attacked a police unit with clubs, injuring one officer who
was taken away in an ambulance. In all, eight policemen reportedly
were injured, several by bottles hurled at them.
   Before dispersing, farmers set fire to tires near the city hall
and tore down several traffic signs.
   An estimated 1,000 policemen were deployed along the march
route. Many residents heeded authorities' advice to close shops
along the route, and at about 4 p.m. police blocked off the
entrances to the downtown area to keep out motorists.
   The march was organized to demand increased government support
for farmers, whose earnings have dropped because of a drought as
well as the influx of imports.
   In Strasbourg, the European Parliament on Thursday urged the
European Community to take emergency measures to control the recent
fall in farm prices.
   Prices of meat, vegetables and dairy products have dropped as a
result of East German produce coming onto the market faster than
anticipated.
   Most the attacks by French farmers have been targeted at
shipments from Britain. On Wednesday, leaders of French and British
farmers' unions agreed to urge the EC to adopt emergency measures
to prevent further escalation of the dispute.
   They urged tighter restrictions on beef imports from Eastern
Europe, larger purchases of surplus meat, and speedier payments of
subsidies for sheep farmers.

   Former President Reagan was warmly
welcomed by West German leaders Thursday in a city where large
crowds once protested his visits.
   ``In this historic hour when German unity is becoming reality it
is right that you, a great friend of our country, are here,''
Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Reagan, who is on a 10-day trip with
scheduled stops in Poland, the Soviet Union and Italy.
   Reagan thanked Kohl for a 6,000-pound slab of the Berlin Wall
that is now displayed in the presidential library in Simi Valley,
Calif.
   Kohl said Reagan help encourage the democratic reforms that led
to reunification of East and West Germany, set for Oct. 3.
   Some of the largest European protests against Reagan's
presidency were staged in Bonn.
   Reagan's May 1985 attendance at an international economic summit
was overshadowed by a controversy when he and Kohl visited a war
cemetery in Bitburg where Nazi officers are buried.
   In 1982, at the height of the dispute over stationing U.S.
nuclear missiles in Western Europe, about 200,000 West Germans
massed in Bonn to protest a visit by Reagan.
   But on Thursday, an honor guard greeted Reagan, 79, and his
wife, Nancy, as they arrived in a convoy of black limousines at
President Richard von Weizsaecker's official residence overlooking
the Rhine River.
   ``Sunshine for you,'' von Weizsaecker's wife, Marianne, told
Reagan.
   The Reagans traveled to Bonn following a visit to Berlin, where
the former president chipped at the remnants of the Berlin Wall
with a hammer and chisel.

<TEXT>
   A Canadian Forces Aurora plane
spotted debris today floating in the North Atlantic near where a
Peruvian Boeing 727 carrying 16 people is believed have ditched two
days earlier.
   Transport Canada spokesman Dick Pepper said the Aurora crew
sighted the debris 240 miles southeast of Cape Race.
   A coast guard ship was dispatched to the scene to recover the
debris, Pepper said.
   Earlier, Pepper said the rain and fog off Newfoundland's south
coast was hampering the search for the airliner.
   The jet, owned by Faucett Airlines of Peru and carrying Peruvian
airline crew members and their relatives, disappeared Tuesday
afternoon about 200 miles offshore after the pilot radioed that he
was short of fuel.
   The plane was headed for a refueling stop in Gander,
Newfoundland, en route to Miami from the Mediterranean island of
Malta.
   If it ditched successfully there was only a slim chance the
plane would be afloat after two days, Pepper said. But if the plane
was equipped with life rafts, as the 727 often is, the crew could
have escaped, he said.

<HEAD>Explosion at Plant Manufacturing Nuclear Power Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion and fire hit a plant in Soviet
Central Asia that produces fuel for nuclear power stations, spewing
toxic gas into the airZulus and Xhosas armed with axes, swords and clubs.
   ``It's flattened. It's completely flattened,'' said a stunned
woman who went to one area to search for a friend.
   Thousands of blacks fled the townships with their possessions
piled in wheelbarrows and shopping carts, seeking shelter at
hospitals, schools and churches.
   Natalspruit Hospital officials said 8,000 refugees were huddled
on hospital grounds for protection.
   Police also reported one death in Vosloorus, another
Johannesburg-area township, and said a black policeman was fatally
stabbed in Soweto. Four policemen have been killed in Soweto, the
country's largest township, since Tuesday night.
   White local authorities cut electricity Thursday to Tokoza and
Vosloorus in response to a five-month boycott of bill payments by
residents, the government-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
   Ronnie Mamoepa of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front
said the cutoff would spawn ``a climate which is conducive for the
escalation of violence.''
   Blacks in the townships have refused to pay rent and electricity
charges to protest various grievances. But local governments say
they are broke and will cut services until the bills are paid.
   At least 57 people were killed Wednesday, one of the bloodiest
days since factional battles began on Aug. 12, police said.
   Assault guns and tracer bullets, which start fires, were being
used in the fighting, The Star newspaper reported today.
   Among those killed Wednesday, police said, were 25 Zulu migrant
workers hacked to death at a hostel in Tembisa. At least one man
was beheaded, police said.
   Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement have been
battling Xhosas and other blacks supporting the African National
Congress. The fighting spread from the eastern province of Natal,
where the ANC-Inkatha feud has killed about 5,000 blacks since
1986.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela held talks
earlier this week on trying to stop the violence, but failed to
agree.
   The ANC has accused police of helping instigate the violence,
accusations rejected by the government.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid - the government's
policy of racial separation - but differ over plans for a future
South Africa. The left-leaning ANC favors some degree of government
economic control while Inkatha champions free market measures.
   The two sides are also divided over leadership issues with the
strongly Zulu nationalist Inkatha charging the ANC is
Xhosa-dominated. Many top ANC leaders are Xhosas, but the
organization spurns tribal ties.

<HEAD>Iraq Warns Of Terrorist Attacks Against U.S.</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 8 grafs with further comment from memo, background on
Palestinian groups in Iraq; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq warned the United States today of
possible terrorist attacks against American targets in retaliation
for what it called ``crimes'' and ``insults'' against the Arab and
Islamic nations.
   The warning came in a memorandum handed to the U.S. charge
d'affaires in Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the Iraqi memorandum was
in response to a message given to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry in
Baghdad on Wednesday. The report said the message was from the U.S.
government and was delivered by the U.S. charge d'affaires.
   The U.S. message ``claimed that certain terrorist groups which
have bases in Iraq and are supported by Iraq are preparing for
attacks against targets of the United States and its friends,'' INA
said.
   According to the news agency, the U.S. message warned: ``In the
event of an attack of that sort, President Saddam Hussein should
know that the United States will hold him personally responsible.''
   ``The Iraqi government categorically denies the American
claims,'' today's Iraqi message said, according to the news agency.
   It added: ``The American government and President Bush should
expect that the crimes the United States of America is committing
against the Arab nation and the insult it is directing to the
Islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will undoubtedly produce a
natural reaction from theArab and Islamic masses.'' It was
delivered by Nizar Hamdoun, undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry,
the news agency said.
   The United States has massed troops in Saudi Arabia along that
country's borders with Iraq and Kuwait in response to Baghdad's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Iraqi agency quoted the memorandum as saying the
``allegations'' indicated that the United States ``is looking for a
pretext for an aggression against Iraq.''
   ``Iraq reserves its legitimate right to self-defense, to
reciprocate and to retaliate firmly against these parties if it
becomes target of an aggression,'' INA quoted the memorandum as
saying.
   Fears of terrorist attacks have been fueled by Saddam's calls
for jihad, or Islamic holy war, against the U.S.-led multinational
forces that have assembled in Saudi Arabia.
   Iran joined Wednesday in calling for jihad to force the
Americans out of Saudi Arabia, which houses Islam's holiest shrines
at Mecca and Medina.
   Saddam has garnered support among Arabs by portraying the U.S.
intervention in the Gulf as an invasion, rather than a move to
protect Saudi Arabia.
   His attempt to link an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait to Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories has brought him support
among Palestinians.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, once strongly
opposed to Saddam's wing of the Arab Bath Socialist Party, recently
moved its headquarters from Syria, Iraq's archrival, to Baghdad.
   The group, headed by George Habash, gained fame in the early
1970s after a series of plane hijackings to dramatize the
Palestinian cause.
   Another Palestinian leader, Mohammed Abbas, architect of the
hijack of the Achille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, also has
headquarters in Iraq.

   Iraq warned today of terrorist attacks against American targets
in retaliation for the ``insult'' to Islamic nations represented by
U.S. military presence near holy sites in Saudi Arabia.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the warning was contained in
an official memorandum handed to a U.S. official in Baghdad in
response to an American message delivered Wednesday to the Iraqi
Foreign Ministry.
   The U.S. message ``claimed that certain terrorist groups which
have bases in Iraq and are supported by Iraq are preparing for
attacks against targets of the United States and its friends,'' the
news agency said.
   The memorandum given to the U.S. diplomat, who was not named,
said: ``The Iraqi government categorically denies the American
claims.''
   But it sai: ``The American government and President Bush should
expect that the crimes the United States of America is committing
against the Arab nation and the insult it is directing to the
Islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will undoubtedly produce a
natural reaction from the Arab and Islamic masses.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has been one of Iraq's
strongest backers since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Two
Palestinian leaders linked to past terrorism - George Habash and
Mohammed Abbas - now have their headquarters in Baghdad.
   Meanwhile, British women who have flown to freedom but left
husbands behind in Kuwait say Iraqi soldiers are terrorizing
Western men in the captive nation, and there were reports troops
were searching house to house for more hostages.
   The State Department said it had information that Iraqi troops
were mounting intensified, more systematic searches for American
men in the oil-rich Persian Gulf emirate they seized.
   One evacuee said Kuwaiti resistance fighters who called a
general strike shot some residents who ignored the order.
   Washington pressed on with diplomatic efforts to isolate Iraq.
Secretary of State James Baker III was to fly today to Syria.
   U.S. relations with Syria have in the past been strained over
its support of terrorists but Damascus is an ally in the desert
military standoff with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The trip comes as Iraq rapidly reconciles with neighboring Iran,
which after an eight-year war is showing signs it could help Saddam
poke holes in a U.N.-ordered trade embargo enforced by dozens of
U.S. and other warships.
   But the Tehran Times today quoted an official as denying a
report that Iran had agreed to send food and other supplies to Iraq
in exchange for oil. Saddam earlier this week offered free oil for
Third World nations.
   The League of Red Cross will send medicine to Iraq for children,
pregnant women and the elderly, a spokeswoman for the Geneva-based
organization said today. The spokeswoman, Anne Naef, said a doctor
from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies would travel to
Baghdad within the next few days to assess medical requirements of
both Iraqis and foreign residents.
   She said the doctor had no mandate to go to Kuwait. Iraq has not
allowed another group, the Swiss International Committee of the Red
Cross, into Kuwait.
   Tens of thousands of foreigners remained trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait, and masses of mostly penniless Asian refugees were still
stranded in camps in neighboring Jordan awaiting transportation to
their homelands.
   Egypt said today that its diplomats have followed other foreign
envoys in abandoning their embassies in Kuwait. Iraqi troops have
besieged the U.S. and other missions that remained staffed, trying
to starve them out. Power and water have also been cut to many
missions, making conditions insufferable.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said Iraqi authorities searching for American men in Kuwait are
tightening the dragnet.
   ``In Kuwait, there has been increased harassment of U.S.
citizens, and more systematic house-to-house searches for American
men are now being conducted,'' he said.
   Boucher also said the 80 or so Americans who have been rounded
up for use as human shields to deter a feared U.S. attack are being
moved continually. All are believed held in Iraq.
   About 1,400 Americans remain in Kuwait while there are about 200
in Iraq, according to official estimates.
   Concern for the safety of those held hostage by the Iraqis ran
deep among the more than than 400 women and children who comprised
the latest planeload of Westerners allowed to leave Baghdad by Iraq
authorities.
   All had reached the Iraq capital from Kuwait.
   One British woman who arrived in London on the Iraqi Airways 747
Wednesday night said she was forced to leave her 19-year-old son in
the hands of Iraqi soldiers so she and her daughter could gain
their freedom.
   About 280 Americans were on the jumbo jet, which was chartered
by the U.S. and British governments. They were to fly on to
Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina today.
   More than 900 Americans have left Iraq and Kuwait in recent days
and an additional flight is scheduled for Friday.
   Mrs. Walters, who said her husband was in hiding in Kuwait, told
of Iraqi soldiers terrorizing Western men in the emirate:
   ``One (British) man was taken off into the desert, blindfolded
and told to get out of the car and then they threatened to kill
him. He was then pushed back into the car and they drove him round
again and did the same, threatening to kill him again. They were
terrorizing him just for the sheer hell of it.''
   Another Briton, Deborah Ahmed, told of Iraqi troops shooting
Kuwaitis. ``The Iraqis are shooting people and burning their houses
down for writing slanderous graffiti against them,'' Mrs. Ahmed
said.
   One Jordanian computer expert on the flight said Kuwaiti
resistance fighters were occasionally firing on civilians.
   ``This has been happening for the past three or four days,'' he
said. ``The Iraqi government asked everyone to go to work. The
Kuwaiti resistance asked everyone not to go to work but schools
opened and the Iraqis asked all teachers to go to work. The other
day the Kuwaiti resistance shot a teacher and his wife for going to
work.''
   Baker's 24-hour trip to Damascus marks the Bush administration's
first major face-to-face contact with Syria. Improved ties between
the countries could accelerate President Hafez Assad's move back
into the Arab mainstream after years of militancy.
   Assad, heavily dependent on aid from the pro-American Persian
Gulf Arab states, was quick to condemn the Iraqi invasion.
   When the United States began massing troops in Saudi Arabia, he
rallied behind it and sent 4,000-5,000 soldiers to join other Arab
forces.
   The U.S. military buildup in the region, though adequate to
defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq, won't be completed for about two
months, the U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia was quoted today as
saying.
   That's about a month later than earlier reported.
   Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, in an interview published in
the Washington Post, attributed at least part of the slowdown to
breakdowns of some of the Navy's fast transport ships, which he
said has forced the use of slower vessels. About 150,000 American
troops have been deployed in the region.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
visited American troops in Saudi Arabia today and discussed the
military buildup.
   Some nations have indicated they may increase their role in the
gulf.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said today the United
States could count on German solidarity in the gulf crisis, but he
would not elaborate.
   West Germany has sent five minesweepers and two supply ships to
the eastern Mediterranean to support the U.S. fleet.
   The Dutch government announced today it was sending a third Navy
ship to the gulf on Nov. 19. The supply ship Zuiderkruis will sail
along with two frigates that will replace two Dutch ships in the
multinational flotilla.

   Angry neighbors who witnessed a fatal

and his passengers, pummeling them with fists, and pelting them
with fruits and vegetables, police said.
   Pablo Flores, 84, was dead on arrival at Temple University

<HEAD>Company Stuck With Four High-Tech Furnaces Sues Iraq</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON - A company stuck with four multimillion-dollar
furnaces that the Bush administration first approved and then
disapproved for shipment to Iraq filed a $62 million suit Thursday
against Saddam Hussein's government.
   The federal court suit by Consarc Corp. claims that Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait and Iraqi deception over how the
high-temperature furnaces would be used resulted in losses for the
industrial furnace builder and its sister company in Scotland.
   Consarc, of Rancocas, N.J., cited U.S. assertions that the
equipment could help give Iraq the ability to make nuclear weapons.
Two of the furnaces were to be shipped from the United States and
two others from Scotland.
   President Bush told Congress on Tuesday that his administration
had stopped shipment of the furnaces even before the international
embargo imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq says the furnaces were to be used to produce badly needed
artificial limbs for casualties in its long war with Iran.
   Bush told Congress the furnaces ``had the potential to
contribute to Iraq's nuclear capability.''
   The Commerce Department, however, had given permission for their
shipment and the first furnace was stopped at a Philadelphia dock
July 20, after concerns were raised by members of Congress and the
Defense Department.
   Commerce had approved the shipment even though Consarc had
informed government officials as early as February 1989, when the
contract was being drawn up, that the furnaces could be used to
melt materials for use in nuclear weapons, according to documents
obtained by The Associated Press last month.
   The company could still seek legal redress against the U.S.
government for its actions in approving and then blocking the
shipment, but Consarc has indicated it has no such plans.
   The suit asks for $7 million in losses and up to $55 million in
punitive damages against Iraq. The original $11 million contract to
purchase the furnaces was accompanied by a statement from Iraq that
they would be used for work ``in material science technology'' and
not for any ``nuclear application.''
   But Consarc said it was advised on July 20 by the U.S.
government that Iraq had made misleading representations about the
intended use of the furnaces and that they were actually to be used
for the production of nuclear and other military weapons.
   Earlier this month, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohamed
Sadiq Al-Mashat, issued a statement denying that any military use
was planned for the furnaces.
   ``Iraq needs these furnaces to purify, melt and cast metals to
be used in producing artificial limbs for the thousands of
unfortunate people who lost limbs during the eight-year war with
Iran, and finds it most inhumane to prevent or delay the
acquisition of equipment that will be used for their benefit,'' the
ambassador said.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses the Iraqi
Ministry of Industry and Minerals of fraudulently inducing Consarc
to build and ship the furnaces without disclosing that they were
destined for a military-industrial complex outside Baghdad.
   The Treasury Department authorized the lawsuit, which is a first
step required before Consarc can seek to receive payment from Iraqi
funds deposited in the United States and Great Britain.

<DATELINE>ORONO, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Red lobsters once adorned Maine license
plates. Now there's talk of stamping them out with a bear paw
print.
   The University of Maine Alumni Association wants to persuade the
Legislature to approve an idea to reward university supporters with
vanity license plates bearing some likeness of the school mascot.
   ``As a schmaltzy alumni director, I'd like to see a black bear
or bear paw print,'' said H. Maxwell Burry, executive director of
the association.
   The suggestion comes months after the Legislature approved a
bill allowing motorists to obliterate the red lobster now on Maine
tags, so long as the numbers and letters stay intact.
   Some people think the likeness of the lobster crawling across
Maine plates since 1987 gives the wrong impression that Maine is a
place for the rich.
   The school's alumni would be able to get the vanity plates by
paying an extra fee, which would go back to the alumni association.
The university trustees will consider the bear paw proposal Monday.

<HEAD>Powell Says Morale High But Rotations Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States hopes to begin
rotating troops in Saudi Arabia to give them a break from the
desert heat and allow them a chance to see their families,
America's top military officer said today.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said after a whirlwind tour of several American base camps morale
was remarkably high despite the harsh conditions.
   But at each stop he faced at least one question on the expected
length of the U.S. deployment. In the desert and at a news
conference after his visits, Powell was unable to provide an
answer.
   ``I want to get you home as fast as possible but bear with me,''
he told members of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). ``I
can't give you an exact date. ... But don't think I ever forget
that you have loved ones back home.''
   At the news conference, Powell said the U.S. deployment was
behind schedule because of trouble with ships and the military's
limited airlift capacity.
   But overall, he said, the deployment of ``well, well over
100,000'' American troops and thir equipment had gone well.
   Asked about pay cuts faced by many of the troops, Powell said he
empathized with the troops and their families but had to be sure
any resolution treated soldiers deployed in other dangerous
locations of the world equally.
   The loss of the Basic Allowance for Subsistence has been cited
by many troops as a potential morale problem, joining the heat,
boredom, and separation from families on what appears to be a
growing list.
   But Powell said that during his eight-hour tour of U.S. camps he
found the troops ``adjusting rather well.''
   He said he could not say how long the U.S. deployment would
last, but said he told troops ``We'll try to get you home as soon
as possible and we will start rotations as soon as possible.''
   He did not say when that might be.
   Powell was spending the night in nearby Bahrain and planned to
visit a Navy ship on Friday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress took its first step toward long-term
forest protection legislation Thursday as a House subcommittee
approved a bill opposed by both environmentalists and the timber
industry.
   On a 19-13 vote, the House Interior Subcommittee on National
Parks and Public Lands approved a bill by chairman Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn.
   Industry leaders oppose the proposed Ancient Forest Act of 1990
because it would establish a forest preserve where logging would be
banned at least temporarily across 6.3 million acres of the Pacific
Northwest.
   Environmentalists are critical of the proposal because it would
set minimum timber harvest levels that they argue are too high to
protect the future of the old-growth forest ecosystems.
   Vento's bill includes logging prohibitions across about 3
million acres of Northwest forests that a panel of government
scientists said in April are critical to the survival of the
threatened northern spotted owl.
   The measure moves to the full House Interior Committee.

   The professor whose teaching inspired the film
``Dead Poets Society'' says he isn't really interested in poetry, a
subject he doesn't believe is practical for today's college
students.
   ``I don't even think college is practical, so I don't think it
makes any difference,'' said Samuel F. Pickering Jr., an English
professor at the University of Connecticut.
   Tom Schulman, a student Pickering taught 25 years ago, wrote the
screenplay for ``Dead Poets Society'' and based fictional
prep-school teacher John Keating on Pickering.
   In the film, actor Robin Williams as Keating motivates his
students with an off-the-wall teaching style and his message of
``carpe diem,'' Latin for ``seize the day.''
   Pickering, addressing Pittsburgh-area teachers Wednesday at a
poetry forum, has admitted to some of Keating's tactics, including
lecturing from a desk top and from outside a window.
   ``I quote a lot of poetry - if I can remember it,'' he said.
``Maybe it teaches them to think and to see things and hear things
in a different way.''
   Pickering, 48, an essayist, told the teachers he finds
inspiration for writing in ordinary events. Eating breakfast with
his three young children gives him more to write about than hours
of heavy contemplation.

   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Sandy Dennis, who has earned an Academy Award
and two Tony Awards during her acting career, says she never goes
to the movies and would rather read a good book.
   Miss Dennis, at work here on the set of Sean Penn's film ``The
Indian Runner,'' also said her favorite film is not ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?'' for which she won an Oscar in 1965 for
supporting actress.
   It's ``Thank You All Very Much,'' an obscure 1969 British film
about a girl who must raise a child she had out of wedlock.
   ``People always think that awards are very important, and they
were very nice, I don't mean that, but they were never anything I
thought that much about,'' Miss Dennis said after her first morning
of filming Monday in Ralston.
   Miss Dennis, 53, said she never sees the movies she has made and
does not consider herself a fan of film or the theater.
   ``I never go to the theater or films,'' she said, adding that
she would rather read a good book at her home in Westport, Conn.
   Penn is making his directing debut with ``The Indian Runner,''
based on a family living in the Plattsmouth area and set in 1968.
The film is scheduled for release in the fall of 1991.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Trumpeter Al Hirt says he's planning a fourth
trip down the aisle when he weds Beverly Essel in her hometown of
Minnetonka, Minn., this winter.
   He has known Ms. Essel, a recent widow and former dancer with
Horace Heidt's band, for 40 years, according to his son-in-law, Ron
Caron.
   Hirt and Ms. Essel plan to marry Dec. 29.
   Hirt, who won a Grammy Award in 1963, has recorded more than 50
albums and ran a nightclub in the French Quarter here for 22 years
until a sluggish local economy forced him to close it in 1983.
   Now on the road with a five-piece back-up band, Hirt is looking
for a new home in New Orleans for him and the group, Caron said.
   Hirt divorced his third wife, Zide Jahnche Hirt, in May 1989,
after a bitter court fight.

   Baseball owners on Thursday unanimously
approved the appointment of Broadway producer Robert Nederlander as
the New York Yankees new general partner, replacing George
Steinbrenner.
   The vote followed the recommendation of the ownership committee,
which met with Nederlander for two hours Wednesday to discuss
financial disclosures and his plans for the last-place team.
   ``He was very impressive,'' Commissioner Fay Vincent said.
   Nederlander's approval required a three-fourths vote of American
League owners and a majority of National League owners. It came
during the second day of the owners' two-day quarterly meetings.
   Steinbrenner, one of baseball's most controversial owners for
nearly two decades, resigned Aug. 20 following Vincent's
investigation into his ties with gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner
is permitted no day-to-day involvement in the Yankees' baseball
operations.
   ``I am honored that Major League Baseball has approved me,'' the
57-year-old Nederlander said in a statement. He has been a limited
partner in the Yankees' organization since 1973.
   The Nederlander Organization owns 30 theaters in the U.S. and
Britain including 11 Broadway theaters. The family is considered
the second-most powerful in American theater, behind the Shuberts.
   Nederlander has presented such Broadway hits as ``Annie,''
``Nicholas Nickleby'' and ``La Cage aux Folles.''

<HEAD>IRS Says Unsigned Forms Could Cost $22.6 Million in Lost Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service disclosed
Thursday that its failure to sign 31 documents could cost 22.6
million in lost taxes.
   The agency confirmed a report by a private group, the Coalition
of IRS Whistleblowers, that the errors had been made. But the IRS
rejected the coalition's estimate that the mistakes involved 1
million tax returns and $13 billion or more in revenue.
   In fact, said IRS spokesman Frank Keith, the foulup involved
10,700 tax returns and additional tax assessments totaling $46
million. Since the problem was discovered, he said, the IRS has
issued new assessments for $23.4 million in 7,600 of those cases.
   Keith said the three-year statute of limitations has expired in
the other 3,100 cases, involving a maximum of $22.6 million, much
of which already has been paid by taxpayers. Any of that money paid
during the last two years will be refunded without further action
by the taxpayer, Keith said, adding that the agency has no
authority to rebate payments made more than two years ago.
   Keith said the problem involves IRS Form 23C, a summary document
or cover letter. That form must be signed before additional taxes
can be assessed against the tax returns to which it is attached.
One form can cover hundreds of thousands of returns and other tax
documents.
   The IRS discovered recently that 31 of those forms had not been
signed over the last five years.
   Paul DesFosses, president of the private group, affiliated with
the Church of Scientology, told a news conference Wednesday, ``This
incredible mistake makes the shredding and toilet-bowl flushing of
tax returns in past years look trivial in comparison.''
   The coalition, composed principally of former IRS employees,
obtained 25 pages of internal IRS documents, dated April 12, 1990,
that explained to field offices how the snafu should be handled.
   ``Since the assessments were not properly made, all subsequent
actions taken in reliance on a properly assessed liability were
invalid,'' one document reads.
   The same document cautions that ``if the validity of our
assessments is suspect, we will be faced with constant challenges
to our collections actions. ... We must ensure that taxpayer
contacts are handled timely, consistently and professionally to
minimize any loss of confidence by the public.
   Keith said that during the five-year period when 31 Forms 23C
were not signed, the IRS properly processed 20,000 of them and
assessed additional taxes in 250 million cases.
   ``However, we expect taxpayers to follow the law, and we have to
do the same thing,'' Keith added. ``Fair play requires that we make
refunds in these cases where the law allows.''
   In estimating that the mistake could cost the government $13
billion or more, the coalition relied on a sample Form 23C that
covered one week's work at the IRS Service Center in Ogden, Utah.
That form summarized 256,054 returns and other tax documents and
authorized additional assessments totaling $2.6 billion.
   The coalition knew that five of the 31 unsigned forms were
weekly compilations (26 were daily reports) and concluded that if
the weekly report from Ogden was typical, the five forms could
cover assessments of $13 billion or more. The IRS statement
indicates the Ogden report actually was far larger than the
average.

   In a quiet hollow of the Berkshires where
the clear waters of the North River chatter over smooth brown
stones, one of the last covered bridges in Massachusetts is about
to make a move.
   This weekend, three teams of oxen will haul the Arthur A. Smith
bridge off its moorings and onto the riverbank for repairs.
Townsfolk want to restore the rickety structure to the days when
wagonloads of lumber rumbled over its sturdy planks and courting
couples stole kisses in its dark recesses.
   ``We lose so much of our heritage,'' says Arnold Graton who is
overseeing the move and restoration. ``We've got to keep striving
to hold on to what there is left.''
   To fix up their tattered bridge, residents of this tiny farming
community in the foothills of the Berkshires have held raffles,
sold T-shirts and sought donations in their quest to restore the
last survivor of the 18 covered bridges that once dotted Colrain's
landscape.
   ``It's mostly sentiment,'' said Phillips Sherburne, town
selectman and a member of the Colrain Historical Society. ``Some
members of the historical society stole their first kisses there.''
   It will be the second time the bridge has moved. Built in 1870 a
few miles down river, it was moved to its present site in 1896. It
has been closed since 1982.
   So far, $30,000 has been raised and supporters believe they can
get the remaining $70,000 in the one to two years estimated for
repair.
   In preparation for Sunday's move, workers have lifted the
99-foot bridge up on blocks of timber and slipped smooth round logs
underneath, ready to roll. The timbers, eaten away by moisture, are
bound together with stout cables.
   ``You sometimes wonder what keeps the old bridge together
because it's pretty tender,'' said Graton, whose family has
specialized in the art of moving and restoring covered bridges for
35 years.
   To keep things authentic, Graton will bring in three teams of
oxen for the big move.
   ``The old-timers would have used oxen and that creates an event
that today's people would never see. We like to create a use for
the old tradition,'' he said. ``Plus, the oxen are quiet and calm.
They move real slow and ... we can't pinch our fingers or anything
like that.''
   Wednesday, workers shoveled loads of dirt out of the way and
straightened out the long ramps down which the bridge will roll.
   All was quiet except for the rustle of wind in the corn and the
high-pitched hum of insects. Except for the utility poles striding
across the landscape, it was easy to imagine the days when the
covered bridge represented the latest in technology.
   The trusses, covered for protection from the elements, allowed
builders to make longer bridges and were a revolution for their
times, said David Wright, president of the Boston-based Society for
the Preservation of Covered Bridges.
   At one time, thousands of bridges spanned rivers across the
country, but only about 850 are left, he said. In Massachusetts,
only four of the old bridges still stand in their original sites.
   In recent years, the antique structures have inspired several
save-the-bridge efforts, and Wright said the enthusiasm isn't hard
to understand.
   ``They're very beautiful things. They are very precious remnants
of another way of looking at things,'' he said.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee today opened
confirmation hearings on Supreme Court nominee David Souter, and he
told the panel it was ``inappropriate to comment'' on the 1973
ruling that legalized abortion.
   In his opening moments as witness for his own nomination, Souter
told the panel that the Constitution provided an unwritten right to
privacy, the basis for the Supreme Court's abortion ruling of 17
years ago.
   Souter began his trip through the confirmation gauntlet after
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the committee chairman, appealed to him
for a ``glimpse into your heart'' on issues such as privacy and
equal rights.
   The Supreme Court has been deeply divided in recent years with
5-4 rulings on many contentious issues such as abortion and civil
rights. Conservatives were hoping that if confirmed, Souter would
help anchor the court firmly on the right.
   Speaking in a clipped New England accent, Souter made an opening
pledge that if he were confirmed he would work to preserve the
Constitution and the rights it bestows ``for the generations that
will follow us after we are gone from here.''
   Sitting at a table covered by orange felt, Souter said he had
learned two lessons as a judge - that rulings affect individuals,
and that ``we had better use every power of our minds and our
hearts and our beings to get those rulings right.''
   The morning session of the committee was consumed by speeches by
the senators on the panel. Souter sat quietly listening to them.
   Biden said lawmakers had a ``duty to discover'' his views on a
range of issues that might come before the court. He did not single
out abortion.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, in sentiments echoed by other
Republicans, said, ``We are certainly not here to find out how you
will rule on various issues before the court.''
   When it came time for questions, Biden assured Souter that he
was free to refuse to answer any he deemed improper.
   With that, the Delaware Democrat bore in on the issue of
privacy, questioning him about a case involving a married couple's
right to use birth control.
   Souter quickly agreed that the Constitution provides an
``unenumerated right to privacy'' - and Biden said he was pleased
to hear that.
   But Souter repeatedly refused to be drawn into any comment on
the right to abortion - an issue which he noted had been on
``everyone's minds and lips since the moment of my nomination.''
   It would be ``inappropriate to comment'' on the Roe vs. Wade
ruling, he said.
   The hearings are expected to continue for at least two days.
   The session was interrupted briefly when a dozen people,
claiming to represent the gay rights group ACT UP, loudly protested
the nomination. Capitol Police arrested the six men and six women
and said each had been charged with disrupting a congressional
hearing and demonstrating within a Capitol building.
   Souter is a former New Hampshire attorney general who was
confirmed to federal appeals court earlier this year. He remains
something of a legal enigma to the many conservative and liberal
groups who have scoured his record since his nomination on July 23
to succeed retiring Justice William Brennan.
   The American Bar Association has given Souter its top rating for
qualifications. Some groups, including the National Organization
for Women, have come out against Souter, while others have reserved
judgment. There has been no outcry from liberals similar to the one
that preceded the rejection of Robert Bork's nomination during the
Reagan administration, however, and no predictions that the
Democratic-controlled Senate will defeat the nomination.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he was concerned there was
``little in his record that demonstrates real solicitude for the
rights of those who are weakest and most powerless in our
society.''
   ``The burden of proof rests with those who support a
nomination,'' he said, calling on Souter to make his positions
clear.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the questioning should not
include ``direct questioning about sensitive issues that may come
before the court.''
   Democrat Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio said the White House had
sought to reassure the GOP right wing that Souter was their kind of
nominee. ``Does John Sununu know something which we don't?'' he
said, referring to Bush's chief of staff.
   ``We are not asking for any commitments as to how you would rule
on any specific case,'' Biden said as he gaveled the televised
hearings into session. ``Nor are we trying to pry into your
personal views on publicly debated issues.''
   Biden said that while he was not seeking commitments from
Souter, he was determined to learn more about his views.
   ``We want to know what principles you would apply - what
philosophies you would employ - as you exercise the awesome power
you will hold if you are confirmed as a justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court.''
   Biden said this is a moment in history when the court's
long-term direction is at stake.
   ``At this fateful moment in our history we have a right to know
- and a duty to discover - precisely what you, Judge David Hackett
Souter, think about the great constitutional questions of our
time.''
   These, he said, include the right to privacy, equal rights for
women and all races, and First Amendment protections of speech and
religion.
   The 50-year-old federal appeals judge's approach to the law is
undoubtedly conservative but there's not enough in the record to
say, for example, how he would vote on the 1973 abortion rights
ruling now being challenged by the Bush administration.
   In addition, many of the judge's friends are political moderates
or liberals.
   Since being chosen by Bush on July 23 to replace Brennan, Souter
paid courtesy calls on committee members. But he sidestepped issues
with either them or the news media, saying he would wait for his
confirmation hearings.
   Souter is a ``tough, fair-minded, intellectually brilliant
judge,'' President Bush said following a meeting with Souter
Wednesday.

<HEAD>House Delays Action on Defense Bill as Budget Talks Drag on</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday postponed action on the
$283 billion defense bill as congressional and White House
negotiators held out the possibility of an agreement on trimming
the federal deficit.
   Lawmakers remained optimistic about resolving sometime soon the
drawn-out dispute over how to pare $50 billion from the budget for
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   A key component of any agreement would be the total for military
spending in fiscal 1991.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters the
postponement was designed ``to give our negotiators a little
opportunity.'' Work on the defense bill will resume Monday
afternoon.
   The postponement was an acknowledgment of the logistical
problems the House has avoided for the last two days.
   Action on the bill has involved general debate during the day
and votes in the late afternoon, a move designed to prevent
interruptions of budget negotiators' meetings at Andrews Air Force
Base, 20 minutes from the Capitol.
   On Thursday, however, much of the general debate on the
legislation had been completed and votes were scheduled throughout
the day on such thorny issues as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Meanwhile, the White House, which already has threatened a veto
of the bill because it would cut troop strength and end the B-2
stealth bomber program, criticized a measure the House approved
Wednesday on U.S. troops in Japan.
   ``We don't believe that's an appropriate way to conduct foreign
policy,'' said presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Frustrated by Japan's delay in giving $1 billion to the U.S.
Pesian Gulf operation, which could cost up to $15 billion in the
next year, the House agreed Wednesday to require Tokyo to pay all
the costs of stationing U.S. forces on its soil, or begin losing
the troops.
   The amendment was one of three burden-sharing proposals added to
the bill by lawmakers who have lashed out at America's friends and
their contributions to the campaign against Iraq. Some members of
Congress complain that U.S. allies should pay for a greater share
of the Persian Gulf operation.
   Fitzwater noted that the vote ``does express the sentiment of
the Congress. I think Japan is aware of the general feeling in the
Congress toward some of their activities.''

   Iran's reported food-for-oil deal with
its old adversary Iraq could allow Tehran to boost its oil exports
and earn nearly $2 billion more a year at current prices, oil
experts said Thursday.
   That would be a bonus for cash-strapped Iran, which has already
gained politically from the gulf crisis and reportedly made
economic gains as well.
   A well-informed source in Tehran said Tuesday that Iran had
agreed to allow ``humanitarian shipments'' of food and medicine
into neighboring Iraq, despite U.N. sanctions imposed following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   He said that in return, Iraq agreed to give Iran 200,000 barrels
of refined Iraqi oil a day for free and pay an undisclosed amount
of money.
   The source said the deal was struck during a visit Sunday by
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz.
   He said Iraq offered to pay in oil for essentials Tehran allowed
across the border. He said Iran refused to accept full payment in
oil, but agreed to take up to 200,000 barrels a day of refined
products.
   Aziz, the first senior Iraqi official to visit Iran in 15 years,
was accompanied by Oil Minister Isam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi.
   The Tehran Times, a daily newspaper close to Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's government, denied that Iran would take Iraqi
oil.
   It quoted an unidentified ``informed source'' in Tehran as
saying the government had not decided whether to allow shipments
into Iraq.
   U.S. State Department officials said they believe Tehran will
abide by the sanctions, as it has said it would.
   The Tehran Times quoted its source as saying that if Iran
decided to allow shipments into Iraq, ``it is only out of
humanitarian considerations, as we believe innocent Iraqi people
are not rsponsible for their government's move.''
   Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based newsletter
Petrostrategies, said in a telephone interview that Iran ``probably
could supply enough food to the right people and places to keep the
Iraqi economy going'' for awhile.
   Iran's oil refineries, damaged during the 1980-88 war with Iraq,
are producing about 600,000 barrels of fuel and other products a
day.
   Domestic demand is about 750,000 barrels, so the Iranians have
been importing 150,000 barrels a day, paid for in scarce foreign
currency.
   By bringing in refined oil from Iraq, oil experts say Tehran
would be able to halt costly imports of refined products and sell
an equivalent amount of its own crude on top of its current
exports.
   Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris, said that at $25 a barrel,
200,000 barrels of oil could bring in $5 million dollars a day for
Iran.
   Iran is currently pumping about 3.1 million barrels of oil a
day, its maximum capacity.
   Bogin said the reported Iranian move was probably ``more a
gesture to Iraq'' than an effort to capitalize on Baghdad's plight.
   ``Iran must be considering its geographical position next to
Iraq,'' he said.
   Desmond Harney, an expert on Iran with the London-based Middle
East Consultants, said that Iran's move also was probably motivated
by domestic politics.
   The Iranian hierarchy is split between so-called pragmatists,
who want to normalize ties with the West and attract investment and
technology, and anti-Western radicals, who insist on continued
hostility toward the West.

   Youths with spears and
machetes went on a rampage Thursday in a black commuter train,
hacking to death at least 26 people and injuring about 100 as
terrified passengers lept from the speeding coaches.
   Police gave no reason for the attack, which came after black
faction fighting left at least 13 other people dead Thursday in
townships around Johannesburg.
   Witnesses at the train station told The Associated Press that
about 10 black youths, most in their late teens, boarded the train
at the Jeppe Station in Johannesburg and began attacking passengers
as the train was moving.
   Another gang of men was waiting for the train when it pulled
into the next stop, George Goch station, about five minutes later.
They began shooting and stabbing the screaming passengers as they
tried to flee.
   Passeners jumped from the train or tried to hide under seats as
the youths stabbed and hacked people in the coaches. The dead
included elderly women and men who were unable to run away.
   ``They worked their way down the coaches very systematically,
killing people. They were well-organized and spoke to each other as
they attacked people,'' said one man at George Goch station, where
the train was halted.
   Bodies littered coach floors and pools of blood formed along the
platform. Scores of screaming passengers pushed and shoved to get
off the train as it stopped, witnesses said.
   The attackers jumped from the train just before it reached the
George Goch station and escaped, witnesses said. The gang waiting
on the platform also fled.
   ``We cannot live like this in South Africa,'' said a black
police officer looking at the contorted bodies of four people piled
on the floor of one car.
   Police commanders said they did not know who the attackers were,
but two officers at the scene said the youths were Zulus. A train
conductor said he heard the youths speaking Zulu.
   Hundreds of heavily armed police and army troops in battle gear
cordoned off the area. Army patrols with assault rifles walked
along railway tracks, hunting for bodies.
   Two helicopters evacuated injured people to hospitals as
ambulances carried other wounded away.
   In other violence Thursday, police said seven people died and
about 400 houses and shacks were burned in pre-dawn fighting at the
Tokoza township between Zulus and other blacks armed with axes,
swords and clubs.
   ``It's flattened. It's completely flattened,'' said a stunned
woman who searched the area for a friend.
   Thousands of blacks fled Tokoza and other townships around
Johannesburg with their possessions piled in wheelbarrows and
shopping carts, seeking shelter at hospitals, schools and churches.
   Police also reported one death in Vosloorus and said five
blacks, including a policeman, were killed in Soweto. Four
policemen have been killed in Soweto, the country's largest
township, since Tuesday night.
   More than 700 people have died since the fighting in townships
around Johannesburg erupted Aug. 12. The main combatants are Zulus
loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement and Xhosas and other
blacks supporting the African National Congress.
   The fighting spread from the eastern province of Natal, where
the ANC-Inkatha feud has killed about 5,000 blacks since 1986.
   The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black political movements,
both oppose South Africa's system of racial segregation but differ
over tactics and plans for a future South Africa.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu renewed his plea for peace
Thursday, citing the words of the late Martin Luther King, Jr.
   ``Martin Luther King said that if we allow the law of an
`eye-for-an-eye' to operate, then we will end up with blind
people,'' Tutu said on government-run televison. ``Unless we learn
to live as brothers and sisters, we will die like fools.''
   Chris Hani, head of the ANC's armed wing, said Wednesday the
country was in an ``undeclared war'' and that the ANC must defend
its supporters. He did not say what action the ANC might take.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said ANC criticism of him
and his movement was stirring up political passions and making the
violence worse.
   ``I object very strongly when ANC propaganda viciously attacks
... me personally in order to make me look like a piece of scum
before all the world,'' he said.
   In other developments, white local authorities cut electricity
Thursday in the Tokoza and Katlehong townships in response to a
five-month boycott of bill payments by residents.
   Ronnie Mamoepa of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front
denounced the move, saying it created a climate that could lead to
more violence.
   Blacks in townships near Johannesburg have refused to pay rent
and electricity charges to protest a host of grievances. Local
governments say they are broke and will cut services until the
bills are paid.

   The Bush administration voiced strong
objections Thursday to legislation that would authorize a $60
million payment to the Seneca Nation and allow a New York community
to continue leasing the Indian land.
   The bill, introduced by Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., calls for a
federal payment of $35 million and a New York state payment of $25
million as compensation for inequities under the former agreement,
which in some cases resulted in rents as low as $1 a year.
   But Walter R. Mills, deputy to the assistant secretary of Indian
affairs in the Department of the Interior, told the Interior and
Insular Affairs Committee that the administration opposes an
agreement reached by the city of Salamanca and the Indian nation to
replace a 99-year lease that expires Feb. 19, 1991.
   ``The United States is being asked to commit $35 million as
compensation to the Seneca Nation for a lease arrangement approved
100 years ago by an act of Congress,'' Mills said. ``It is not
clear that the federal government is liable under the terms of the
lease agreement.''
   In 1890, Congress approved the 99-year leases on Seneca land in
western New York at extremely low rents, with no provision for
raising the payments.
   ``No amount of money could compensate us for what we have
lost,'' said Dennis Lay, president of the Seneca Nation.
``Nevertheless, the $60 million we are to receive under the
settlement will enable the nation to make great progress in vital
social and economic areas.''

<HEAD>Soldiers of Fortune Say Saddam Hussein Must Be ``Taken Out''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some years past, delegates to the annual
Soldiers of Fortune convention have had to search the globe to find
wars worth fighting and enemies worth killing.
   There is no such dilemma this year.
   For the mercenary set, the Persian Gulf crisis is the stuff that
dreams are made of. There has been dreaming aplenty this week at
the convention sponsored by Soldier of Fortune magazine, the
Boulder, Colo.-based publiciation that appeals to veterans,
mercenaries and those with a richly violent fantasy life.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was the central figure at this
year's convention, albeit in absentia. Delegates were generally in
agreement that Hussein must be ``taken out,'' whether it be by the
military, his own commanders or a ``black bag'' operation.
   ``He's gotta be taken out, one way or the other,'' said retired
Army Lt. Col. Robert Brown, editor and publisher of Soldier of
Fortune.
   ``Most likely someone in his group will assassinate him,''
predicted Ray Cline, a professor at Georgetown University and a
former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
``Assassination is a way of life in that regime. He's an assassin
himself.
   ``I think his next step will be unleashing a wave of
anti-American terrorism,'' predicted Cline, who was with the CIA
during the Cuban missile crisis. ``We have to treat him like a
deranged murderer.''
   Brown, a Special Forces leader in Vietnam, refers to the Iraqi
leader as Saddam Insane, calling him ``a wily, foxy zealot.'' He
says he knows of Americans who have been approached about ``taking
out'' Saddam in a ``black bag'' or covert assassination attempt.
   Any such attempt is unlikely by a ``freelance'' assassin, Brown
believes.
   ``If Hussein is going to be taken out, it won't be by private
effort,'' he said Wednesday as registration for the convention
began. ``Americans don't blend into the culture of the Middle East.
If it's going to be done, it will be done by a government-sponsored
effort. Taking him out is the only viable option.''
   He said any attempt would likely come from elite U.S. forces
working with the Kuwaiti resistance in an advisory capacity.
   John Coleman of Boulder said he believes the United States could
carry out a ``hit'' on Saddam.
   ``Our government and allied governments have remarkable assets
available to them,'' Coleman said. ``We are capable of doing a hit,
absolutely.''
   Tim Dawdy of Troutdale, Ore. called Saddam ``another two-bit
tinhorn'' who will ``take care of himself in time.''
   ``If the U.S. thinks he is a liability, if he is going to be
eliminated, I think we should have someone walk up and shoot him.
...''
   Brown said the U.S. had taken the stance that it would not
initiate a conflict with Iraq.
   ``I'm not sure we're going to have that luxury,'' he said.

   It's criminal what they've done to
Mecklenburg's new courthouse.
   Actually, it's ``crimminal.''
   Somebody goofed in putting up the sign for the main entrance of
the new $12.5 million courthouse. The sign says: Crimminal Courts
Building.
   News of the misspelling drew chuckles from courthouse personnel,
lawyers and judges.
   ``That's terrible. I can't believe it,'' Mecklenburg Trial Court
Administrator Tom Cameron said Wednesday.
   It's not the only misspelling on signs around the courthouse.
   Posted outside a metal security gate along 3rd Street is this
warning: ``Unauthorized persons in this area will be subject to
arrest and prosecution for tresspassing.''
   There's no such crime. It's trespassing.
   Jim Bookout, Mecklenburg's director of buildings and grounds,
said the signs are temporary and will be replaced with permanent
ones when all work on the courthouse is finished in a few months.
   Jack Brown, vice president and general manager for SignArt of
Charlotte, the company putting up the signs, said the misspellings
will be fixed for free. ``It's just something that got by,'' Brown
said.

   Authorities have ordered rationing of
cheese in the Bulgarian capital, which has been increasingly
affected by severe consumer shortages, newspapers said Thursday.
   Reports said Sofia residents will be limited to purchases of 1
pound of white cheese per month starting Friday and three-quarters
of a pound of yellow cheese monthly beginning Oct. 1.
   Duma, the newspaper of the ruling Socialist Party, said
residents of the nearby industrial city of Pernik were being
limited to a half-pound of yellow cheese and a quarter-pound of
butter.
   Another newspaper, Svoboden Narod, quoted spokeswoman Temenuzhka
Petrova of the Sofia City Council as saying meat rationing was
unlikely the next two months.
   Food prices are increasing rapidly, and Bulgarian industry is
processing less food.
   The official BTA news agency reported Wednesday that the Council
of Ministers was considering emergency legislation to crack down on
black marketeers, corruption and smuggling.
   Last week, government officials were quoted as saying that
electricity will be rationed both to homes and industry this
winter. Electrical energy to industry will be cut by an estimated
10-20 percent.
   Bulgaria's economic situation has worsened steadily in recent
months as the Socialists have struggled to form a new government.
   The Socialists won multiparty elections in June, but their
popularity has fallen steadily as in many areas key food and
consumer items have disappeared from shops. Duma said this month
that the country could face famine.

   Here is the opening statement by Supreme Court
nominee David Souter before the Senate Judiciary Committee on
Thursday:
   OK. Mr. Chairman, Sen. Thurmond and other members of the
committee. As you know, I did not ask to make a formal and
pre-prepared statement, but I would like to accept your invitation
to say a few words before our dialogue together does begin.
   And I would like to start maybe in a very obvious way, simply by
saying thanks for some things. To begin with - to thank every
member of this committee, who in the - the waning and the very
hectic days that you went through prior to the summer recess,
nonetheless found some time to see me when I came by to meet you,
in most cases for the first time. And I was grateful for the
reception and the courtesy that everyone of you gave to me.
   Equally obviously, I would like simply to say here what I've
already said privately this morning, or at least quietly this
morning, in thanking both Sen. Humphrey and Sen. Rudman for their
generosity to me in their introduction and their sponsorship of me
before you.
   And I will have to continue, as I have been trying to do for the
past seven or eight weeks now, to say some adequate thanks to the
president of the United States for the confidence that he showed in
me in making that nomination. I have not succeeded in doing that
adequately yet, but I will keep trying.
   In fact, I came to the notice of probably most of you on this
committee when I stood next to the president and tried, again with
great difficulty, that afternoon in late July, to express some
sense of the honor that I felt, despite the - despite the surprise,
and even shock, of the event to me.
   It's equally - it's equally incumbent on me to try to express
some sense of the honor that I feel today, in appearing before you,
as you represent the Senate of the United States, in discharging
your own responsibility, to review the president's nomination. I
could only - I could only adopt what Sen. Metzenbaum said earlier
this morning about the - the grandeur of this process of which we
are a part.
   I mentioned to you the great surprise that I had on July 23 in
finding myself where I was. I certainly found very quickly that I
had no reason to be surprised at the interest which the United
States and the - actually a good deal of the world suddenly took in
me as an individual.
   And despite the reams of paper and, I suppose, the forests that
have fallen to produce that paper, in the time between July 23, I
would like to take a minute, before we begin our - our dialogue
together, to say something to you about how I feel about the
beginnings that I have come from and about the experiences that I
have had, that bear on the kind of judge that I am, and the kind of
judge that I can be expected to be.
   I think you know that I spent most of my - my boyhood in a small
town in New Hampshire, Weare, N.H. It was a - it was a town large
in geography, small in population. The physical space, the open
space between people, however, was not matched by the - by the
inner space between them, because as everybody knows who has lived
in a small town, there is - there is a closeness of people in a
small town which is unattainable anywhere else.
   There was in that town no section or place or neighborhood that
was determined by anybody's occupation or by anybody's bank
balance.
   Everybody knew everybody else's business, or at least thought
they did, and we were in a very true sense intimately aware of
other lives. We were aware of lives that were easy and we were
aware of lives that were very hard.
   Another thing that we were aware of in that place was the
responsibility of people to govern themselves. It was a
responsibility that they owed to themselves, and it was a
responsibility that they owed and owe to their neighbors. I first
learned about that or I first learned the practicalities of that
when I used to go over to the Town Hall in Weare, N.H., on town
meeting day and I would sit on the benches in the back of the Town
Hall after school, and that's where I began my lessons in practical
government.
   As I think you know, I went to high school in Concord, N.H.,
which is a bigger place, and I went on from there to college and to
study law in Cambridge, Mass., and Oxford, England, which are
bigger places still. And after I had finished law school I came
back to New Hampshire and I began the practice of law and I think
probably it's fair to say I resumed the study of practical
government.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter firmly
refused to discuss his views on abortion Thursday as the Senate
Judiciary Committee opened confirmation hearings. Democrats
promised to continue pressing him on that and other controversial
issues.
   Souter told senators it would be inappropriate for him to
discuss such a hotly contested constitutional matter as abortion,
though he said he accepted the constitutional right of privacy on
which the Supreme Court based its abortion-legalizing 1973
decision, Roe vs. Wade.
   The New Hampshire judge, nominated by President Bush to be the
court's 105th justice, spoke slowly and somberly in the crowded
Senate hearing room of the position he called ``the greatest
responsibility that any judge in our republic can undertake.''
   The court has been deeply divided in recent years with 5-4
rulings on such contentious issues such as abortion and civil
rights, and conservatives are hoping that Souter will help anchor
the court firmly on the right.
   ``If the Senate of the United States believes it is right to
confirm my nomination, then I will accept those responsibilities as
obligations to all of the people of the United States whose lives
will be affected by my stewardship of the Constitution,'' Souter
said.
   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., then began the long
process in which Souter would confront questions from all 14
committee members.
   Biden engaged Souter in a dialogue about the right of privacy,
which although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution has
been recognized by the Supreme Court since a 1965 decision called
Griswold vs. Connecticut.
   At one point, Souter talked about a need for the Supreme Court
to follow its own precedents - stating that past decisions should
be overturned only after careful consideration.
   ``The first question is whether the prior decision was wrong,''
he said. And if the court does determine its previous ruling was
incorrect, he added, it should measure ``the degree and kind of
reliance placed upon'' the ruling and the ``cost of overruling''
it.
   Souter began his testimony after sitting quietly for two hours
while senators made opening statements.
   He proved an attentive and respectful witness, though hardly
devoid of humor.
   When one senator, worried about his questioning time expiring,
cut Souter's response to a question short, the nominee quipped,
``You're going to turn me into a laconic Yankee if you keep doing
that.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., questioned the nominee closely
about positions he took while New Hampshire's attorney general and,
before that, as an assistant in the attorney general's office.
   Kennedy focused on cases in which the state defended a literacy
test for prospective voters and resisted federal regulations
seeking information about hiring in state government.
   In both instances, Souter emphasized, he was ``acting as an
advocate'' and ``representing a client.'' He said both positions
were tenable at the time, in the 1970s.
   Earlier, Souter said he would view his Supreme Court service as
a responsibility ``to make the promises of the Constitution a
reality for our time and to preserve that Constitution for the
generations that will follow us.''
   Drawing battle lines quickly, Democrats advised him to ``open
for us the window into your mind'' while Republicans told him to
keep his own counsel in facing sensitive questions.
   ``The burden of proof is on you,'' Biden told him. ``We have a
right to know, and a duty to discover, precisely what you ... think
about the great constitutional issues of our time.''
   He urged Souter, ``Open for us the window into your mind. And
give us a little bit of a glimpse into your heart.''
   Biden and the committee's two other leading liberals, Kennedy
and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, asked Souter to discuss candidly his
views of key issues on which the Supreme Court is closely divided.
   But Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the committee's
ranking Republican, said his colleagues had no right ``to question
a nominee about how he or she would decide a particular case. It is
inappropriate.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., added, ``Overly explicit questions
are not only unwise but, I believe, impermissible.''
   Reminding Souter that federal judges are ethically bound not to
publicly discuss matters that are, or may be, before any court,
Simpson gave the judge some Western advice: ``Sit deep in the
saddle.''
   Kennedy said little in Souter's record as a state judge and
attorney general in New Hampshire ``demonstrates real solicitude
for the rights of those who are weakest and most powerless in our
society.''
   ``It is the responsibility of this committee to find out whether
Judge Souter is committed to these rights and other basic values
enshrined in the Constitution,'' Kennedy said. ``That is why these
hearings ... are so important.''
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, urged the nominee to ``stand your
ground when you sincerely believe you are being asked for answers
you clearly cannot properly provide.''
   The hearing's opening session was interrupted briefly when 12
people - six men and six women - stood and shouted in protest. ``He
will kill women,'' shouted one.
   The demonstrators, who said they were members of a gay rights
group, were hustled from the cavernous hearing room by police. They
were arrested and charged with disrupting a congressional hearing.
   ``Welcome to Washington, judge,'' Biden told Souter after the
outburst.
   Souter, 50, was nominated by President Bush on July 23, three
days after Justice William J. Brennan retired from the nation's
highest court.
   Although he wrote more than 200 opinions in his seven years on
the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Souter has had few, if any,
occasions to write about such divisive issues as abortion, civil
rights and church-state relations.
   Souter, who spent more than a week last month paying courtesy
calls to the senators who will decide his nomination's fate, was
formally introduced to the committee by Republican New Hampshire
Sens. Gordon Humphrey and Warren Rudman.
   Both defended his ascetic lifestyle.
   ``The elegant pundits here inside the beltway think David Souter
may not be quite up to the big time because he drives a clunky old
car, because he believes in conserving energy by not mowing his
lawn until it begins to block his view when he looks out his
window,'' Humphrey said as Souter smiled.
   ``I believe you'll find David Souter to be as smart as anyone in
this city.''

   Shaalan I became an ugly memory
Thursday, a ghost town of tattered, dust-coated tents abandoned by
tens of thousands of Asian refugees.
   Caravans of crowded buses, their roofs piled high with the last
possessions of shattered lives, evacuated the remaining residents
of Jordan's most crowded and squalid refugee camp.
   ``We don't know where we are going. Some say we are going
directly to the airport. Others say we are going to a new camp.
Right now we don't care,'' said M.K. Aboobacker, a young Indian
electrician who came to Jordan when he could no longer find work in
occupied Kuwait.
   Shaalan I had become a symbol of hopelessness for the hordes who
fled Kuwait after it was invaded by Iraq on Aug. 2. It was the
first of three camps built along the Iraqi border and once housed
as many as 50,000 people.
   ``Attention Red Cross: Show us humanity. Save us from this
deadly desert,'' read one sign that Indian refugees attached to a
light pole at Shaalan I.
   ``At the begining we barely managed to provide enough drinking
water for everyone,'' said Laurent Schopfer, an official with the
International Committee of the Red Cross at Shaalan I. ``It was
like a riot when the water trucks arrived.''
   Jordanian officials said 13,000 refugees left the country
Thursday and that 13,000 more arrived.
   Salameh Hammad, general secretary of Jordan's Interior Ministry,
said about 40,000 refugees remained in Jordan and more than 360,000
others were in Iraq waiting to cross into the country.
   He said 589,000 foreigners, mostly Egyptians, had crossed Jordan
on their way home since the gulf crisis began. U.N. officials
estimate there could still be 2 million foreigners in Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Hammad said his country has spent $30 million on the crisis and
appealed to the world for more aid.
   Some of Shaalan I's last residents were taken to Amman's airport
for flights home. Caravans of buses took the others 120 miles west,
across the ancient lava fields of Jordan's eastern desert, to Azraq
I, a new camp with running water and hundreds of large tents set in
neat rows on a rocky plain.
   Red Cross official Roland Sidler said the camp, 50 miles west of
Amman, can house 15,000 refugees but is being expanded to hold
25,000.
   Azraq II, another new but smaller camp, was being set up 1{
miles west.
   ``When we don't have room at Azraq I and II, we will transfer
people to Shaalan II and Mercy camp,'' said Hammad, referring to
two smaller, better-equipped border camps.
   At Azraq I Thursday, a handful of half-dressed Indians showered
or washed their clothes under faucets while about 50 evacuees from
Shaalan I argued heatedly with Jordanian officials who had taken
their passports.
   ``They told us we were going straight to the airport but we came
here instead and then they took our passports,'' said Surrya
Raddimalla, 37.
   Iqbal Singh, 50, told reporters conditions were better, that
there was water and food. But he also showed his Air India
return-trip ticket to Bombay and demanded to know why he must live
in any camp.
   ``I have a Jordanian visa in my passport. Why must I suffer? Why
won't they let me in?'' Singh asked.
   Back at Shaalan I, Schopfer marveled at the speed with which he
said governments and relief organizations were moving to repatriate
the refugees. Officials once feared massive starvation would
overtake relief efforts.
   ``It only took about four days to move everyone out of this
camp,'' he said. As he talked he strolled past piles of rotting
garbage in the litter-strewn camp, swatted at swarms of flies and
peered inside the filthy, abandoned tents.
   ``It is really the first time we have seen how these people had
to live,'' he said, nodding toward the bedding, tins of food and
cooking utensils left behind.
   ``Maybe they will take a bulldozer to it and bury this ugly
memory,'' he said.

<HEAD>West Germany Says it Plans More Aid in Gulf Showdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday
that West Germany will lend ``a helping hand'' to the United States
in the gulf showdown, but he did not say whether that included
money.
   In Brussels, Belgium, an official of the European Economic
Community said the foreign ministers of the 12 member nations will
consider a proposal on Monday to provide $1.95 billion in aid to
Jordan, Turkey and Egypt. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The EC foreign ministers agreed in principle to aid for Jordan,
Turkey and Egypt last week, but no amount was disclosed. The
countries have lost trade because of the U.N. embargo against Iraq
and Kuwait.
   In Washington, Congress has been scathingly critical of Japan
and West Germany for allegedly failing to shoulder their load in
the U.S.-led military buildup following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   Kohl said he will discuss ways his country could assist in the
Middle East when he meets Saturday with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Germany would ``like to extend a helping hand to our friends in
the United States in this very critical situation in the Middle
East,'' he said.
   He made the comments in a welcoming address for visiting former
President Reagan.
   ``When Jim Baker pays us a visit on Saturday, I am going to
discuss with him what we can do to help. ... Let me remind all of
us that what the United States is doing there is of benefit to
us,'' Kohl said.
   The West German leader said he did not want his country to be
perceived as one that benefits from its powerful exports but was
not willing to help out in times of crisis.
   ``This is not my policy,'' Kohl said.
   Earlier, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told a news
conference that Baker would be very satisfied with his trip to
Bonn.
   ``We will lay out what we want to do and in part what we are
already doing,'' Genscher said.
   But he declined to specify how West Germany would show its
solidarity with the international effort to reverse the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   West Germany so far has sent five minesweepers and two supply
ships to the eastern Mediterranean to support the U.S. fleet. Bonn
also has provided humanitarian aid for the tens of thousands of
refugees stranded in Jordan.
   The West German government says its constitution prevents it
from sending troops outside the NATO area. Kohl has said he would
seek changes to allow German forces to take part in U.N.
activities.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ... practical government.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I went to work for a law firm in Concord, N.H., and I practiced
there for several years. I then became, as I think you know, an
Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of that office.
I was then lucky to be Deputy Attorney General to Warren Rudman and
I succeeded him as Attorney General in 1976.
   The experience of government, though, did not wait until the day
came that I entered public, as opposed to private, law practice,
because although in those years of private practice I served the
private clients of the firm, I also did something in those days
which was very common then, perhaps it is less common today, I know
it is, but it was an accepted part of private practice in those
days and that was to take on a fair share of representation of
clients who did not have the money to pay.
   I remember very well that the first day that I ever spent by
myself in a courtroom, I spent in a courtroom representing a woman
whose personal life had become such a shambles that she had lost
the custody of her children and she was trying to get them back.
She was not the last of such clients. I represented clients with
domestic relations problems who lived sometimes, it seemed to me,
in appalling circumstances.
   I can remember representing a client who was trying to pull a
life together after being evicted because she couldn't pay the
rent. And although cases like that were not the - those were not
the cases upon which the firm paid the rent, those were not
remarkable cases for lawyers in private practice in those days
before governmentally funded legal services. And they were the
cases that we took at that time because taking them was the only
way to make good on the supposedly open door of our courts to the
people who needed to get inside and to get what courts had to offer
through the justice system. And I think it is fair to say that even
- I am glad it is fair to say that even today, with so much
governmentally funded legal service, there are lawyers in private
practice in our profession who are doing the same thing.
   As you know, I did go on to public legal service. And in the
course of doing that, I met not only legislators and the
administrators that one finds in a government, but I began to
become familiar with the criminal justice system in my state and in
our nation. I met victims, and sometimes I met the survivors of
victims; I met defendants, and I met that train of witnesses from
the clergy to con artists who pass through our system and find
themselves, either willingly or unwillingly, part of a search for
truth and part of a search for those results that we try to sum up
with the words of justice.
   As you also know, after those years, I became a trial judge, and
my experience with the working of government in the judicial system
broadened there, because I was a trial judge of general
jurisdiction, and I saw every sort and condition of the people of
my state that a trial court of general jurisdiction is exposed to.
I saw litigants in international commercial litigation for
millions, and I saw children who were the unwitting victims of
domestic disputes and custody fights which somehow seemed to -
somehow seemed to defy any reasonable solution, however hard we
worked at it. I saw, once again, the denizens of the criminal
justice system, and I saw domestic litigants. I saw appellants from
the juvenile justice system who were appealing their findings of
delinquency.
   And in fact, I had maybe the - one of the great experiences of
my entire life in seeing week in and week out the members of the
trial juries of our states who are rightly called the ``consciences
of our communities,'' and I worked with them and I learned from
them, and I will never forget my days with them.
   And when those days on the trial court were over, there were two
experiences that I took away with me, or two lessons that I had
learned, and the lessons remain with me today.
   The first lesson, simple as it is, is that whatever court we are
in, whatever we are doing, whether we are on a trial court or an
appellate court, at the end of our task some human being is going
to be affected. Some human life is going to be changed in some way
by what we do, whether we do it as trial judges or whether we do it
as appellate judges as far removed from the trial arena as it is
possible to be.
   The second lesson that I learned in that time is that if indeed
we are going to be trial judges whose rulings will affect the lives
of other people, and who are going to change their lives by what we
do, we had better use every power of our minds and our hearts and
our beings to get those rulings right.
   And I am conscious of those two lessons, as I have been for all
of the years that I was on an appellate court. I am conscious of
them as I sit here today, suddenly finding myself the nominee of
the president of the United States to undertake the greatest
responsibility that any judge in our republic can undertake, the
responsibility to join with eight other people to make the promises
of the Constitution a reality for our time and to preserve that
Constitution for the generations that will follow us after we are
gone from here.
   And I am mindful of those two lessons when I tell you this: that
if you believe, and the Senate of the United States believes, that
it is right to confirm my nomination, then I will accept those
responsibilities as obligations to all of the people in the United
States whose lives will be affected by my stewardship of the
Constitution.
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<HEAD>Cheney: More Overseas Bases Will Be Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon will close ``well over 100''
military facilities overseas over the next few years, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday.
   Cheney gave no specifics about the type of facilities he was
referring to, but he said the bulk of the cutbacks would be in
Western Europe.
   The secretary made the remark at a question-and-answer session
following a speech before the Air Force Association and the
Comstock Club in Sacramento, Calif.
   Queried why the administration had begun cutting back on
domestic bases instead of sites in Korea, the Philippines or Japan,
Cheney replied:
   ``Within the next couple of weeks, I will announce well over 100
facilities overseas where U.S. forces are now deployed that will,
in fact, be closed over the next couple of years.''
   The secretary said that ``most of those'' would involve sites in
Western Europe.
   The closings will be in line with expected reductions in U.S.
forces in Europe, given prospects for an agreement with the Soviet
Union on reducing conventional forces, Cheney said.
   ``So the idea that we're only closing bases at home simply isn't
a valid one, because ... there will be significant ones (closures)
overseas,'' the secretary said.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Glenn Flood, said in Washington that
Cheney was using the word ``facilities'' rather than bases. That
could mean that Cheney would propose closing several facilities
within a particular base, such as a school, hospital or other type
of unit, the spokesman said.
   In January, Cheney recommended closing or scaling back 72
domestic bases and 14 overseas facilities.
   The Pentagon doesn't need congressional approval to close
overseas facilities.
   Cheney defended domestic base closings as a necessary part of
the long-term reduction in defense spending.
   ``It is not a pleasant task to be the one who has to preside
over that,'' Cheney said. But the secretary said that there is ``no
question'' such cuts are coming given the nations' budget woes.
   ``The only way I know to cut the defense budget is to seriously
go about the business of trying to downsize the force, to cut force
structure, to cut procurement, and to cut the infrastructure - the
base structure - that goes with it,'' Cheney said.
   ``If I do what many in Congress want me to do, which is to
protect and preserve all the bases, keep all the jobs open on all
the assembly lines and all the defense jobs in America, the thing
that ends up getting cut is our forces - such as the units we just
sent to Saudi Arabia,'' he said.

   An Israeli army unit battled Shiite
Moslem guerrillas and leftist militiamen Thursday near a village
believed used as a base to attack Israel's self-declared security
zone, police reported.
   A statement by the Lebanese National Resistance Front indicated
at least 12 Israeli soldiers were either killed or wounded in the
clash around the village of Kawkaba in the Bekaa Valley, about two
miles north of the security zone.
   There were no other reports or confirmations of casualties.
   The estimated 50-member Israeli unit withdrew from the area
after shelling troops from the resistance front, a leftist militia,
and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, said a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Seven Israeli armored personnel carriers advanced into Kawkaba
``behind a curtain of howitzer fire at first light,'' said the
police spokesman.
   Israeli howitzer batteries in the security zone also shelled the
Hezbollah-controlled villages of Ein al-Tineh and Maidoun near
Kawkaba. The police spokesman said the shelling seemed to be an
attempt to block Hezbollah supply lines.
   He said Hezbollah counterattacked in the ``fierce battle'' with
Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets.
   He said Syrian troops deployed nearby were not involved.
   Kawkaba, a deserted village, is believed to be used by Hezbollah
fighters to launch attacks against Israeli troops and allied
militiamen in the security zone.
   Israel established the six- to 10-mile-wide zone in 1985 after
the withdrawal of its troops who invaded Lebanon three years
earlier. It is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli soldiers and 3,000
allied troops of the mostly Christian South Lebanon Army.

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) - A magistrate ordered a delay
Thursday in the start of a hearing for Yasin Abu Bakr and 112 other
Moslem militants who captured the prime minister during a coup
attempt.
   Chief Magistrate Melville Baird granted a prosecution request
for an adjournment to allow more time to prepare its case. The
magistrate set Sept. 25 as the new date for the preliminary
hearing.
   Bakr, 48, a former policeman, and the members of his Jamaat
al-Muslimeen (Society of Moslems) face the death penalty for
charges that include murder and treason.
   About two dozen female Jamaat supporters shouted ``Allah
akbar!'' (God is great) as Bakr and 18 other prisoners filed into
the courtroom, where they were kept in a specially built iron cage
for the 45-minute proceedings.
   For security reasons, the remaining prisoners are to appear
later in four separate groups.
   Heavily armed soldiers in camouflage uniforms ringed the
converted gym in the western town of Chaguaramas, 10 miles outside
Port-of-Spain, for the Moslems' first court appearance since the
six-day coup attempt ended Aug. 1.
   Wearing a white tunic and black fez, the Moslem leader bowed to
reporters and said: ``Morning to the press. Morning everybody.''
   Spectators were searched and scanned with metal detectors before
entering the courtroom. An armored tank was positioned outside.
   Prosecutor Theodore Guerra said the newly appointed head of the
prosecution team, Karl Hudson-Phillips, needed more time to prepare
his case. Defense attorney Nathaniel King had no objection.
   Bakr and his followers captured the Parliament and state-run
television station and seized Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson
and more than 50 others, including several Cabinet members.
   The attack and subsequent looting left 24 dead. Robinson, 63,
was shot in the left leg. Bakr and his men are charged in
connection with eight deaths.
   Bakr had blamed Robinson's administration for widespread poverty
in this once oil-wealthy Caribbean nation off Venezuela.
   Trinidad and its sister island of Tobago remain under a state of
emergency, giving police wide powers of search and arrest, and a
nighttime curfew.

<HEAD>Poll: Hartigan, Edgar Race Tightening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Neil Hartigan is catching up
to GOP rival Jim Edgar in the Illinois governor' race, but
Republican Lynn Martin is showing no gains in her bid to unseat
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, according to a statewide poll.
   In the telephone survey of 821 registered Illinois voters,
Secretary of State Edgar had 44 percent and Attorney General
Hartigan 40 percent, with 16 percent undecided.
   Simon had 51 percent and Martin 36 percent, with 13 percent
undecided.
   The survey was conducted last Friday through Tuesday for Copley
News Service by Political Media Research Inc. of Washington, D.C.
   It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points
above or below each candidate's totals.
   Edgar has lost two percentage points and Hartigan has gained two
points since a similar survey done in July by the same polling
organization. In that poll, Edgar was leading 46 percent to 38
percent.
   The latest poll had Simon holding on to a significant lead over
Martin, a five-term congresswoman. Simon is running for a second
six-year term.
   The latest results represent a slight loss for Martin, who
trailed Simon 51 percent to 39 percent in the earlier poll.

   The Boston Globe took the unusual step Thursday of
deciding not to endorse any contender for statewide office in next
Tuesday's primary election.
   In an editorial, the newspaper said that ``In 1990 ... the
resource of leadership is severely depleted.''
   The editorial noted that Massachusetts faces political and
economic perils and said that there has been ``politics-as-usual
bombast'' among the candidates.
   The Globe criticized Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierce
and his GOP opponent, William Weld, for taking ``irresponsible''
positions by supporting a November ballot question that would
sharply roll back state taxes and fees.
   On the Democratic side, the editorial said, ``John Silber seemed
on paper to be an ideal profile for voters yearning for a new
era.''
   ``Campaigns, however, are waged not on paper but on
personality,'' the Globe said. ``If voters were judging Silber on a
report card, his mark on `Works well with others' would not be
high.''

   Executions this week in Oklahoma and Illinois
may be signaling an era of more frequent use of the death penalty
in more states, legal experts say.
   With 124 other Illinois death row inmates and at least two
murderers in New Jersey and California nearing the end of their
appeals, capital punishment appears likely to become more common in
non-Southern states.
   ``We are stepping up to another plateau,'' said Henry
Schwarzschild, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Capital Punishment Project.
   ``We're now seeing the reality that the death penalty is no
longer a regional Southern phenomenon but a national one.''
   The South remains the heartland of the death penalty, according
to figures from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. All but 16 of 139
executions since the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for
resumption of the death penalty in 1976 took place in Southern
states.
   Thirty-six states have death penalty laws under which about 200
people are sentenced annually.
   Texas has had 37 executions, Florida 23, Louisiana 19, Georgia,
14, Virginia nine, Alabama eight, Mississippi four, North Carolina
and South Carolina three each, Arkansas two, and Oklahoma one.
   Outside the South, Nevada has executed five people since 1976,
Utah has executed three, Indiana has executed two and Missouri has
executed five, four of them this year.
   On Wednesday, Illinois became the northernmost state to carry
out the death penalty when it executed murderer Charles Walker by
injection, the first to die at the hands of that state in 28 years.
   Illinois became the 16th state to put someone to death since the
1976 high court ruling. On Monday, Oklahoma executed murderer
Charles T. Coleman by injection.
   In Wyoming, convicted murderer Mark Hopkinson faces death by
injection on Sept. 25. His latest appeal was rejected by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Perhaps the most closely-watched case at the moment is in
California, where murderer Robert Alton Harris came a step closer
to the gas chamber when his sentence was upheld last month by a
federal appeals court. No execution date has been set.
   And on Tuesday, New Jersey's Supreme Court heard arguments in
the case of multiple murderer Richard Biegenwald. The court
overturned his death sentence in 1987 on a technicality, but a new
jury broke new ground in the state by sentencing Biegenwald to
death again, triggering an automatic appeal.
   Nineteen murderers have been executed this year, compared with
16 in all of 1989 but still less than the post 1976-peak of 25 in
1987.
   Twenty-one of the 139 executed since 1976 went voluntarily,
including Walker in Illinois.
   But even for those fighting execution, many now believe that the
decade-long conservative drift in politics and court decisions
increases the likelihood of more frequent executions in more
states.
   Politicians including California Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Dianne Feinstein have recently been scoring points with
voters by stressing their pro-death penalty stance.
   Death penalty opponents who had held executioners at bay since
1976 have largely been rebuffed by the courts, said Schwarzschild.
   ``There are almost 2,400 on death row,'' he said. ``Many have
been there for a long time. Though the legal remedies are very time
consuming, they are not inexhaustible. Some are now reaching the
end of those remedies. And those legal remedies are being
progressively foreshortened.''
   The average time elapsed between sentencing and execution was 77
months between 1977 and 1988 for those who have actually been
executed, according to latest figures available from the federal
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   Some expect the average stay on death row to become shorter in
the years ahead.
   The U.S. Supreme Court two years ago took a crucial step in
breaking the appeals logjam. In McCleskie vs. Kempp, the justices
rejected arguments that the death penalty should be overturned
because it was geared largely to punish killers of white victims.
   According to NAACP Legal Defense Fund figures, 120, or 85.1
percent of the victims of those executed since 1976 were white.
   The McCleskie case, said Schwarzschild, ``was the last great
challenge to the general pattern and process by which the death
penalty was imposed. Now we have hand to hand legal combat, but
nothing that affects a great many people on death row.''
   But Karima Wicks, research director of NAACP Legal Defense's
capital punishment project, said the rush to the death chamber
might yet be slowed if Congress passes the so-called Racial Justice
Act, an amendment to the Omnibus Crime bill now pending before the
House of Representatives.
   The act, aimed at overturning the McCleskie ruling, would make
it unlawful to impose a death sentence because of the race of
either the victim or criminal. A defendant could appeal a sentence
by using evidence that showed a pattern of discriminatory
sentencing.

<HEAD>Administration Pushes Clean Air Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, concerned the oil
crisis might be used to thwart clean air legislation, said Thursday
the tougher pollution controls required by the bill could save as
much as 1 million barrels of oil a day.
   The report on the expected fuel savings, most of which would
come toward the end of the decade, was made public as some members
of Congress began questioning the wisdom of new and expensive
pollution controls at a time of increasing energy costs.
   House and Senate negotiators were continuing to try to resolve
differences in separate clean air bills, but a meeting was abruptly
canceled Thursday. Participants had hoped to give final approval to
a compromise reached last week on industrial controls to reduce
urban smog.
   The legislation, expected to cost the energy industry as much as
$25 billion a year by the end of the decade when all its
requirements go into effect, requires pollution controls on
electric power plants, factories and automobiles. It also requires
the sale of cleaner gasoline blends in areas with serious smog
problems.
   The study released Thursday by the Environmental Protection
Agency concluded that as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day may
be saved because tougher acid rain controls will prompt utilities
to switch from oil to natural gas.
   Another 500,000 barrels a day will be saved from requirement for
automobiles to burn cleaner fuels and from the increased use of
alternative fuel vehicles, the EPA said.
   ``The total of 800,000 to 1 million barrels a day exceeds the
total oil imports from Kuwait and Iraq,'' EPA Administrator William
Reilly told reporters.
   ``I think the energy implications ... make it more urgently
necessary than ever for Congress to pass the bill,'' he said in a
later telephone interview.
   Bush administration officials have acknowledged some concern in
recent weeks that progress on the clean air legislation might be
jeopardized amid the uproar over rising oil prices, the prospects
of an economic recession and the potential of oil shortages.
   Only days after the Middle East crisis erupted last month,
industry lobbyists began to question whether the time was right to
impose added financial costs to industry in the form of tougher
pollution controls.
   Some critics have argued that a number of provisions in the bill
would increase oil consumption. For example, the use of scrubbers
by utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide requires more energy, as does
the refining of certain cleaner gasoline blends, they said.
   But the EPA study said all that would be offset by more
significant energy gains.
   The study said that 300,000 to 500,000 barrels of oil could be
saved by utilities that will be persuaded to switch from using
sulfur-containing oil to using natural gas because of the bill's
acid rain control provisions.
   A requirement to use cleaner fuels and gasoline blends in cities
with serious smog problems and the increased use of alternative
fuel vehicles also would lead to the savings of another 500,000
barrels of oil daily, the study said.
   The legislation requires that gasoline blends, which likely
would be 15 percent or more of ethanol or methanol, would be
required in at least nine cities.
   Some of the cleaner fuel requirements would apply to as many as
40 cities.

   David Souter's mother didn't blame her son
for showing up at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings with a 5
o'clock shadow and a ragged look.
   ``He has a very heavy beard. He's meticulous about shaving, but
that he can't help,'' Helen Souter said. ``He looks exhausted,
after all he's been through.''
   The high court nominee lived with his mother in their
weatherbeaten farmhouse until she moved into a retirement residence
in nearby Concord several years ago. Until Souter went to
Washington to prepare for the hearings, he continued to live in
Weare and visit her every Sunday.
   Mrs. Souter, 82, recalled watching all of Robert Bork's
confirmation hearings live and expected similar coverage of her son
on Cable News Network, which isn't broadcasting all of the
hearings.
   ``I was just watching it and they turned it off,'' she said.
``I'm very much disappointed.''
   But Mrs. Souter is luckier than many of Souter's hometown fans.
Without cable in the town of 4,500 people, only those with
satellite dishes can watch CNN or C-SPAN.
   At John Stark Regional High School, teacher Tom Sutton said he
plans to show tapes of some of the hearings in his personal-law
class. He said Souter gives hometown flesh to the abstractions of
justice.
   ``Here's the highest court in the land, and we've got someone
who is maybe going to be there,'' he said. ``It's creating a lot of
local interest in the man, but it's creating interest in the
position as well.''
   One of Sutton's students, senior Joel Nazer, said Souter's rise
from Weare to Washington has inspired him.
   ``I'm from Henniker, and not a lot really comes out of Henniker
or Weare,'' Nazer said. ``You see a rare incident like this and you
really stop and think.''
   When Souter was growing up, he spent his summers swimming and
fishing with Janet Brown. She said she is still close to her friend
and watches his confirmation hearings with pride.
   ``We went to an elementary school where there were 11 or 12
children in class, in a town where fathers worked and mothers were
home,'' she said. ``Swimming, canning, getting wood - he's a real
country person. He's the basics; he's what we were all brought up
to believe in. He'll be as strong as our Constitution.''
   Brown said that during the opening of the hearings, the respect
with which the senators treated Souter impressed her.
   ``It's America at work. America can sleep better knowing someone
with his integrity has the opportunity to be there,'' she said.
   Each of Weare's selectmen has written to the members of the
Judiciary Committee urging them to confirm Souter's nomination. ``I
don't think he can do wrong in any way as far as the people in the
town are concerned,'' Selectman Bill Herman said.

   French President Francois
Mitterrand on Thursday called for a European community that would
eventually include the newly democratic countries of Eastern
Europe.
   Mitterrand spoke to deputies of the Czechoslovak parliament,
this country's first freely elected legislature in four decades, on
the first day of his two-day official visit to Czechoslovakia.
   ``Let us create a new European geography of culture and history.
... Let us get used to the idea of cooperation as soon as
possible,'' he told deputies in a 45-minute nationally televised
speech.
   Calling Czechoslovakia the ``spiritual crossroads of Europe,''
Mitterrand presented his vision of European integration based on
Western democracies gradually absorbing the emerging independent
countries of Eastern Europe.
   ``We could reach a continental agreement that could be a
beginning of a permanent dialogue,'' he said.
   He said his idea was close to that of Czechoslovak President
Vaclav Havel, who wants European integration to be built around the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   ``Prague could become the center for such talks, and I am going
to campaign for this idea,'' Mitterrand said, indirectly supporting
Prague's bid to become the headquarters of the 35-nation body.
   In other remarks, the French president cautioned that the
process of reforming Czechoslovakia's stagnant economy requires
patience.
   However, he praised the peaceful revolution of 1989 as ``the
greatest popular revolt since the French revolution in 1789.''
   Earlier in the day, Havel drew parallels between the German
invasion of Czechoslovakia 52 years ago and any appeasement of Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait.
   Havel's comments, at an official lunch for Mitterrand, played
heavily on comparisons of the Persian Gulf crisis and the Munich
Pact. Concluded Sept. 30, 1938, the pact secured French and British
acquiescence for Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   ``The shameful aggression against Kuwait and the ensuing crisis
in the Persian Gulf today make the old lesson from Munich topical
again,'' Havel said. ``The policy of appeasement cannot be
successful in the long run; on the contrary, it is malignant.''
   Czechoslovakia has joined in the U.N.-ordered embargo on Iraq,
despite estimates it could lose up to $1 billion in trade.
   Also Thursday, Foreign minister Jiri Dienstbier and his French
counterpart, Roland Dumas, signed agreements on cultural and
student exchanges and the setting up of cultural centers in both
countries.
   Finance ministers Vaclav Klaus and Jean-Marie Rausch of France
ratified a treaty on protection of French investments in
Czechoslovakia and repatriation of profit.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added
his voice Thursday to those warning of threats to the insurance
fund that protects bank deposits, but he cautioned Congress against
acting so hastily that it makes the problem worse.
   Members of Congress appeared inclined to ignore Greenspan's
go-slow advice because of alarm over two reports this week that
indicated the reserves of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. could
be wiped out by a further downturn in the economy or by one large
bank failure.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said he was introducing legislation that would remove the caps on
the premium amount the FDIC can charge banks for the deposit
insurance.
   The legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio,
the ranking Republican on the committee, was similar to a measure
proposed Wednesday by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald
Riegle, D-Mich.
   Riegle said the matter was of such urgency that it had to be
addressed before Congress adjourns next month.
   The Bush administration added its support to a move to give the
FDIC more flexibility in setting premiums, with Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady saying the agency should be given ``all the tools it
needs.''
   The FDIC charges banks 12 cents a year for every $100 the agency
insures.
   The FDIC board voted last month to boost that amount to 19.5
cents, the maximum allowed under current law. That increase will
cost the banking industry an estimated $1 billion next year.
   General Accounting Office and Congressional Budget Office
reports that raised the specter of a savings-and-loan-type debacle
unless something is done to shore up the bank fund focused
attention on the problem.
   The depletion of a separate fund that insured deposits at S&amp;Ls
forced a bailout expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of
dollars over 30 years.
   Lawmakers, eager to avoid a repeat of the fiasco, said Congress
had to act without delay to rescue the FDIC, which has $13.2
billion in reserves.
   ``The revelation that with a few downward twitters of the
economy, the once mighty federal deposit insurance fund could go
broke shows the seriousness of the situation,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
   In testimony before the House Banking Committee, Greenspan noted
that FDIC reserves were at their lowest level in history at a time
when there were ``all too many problems'' still facing the banking
system from sagging loan portfolios, especially in the real estate
area.
   ``It thus seems clear that the insurance fund likely will remain
under stress for some time to come,'' Greenspan said. ``Moreover,
pressures would intensify if real estate market conditions were to
weaken further or a recession were to develop in the general
economy.''
   The Congressional Budget Office reported Wednesday that even
without a recession some 600 to 700 commercial banks likely will
fail over the next 3{ years, draining $20 billion from the FDIC
fund.
   But Greenspan cautioned that while ``reform is needed, so is
caution.''
   He spoke against proposals to reduce the insurance limit from
$100,000 per account and said it would be difficult, but not
impossible, to administer a law that limited the number of insured
accounts each individual could own.
   He also said lawmakers shouldn't boost premiums too much because
that could make the banking industry uncompetitive and increase the
number of bank failures, exactly the opposite effect intended.
   While saying he didn't oppose an increase in the insurance
premiums, Greenspan said such legislation should be adopted along
with proposals to restructure the banking system to give banks more
powers, such as the ability to underwrite the sale of securities.
   Greenspan has long championed efforts to repeal the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and
investment banking activities, saying the restrictions made it
difficult for banks to compete in a rapidly changing financial
world.
   Greenspan's appearance marked his first congressional testimony
since the Persian Gulf crisis boosted oil prices and added to fears
of an impending recession in the United States.
   However, his only comment on possible Fed monetary responses
came when he said that a credible, multiyear deal between the
administration and Congress to cut the budget deficit would lead to
lower interest rates.
   Repeating earlier comments, Greenspan said financial markets
would respond favorably in the belief that reduced federal
government borrowing would allow long-term interest rates to
decline. He said the central bank would do its part by helping to
push short-term interest rates lower.

<HEAD>FAA Won't Discuss New Detection Device</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Thursday it won't make any further comments about the only airport
device that can detect plastic explosives.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey said critics of the device have
had an adverse effect on the campaign to combat aviation terrorism.
   ``I felt they were damaging the deterrent capability of this
device,'' he said. ``The details of its performance are now
classified and aren't going to be discussed any more.''
   Four of the sophisticated Thermal Neutron Analysis, or TNA,
machines are being used to inspect baggage at international
airports here and in Europe and two others are ready for
installation.
   The performance of the TNA technology has long been the subject
of debate, with critics pointing to what they say is a high rate of
false alarms. Critics also note that the device failed to detect a
bomb as small as the one said to have destroyed Pan Am flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
   The presidential commission created to investigate the Pan Am
bombing called for a halt to the FAA's plans to buy 150 TNA devices
and install them at high-risk airports around the world.
   The commission said the government had made too heavy an
investment in TNA devices at the expense of other developing
technology that might prove more effective.
   Busey said the public discussion of the amount of explosives the
machine can detect and its false alarm rate have had a decidedly
negative impact.
   ``I disagree with them,'' Busey said of commission members who
reported their concern about the TNA technology to President Bush
in May.
   ``It is the only technology that can detect plastic
explosives,'' he said. ``It does work.''
   Busey also said the FAA knows how to put it into a system
``where we can work with and around its known capabilities and
limitations.''
   ``And in order to protect the enhancements, ... we are
classifying it so that it won't become common knowledge and
therefore limit its capabilities in a deterrent system,'' he said.
   TNA machines are used at Kennedy International Airport in New
York, Dulles International Airport outside Washington, in Miami and
at Gatwick airport south of London.
   Negotiations are under way to install a TNA detection device at
Frankfurt, West Germany. Busey said a decision will be made by the
end of the year on where the sixth TNA detector should be
installed.

   A day after the Postal Service offered to
deliver mail free from American military personnel in the Middle
East, the Pentagon said no.
   Military post offices collect the mail and then turn it over to
postal officials for delivery in this country.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank had said Wednesday that his
agency was prepared to accept and deliver mail, without stamps,
from personnel serving in Operation Desert Shield.
   But, on Thursday, the Defense Department said letters without
stamps cannot be accepted until Congress and President Bush approve
the action. The plan has passed the Senate and is pending in the
House.
   The House had appeared poised to approve the plan overwhelmingly
until Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., offered an amendment stipulating
that money to pay for the free mail would come from appropriations
for free franked mail by members of Congress.
   Ridge's proposal was rejected on a voice vote. He then demanded
a roll call vote, and because the House had already agreed to hold
no more recorded votes this week, the members postponed action
until next week.
   Pentagon spokesman Glen Flood said ``current law does not
authorize free mail for deployed forces in situations short of
hostilities. We hope the full Congress takes action soon, but as of
right now free mail is not authorized. We hope that changes.''
   Advised of the Pentagon decision, the Postal Service said that
its announcement of free mail from troops in Saudi Arabia ``was
made in the spirit and intent of proposed legislation.''
   ``The Postal Service stands ready to accept and deliver service
men and women's free mail when received,'' the agency said.

<HEAD>Florida Court Says Feeding Tubes Can Be Removed</HEAD>

   The Florida Supreme Court ruled
Thursday that relatives or guardians can order the removal of
feeding tubes that keep brain-damaged people alive, even if the
patients haven't signed ``living wills.''
   The justices added that the guardians don't need a court's
approval in each individual case. However, the patient must have
expressed, at least verbally, a preference for dying rather than
being kept alive with feeding tubes.
   Advocates of the ``right to die'' hailed the ruling, which does
not apply outside Florida. Opponents did not immediately respond,
saying they needed more time to review it.
   Roman Catholics and anti-abortion groups have been among those
fighting laws that allow forced feeding to be withdrawn.
   The foundation of the right-to-die decision, which came in the
case of an 89-year-old woman who died last summer, is the right to
privacy in Florida's state constitution.
   ``This case resolves a question of an individual's
constitutional right of self-determination,'' Justice Rosemary
Barkett wrote in the majority opinion.
   The woman at the center of the case, Estelle Browning, spent the
last 2{ years of her life hooked up to feeding tubes that she had
earlier, in a ``living will,'' specifically said she didn't want.
   She suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and was left in
a persistent vegetative state, unable to swallow or communicate.
She was not comatose. Doris Herbert, Mrs. Browning's second cousin
and only living relative, was named her guardian.
   Herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988. The state
fought the request and a trial court denied it. But a state appeals
court said the state's consititution allowed it, and the issue was
reviewed by the Supreme Court.
   ``We hold that, because Mrs. Browning was unable to exercise her
constitutional right of privacy by reason of her medical condition,
her guardian was authorized to exercise it for her,'' Barkett
wrote.
   Herbert's attorney, George Felos, said he was ``highly pleased''
by the ruling.
   He said he had expected the justices to rule that guardians
could order the removal of feeding tubes. However, he said he had
worried that the court would establish a judicial review process
that ``would have in essence defeated the right.''
   Barkett wrote that the court was ``loath to impose a cumbersome
legal proceeding at such a delicate time in those many cases where
the patient neither needs nor desires additional protection.''
   C. Marie King, the assistant state attorney who presented the
state's case to the court, did not return a phone call Thursday.
   The high court heard arguments in the case in January. Six
months later, the U.S. Supreme Court said a Missouri couple could
not order the removal of food and water that was keeping their
32-year-old comatose daughter alive.
   The daughter, Nancy Cruzan, had not left a living will, although
her parents said they were certain she would prefer to die rather
than live in a coma. In its split decision, the nation's high court
did say that competent people have a right to refuse medical
treatment.
   The Florida court, which cited that case, went on to say that it
has found previously that incompetent people have the same right,
through guardians acting on statements made before becoming
incompetent, to refuse medical treatment as competent people.
   The Browning case extended that ruling to people in Florida who
are not totally comatose but still cannot make their own decisions.
   Patricia Dore, a law professor at Florida State University who
drafted the Florida privacy clause, said it was significant that
the justices ruled there was no legal distinction between food and
water supplied through invasive tubes and other medical treatments,
such as respirators.
   Attorneys and advocates said other state courts could be
influenced by the case.
   ``I think many, many state courts look to Florida for guidance
on issues that affect the elderly,'' Felos said.
   Robert Miller, who represented the national Society for the
Right to Die in a friend-of-the-court brief, said the ruling was a
``real contribution in this area.''
   ``It's a really strong decision supporting the right of an adult
to control their own medical decisions,'' Miller said.
   Rosemary Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the Florida Catholic
Conference, said she hadn't seen the court's ruling and couldn't
comment on it. The Catholic Conference had submitted a
friend-of-the-court brief that opposed the removal of forced
feeding.

   The United States and the Soviet Union are giving
up on setting limits on their troops in Europe in a treaty they're
negotiating to reduce tanks and other non-nuclear weapons, a senior
U.S. official said Thursday night.
   But that still leaves a dispute over limits on airplanes, the
official said after Secretary of State James A. Baker III met for
two hours with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and then for
more than an hour with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We didn't make any headway on that,'' the official told
reporters as he flew to Damascus, Syria, for talks Friday with
President Hafez Assad.
   The outlook for completing the treaty by the end of the year - a
goal set by President Bush and Gorbachev - remains unclear.
   The two sides have set completion of the treaty as a
precondition for holding a 35-nation summit conference on reducing
tensions in Europe.
   Baker and Shevardnadze concluded that proposed limits on U.S.
and Soviet troops had become obsolete. The Soviets have agreed with
West Germany to withdraw the 350,000 soldiers they have in East
Germany over four years as part of German unification.
   Also, Soviet troops are being pulled out of Eastern Europe,
while U.S. forces in Western Europe also are being scaled back.
   The senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Shevardnadze had taken the troops issue off the table when
they met in Siberia last month and that Baker agrees the proposed
ceilings were overtaken by events.
   The ceilings would have permitted the Soviets and Americans up
to 195,000 soldiers in Central Europe, with another 30,000 U.S.
troops elsewhere on the continent.
   The official said he could not rule out the Soviets bringing up
the issue again as a way of making sure the United States cuts
back. But he said that probably would not happen until a second
round of bargaining is held after the treaty is finished.
   The aircraft dispute, meanwhile, is a serious roadblock.
   It involves an effort by the United States and its NATO partners
to limit Soviet airplanes that Moscow insists are defensive. The
Soviets soon will send negotiators to Washington to try to break
the deadlock, the official said.
   Baker's three-day visit here produced no serious progress on
another prospective arms control treaty - a U.S.-Soviet agreement
to cut their long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by
30 percent to 50 percent.
   Bush hopes to sign the treaty at a summit in Moscow in December.
   Gorbachev told reporters at the Kremlin that ``a lot of things
have to be done'' before there is another summit meeting.
   Later, U.S. officials confirmed none of the remaining issues in
the way of a START treaty had been settled.
   Those issues include:
   -The kinds of restrictions to be placed on the 154 heavy,
ground-based SS-18 intercontinental missiles the Soviets will
retain under the treaty.
   -Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapons, as the United States demands. That would mean
counting Backfires against numerical weapons limits established in
the treaty.
   -The restrictions to be placed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies - from the United States
to Britain, for instance.

   Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens will meet
here next week with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to discuss
developments in the Persian Gulf, sources said Thursday.
   Arens is coming to the United States on a private visit to
deliver a speech. But, in addition to meeting Cheney, he may also
hold talks with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the
sources said.
   The Israeli official was last here in mid-July, when he warned
Cheney that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein intended to invade
Kuwait. The invasion came Aug. 2.
   At the request of the United States, Israel has refrained from
taking any part in the standoff with Saddam so as not to antagonize
the U.S. coalition with Arab states opposed to Iraq.
   The United States, Egypt, Syria and the United Arab Emirates
have sent troops to Saudi Arabia to prevent Saddam from raiding the
oil-rich country.
   Israel is believed to provide the United States with
intelligence information about Iraq.

   Leaders of Latvia's parliament Thursday called for
the expulsion of Iraqi troops who they said are training at a
Soviet naval base on Latvian territory.
   There was no way to independently verify the report that Iraqi
soldiers were stationed at the Soviet Navy Training Center near the
republic's capital of Riga.
   A Canadian television station reported Wednesday that Latvian
Foreign Minister Janis Jurkans confirmed the Iraqis were being
trained at the base.
   The Soviet Union has condemned Iraq, a longtime ally, following
its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Moscow, which had been Iraq's
leading arms supplier, has cut off arms shipments to Baghdad.
   In the past, the Soviet Union has trained thousands of soldiers
from socialist states and other nations to whom it has sold
military weapons.
   Andrejs Krastins, a vice-chairman of the Latvian parliament,
told a Western reporter in Riga there were ``several dozen'' Iraqis
studying rockets and missiles at the base. He suggested Latvia
might cut off water, electricity and food to the base.
   The resolution, endorsed by the parliament's presidium, or
cabinet, expressed ``a firm and categorical protest against the
stationing and military training of soldiers from the armed forces
of the aggressor-state Iraq, which is occurring in the territory of
the Republic of Latvia and is sponsored by the military leaders of
the U.S.S.R. armed forces.''
   The resolution demanded the parliament's Defense and Internal
Affairs Commission inspect the base, that any Iraqi soldiers leave
Latvia, and that Soviet authorities provide information on all
foreign military personnel and family members in Latvia.
   Latvia, along with the neighboring Baltic republics of Lithuania
and Estonia, is seeking independence from the Soviet Union.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Thursday appointed
two veteran lawmakers to succeed ailing Cabinet members who
resigned.
   Seiroku Kajiyama, 64, is taking over the justice ministry, and
Yoshiaki Kibe, 64, will be the new state minister in charge of
Hokkaido and Okinawa development. Both are veterans of the lower

   Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto announced their
appointments at a news conference.
   It was the first change in the Cabinet since a reshuffle after
elections in February. Kaifu became prime minister in August 1989.
   Kajiyama will take over from 71-year-old Shin Hasegawa, who
announced his resignation Wednesday because of treatment for a

<HEAD>Trial Date Set for Chico Mendes Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a long judicial delay, an
Oct. 25 trial date has been set for the murder of labor leader and
rainforest defender Chico Mendes.
   A court official said Thursday the trial will be held in the
western Amazon town of Xapuri, where Mendes lived and died. A court
clerk, who asked not to be identified, said presiding Judge Aldair
Longhini had selected a 21-member jury.
   Mendes, a rubber tree tapper who led a movement to stop
destruction of the rainforest, was gunned down Dec. 22, 1988, as he
stepped onto the back porch of his wood home in Xapuri, a town
2,700 miles northwest of Rio near the Bolivian border.
   Cattle rancher Darli Alves da Silva and his sons Darcy Pereira
da Silva and Oloci Alves da Silva are charged with murder.
   The two sons recently were convicted in a separate trial for
firing on a group of rubber tappers led by Mendes in May 1988,
badly wounding two men.
   Mendes' successor, Osmarino Anancio Rodrigues, has charged that
businessmen and ranchers masterminded the Mendes shooting but have
never been called to testify.
   ``The head of the snake was not hit,'' Rodrigues said last
month. ``Those who planned it are still at large.''
   Mendes was one of the main rubber tapper leaders in the
northwestern Amazon and was honored with the United Nation's Global
500 Prize. Robert Redford is currently working on a film about his
life and Mendes has been the subject of several biographies.
   The movement Mendes led promotes the establishment of reserves
in the Amazon to collect rubber and Brazil nuts and promote
small-scale agriculture projects. The tappers say the rainforest
can be profitably developed without being destroyed.
   Slash-and-burn clearing by ranchers and farmers has destroyed an
estimated 8 percent of the 2 million-square-mile Amazon wilderness.
   Rubber tapper supporters expressed relief a trial date had
finally been set.
   ``National and international public opinion calls out for
justice in the Chico Mendes case, with exemplary punishment for his
killers,''said Jeronimo Nunes of the Roman Catholic Church-linked
Pastoral Land Commission.
   Rural conflicts between poor peasants and large landowners have
resulted in over 1,000 deaths the past decade, according to Amnesty
Intenational. Nearly all the victims have been union activists and
advisors.

<TEXT>
   German Jewish organizations on Thursday
condemned West Germany's decision to temporarily halt further
Soviet Jewish immigration.
   The West German government on Wednesday told its diplomats in
the Soviet Union to stop processing applications until a fixed
quota is established. Bonn said its consulate in Kiev had received
immigration requests from 10,000 Soviet Jews.
   Forty-five years after the Nazi Holocaust, Germany has become an
increasingly attractive destination for Soviet Jews, who are
dealing with persecution as the Soviet state is eroded and various
nationalist movements - some of them anti-Semitic - gain strength.
   West German Jewish community leader Heinz Galinski said Germany
must be willing to accept Soviet Jews, but that regulations are
needed ``to avoid chaos'' caused by huge numbers.
   Galinski, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said
he estimates 800 Soviet Jewish immigrants have reached East Germany
the last nine months. About 400 Soviet Jews have settled in West
Germany the last two years, the Bonn government said.
   Guenther Krause, a top East German negotiator, was talking with
officials in Bonn in hopes of avoiding a temporary ban like the one
that West Germany made, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported
in Munich.
   East Berlin's Jewish Cultural Union sharply criticized Bonn's
action, saying it is out of step with ``the German responsibility
toward the Jewish people.''
   Jewish leaders in East and West already are upset about the
wording of the preamble of the unification treaty between the two
German states.
   The leaders are seeking a clear statement of the Germans'
responsibility for the Holocaust that claimed the lives of an
estimated 6 million Jews. A draft of the preamble contained only
general wording about peace and democracy.
   While seeking fixed numbers for Soviet Jewish immigrants, West
Germany continues to accept thousands of asylum-seekers from
Eastern Europe and Third World countries.
   The refugees are strapping West Germany's social services, still
reeling from the influx of 500,000 East Germans the last nine
months.

   Troops backed by air cover broke a
three-month siege of Jaffna Fort on Thursday and killed at least
100 Tamil guerrillas during the surprise predawn attack, the
military said.
   It said 12 soldiers also were killed in the assault, which freed
more than 200 policemen and soldiers who had been trapped in the
fort by rebels since June 13.
   ``The assaulting battle group ... is consolidating and clearing
adjacent areas,'' said a statement issued by the military.
   It said ``heavy resistence'' by guerrillas of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam had been reported but gave no details.
   There were no independent reports on the attack from Jaffna, 185
miles northeast of Colombo. Communications have been severed since
summer while the government battled Tamil guerrillas.
   Defense Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunga said gunboats and
helicopter gunships bombarded the 17th century fort while 360
soldiers paddled across a shallow lagoon in rubber dinghies and
fought their way into the area.
   The Tigers fought back with rockets, grenades and heavy-caliber
guns, military officials said.
   An ir force plane crashed in the lagoon after the siege was
broken and the pilot bailed out but was missing, the military
statement said.
   The reports indicated the soldiers had outwitted the Tamil
Tigers by paddling across the lagoon during the aerial bombardment,
instead of trying to break across a heavily mined causeway that
leads to the rear of the star-shaped Dutch colonial fort.
   The fort is a classic of military architecture with a moat,
drawbridge, watch towers and 20-foot walls.
   Crushing the guerrilla siege was an important psychological
victory for the government forces, but its value was more symbolic
than strategic.
   The fort and nearby Jaffna town is Tiger territory, and so is
most of the surrounding peninsula, the longtime power base of the
7-year-old Tamil revolt against the Sinhalese majority that
controls Sri Lanka's government.
   Nevertheless, the massive government fort symbolizes Sinhalese
power in the peninsula.
   The government opened talks last year to try to negotiate a
peaceful settlement with the Tigers, who say they need a separate
homeland to protect the Tamil minority from discrimination by the
Sinhalese.
   The talks and a 13-month-old cease-fire broke down when the
Tigers launched a series of raids on June 11 on police stations and
army camps in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   Hundreds of unarmed policemen were massacred after surrendering
to the rebels, and the government declared it was time for all-out
war to crush the Tigers.
   The guerrillas laid siege to the fort on June 13. The government
launched its offensive on Aug. 22, but its forces became locked in
battle nearby with guerrillas.
   Meantime, helicopters swooped over the fort to drop food to the
men trapped inside. Drinking water was provided in the form of ice
blocks, which quickly melted in the tropical heat.
   At least twice helicopter pilots braved rebel fire to land at
the fort and pick up seriously wounded troops.
   Having liberated the fort, the government's next goal likely is
to take the town of Jaffna.
   The government says more than 3,000 people have been killed the
last three months, bringing the death toll to 14,000 since the
revolt began in 1983.
   The northeast is home for most of Sri Lanka's Tamils, who form
18 percent of the island's population of 16 million. Sinhalese make
up 75 percent of the people.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will ask Congress for
an additional $1.8 billion to cover costs of the military
deployment in the Persian Gulf through the end of the month,
administration and congressional sources said Thursday.
   The emergency request, to be formally submitted to Congress on
Friday, also includes an expected request to forgive $7 billion in
past military debt owed the United States by Egypt, the sources
said.
   And it includes a proposal to transfer another $900 million from
unused accounts within the Pentagon to make up the rest of the $2.7
billion additional costs imposed by Operation Desert Shield, the
sources said.
   The 1990 fiscal year ends Sept. 30. The White House hopes that
paying some of the bills from the deployment in the current year
will ease pressure at least slightly as the administration and
Congress draft a Defense Department budget for 1991, according to
the sources who spoke on condition that they not be identified.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, in visits to key
members of the House and Senate on Wednesday, argued that the debt
forgiveness for Egypt is necessary to reward an ally that has taken
a leadership role in rallying the Arab world against Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
   In the private meetings, Eagleburger has made the case that aid
to Egypt bolsters a moderate Arab state and helps to stem the
rising tide of Moslem fundamentalism in the Middle East. Egypt has
been the linchpin of U.S. efforts to mount a broad international
response to the invasion, Eagleburger argued.
   But while many lawmakers agree Egypt is worthy of a reward, they
wince at the size of the debt writeoff and worry that other U.S.
aid recipients will line up for similar largesse at a time when the
budget can ill afford it.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he has asked the administration
for a better idea of how much the debt forgiveness will cost the
United States in lost repayments each year.
   ``Egypt should be helped,'' said Leahy, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations foreign aid subcommittee. ``They do have their necks
out about as far as you can get. But there's going to be a need to
help a lot of people,'' and he would like to handle it all at once
instead of piecemeal, and with a full picture of the costs
involved, Leahy said.
   The administration official acknowledged the difficulty,
alluding to the perennial unpopularity in Congress of foreign aid:
``There's a lot of head scratching over how we are going to pull
this off 30 days before an election.''

   Struggling through its final days, East
Germany's first free government faced new charges Thursday that it
still contains the most hated remnants of the old regime.
   A prominent activist who headed a committee assigned to dissolve
the Communist secret police said 69 current lawmakers and four
ministers had worked with the secret police.
   During a 14-hour Parliament session, lawmakers bickered over the
allegations and the government's announcement the previous day that
it had purged 56 suspected secret police agents from government
posts this week.
   But they voted against demanding that Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere oust Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel, who has been
under fire for months for allowing secret police agents on his
payroll.
   Meanwhile, 22 activists who helped bring down the Communist
regime by leading protests last fall continued to occupy the
headquarters of the secret police.
   The activists, who have been occupying the headquarters since
Sept. 4 and went on a hunger strike Wednesday, are demanding public
access to the secret records kept on 6 million people.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper visited the activists Thursday
and said he supports their cause.
   The furor over the dark past was heightened by comments made by
Werner Fischer, a prominent activist who led a committee assigned
to oversee the dissolution of the Communist secret police unit.
   In an interview with the East German news agency ADN, Fischer
said there were four ministers in the government who were unoffical
members of the Stasi.
   He named Environment Minister Karl-Hermann Steinberg as ``an
example.'' Steinberg denied the accusation.
   Matthias Gehler, spokesman for the prime minister, criticized
Fischer for naming Steinberg but said de Maiziere wanted to speak
with Steinberg.
   Fischer was also quoted as saying 68 members of the 400-member
Parliament worked with the Stasi.
   In addition, he was quoted as saying Diestel fought attempts by
Fischer's committee to investigate the number of Stasi agents
working in the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for law
enforcement.
   The Stasi used threats, intimidation, surveillance, beatings and
purportedly murder to keep in check 16 million people during
Communist rule of the country.
   Former agents have said a system of favors and contacts still
exists in the goverment.
   Nearly 200,000 people were either official or unofficial members
of the network, and tens of thousands more worked as informants.
   Parliament convened Thursday to discuss aspects of a treaty that
lays many of the conditions for unifying with West Germany on Oct.
3. Much of the debate was spent on the growing obsession with the
secret police.
   Fischer headed a citizen's committee made up of activists
appointed by the caretaker government, which took over after
hard-line leader Erich Honecker was ousted from power last autumn.
   The committee had completed organizing Stasi files and materials
when it was replaced by a new committee formed after de Maiziere
was elected in March.
   The second committee last week handed the government a list of
5,000 names of undercover Stasi agents who worked in government
ministries.
   On Wednesday, the government said 56 people who were on that
list were either fired or put on leaves of absence. Most of them
worked in Diestel's department.

<HEAD>Researchers Say They've Cured Diabetes in Rats; Diabetes Group
Cautious</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 5th graf: ``The researchers,'' to make ``the
anti-rejection drug'' read ``an anti-rejection drug.''</NOTE>

   Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical Center say they've cured diabetes in rats by transplanting
clumps of cells from the pancreas to the thymus gland.
   Richard Kahn, chief scientist and medical officer for the
American Diabetes Association, said the study was important but
added: ``We should be clear that we have not found a cure for
diabetes.''
   Nearly 1 million Americans - a number that grows by 10,000 to
15,000 a year - suffer from Type One diabetes in which there are no
insulin-producing cells, called islets, in the pancreas. A far
greater number suffer from Type Two diabetes in which the body
produces some - but not enough - insulin.
   The missing insulin must be replaced by daily injections.
   The researchers said the thymus implants restored the blood
sugar in the rats to normal levels and permanently cured the
diabetes with only a single dose of an anti-rejection drug.
   A team led by Dr. Clyde Barker was the first to cure diabetes in
animals by islet transplantation 17 years ago. But the islets were
rejected within a few days without continuing heavy doses of
anti-rejection drugs.
   The latest findings were detailed in Friday's edition of Science
magazine. Barker, chief of surgery at the Penn Medical Center,
co-authored the report.
   ``This is the first indication that we can engraft foreign
islets and restore normal glucose to diabetic individuals without
subjecting them to chronic, long-life immunosuppression with side
effects,'' said Ali Naji, professor of surgery at Penn.
   The thymus didn't reject the implants of pancreatic islets and
didn't require repeated injection to lower the rats' immune
response, a finding that surprised the researchers.
   Kahn said the study helps in the understanding of the body's
immune system, but he doubts whether it holds hope for human
diabetics.
   ``The reason it is slim is that your thymus gland all but
disappears before the age of 2, so that it's very difficult to find
any trace of the thymus gland,'' Kahn said. ``We don't know how it
functions after that period, so it's questionable if this is of
clinical significance.''
   In April, researchers at Washington University said a similar
transplant of insulin-producing cells into the liver of a woman
with diabetes enabled her to go without daily insulin injections
for more than two weeks. But the woman's body then began to reject
the transplant.
   Andrew Posselt, an M.D.-Ph.D. student at Penn who conducted the
experiment, said the thymus is well-suited for the transplantation
of islets.
   The gland, near the thyroid gland at the base of the neck,
doesn't permit white blood cells to enter the organ easily, which
makes it a protective site from the immune system.
   Also, the cells in the thymus can differentiate between
substances in its own body and foreign substances, Posselt said.
   ``So if islets are transplanted into the thymus, we think that
the cells can be tricked into thinking that the foreign tissue is
actually part of its own body, and the immune system won't be able
to respond to it,'' Posselt said.
   Posselt said the blood sugar levels in the rats remained normal
for more than 200 days and some are still working normally after
about 17 months.

Advancement of Science.

   The United States admitted 107,000 refugees in
1989, the highest influx in a decade, the Department of Health and
Human Services said Thursday.
   Of the 107,000, 39,414 came from the Soviet Union, 37,066 from
Southeast Asia, 4,826 from Iran, 3,808 from Cuba, 1,745 from
Afghanistan and 1,724 from Ethiopia.
   Amerasians - children with a Vietnamese mother and American
father - comprised 8,721 of the total, HHS said.
   Since 1975, the United States has admitted more than 1.3 million
refugees, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said in an annual report to
Congress.
   ``I am proud that we are able to welcome these refugees to our
country and to assist them in their quest for self-sufficiency,''
Sullivan said in a statement.
   The 107,000 was an increase of 31,000 from 1988. It was the
largest number of refugees since 1981.
   Through English language and vocational training programs, more
than 24,000 refugees were placed in unsubsidized employment last
year, said Jo Anne B. Barnhart, HHS assistant secretary for family
support.
   ``These individuals and their families are now repaying this
country through their work efforts and their tax dollars,''
Barnhart said.
   HHS reimburses states for costs of providing cash and medical
assistance to refugees during their initial months in the United
States.

<HEAD>Panama Invasion Cost Nearly $164 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department estimates that the cost
of the U.S. invasion of Panama last December was about $163.6
million, says a congressional report released Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found that the incremental cost for Operation Just Cause
was about $155 million for the Army, $5.7 million for the Air Force
and $2.9 million for the Navy.
   The incremental expense represents the cost over and about the
price for normal operations.
   The invasion that began in the early morning hours Dec. 20, 1989
and lasted until Jan. 31 involved 27,000 U.S. troops, including
13,000 who were stationed in Panama.
   The objective of Operation Just Cause was to remove Panamanian
leader Manuel Noriega, who had been indicted in the United States
on drug charges.
   The GAO based its report on estimates from the military services
and did not independently verify the numbers.
   Among the costs associated with Operation Just Cause were
expenses incurred prior to the invasion, including practice
missions and the price of evacuating military dependents.
   Other expenses included replacing aircraft and vehicles lost
during the operation, the price of ammunition and allowances paid
to military personnel, including imminent danger pay and family
separation pay.
   The release of the costs associated with the Panama invasion
comes as the Bush administration is estimating that the U.S.
military buildup to deter Iraqi aggression could cost as much as
$15 billion in the next fiscal year.

   The leading candidate to head the Food and
Drug Administration is David A. Kessler, medical director of the
Albert Einstein medical school in New York, sources said Thursday.
   Though Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has
not sent Kessler's name to the White House, he is said to be the
secretary's choice to lead the agency, said sources who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   The top spot at FDA has been vacant since Frank Young resigned
under pressure nearly a year ago. James Benson has been acting FDA
commissioner pending appointment of a permanent successor.
   Kessler was a consultant to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for
several years in the early 1980s.
   He is a member of an HHS advisory commission that was formed to
study problems at the agency, which has been under scrutiny since
an investigation of its generic drug division uncovered evidence of
fraud and bribery last year.
   Kessler earned a medical degree from Harvard and a law degree
from the University of Chicago.

   Rain extended over most of the nation Thursday, causing flooding
in Texas and some southern states. Cooler weather was forecast in
sizzling Nebraska.
   Flooding was expected Friday across a portion of southeast Texas
from Palacios to Huntsville. There was minor flooding Thursday in
northwest Georgia.
   Afternoon showers and thunderstorms extended from the Texas
coast across Louisiana to Florida, along the East Coast into
eastern Pennsylvania and in northwest Minnesota and North Dakota.
   Low pressure over northern North Dakota moved east Thursday,
while a cool front trailed southwest across the northern Plains
toward northwest Nebraska.
   The National Weather Service said the front would bring rain and
cooler weather Friday to Nebraska.
   Nebraska has sizzled for most of September, with temperatures in
the high 90s accompanied by high humidity. Many schools suspended
classes because of the weather.
   In Colorado, unseasonable highs continued. By early afternoon,
Colorado Springs reached 88 degrees, tying a heat record for the
date. Pueblo reached 97, breaking a record of 96 degrees last
reached in 1956.
   Fog forced air traffic controllers to shut down Greater
Cincinnati International Airport and nine satellite regional
airports for about an hour Thursday morning.
   The dense fog was caused by a combination of humidity, rain, wet
ground conditions and cooler air that reached the region Thursday.
   Temperatures aroun the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Caribou, Maine, to 103 degrees at Twentynine Palms,
Calif.
   The lowest temperature in the nation Thursday was 29 degrees at

<TEXT>
   The top American military commander
extolled troops in the Saudi desert Thursday to ``bear with me'' as
evidence mounted the deployment of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf
region will be a prolonged one.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told Army infantrymen during a pep talk at their desert camp that
they had the support of President Bush and the American public for
their mission.
   ``Don't think I ever forget that you have loved ones back
home,'' Powell added.
   But at each of a half-dozen stops at Army, Air Force and Marine
camps, the four-star general, clad in desert camouflage, was
pressed by servicemen about the likely length of their stay.
   ``I want to get you home as fast as possible but bear with me,''
Powell said. ``I can't give you an exact date.''
   At a news conference, Powell said rotations of troops will start
``as soon as possible,'' a welcome message for the troops but
another sign that military planners foresee a lengthy deployment.
   ``Even if Iraq pulled out starting tomorrow, I'd be here
probably six months minimum,'' one general who met with Powell
said, asking that he not be named.
   Powell, who later flew to Bahrain, refused to say how long the
Bush administration would tolerate Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, now
in its sixth week.
   Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia,
said his forces were strong enough to stop an Iraqi attack now but
the infusion of more armored units the next two months will provide
a ``100 percent chance'' of winning any battle.
   ``Give me a couple of months and I'll be able to stand up and
say ... there is absolutely no question whatsoever'' of the
outcome, Schwarzkopf said.
   If Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were to order an attack now,
``I feel confident we could handle the problem and he would suffer
extraordinary losses. But I still do not have the ground forces of
choice that I need to fight a mobile war in the desert,'' he said.
   A senior U.S. officer who spoke on condition he not be named
said no end to the U.S. military presence is in sight. He all but
ruled out a unilateral U.S. military action to force Iraqi forces
from Kuwait.
   ``It's the classic Mexican standoff,'' said the official. ``I
wouldn't want to launch an offensive against Kuwait with
150,000-200,000 troops on the ground. ... And I don't think Saddam
Hussein is going to leave.''
   Powell said the mission of the American troops remained a
defensive one and that the U.S. forces would leave when asked to by
the Saudi government.
   ``We have no desire to have any permanent presence,'' he said.
   The U.S. deployment to the region, including sailors and
Marines, now is about 145,000 men and women.
   Powell said the U.S. deployment was behind schedule because of
delayed transport ships and a limited airlift capacity.
   ``You're bound to have glitches,'' he said. But most vital heavy
gear was here or nearing Saudi ports, he said.
   Schwarzkopf, interviewed at the headquarters of U.S. forces,
said the flow of equipment for American forces into Saudi Arabia
was eight days behind schedule because of logistical problems,
including two broken-down Navy ships.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said the fast sealift ship Antares
was transferring its goods to another fast ship at Spain's port of
Rota. Another ship has engine problems in the Atlantic and may need
to be towed, Hall said.
   Powell played down suggestions there would be command problems
directing a multinational forces in combat, saying if hostilities
erupted, a command structure could be put in place.
   Powell planned to visit a Navy ship Friday.

   Florida's Lotto jackpot reached $100
million Thursday with tickets for Saturday's drawing selling at a
rate of 500 a second.
   Players poured in from other states and countries with dreams of
becoming millionaires, or of making a few bucks selling the $1
tickets at a higher price to those who could not make it to
Florida. The tickets are not sold outside the state.
   Two men from New Orleans, Joe Revolta and Robert Bache, plunked
down $10,000 in cash Wednesday for 10,000 tickets at Groovin'
Noovin's, a Pensacola convenience store near the Alabama-Florida
state line.
   ``It's on our news in Louisiana constantly,'' Revolta said.
``You might not have much of a chance, but you have even less if
you don't play.''
   State lottery officials on Thursday increased the jackpot to
$100 million, the second largest in U.S. history, but said they
doubted it would break the record of $115 million. The expected
jackpot is based on sales and projected sales through Saturday.
   About 30 people flew from Atlanta to Pensacola Regional Airport
early Wednesday, bought tickets at a nearby convenience store and
went home, said Gene Mumtzis of Eagle Travel.
   ``One guy said he goes to California, Ohio and everywhere else
to buy tickets,'' Mumtzis said.
   Richard Cardone, owner of a Pittsburgh beauty salon, bought 50
tickets during an airline stopover in West Palm Beach.
   ``Who wouldn't play?'' asked Cardone. ``You'd be a fool not to.
Everybody's fantasy is to be a multimillionaire.''
   Bahamians carrying thousands of dollars are flying to south
Florida to buy tickets tosell at a higher price back home, the
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported.
   ``They come every Friday. This week they will bring $4,000 to
$5,000,'' said George Prado, who sells lottery tickets at the
Caribe Cafeteria, a Cuban restaurant near Miami International
Airport.
   To play the Florida Lotto game, players select six numbers from
one to 49. The winning numbers are chosen at random during a
weekly, televised drawing.
   The odds of one ticket containing all six winning numbers are
about one-in-14 million. But for every dollar spent, there was a
dream.
   ``First, I would help the church in any way I could, then I
would buy a ticket to fly to the moon,'' said Anne Straub, 66, of
Gulf Breeze. ``I've just always wanted to go into space.''
   On Thursday, tickets sold at a rate of 500 a second, said
Florida Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The highest sales were reported along the state's lines with
Georgia and Alabama, she said.
   Results of Saturday night's drawing would be announced Sunday,
although the final size of the jackpot would not be determined
until Monday, she said.
   The record jackpot of $115 million was split among 14 winning
tickets in Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was a $58 million jackpot
split between five winners in April. Each winning ticket was worth
nearly $11.7 million, to be paid out over 20 years.
   Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs holds the world record for a
prize to a single winner of a computerized numbers game. She won a
$55.1 million Florida Lotto jackpot in September 1988.
   In Florida, 50 percent of each dollar spent on the lottery is
returned in prizes, 38 percent goes to the state's schools system
and the rest is split between retailers and the lottery department.

<TEXT>
   Forty-three Marilyn Monroe look-a-likes
fanned out through a downtown plaza Thursday in a stunt stemming
from the sex symbol's roots - as an artichoke queen.
   The show was designed to convince the public that ``artichokes,
not diamonds, are a girl's best friend.''
   Why 43?
   Because 43 years ago Marilyn Monroe was the first official
California Artichoke Queen, said Patty Boman of the California
Artichoke Advisory Board.
   ``Artichoke growers believe that during Marilyn's reign more
people than ever before were inspired to eat artichokes,'' she
said.
   It was no coincidence, Boman noted, that the two-day Castroville
Artichoke Festival starts Saturday. Castroville, 40 miles south of
San Francisco, is dubbed the artichoke capital of the world.
   The women were costumed to resemble Monroe in her role in the
movie ``The Seven Year Itch.'' All were topped by blonde wigs and
wore white satin dresses.
   The platoon of photographers that showed up at Justin Herman
Plaza on the waterfront snapped away as one of the Marilyns, also
known as Dianna Dawn, attempted to duplicate the famous scene in
the movie in which a gust of air raises the star's dress to display
her legs.
   Dawn and her colleagues circulated through the lunch time crowd
to distribute artichoke leaves as songs by Monroe flowed from a
loud speaker. The tunes included ``A Fine Romance,'' ``I Want to Be
Loved By You'' and ``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.''
   The 43 lined up behind tuxedo-clad Castroville artichoke grower
Dale Huss, who told the crowd that ``artichokes, not diamonds, are
a girl's best friend.''
   ``Tell us about you reign as queen in 1947,'' Huss asked Dawn,
who does a fairly good impression of Monroe.
   ``I always eat artichokes when it rains,'' she answered.
   The problem with artichokes, said Boman, is not enough people
know how good they are, or even that the vegetable exists.
   ``We measure in terms of cartons,'' she said. ``Last year we
sold 4.2 million cartons. Most of that was on the West Coast. A
shocking proportion of Bay area residents have never tried
artichokes.''
   Artichoke leaves are usually peeled off and dipped in a sauce.
Then the choke is removed and the heart is scooped out and
consumed. Some eateries offer the hearts deep-fried.
   The samples passed out by the look-a-likes went fast.
   Monroe is still big business, according to Roger Richman who
represents the estate of the actress who committed suicide in 1962.
   He said 89 companies in the United States are licensed to use
the name and likeness of the star of such movies as ``Some Like It
Hot,'' and ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.''
   The stint as Artichoke Queen must have helped her career.
   Richman noted that she made her first film a year later. It was
a bit part in something called ``Scudda-Hoo! Scudda-Hay!''

<HEAD>Senate Begins Debate Over Tougher Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate will be asked to renew the 55 mile
sper hour national speed limit as an alternative to required
increases in new-car gasoline mileage, a Michigan senator told his
colleagues Thursday.
   ``If we want to cut down on the amount of gasoline being used,
we can put the 55 mph speed limit back in ... and we'll burn a lot
less gas and we'll save energy right now, today,'' said Sen. Donald
Riegle, D-Mich. in preliminary debate on a fuel-efficiency measure.
   The provision is strenously opposed by the auto industry,
headquartered in Riegle's home state, and hailed by
conservationists as one of the most important steps possible to
reduce demand for oil.
   Riegle and Sen. Carl Levin, also D-Mich., urged their colleagues
to postpone action on the fuel economy bill until next year, when
it could be considered as part of a comprehensive energy program.
   But proponents said there was no reason to delay a new standard
that would reduce U.S. deendence on foreign oil and reduce carbon
dioxide emissions, one cause of the global warming predicted by
many scientists.
   ``It does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we don't
start conserving now, some future president may have to consider
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the Middle
East,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., the bill's chief sponsor.
   The bill would require automakers to boost the average mileage
of new car fleets by 20 percent by 1995 and about 40 percent by the
year 2001, or about 40 miles per gallon in the current government
test.
   Both a 55-mph speed limit and the fuel economy requriement, now
27.5 mpg, were required by Congress as fuel-saving measures in the
wake of the 1973 oil embargo. By 1986, the speed limit was widely
ignored and Congress relaxed it, giving states then option of a
65-mph limit on rural interstate highways. Most have done so.
   Although senators discussed the pros and cons of the bill
Thursday, the question actually at hand was whether to bring it up
for consideration.
   A vote is expected Friday on a motion to officially open debate.
It is regarded as a key test of the degree of support for the bill.
   If the motion passes, opponents have signaled they would mount a
filibuster and offer a string of amendments in a bid to derail the
measure.
   Levin told the Senate he could support some increase in fuel
efficiency standards as part of an overall conservation package.
But he said the Bryan bill was ``not a reasonable and balanced
approach.''

<HEAD>Government Approves Austerity Plan to Absorb Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Cabinet on Thursday adopted an
economic plan that includes tax increases to help pay for the
settlement of the 1 million Soviet immigrants expected by the end
of the decade.
   The plan also is meant to turn Israel's socialist-style economy
into a more capitalist one.
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai presented it during a marathon
10-hour Cabinet meeting.
   Parliament must approve the plan, which is expected to meet
stiff opposition from left-wing parties.
   Israel radio said the government expected it to raise at least
$500 million over the next year, but a proposal to impose a 16
percent tax on fruits and vegetables and on tourism was not
approved. A special ministerial committee was appointed to discuss
that measure.
   The Cabinet did approve Modai's proposal to impose a 20 percent
tax on lottery winnings and on earnings from pension and saving
plans, a 16 percent tax on cigarettes and a 14 percent tax on beer.
It also approved a proposal to ease restrictions on capital markets
to encourage outside and domestic investment.
   ``What we are trying to do is remove taxes or burdens which are
stopping growth and transfer them to things which do not affect
growth,'' Modai said at a news conference.
   One measure likely to meet stiff resistance in Parliament is a
proposal to lower the minimum wage for some workers as an incentive
to employers to create more jobs.
   Under the plan, employers would not have to pay immigrants the
minimum wage, about $475 dollars a month, for their first half year
of employment.
   Ora Namir, a legislator for the left-of-center Labor Party that
runs the Histadrut Labor Union vowed she and her party would
``launch a tremendous struggle,'' against that proposal.
   Former Finance Minister Shimon Peres said the plan would not
help the immigration problems.
   ``I don't see a plan for the absorption of 250,000 immigrants,
nor a plan for stabilizing the economy,'' Peres, leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said on Israel television. ``The government
made no decisions about its own budget, about its policy on
salaries or war on inflation.''
   Already the nearly 90,000 Soviet Jews who have arrived this year
face severe housing and job shortages. Officials estimate it will
cost $20 billion to $30 billion to provide housing and jobs for the
Soviets the next two years.

<HEAD>New Round of Salvadoran Peace Talks Starts Amid Heavy Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran peace negotiators on
Thursday began their fifth round of talks this year, and Salvador's
army reported renewed fighting between government and rebel troops.
   The army said without elaborating that 61 rebels and soldiers
were killed or injured and five civilians injured in stepped-up
fighting Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
   At least 73,000 people have been killed in the nearly
11-year-old civil war.
   Representatives of President Alfredo Cristiani's conservative,
U.S.-backed administration and leaders of the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, agreed this year in
Venezuela to try to reach a cease-fire by Saturday. But the two
have reached an impasse in their talks on the issue of military
reforms, which the guerrillas have been demanding.
   The negotiating teams appeared to not to have yet resolved the
issue of army reforms as they began the talks in Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Ship Recovers Debris in Area Where Jet Went Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searchers recovered debris
Thursday in the area where a missing jetliner was believed to have
ditched in the North Atlantic with 16 people aboard.
   The Boeing 727 disappeared Tuesday off Newfoundland.
   Transport Canada spokesman Dick Pepper said a Canadian Forces
search plane spotted the debris, and a Coast Guard ship dispatched
to the area retrieved five plastic-foam cylinders about 240 miles
southeast of Cape Race.
   Pepper said he did not know what their use was. He described
them as ``five hard-packed Styrofoam cylinders, 14 inches in
length, 4} inches in diameter, with brass screws in one end.''
   The site is in the middle of a major ocean shipping lane, so the
debris could have come from passing ships and not the missing jet,
he said.
   The jet, owned by Faucett Airlines of Peru and carrying Peruvian
airline crew members and their relatives, disappeared Tuesday
afternoon after the pilot radioed that he was short of fuel.
   The plane was headed for a refueling stop in Gander,
Newfoundland, en route to Miami from the Mediterranean island of
Malta.
   Pepper said the rain and fog off Newfoundland's southern coast
was hampering the search for the plane.
   If it ditched successfully, there was only a slim chance the
plane would be afloat after two days, he said. But if the plane was
equipped with life rafts the crew could have escaped, he said.
   Maj. Walt Chipchase, spokesman for the Canadian Forces, said the
plane carried one 22-person liferaft.

   A 4-year-old girl was being prepared to become
the first patient to receive gene therapy in a study that
scientists say could revolutionize he treatment of disease,
officials said Thursday.
   Researchers at the National Institutes of Health said they
expected to be ready to begin the gene-restoration treatment Friday
on the child, who was born with a defective immune system unable to
fight infections and diseases.
   Scientists said they do not expect to see results from the
treatment during the first few months. But if successful, it would
put researchers on a new frontier in medicine that could lead to
similar treatments for cancer, hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, AIDS
and other diseases.
   ``We feel that this is potentially a major new therapy option
that should have significant clinical effects in the next
century,'' said Dr. W. French Anderson, a researcher at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at NIH.
   ``It's very exciting,'' said R. Michael Blaese, an immunology
expert at the National Cancer Institute.
   Because of the potential of the therapy and the importance of
the testing, Anderson said researchers are beginning slowly and
cautiously with their first patient.
   The child, who was not identified, has a rare genetic disease
called ADA deficiency - a defective gene which means her immune
system does not function adequately because the enzyme it produces
is defective. This leaves her vulnerable to infections and diseases
most people can fight off.
   Only about 10 children a year are born with the disease. Without
treatment they die within the first two years of life.
   The best current treatment is a bone marrow transplant with a
donor whose tissue type matches the child's, such as from a brother
or sister. Experts say most children do not have a matched donor.
   For the children without a match, their options are a partially
matched bone marrow transplant, which fails half the time, or
enzyme replacement therapy with a drug called PEG-ADA. Weekly
injections of the new drug decreases the severity of infections for
some patients, but it does not fully restore their immune systems.
   Researchers have already begun the initial work necessary for
the first patient's treatment. Weeks ago, they took white cells
from some of her blood and began growing them in tissue culture.
Then they inserted a normal ADA gene into these cells with a
genetically engineered virus. The virus has been disabled and is no
longer infectious, but serves as a vehicle to get the normal gene
into the cells where it produces the required enzyme.
   Once a sufficient number of ADA-corrected cells have been grown,
they are infused into the patient intravenously.
   In the case of this first patient, scientists expect to give her
about 1 billion cells - about a small thimbleful - mixed in a
saline solution in the first infusion.
   The treatments will be given once a month for about two years.
   The experiment, first proposed by NIH in April 1987, was
recommended for approval by an advisory committee July 31 and was
approved by NIH last week. The Food and Drug Administration gave
its go-ahead Thursday afternoon, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says she is
criticized for qualities that are admired in men.
   ``The characteristics that they criticize you for, that you are
strong-minded, that you make firm and tough decisions, are also
characteristics which, if you were a man, they would praise you
for,'' she said in an interview published Thursday in the October
issue of Woman's Journal.
   ``I think they have not yet fully come to terms with that.''
   Mrs. Thatcher continued: ``If you do anything good, then you
have got an ulterior motive, and so you are, naturally, like any
female of the species, defending yourself and defending everything
in which you believe.''
   There is one advantage of being a woman in politics, she said.
   ``If we have a big international conference, they will always
know the president of the United States, they will always know the
president of the Soviet Union and, being a woman, I am the other

   An appeals court Thursday overturned a judge's
unprecedented order that halted distribution of a new book about
the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
   The Israeli government, which won the temporary restraining
order Wednesday, failed to prove that its agents' lives were
endangered, said a statement by a four-judge panel of the state
Appellate Division.
   The panel also said that with 17,000 books already shipped to
stores, ``any grant of injunctive relief in this case would be
ineffective.''
   ``We think it's a victory for a free press and we are going to
sell the book again,'' said Roy Gainsburg, president of the book's
publisher, St. Martin's Press. ``It's the only decision. We're
grateful to the appellate court for acting quickly.''
   He said Israel might appeal to the state Court of Appeals, but
added, ``We are starting to tell the bookstores that they can sell
the books.''
   ``Orders have increased dramatically, which is what always
happens when you try to stop a book,'' he added.
   Reacting to the latest decision, the Israeli Embassy in
Washington accused author Victor Ostrovsky of placing personal
profit above agents' lives.
   The book violates Ostrovsky's ``pledge of allegiance towards his
country,'' it said in a statement.
   A hearing in state court scheduled for Friday on Israel's
request for a permanent stay was canceled.
   The original ruling by Justice Michael Dontzin had been roundly
criticized by First Amendment experts.
   Richard Winfield of Rogers &amp; Wells called it ``without precedent
and egregious''; it was ``an aberration,'' said Floyd Abrams of
Cahill, Gordon &amp; Reindell; ``Prior restraint is basically a
no-no,'' said Richard Green of Green &amp; Hillman.
   They said it apparently marked the first time a foreign nation
sought to stop publication in the United States, and predicted the
ruling would not stand for long.
   Following a midnight hearing in his apartment, Dontzin on
Wednesday temporarily barred St. Martin's from distributing ``By
Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer'' by
Ostrovsky, who says he served in the spy agency for four years in
the 1980s.
   The book contends Israel had detailed information about
preparations for the bombing that killed 241 Marines in Lebanon in
1983, but only gave the United States a vague warning to damage
U.S.-Arab relations.
   In an interview Wednesday, Ostrovsky said agents have threatened
his life. He said two of his former commanders turned up at his
home in suburban Ottawa at night a week ago.
   ``They said that it's better for me that I don't write it. They
told me to stop it,'' he said. ``I will have to be on the move more
or less for the rest of my life.''
   Dontzin issued the ruling at the request of the Israeli
government, which claims the book could imperil Mossad agents by
blowing their cover. It also implies that Mossad agents agree in
writing to keep details of their work secret after leaving the
service.
   Lawyers for the publisher immediately appealed the decision. The
book's distribution also has been restrained by a judge in Toronto.
   Under terms set out in a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions,
a litigant seeking to stop publication must shoulder a huge
evidential burden - perhaps show that life could be lost - and
assure a court that its order could, in fact, stop dissemination of
the objectionable material.
   ``In this case, the book is already out and around town,'' said
Abrams. ``Under these conditions, this ruling is literally
unthinkable. It is not a close case.''
   St. Martin's had shipped out about 17,000 books before Dontzin's
ruling, which included instructions that the publishing house
contact its customers and tell them not to sell the book.
   Thomas McCormick, chairman of the house, said St. Martin's made
telephone calls or sent telegrams to about 400 locations. Many of
the books had been sent to wholesalers, who in turn had to make
hundreds of additional calls to stores.
   McCormick said St. Martin's merely asked its customers not to
sell the books. ``We have no authority to order them to do
anything,'' he said. ``We simply complied with the judge's order.''
   ``It certainly has been reported to us that books have been
sold, and we had mailed out about 35 review copies to begin with,''
he added.
   Jonathan Lerner, a New York lawyer representing the Israeli
government, was asked if the distribution had doomed his case.
   ``I can't say to what extent you can put the genie back in the
bottle, because I don't know to what extent it's already out,'' he
said.
   Like the other lawyers, Lerner said he knew of no precedent for
a foreign government seeking to bar publication of material in this
country.
   Even if publication could have been stopped, the argument that
Israeli lives were jeopardized does not justify prior restraint,
Abrams said: ``The usual answer is that there's been enough time to
withdraw agents or take other steps.''
   The Israeli action also raised the issue of an American court's
obligation to a foreign government.
   Although the Supreme Court has not upheld a request for prior
judicial restraint for more than 50 years, the court once
speculated that the government might be entitled to prior restraint
in a case involving reports of troop movements during wartime.
   If under such circumstances a court could stop publication to
save American lives, must it do the same for Israeli ones?
   Winfield, chairman of the state Bar Association's committee on
media law, noted that the high court had rejected the government's
strong national security argument when it allowed newspapers to
publish the Pentagon Papers on the Vietnam War two decades ago.
   ``It's doubtful that an American court is obligated to give the
same weight to the security interests of a foreign government that
it gives to its own.''

   A jet carrying 263 former hostages from
Kuwait, most of them women and children, arrived Thursday to a
greeting of flags, balloons and a knot of anxious relatives.
   The predominant image was of women with babies in their arms as
the passengers slowly stepped down the exit ramp at Raleigh-Durham
International Airport. Soldiers formed a human cordon to the
terminal, and occasionally lifted a straggling child to help a
mother.
   Lorri Zeidan from Riverside, Calif., said she was in Kuwait City
with her husband and year-old son, Kamel, when Iraq invaded Aug. 2.
Her husband, Khalid, is Palestinian and remained in Kuwait.
   ``I didn't have to hide,'' she said. ``I didn't feel like a
hostage. Everything that's American they blew up.''
   But she added, ``You feel like you live in a prison. It's
awful.''
   A crying woman who didn't give her name said: ``It's great to be
here. I want to say `Hi' to all my friends I left behind in Kuwait
and I hope they make it.''
   The mood inside the airport terminal was almost somber, the
quiet broken by scattered applause when more hostages entered the
building. Each arriving adult received a yellow carnation and each
child got a toy.
   The plane carried 147 children under age 12 and, of those, 37
under age 2, according to Graham Wilson, spokesman for the North
Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.
   Iraq is allowing Western women and children to leave Iraq and
Kuwait, but is keeping most Western men behind to serve as
deterrents to an attack by the United States and its allies.
   Authorities said the passenger list included one woman 8{ months
pregnant and five unaccompanied children. Also aboard the plane
were five cats, two of which belonged to diplomats, Wilson said.
   A vacant terminal was turned into a makeshift refugee center,
with an old gift shop used as a registration center and the main
waiting room converted into a dining area with long tables covered
with dark green tablecloths. A restaurant was set up as a
short-term day-care center.
   Welcoming banners were hung in some areas. Red, white and blue
ribbons and balloons dangled elsewhere.
   The airport's baggage claim and transportation areas were turned
into reception centers for people trying to get airline tickets to
their homes, or hotel reservations nearby.
   Relatives at the airport waited for their loved ones to go
through customs before they could greet them.
   Patricia Smith of Jacksonville said she was waiting for her
sister, Leona, and six children to get off the plane.
   ``As far as I know she's doing all right,'' Ms. Smith said.
``She's just glad to get back and I'm glad she's coming back. She's
upset because her husband is still back there and he hasn't been
able to leave yet.''

Maggio.
   Kachel of Plainfield suffered severe chest injuries when his car
rolled over in the storms, Maggio said.
   Tornadoes ripped through Plainfield, Joliet and Crest Hill on
Aug. 28, injuring more than 300 people. Property damage has been
estimated at more than $100 million.

   New taxes proposed by Republicans at the
budget summit would cost low- and moderate-income Americans $4.1
billion next year while slashing taxes by $11 billion for those
better off, according to documents obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press.
   A Democratic offer would lower by $4 billion the taxes paid by
people with incomes below $20,000, while boosting them by $26.8
billion for everyone else, the papers show.
   In the Republican plan, the biggest break, $7.4 billion, would
go to people with incomes of more than $200,000.
   The estimated distribution of both tax proposals was calculated
by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee. The documents were
made available on condition that the identities of the sources be
withheld.
   The GOP plan included cutting the capital gains tax rate,
limiting the deductability of state and local income taxes, a tax
on petroleum fuels and higher alcohol taxes. It also contained a
proposal to increase excise taxes, extend the soon-to-expire 3
percent tax on telephone calls and change in the child care tax
credit.
   The Democratic proposal included a 20 percent surtax on the
income taxes paid by people earning more than $500,000 annually. It
would double the beer tax of 16-cents-per-sixpack and the
3-cent-per bottle tax on wine, and boost the $12.50 per gallon levy
on spirits by $2.
   It would increase the 9-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax by
11 cents, and put a 4 percent sales tax on other forms of energy.
   It also contemplates extending the 1.45 percent payroll tax
people pay on their first $51,300 of wages each year to all of
their additional income, if any. The tax goes to the costs of
hospital care provided by Medicare.
   The documents did not provide additional detail on the taxes in
the Republican roposal.
   Under the GOP plan, people earning $50,000 annually or less
would have to pay higher taxes totaling $4.1 billion. Americans
with incomes above that amount would receive breaks worth $11
billion, the documents showed.
   One official, demanding anonymity, said Republicans offered the
package Thursday at ongoing negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington.
   The document describing the Democratic plan was dated Tuesday,
fifth day of the 7-day-old talks. But it was unclear when the
proposal was actually presented at the bargaining table.
   Officials, demanding anonymity, said the bargainers were
beginning to be pressured by interest groups objecting to proposals
such as higher taxes on beer and boosting the payments Medicare
recipients make. Differences remained over major stumbling blocks
such as cuts to domestic programs and President Bush's desire to
cut the capital gains tax rate.
   ``There is no single issue holding it up,'' House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., said of the talks. ``There are a lot of tough
issues.''
   Foley said he expected the bargaining at Andrews Air Force Base
in Maryland, 10 miles from Washington, to conclude by Sunday.
   Both sides have discussed the possibility of increasing the
$28.60 monthly Medicare premium - which covers doctors' bills - for
better-off recipients. It would be the first time the program's
costs were adjusted to the income of the senior citizens it serves.
   But officials involved in the talks said they would not be
surprised to see the proposal toned down or withdrawn in light of
the tremendous opposition the idea is attracting. The 33 million
senior citizens covered by Medicare are considered a potent voting
bloc.
   ``We believe that proposal is a non-starter,'' said Martin
Corry, lobbyist for the American Association for Retired Persons,
the nation's largest senior citizens' group.
   Bargainers considered limiting a tax increase on cigarettes to 8
cents per pack, said one official who asked to not be identified.
On Wednesday they had discussed doubling the current 16-cent levy.
   Anheuser-Busch Inc., the nation's largest brewer, began
submerging congressional offices with more than 1 million letters
and 1.3 million petition signatures it has drummed up in a
well-advertised campaign to block higher beer taxes.
   ``We hope this will convince the negotiators that beer drinkers
don't want to see this kind of discriminatory tax, but we'll see,''
said Anheuser-Busch spokesman Mark Abels.
   One official said that bargainers were now discussing boosting
levies on alcohol by $14 billion over five years instead of by $18
billion. But the official did not know what specific taxes would be
applied to beer, wine or spirits under those figures.
   Although details of the bargaining continued to seep out of
Andrews, participants continued trying their best to staunch that
flow.
   As an example, Foley was asked by reporters if the negotiators
had reached agreement on any issues.
   ``I think probably maters that I would consider settled - but I
wouldn't want to, under torture, tell you what they are,'' he
responded.

<HEAD>Swiss Bank Withdraws Offer To Guarantee Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss bank has withdrawn its offer to
guarantee $50 million in loans to Philadelphia and Gov. Robert
Casey said Thursday the state could not provide even short-term
relief to the near-bankrupt city.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode on Wednesday postponed the city's attempt
to sell $375 million in short-term notes rather than face
unacceptably high interest rates. The Swiss Bank Corp. withdrew its
guarantee of $50 million in temporary loan notes, saying the city
failed to meet ``certain conditions.''
   Goode met with Council members Thursday and said he was ``in
serious discussion'' with Casey and Robert O'Donnell, a
Philadelphia Democrat who is speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly.
Goode and Casey are also Democrats.
   ``In a week I'm going to report where we are,'' the mayor said.
   In Harrisburg, Casey said there was still hope that the notes
could be sold. When asked if the state could make a short-term loan
to the city, he said, ``Obviously no. ... Our budget is closed at
this point.''
   Casey said he told Goode that city officials and the business
community must work together to solve the crisis.
   ``The responsibility still remains with the elected leadership
of that city,'' the governor said. ``I don't look at this in
political terms. We've been helpful to the city of Philadelphia
(but) we have an entire state to take care of.''
   The city's finance director, Betsy Reveal, said legal action
against the Swiss Bank Corp. was being considered.
   Reveal said city officials signed a contract with the bank and
met all conditions. The bank said only that the city failed to meet
``certain conditions.''
   Goode has said the city would be broke by late this month unless
it receives a cash infusion, and sought to sell the loan notes.
   The greater the risk that a city would be unable to pay its
debts, the higher the interest it must offer to buyers of its loan
notes.
   The notes would be repaid from property and business tax
receipts expected early next year. Even so, the city projects a
$206.4 million deficit in its $2.1 billion budget by next June.
   Four local banks last week rejected a city request to guarantee
notes.

<HEAD>Hubble Error Due to Upside-down Measuring Rod</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-foot metal rod accidentally put in
upside-down caused the flaw in the Hubble Space Telescope's primary
mirror, NASA investigators said Thursday.
   ``It is, unfortunately, an error we now believe an operator is
likely to have made,'' said Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, who led the investigative team.
   ``It was a technical error made by people of good will who made
a mistake,'' he said.
   The team on Thursday concluded two days of meetings at Hughes
Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which manufactured the $1.5 billion
telescope's primary mirror in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At
that time, Hughes Danbury was the optical division of Perkin-Elmer
Corp.
   The company conducted tests that revealed the error, but they
were considered unreliable at the time and disregarded, Allen said.
   The name of the operator who made the mistake was not released.
   The rod, made of the temperature-insensitive metal invar, was
used in a measuring device called a reflective null corrector,
which read the curve of the mirror's surface as it was polished.
The incorrect placement led to a 1.3 millimeter spacing error that
caused the mirror to be made into the wrong shape.
   No one could tell with a naked eye that the rod was upside-down
because it was surrounded by other parts of the null corrector, he
said.
   The flaw, called a spherical aberration, has blurred the view of
the orbiting observatory, which was supposed to take razor-sharp
pictures of outer space.
   It will be corrected during a previously scheduled 1993 space
shuttle mission to replace the Hubble's most powerful instrument,
the wide-field planetary camera, said Charles Pellerin, director of
astrophysics for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Pellerin said it would cost an extra $15 million to correct the
flaw. NASA originally estimated the new camera would cost up to $65
million, he said.
   Allen said many tests could have detected the error during the
manufacturing process, but Perkin-Elmer scientists and engineers
didn't do them because they were pressured to finish the project.
   The pressures, including cost overruns and time constraints,
distracted those working on the mirror, he said. Some tests that
detected the error were considered unreliable at the time, he said.
   ``They could have been trusted. They weren't,'' Allen said.
   But Allen said that did not mean Perkin-Elmer was negligent.
   ``With 20-20 hindsight, one would clearly say there was
negligence ... but you have to take into account the situation that
actually existed,'' he said.
   The investigative team, which visited Hughes Danbury three
times, will issue a final report soon, Allen said.
   NASA's Office of the Inspector General continues to investigate,
Pellerin said.
   The flaw, discovered shortly after Hubble was launched in April,
is one of a series of problems facing the space agency. NASA's
shuttles were grounded because of fuel leaks and its Magellan
spacecraft temporarily ceased communication with earth while
orbiting Venus.
   Because of the Hubble flaw, NASA withheld about $3 million in
so-called ``performance fees'' to Hughes Danbury, Pellerin said.
Performance fees represent a company's profit after NASA has paid
for labor costs.
   NASA's total contract with the company was worth about $450
million and Hughes has received $10 million in performance fees, he
said.

   Japan will provide an additional $3 billion in aid
to international peacekeeping forces in the Persian Gulf and
nations suffering from the U.N.-sponsored embargo against Iraq, the
government announced Friday.
   The Cabinet decision brings Japan's total aid in the gulf crisis
to more than $4 billion. Members of the U.S. Congress had
complained Japan was not doing more in the crisis, and had not
contributed enough in light of its high dependence on Middle East
oil.
   Misoji Sakamoto, the chief government spokesman, said Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu had telephoned President Bush to notify him
of the increase in contribution.
   ``President Bush expressed deep appreciation and told Kaifu that
he will tell his people that Japan is playing an active role in the
international effort in the gulf,'' Sakamoto told reporters.
   Sakamoto said Japan would provide $1 billion to the U.S.-led
forces deployed in the gulf region in the aftermath of Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of oil-rich Kuwait, in addition to $1 billion already
pledged. Together, Iraq and Kuwait possess 20 percent of the
world's oil reserves.
   Another $2 billion would go to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey to help
them overcome setbacks from the economic embargo imposed against
Iraq, he added.
   Of the aid for those frontline states, Sakamoto said Japan would
give $600 million in the first year as an ``exceptional measure to
respond to the emergency situation.''
   He said it would be in the form of a loan at 1 percent annual
interest, repayable in 30 years.
   The additional contribution to the peacekeeping forces was based
on ``the development of the situation in the Middle East and
international efforts of other countries,'' Sakamoto said.
   The 4 billion dollar total figure matched the contribution that
Japanese press reports said the United States was demanding from
Japan.
   Japan pledged Aug. 29 it would provide 1 billion dollars in
non-military aid to the peacekeeping forces. The first shipment of
800 four-wheel-drive vehicles and other equipment already has left
for the Middle East.
   It also announced $22 million to help refugees stranded in the
region.
   Sakamoto said Japan's increased contribution was not in response
to U.S. demands.
   ``This is Japan's contribution to the world based on the United
Nations resolutions. ... We are not only listening to what the
United States says,'' he added.
   Sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum Japan
could provide at this point.
   Sakamoto also reiterated Japan's rejection of efforts by the
U.S. House of Representatives to link Japan's contribution to the
gulf peacekeeping effort with Japanese support for American troops
based here.

<HEAD>OAS Hopes for Early Haitian Election Despite Cost Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States wants
tosend 400 election monitors to Haiti but doesn't have the money,
Secretary-General Joao Clemente Baena Soares said Wednesday.
   His remark at the regular weekly meeting of the OAS permanent
council was regarded as an indirect appeal for the United States to
pay $51 million it owes the organization.
   Baena Soares spoke after a Haitian diplomat told the council
Haitians will begin registering for the election during the first
week in October. But, Ambassador Raymond Joseph said, no date has
been set as yet for the election itself.
   The Haitian said interim President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot has
suggested the election take place in November but said some members
of the Council of State are opposed. The 19-member council has veto
power over the president.
   Baena Soares expressed hope the presidential election,
originally planned early this year, would not be postponed again.
   Haitian President Pascal-Trouillot was offered a U.S. grant of
$3 million for setting up the election when she visited Washington
last May and heard President Bush declare that present chances of a
democratic vote in Haiti ``may be greater (now) than at any time in
its recent history.''
   Mrs. Pascal Trouillot, 43, a widow and one of only a handful of
female judges in Haiti, was a Justice of the Supreme Court when
selected by a coalition of opposition leaders to fill the post
vacated by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril on March 10 amid growing violence
and unrest.
   She said her main task would be to organize an election in order
``to pass power to a democratically elected government chosen with
complete liberty.''

   Assault-style AK-47 rifles are being
manufactured for the first time by an American company that is
getting around the government's ban on imports of the weapon by
producing some new parts.
   But the company's owner and president says he wants to get out
of the business as soon as he recoups the money he lost when the
government cut off imports of the semiautomatic weapons last summer.
   ``There's no money in the firearms manufacturing market,'' said
E. Robert Jensen of Lathrop's Shooters Supply Inc. in Tucson, Ariz.
``I don't need to be in the manufacturing business. When I'm out
seven figures because of an arbitrary action by the government, I'd
like to get it back.''
   Jensen said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had
issued him permits to import several thousand AK-47s from China
before he contracted to buy them. But before they arrived, the
government banned the imports and the Customs Service refused to
release the guns to him, he said.

   Americans, accustomed to watching presidents
and members of Congress on television, will get their first
televised look at federal judges at work next year.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, which sets policy for the federal
courts, approved on Wednesday a carefully controlled and limited
plan to permit TV cameras to record and broadcast civil trials in a
handful of federal courtrooms.
   The three-year experiment will begin in July, limited to two
federal appeals courts and six trial courts. Judges who volunteer
their courtrooms for the plan will have almost total control over
what the public sees.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., who has been urging approval
of the experiment, hailed the Judicial Conference action as a step
toward promoting public understanding of the court system.

   Israeli agents had detailed information about
plans to bomb a U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 but gave
the CIA only a vague warning about the attack in which 241
Americans were killed, a new book claims.
   The allegation is one of many by Victor Ostrovsky, a Canadian
graphic artist who says he served for four years as an operative of
the fabled Israeli spy agency, the Mossad.
   A New York court, at the Israeli government's request, on
Wednesday issued a temporary order barring the publisher, St.
Martin's Press, from distributing the book. The suit said
information in the work could endanger the lives of Israeli agents.
   The 300-page book, ``By Way of Deception: The Making and
Unmaking of a Mossad Officer,'' was written in collaboration with
Canadian journalist Claire Hoy. It purports to name many Mossad
agents and supervisors as it describes in detail Ostrovsky's
three-year training and many of the operations he heard about or in
which he was involved.

   Peru's new president says Washington can keep
the millions in military aid it's offering to step up the war on
cocaine trafficking. He wants cash to get farmers to stop growing
coca and for highway construction so alternate crops can make it to
market.
   Because the aid package ``is destined only for the fight against
drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this agreement,''
President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday night.
   His statement appeared to torpedo any hope his 6-week-old
government will accept the $35.9 million in military aid Washington
is offering this year to fight the cocaine trade.
   Peru could use the money. The country is reeling from the
effects of tough austerity measures aimed at curbing 3,000 percent
annual inflation.

the balance.
   The economy, combined with the competition, is threatening two

   The no-holds-barred New York Post, which has suffered losses for
years, says that the hemorrhaging must end and that it will shut
down with Saturday's edition unless its unions agree to more than
$19 million in concessions.
   At the money-losing Daily News, months-long labor negotiations

<HEAD>Bay Area Band Riding Success of Second Album</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Bay Area-based Tony Toni Tone talks
about a revival, the band's not flashing back to the 1960s, high
times in the Haight, or the Jefferson Airplane.
   These guys were infants in the ``Summer of Love,'' and they
don't play any laid-back hippie music.
   ``What we're talking about on the revival tip is a couple of
things. One is the revival of old sounds, acoustic instruments.
There's too much of machines these days. We wanted to bring the
acoustic sounds back,'' said vocalist Dwayne Wiggins, 23.
   ``And it's the revival of Tony Toni Tone. We controlled
everything on this album: writing, producing. That means a lot to
us.''
   Not surprisingly, the Tonys' second album came to be titled
``Revival.'' It's already revived the sales which brought their
debut LP, ``Who?,'' to the top of the charts; ``Who?'' sold more
than 700,000 copies and had three No. 1 singles on the black charts.
   Their first single off album No. 2, ``The Blues,'' went top five
as well.
   Mighty impressive work by the funky six-piece band, none of whom
are named Tony. They are, instead, guitarist-vocalist Dwayne and
his singing brother, Ray; drummer Timothy Christian; bassist Elijah
Baker; and keyboardists Antron Haile and Carl Wheeler.
   While ``Revival'' is not about the '60s, there's a bit of the
'70s in there. ``Oakland Stroke'' pays homage to Sly Stone, while
``Whatever You Want'' echoes Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. If there's a bit
of the past in this band's current funk, blame on on their
upbringing, says Wiggins.
   ``That wasn't purposely. It's something we inherited, growing up
influenced by certain musicians,'' he said. ``Motown, definitely.
James Brown, Ohio Players _ I like that kind of stuff. Barry White
_ that big bottom sound.''
   The band's name came from a childhood expression among the
members for ``looking good.'' Its biggest break came from a man
with an inherited ear for music: Ed Eckstine, son of the brilliant
Billy Eckstine, who helped the group get a recording contract.
   So how does the son of one of America's most influential jazz
vocalists get an ear for funk?
   ``Ed's real sharp. He's part of the movement,'' said Wiggins,
referring to the new Oakland-San Francisco music scene featuring
M.C. Hammer, En Vogue and Digital Underground.
   ``He knows what's happening, and he's got a real open mind to
all types of music. There's not too many people out there like
him.''
   Along with the music, the Tonys serve up some laughs.
``Revival'' opens with the sound of an old woman sitting quietly in
a rocking chair. She breaks the reverie by asking, ``Is you gonna
record another album?''
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' the Tonys reply.
   ``Is it gonna be anything like the last album?'' she asks.
   ``No, ma'am,'' respond the Tonys.
   ``Oh, well. Let me take off my apron. The boys is back, y'all!''
   Dwayne laughs even now when asked about it.
   ``That's just us joking on the mikes. A lot of the time when we
were joking in the studios, we kept the mikes on, 'cause we had a
lot of tracks to blow,'' Wiggins continued. ``We kept some of the
stuff on the album.''
   Up this fall for the band: a headling tour. An expanded line-up
of Tonys, including a horn section and two back-up singers, will
get out on the road. And more hit singles can be expected; Wiggins
said the group would like to release five more.
   When the tour is done, a third album will follow. Rest assured
it will be done in Oakland, just like the first two.
   ``I've seen other places, traveled and investigated, but I guess
I'm just from Oakland. I've been here my whole life,'' said
Wiggins. ``I'm staying, even with the earthquakes.''
   Wiggins can't resist giving the needle to a caller from New York.
   ``Besides, we got the best baseball team out here. And Rickey
Henderson,'' he said, laughing. Oakland Athletic's outfielder
Rickey Henderson was traded last year by the Yankees to the ``Left
Coast.'' He is the likely Most Valuable Player of the American
League this year.

<HEAD>Dividing Up the House: How It's Done</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virtually every 10 years since this country
was founded the nation has played musical chairs with seats in the
House of Representatives. It's a process that has grown more
complex with time and technology, marked this year by dueling
computers.
   The Census Bureau pioneered the development of modern computers
in its efforts to get Americans counted.
   And today, competing factions use the machines to pick apart
Census results, seeking to squeeze out every bit of advantage to
increase their political and financial standing.
   Americans are counted in every year that ends in a zero to make
sure each state is fairly represented in the House.
   That's because the original compromise that allowed the nation
to get started provided for states' representation to be equal in
the Senate, while power in the House would be based on population.
   Divvying up the House seats sounds like a simple proposition:
divide the number of people by the number of House seats and assign
one seat to each group of that size.
   With 435 seats and a preliminary Census count of 245,837,683 for
1990, that would mean one House member for every 565,144 people.
   Of course, like most things in government, it doesn't work out
that easily.
   To begin with, House seats are assigned to states _ a district
can't be partly in one state and partly in another. That creates a
problem, since the populations of individual states don't always
divide up evenly by 565,144.
   In fact, Wyoming doesn't have nearly that many people.
   It will get a seat in the House anyway. Every state gets one.
   Indeed, the first thing that happens when reapportionment time
comes is that one seat is assigned to each state. It's dividing up
the remaining 385 seats that gets complicated.
   How to do this fairly has perplexed politicians since 1790, when
Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton butted heads over the total
number of seats and what to do when the number of people in the
average district didn't divide evenly into the state population.
   Hamilton's plan prevailed in Congress and President Washington
exercised the nation's first veto. When Congress couldn't override
the veto, it passed Jefferson's plan.
   Officials of small states complained that Jefferson's plan
discriminated against them, and in 1840 a plan devised by Daniel
Webster was used. It awarded an additional seat to any state that
had more than half of a district population left over after all
seats had been divided up.
   While various other methods were used over the years, Congress
avoided taking representatives away from some states and shifting
them to other states by the simple expedient of increasing the size
of the House every 10 years.
   In general, the number of seats was increased to whatever level
was needed so that states that grew could gain seats without other
states losing seats.
   From 1850 to 1900, a plan devised by Samuel F. Vinton of Ohio
was used. But it was abandoned after a mathematical problem was
found called the Alabama Paradox. It was discovered that increasing
the size of the House caused Alabama to lose a seat.
   A more refined system called the Method of Major Fractions was
used in 1910.
   Eventually, it became obvious that the House would one day
become so large as to be unmanageable and in 1913 House membership
was fixed at the current 435 seats.
   But disagreement over the method to be used prevented any
redistricting after the 1920 Census.
   The Method of Equal Proportions was adopted in 1930 and is still
used.
   That means today, when any state adds people and gains a new
seat, some other state has to lose one.
   Here's how it works:
   A set of priority values is developed for each of the 385
remaining seats, and those values are multiplied by each state's
population.
   That gives population-leading California the highest priority
for the next available seat, followed by New York and so forth.
   This year it looks like California will wind up with 52 seats,
New York with 31 and so on, down to Wyoming, Alaska, Delaware,
Montana, North and South Dakota and Vermont, whose populations are
so small that all 385 seats are gone before they get a second one.
   Assigning the seats to states becomes a fairly straightforward
task when the formula and populations have been programmed into
computers.
   It gets tougher afterward, though, as politicians and their
consultants try to draw lines within the states to organize those
seats. Each side tries to improve the chances of getting candidates
from his or her party elected without being so obvious about it
that a court throws the plan out.
   That will occupy state legislators and their computers for much
of 1991.

<HEAD>Graham Kerr Back on TV 19 Years After `Galloping Gourmet'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Picture, if you can, the Galloping
Gourmet gone so spartan in the kitchen that his own family quit
speaking to him over dinner.
   That was a low point in the culinary and spiritual odyssey that
has led Graham Kerr back to television 19 years after the wildly
successful series that made him famous.
   Along the way, a traffic accident nearly killed him and his
wife, Treena, they spent two years sailing around the world with
their children, they spurned TV and gave away their possessions in
favor of aid to the poor and church work as born-again Christians,
and Treena overcame alcohol and Valium addiction and survived a
heart attack.
   Now, vowing never again to preach the ``rampant legalism'' that
once banished pleasure from his kitchen, Kerr (rhymes with hair) is
returning with a show under his own name, starting Monday on nearly
100 TV stations nationwide.
   ``We are the only show, I believe, that puts its food out to
test in the audience on the show itself,'' he said.
   Judging by three of the 44 episodes produced by Treena at
Seattle's KING Television, Kerr and his slimmed-down preparations
pass the test handily.
   Gone are the long sideburns, omnipresent wine glass and classic
concoctions oozing calories and cholesterol the Galloping Gourmet
brought to households worldwide.
   Exuberant as ever at age 56, he now seeks to ``create a cloud of
aroma and color and texture, and then steal into that cloud and
steal away the fat and salt and sugar.''
   His recipes are analyzed down to the fat level of lemon (9.31
percent) and the salt count of celery (4 milligrams per stalk) by a
$7,000 computer and software from the University of Minnesota
School of Public Health.
   When a recipe calls for wine, it's a wine without alcohol.
   ``I'm trying to provide a creative alternative for people who
say, `I don't want to drink wine and drive home,' '' he said.
   He figures he spends about 11 hours converting a dish like
quiche Lorraine into a healthier and _ he hopes _ even more tasty
alternative for each half-hour show.
   Rice and parmesan cheese replace the rich quiche crust, one egg
is used rather than three, and the amount of ham is cut from six
ounces to two in favor of mushrooms, bell peppers, sun-dried
tomatoes and ``lots of thyme and basil,'' he said.
   ``We are very clear: This quiche is not a quiche Lorraine,'' he
said. ``Quiche (Lorraine) is absolutely deadly. Real men don't eat
quiche because real men want to live beyond their 14th birthday.''
   ``You'll find butter and beef, cream and eggs in my dishes, but
they will all be pegged down about two-thirds,'' he said.
   A native of London, Kerr was born to well-established hotel
operators and trained from age 15. He held the rank of captain and
served as catering adviser during a five-year stint in the British
army.
   In 1958, Kerr moved to New Zealand, where he was named chief
catering advisor for the Royal New Zealand Air Force.
   At the order of his senior officer, he began appearing on TV. He
left the service, launched a cooking show in Australia and moved to
Canada, where he hit the big time with 440 episodes of ``The
Galloping Gourmet'' from 1969 to 1971.
   Witty, amusing and sometimes outrageous, Kerr eventually reached
200 million viewers around the world each week. He sold $4 million
worth of books, including the ``Galloping Gourmet TV'' series,
``The Graham Kerr Cookbook'' and ``The Complete Galloping Gourmet
Cookbook.''
   As producer, Treena won two Emmy nominations.
   Then a vegetable truck piled into their on-location vehicle
outside San Francisco. While they recuperated, the family sailed
more than 24,000 miles aboard a 71-foot sailboat.
   Their personal life disintegrated. Treena was hooked on Valium
and two of his three children on alcohol and drugs. The success of
a four-minute show, ``Take Kerr,'' grew increasingly hollow and he
abandoned it.
   That was when their maid converted the couple to the Pentecostal
faith. Over the next decade, the Kerrs lived in Colorado, Hawaii
and Oregon, working in Christian outreach programs, then settled in
Tacoma, Wash., in 1981.
   Always the primary cook at home, Kerr went from reveling in each
new taste sensation to banning one food after another from the
household.
   ``Salami, chocolate ... even bran cereal, when I found out it
was about 40 percent sugar. My poor family suffered,'' he said. ``I
mean, can you imagine, I was preaching to a 7-year-old child about
colon cancer.''
   ``It was horrible,'' Treena said. ``The kids would whisper about
sneaking out to McDonald's.''
   Finally, the family stopped talking to him at the table.
   ``That got to me,'' he said, ``so I started to build back the
enjoyment factor in my family (cooking), and my family started
talking to me again.''
   The final ingredient of Kerr's culinary rebirth was Treena's
1986 heart attack, adding a personal incentive to wring as much
fat, salt and sugar out of his recipes as possible.
   ``Eating is a celebration,'' he said. ``We've got it with bells
on. Why don't we enjoy it to the max, but without risk?''

   THE THINNEST BLUE LINE: ``Blue Helmets: The History of United
Nations Peacekeeping,'' a 90-minute documentary airing tonight on
PBS, examines the noble aspirations and sometimes rocky history of
U.N. peacekeeping efforts.
   The program, narrated by Jesse Jackson, chronicles the U.N.
forces' historic role as buffer between adversaries in the Congo,
Cyprus and Namibia, as well as in the Middle East.
   U.N. forces, distinctive in their blue helmets, historically
have operated with restrictions on the use of their weapons. ``All
you've got really is the kindness in your eyes and the tone of your
voice,'' as one puts it.

   Leopold Stokowski's hands carve the air,
yellow and pink lights illuminating his every move as he brings
Bach's ``Toccata and Fugue in D Minor'' to visual life.
   Soon, he and the orchestra disappear, replaced by clouds,
abstract lines, shifting shapes and beams of light. It is
``absolute music,'' we are told in the opening moments of Walt
Disney's animated tribute to classical music, ``Fantasia.''
   And this autumn, Stokowski will once again shake hands with
Mickey Mouse as a restored version of the 1940 classic plays on
movie screens throughout the United States.
   The film, two years in restoration, will have its gala premiere
Sept. 21 in Philadelphia as a benefit for The Curtis Institute of
Music, a tuition-free conservatory for exceptionally gifted young
musicians. Already showing in Europe, the film is scheduled for
general release in the United States on Oct. 5.
   ``Fantasia'' was revolutionary when it appeared, and today
remains a landmark blend of cinema and music, largely because of
the collaboration of Disney and Stokowski, the legendary conductor
of The Philadelphia Orchestra.
   Disney had tinkered with synchronization of cartoons and music
as early as 1929 in ``The Skeleton Dance,'' the first of his more
than 70 ``Silly Symphonies.''
   He first approached Stokowski with the idea of recording Dukas'
``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' and animating it. The plan grew into
a concert of eight classical works narrated by Deems Taylor, a
popular composer and radio broadcaster.
   The animated vignettes begin with abstract designs swaying to
Bach, and shift to fireflies, mushrooms, flowers, fish and thistles
in Tchaikovsky's ``The Nutcracker Suite.''
   Mickey puts on his master's cap and instructs brooms to carry
water, then loses control of them in ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.''
Moments after the vignette, Mickey's silhouette shakes hands with
Stokowski at the podium.
   Dinosaurs act out the origin of the Earth to the strains of
Stravinsky's ``The Rite of Spring.''
   Fauns, centaurs and a drunken Bacchus populate Mount Olympus in
Beethoven's ``Pastoral Symphony.'' A tutu-clad hippopotamus is the
star of Ponchielli's ``Dance of the Hours,'' performing a graceful
_ and funny _ pas de deux with a crocodile. The vignette includes
other dancing hippos, crocodiles, elephants and ostriches.
   Evil and the profane meet the forces of goodness and light in
Mussorgsky's ``Night on Bald Mountain,'' and Schubert's ``Ave
Maria'' ends the film on a pious note, as a processional is
reflected in a pool of water.
   The original soundtrack was recorded in April 1939 by The
Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski at the Academy of Music.
Nearly half the orchestra's members are graduates of The Curtis
Institute, and The Walt Disney Co. thought Philadelphia would be
the appropriate city in which to have the first showing of the
restored version.
   To restore the film, Disney used modern film stock and improved
lenses to extract more detail and color from the original nitrate
negative than seen in versions released a half century ago.
   In a version of ``Fantasia'' shown in theaters in 1982 and 1985,
the soundtrack was by studio musicians. The new version not only
restores the Philadelphia Orchestra, but recreates Stokowski's
vision for a ``Fantasound'' soundtrack that distributed sound
throughout the theater in the days before stereo and digital sound.
   The film originally traveled with a complex system of up to 135
speakers to which the sound had to be switched manually. It later
showed in theaters with a simpler, mono soundtrack.
   The music, however, was never uniformly popular with critics,
many of whom considered Stokowski's treatment of Beethoven and Bach
as verging on sacrilege. Some of Disney's caricatures have been
criticized for being overly cute, and the only black animated
characters are servants for Bacchus.
   But Stokowski saw the film as a pioneering development.
   ``We who with Walt Disney made `Fantasia' think of it not as
perfect or final, but as the beginning of a new art form,'' he
wrote in 1940.
   ``Our aim was to make use of all the most recent scientific
developments in recording and reproducing music, methods that
seemed to us helpful in making music more eloquent, and so be of
greater service to all those who enjoy music.''
   Much of the effort was to make the music flow around moviegoers
as if they were in a forest listening to birds all around them
instead of in a theater, Stokowski wrote.
   ``What people will be hearing probably hasn't been heard since
1941, the actual `Fantasound,' the way it was intended to be
heard,'' said Terry Porter, who headed the sound restoration for
Disney. ``It's quite dynamic, even by today's standard of films.''
   He used Stokowski's handwritten notes, old blueprints and 1940s
journals to direct the music through modern theater sound systems.
He estimated 3,000 pops and hisses were removed from the soundtrack.
   ``We really tried to keep the music to its original integrity,''
he said. ``We didn't want to mess with the original sound. If in
removing a pop we would hurt the sound, we left the pop in.''
   Similar care was taken to adhere to the original visual images
in restoration, said Pete Comandini, vice president of engineering
for Y.C.M. Laboratories, which did the work under the direction of
Disney's Leon Briggs.
   Original negatives were rescued from Disney vaults for all but
about 15 minutes of the film, Comandini said.
   Each frame was individually examined and cleaned. ``This dirt,
being on there for 50 years, some of it was quite stubborn and had
to be cleaned by razor blade,'' he said.
   The restorers' mandate was to make no modifications. ``It was a
big jigsaw puzzle putting everything together, making sure
everything fit to the exact frame as it originally was,'' Comandini
said.
   Finally, the color was balanced and approved by the studio.
   ``The picture is quite a bit sharper,'' he said. ``The colors
are quite nice and rich and saturated. There's a lot of detail in
there that's subtle and probably hasn't been seen since it was
released.''
   The Curtis Institute hopes to raise $100,000 from the benefit
screening of ``Fantasia,'' to be used toward a three-year $5.2
million fund drive, said James McClelland, Curtis' development
director.
   The institute was founded in 1924 by Mary Louise Curtis Bok in
memory of her father, Cyrus H.K. Curtis, founder of Curtis
Publishing Co. The school counts conductor Leonard Bernstein,
composer Samuel Barber and pianist Peter Serkin among its graduates.
   This fall, 164 students from the United States and 13 foreign
countries are expected to study with the school's 76-member
faculty. The institute is tuition free, so students are admitted
based on their musical talents.

<HEAD>Secret Industry Helps Make Food Palatable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY KINNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From high-tech chicken pot pies to powdered
soft drinks, a super-secret world is at work on much of our food.
   The flavor industry replaces the savor we destroy, making a TV
dinner taste less like cardboard.
   ``In processing food to get it into the form people want or to
make it safe, flavor is processed out,'' said Bob Pellegrino,
general manager at Cincinnati-based Fries &amp; Fries, one of the
nation's largest flavor producers.
   Grandma went to her garden or market for fresh produce hours
before preparing and serving it. But we've come to expect food to
wait months in warehouses and on store shelves, before it's popped
into a microwave oven to be ready to eat in seconds _ and to still
taste as good as grandma's.
   To a surprising degree, it does, thanks to flavorists who have
created an estimated $750 million-a-year industry that helps make
the food we eat palatable.
   Flavorists usually are chemists who have spent several years
learning to identify and duplicate natural flavors. Many say then
can discern thousands of flavors, nuances such as the difference
between the part of an apple near the skin and the part near the
core.
   The flavorist's challenge is to restore natural flavors, no
matter what modern processing, packaging, storage and cooking have
done to them.
   America's changing lifestyle means that food processors have to
compensate for flavor that used to be provided by animal fats,
cream and other high-cholesterol foods that don't fit into our
diet-conscious lives.
   ``There are a few words that are driving our industry _ light,
or low-fat; natural; and convenient,'' Pellegrino said.
   Flavoring agents are pervasive. Dairy products, bakery goods,
desserts and beverages of all kinds are laced with flavorings. Just
about every package in your pantry lists flavoring as an ingredient.
   Because ingredients are listed in descending order by weight,
flavoring is last because it comprises less than one-half of 1
percent of the weight of the product _ sometimes just a few parts
per million.
   ``That means 100 pounds of flavoring makes more than 20,000
pounds of product,'' Pellegrino said. Liquid flavoring rolls out of
his plant in 55-gallon drums and powders in 10,000-pound lots.
   The flavor-making industry is secretive and clannish, Pellegrino
said. A food company that markets its brand has a proprietary
interest in the way its pot pie, pudding or potato chip tastes and
doesn't want anybody else to produce that flavor.
   ``There's a high level of trust between the flavor company and
the food and beverage company,'' Pellegrino said. ``Service and
confidentiality are important. We'd be out of business pretty
quickly if we said we were flavoring this or flavoring that.''
   He refuses to identify any brand that uses his products. But he
says Fries &amp; Fries and a competitor, International Flavors and
Fragrances Inc., are among the nation's largest, each handling
about 10 percent of the industry's business, or upward of $50
million a year.
   There are about 100 flavor companies in the United States, and
about 80 of them belong to the Washington, D.C.-based Flavor and
Extract Manufacturers Association, said Earl Klinger, the group's
administrator.
   The association refuses to acknowledge any ranking among the
industry's companies or the volume of the business.
   ``We really do not know for certain,'' Klinger said. ``It's not
legally possible to patent, copyright or otherwise protect a
formula for a flavor, so the only way one company can maintain a
competitive advantage is to keep it a secret.
   ``I've heard all sorts of figures, and we really have no way of
knowing.''
   Flavorists like to say they can reproduce a flavor from taste
the way some musicians play songs by ear. In practice, they usually
start by analyzing the chemical content of a food by using a gas
chromatograph and listing the ingredients.
   Then they recreate flavors in the laboratory, altering them any
way they choose by, for example, making a fruit drink taste riper,
sweeter or more tart.
   There might be 500 components in any flavor, and it is the
distinctive formulation of those components that makes one brand of
soft drink taste different from another brand.
   ``This is very much a self-policed industry, although we work in
partnership with the Food and Drug Administration,'' Pellegrino
said.
   Flavoring ingredients come from the FDA's ``Generally Recognized
As Safe'' list, and many flavors are recreated from chemicals that
occur naturally to produce the flavor being enhanced, he said.
   Ruth Weisheit, supervisor of consumer affairs at the FDA's
Cincinnati office, said flavorings are regulated as food additives.
``Any new flavorings or new uses of a flavoring agent would require
FDA testing to make sure it is safe.''
   Under the 1938 food labeling act, artificial flavorings can be
listed as flavoring without identifying individual ingredients, Ms.
Weisheit said.
   ``One of the reasonings . . . is that a flavoring agent can
contain literally hundreds of ingredients, and it would be almost
impossible to have a label large enough to list all of them,'' she
said.
   Not all flavorings are used in food, Ms. Weisheit noted. They
are in cough syrups, lipstick, mouthwash and drug products.
   Flavorings are widely used throughout the beverage industry,
from soft drinks and powdered mixes to liqueurs such as peach
schnapps and apricot brandy.
   A bigger challenge is making flavor additives that stand up to
processing, especially microwave cooking, which tends to distort
traditional flavors, especially in meat and bakery products.
   ``When you bake a cake, a lot of the flavor comes from the
baking process, and you just don't get that from a microwave,''
Pellegrino said. There is no char-broiled flavor in a microwaved
hamburger, without a flavor assist.
   Sometimes, a laboratory-created flavor that's good for one item
is bad for another because of the way texture, aroma and flavor are
affected by cooking or the preservatives necessary to prolong
shelf-life.
   ``In beverages, you don't want the flavor to linger, but you do
want it in low-fat ice cream,'' Pellegrino said.

   As Idaho's famous potato enters the 21st
century, it may be dressed with something more than the same old
sour cream and chives _ a new genetic identity.
   Scientists at the University of Idaho's Aberdeen Research and
Extension Center are taking the first steps toward weaving new
genes into the potato's molecular tapestry.
   Their super spud would have enhanced consumer appeal, increased
grower profitability and reduced environmental impact.
   ``The potato is going to change. It's changing now,'' said Bill
Belknap, a plant physiologist with the USDA's Agricultural Research
Service.
   The tuber of the future will be rugged. It will ward off viruses
and bruises, withstand drought and even carry natural toxins to
kill the insects used to feasting on it.
   ``We're trying to alter the genetic makeup and still make it
normal in all other respects,'' said Dennis Corsini, a research
plant pathologist in Aberdeen. ``It's all designed to produce a
crop more efficiently.''
   The idea of genetically altered food may make consumers leery.
But done successfully, it could put the potatoes currently lost to
insects and disease on the dinner table.
   Although genetic alterations are fairly new for Idaho's No. 1
crop, they have been conducted for some time on plants like
tomatoes or tobacco. Because the commercial end of the spud, the
tuber, is produced on an annual cycle, the researchers have only
one chance each year to transform and then review it.
   ``It's terrifying,'' Belknap said. ``Spring comes whether you're
ready or not. . . . You only get one shot per year.''
   Belknap and colleagues _ ``gene jockeys,'' he calls them _ have
added two additional ``marker'' genes this year to several
varieties of potatoes. One resists a certain drug and the other
contains a specific enzyme. They will not change the potato as much
as show a genetic change has taken place.
   Belknap applies agro-bacteria containing the genetic signal to
the host potato's tissue. The bacteria create a ``disorganized
tissue,'' or gall, as the new genes meld with the plant's molecular
DNA ladder.
   ``The genes it puts in are so cute, you wouldn't believe it,''
Belknap said. ``It's how Mother Nature does it.''
   If the initial experiments turn out well this year, Corsini and
research geneticist Joe Pavek will cross the altered plants, called
``constructs,'' with standard varieties like Aberdeen's Lemhi
Russet in 1991.
   Then the new hybrids will be tested for quality and yield
characteristics. Researchers will then start tinkering to improve
their stamina in the field and storage bin.
   One identified gene could make the potatoes resistant to black
spots, those ugly bruises beneath the skin. Other genes would fight
soft rot or leafroll virus. Potatoes could even be designed to
accommodate the droughts plaguing the West.
   Yet another gene would create a toxin fatal to the Colorado
potato beetle. Coast producers now spray their fields five times a
year to combat it, Corsini said.
   Other potato problems are harder to eradicate, Belknap said. It
would require an extensive genetic overhaul to prevent ``sugar
end,'' or the migration of carbohydrates to one end of the tuber.
French fry producers reject those potatoes because the sugar turns
dark brown when it hits the cooking oil.
   But success could mean the demise of Idaho's world-renowned
baker _ the Russet Burbank that makes up 40 percent of the potato
acreage in the country. It is pollen-sterile and cannot be used as
a parent plant, so it probably will not be genetically crossed, and
someday a potato boasting super genes could take its place on top
of the heap.
   The Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service oversees the tests and requires a long paper trail of
applications before permits are granted.

<HEAD>Profs Say Hebrews Beat Columbus to America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two professors say carbon dating of wood
fragments and other evidence found a century ago in an ancient tomb
in Tennessee prove Hebrews sailed to America centuries before
Columbus.
   But the professors are having little success convincing other
scholars.
   Cyrus Gordon, a former Dartmouth College professor of Judaic
culture, proposed the theory in 1971 after studying inscriptions on
a stone from the tomb.
   He believes the words are Old Hebrew for ``strong'' or
``strength'' and ``for Judea.'' Based on the way the letters are
drawn, Gordon, an expert on epigraphy, the study of old writings,
figures they had to be inscribed around A.D. 100.
   ``The . . . inscription is important because it is the first
scientifically authenticated pre-Columbian text in an Old World
script or language found in America,'' he wrote in a paper
describing the finding. ``It proves that some Old World people not
only could, but actually did, cross the Atlantic to America before
the Vikings and Columbus.''
   Frank Cross, a Semitic languages professor at Harvard
University, is among the skeptics.
   The inscriptions, he said, ``don't fit any Paleo-Hebrew script
that I know. Most of the signs are unrelated. A few have
superficial similarities, but they don't go together for that
period.''
   ``Cyrus Gordon is the only scholar in the field of epigraphy
that I know of who has taken the stuff seriously,'' he said.
   Gordon, of Brookline, Mass., stands by his findings.
   ``For any rational person to deny these facts, they have to deny
not only the evidence of the inscriptions, they have to deny all
the rules of scientific dating,'' he said.
   Gordon said brass bracelets from the tomb support his theory.
They contain a zinc-copper alloy used by the Romans from A.D. 45 to
200, he said.
   Gordon said that for years, he talked little about his theory
because he had no way to prove the artifacts were as old as he
believed. He wanted to have the wood fragments carbon-dated, but
the process wasn't advanced enough to work on such a small amount
of wood.
   In 1979, with the advent of better testing methods, J. Huston
McCulloch of Ohio State University began pestering the Smithsonian
Institution, which had the artifacts, to have the wood carbon-dated.
   Finally, in 1988, McCulloch, an economics professor with an
interest in epigraphy, got the Institute for the Study of American
Cultures in Columbus, Ga., to pay for the dating.
   It established that the wood dated to somewhere between A.D. 32
and 769. Columbus sailed to the New World in 1492, while the
Vikings landed in Newfoundland, Canada, sometime around 1000.
   McCulloch and Gordon theorize that Hebrew sailors were trying to
escape Roman repression after one of two rebellions, the first
ending in A.D. 73, the second in 135.
   Gordon believes the sailors landed in the southeastern United
States, were forced inland because the coast was settled by
American Indians and got as far as Loudon County, in eastern
Tennessee, about 30 miles southwest of present-day Knoxville.
   The Bat Creek tomb was unearthed in 1889. It contained nine
skeletons with the heads of all but one pointing north. Under the
skull and jawbone of the south-pointing skeleton were several
objects, including the inscribed stone.
   Gordon theorized the south-pointing skeleton was the leader of
the settlement. McCulloch said the wood fragments probably were
part of an earspool worn by the leader.
   Cyrus Thomas, who headed the Smithsonian team that unearthed the
tomb, believed the stone inscriptions were done by Cherokee
Indians. But Gordon said the shape of the lettering isn't
consistent with Cherokee inscriptions.
   McCulloch published the carbon-dating results in the journal
Tennessee Anthropologist, but they attracted little attention.
   ``There's been kind of a stony silence,'' he said. ``It's sort
of been ignored.''
   Mike Shoemaker, assistant editor of Biblical Archaeology Review
in Washington, D.C., isn't surprised. Though he considers the Bat
Creek findings the ``best example of pre-Columbian contact'' in
America, Gordon's and McCulloch's work has been ignored because it
runs contrary to accepted theories, Shoemaker said.
   ``It's mostly ignored because it's so controversial,'' he said.
``The prejudice about the idea that anyone came before Columbus is
so enormous it's practically impossible to overcome.''

<TEXT>
   At 21,000-plus feet on Mount Everest,
Courtney Skinner knew he was in trouble. Every breath he drew was
painful, as if he had a crushed chest.
   The Pinedale, Wyo., outfitter knew his only chance was to
breathe in large amounts of oxygen quickly to counter the liquid
that nearly filled his lungs, a symptom of acute mountain sickness.
   ``I was very critical,'' he said. ``Under my own motivation, I
had no more power.''
   Skinner, a member of the 1988 Cowboys on Everest expedition,
became one of the first mountain climbers to test the Gamow Bag, a
pressurized bag resembling a human-size cigar tube that combats the
effects of illnesses such as acute mountain and decompression
sicknesses.
   After 11 hours of inhaling oxygen in the bag, Skinner emerged
with his lungs 90 percent clear, and he was able to resume his
ascent. His alternative would have been abandoning the expedition
and being carried to a lower altitude for lifesaving oxygen
treatments.
   High-altitude illnesses, such as acute cerebral edema and acute
pulmonary edema, are caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. Early
symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness and
nausea. In later stages, the sometimes-fatal illnesses cause fluid
to fill the lungs or the brain.
   Mountain climbers long have known that the cure for
high-altitude sicknesses is descent _ the lower the altitude, the
more abundant the oxygen. But descent isn't always possible,
particularly for climbers who are too ill to move, or if the
weather is bad.
   The Gamow Bag gives the effect of lowering altitude 1{ miles by
pumping fresh air into the pressurized chamber. Zipped inside the
bag, climbers fill their lungs with much-needed oxygen.
   ``When the pressure started, you could almost feel a warmth or a
glow come over you,'' recalled Skinner. ``You were more
comfortable, you weren't fighting for each breath.''
   The bright red-and-yellow bag has been credited with saving
about a dozen critically ill mountain climbers in the past three
years, says its inventor, Igor Gamow, a professor at the University
of Colorado.
   Now, he's looking at ways of using the bag to aid balloonists
and pilots and even scuba divers suffering from decompression
sickness.
   Gamow, who has a doctorate in biophysics and microbiology,
recalled that a suggestion from Gary Ruggera, a former student, led
to the development of the bag.
   ``He said, `Igor, if athletes can gain from the benefits . . .
just think what would happen to mountain climbers,' '' Gamow
recalled.
   At the time, Gamow was conducting high-altitude training tests
on athletes who worked out on equipment inside an 8-foot
pressurized bubble chamber. He fitted that technology into the
portable bag, which weighs about 10 pounds.
   The spring of 1987 found Gamow stitching a length of
polyurethane nylon on a sewing machine. ``It would take maybe two
hours' sewing and 10 hours on your hands and knees sealing it with
all sorts of sticky goop,'' he recalled.
   The first ``goop'' they used was a glue for repairing tennis
shoes. Today, the bag, which is marketed by DuPont Corp., is sealed
with a heat-seal process. It sells for $3,000.
   Ian D. Schokking, a volunteer physician at the Kunde Hospital in
the 13,000-foot Sagamatha National Park in Nepal, wrote to Gamow
this spring that the bag has saved the lives of at least two
patients.
   ``Our location, and the expense of oxygen, makes your Gamow Bag
the perfect technology for treating altitude illness within our
treatment area, which extends two days' walk in four directions,''
Schokking wrote.
   After spending most of his life in research, Gamow is delighted
with the turn his career has taken. He's traveled the world on
behalf of his bag and makes annual educational trips to Nepal.

<HEAD>Tot Born Deaf Is Learning To Hear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old born deaf is learning to use an
electronic device implanted in his ear to transmit sound and help
him hear.
   Each time Bradley Drymon indicates he's heard a sound emitted
from his therapist's computer, he thumps a blue box in front of him
and a small, colorful ball of cereal rolls down a chute.
   He pops it into his mouth and waits for the next sound _ a beep.
   On June 28, the Sarasota tot had a tiny sound-transmitting
electrode inserted into his ear canal during surgery at Tampa
General Hospital. The surgery came one day after the Food and Drug
Administration declared the procedure safe for children.
   The electrode, called a cochlear implant, replaces the natural
sound-transmitting connection between the ear and the hearing
nerve. The child didn't have that connection.
   After his incision healed, the three-part device had to be
hooked up. He just started learning to use his electronic ear with
the help of two audio therapists at the University of South Florida.
   ``It's going much better than expected,'' said Holly Skinner, a
specialist who uses sign language to communicate with Bradley. She
also dispenses the cereal.
   When Bradley first heard a beep, it was ``pretty traumatic,''
she said.
   ``He started crying and trying to rip off his head. We couldn't
get him back in the room for an hour,'' Ms. Skinner said.
   The therapists work to tune the device so it will receive the
volume and pitch the boy can hear. By watching his reactions, they
determine the softest volume he can hear and the loudest he can
stand.
   The 1{-inch wire winding in his ear has 22 electrodes, each of
which picks up a variety of pitches and volumes.
   ``Every once in a while, his eyes will light up, and you'll know
he's heard something,'' said his mother, Sylvia Drymon. ``He even
picks up the beat on the radio.''

<HEAD>Study Challenges Theory of Fifth, Sixth Forces of Nature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The theory that more than four
fundamental forces govern the universe is under attack again, this
time from physicists who measured gravity inside holes drilled for
nuclear weapons tests.
   The new study was published in the Sept. 3 issue of the journal
Physical Review Letters by J. Thomas of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, and Peter Vogel of the California Institute of
Technology.
   Physicists long believed there were four basic forces of nature:
gravity; electromagnetism, which creates light, electricity, radio
waves and microwaves; the strong force, which holds the centers of
atoms together; and the weak force, which lets some atoms decay
radioactively.
   But starting in 1985, a series of experiments raised the
possibility there might be a fifth force, which slightly
counteracts gravity, and a sixth force, which boosts gravity
slightly.
   Those experiments were based on gravity measurements made inside
a mine shaft, on a television tower, at the base of a cliff and in
other locations. All the experiments found the strength of gravity
differed slightly from what was predicted by Sir Isaac Newton's
300-year-old law of gravity.
   That law says the gravitational attraction between two objects
decreases with the square of the distance between them.
   Thomas and Vogel analyzed gravity measurements made inside
10-foot-wide boreholes that extend down as much as 2{ miles at the
Nevada Test Site, where U.S. nuclear warheads are detonated in
underground tests.
   They found the strength of gravity at various depths in the
holes also differed from what Newton's law predicted. While that
might be interpreted as evidence for additional forces of nature,
Thomas and Vogel came up with a much less exotic explanation: The
measurements were flawed by variations in the density of rock
surrounding the holes.
   Earlier experiments claiming to support existence of fifth and
sixth forces of nature also are likely flawed by the same problem,
they wrote.
   In 1988, a similar argument was made after gravity was measured
inside drillholes in Greenland's ice sheet.

<HEAD>More Evidence That Los Angeles Air Pollution Travels Far</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An industrial pollutant dumped into the Los
Angeles Basin's smoggy air shows up one to two days later in Nevada
and Arizona, a study says.
   Scientists traced the summertime movement of methylchloroform,
an industrial solvent that helps deplete Earth's protective ozone
layer and also contributes to global warming caused by the
``greenhouse effect.''
   The chemical isn't produced by any natural source, allowing
researchers to use it as an indicator of the path followed by
manmade pollutants.
   They monitored levels of methylchloroform at Claremont in the
Los Angeles Basin; at Cajon Pass, in the mountains above the basin;
and at Spirit Mountain, Nev., and Meadview, Ariz., which are 185
miles and 250 miles northeast of the basin.
   The researchers found high methylchloroform levels in the Los
Angeles Basin on weekdays, but low levels on weekends, when most
industries that use it are closed.
   At the Nevada and Arizona sites, methylchloroform levels were
highest Wednesday to Sunday, then lowest on Monday and Tuesday _
indicating a one- to two-day lag for wind to carry the pollutant
from of the Los Angeles Basin.
   The study was conducted by Warren H. White and Edward Macias of
Washington University in St. Louis; David Miller, David Schorran
and Thomas Hoffer of the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev.;
and David P. Rogers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in
La Jolla, Calif.
   It was published in the July issue of the journal Geophysical
Research Letters.

<HEAD>Study Disputes Notion Volcanic Greenhouse Killed the Dinosaurs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New research casts doubt on a theory that blames
extinction of the dinosaurs on global warming caused by huge
volcanic eruptions in what is now India.
   The study is part of the long-running debate on whether the
demise of the dinosaurs and many other species about 66 million
years ago was caused by an asteroid or comet striking Earth, by
massive volcanic eruptions or by gradual climate change.
   Many supporters of the first two theories believe that either an
asteroid or comet impact or large-scale eruptions could have kicked
enough smoke and debris skyward to block out sunlight, plunging the
Earth into a time of deadly cold.
   However, some volcano theory advocates argue that massive
eruptions of basalt lava at India's Deccan Traps 66 million years
ago could have emitted enough carbon dioxide to cause a
``greenhouse effect,'' trapping solar heat and making the climate
too hot for dinosaurs and many other creatures.
   That theory was tested by Ken Caldeira of New York University's
Earth systems group and Michael Rampino, who works for NYU and for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   They calculated the Deccan Traps eruptions _ similar to the
floods of lava that produced the Pacific Northwest's Columbia River
basalts _ couldn't have spewed out enough carbon dioxide to cause
global warming and mass extinctions.
   The eruptions, occurring over several hundred thousand years,
would have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
by less than 75 parts per million, enough to raise global
temperatures by less than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, Caldeira and
Rampino estimated.
   ``This suggests that the . . . extinctions were not caused by
drastic greenhouse warming resulting from carbon dioxide released
during Deccan volcanism,'' they wrote in the August issue of
Geophysical Research Letters.

<HEAD>Bush's Wish for More Oil Wells Might Get No Quick Response</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies that do most of the country's oil
exploration say oil well investors need better tax incentives to
meet President Bush's call for more production, but
environmentalists are ready to fight any favors for the industry.
   Smaller oil companies, which do most of the exploratory
drilling, say current taxes discourage investment in oil wells. But
environmentalists who think conservation is the way to break
America's dependence on foreign oil say they will oppose breaks for
oil companies, particularly an opening of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for drilling.
   ``It's clear that Bush cannot understand what conservation
means. He still thinks it means freezing in the dark,'' said Dru
Schmidt-Perkins, conservation analyst for the Energy Conservation
Coalition in Washington.
   She was responding Wednesday to Bush's call for more oil
production in a televised speech to Congress the night before. The
president asked lawmakers to speed the development of oil reserves
in Alaska and increase incentives for oil and gas exploration.
   The American Petroleum Institute said Bush's comments echoed
some of what the industry has been asking for, but that doesn't
mean Congress will go along.
   ``In general, he was saying what we would like to hear, because
our industry is in the doldrums,'' said James Merna, spokesman for
the Independent Petroleum Association of America. ``But he just
didn't come up with the specifics.''
   Environmental groups did not wait for specifics to blast Bush
for indicating that oil companies should be allowed into the Arctic
refuge, which is believed to contain the nation's largest untapped,
on-shore reserve of crude oil.
   Ms. Schmidt-Perkins said Bush has a blind spot when it comes to
conservation measures that would make more sense in the long run,
such as requiring all cars to be made with greater fuel efficiency.
Bush has opposed such a measure, and his calls for energy
conservation have not been backed up with any concrete proposals
for saving fuel, his critics point out.
   The Energy Department, expected to announce a new long-term
energy plan toward the end of the year, reportedly has an
inter-agency task force examining ways to boost development of
renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and biomass.
   But Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said there was no indication from
the president's speech that the administration was putting much
emphasis in those areas.
   ``Never once did he mention renewable energy,'' Harkin said.
   The oil industry says more exploration is part of the answer to
reducing America's addiction to overseas crude. But despite the
rapid rise in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2, and the subsequent boycott of their oil, there has been no
rush to find more oil.
   ``We'll have to look at prices today, plus what is a reasonable
outlook for prices in two to five years and even longer,'' said
Michael E. Thompson, a spokesman for Amoco Corp. ``Many of these
projects are five- or 10- or 20-year projects.''
   Major oil companies have not even been able to see yet what the
Persian Gulf crisis will do to their earnings in the short run, he
said.
   Smaller, independent oil companies drill about 85 percent of the
nation's wells, according to IPAA, which represents smaller
companies. Its members could use some tax breaks to get out of the
economic slump that set in when the price of oil collapsed in the
mid 1980s.
   Independent oil operators used to borrow cash for drilling, but
many of the companies and the banks that loaned them money have now
gone under, said Lloyd N. Unsell, acting president of IPAA. The
number of independent producers has fallen from about 13,000 to
4,500 since the bust, and Unsell said tax incentives might be
necessary before investors will decide to pump money into oil deals.

<TEXT>
   The son of a man who went on a shooting
spree last year filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the makers of
Prozac, saying the anti-depressant's side effects drove him to kill
eight people.
   James T. Wesbecker, executor of Joseph Wesbecker's estate, filed
the lawsuit in Jefferson Circuit Court. He seeks unspecified
damages against Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Inc., Dista Products Co. and his
father's former psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Coleman.
   Lilly is an Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company that
manufactures Prozac, and Dista is a Lilly subsidiary.
   The lawsuit alleges that Lilly failed to adequately test Prozac
and knew or should have known it wasn't safe for people to use to
treat depression.
   It also alleges that Lilly failed to make known results of tests
that the company possessed regarding the drug's adverse side
effects, which, the lawsuit said, drove Joseph Wesbecker to commit
``homicide, suicide and assault.''
   Wesbecker, carrying several semiautomatic weapons, fatally
wounded eight people during a rampage at the Standard Gravure
printing plant on Sept. 14, 1989, before killing himself.
   Five other parties involved in the shootings also filed lawsuits

   Coleman has refused to discuss the case.
   Lilly spokesman Ed West noted that other drugs were found in

   He also said more than 11,000 people participated in clinical
testing of Prozac and more than 2 million patients worldwide have
been treated with the drug in its 2{-year history. The company has
previously said that fewer than 10 physical assaults and two
murder-suicides have been reported among patients.
   ``Its safety and efficacy have been well-established through
this extensive experience,'' West said.

   Alaska officials contend the state was shorted $902 million in
royalties for oil from the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River fields
between 1977 and 1986. The state charged the oil companies often

<HEAD>London's Market Is Star Performer During Gulf Crisis</HEAD>

<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The London stock market, typically a follower of
New York and Tokyo, has managed to weather the Persian Gulf crisis
better than its global rivals, key index figures show.
   Based on calculations over the six weeks of the Gulf standoff,
London stocks are off 7.9 percent, compared with an 18.8 percent
decline in Japan's key market index and a 10 percent drop in the
Dow Jones industrial average.
   Analysts said Wednesday that Britain has fared better because
its shares were more realistically priced before Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Britain also is the non-communist world's eighth largest oil
producer, making its economy less vulnerable to oil supply
disruptions and oil price hikes, they said.
   Stocks in Japan and West Germany, where the index has fallen
16.7 percent, had been particularly overpriced, analysts said. Both
countries are heavily dependent on imported oil.
   West Germany also has suffered from the higher-than-expected
costs of German unification, said Guenter Redeker, chief economist
at Chemical Bank in Frankfurt.
   Fears that the crisis would seriously disrupt oil supplies sent
oil prices soaring from below $20 a barrel to above $30. That
heightened concerns about inflation, higher interest rates and
recession, and sent stock prices plummeting worldwide.
   In addition to reflecting the performance of their component
shares, stock indexes also are good barometers of economic
expectations, which can affect economic performance itself.
   Trading volume has been low in the major markets during the
global bear market, the analysts said.
   ``It's typical of (stock) markets generally that when they fall
there tends to be relatively little turnover. It's characteristic
in markets that when they are going up turnover tends to be higher
than when they are going down,'' said Paul Turnbull, a British
economist with the London investment firm Smith New Court PLC.
   Typically during times of turmoil, money goes on the move.
   Investors surprisingly haven't turned to the traditional safe
havens of the U.S. dollar and gold, choosing the German mark
instead. Redeker cited the attraction of relatively high German
interest rates.
   Experts generally agree that the world's major industrialized
nations are less vulnerable to ``oil shocks'' now than they were in
the 1970s.
   ``We felt the U.K. should outperform,'' said Richard Kersley, an
equity strategist at the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd. ``It should continue and is justified.''
   ``The U.K. had its feet more firmly on the ground in terms of
what its expectations of the world were before the Gulf.''
   The Gulf crisis has forced investors elsewhere to face up to
poorer earnings prospects, which existed even before the invasion,
Kersley said. Slowing economic growth and higher interest rates
around the globe are to blame.
   ``Middle East developments have basically operated as a
catalyst,'' Turnbull said. Values in Japanese and Germany, he said,
``needed to fall anyway and they still need to fall further.''
   Britain stands to gain billions of dollars of extra oil revenue.
The country, which is not a member of the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces some 2 million barrels a
day in the North Sea. It has proven reserves about 4 billion
barrels, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
   However, higher oil prices likely will worsen Britain's already
high inflation rate _ currently running just under 10 percent _ and
likely delay a cut in its 15 percent interest rates.
   Here are how the four markets' main indexes have fared during
the crisis:
   _ Britain's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed at 2,142.3 Wednesday compared with 2,326.2 on July 31, a
decline of 7.9 percent.
   _ The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial is off 10 percent from
its July 31 close of 2,905.20.
   _ Germany's DAX index is off 16.7 percent at 1,598.34 from
1,919.1.
   _ Japan's Nikkei index of 225 stocks settled at 25,216.14
Wednesday from 31,036, a decline of 18.8 percent.

<HEAD>Settlement Reached in Most Brooklyn Navy Yard Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an important settlement in the nation's
biggest product liability issue, attorneys resolved almost all 265
asbestos lawsuits related to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, pleasing a
judge who wants to clear court dockets nationwide.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York state Supreme
Court Justice Helen E. Freedman on Wednesday called off a joint
trial in the cases, which stem from asbestos exposure at the old
shipyard dating to the 1940s.
   The judges praised both sides for ``extraordinary efforts to
dispose of these cases without expensive and time-consuming
trials.'' Details on the amount of the settlements were not
revealed.
   Weinstein has been leading an effort to reduce the nation's
backlog of 90,000 asbestos lawsuits clogging state and federal
courts.
   ``This is important to demonstrate that settlement of mass cases
is possible,'' said Kenneth Feinberg, who was appointed by
Weinstein in April to try to settle the cases out of court.
   Weinstein also is participating in the restructuring of the
Manville trust, which handles some 130,000 pending settlement
claims against Manville Corp. And he is overseeing creation of a
class action to resolve lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers
that cannot meet outstanding claims.
   In several court hearings in recent months, Weinstein has
stressed the need for plaintiffs lawyers and defendant companies to
reach out-of-court settlements. He also has criticized the amount
lawyers have received for handling the cases.
   Asbestos trials routinely require redundant legal investigation
of each claim of illness or death related to asbestos, the
insulation material that was used widely at shipyards and other
construction sites for decades. The Brooklyn trial had been
expected to last six months.
   Attorneys in involved in the case said more than 200 of the 265
pending lawsuits had been settled. The judges said the remaining
cases would proceed to trial separately in state and federal court,
rather than in a joint trial.
   Settlement negotiations had whittled the number of Brooklyn Navy
Yard cases down from 615 when Weinstein and Freedman announced
consolidation into a single trial.
   Feinberg said negotiations would continue to resolve the
remaining cases before opening arguments scheduled for next week.
   New York has been slow to resolve serious cases involving
diseases such as lung cancer and other respiratory ailments because
of a glitch in state law.
   Unlike most other states, New York's legislature had applied a
statute of limitations that effectively prevented lawsuits against
asbestos makers. Illness from inhaling asbestos fibers can take
decades to appear, but the state had required suing close to the
time of exposure.
   In 1986, the state lifted the ban, allowing claimants one year
to file claims against asbestos manufacturers. Many of those
claims, some of which were diagnosed as long ago as 20 years, only
now are being resolved.
   The government shipyard in Brooklyn first opened in the 1780s
and was known formally as the New York Naval Yard. Construction
peaked during World War II, when 70,000 people worked there round
the clock. The facility was ordered closed in 1964.

<HEAD>Arby's Plans to Expand Program for Taking Payment by Credit Card</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customers of company-owned Arby's restaurants
will soon be able to pay for their sandwiches, shakes and fries
with a credit card under a program the fast-food operator is
launching with MasterCard International.
   Atlanta-based Arby's and other fast-food chains have been
testing credit-card payment plans in specific markets for several
years.
   But Arby's said Wednesday its move to take its program to all
its company-owned stores would make it the first major fast-food
chain to accept credit cards on a national scale.
   The company said it plans to start taking credit cards in early
October at its company-owned stores in Portland, Ore., and later
this year at company-owned stores in Toledo, Ohio; Salt Lake City,
Utah; Memphis, Tenn., and West Palm Beach, Fla.
   In 1991, the program will be expanded to the other 17 cities
where the company owns restaurants. There are 2,350 Arby's
restaurants nationwide, but only 244 are owned by the company
itself. The others are franchised and it is up to their owners
whether to take credit cards.
   MasterCard and Arby's said they would spend $1 million over the
next year to promote the program through advertising and signs in
the stores.
   Rege Braun, director of research and development operations for
Arby's Inc., said the company expects that by taking credit cards,
sales will improve.
   In tests in about 100 Arby's restaurants in Cleveland,
Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Youngstown, Ohio, the company found the
average purchase with a credit card was $6 to $7 compared with an
average of $3.80 for someone paying with cash.
   ``In many cases when you are using plastic, the natural tendency
is to be freer with your money,'' Braun said.
   In addition, he said the chance to pay with a credit card could
attract customers who may otherwise go home because they had too
little cash to feed the family or go to a more expensive restaurant
that accepts credit cards.
   Braun said that while the marketing campaign will mention only
MasterCard, Arby's also intends to accept Visa credit cards.
   Jody Hancock, a MasterCard executive responsible for new market
development, said the company is involved in similar test programs
with seven of the top 10 fast-food restaurant chains, but that
Arby's is the first to begin expanding nationally to all its
company-owned stores.
   She said the system will use a payment technology that will
allow customers to pay for their food in seconds without having to
sign a receipt slip. The store owner will pass the card through a
monitor that will screen out stolen or invalid cards in less time
that it would take to pay cash and get change, she said.
   She said MasterCard has been intent on positioning itself as
``the best card for mainstream America'' and hopes to get movie
houses, parking lots and convenience stores to begin accepting the
credit cards as well.
   MasterCard is accepted at 8.2 million locations around the
world, she said.

<HEAD>After-Hours Plan Responds to Competition, But Not Everyone Happy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two after-hours trading sessions mark the New
York Stock Exchange's first decisive response to eroding market
share and competing technology in the United States and abroad, but
not everyone is happy.
   Experts said the move risks alienating the NYSE's powerful
specialists but is necessary to lure back large amounts of
institutional stock trading that has defected to foreign markets,
particularly London.
   ``The exchange is really trying to speed up the introduction of
new technology and is using this after-hours trading as a way of
getting it done,'' Hans Stoll, a finance professor at Vanderbilt
University's graduate management school, said Wednesday.
   ``I view it as a political way to introduce things that some of
the membership finds unpalatable,'' he said.
   The NYSE Tuesday announced sessions that would last until 5 p.m.
and 5:15 p.m., beyond the market's normal 4 p.m. close.
   The sessions, designed for trading by large institutions and not
individual investors, will provide much-desired trading anonymity
now available in some foreign markets and on competing private
networks in this country.
   ``It's an effort to both modernize and deal with the realities
of the global trading system,'' said Jeffrey Tabak, a principal in
the New York program trading firm Miller, Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co.
   The London market, which is entirely electronic with no trading
floor or specialists monitoring trades, is used widely by big
institutions that conduct computerized program trades typically
involving thousands of shares at once.
   In the week of Aug. 20-24, for instance, 16.4 percent of all
program trading activity was conducted on foreign markets, exchange
statistics show. Overall, the percentage of trades in NYSE-listed
stocks handled by the Big Board slipped to 69 percent last year
from about 85 percent in 1980.
   The NYSE plan would try to staunch some of that lost business.
During the two after-hours trading periods, known as ``crossing
sessions,'' buyers and sellers of stocks would be matched
electronically.
   The sessions could start later this year pending Securities and
Exchange Commission approval. They would bypass the NYSE floor
specialists, who regulate trading, for the first time in the
exchange's 198 years.
   The exchange envisions some night trading in 1991 with 24-hour
trading by the year 2000 if members want it.
   Experts said declining revenue and new technology growth has
pushed the Big Board into after-hours trading. Antagonizing
specialists has long been a fear for the NYSE and their reaction
was predictably chilly.
   ``It is a far cry from trading as anyone knows it,'' said one
floor specialist who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It is a
feeble response to the perceived competitive threat.''
   The first after-hours session would run from 4:15 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Traders would be able to enter into the exchange's computer system
orders to buy or sell stock or orders in which buyers and sellers
already are matched.
   At 5 p.m., the exchange would attempt to match and execute
orders. Unmatched trades would be returned to customers. All orders
would be executed at closing prices and trading in a company's
stock would be halted for the session if any news developed
affecting its price.
   The second session is designed to recapture program trading now
done in London. It would last from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. and would
continue regardless of news developments.
   That session is expected to be crucial to big Wall Street
program traders such as Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., PaineWebber Inc. and
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., which regularly trade after hours in London.
   The most common of such trades now conducted in London involve
converting stock-index futures contracts into the underlying stocks
by selling the contract to a broker, who sells the shares to an
investor. Stock-index futures are contracts based on market indexes
such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.
   The NYSE hopes to erase the factors that make London attractive.
London's advantages include relaxed disclosure requirements,
guaranteed execution of trades, no limitations on trading and
cheaper costs.
   Under current Big Board rules, each part of a program trade
involving a market index must be conducted separately with all
stocks traded at current market prices. The new rules would allow
an aggregate trade with prices based on the index level.
   Closing prices of individual stocks are not expected to be
changed by the new sessions, but some market data will be affected.
   The NYSE said trading volume from the first session will be
incorporated into the day's individual stock volumes and total
volume. Volume and the total dollar value of trading in the second
session will be reported separately.
   There will be no public disclosure of participants in the trades
in either session, the exchange said, but NYSE regulatory
guidelines will apply to the new trading.

   Coca-Cola touts itself as the real thing in its
advertising, and consumers worldwide appear to have bought that
line.
   The soft drink finished ahead of Sony, Mercedes-Benz and about
6,000 other brands in a new survey by the image consulting firm
Landor Associates.
   The San Francisco-based marketing firm interviewed about 10,000
people in the United States, Japan and Western Europe, asking them
to rate brands according to how familiar they were and how highly
they thought of them.
   Trailing the top three brands in the global rankings were Kodak,
Disney, Nestle, Toyota, McDonald's, IBM and Pepsi-Cola, according
to the survey results released Wednesday.
   Twenty-three of the top 50 brands in the global survey are from
the United States, 17 are European, nine are Japanese and one is
from a company based in the United States and Europe.
   Coca-Cola had led a similar Landor survey conducted in late 1988.
   Coca-Cola also was rated the most powerful brand among U.S.
consumers and among European consumers when results for those
groups were compiled separately. Sony was rated as the most
powerful among Japanese consumers.
   Don Casey, president of Landor Associates, said the results
demonstrated the importance of establishing an identity and
sticking with it over the years.
   ``The guys who have paid their dues and have a consistent image
have done quite well,'' he said.
   Casey said the results also indicate a contrast between
realistic American tastes and the high aspirations of non-American
consumers.
   On the U.S. list, Coca-Cola was followed by Campbell's, Disney,
Pepsi-Cola, Kodak, NBC, Black &amp; Decker, Kellogg's, McDonald's and
Hershey's.
   The top 10 lists for European and Japanese consumers included
brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Rolls Royce.

   A judge has cleared the way for a public
hearing in the government's savings and loan case against Neil
Bush, and Bush's attorney says ``the swords are drawn.''
   An administrative law judge has denied Bush's request to dismiss
the regulators' case against him for alleged conflict of interest
in his role as a former director of a collapsed Colorado thrift.
   Judge Daniel J. Davidson rejected Bush's petition in an order
issued Tuesday. The Office of Thrift Supervision, which is seeking
to bar the president's son from working for any bank or savings and
loan, made Davidson's decision public late Wednesday.
   Bush, 35, was an outside director of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that failed in late 1988 at a
cost to taxpayers estimated at $1 billion.
   In written arguments submitted to Davidson late last month, Bush
said there was no possibility that he could continue the alleged
abuses since Silverado already has been taken over by the
government. Bush continued to deny any wrongdoing.
   The judge, in a one-page order, rejected Bush's argument, saying
it was not supported by existing regulations or case law.
   ``The next step is to go to the hearing,'' Bush's attorney,
James Nesland, said Wednesday from his Denver office. ``The swords
are drawn.''
   Davidson's decision clears the way for a public hearing that had
previously been scheduled before the judge starting Sept. 25 in
Denver. Sometime after the hearing, the judge is expected to make a
recommendation to the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
Timothy Ryan.
   In its response to Bush's request, the thrift agency had told
Davidson in a brief filed Monday that Bush could become a director
at another financial institution and repeat the conduct that harmed
Silverado.
   ``Indeed, throughout these proceedings (Bush) has evidenced no
willingness to consider that he has done anything wrong, nor even
any understanding that he ever had potential conflicts of
interest,'' the agency's brief said.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it was clear that Bush's
conduct ``was contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent
operation'' and could cause harm to any financial institution if
continued.
   The regulators have accused Bush of conflict of interest for not
disclosing his business ties to two big Silverado borrowers,
developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters.
   Bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering filing against him
and other former Silverado directors.
   Bush and Nesland have maintained that the regulators' actions
are politically motivated.

   The alliance allows Ecolab to position itself for stronger
international growth as the European Community moves toward a
single market in 1992.
   Ecolab Chairman Pierson Grieve said a major motivation for the
deal was to prepare the company for the economic unification of
Western Europe.
   In the cleaning and sanitation industry, ``There are three
(companies) larger than us in Europe ... and the chances of us
catching any of them were very small. It would have required a lot
of years, and money,'' he said. The combination with Henkel means
that the joint venture will have the largest European market share
in three of the joint venture's four product segments and the
second-largest share in the remaining segment, he said.
   ``What we've done is to strategically position Ecolab so that
over time in the 1990s we'll have shifted a lot of our marketing
power, technical ability and investment into the rest of the
world,'' he said.
   The announcement got generally favorable reviews from securities
analysts and the stock market.
   Frank Rolfes, an analyst with Dain Bosworth of Minneapolis, said
the deal appears to be a good one for Ecolab. ``It will dilute
(Ecolab's) control and ownership, but I think that the strong
competitive position they're acquiring will outweigh that,'' he
said.
   In December, Ecolab issued $110 million of convertible preferred
stock to Henkel as an initial step in the deal. The agreement
includes the combination of the European cleaning businesses of
both companies in a joint venture with each partner having a 50
percent interest. Henkel will serve as managing partner and
headquarters will be in Dusseldorf, the companies said.
   In connection with the sale of non-European cleaning businesses
to Ecolab, Henkel will receive about $74 million and 5.6 million
shares of Ecolab's common stock. Henkel will receive an additional
$110 million, reflecting its investment in the Ecolab convertible
preferred stock, which will be retired when the deal closes, the
two companies said.
   Henkel will be represented on Ecolab's board of directors.
   The primary change will occur in Europe with the creation of
Henkel-Ecolab, owned jointly by both partners. Initially, this
business will have approximately $750 million in revenues and about
3,500 workers, the companies said.
   Ecolab's purchase of most of Henkel's remaining worldwide
cleaning and sanitizing operations will initially increase Ecolab's
revenues by over $50 million in Asia and Latin America, Grieve
said. He said the deal should not dilute Ecolab's 1991 per share
earnings.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, Ecolab reported sales of $1.3
billion and earnings of $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share.
   Henkel had 1989 sales of $6.2 billion and net earnings of $217.2
million.
   Regulatory approvals are required in various jurisdictions. The
deal is expected to be completed at the beginning of 1991.

<HEAD>Judge Clears Tylenol Damage Case for Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families of seven people killed with
cyanide-contaminated Tylenol capsules eight years ago have won the
right to go to trial to seek damages against the manufacturer of
the pain remedy.
   Circuit Judge Donald P. O'Connell on Wednesday rejected McNeil
Consumer Products Inc.'s motion to dismiss the case for lack of
sufficient evidence. O'Connell set trial for Oct. 19, but company
lawyers said they will seek a continuance.
   Seven people died after taking capsules of Extra-Strength
Tylenol in 1982 and investigators concluded that someone poisoned
the capsules after they left the factory. No one has been charged
with the killings.
   Even though the cyanide was put in the capsules after they left
the company's control, McNeil was negligent in not providing
tamper-resistant packaging, said Bruce R. Pfaff, a lawyer for
families of two of the victims.
   ``In the three or four years preceding the poisonings, the
company received over 200 complaints of individuals writing that
something was wrong with their Tylenol,'' Pfaff said. ``Either
capsules were missing, or some other medication was mixed in or
there were foreign objects, pieces of metal and even fingernails.''
   Pfaff said company investigations showed most or all of these
complaints were traced to tampering after the medicine left the
manufacturer.
   He said the issue of tampering was a common subject in trade
journals of the packaging industry for 10 years or more before the
Tylenol incident.
   The plaintiffs' attorneys will try to convince the jury that
McNeil was negligent not merely in its packaging, but also in its
decision to sell the remedy in capsule form, which is more subject
to tampering that a tablet.
   ``Methods to deter tampering were well known and economically
feasible,'' Pfaff said. He said when the company redesigned its
packaging after the poisonings, ``It cost 2 cents a package to cure
this problem.''
   In accordance with Illinois law, the civil action against McNeil
specifies no amount being sought, other than ``in excess of
$15,000.''
   ``Obviously, the losses are far, far greater than that,'' said
Pfaff.

<TEXT>
   An attorney who sold inside information to a
stock broker about planned corporate takeovers pleaded guilty for
his part in a multimillion-dollar scheme.
   Steven L. Glauberman, formerly with a prestigious corporate law
firm, pleaded guilty on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Miriam
Cedarbaum to two counts of securities fraud and one of wire fraud.
He faces a maximum fine of $250,000 and up to five years in prison
on each count when sentenced Dec. 21.
   Glauberman, 39, of Manhattan, was charged last month by the U.S.
attorney's office with four counts of conspiracy, securities fraud
and wire fraud.
   Glauberman was an associate specializing in mergers and
acquisitions at the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom at
the time at issue.
   The government alleged he leaked inside information about
clients involved in some of the best-known takeovers of the 1980s
to a stock broker, Eben Smith, who passed it along to others.
   The tips included information about Bristol-Meyers' 1985 bid for
Genetic Systems, a 1985 management leveraged buyout of National
Gypsum, Black &amp; Decker's 1988 unsolicited bid for American Standard
and Walt Disney Co.'s offer for Gibson Greetings.
   Last month, Glauberman settled a civil complaint by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay back $221,000
in his alleged illegal profits.
   The SEC said the stock broker, Smith, paid Glauberman $50,000
for the information and also traded in a special account for
Glauberman's benefit.
   Smith, 41, of Greenwich, Conn., faces criminal conspiracy and
securities fraud charges.

<DATELINE>STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikorsky Aircraft will lay off 350
salaried employees Saturday, the helicopter manufacturer said.
   Sikorsky spokesman William Tuttle said Wednesday the
white-collar layoffs are part of an effort to make the company more
competitive.
   The Stratford-based company, the helicopter division of United
Technologies Corp., will have a workforce of 11,300 after the
layoffs, Tuttle said.
   The employees facing lay offs were informed Wednesday of the
company's decision, he said.
   In addition to Stratford, Sikorsky has operations in Bridgeport,
West Haven, Shelton and Trumbull, as well as Troy, Ala., and West
Palm Beach, Fla. Tuttle said most of the layoffs will come from
Sikorsky's Connecticut operations, but he did not provide further
details.
   Some of those being laid off are engineers, he said, declining
further comment on other classifications of employees being laid
off.
   Sikorsky laid off 300 white-collar workers in February, citing
defense budget cuts in the United States and foreign countries.
Fifty hourly workers were laid off in March, and another 50 hourly
jobs were cut through attrition that month.
   Tuttle said Sikorsky was scheduled to deliver 120 helicopters to
U.S. military services in the 1990 fiscal year, down from 137 last
year.
   Michael LaTronica, aerospace analyst for Labe Simpson &amp; Co. in
New York, said Sikorsky was ``trying to cut costs for a downturn in
the defense budget, which will undoubtedly affect them.''
   LaTronica said the layoffs were part of Sikorsky's strategy ``to
size for the business that's out there.''

<HEAD>UAW Can Pick and Choose Strategies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union, whose influence in
American labor shrank in the 1980s, can pick and choose from a
variety of options as bargaining with General Motors Corp. enters
its last days.
   Depending on the strategy chosen, the UAW could have a dramatic
effect on the already sagging U.S. economy.
   In a nutshell, the union has three choices: reach agreement
before the current contract expires at midnight Friday, extend the
current agreement beyond then or stage some kind of strike.
   But such a decision may be moot if indications Wednesday prove
true.
   Union officials in Detroit and elsewhere said there were
indications that the union was moving toward a settlement before
the midnight Friday expiration of the national UAW-GM contact.
   National UAW officials called local leaders to suburban Detroit
on Monday amid speculation that national contract talks were
heading toward a settlement rather than a strike. But they
cautioned that progress could be derailed at any time.
   With a strike fund of about $770 million, the union has the
fiscal flexibility to take a large number of the GM workers out of
the company's plants for a long time.
   But the union may feel that a strike is unnecessary to
demonstrate its dissatisfaction with GM.
   Ironically, the company's money-savings moves since the
mid-1980s have given the union the means to drive home its points
with GM.
   Because of a move to a ``just-in-time'' parts delivery system
for its assembly plants, the union has regained some of the clout
in garnered in the 1970s from its size _ 1.5 million members,
mostly in the auto industry.
   GM's reliance, like other automakers, on the ``just-in-time''
system, which delivers parts to its assembly plants frequently a
few hours before they are installed, cuts warehousing and inventory
costs but leaves the automaker vulnerable to labor problems.
   The UAW demonstrated that last month, when it staged a walkout
involving about 2,800 workers at GM's AC Rochester West plant in
Flint, where fuel tanks and other parts of GM cars and trucks are
made.
   When the supply of fuel tanks stopped, so did assembly plants.
   The strike was seen as a signal of what the union could do to
the automaker if national talks broke down.
   By the time the six-day strike was over, seven assembly plants
and portions of more than a dozen component factories had been shut
down, temporarily idling more than 20,000 workers.
   Whenever an assembly plant shuts down, layoffs ripple out.
Depending on how long production at an assembly plant is
interrupted, effects can be felt throughout the auto supplier
industry, including plastic, glass, rubber and steel makers.
   Labor negotiations in the auto industry come as the economy is
slowing down and predictions of a recession are growing.
   The government recently reported that unemployment in August
reached 5.6 percent, the highest level in two years; annual growth
of the gross national product has dropped to 1.2 percent and many
analysts project it to fall further; and orders for durable goods,
including cars, have been flat.
   In 1970 an already-weak economy slipped into recession when the
UAW struck GM for 69 days, said Donald Ratajczak of the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta. At that
time, he said, GM played a much larger part in the U.S. economy
than it does now.
   ``Therefore, it (GM) by itself isn't going to take down the
economy,'' Ratajczak said Wednesday. ``Although it's a negative.
We're being hit by negatives all over the place.''
   He said auto negotiations this year come ``at a bad time when
consumer psychology is hurting anyway. You start to run up the
unemployment rate (from a strike) and you'll kill Christmas.''

<HEAD>Corroon &amp; Black Gets Higher Bid From Aon Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corroon &amp; Black Corp.'s plans to merge with
fellow insurance broker Willis Faber PLC of Britain were thrown
into question by a higher cash offer from another insurer, Aon Corp.
   Aon, the holding company for the brokerage Rollins Burdick
Hunter Group Inc., said Wednesday it would pay $40 a share, or
about $840 million, for Corroon &amp; Black.
   That tops the stock-swap merger agreement between Corroon &amp;
Black and Willis Faber valued at more than $750 million.
   In a terse statement Wednesday responding to the offer, Corroon
&amp; Black noted its prior agreement with Willis Faber and said it
would respond to Aon after its board had time to study the bid.
   Willis Faber said today it remained committed to its agreement
with Corroon &amp; Black.
   Aon indicated it would not launch a hostile bid for Corroon &amp;
Black should its target spurn the offer.
   ``We are not interested in pursuing any transaction which is
opposed by your board of directors,'' Aon chairman Patrick G. Ryan
said in a letter to Corroon &amp; Black chairman Richard H. Miller.
   In his letter, Ryan said that under terms of the Willis Faber
merger, Corroon &amp; Black can negotiate with and provide information
to ``any third party which proposes a transaction with the board of
Corroon.''
   He also said Corroon &amp; Black was free to end its merger deal
with Willis Faber in favor of a higher offer.
   Corroon &amp; Black shareholders were scheduled to vote on the
merger with Willis Faber on Sept. 28. The stock-swap merger would
give the shareholders 7.8 Willis Faber shares for each Corroon &amp;
Black share, or $33.49 at current market prices, in a deal valued
at $754 million.
   Corroon &amp; Black and Willis Faber are the world's fifth- and
sixth-largest insurance brokerages, respectively.
   Ira H. Malis, an insurance industry analyst with Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons Inc. in Baltimore, said that while Aon had a higher bid on the
table, ``strategically, the deal with Willis Faber makes more
sense.''
   Willis Faber was a wholesale insurance broker, while Corroon &amp;
Black worked on a retail level, Malis said. There was more overlap,
and likely to be layoffs, in a marriage between Aon and Corroon &amp;
Black, he said.
   James Guenther, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps, said he expected
Corroon &amp; Black management to stick with the Willis Faber deal. But
he added that despite the deal's merits, the company ``will find it
rather difficult to ignore this fairly significant premium.''
   Investors bid up Corroon &amp; Black stock Wednesday, hoping the
company might accept the offer. Corroon &amp; Black shares shot up
$6.75 to close at $37.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Aon shares declined _ a common response by investors to a
company that has raised the possibility of taking on a heavy debt
load to finance an aquisition _$1.50 to $33 on the NYSE.
   Willis Faber stock, which is traded on London's Stock Exchange,
was not affected by the announcement of the Aon bid, which came
after the close of trading in Britain. The stock did not trade
early today in London.
   The Corroon &amp; Black-Willis Faber merger, announced in early
June, would allow both firms to expand in the other's home market
and eventually move into continental Europe and the Pacific Rim.
   The new firm, Britain-based Willis Corroon PLC, was expected to
have 1990 revenue of about $1 billion. It would create the world's
fourth-largest insurance brokerage in terms of revenue.
   Corroon &amp; Black also provides risk management advice,
reinsurance brokerage and other services. Willis Faber handles
insurance and reinsurance brokerage as well as risk management
services.
   Corroon &amp; Black has nearly all its business in the United
States, while Willis Faber gets about 80 percent of its revenue
from Britain. Corroon &amp; Black sold its 29.9 percent interest in the
British broker Minet Holdings PLC in February 1988.
   Aon has operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and the
Pacific. Besides Rollins Burdick, its subsidiaries include Combined
Insurance Co. of America and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co.
   Malis said a combination between Corroon &amp; Black and Aon would
create the third-largest insurance company in the nation and the
fourth or fifth largest in the world.
   Aon likely would have difficulty pursuing a hostile takeover
because of laws in Delaware, where Corroon &amp; Black is incorporated,
have created obstacles to thwart many unwanted bids.

   Officials from ServiceMaster and Waste Management
Inc. have tentatively agreed to form a limited partnership.
   Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Waste Management will
contribute its pest control and Tru-Green lawn-care businesses,
together valued at $180 million. It will have a 22 percent interest
in the partnership.
   ServiceMaster, in turn, will contribute its consumer services
businesses, which includes the Service Master cleaning services,
the Terminix termite and pest-control businesses. Also included are
the Merry Maids business and the American Home Shield home-service
warranty business.
   ServiceMaster, based in north suburban Downers Groves, will hold
78 percent of the new company's equity.
   The new partnership, if approved by both companies' boards, will
be named ServiceMaster Consumer Services Limited Partnership.
   In addition to its 22 percent stake in the partnership, Waste
Management will have a member on the new company's board of
directors.
   ``They (Waste Management officials) won't really be involved in
the day-to-day operations,'' said Roger Ervin, a ServiceMaster
spokesman. ``We will be doing that.''
   The two units of Waste Management involved in the partnership
compose a small portion of the Oak Brook-based company, which last
year had $4.5 billion in revenues.

<HEAD>Trader's Attorney: Merc Rules Routinely Ignored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago Mercantile Exchange rules ``don't work''
and everyone ``from the top on down'' regularly ignores them, says
an attorney at the trial of 14 Japanese yen futures traders.
   But Attorney Thomas Durkin, representing trader Sam Cali, told
federal jurors hearing the case that technical rule violations
don't add up to a racketeering conspiracy.
   ``It ain't a conspiracy when everybody's doing it,'' Durkin
argued Wednesday in U.S. District Court. ``There may be something
wrong, but it ain't a conspiracy.''
   The Mercantile Exchange immediately issued a statement denying
rules are routinely broken.
   ``These allegations are absolutely baseless,'' an exchange
spokesman said.
   The case of the yen traders is the second trial in a wide
ranging federal probe of corruption at the Mercantile Exchange and
the Chicago Board of Trade. The first trial _ that of Swiss franc
futures traders _ resulted in a hung jury on many of the counts.
   A third trial, involving several soybean traders and brokers at
the Board of Trade, is set to begin Monday.
   On Wednesday, Durkin said two sets of rules are used at the
exchange _ a cosmetic set for tourists in the Merc's viewing
gallery and an illegal set for brokers and traders.
   Another defense attorney, Edward Genson, asked U.S. District
Judge William Hart to declare a mistrial based on Durkin's remarks,
saying Durkin suggested all of the defendants are guilty. Hart
denied the motion.
   Prosecutors say the defendants routinely shifted personal
financial liabilities of trading errors onto their customers.
   Attorneys say the trial could last up to six months.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Threatens Japan's Economic Boom, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation sparked by higher oil prices resulting
from the Gulf crisis is threatening Japan's long-term economic
expansion, Japan's central bank governor said Thursday.
   But a quarterly survey showed most businessmen believe the
economy is resilient enough to weather the crisis without a major
setback.
   ``Rising price pressures and the new factor of current high oil
prices require extreme caution,'' Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi
Mieno told a convention of securities dealers. ``The price
environment is severe.''
   Mieno and other officials addressing the convention noted that
the Gulf crisis had hit financial markets hard as investors reacted
with concern over higher oil prices.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange had stabilized during the summer after
losing about one-quarter of its value during a prolonged correction
this spring, but the Gulf crisis further eroded the value of its
key index.
   On Aug. 23, the Nikkei Stock Average hit 23,737.63 points, 39
percent below its record 38,915.87-point close on Dec. 28, 1989.
Since then, it has edged up in a series of volatile trading
sessions. On Thursday, the Nikkei fell 141.06 points to 25,075.08.
   Although the market has lost about 200 trillion yen, or $1.45
trillion, of its value since December, personal spending and
corporate investment remain robust, Mieno said.
   The Bank of Japan's latest quarterly survey of business
sentiment, released earlier this week, indicates that most
executives remain fairly bullish about the economy despite the Gulf
crisis, he noted.
   The central bank's business condition index edged down only
slightly to 46 in August from 48 in May. The index is the
percentage of the 691 companies surveyed that report favorable
business conditions minus those who report they are unfavorable.
   Japan is in its 46th straight month of economic expansion. The
central bank, however, has raised interest rates five times since
May 1989 to help curb inflationary pressures generated by growth in
the money supply and a labor shortage.
   The latest hike, on Aug. 30, raised the official discount rate
by 0.75 percentage point to 6 percent.

   Delta Air Lines has announced its second fare
increase in a month, blaming it on rising fuel prices resulting
from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Atlanta-based airline said Wednesday its fares will go up
4.2 percent on Oct. 1. Delta raised its fares 5.3 percent on Aug.
30.
   Delta follows Pan American World Airways in making a second fare
hike because of the fuel price increase. Pan Am said it would raise
fares 4.4 percent next Tuesday. Other major carriers, some of whom
made larger initial increases, said a decision to raise fares was
under review.
   Most airlines raised their fare prices shortly after Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, sending oil prices upward. Delta said its
fuel costs have risen 33{ cents a gallon since July 31, which
amounts to $670 million a year.

   The stock market headed lower in slow trading
today as investors braced for some expected negative news on the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.89 points to
2,614.85 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by 3 to 2 in the early tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 322 up, 484 down and 489

   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for August.
   Analysts expect the index, a measure of inflationary pressures
in the pipelines of the economy, to show a big jump as a result of
higher energy costs.
   Data on retail sales and industrial production for last month
are also slated to be issued before the market opening.
   Those figures, which will be flat or only slightly higher if
advance estimates are correct, stand to be closely watched as
potential gauges of whether a recession can be avoided.
   Losers among the blue chips included McDonald's, down { at 27;
General Electric, down \ at 61}; Philip Morris, down \ at 45\, and
Exxon, down \ at 51&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .51 to 176.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .70 at 322.49.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.12 to

   Unemployment in Britain rose to 5.8 percent in
August, the Department of Employment said Thursday.
   The jobless figure, adjusted for seasonal variations, was up
from 5.7 percent in the previous month.
   Last week, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the U.S.
unemployment rate had risen to 5.6 percent in August from 5.5
percent in July.

   It's crunch time in New York's newspaper wars
and thousands of jobs and some long journalistic traditions hang in
the balance.
   The economy, combined with the competition, is threatening two
of the city's tabloids.
   The no-holds-barred New York Post, which has suffered losses for
years, says that the hemorrhaging must end and that it will shut
down with Saturday's edition unless its unions agree to more than
$19 million in concessions.
   At the money-losing Daily News, months-long labor negotiations
appear stalemated. Management has made extensive preparations for a
strike. The unions continue working but are urging advertisers to
boycott the paper.
   ``There is an adequate market here for at least one (tabloid)
paper, possibly two,'' said Ken Noble, a media analyst with Paine
Webber.
   Which would be fine for the two newspapers if New York Newsday,
a third tabloid also losing money, did not have a profitable
parent, the Times Mirror Co., patiently waiting for the market to
sort itself out.
   The city's fourth major daily, The New York Times, is
profitable, though less so than a year ago.
   The Times also will seek concessions from the unions to the
extent that they involve the same economic conditions that have
affected the Post and News, said William Adler, a Times spokesman.
   All four newspapers are suffering from an unofficial recession
slamming the Northeast that has retail advertising down.
   The Post _ founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton _ has the worst
economic problems. Three owners in the past two decades have lost
millions of dollars. Now its already slim ad linage is down.
   ``They're the most likely to go out of business,'' Noble said.
   On Sept. 4, Post Publisher Peter S. Kalikow told the paper's
unions that he was losing $27 million a year on the tabloid and
that he needed concessions from them of $17.4 million in payroll
and $1.9 million in benefits.
   He set an 8 p.m. Friday deadline for an agreement. Otherwise, he
said the paper would report in its Saturday editions that it was
closing and 960 employees would be out of work.
   ``He did not want to read about the future of the New York Post
in another newspaper,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a Post spokesman.
   With headlines like ``READ MY LIPS: I LIED'' and ``UP YOURS!''
to Saddam Hussein, and its all-time classic about a tavern killing
_ ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' _ the Post strikes a chord that
summons readers to newsstands. But its circulation is now about
505,000, down from 900,000 in the past decade.
   ``The New York Post has been very honest in coming to us with
this economic problem,'' said George McDonald, president of the
Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group representing nine
unions at the Post. ``We're going to do everything possible to help
the Post stay in business.''
   The News too is claiming losses _ $115 million from 1979 to 1989
on revenues of $4 billion _ but also is trying to undo what it says
are archaic work rules that result in overstaffing on the presses
and among drivers.
   In the last decade, its circulation has dropped about 700,000 to
1,180,000.
   The News has said it needs new color presses to replace its
30-to 40-year-old equipment and stay competitive. While the unions,
which represent about 3,000 workers, recognize the need for new
presses, they claim the News' parent, the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
is out to break them in order to sell the paper.
   Daily News unions point to the hiring of King and Ballow, a
Nashville, Tenn., law firm they say has a reputation for
union-busting; the hiring of replacement workers, and the training
of management to run the presses if workers strike.
   Management at the News has already told the unions that it
expects concessions equal to anything granted the Post. To put on
the pressure, the unions are urging advertisers to boycott the News
until a settlement is reached.
   ``It's a fight to the death over at the New York News right
now,'' said Noble.
   New York Newsday, meanwhile, has trucks ready to roll if the
News folds or goes on strike or if the Post expires, he said.
Newsday, with its circulation of 225,000, ``would leap into the
breach. They sure would,'' Noble said.

<TEXT>
   France's major liquor manufacturers Thursday
offered to contribute millions of dollars to alcoholism prevention
programs if the government backed off a plan to prohibit liquor ads.
   The companies also proposed the creation of a commission
representing the public and private sectors to regulate liquor
advertising.
   The proposals were drafted by a group of executives from
Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Pernod Ricard, Champagne de Venoge,
Martini et Rossi France, Seagram France and other companies.
   Thierry Mantoux, chief executive of Champagne de Venoge, said
the industry contribution would be in proportion to the amount of
money each company spent on advertising. He predicted that tens of
millions of francs would be generated for alcohol prevention.
   Parliament earlier this year approved a plan by Health Minister
Claude Evin to ban tobacco and alcohol advertising starting in 1993.

<HEAD>Hamilton Gets UK Approval To Tap North Sea Gas Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hamilton Oil Co. and four partners plan to tap a
giant natural gas reserve off the coast of Scotland, in a $2.85
billion deal that could create the largest gas project in the
British North Sea.
   The United Kingdom Department of Energy agreed Wednesday to
allow Denver-based Hamilton and its partners to drill a series of
wells in the Bruce field, 240 miles northeast of Aberdeen, Scotland.
   The Bruce field is considered attractive because it also
contains oil reserves that are expected to yield 80,000 barrels of
crude a day when production reaches its peak.
   The field was discovered more than 10 years ago, but the
Hamilton group only recently reached marketing agreements to sell
the gas to two British power companies, British Gas and Corby Power
Ltd.
   Hamilton officials hope to start drawing gas in October 1993.
They said that when production reaches its peak in 1994, the field
should produce 520 million cubic feet of gas a day, making it the
largest such project in the region.
   Hamilton, an independent oil company, will pay about $450
million of the development costs and take a 16 percent stake in the
project. Its partners include the French petrochemical companies
Elf-Aquitaine and Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, as well
as British Petroleum and London-based Ultramer Exploration Ltd.
   Hamilton began drilling in the North Sea with projects dating to
1975, and the company has been stepping up its exploration in the
area in recent years.

   The stock market retreated in slow trading today
as investors braced for some expected negative news on the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 13.12 points on
Wednesday, dropped 17.08 to 2,608.66 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 399 up, 690 down and
504 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 35.66 million shares at
midmorning.
   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for August.
   Analysts expect the index, a measure of inflationary pressures
in the pipelines of the economy, to show a big jump as a result of
higher energy costs.
   Data on retail sales and industrial production for last month
are also slated to be issued before the market opening.
   Those figures, which will be flat or only slightly higher if
advance estimates are correct, stand to be closely watched as
potential gauges of whether a recession can be avoided.

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today the fund that protects bank depositors will likely ``remain
under stress for some time to come,'' but he cautioned Congress
against hastily passing legislation that would only make the
situation worse.
   Greenspan noted that the reserves in the Federal Deposit
Insurance Fund now stand at their lowest level ever as a string of
near-record bank failures has depleted FDIC reserves.
   ``There remain all too many problems in the banking system,
problems that have been growing of late as many banks, including
many larger banks, have been experiencing a deterioration in the
quality of their loan portfolios, particularly real estate loans,''
Greenspan told a House committee.
   ``It thus seems clear that the insurance fund likely will remain
under stress for some time to come,'' Greenspan said. ``Moreover,
pressures would intensify if real estate market conditions were to
weaken further or a recession were to develop in the general
economy.''
   Greenspan's warning was similar, although less specific, than
reports earlier this week from the congressional General Accounting
Office and the Congressional Budget Office.
   Both agencies warned that one large bank failure or a further
downturn in the economy could wipe out the remaining $13.2 billion
in the FDIC insurance fund and force taxpayers to provide a bailout.
   It was the depletion of a separate insurance fund for deposits
in the savings and loan industry that prompted legislation last
year that is expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of
dollars over the next 30 years.
   Members of Congress, alarmed by the reports that the FDIC fund
is also in trouble, have rushed to introduce legislation to boost
its resources and thus avert a similar bailout for the bank fund.
   Greenspan cautioned that while ``reform is needed. So is
caution.''
   He spoke against proposals to reduce the insurance limit from
$100,000 and said it would be difficult to administer a law which
limited the number of deposits each individual could have.
   He also said lawmakers should not be too aggressive in boosting
the premiums banks must pay for deposit insurance and run the risk
of making the industry uncompetitive.
   Greenspan's testimony before the House Banking Committee
followed two days of hearings this week by the Senate Banking
Committee on the state of the deposit insurance fund.
   Comptroller Charles A. Bowsher of the General Accounting Office
said Tuesday that the FDIC fund, currently with $13.2 billion in
resources, is dwindling so rapidly that it could be wiped out by a
recession or a single big bank failure. Taxpayers would be forced
to cover the costs.
   Bowsher's dire warning was followed by testimony Wednesday in
which the Congressional Budget Office predicted that even without a
recession some 600 to 700 commercial banks will likely fail over
the next 3{ years, draining $20 billion out of the FDIC insurance
fund.
   Both reports heightened fears in Congress that banks, just like
savings and loan associations, could require a multibillion-dollar
taxpayer bailout unless something is done.
   Responding to the reports, lawmakers introduced bills to uncap
the deposit insurance premiums and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady indicated that the Bush administration would soon offer its
own proposal to raise premiums.
   The FDIC now charges banks 12 cents a year for every $100 the
agency insures. Under the S&amp;L bailout law passed last year, the
premiums will automatically rise next January to 15 cents per $100
of insurance. The FDIC has proposed raising the assessment to 19.5
cents.
   But even with the larger increase, the GAO said insurance funds
would still have insufficient reserves to cover possible losses to
bank depositors during a recession without an infusion of taxpayer
dollars.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich.,
introduced legislation Wednesday that would allow the FDIC to raise
its reserves by $25 billion to $35 billion.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., introduced a similar bill in the
House.
   Other members of Congress on Wednesday proposed limiting deposit
insurance to $100,000 per individual depositor. The FDIC now
insures each account up to $100,000 with no limit on the number of
insured accounts a single depositor may have.
   In his testimony, Congressional Budget Office director Robert
Reischauer said he foresaw trouble for the FDIC fund if the
declining real estate values now plaguing the Northeast spread to
other parts of the country.

   Oil prices were higher in early trading here
today, following a strong performance in Europe where investors
responded to tight supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange late this morning, light
sweet crude was up 33 cents to $31.30 per barrel for October
delivery.
   Unleaded gasoline was up .66 cent to 94.50 cents per gallon on
October contracts, while home heating oil was up 1.76 cents to
84.35 cents on October contracts.
   Natural gas was trading at $1.545 per 1,000 cubic feet, up from
Wednesday's close of $1.543.
   Crude had opened up about 50 cents, then slacked off a bit on
the basis of a report that Iran might not help Iraq try to evade
international trade sanctions after all. On Wednesday, traders had
responded to news that Iran might trade food and medicine for Iraqi
oil, but Iranian officials were quoted today as saying that would
not happen.

   New Agriculture Department figures show net
U.S. farm income increased overall last year, but the gains were
limited to about two-thirds of the states.
   The department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday that
recovery from the 1988 drought varied according to region, with
Midwestern states showing the sharpest year-to-year increases
because they were hit so hard by the drought.
   Net farm income increased in 34 states, averaging 21.1 percent
higher than in 1988, the report said. The other 16 states showed a
decline averaging 9.8 percent.
   Nationwide, the increase was 10.7 percent.
   ``The states with the largest percentage increases were the ones
hit hardest by drought in 1988,'' a report said.
   ``North Dakota's net farm income rose by 75 percent from 1988 to
1989. Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota also registered
substantial increases.''
   The department's figures cover only farming operations and
exclude earnings from non-farm jobs held by family members.
   As defined by the agency, net farm income is the difference
between gross farm income and total expenses.
   ``Additions to inventories are treated as income,'' the report
said. ``Non-money items such as depreciation, the consumption of
farm-grown food, and the net imputed rental value of operator
dwellings are included.''
   Nationally, net farm income in 1989 was reported at $46.5
billion, up 10.7 percent from about $42 billion in 1988. This
year's may be in the range of $47 billion to $52 billion, analysts
said.
   California and Texas remained the top states in net farm income
last year, although each showed a decline from 1988. Florida
continued in third place.
   Kansas and Arkansas dropped from the top 10 and were replaced by
Wisconsin and Illinois in 1989.
   Regionally, states in the Corn Belt, Great Lakes and Northern
Plains generally rose in net farm income rankings, while the
Southeast, Appalachian and Mississippi Delta states tended to fall.
   Overall, the top 10 states accounted for $23.6 billion or 50.9
percent of U.S. net farm income, down from 53.5 percent in 1988,
the report said.

   There were indications today that a settlement
may be near in United Auto Workers union negotiations with General
Motors Corp., but both sides are quick to say that things could
unravel.
   The two sides are working against the midnight Friday expiration
of a labor contract covering 300,000 active GM workers. The
deadline is the same for contracts between the UAW and Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   In all, more than 450,000 active unionized workers are covered
by the three agreements.
   The UAW has scheduled a meeting of its GM bargaining council for
a suburban Detroit hotel on Monday. UAW local leaders and a
national union source said it was likely the meeting was called to
discuss tentative contract provisions.
   However, there still were two full days of bargaining left in
the life of the current agreement and the talks could sour during
that time, they said.
   This morning, a UAW official who didn't want to be identified
said progress was being made but unresolved issues included job
security, wages, pensions and health care. Tentative agreements
have been reached on a variety of matters, including health and
safety in factories and grievance procedures, he said.
   On Wednesday, UAW local leaders indicated the bargaining council
meeting was an indication of progress in the talks.
   ``Why would they call the meeting and why would they want us in
Detroit on Monday? Why would they want us in Detroit if nothing's
settled?'' asked Joe Garcia, secretary-treasurer of UAW Local 645
at GM's Van Nuys, Calif., car assembly plant.
   He said the meeting was set for the Hyatt Regency Hotel in
Dearborn. A hotel worker who did not identify himself confirmed
that the UAW had reserved rooms for a large meeting.
   A national UAW official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday that while such a meeting could be called to discuss
a strike, it was more likely that it would be used to describe
details of a tentative contract.
   Top-ranking UAW and GM executives met Wednesday morning to
discuss outstanding contract issues, said another UAW official, who
requested anonymity. He declined to say what the issues were, but
it was nearly certain that one of them was job security, the
union's pet issue in this set of talks.
   A GM statement said only that Chairman Robert Stempel and labor
Vice President Alfred Warren met with UAW President Owen Bieber and
Vice President Stephen Yokich, who is leading the union's
bargaining effort with GM.
   Before the union puts any tentative settlement up for a
ratification vote by its membership, leaders typically brief local
union presidents and bargaining committee chair people. Those
officials make up bargaining councils of the union's GM, Ford and
Chrysler departments.
   David Fenwick, president of UAW Local 933 in Indianapolis, also
said Wednesday he had been called to the Monday meeting of the GM
bargaining council.
   ``I don't see why they would schedule it (the meeting) for us on
the 17th if we were going out,'' Fenwick said. ``I would say they
must be very close. They must be calling us up there to inform us''
of contract terms.
   Earlier Wednesday, one of the UAW officials said talks were
``percolating'' after bogging down Monday principally over job
security.
   ``Things are moving,'' the official said.
   At GM, negotiators have been focusing on economic issues in the
final days of talks. UAW officials have said tentative agreements
have been reached on nearly all non-economic issues _ legal
assistance and military leave provisions for example.

   Southland Corp., owners of the 7-Eleven
convenience chain, extended its deadline Thursday for an offer to
exchange $1.8 billion in publicly held debt for a new package of
securities.
   This is the third extension of the offer, first announced in
March, as Southland tries to reduce its interest expense and raise
$430 million in new capital.
   The offer has been extended to Sept. 25. It was set to expire at
midnight Thursday. Southland said 50 percent to 95 percent of
different classes of bonds have been turned over.
   ``Over the past two weeks, we've succeeded in identifying the
vast majority of Southland security holders who have not yet
tendered their securities,'' said chief financial officer, Clark
Matthews. ``Over the next eight days we will intensify our efforts
to communicate with them, to explain the merits of the proposed
restructuring and to urge them to tender their securities.
   Under the exchange offers, Southland bondholders and preferred
stockholders are being offered new debt securities and about 25
percent of newly issued Southland common stock.
   Southland's Japanese partners, Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan
would purchase 70 percent of the stock for $430 million in cash.
The current owners, the Thompson family of Dallas, would retain a 5
percent stake in the recapitalized company.
   Southland incurred $4.9 billion in debt following a leveraged
buyout of the company on 1987.

<HEAD>Kodak Unveils New High-Speed Printing System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. on Thursday unveiled a
new printing system that will allow personal computer users to hook
up with high-speed printers traditionally reserved for mainframe
computers.
   The system, called Lionheart, will print documents up to nine
times faster than conventional desktop printers, the company said.
It will also allow users to get sets of finished reports _ sorted,
stapled and hole-punched _ without leaving their desks.
   ``There are lots of high-speed printers around, but the ability
to go directly from the PC to the printer is unique, the first in
the industry,'' said Charles L. Trowbridge, general manager of
Kodak's Copy Products Division.
   ``The magic is in the software and connection between the PC and
the system,'' he said.
   The system is priced at $250,000 and is targeted at the high end
of the business systems market, Trowbridge said.
   Trowbridge said the system will allow personal computer users to
get documents printed at speeds of up to 92 pages per minute,
compared to 8 to 10 pages per minute for standard desktop printers.
   The centerpiece of the new system is an Ektaprint high-speed
printer that has been on the market for several years.

   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., a newly formed
French-American company, plans to lay off 400 workers in France
through a combination of early retirement and payroll cutbacks, a
union said Thursday.
   The company declined to comment, but noted that its governing
board meets Friday in Paris. It plans a news conference next week.
   The Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail said the
company, created in July through the merger of Rhone-Poulenc's
human health division and Rorer Group Inc. of Pennsylvania, planned
cuts at a variety of sites. These included plants in Hauts-de-Seine
and Seine-Maritime, as well as six factories of the Propharm SA
unit.
   The union said two research centers would lose a total of 180
employees as part of a plan to transfer research programs to the
United States.
   Rhone-Poulenc has been divesting non-essential assets in an
attempt to offset the $2 billion cost of acquiring Rorer. Most
recently, the group sold its Spanish polyvinyl chloride business to
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, while a group of French banks
bought Rhone-Poulenc's headquarters.
   Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou told a news conference that asset
sales for all of 1990 could give the chemicals and pharmaceuticals
group up to 1.5 billion francs, or $282 million, in fresh cash.
   French stock analysts have questioned the timing of the Rorer
purchase, suggesting that a slowing U.S. economy will affect
anticipated earnings. The company also received a blow in August
from U.S. regulators, who ruled that a planned venture with Procter
&amp; Gamble Co. to distribute its over-the-counter pharmaceutical
products in the U.S. market violated antitrust regulations.

<TEXT>
   White House and congressional budget
bargainers are considering new taxes on cigarettes and petroleum
products as participants say they sense an approaching deal despite
daunting remaining obstacles.
   Negotiators began a seventh consecutive day of talks late this
morning cloistered at Andrews Air Force Base, just outside the
capital city in Maryland.
   They had worked until shortly after midnight as bargainers tried
to close in on a package of tax increases and spending cuts saving
$50 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and $500 billion by
1995.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said today he remained
optimistic about the talks, even though thorny disputes remain over
taxes and spending.
   ``There's no single issue that's holding it up,'' Foley told
reporters. ``There are a lot of tough issues. They're all
difficult.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
suggested that progress toward a budget breakthrough was hard to
assess at this time. ``Everybody wants to keep the pressure on.
We're still hopeful,'' Fitzwater said.
   On Wednesday, the negotiators tackled the question of whose
taxes will be increased. They already have agreed to raise taxes
and federal fees by $25 billion next year and $130 billion over the
next five years.
   Participants said they discussed boosting the 16-cents-per-pack
cigarette tax, perhaps doubling it, which would raise $2.8 billion
next year. They continued their efforts to agree to higher taxes on
alcoholic beverages, an idea both sides have suggested.
   In response, Anheuser-Busch, the nation's largest brewer of malt
beverages, has been running ``Can the Beer Tax'' advertisements.
Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, said
cigarette manufacturers have chosen a lower-profile effort against
any increase, contending that a rise in tobacco taxes would hurt
the poor disproportionately and cause job layoffs.
   White House budget chief Richard Darman suggested slapping a 1
percent tax on all petroleum-containing products except livestock
feed, one official said, a proposal that would cover items ranging
from gasoline to cosmetics. It would reap the government $800
million next year and $7 billion over five years.
   He also proposed a lower-cost version of a tax on luxury items
the Democrats have advanced. Goods subject to the levy under both
proposals include expensive cars, private planes and boats,
jewelry, furs and electronic equipment.
   But one of the thorniest remaining hurdles is also a tax
proposal: President Bush's proposal to lower the capital gains tax
rate. The levy is charged when property and other investments are
sold at a profit. Republicans say a cut would stimulate more sales
and thus bring in more tax revenue.
   But Democrats, complaining that the idea would merely fatten the
wallets of the rich, say they won't accept it without a proposal of
their own: a boost in income taxes on the wealthy. Republicans
reject that idea.
   The parties also remain at odds over spending totals for
domestic programs. GOP negotiators want domestic programs _ ranging
from benefit programs like Medicare to general government efforts
like road-building _ to be slashed by $130 billion over the next
five years. Democrats want to hold the reduction to $90 billion.
   ``We had to get to the tough questions, and now we're there,''
said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee.
   One further complication was added when New York's 34 members of
the House signed a letter promising to vote against any deal that
limits the deductibility on federal income taxes of state and local
income taxes.
   Officials from states with high income taxes, like New York,
fear that the idea _ under consideration by the bargainers _ would
make it harder for states to raise taxes in the future.
   ``It would kill New York,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
who circulated the letter. ``It would cause the exodus of many,
many people.''
   The negotiators have discussed boosting Medicare premiums for
better-off recipients. They also are nearing agreement on a deal to
limit next year's military budget to about $295 billion, $11
billion below the amount needed to keep up with inflation.
   Officials believe that the deficit will likely exceed $250
billion _ a record _ in the upcoming fiscal year unless something
is done. Without a budget agreement by Oct. 1, the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law will shrink the $1.2 trillion budget by $100
billion, an amount that would disrupt most federal programs.

   The Bush administration unveiled a revised
program today to ease the shortfall in oil, but Energy Secretary
James Watkins said worldwide shortages could linger at near 1
million barrels a day through the winter.
   Watkins said he believed the shortfall can be ``managed''
through conservation efforts and additional domestic production.
   He left open the possibility of drawing oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve in the coming months if conservation and
increased production efforts fall short of expectations. But he
reiterated it was too soon to use the reserve, which holds nearly
600 million barrels.
   ``That's a cherished reserve that has a finite life ... and we
don't want to use it too early,'' Watkins told the Senate Energy
and Natural Resource Committee. He said he was ``comfortable'' that
the department would be ready to take oil from the reserve in short
notice if needed.
   The department outlined a revised combined program of energy
conservation and oil production measures that officials said was
aimed at cutting the oil supply shortfall in the United States by
about 1.1 million barrels a day.
   The new program, including a radio advertising campaign urging
conservation, came amid increasing criticism that the
administration's efforts to ease the country's reliance on foreign
oil have been more rhetoric than substance.
   ``The president should give more than a speech. He should give
us a program,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Wednesday in response
to Bush's call for increased energy conservation in light of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Watkins rejected such criticsm, saying the administration's
efforts to increase production and get Americans to conserve oil
are ``substantive ... We do not think they are trivial.''
   Much of the department's program announced today mirrored the
response plan announced shortly after the Mideast crisis developed,
including calls on motorists to conserve fuel by properly inflating
tires and various measures to expand production from existing
domestic oil fields.
   But Watkins said as much as 165,000 barrels of day also could be
saved by fuel switching and urged that regulatory and other
barriers be eased to promote switching. He said there are 37
natural gas pipeline proposals awaiting federal or state approval.
   The plan also included tax incentives for oil and gas
production, expanded production from Alaska and opening the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration _ all proposals
announced previously.
   Watkins said current crude oil stocks were well above levels at
the same time last year, but he said there was a 3.6 million barrel
worldwide production shortfall in September and that the shortfall
was expected to be gradually reduced to about 1 million by next
January and slightly lower in the succeeding months.
   The United Nations economic embargo imposed on Iraq slashed
available production from Iraq and occupied Kuwait by 4 million
barrels a day.
   Addressing a joint session of Congress on the Middle East crisis
Tuesday night, Bush asked lawmakers to enact measures to increase
domestic oil and gas production and said conservation is
``essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible.''
   But environmentalists and some members of Congress say the
administration has been slow in developing an energy plan and is
giving only scant emphasis to energy conservation, while
emphasizing expanded drilling, possibly in environmentally
sensitive areas.
   ``Never once did he mention renewable energy,'' Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said of Bush's speech.
   But since returning from their August recess, members of
Congress also have been short on specific proposals. The exception
has been House and Senate legislation calling for dramatic
increases in automobile fuel economy.
   Legislation sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., would
require automakers to improve the average fuel economy of new cars
to 40 miles per gallon by 2001.
   On Wednesday, Bryan and other sponsors said the measure would
cut the demand for petroleum by 2.8 million barrels a day by the
turn of the century. But the White House has opposed the measure
and a recently circulated policy memo suggested that the president
likely would veto it.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell today against most major
currencies in trading in Europe amid fresh concerns that U.S.
interest rates will fall.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said aggressive dollar selling followed comments by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that if a credible U.S.
budget-deficit reduction accord is reached, the central bank might
encourage lower interest rates.
   Falling U.S. interest rates make the dollar less appealing to
foreigners, cutting their potential returns on dollar-denominated
investments.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 137.65 Japanese yen from
138.30 yen at Wednesday's close. It was the lowest closing level in
Tokyo since Aug. 3, 1989, when the dollar finished at 136.40 yen.
   Later, in London, the dollar fell to 137.25 yen. At midday in
New York, the dollar was quoted at 136.425 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8770 from $1.8650 late
Wednesday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8780.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.5740 German marks, down from 1.5860; 1.3130
Swiss francs, down from 1.3225; 5.2710 French francs, down from
5.3180; 1.7740 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7875; 1,174.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,184.25, and 1.1640 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1623.
   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York include: 1.5730
German marks, 1.30925 Swiss francs, 1,173.00 Italian lire and
1.16455 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $384.00 a troy ounce from
$381.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $383.40 an ounce
from $381.75 late Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.62
an ounce to $381.82.
   Silver bullion was unchanged in London at a late bid of $4.82 a
troy ounce.

   Financing difficulties brought on by debt have
delivered a blow to John C. Portman's reputation, but the Atlanta
architect-developer's lieutenants say obituaries are premature.
   Despite the recent series of emergency meetings with creditors
over Portman's unsecured loans, officials of The Portman Cos.
maintain their operation is strong and its ventures are moving full
steam ahead.
   ``We've been in business 30 years and will be in business 30
more. The financing on our major projects is firmly in place. There
is no threat to the concrete and steel buildings of the Portman
Companies,'' executive vice president Sam Williams said Wednesday,
following the latest session with creditors.
   Williams said the focus of the meetings is to create a pool of
collateral to back the company's unsecured loans - those that are
not supported by assets or other collateral. He said he expected an
agreement to be reached within two weeks.
   Williams said Portman has no intention of backing out of any of
his current projects, though some, notably a 60-story office tower
in downtown Atlanta, are going up under less than ideal
circumstances.
   The Atlanta venture, to be called One Peachtree Center and
designed as the tallest skyscraper in the South, has been launched
amid a period of rising vacancy rates in the city's office
buildings.
   Williams argued that the severity of the downtown office vacancy
situation has been inflated because most calculations have factored
in two other skyscraper projects that have since been abandoned.
   Another major Atlanta office building, 191 Peachtree Tower, is
under construction now and nearing completion. Williams contends
that the Portman project, currently in its early stages of
construction, will be in a prime position as the newest kid on the
block when it opens in 1991.
   ``In essence, we now have the market position of the only new
office tower in downtown Atlanta with space available,'' Williams
said. ``Real estate, like any other business, goes in cycles. ...
Who's to say what cycle we will be in in the third quarter of 1995?
Our crystal ball is not that good but we've been through real
estate storms before.''
   Portman, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has
been on the defensive before, though rarely for his business
acumen.
   His architectural style, marked by streamlined exteriors and
expansive indoor atriums, have tended to be popular among the
masses but maligned by critics, who accused Portman of building
urban fortresses.
   Portman has steadfastly defended his modernist architecture as
``for people and not things.''
   After building his Peachtree Center cluster of office towers,
hotels and trade marts in downtown Atlanta, Portman went on to
major projects in cities including New York, San Francisco and
Singapore.
   As the real estate market began to slump over the last three
years, however, Portman borrowed heavily and refinanced existing
projects to launch new ventures.
   Among his new developments are the $300 million One Peachtree
Center; the $155 million Inforum technology mart, which opened last
year in Atlanta; the $90 million San Francisco Fashion Center,
which opened during the summer; and the $195 million Shanghai
Center, an office-hotel-retail complex opening next month in China.
   Portman's operation is private and does not release financial
data, though his current debt load has been reported to be more
than $1.6 billion.
   He has been sued recently by DG Bank Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank for allegedly failing to make a $3 million loan
repayment. And on Sept. 1 he stopped making payments to one of his
main creditors, Equitable Life Assurances Society of the United
States, on a $332.6 million mortgage for his flagship Peachtree
Center complex in Atlanta.
   Williams said the company's problems are only with unsecured
creditors, who hold about 5 percent of the company's loans. A
spokesman for Equitable this week declined to comment on the talks
with Portman, though two other creditors, CitiBank and Swiss Bank
Corp., said ``positive progress'' was made at the latest meeting.
   The 65-year-old Portman has made some bold architectural and
business decisions during his career, but publicly has maintained a
reticent image. He makes few public appearances, except to announce
new developments.
   Yet the talks with creditors have made him a reluctant front
page item over the last month. It is a position, say some who are
close to Portman, that the businessman doesn't like.
   Insurance executive Jesse Hill Jr., a friend of Portman, charged
that much of the media coverage has been based on speculation and
has weakened Portman's position in negotiating with the bankers.
   ``The man is obviously restructuring his finances,'' said Hill,
president of Atlanta Life Insurance Co. ``He's in negotiations and
if somehow the press wouldn't give him this terrible beating, he
has the assets and under normal circumstances he could work it
out.''
   Hill said he was especially offended by those who have grouped
Portman with New York developer Donald Trump and other high-flying
1980s entrepreneurs whose debt-financed empires have taken a dive
in the new decade.
   ``There is some constant effort to compare John Portman to
Donald Trump,'' Hill said. ``Trump is no John Portman, and Portman
is no Trump.
   ``Portman is a Horatio Alger story. He didn't have a Rockefeller
Center - he built one. The man is in a class by himself.''
   B. Eugene Griessman, a professor in the college of management at
Portman's alma mater, Georgia Tech, profiled the
architect-developer for a 1987 book on achievers. He said it is
Portman's nature to brush aside such obstacles when he has his mind
set on a project.
   ``He's a risk taker. His next project is always his favorite,''
said Griessman.
   Williams said Portman's current problems stem from tightened
banking regulations that have followed the real estate slump and
the savings and loan crisis. Banks are requiring lenders to come up
with stronger backing for loans, he said.
   ``Almost every real estate company in America will have to deal
with it,'' he said.

   Economically speaking, this year will be
remembered for its summer. Until that time, business economists
thought they were dealing with a somewhat dull, understandable,
rather tragic but predictable year.
   Then, as July ended and August began, said David Seiders of the
National Association of Home Builders, ``all hell broke lose.'' A
rather unscientific description, but it comes close to describing
the sensation.
   First off, the Commerce Department went through three years of
statistics on gross national product, most basic of all economic
indicators, revised the numbers and revealed the economy really was
weaker than believed.
   For those who rely on such numbers, as professional economists
do, the news was traumatic. It was right after this that a slew of
brand new forecasts emerged from Wall Street, all mentioning the
likelihood of recession.
   Then came the July employment report, the first major indicator
of economic activity for the third quarter. It showed employment
falling and the jobless rate rising, particularly in manufacturing
and construction. Very bad news.
   Then Iraq invaded Kuwait, world energy prices leaped, inflation
fears rose, billions of dollars of value disappeared from stocks
and bonds, Congress was unable to reach a budget compromise, the
savings and loan crisis seemed to worsen each day, and the banking
situation was found to be almost as bad.
   The latest blow was the revelation by Charles Bowsher,
comptroller general of the General Accounting Office, that there
might be insufficient cash in the Bank Insurance Fund to pay
depositors of banks expected to fail.
   Bowsher told Congress, already trying to figure out how to
handle $130 billion in costs from bailing out savings and loan
associations, that 35 banks with $45.1 billion in assets would fold
this year.
   All this _ and, of course, additional billions of dollars to
support the military interdiction in the Mideast _ was presented
within two months to a nation and its Congress already at an
impasse over budget deficits.
   What happened this summer has changed every economic forecast of
business and government, and probably the spending plans of most
American households. While economic insecurity had been growing,
its pace has quickened.
   Household insecurity is greater after the sharp decline in
securities, the increase in energy prices, the slowdown in housing
and the deterioration of the job market.
   The latter is in far worse condition than indicated by the 5.6
percent jobless rate. Factory jobs fell by 45,000 in August,
bringing to 455,000 the number of such jobs lost since early last
year. Construction employment in some areas is in a depression;
employment fell by 40,000 in August.
   Now, according to Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, ``only health services and state and local
government are sustaining a strong pace of job creation,'' and that
suggests higher taxes.
   Perhaps the most pronounced attitudinal change resulting from
the negative news is a feeling that the economy mightn't be able to
stumble through problems as it has done before. Horizons have
shrunk; it is difficult to look far ahead.
   Those who have experienced such periods recognize, however, that
the picture can change remarkably fast; gloom can fade and hope can
bloom _ if, for example, Mideast problems were resolved.
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities,
agrees for example that the financial system is rotten, but says
it's not ``rotten to the core, and it's not too late to fix it.''
   And stock market guru James Dines wonders if stocks haven't
fallen so low that bargains might soon begin to appear. He has just
issued what he calls an ``interim warning bulletin'' entitled
``Approaching An Important Buy Signal?''
   But whether the economic news continues to worsen and the gloom
to deepen, or whether it takes a more positive turn, nobody is
likely to forget these past two months any more than they can
forget being mugged.

   The stock market lapsed into a slow but steady
decline today as investors braced for some expected negative news
on the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 13.12 points on
Wednesday, dropped 21.04 to 2,604.70 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 464 up, 869 down and
524 unchanged.
   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for August.
   Analysts expect the index, a measure of inflationary pressures
in the pipelines of the economy, to show a big jump as a result of
higher energy costs.
   Data on retail sales and industrial production for last month
are also slated to be issued before the market opening.
   Those figures, which will be flat or only slightly higher if
advance estimates are correct, stand to be closely watched as
potential gauges of whether a recession can be avoided.
   Losers among the blue chips included Digital Equipment, down 1~
at 59}; Eastman Kodak, down { at 41; Philip Morris, down { at 45,
and Exxon, down &lsqb; at 51\.
   Money-center bank stocks also were weak, coming under persistent
pressure following a poor reception for a sale of debt securities
by Chase Manhattan Corp. earlier this week.
   Chase shares dropped &rsqb; to 16}; Citicorp { to 17&lsqb;; Chemical
Banking { to 20~, and Bankamerica { to 21~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.01 to 176.08. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .74 at 322.45.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 84.23 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Here is a look at architect-developer John C.
Portman Jr., who is meeting with creditors over his company's debt:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PERSONAL: Born Dec. 4, 1924, in Walhalla, S.C., but grew up in
Atlanta. Opened his first architectural firm in Atlanta in 1956.
His first major project in the city was the Atlanta Merchandise
Mart in 1961.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS: Peachtree Center, a cluster of skyscraper
offices, hotels and trade marts in downtown Atlanta; the Marriott
Marquis in New York; the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco;
Marina Square in Singapore.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RECENT PROJECTS: Inforum, a $155 million technology mart opened
in Atlanta in 1989. The $90 million San Francisco Fashion Center
oened during the summer. The $195 million Shanghai Center, an
office-hotel-retail complex, is scheduled to open next month in
China. One Peachtree Center, a $300 million 60-story office
building that will be the latest addition to his Peachtree Center
complex, is under construction.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FINANCIAL PROBLEMS: Stem largely from Portman's use of debt and
refinancing of existing projects to help pay for his new ventures.
He reportedly has among his largest debts $378 million in loans
from Citicorp for One Peachtree Center, a $332.6 million mortgage
on Peachtree Center from a partnership of Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the United States and Nippon Life Insurance Co., and a
$130 million mortgage from Equitable on Inforum. Portman has been
meeting with creditors for more than a month to negotiate a plan to
settle his unsecured debt.

<HEAD>ABB to Buy Cincinnati Firm's Robot Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABB Robotics Inc. has signed a letter of
intent to buy the industrial robot business of Cincinnati Milacron
Inc., the two companies announced.
   The division includes a Greenwood, S.C., plant and its 200
employees. Cincinnati Milacron said Wednesday the transaction is
still subject to federal regulatory approval and is yet to be
finalized. The companies declined to reveal the sale price.
   ABB Robotics, based in New Berlin, Wis., is a worldwide supplier
of industrial robot systems. The company is part of the ABB Asea
Brown Boveri Group, headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.
   ABB Robotics said it plans to continue operating the industrial
robot business, fulfilling current contracts and providing customer
services. The company said it plans to retain a substantial number
of the division's employees.
   Cincinnati Milacron said the sale would have little effect on
1990 earnings.
   Daniel J. Meyer, Milacron's president and chief executive
officer, said his company is selling the business as part of a
reorganization to concentrate on core businesses, including
products for metalworking and plastics processing.
   ``Selling our robot business is a difficult decision, but we are
pleased to have found such a strong buyer,'' said Christopher C.
Cole, Milacron's group vice president for machine tool products.
   Cincinnati Milacron was an early developer of
computer-controlled industrial robots and has developed robotic
automation for industry. The company began research in industrial
robots in the 1960s and introduced its first model for commercial
sale in 1977.
   The company had 1989 sales of $851 million. Its products include
machine tools, plastics machinery, computer controls, grinding
wheels and metalworking fluids.

<HEAD>Deal On Offshore Oil Development to be Signed Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and provincial officials are expected to
announce a $5.2 billion ($4.4 billion U.S.) deal Friday to develop
the Hibernia oilfield off the coast of Newfoundland, the largest
offshore development in Canada and a boon for its poorest province.
   The project, which has been in the works for a decade, will go
after the estimated 522 million barrels of oil in the field 200
miles east of St. John's on the Grand Banks.
   Scheduled to appear at a news conference Friday in St. John's
are federal Trade Minister John Crosbie, Energy Minister Jake Epp,
Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells and provincial Energy Minister Rex
Gibbons.
   The federal government is providing $1 billion Canadian in cash
and $1.7 billion Canadian in loan guarantees to the project being
developed by Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., Chevron Canada Resources Ltd.,
Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. and Petro Canada.
   The Hibernia field represents about 5 percent of Canada's known
oil reserves and long has been touted as the savior of the
Newfoundland economy, which is based on the troubled fishing
industry. Hibernia is expected to produce 110,000 barrels of oil a
day for 20 years.
   ``I don't want to create the impression that it is going to turn
Newfoundland into an economic Shangri-La,'' Wells told the St.
John's Telegram. ``It is not.''
   The project is expected to provide up to 3,000 jobs during the
five-year construction period before production begins in 1996,
then 1,600 jobs during the 20-year life of the oilfield. That is
important to a province with a 17 percent unemployment rate.
   On Thursday, the government approved plans to develop the
Cohasset Panuke oilfield off the coast of Nova Scotia. That
project, scheduled to enter production in 1992, will produce 6
million barrels a year through 1997.

<HEAD>Fiat Subsidiary Agrees to Buy Stake in Spanish Truckmaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat Group's Iveco truck subsidiary has
agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in the state-owned Spanish truck
maker Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones SA, also known as Enasa, it
was announced Thursday.
   Spain's state holding company, National Institute of Industry,
selected the Italian company's offer over a bid from Daimler-Benz
AG of West Germany.
   Fiat's Iveco agreed to pay 1.2 billion pesetas, or about $12
million, in cash for the stake, according to the National
Institute's president, Jordi Mercader.
   He said Iveco also agreed to spend another 12 billion pesetas,
or $120 million, on buying new Enasa shares that will be offered in
January.
   Iveco, Europe's second-largest truckmaker after Daimler, will
have a six-year option to purchase the remaining 40 percent of
Enasa shares that remain under the National Institute's control, he
said.
   Mercader told Spanish National Radio that the state holding
company had accepted Fiat's offer because it was superior to that
made by Daimler.
   Mercader did not elaborate on the latest Daimler offer.
   ``This decision strengthens Enasa as it faces the tough times up
the road ahead,'' Mercader told national radio.
   A key part of the sale agreement includes Iveco guarantees for
all 5,700 current jobs at the company's three plants and Enasa's
top-line heavy truck brand name Pegaso.
   Attempts by National Institute of Industry officials to salvage
an earlier proposed sale to Daimler-Benz reportedly floundered on
the giant German truckmaker's insistence on more job cuts, state
subsidies and a plant closure.
   In a statement released in New York, Fiat said it hoped to take
steps to enable Enasa to broaden its product range in both light
and heavy vehicle markets and to become more competitive.
   ``This transaction is a further step in the internationalization
of Fiat Group after the recently-signed agreements with Ford
vis-a-vis the farm equipment business and Nippondenso for the joint
production of car air conditioners and heaters,'' Cesare Romiti,
president and chief executive of Fiat Group and chairman of Iveco.
   Last November, the Spanish government chose a joint bid by
Daimler-Benz and Man AG of West Germany to buy an 80 percent stake
in the Spanish company.
   In doing so, it passed over other offers by Fiat's Iveco,
Anglo-Dutch truckmaker DAF NV and AB Volvo of Sweden.
   But the Daimler-Man joint takeover collapsed last July. The
government subsequently sought to get Daimler to take a majority
stake alone or with another European partner or to entice Fiat to
come in.
   Enasa reported sales of more than 11,000 light and heavy trucks
last year and earned 240 million pesetas, or $2.47 million. It was
the first time Enasa had posted an annual profit in years.
   But analysts said the confusion this year over Enasa's future
owners and slowing demand for trucks has produced losses through
the first six months of 6 billion pesetas, or $60 million.
   The industrial vehicles division of Fiat preoduced 139,300
vehicles last year. Iveco had operating income of about $486
million on revenue of $6.4 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall On Bigger Corn Crop Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell across the
board Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by a sharp drop
in the corn market after the government raised its estimate of 1990
corn production.
   In a crop report released after Wednesday's close, the
Agriculture Department estimated the 1990 U.S. corn crop at 8.12
billion bushels, up 8 percent from last year's harvest and 3
percent more than the government's August forecast.
   The projection exceeded most analysts' expectations.
   The government left its soybean crop estimate unchanged at 1.84
billion bushels, as expected, which was initially considered
neutral for soybean prices.
   But some traders may have been unwilling to accept the USDA's
prediction for continued strong soymeal export demand and sold
contracts despite the report, said Anne Frick, senior oilseed
analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Other analysts said soybeans rallied earlier this week in
anticipation of the report, leaving the market vulnerable to
profit-taking.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3{ cents to 6} cents lowr with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.60 a bushel; corn was
5} cents to 8{ cents lower with September at $2.33\ a bushel; oats
were 2} cents to 5 cents lower with September at $1.07 a bushel;
soybeans were \ cent to 7 cents lower with September at $6.23 a
bushel.

   The stock market suffered a broad setback today
as investors braced for some expected negative news on the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 13.12 points on
Wednesday, dropped 36.14 to 2,589.60 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 416 up, 1,008 down
and 480 unchanged.
   The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer
price index of finished goods for August.
   Analysts expect the index, a measure of inflationary pressures
in the pipelines of the economy, to show a big jump as a result of
higher energy costs.
   Data on retail sales and industrial production for last month
are also slated to be issued before the market opening.
   Those figures, which will be flat or only slightly higher if
advance estimates are correct, stand to be closely watched as
potential gauges of whether a recession can be avoided.

<HEAD>Kodak Introduces New Printing System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. on Thursday introduced
a printing system that will let personal computer users hook up
with high-speed printers previously reserved for mainframes.
   The company billed the system, called Lionheart, as ``the most
dramatic advance in office productivity since the mouse.'' Industry
analysts were less effusive, in part because of the system's
$250,000 price tag.
   The system uses new software with an enhanced version of Kodak's
existing Ektaprint 1392 printer, which can print documents at
speeds of up to 92 pages per minute. Standard desktop printers turn
out about eight to 10 pages per minute.
   Users can also get sets of finished reports - sorted, stapled
and hole-punched - by selecting options at their desktop computer,
instead of filling out requests at their company's central copy
center.
   Charles L. Trowbridge, general manager of Kodak's Copy Products
Division, said Lionheart is the division's ``first step in a
transition to digital imaging in the office.''
   The system is targeted at companies that make or print 500,000
copies a month, such as government agencies and big law firms,
officials said.
   ``It doesn't sound like a really big deal to me,'' said industry
analyst Peter Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York. ``How many places are going to want to spend $250,000 a pop?
You have to have a heck of a lot of personal computers to make it
worthwhile.''
   ``I don't know if I would go so far as to say it's as big as the
mouse,'' said another analyst, B. Alex Henderson of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The 1392 is a very good printer.
But certainly you're not going to see one on every desktop.''
   Kodak plans to bring out other versions of Lionheart and other
digital products sometime in the next year, Trowbridge said.
   He said the company hopes to introduce its next new product in
early 1991.
   Introduction of the division's new line has already been delayed
several months. Enderlin said the latest expectation had been that
the new products would be out in October or November.
   Michael J. Murray, Kodak vice president and general manager of
marketing, said the Lionheart system is compatible with Ethernet,
IBM Token Ring and AppleTalk networks, and accepts electronic
floppy disk input.

<HEAD>CBOT Says It Will Fight Ferruzzi Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago Board of Trade officials announced plans
Thursday to fight two lawsuits they say seek to interfere with the
board's ability to protect the integrity of the market.
   Ferruzzi Group, an Italian company accused last year of trying
to corner the soybean futures market, filed a lawsuit Wednesday in
U.S. District Court seeking to block a Board of Trade disciplinary
hearing. The lawsuit said that the Board of Trade has a financial
stake in finding Ferruzzi at fault.
   Ferruzzi also has filed a $30 million lawsuit seeking damages
against the Board of Trade, accusing it of manipulating the market
and conspiring to force prices lower when it issued an order
forcing Ferruzzi to liquidate most of its soybean holdings.
   ``The CBOT will resist these lawsuits to the fullest extent of
the law,'' Board of Trade Chairman William F. O'Connor said
Thursday in a release. ``We will not permit them to interfere with
our responsibility to protect the integrity of the market through
our disciplinary process.''
   The Board of Trade's business conduct committee has a hearing
scheduled Monday to consider allegations that Ferruzzi tried to
manipulate the market in July 1989 and committed other violations.
   The Board of Trade issued an emergency order July 11, 1989,
directing all holders of July soybean contracts to liquidate their
positions down to 1 million bushels.
   ``Ferruzzi was the largest position holder in that market and
also held a clear majority of the soybeans that were deliverable on
that contract,'' said Mark Prout, a spokesman for the exchange.
   A situation like the one Prout described puts the squeeze on
other contract holders.
   Thomas R. Donovan, president of the exchange, said the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the General Accounting Office
conducted separate investigations of the emergency action and both
concluded that there were no conflicts of interest by the Board of
Trade.

   U.S. and Soviet trade officials said Thursday
they put the final touches on a maritime trade agreement signed by
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during the
June summit.
   Details of the agreement were worked out during a series of
meetings this week in New Orleans.
   ``I would like to stress that this is not a one-sided
agreement,'' said Vadim Kornelov, chief of foreign relations for
the Soviet Union's merchant marine ministry. ``One shouldn't think
that the Soviet Union due to this agreement is getting something
that American interests won't get from the Soviet Union.''
   Capt. Warren Leback, maritime administrator for the U.S.
Department of Transportation, said the agreement protects American
interests. It addresses U.S. shippers' concerns about Soviet ships'
new freedom to not only deliver goods to U.S. ports, but also pick
up cargo for delivery to Europe.
   ``We not see the predatory practices that occurred in the 70s
recurring in the 90s,'' he said.
   The agreement lasts five years beginning Oct. 1.

<HEAD>The Next Wave? Patenting Financial Innovations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine a certificate of deposit tied to the
price of oil _ or a new kind of junk bond. Now imagine that you own
the patent to such an innovation and everyone who wants to market
it is beating a path to your door and forking over big bucks.
   One Washington law firm thinks patenting financial innovations
may be the wave of the future in an era of financial uncertainty,
shrinking markets and global competition.
   The firm, Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, has issued a memorandum
to its clients suggesting patents could be ``the most promising
means for obtaining exclusive rights to a type of financial product
or service for a significant period of time.''
   But others in law and finance are skeptical. Noting that few
such patents have been secured in the past, they think the idea may
be patent nonsense.
   ``Our legal people indicate that it's very hard to patent or
copyright (financial products) and probably it wouldn't be
protected anyway, so I really haven't looked into it much more than
that,'' said American Stock Exchange Chairman James R. Jones.
   ``I see a lot of lawsuits proliferating from this,'' added John
Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, a
Washington-based trade association. ``Maybe there's a real reason
for it but at the moment it hasn't been demonstrated to me.''
   ``I think its a novel twist, but I'm not ready to say its a
major revolution yet,'' said Jack Coffee, a securities law expert
and professor at Columbia University's law school. Stressing that
his field is not patent law, Coffee added: ``This is the
intersecton of securities law and patent law and I'm not sure
either side understands the full dimensions of it.''
   Several government agencies and congressional offices have
expressed interest in reviewing the Sutherland, Asbill memo,
although no hearings or studies are planned.
   In his 26-page note, Peter Trzyna, an associate at Sutherland,
Asbill summarized the tools available for protecting financial
innovations, copyrights, patents and trademarks, and concluded that
all have strengths in certain circumstances. But he said patents,
while expensive and difficult to obtain, may be the most effective.
   A patent is the exclusive right to exclude others from making,
using or selling a device for 17 years, explained Oscar Mastin, a
spokesman for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which last year
issued a record 102,712 patents for all sorts of devices.
   He could not say how many financial patents have been applied
for in recent years because patent applications are confidential by
law. It takes about 18 months to obtain a patent after a review by
one of the government's 1,400 patent examiners.
   The cost ranges from $6,000 and $20,000 for filing and legal
fees, Sutherland, Asbill's memo estimated.
   ``Patents have the potential for causing the greatest
reverberations in the financial industry,'' the memo stated.
``Competitors could well find themselves foreclosed from marketing
a product or class of products for 17 years, or perhaps could do so
only by paying royalties under a license. Courts are not timid
about damage awards.''
   But obtaining a patent isn't simple, explained patent attorney
Thomas P. Dowling, of the New York firm Morgan &amp; Finnegan.
   ``You can't patent an idea. You have to patent a tangible,'' he
said.
   Dowling said a particular financial product can't be patented,
only the mechanical system that operates it or makes it different
from other products.
   Explained Dowling: ``Let's say there's a certificate of deposit
with a return that's indexed to the price of oil and somebody
starts to market the CD with some trade name as a means for hedging
against the inflationary effects of oil prices.
   ``Now if they come up with a novel and unobvious system for
creating that particular instrument, for maintaining it, for
providing access to the subscribers and all of the other back
office operations involved, they can get a patent on the system.''
   But he said that won't stop someone marketing a similar product
through a different system.
   Let's say someone patents a tamper-resistant automated teller
machine that uses a magnetic encoded strip to recognize customers'
bank cards, and someone else comes along with an ATM that reads
optical encoding, such as a hologram. The patent-holder of the
magnetic-strip system ``can't stop the second guy from also
providing ATM services but using a different technique,'' said
Dowling.
   So far, there have been few instances of financial service
companies obtaining patents for new products.
   One of the first was Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which patented its
Cash Management Account (CMA) in August 1982 and successfully
defended it against PaineWebber Inc.
   ``We have negotiated license fee arrangements with several of
our competitors,'' said Frank Macioce, assistant general counsel at
Merrill Lynch. He said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. agreed to pay a $1
million fee, while PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
have agreements that keep the amount they pay confidential, he said.
   Stephen B. Judlowe, the outside counsel who assisted Merrill
Lynch in patenting the CMA, said he has no explanation for why few
other firms have patented their new products. But he said, ``I
think you're going to see more of it rather than less.''

   Assets of the nation's 522 money market mutual

previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   Fund assets hit an all time high of $408.0 billion in the week

   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 255 general purpose funds rose $118.0 million to $143.8
billion, assets of 105 broker-dealer funds increased $608.2 million
to $165.57 billion, and assets of 162 institutional funds declined

Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in Holliston,
Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.48 percent from 7.49 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
47 days, up from 46 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.05 percent as of Wednesday from 6.06 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.02 percent from 5.03 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.69
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.71 the
previous week. Yields were 7.84 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.85 percent; 7.93 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.92 percent;
and 8.05 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from the previous week.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Sept. 3, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,316.4 billion from $3,303.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,103.4 billion from $4,092.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $820.0 billion from $815.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 5.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.9 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3.290.1 billion, a 2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4.078.6 billion, up 0.9 percent, while M1
rose 4.4 percent to an average of $812.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   - The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $427 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$760 million the previous week.

   Scandinavian Airlines System completed a $50
million deal Thursday that makes it the largest shareholder of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and puts Frank Lorenzo out as
Continental chairman.
   Lorenzo will get $30 million through the arrangement, approved a
day earlier by the Transportation Department, but a Continental
spokesman said the money is not all coming from the SAS purchase.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo's $30 million is paid out over a period of time
through the company,'' spokesman Art Kent said. ``It's not like
he's getting a lump sum.''
   SAS said it paid Lorenzo $17 million to buy out his employment
contract and to obtain vested options he had in Continental stock,
although Lorenzo retains options on 783,333 shares. Lorenzo remains
as a Continental director.
   As part of the deal, SAS purchased Jet Capital Corp., which
Lorenzo and partners used as a holding company for their shares of
Continental. SAS also bought 2.25 million newly issued shares of
Continental for $14 per share.
   Continental, based in Houston, Texas, and SAS, based in
Stockholm, Sweden, issued a joint statement Thursday evening that
also announced several appointments to the 15-member Continental
board.
   As previously announced, the former president of Delta Airlines,
Hollis L. Harris, of Atlanta, becomes president and chief executive
of Continental. Harris also joins the board.
   Long-time Continental director Carl Pohlad, of Minneapolis, was
elected chairman. Robert Garrett, of New York, was elected chairman
of the executive committee.
   SAS said it would appoint three members to the Continental
board, including Jan Carlzon, of Stockholm, president and chief
executive of SAS Group. The other SAS appointees are Lars Bergvall,
of Stockholm, chief operating officer of SAS; and Roberto Mendoza,
of New York, vice chairman of J.P. Morgan.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Upswing in Quality of U.S. Goods</HEAD>
<HEAD>By EVE EPSTEIN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The quality of U.S. manufactured goods is on the
rise, according to a Boston University study on manufacturing
competitiveness based on a survey of company executives.
   The good news for manufacturers is that the improvement rate on
the quality of goods has increased in the last two years. But the
report also found new product development and cost as possible
trouble spots on the U.S. manufacturing front.
   ``To get ahead of European and Japanese manufacturers, Americans
must hold strong on quality and improve on new product development
and cost,'' said Jeffrey Miller, a professor at Boston University's
School of Management
   Miller and Professor Jay Kim drew conclusions about
manufacturing based on surveys of nearly 200 executives of large
U.S. manufacturing firms. The study was released by the
Manufacturing Roundtable at Boston University.
   In the study, ``Beyond the Quality Revolution: U.S.
Manufacturing Strategy in the 1990s,'' researchers found that in
1989, quality improved at an annual rate of 7 percent over 1988.
However, cost and new product introduction time improved only 2{ to
3 percent per year over the two-year period.
   Kim said the survey found that more than half the respondents
start their process engineering activities after most of the
product engineering is finished.
   ``This results in longer lead time for new product development,
higher costs and missed opportunities in rapidly changing
markets,'' Kim said.
   The study found that American manufacturers do not view the
introduction of new products by competitors as a serious threat.
   Miller said that's a dangerous misperception. ``The nationwide
emphasis on quality, and the previous success of these firms in
improving it, may be distorting their perception of competitive
realities,'' he said.
   Work has begun on an international report to compare similar
data for Japan and Europe, Kim said.
   James Howell, an economist who runs his own consulting firm and
formerly worked as an economist for the Bank of Boston, said the
report may reflect the fact that manufacturers - as well as deans
of engineering schools - became concerned that other countries were
doing a better job of maintaining high quality.
   ``This is the area where the Japanese have been just beating our
pants off,'' Howell said.
   But he said there are better ways to gauge quality improvement
than asking manufacturing executives.
   ``You really should ask the production engineer on the floor who
is really trying to maintain quality production,'' Howell said.
   The survey asked executives to weigh a number of factors in
determining quality, including defect rates, liability and customer
satisfaction, Kim said. He said the numbers for quality improvement
are significant because executives gave their companies lower marks
for improvement in other areas.
   Still, Howell remained skeptical. ``No executive has ever found
anything wrong with his quality,'' Howell said.

<HEAD>Government Files Sentencing Report Under Seal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors filed a sentencing report Thursday
about financier Michael Milken that is believed to allege numerous
uncharged crimes, but it was not made public pending challenges
from the news media.
   An attorney for Milken said he would oppose release of the
papers before the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond
executive is sentenced on Oct. 1 for his guilty plea to six
securities and tax fraud counts.
   The sentencing memorandum reportedly contains details about
Milken's alleged conduct unearthed by the government but never made
public because of the plea agreement reached in April.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood gave attorneys for members of the
media until Monday to argue why the document should be released
before Milken is sentenced.
   Under the plea deal, Milken's lawyers agreed not to contest the
release of the sentencing memo or the inclusion of conduct outside
the plea. They can, however, seek to block release prior to the
date of sentencing.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said the government did
not object to releasing a version of the report before sentencing
but would delete references to unindicted co-conspirators and
confidential information related to an ongoing grand jury
investigation.
   The government normally does not release such memos, which
contain arguments for or against the severity of a sentence, until
the day of sentencing. Defense lawyers also can file a sentencing
report.
   Milken's lawyers are expected to oppose early release of the
report on the grounds that prejudicial publicity about Milken could
threaten his right to a fair sentencing. High public interest
generated by the case is one argument for early release.
   ``We want this case treated in terms of sentencing the way other
defendants are treated in this court and not different,'' Milken
attorney Martin Flumenbaum said at a hearing.
   ``There have always been high visibility cases in this court and
the practice (of withholding reports until sentencing) has been
invariably followed,'' he said. ''We bargained for it to be
publicly disclosed at the date of sentencing.''
   Richard Tofel, an attorney for Dow Jones &amp; Co., which owns The
Wall Street Journal, said he would file a motion arguing in favor
of early release. Flumenbaum was given until Wednesday to respond.
   Prosecutors said a version of the sentencing report deleting the
sensitive information could be prepared within 48 hours of a
judge's release order. Tofel said the newspaper would seek to have
the full report released publicly, either before or at sentencing.
   Earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval refused to
admit a sentencing report alleging that former Wall Street
arbitrager Robert Freeman committed 20 crimes in addition to a
single insider trading count he admitted.
   That is not an issue in this case because Milken's lawyers
agreed that the government could raise at sentencing conduct not
included in the plea deal.
   Milken faces up to 28 years in prison. He originally was
indicted in March 1989 on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in
the biggest securities fraud case in history.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Fall Broadly After USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and wheat futures prices fell as expected Thursday
following a government forecast for increasing supplies of those
grains, but a drop in the soybean market surprised some observers.
   On other commodity markets, crude oil futures rose slightly;
precious metals were mixed; cattle were mixed; and pork futures
retreated.
   Wheat futures settled 3\ cents to 7 cents lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in September at
$2.59} a bushel; corn was 5{ cents to 8{ cents lower with September
at $2.33\ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with
September at $1.07 a bushel; soybeans were 7\ cents lower to 1 cent
higher with September at $6.23 a bushel.
   In a crop report released after Wednesday's close, the
Agriculture Department estimated an 8 percent increase in U.S. corn
production this year to 8.12 billion bushels.
   The government also raised its projection for the nation's Aug.
31, 1991, corn stockpile to 1.38 billion bushels from last month's
estimate of 1.21 billion.
   Similarly, the USDA boosted its wheat production estimate to
2.76 billion bushels, 35 percent more han last year, and raised
its forecast for the May 31 wheat stockpile to 946 million bushels
from last month's projection of 846 million.
   Those unexpectedly big numbers explained Thursday's decline in
corn and wheat prices, analysts said.
   But soybean prices also slipped, despite the government's
forecast for a 5 percent decline in soybean production this year to
1.84 billion bushels and a reduction in the USDA's Aug. 31, 1991,
soybean stockpile projection to 200 million bushels from last
month's estimate of 225 million.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said some, but not all of Thursday's soybean
selling reflected an overflow of bearish sentiment from the
neighboring corn and wheat pits.
   She said additional pressure may have stemmed from skepticism
about the government's logic in predicting that a decline in the
amount of soybeans harvested in Brazil next spring will lead to an
increase in world consumption of U.S. soybeans during the 12 months
that began Sept. 1.
   ``A case could be made for a smaller Brazilian crop based on
lower plantings but the impact on U.S. usage from a smaller South
American crop would more likely be felt in the 1991-92 crop year,''
Frick said.
   Other analysts said traders who bought soybean contracts earlier
in the week in anticipation of a lower USDA forecast for Brazilian
soybean production took profits Thursday after the report confirmed
their expectations.
   Crude oil and heating oil futures rose but near-term gasoline
fell Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a lackluster
trading session muffled by a shortage of news from the Persian
Gulf.
   Light sweet crude oil settled unchanged to 38 cents higher with
October at $31.07 a barrel; heating oil was .89 cent to 1.27 cents
higher with October at 83.48 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.48 cent lower to .84 cent higher with October at 93.36 cents a
gallon.
   Gold futures edged higher while silver futures slipped on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 40 cents to 80 cents higher with September at
$382.90 a troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents to 3 cents lower with
September at $4.773 a troy ounce.
   Profit-taking pressured live cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange but feeder cattle advanced, helped by the drop
in corn prices.
   Hog futures retreated in line with weaker cash prices while pork
bellies succumbed to profit-taking after Wednesday's strong gains.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .37 cent lower with October at
78.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .60 cent
higher with September at 88.20 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .48 cent lower with October at 50.62 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to 1.6 cents lower with February
at 53 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Man Pleads Guilty in Counterfeit Computer Chip Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cincinnati man pleaded guilty Thursday to
federal charges that he made counterfeit computer chips and sold
them for half a million dollars.
   Dennis Wayne Hayes, 48, pleaded guilty to charges of money
laundering and criminal infringement of a copyright, among others,
said U.S. Attorney D. Michael Crites.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel released Hayes on a
$50,000 cash bond pending sentencing. Hayes faces up to 26 years in
prison and a $775,000 fine.
   The Internal Revenue Service said Hayes sold about 5,000 sets of
counterfeit Macintosh 128K ROM computer chips between 1988 and
1990, giving him gross receipts of about $500,000.
   The IRS and FBI said they began a joint investigation after
receiving information that Hayes was involved in illegally making
and selling computer chips, and was structuring large currency
transactions at Cincinnati-area banks in an apparent effort to
avoid currency transaction reporting requirements.
   Authorities said Hayes obtained cashier's checks at the banks
and had them made payable to a Swiss bank account.
   To counterfeit the chips, Hayes purchased blank chips and
removed the manufacturer's name. He then had the chips
silk-screened with the Apple Computer Inc. logo, copyright
information and parts numbers to make them appear genuine.
   Hayes sold the chips for $95 to $130 per set, federal
authorities said. Apple Computer does not authorize reproduction of
these chips.
   During a raid of Hayes' home, IRS and FBI agents said they
seized sophisticated computer and other electronic equipment, more
than $180,000 in cash, $2,000 in traveler's checks and weapons
including four Uzi semiautomatic guns. Hayes' Piper Comanche
airplane and a car were also seized.

<HEAD>Strikes Breaking Out at Canadian Paper Mills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A potentially nasty split is looming among
Canadian pulp and paper workers over whether to agree to
concessions or go on strike in hopes of a better contract offer.
   About 800 workers were off the job Thursday at a Canadian Forest
Proucts Ltd. mill in Dalhousie, New Brunswick, after rejecting an
offer which the union said followed the so-called pattern
settlement reached this summer with Stone-Consolidated Inc.
   CP Forest's largest mill in Gatineau, Quebec, was also shut down
by a strike. One local representing 1,105 workers at the Gatineau
mill voted against the offer while another local with 238 members
voted for the deal.
   But 1,100 workers at the company's plants in La Tuque, Quebec,
and Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, voted for the proposal and remained on
the job.
   ``It wasn't because we were satisfied, but we're in a recession
and the industry is in a slump,'' union local spokesman Pierre
Bellerive said in a telephone interview from Cap-de-la-Madeleine,
near Trois-Rivieres.
   ``People just didn't think it was the right time for a strike,''
he said.
   A spokesman for the Montreal-based Canadian Paperworkers Union
declined comment except to acknowledge ``we have a difficult
situation.''
   CP Forest is Canada's second largest producer of newsprint after
Abitibi-Price Inc. of Toronto, which has 3,800 workers on strike at
mills in Stephenville and Grand Falls in Newfoundland; Chandler,
Quebec; Iroquois Falls, Ontario; and three mills in Thunder Bay,
Ontario.
   Talks between Abitibi-Price and the union collapsed Tuesday and
union negotiators urged members to reject the company's offer.
   Abitibi-Price workers voted Thursday on the deal and results
were not yet known. In Beaupre, near Quebec City, however, the
450-member local at the Abitibi-Price plant has already accepted
the offer and is on the job.
   In the case of both companies, the sticking points with workers
have been demands to operate on two more statutory holidays in
return for premiums of up to five times the basic rate of pay, and
calls for greater flexibility in assigning skilled tradesmen.
   ``We're shutting down the mill because our members don't want to
give up anything on those issues,'' said Gilles Sabourin, a union
spokesman at the CP Forest mill in Gatineau.
   The union says allowing greater trade flexibility would cost
jobs.
   Those two concessions were the hallmark of the pattern agreement
reached earlier this summer with employees of Montreal-based
Stone-Consolidated. That agreement contained a 16.5 percent wage
increase over three years.
   Every three years, the union chooses a ``target company'' and
negotiates what is called the pattern settlement, which is supposed
to serve as the industry model.
   But this year, although the wage increase was seen as generous
by some industry observers in light of the plummeting profits of
paper plants, the pattern deal with Stone-Consolidated roused the
ire of workers elsewhere.
   The concessions proved so unpopular the union said it would back
any locals that wanted to fight them.
   Abitibi-Price says it has offered employees a 16.5 percent wage
increase over three years as well as all other gains negotiated by
the Stone-Consolidated mills.
   The average base rate for a mill worker is $15.37 ($13.25 U.S.)
an hour.
   Some industry analysts have predicted that any strike over
non-monetary issues would not last long.
   Separate negotiations are being conducted at CP Forest's plants
in Dryden and Thunder Bay. Workers at those two plants will be in a
strike position at the end of September, said a union spokesman.

<HEAD>Bass Thrift Acquisition Called Worst Ever for Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Robert Bass' purchase of a failed
California thrift is saving taxpayers money, a Bass associate said
Thursday, challenging a study's conclusion that the buyout was the
worst of the 1988 Southwest Plan bailouts.
   The study, prepared for the U.S. House Banking Committee,
suggests the government will end up paying $4.37 billion to bail
out the thrift, more than double original estimate of $1.7 billion,
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Thursday.
   The newspaper said investigators also concluded that it would
have been cheaper to liquidate American Savings and Loan
Association of Stockton at a cost of $3.3 billion than to pump
federal money into it.
   But Bass Group principal Bernie Carl, who was lead negotiator in
the thrift purchase, said that while the study was based on
accurate figures from when the thrift was sold in December 1988,
they have not been correctly interpreted.
   Also, Carl said, the $3.3 billion liquidation fee, while correct
at the time of the sale, would have ballooned to $4.4 billion had
the thrift actually been liquidated. In total, he estimated, it
would have cost the government $5 billion to liquidate the thrift.
   Jake Lewis, a staff member of the House Banking Committee, said
he would not address any specific figures or analysis of the study
until after a hering on it Friday.
   ``The best we can tell is that it is not any document from this
committee,'' Lewis said. ``We do have some staff analysis but we
have not made any release of any study from here.''
   Carl said American Savings was actually $1 billion deeper in
debt than estimated when regulators assessed the $3.3 billion
liquidation fee.
   ``The bank board didn't understand how deep the hole was, and
I'm not sure they could have,'' Carl said Thursday, breaking
longstanding policy not to comment on Bass dealings.
   After the sale, American Savings was divided into two financial
institutions: a healthy $15 billion-asset thrift named American
Savings Bank and a ``bad bank,'' called New West Federal Savings,
with a $22 billion portfolio of troubled assets.
   Carl said that under the Bass tenure, $14 billion in troubled
assets from New West have been liquidated at $700 million above the
appraised value, reducing the government's exposure to less than
$3.7 billion.
   If the remainder of the troubled portfolio is liquidated with
the same success, he said, the $700 million figure would climb to
approximately $1 billion.
   When the government's 30 percent share in American Savings is
considered, Carl said, the taxpayers' cost in the bailout is $1
billion lower than initially estimated.
   ``What these numbers really show is the deal didn't cost the
taxpayers $1 billion, it probably saved them that much,'' Carl
said.
   The study of 27 Southwest Plan deals was prepared for a Banking
Committee hearing Friday in Washington.
   Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, is reviewing the
deals made in 1988 under the Southwest Plan. He is focusing on
American Savings, as well as the deals behind Southwest Savings of
Dallas and First Gibraltar Bank.
   Gonzalez has characterized most of the 94 transactions involving
196 institutions as ``sweetheart'' deals that were overly generous
to wealthy investors and too costly to taxpayer. The overall cost
of the savings and loan bailout has been estimated at $500 billion.
   Carl claimed the hearing is designed to take the heat off
politicians and place it on those who bought insolvent banks.
   ``It's much easier to find a scapegoat than face up to the fact
that they created the thrift mess to start off with,'' he said.
   In an article this week, the publication American Banker termed
the American Savings purchase a possible prototype for future
government action. The publication lauded the deal, which involved
little federal assistance. Bass, of Fort Worth, pumped $400 million
into the thrift.

<HEAD>Ex-Money Manager Pleads Guilty in Insider Trading Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former money manager pleaded guilty Thursday
to trading on inside information about a pending merger that was
passed along by an attorney at a prestigious New York law firm.
   Peter H. Jeffer, 44, of Manhattan, pleaded guilty to one count
of wire fraud for purchasing 7,000 shares of stock in Spectro
Industries Inc. in April 1985 after receiving a tip from a
stockbroker.
   Jeffer faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine at
sentencing Jan. 4, 1991, before U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman
Cederbaum.
   The government alleged Jeffer received the information from
stockbroker Eben P. Smith, who in turn was tipped off by Steven L.
Glauberman, an attorney formerly with the law firm Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
   Glauberman, 39, of Manhattan, pleaded guilty Wednesday to two
counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. Smith, 41,
of Greenwich, Conn., faces criminal conspiracy and securities fraud
charges.
   In addition to Jeffer, whose money management firm Jeffer
Management Corp., now is defunct, Stanley P. Patrick of Old Lyme,
Conn., was charged criminally with making trades on information
from Smith.
   Glauberman was charged with leaking information about clients
involved in some well-known takeovers of the 1980s.
   The indictment alleges that Jeffer Management made $1.75 million
on transactions involving tips about pending mergers or takeovers
from Smith in several deals. Jeffer was charged only in connection
with the possible merger of Spectro Industries and McKesson Corp.

<HEAD>Salomon Brothers Executive Nominated To Head Industry Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top executive at the brokerage firm Salomon
Brothers Inc. was nominated Thursday as chairman of the securities
industry's leading trade group.
   Gedale B. Horowitz, 58, was tapped as the next head of the
Securities Industry Association in 1991, succeeding Robert N.
Downey, a partner with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   Horowitz is a former director and treasurer of the trade
association. His nomination is to be approved Nov. 30 at the SIA's
annual convention.
   SIA President Edward I. O'Brien said Horowitz's experience in
the industry and in Washington will be valuable ``because of the
many critical issues facing the industry, particularly at the
federal level.''
   Horowitz is in charge of government relations at Salomon, which
he joined in 1955 and became a general partner in 1967. He
currently is executive director of the brokerage and an executive
vice president and director of its parent company, Salomon Inc.
   Horowitz also is a past chairman of the Public Securities
Association, another industry trade group, and the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, which wrote the first rules for that
sector of the industry.

<HEAD>Dollar Slide Tied to Greenspan Comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar sank against all its major foreign
counterparts Thursday in a slide triggered by widespread
speculation about lower U.S. interest rates.
   Trading volume was heavy.
   ``The dollar came under intense pressure,'' said John McCarthy,
chief currency dealer at the Amsterdam Rtterdam Bank's office in
New York.``We saw a pretty substantial selloff. Volume was very,
very heavy. I would characterize it as brisk with a capital `B'.''
   The setback for the dollar came after Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan said that if a credible U.S. budget-deficit
reduction accord is reached between White House and Congressional
negotiators then the central bank would be inclined to relax its
monetary policy.
   An easing in Fed policy would lead to lower U.S. interest rates,
a development that would be bearish for the dollar.
   A decline in U.S. rates - especially after Japan pushed up its
rates - would make the dollar less appealing to investors because
it would reduce returns on dollar-denominated holdings.
   Many analysts have been urging the Fed to follow an easier
monetary policy to reinvigorate the failing economy.
   The dollar started its trading day in Tokyo by stumbling against
the Japanese yen. It fell in the Japanese capital to a closing
137.65 yen from 138.30 yen at Wednesday's close. It was the lowest
closing level in Tokyo since Aug. 3, 1989, when the dollar finished
at 136.40 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell to 137.25 yen. It continued to lose
ground in later New York dealings, ending the session at 136.25
yen, down from 138.075 yen late Wednesday.
   The dollar didn't fare any better against the German mark. It
tumbled to 1.5680 marks in late New York dealing from 1.5915 marks
late Wednesday. In European trading, the dollar was quoted at
1.5740 marks, down from Wednesday's late level of 1.5860.
   The British pound benefitted from the dollar's weakness. In
London, the pound rose to $1.8770 from $1.8650 late Wednesday. A
pound fetched $1.8825 late in New York, compared to $1.8590 a day
earlier.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late
quotes Wednesday, included: 1.3025 Swiss francs, down from 1.3290;
5.2520 French francs, down from 5.3303; 1,170.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,187.75; and 1.16175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16355.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared Wednesday's late
levels, were: 1.3130 Swiss francs, down from 1.3225; 5.2710 French
francs, down from 5.3180; 1.7740 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7875;
1,174.00 Italian lire, down from 1,184.25, and 1.1640 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1623.
   Gold prices posted modest gains on world markets.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
September delivery picked up 80 cents to settle at $382.90.
Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $384.00 an ounce,
$2.50 higher than Wednesday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $384.00 a troy ounce from
$381.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $383.40 an ounce
from $381.75 late Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.62
an ounce to $381.82.
   Silver had a mixed day. The metal fell on New York Comex with
the contract for September delivery closing at $4.773 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's settlement of $4.801. Silver bullion was
unchanged in London at a late bid of $4.82 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>GM Recalls School Buses, Vans for Fuel Hose Repair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is recalling 30,700 1990
vehicles, including 1,700 Chevrolet and GMC school buses, to repair
fuel hose connections that could break, the company said Thursday.
   The gasoline-powered school buses and about 29,000 Chevrolet
Astro and GMC Safari vans with 4.3-liter or 2.5-liter engines, may
have fuel-return hoses that could break at crimped couplings and
let fuel leak into the engine compartment, GM said.
   Fire could result if the fuel were ignited by hot engine parts,
GM said, though it said it hadn't been notified of any accidents or
injuries resulting from the problem.
   Owners of the vehicles are being notified by letter, and GM
dealers will install properly crimped fuel-return hoses at no
charge, the company said.

<HEAD>SEC Sues Five for Stock Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five people and three companies have been
charged in a $26 million stock fraud scheme, the Securities and
Exchange Commission announced Thursday.
   In a civil complaint, the SEC charged the defendants sold $57
million in unregistered securities, through a now defunct company
known as Governmental Financial Services. The governmnet said 800
investors bought the securities between 1983 and 1987. Before GFS
filed for bankruptcy law protection only $31 million had been paid
back to investors.
   The complaint, filed at federal court in Baltimore, alleged the
defendants were engaged in a ``Ponzi'' scheme. Investors were told
their money would go to buy equipment leases that furnish regular
income, when in fact the money was used to pay back earlier
investors.
   Those named in the complaint, filed Tuesday, were: GFS President
Charles A. Oglebay III, of Marlboro, Md.; Ralph E. McKittrick, Rye,
N.Y., a shareholder of GFS; Thomas L. Oglebay, Pleasant Town, Md.;
Harold M. Covert Jr., Allentown, Pa.; Glenn E. Dawson, Woodstock,
Md.
   Also named were three companies: McKittrick &amp; Briggs Securities
Inc., a New York-based brokerage; Harold M. Covert &amp; Associates
Inc., an Allentown, Pa., investment adviser and Reliance Leasing
Co., a New York company.
   Thomas Crowe, a Baltimore attorney who has represented Charles
Oglebay in the past, said he had not reviewed the complaint and
could not comment.

<HEAD>Hilton Says Tough Vegas Competition Will Cut Profits by Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. said Thursday it expects
its third-quarter profit to fall by 50 percent, mainly because
competition has kept gamblers away from the Las Vegas Hilton.
   The recently opened Excalibur and Mirage hotels have lured foot
traffic away from other hotels in Las Vegas. The Hilton has been
hurt particularly hard by the Mirage because both hotels cater to
well-heeled clients.
   ``It's more competitive for the high rolling business because of
the Mirage,'' said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst who follows
hotels for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ``The Mirage is
always full.''
   In the third quarter of 1989, Hilton earned $30.5 million, or 63
cents per share.

<HEAD>Former Chairman of Small Thrift Indicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of a small Los Angeles
savings and loan was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on
charges of using $1.24 million of the thrift's own money to help
buy a controlling interest in it.
   Oliver A. Trigg Jr. joined the board of Family Savings &amp; Loan
Association in 1986, bought 51 percent of its stock in August 1987
and resigned as chairman in May 1988 under pressure from
regulators.
   Trigg, 39, of Los Angeles, faces 15 counts of conspiracy, bank
fraud, tax fraud, money laundering and lying to federal regulators.
He has agreed to surrender and is scheduled for arraignment on
Sept. 14 before U.S. Magistrate Robert M. Stone, said the federal
prosecutor on the case, Maurice A. Leiter.
   Trigg intends to plead innocent and contest the charges, said
his lawyer, Arthur Barens. He said Trigg had cooperated fully with
the government and testified for several hours before the federal
grand jury about a year ago.
   Trigg faces a maximum prison sentence of 94 years and a fine of
up to $1 million.

<TEXT>
   Congress on Thursday extended for another four
years President Bush's authority to tap the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to stave off higher oil prices even though Bush
has not used it in the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait.
   The bill, which also would authorize increasing the size of the
reserve from 580 million to 1 billion barrels of oil, was approved
by the Senate on a voice vote and sent to the White House
   The House earlier passed the bill 391-0.
   Democrats have widely criticized Bush's refusal to draw upon the
reserve to moderate the 50 percent increase in crude prices since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August.
   The administration has said it will use the reserve only if
shortages develop, contending it was never intended to influence
prices - a contention some analysts dispute.
   A United Nations embargo against Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil has reduced
world supplies by about 4.3 million barrels, of which about 600,000
barrels went to the United States.
   The agreement from a House-Senate conference committee
reauthorizes the reserve through 1994. Without action,
authorization to operate the reserve would have expired on
Saturday.
   It also increases the amount of oil that the Energy Department
may purchase and store, from the current 750 million barrels to 1
billion barrels. The bill originally passed by the House extended
the authority but did not increase the size of the reserve.
   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a stockpile of crude oil
established in response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The oil is
stored in salt caverns along the Louisiana-Texas coast and has been
accumulated at a cost of more than $20 billion over the last
decade.
   The system, with its current actual stockpile of 580 million
barrels, could now replace 80 days of oil imports, according to
congressional committees, should it be needed in an oil emergency.
That cushion has fallen from 110 days in the middle 1980s because
of growing U.S. dependence on foreign crude.
   The measure also authorizes a test program for establishment of
a stockpile of refined oil products, such as gasoline and home
heating oil.
   Congress and the administration have battled over the last 18
months over whether to increase the reserve to 1 billion barrels.
President Bush has opposed increasing the reserve.

   Bernd Zabel says there are some things
he'll miss while he's gone from this world for two years: ``Going
to a Saturday night movie, going to a bar, having dinner. Having a
beer.''
   But all in all, the 41-year-old electrical engineer from Munich,
West Germany, won't mind forgoing such pleasures. For he'll be in
another, special world: a giant terrarium known as Biosphere II.
   His closest neighbors will be seven fellow environmental
pioneers, or ``biospherians,'' who will live with 3,800 varieties
of plants, animals and insects inside the 2{-acre glass-and-steel
dome designed to duplicate Earth's ecosystem.
   The $30 million privately funded Biosphere is a prototype for
sustaining life in space and and a laboratory for solving
environmental problems such as pollution.
   The world-within-the-world will consist of the crew members'
habitat plus six others: an agricultural area, desert, fresh and
saltwater marshes, ocean, savannah and rain forest.
   All food will be raised inside, from 150 crops rotated
seasonally to small goats, chickens, pigs and fish. Air, water and
wastes will be recycled.
   Only electricity will link the ecological system with the
outside. Computers and telephones will provide communications with
the rest of the world. Crew members will be able to leave via
airlocks in an emergency.
   The crew members, named Wednesday, have worked together for at
least three years on the project, which begins Dec. 5.
   ``I'm working five years toward the aim of the two-year closure,
and the closer the day comes, the more excited I get,'' said Zabel,
41, the crew captain.
   The other crew members, all single, are Abigail K. Alling, 31, a
marine biologist; Dr. Roy Walford, a gerontologist and nutritionist
and professor of pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine; Linda
Leigh, 38, scientific director; Sally Silverstone, 35; Taber K.
MacCallum, 26; Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, and Mark Van Thillo, 29.
   Poynter, of Surrey, England, said the biospherians have been
practicing their farming, and several also have learned how to
butcher animals. ``Nothing will be a surprise when we go in, in
terms of growing our own food,'' she said.
   Alling acknowledged that everyone involved with the project has
given some thought to the possibility that a crew member might go
stir-crazy in the Biosphere's confines.
   ``My response is, I've spent quite a lot of time at sea,''
including a stint on a research ship off Antarctica, she said.
