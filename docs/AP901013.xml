   Hurricane Lili and the remains of Tropical Storm Marco locked
pincers on the South on Friday with a combination of powerful
winds, heavy surf and drenching rains. At least 10 people have died
in the storms.
   Lili lurked off the shore of North Carolina, a weakling among
hurricanes, spinning harmless 8-foot waves into the Outer Banks.
Its winds were clocked at 75 mph - barely over the hurricane
threshhold of 74 mph.
   But the convergence of Lili and Marco, plus the dying remnants
of Tropical Storm Klaus, brought a third day of rain and dangerous
flooding to parts of the coastal Southeast.
   ``We got so much rain, so fast. ... We've never had anything
like this,'' said Pam Smith, director of the Richmond County
Emergency Management Agency in Augusta, Ga., whose west side was
swamped by floodwaters.
   In South Carolina, where floods Thursday carried caskets out of
a graveyard, state climatologist John Purvis said some places had
the most rainfall in a century.
   At the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.,
forecasters said Lili appeared to be veering to the north sooner
than expected, decreasing the threat of a direct hit on the
mid-Atlantic coast.
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Lili's center was at latitude 32.8 north and
72.3 longitude west, about 240 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras,
N.C. It was moving north-northwest at nearly 14 mph.
   ``It poses less threat to the East Coast now,'' said Herb White,
of the National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C. ``Now it's
projected to parallel the coast a little farther out.''
   Forecasters said gale-force winds could extend 75 miles inland
along the route of the storm.
   Tourists in North Carolina packed ferries to flee the Outer
Banks, although the most noticeable signs of the storm were waves
big enough to thrill surfers.
   ``I'm a little bit nervous, for my parents' sake,'' said Tom
Sherer, 18, of Coinjock, N.C., who was riding a skim board on the
waves. ``They're sort of worried.''
   ``Worried we're going to get hurt,'' added 16-year-old Mike
Vernon of Currituck, N.C.
   The real danger for the time being lay farther south, in
Georgia, where four people drowned in rising floodwaters that
ravaged the Augusta area. The floods were blamed on the remnants of
Tropical Storm Marco, which blew north out of the Gulf of Mexico on
Thursday.
   The victims included an 80-year-old man who drowned as he and
his wife struggled to leave their car at a flooded railroad track
north of Augusta. Coroner Thomas King said the man was swept away
in the floodwaters; his wife managed to escape.
   Three people drowned in Jefferson County, about 50 miles
southwest of Augusta, sheriff's Deputy Mark Williamson said.
   On Thursday, three people drowned in South Carolina, while one
person drowned and two died in storm-related traffic accidents in
North Carolina.
   In Augusta and surrounding Richmond County, officials closed all
roads and declared a state of emergency, Ms. Smith said.
   ``All of our roads are flooded,'' she said. ``People are trapped
in their homes. People are hollering out for help through their
windows. Some are on the rooftops. There are people in their cars
floating down the road.''
   Emergency officials began evacuating families in the Augusta
area early Friday morning.
   Ms. Smith estimated that several hundred people had been moved
from their flooded homes by boat or four-wheel-drive vehicles by
afternoon. About 100 had been taken to a shelter, and the remainder
stayed with friends or family, she said.
   An estimated 52,000 students missed classes as schools in three
counties closed. Augusta College canceled morning classes, and most
city and county government offices closed.
   At Appling, northwest of Augusta, 8.6 inches of rain was
measured during a 24-hour period.
   In western North Carolina, a rural one-lane bridge collapsed and
a mudslide squeezed traffic to one lane on a nearby highway north
of Lenoir. Authorities said no one was on the bridge when it
collapsed.
   Two emergency centers opened in Ashe County in northwestern
North Carolina Friday night, as streams and rivers overflowed their
banks, said Renee Hoffman of the state Division of Emergency
Management.

<HEAD>Honecker Haunts Germans Even After Unity</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.

<TEXT>
   Like an old ghost in a new house, Erich Honecker
is haunting the reunited Germans.
   Toppled from power a year ago, the 78-year-old former Communist
chief is confined to a Soviet military hospital near Berlin,
guarded by stone-faced soldiers.
   His health is the topic of nearly daily news reports, some
saying the ousted East German leader, who is suffering from kidney
cancer, is well enough to be imprisoned and others saying he is
not.
   As Germans forge their new country, many are demanding
punishment for despised members of the East Berlin regime that ran
the country into the ground. Honecker tops the list.
   ``I think most Germans would like to see Honecker go before a
court,'' said a spokeswoman for Berlin's justice department, Jutta
Burghart.
   Prosecutors have had plenty of opportunity to bring Honecker to
trial, having conducted investigations of deadly shootings at the
Berlin Wall, economic crimes and the harboring of terrorists during
his government.
   Berlin's chief justice, Jutta Limbach, hopes to decide ``within
a few weeks'' whether there is enough evidence to arrest the small,
slight man with steely eyes and a ramrod-straight posture.
   Even if the answer is yes, doctors will have to decide whether
Honecker is well enough to stand the rigors of Germany's customary
pre-trial detention.
   Any resulting indictment, trial and appeal could take years.
   All of this will keep Honecker's despised legacy alive almost
indefinitely.
   On Thursday, prosecutors in formerly Communist East Berlin
handed their western counterparts the files from the investigations
of Honecker and his cohorts.
   The Honecker files alone take up about 400 thick spiral ring
binders and a ``series of supplementary documents,'' officials
said.
   Their work has been hampered by the disarray of the documents.
   While Berlin officials look into the notorious shoot-to-kill
orders and economic crimes, a local prosecutor in the southwestern
city of Karlsruhe is pursuing his own investigation.
   Gerhard Klass has accused Honecker of obstruction of justice for
giving a safe haven to West Germany's most notorious terrorists.
   Germans are still furious that Honecker welcomed members of the
leftist Red Army Faction, and reportedly provided homes to Middle
East terrorists as well.
   There is a good chance the two criminal investigations will be
merged.
   Doctors in the former East Germany say Honecker can't stand the
rigors of prison. He spent one night in a crumbling, filthy jail
last January.
   Officials in the now-extinct country said it would have been an
``injustice'' to put the aging ex-dictator on trial during East
Germany's brief existence as a democracy.
   But those determinations will be reviewed by the new panels of
legal and medical experts.
   Honecker's 82-year-old former secret police chief, Erich Mielke,
is already in prison and targeted for the same Berlin investigation
aimed at his boss.
   A full color photo spread in this week's Stern magazine
documented the ailing Mielke's ambulance ride from an East Berlin
jail to one in the west.
   Will Honecker ever stand before a judge, ready to defend his 18
hard-line years in power or his masterminding of the Berlin Wall
construction in 1961?
   ``That will depend on the people who make the decision on his
health condition,'' prosecutor Klass said.
   Germany's news media have been following every twist and turn in
the case.
   Two days before the Oct. 3 unification, the mass-circulation
Bild newspaper ran a front-page picture of Honecker walking
jauntily and unaided near the Soviet hospital in Beelitz.
   Bild's blaring headline: ``Honecker - Really too Sick for the
Clink?''
   One open question is the ability of Germans to get their hands
on Honecker anytime soon, since he is in a Soviet compound.
   Prosecutor Klass jokingly says the Soviets could complicate
things by declaring Honecker an ``honorary colonel'' in the Red
Army, in an attempt to put him beyond the reach of German law.

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Require Parent Notification For Teenage Abortions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation approved by the Senate would bar
teenage girls from obtaining abortions at most hospitals unless at
least one of their parents was informed.
   The requirement, which still must go to the House, would cover
teen-age girls under the age of 18 who seek abortions at any
hospital that receives federal money.
   That covers virtually all hospitals, particularly public ones.
But abortions without notice still might be available at privately
run clinics that shun federal dollars.
   If enacted, the provision would be the first federal requirement
that parents be involved in abortion decisions by young people.
Many states have passed laws requiring notice or consent by a
parent or parents but some of them have been invalidated by court
decisions.
   The Senate approved the parental notice provision Friday as an
amendment to a big appropriations billcovering the departments of
Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.
   The notice requirement was sponsored by Sen. William Armstrong,
R-Colo., a fierce abortion opponent. It passed on a voice vote, but
only after opponents failed on a 48-48 tie vote to table, or kill,
the measure.
   The bill was approved on a 76-15 vote. It goes back to the
House, and probably will be sent to a conference committee to work
out differences on the notification provision and other amendments.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who led the fight against the
provision, argued that it was probably unconstitutional. He said it
lackdd a so-called ``judicial bypass'' that would allow an incest
victim, or others unable to discuss the subject with parents, to
seek a court's permission to obtain an abortion without notifying
one of her parents.
   ``This is just too, too rigid,'' Harkin said.
   Armstrong's amendment was added to a provision banning Medicaid
abortions for poor women, except when the life of the mother is
threatened or in cases of rape or incest.
   President Bush vetoed a similar spending bill last year because
he opposed allowing Medicaid abortions in any cases other than when
the mother's life is in danger.
   That abortion language has been the object of yearly
congressional battles. Abortion rights supporters won House passage
of the broader exemption for the first time last year, then fell 51
votes short of overriding Bush's veto.
   The Senate's latest version, covering spending in fiscal 1991,
would allow federal money for abortions in cases of rape and incest
that were ``reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public
health service.''
   Harkin's support for abortion rights is an issue in his
re-election battle this year against anti-abortion Republican Rep.
Tom Tauke.
   Armstrong, who is retiring from the Senate after this year,
argued that abortion was an ``extremely cruel, barbaric practice''
and ``intolerable in a civilized society.'' He acknowledged that
others disagree.
   ``I don't think young women should have an abortion without the
permission of one parent,'' Armstrong said. He stressed that his
provision requires notice - not consent - of one parent.
   Harkin said the effect would be to require notification for poor
girls, who can't afford private clinics, while permitting the
affluent to escape the restriction.
   ``What this amendment provides is a two-class system,'' Harkin
said. ``... The end result of this amendment is very cold and very
heartless.''
   The bill provides $183 billion in spending in fiscal 1991 for
HHS, as well as the departments of Labor and Education.
   It includes money to partially fund a bill approved earlier this
year to increase spending to combat AIDS and authorizing direct
assistance to cities hardest hit by the disease.
   The Senate tabled a pair of amendments sponsored by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., that would have cut AIDS spending.
   A measure adopted earlier this year authorized $600 million a
year in AIDS spending. But because of the budget problem, the
spending bill trimmed that figure to $159 million in fiscal 1991
and earmarks $441 million for the following year.

   Lawmakers are voicing concern that the level
of military spending approved by Congress in its budget resolution
is too high for a nation facing an economic crisis.
   ``This isn't about a war with the Russians. This isn't about a
war in the Middle East. This is about the economic survival of this
country,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., prior to House
approval Friday of a $268 billion defense bill.
   By a vote of 322-97, the House adopted a military spending bill
that cuts off production of the B-2 bomber at 15 planes and slashes
President Bush's budget request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   The House bill meets the level of defense spending worked out by
the House and Senate last week in a budget resolution seeking to
cut $500 billion from the federal deficit over the next five years.
   Final passage of the House measure didn't come, however, without
a stiff challenge to the spending level for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1.
   Earlier this week, the House Appropriations Committee added a
$5.3 billion package to the bill to meet the revised budget levels
approved by Congress.
   Liberal Democrats and a handful of Republicans sought to
eliminate the addition with a measure imposing a 2 percent
across-the-board cut on defense spending.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said the
levels set in the congressionally approved budget resolution were
ceilings, not floors, on spending. ``We can achieve better
savings,'' he said.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee on defense, warned that the cut would affect American
men and women who are stationed in the Persian Gulf region to stop
Iraqi aggression.
   Although the bill does not specifically address the cost of
Operation Desert Shield, expected to total $15 billion in fiscal
1991, sea lifts and projects such as the M-1 tank are key to the
U.S. buildup in the gulf.
   ``Anybody who thinks this does not affect them is wrong,''
Murtha said.
   The amendment to impose a 2 percent cut failed on a 215-201
vote.
   Following House approval in September of a defense authorization
bill that set spending ceilings, the legislation approved Friday
cuts Bush's proposal for SDI to $2.3 billion. He had requested $4.7
billion.
   The appropriations bill provides no production money for the
Pentagon's plan to place MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars.
Instead, the bill creates provides $618 million for the MX and
Midgetman land-based missiles.
   The spending plan calls for a cut of 77,000 U.S. troops
worldwide. The Bush administration has proposed a cut of 38,000
from the active duty troop total of 2.1 million.
   The Senate is expected to take up its version of the
appropriations bill next week. The package approved by the Senate
Appropriations Committee late Thursday is markedly different from
the House-approved legislation.
   The Senate committee bill trims about $1 billion from Bush's
budget request for SDI, funds the president's request for the B-2
bomber and cuts U.S. troop strength by 100,000.
   White House officials have said Bush would veto the House-passed
bill because of its wholesale cuts in his budget request for
strategic weapons.

<HEAD>Both Koreas Agree In Principle To Form Single Team For Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North and South Korea have agreed in
principle to form a single team for the 1992 Olympics and other
international sports events, news reports said Saturday.
   The national Yonhap News Agency said in a dispatch from
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that the agreement was reached
between South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong-sung and his North
Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, on Friday.
   Both officials agreed in principle to form a single Korean team
for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and the 41st World Table-tennis
Championships in Nagoya, Japan, in 1991, it said.
   Chung visited communist North Korea at the head of a South
Korean soccer team which had an exhibition match in the north's
capital of Pyongyang on Thursday. It marked the first sports
exchange between the two rival Korean states.
   Chung and the South Korean soccer team returned home Saturday
through the border village of Panmunjom, ending a five-day trip to
the north.
   The two Koreas, bitter rivals since the division of their
peninsula in 1945, have initiated talks on forming a single sports
team several times in the past but failed to reach agreement over
procedural and other matters.
   The friendly soccer match came several days before the prime
ministers of both Koreas are to meet in Pyongyang in a second round
of talks. The two ministers met in Seoul early last month in the
highest talks ever between the rival nations.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and
the capitalist south at the end of World War II in 1945. They
technically still remain at war since no peace treaty has been
signed since the 1950-53 Korean War.

   More than 200,000 U.S. troops now are arrayed
against Iraq, an increase of at least 25,000 from the Bush
administration's last official count, Pentagon sources said.
   The administration has refused to say exactly how many soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines are in Saudi Arabia or afloat in the
Red Sea, Persian Gulf and northern Arabian Sea. But sources said
Friday that the total has jumped above 200,000 with the arrival
this week of elements of two armored cavalry units.
   The sources spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Iraq has about 430,000 men in Kuwait and southern Iraq,
according to the Pentagon.
   Also on Friday, sources said a Marine amphibious force is
planning a practice assault on the Arabian coast soon as a trial
run for a possible U.S. invasion of Kuwait.
   In its last official count of U.S. forces in the gulf area, the
Defense Department said Thursday that ``more than 175,000'' are now
deployed. The department is expected to announce soon that the
total has risen by at least 25,000, sources said.
   In a sign that the gulf supply buildup is winding down, the
Pentagon announced that it was releasing from active duty an Army
Reserve unit that had been helping with port operations at
Beaumont, Texas. It said the 82 members of the 1192nd
Transportation Terminal Unit, stationed at New Orleans, will be
released Oct. 19.
   ``Its services are no longer required to support Operation
Desert Shield,'' the Pentagon said. The unit was called to active
duty on Aug. 27. Of the 259 reserve units from all services called
to active duty for Desert Shield, the 1192nd is the first to be
released.
   Among the latest forces to arrive in Saudi Arabia are elements
of the 1st Cavalry Division, which includes a brigade of the 2nd
Armored Division, from Fort Hood, Texas, and the 3rd Armored
Cavalry Regiment from Fort Bliss, Texas. Also attached to the 1st
Cavalry is the 13th Corps Support Command.
   Members of these units began arriving this week, meeting up with
their roughly 300 M1-Abrams tanks and other equipment, which was
shipped from their bases several weeks ago.
   Maj. Jesse Seigal, a spokesman at Fort Hood, said, ``We're in
the latter stages'' of deploying elements of the 1st Cavalry, the
2nd Armored and their support command. In their usual
configuration, that would include about 20,000 men. Seigal said he
could not say exactly how many were being deployed to Saudi Arabia.
   The 3rd Armored from Fort Bliss includes about 4,500 men.
   In a related development, a Pentagon source said the Marine
Corps was planning a training exercise to practice amphibious
landings on an Arabian beach. The dummy run will be similar to an
exercise Oct. 2 in which the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade
stormed a beach on the friendly shores of Oman, but the new
exercise will be held elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula, the
source said.
   About 45,000 Marines are depooyed in the gulf area.

   The Cincinnati Reds beat the Pittsburgh
Pirates 2-1 Friday in Game 6 of the National League Playoffs,
setting up a World Series match with the Oakland Athletics starting
Tuesday night.
   Winning pitcher Danny Jackson was just short of perfect for the
Reds, giving up one run and one hit in six-plus innings. Relievers
Norm Charlton and Randy Myers gave up no hits.
   Ron Oester, the remaining link to the Big Red Machine of the
1970s, led off the seventh inning with a single and advanced to
third on Billy Hatcher's single. In a surprising move, Manager Lou
Piniella then pinch-hit Luis Quinones for Paul O'Neill. Quinones
delivered with a single to drive in Oester.
   The Reds' first pennant since 1976 comes only a little more than
a year after former manager Pete Rose was banned from baseball for
gambling.

   The Senate Finance Committee approved a
bipartisan budget package early Saturday that would double gasoline
taxes and do nothing about tax rates on high incomes or capital
gains.
   The plan was approved on a 15-5 vote shortly after it was
endorsed by leaders of both parties. It is one of the more
middle-of-the-road budget packages of the several circulating on
Capitol Hill.
   ``I believe it is a fair compromise,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The plan would raise the federal gasoline tax from 9 cents per
gallon to 18.5 cents in three steps by 1992, raising $43 billion
over five years.
   Nine Democrats and six Republicans voted for the plan, while two
Democrats and three Republicans opposed it. The vote occurred
shortly after midnight.
   House Democrats were lining up behind a soak-the-rich
deficit-reduction plan that also would cut capital gains taxes for
middle-income families; House Republicans were drafting a rival
plan of their own.
   The House Democrats' plan put them at odds with President Bush,
who has said he would accept such a trade only if taxes on the
wealthiest Americans were raised less and capital-gains rates cut
more than the Democrats are proposing.
   An administration official following developments, speaking on
condition that his name not be used, said Bush could support the
Senate committee plan.
   The Senate Finance Committee plan would reduce Medicare spending
by $49 billion over the period. Of that, $17.6 billion would come
from increasing costs to the elderly and disabled in the program.
   An example of one higher cost would be a doubling of the $75
annual deductible for physicians' fees to $150 next year.
   Information made available by the source who provided details
did not include a total amount to be achieved for budget deficit
reduction through higher taxes and spending cuts.
   Like other plans, the Senate Finance Committee Package would
raise taxes on cigarettes by 8 cents to 24 cents a pack by 1993, on
liquor by $1.20 to $13.70 per gallon, on a six-pack of beer by 16
cents to 32 cents, on table win by 3 cents per bottle to 21 cents.
   People earning more than $100,000 would be ableonly 95
percent of tax deductions they would otherwise get, and wages
subject to the 1.45 percent tax for Medicare, levied in the Social
Security payroll tax, would rise from $51,300 to $89,000.
   The package also include $29.4 billion worth of tax breaks, the
bulk of them - $16.8 billion - for the poor through an increase in
the earned income tax credit. Most of the rest appeared to be for
business.
   The new plan by the House Democrats also would raise money by
delaying taxpayers' protection against ``bracket creep'' for a
year. However, unlike other plans under consideration, it would
include no increase in the tax on gasoline.
   Meanwhile, Republican House members squabbled among themselves
as they tried to come up with their own plan to find - before next
Friday's deadline - $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases
to reduce the federal deficit over the next five years.
   Bush, seemingly unruffled as frustration grew on Capitol Hill,
said he was confident a ``sound budget agreement'' could be found.
   ``Just stay calm - it will all work out,'' he said.
   Bush said Thursday he would accept an increase from 28 percent
to 31 percent in the tax rate of the highest-income Americans in
return for a deep cut in the rate on capital gains from sales of
stock, real estate and other investments. But he also said he
didn't think Congress would pass such a bill, and he declared he
would not accept the 33 percent top rate the House Democrats
propose.
   Republican members of the House were divided over whether to
fight any kind of tax increase or support Bush's call for a
deficit-cutting plan that includes some sort of higher taxes. There
was no conclusion, but the anti-tax group seemed to carry the day.
   ``We're developing a House Republican position,'' said Rep.
Mickey Edwards, R-Okla. ``We're not stating the position of the
president, nor are we stating what we think Democrats would vote
for.''
   GOP leaders were trying to piece a measure together, arguing
that Republicans need to unite around a proposal. But many
conservatives were insisting that unless the plan reflected bedrock
Republican principles - such as no tax increases of any kind - it
would be better to present nothing.
   ``If the alternative is going down in flames anyway, we ought to
put out a Republican, pro-growth, anti-tax agenda, not something
like Rostenkowski with a few less taxes,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas.
   The heart of a GOP plan under consideration would cut
capital-gains taxes and raise tax rates on the wealthy but still
produce a tax cut for the typical person with income above $200,000
a year.
   A surprise entry in the liberal proposal is a provision to forgo
next year's inflation adjustment to tax brackets. This would affect
taxpayers at all income levels, costing them $17.5 billion over the
next five years.
   The adjustment is designed to offset bracket creep, under which
inflation gradually pushes people into higher tax brackets when
they get cost-of-living pay raises. The annual adjustment in the
personal exemption also would be foregone but the standard
deduction would be increased as usual.
   Delaying bracket-creep protection allowed backers of the liberal
plan to eliminate a proposed 12-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline
taxes.
   The liberal plan would raise taxes $160 billion over the next
five years and reap $43 billion in savings from the Medicare
program. Only $10 billion of that Medicare saving would come from
beneficiaries.
   Well over half the tax increases in that proposal would come
from higher-income individuals. The biggest shot: raising the
maximum tax rate on the wealthiest people from 28 percent to 33
percent. The higher rate already is paid by some
upper-middle-income people.
   People with incomes over $1 million a year would face a 10
percent surtax.
   Also, workers would have to pay the 1.45 percent Medicare tax on
their first $100,000 of wages rather than $51,300 under current
law.
   To encourage saving, the plan would allow a person 25 or older
to escape taxation on half of $200,000 of certain capital gains in
a lifetime. These gains could include profits from the sale of such
investments as real estate, small businesses and timber - but not
corporate stock.
   In addition, a person with income up to $150,000 could exclude
another $1,000 of such gains each year.
   Other parts of the Democratic alternative include increased
taxes on alcoholic beverages, such as doubling the 16-cent tax on a
six-pack of beer; adding 8 cents to the cigarette tax; doubling the
gas-guzzler tax on new cars, and requiring state and local
government employees not covered by a public pension plan to join
the Social Security system.

successful singing careers, movie stardom and Warren Beatty.
   ``That was before Sonny. Warren has probably been with everybody
I know and unfortunately I was one of them,'' Cher said in the
November issue of Vanity Fair magazine.
   ``But since I was only 16, maybe I can get out of it with that.
I don't know if I was a bimbo then, but I had pretty low

<HEAD>Senate Seeks to Force Covert Cambodia Policy into the Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, in a sign of growing discontent
with America's proxy wars around the world, has approved a $20
million program for Cambodia designed to supplant the Bush
administration's covert aid to Cambodian rebels.
   ``It is ... healthy for us to provide this aid in this form,''
said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.
   ``This is a policy question that should not be discussed behind
closed doors,'' Boren said as the Senate adopted the program as
part of a 1991 foreign aid bill late Friday. ``It gives us an
opportunity to involve the American people in an open public
discussion of this matter.''
   Boren's committee voted in June to kill the $13 million U.S.
covert aid program that has provided military support for the
non-communist resistance groups fighting the Vietnamese-backed
communist government in Phnom Penh.
   The non-communist groups are fighting alongside the forces of
the Khmer Rouge, the infamous faction that was responsible for the
deaths of more than a million Cambodians during its four-year rule
in the late 1970s.
   While U.S. law bars the use of any aid to help the Khmer Rouge,
opponents of administration policy have charged that American
dollars are in fact doing just that, and Boren alluded to the
problem in supporting a policy change.
   ``There is a strong likelihood that in the past some of the
funds from the United States may have been used, directly or
indirectly, to benefit the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``It's time we
had restrictions that are enforceable.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, disclosed that
the United States has provided some 200 tons of excess Pentagon
supplies to the resistance since 1987, and noted that audits are
unable to trace the supplies to their ultimate users.
   ``There is an urgent need to improve accountability for U.S.
funds,'' Mitchell said.
   The House-passed version of the foreign aid bill includes only
$7 million in humanitarian aid to the resistance. The amendment the
Senate adopted Friday apparently combines that amount with the $13
million that had previously been provided secretly, and converts it
into a broader program of aid and development.
   Instead of being intended primarily to supplement U.S. military
aid, the new program would be designed to reinforce diplomatic
efforts now being led by the United Nations, Mitchell said. ``This
aid program will demonstrate the United States' commitment to a
political process.''
   Differences between the two versions still must be worked out
after the Senate bill wins final passage, probably sometime next
week.
   ``This is a step in the right direction,'' Boren said. ``It in
no way turns our backs on the non-communist resistance.... It opens
the doors to the possibility that we might provide support for a
broader spectrum of Cambodian society in need.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., reminded senators of the horrors many
fear if the Khmer Rouge - now the strongest militarily of the rebel
factions - ride U.S. aid back into power.
   ``This is the killing fields,'' Danforth said. ``The Khmer Rouge
are still an active organization with Pol Pot (their ruthless
leader) still in control. And their methods, if anything, have
become more sophisticated in their evil.''
   Defection from the administration's policy was yet another
example of discomfort on Capitol Hill with U.S. support for covert
wars waged by rebel groups in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Angola.
   At the same time it eliminated the covert money for Cambodian
rebels, the Senate voted to cut about $100 million off the
administration's $300 million request for the mujaheddin, the
rebels fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-installed government. And an
open debate is expected next week in the House about the $60
million covert aid program for UNITA, the guerilla movement
fighting Angola's Marxist government.
   With relations with the Soviet Union improving, much of the Cold
War rationale has disappeared for the conflicts, reducing them to
the status of small regional wars and lessening their importance to
members of Congress.

<HEAD>Researcher Says He's Solved Columbus Landfall Mystery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A university professor says he has
solved the ``wherewazit'' mystery of Christopher Columbus' first
step in the New World. Now comes the hard part - convincing other
historians.
   After four years of research, John Winslow says Columbus came
ashore 498 years ago Friday at Lignum Vitae Cay, part of the Berry
Islands in the northern Bahamas east of Miami.
   Historians agree Columbus landed somewhere in the Bahamas on
Oct. 12, 1492, during his first voyage to the New World, but in the
past 200 years, nine other islands have been proposed as the
landing site.
   ``You know what a whodunit is? This has been a wherewazit,''
Winslow said.
   Winslow, who specializes in historical geography, says he grew
interested in the explorer's landfall in 1986, when he was an
assistant chairman of social sciences at the College of the
Bahamas.
   He read theories on the two most accepted locations, San
Salvador, formerly named Watlings Island, and Samana Cay, but said
they did not adequately fit descriptions in Columbus' ``Diario'' of
the voyage.
   Columbus' original diary has been lost. A 1530s transcription
remains. Through the years, it has been translated various times
and at points is contradictory and vague.
   Winslow said he developed his theory on details from the journal
and other historical writings.
   He said freshly cut branches Columbus reported seeing shortly
before the land sighting would have been caught in the Antilles
current if they came from the Bahamas and disproves the two
accepted landfall sites.
   ``It's impossible for Samana Cay and San Salvador. Because (of
their location) the driftwood would have been on the other side of
the current,'' he said.
   Winslow said his is the only theory that places Columbus' stop
in Cuba at an area that matches the geographic descriptions
reported in his diary.
   ``I'm convinced that (Winslow is) an outstanding scholar and
thorough researcher,'' said George Daniels, chairman of the
department of history at the University of South Alabama. ``If he
believes he knows the correct route of Columbus, he has good reason
to believe that.''
   Winslow has to convince others who have spent years researching
their own theories and governments who have millions of tourism
dollars at stake.
   This week the landfall debate continues in Jamaica, where the
Society for the History of Discoveries is holding its annual
meeting. The society, which specializes in the history of
geographic exploration, does not endorse any theory.
   ``I rather doubt that (the landfall issue) will be resolved to
the satisfaction of everyone,'' said John Parker, a longtime
society member and curator of the James Ford Bell Library at the
University of Minnesota. ``It will be resolved to the satisfaction
of some people, but the contention will continue.''

<TEXT>
   The assassin's bullet and other forms of
political violence have been frequent methods of protest in Egypt
this century.
   Mostly the mayhem has been in the cause of Egyptian and Arab
nationalism or Islamic extremism. Moslem fanatics fired the bullets
that killed President Anwar Sadat and seven people with him on a
military reviewing stand in 1981.
   Since 1910, when a nationalist murdered Prime Minister Butros
Pacha Ghali, violence motivated by politics has killed at least 30
government ministers, prominent Egyptians and Britons, and ordinary
civilians.
   In 1985, a crazed Egyptian border police sergeant in the Sinai
slayed four Israeli children and three adults because he said they
spied for their government.
   Egyptian authorities said the latest slaying, the death Friday
of the Parliament speaker on a Cairo street, could have been
perpetrated either by nationalists or religious zealots.
   The Persian Gulf crisis also could have been the motivation,
because Egypt led Arab opposition to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   Authorities say Iraqi agents sent to cause turmoil could have
killed Rifaat el-Mahgoub, speaker of the People's Assembly and
second to President Hosni Mubarak in the official hierarchy, and
four security men.
   ``One possibility is an outside operation, but the gangs for
these operations are under control,'' said Interior Minister
Abdel-Halim Moussa.
   But when Moussa reported last week the arrest of more than 35
alleged terrorists sent by Iraq to assassinate and cause general
unrest, he admitted that others remained on the loose. He said they
would be caught, but no further arrests have been announced.
   The four assailants, who rode by on motorbikes when they killed
el-Mahgoub, also could have been ``our brothers of the Gamaat,''
Moussa said. The word, Arabic for ``groups,'' denotes
violence-prone Moslem activist organizations.
   It would be a great improvement in their effectiveness as
terrorists compared with other outings in recent years.
   Moslem extremists were blamed for a bomb ambush last year that
missed then-Interior Minister Zaki Badr. They shot at two former
interior ministers and a government magazine editor in 1987. Only
former Minister Abu Basha was hurt seriously.
   Moussa did not mention a third possibility: Egypt's Revolution.
The government claims to have destroyed that Arab nationalist
group. But the attack had some hallmarks of four of the group's
actions in the mid-1980s that killed two Israelis and left six
Israeli and American diplomats wounded.
   It also resembled in several ways an assault on an Israeli tour
bus last February by men speaking Arabic with Palestinian accents.
Nine people were killed.
   A roster of the century's assassination victims in Egypt shows a
diverse group.
   -Sixteen Israelis: They included people on the tour bus and two
staff members of Israel's Cairo embassy, the Jewish state's only
one in an Arab country.
   -Two British diplomats: Sir Lee Stack, governor-general of
Sudan, shot down by an Egyptian nationalist in 1924 with Egypt's
army commander; and Lord Moyne of the wealthy Irish Guinness
brewing clan, by Jewish terrorists in 1944.
   -Prime Minister Ghali and two other officials were shot for
collaborating with Egypt's British occupiers in the first half of
the century.
   -In 1948, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nokrashy, who doubled as
interior minister, fell to an assassin's bullet while waiting for
an elevator in the Interior Ministry.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, founded 20 years earlier
in Egypt, was blamed.
   In 1954, Brotherhood member Mahmoud Abdel-Latif fired at Gamal
Abdel Nasser, republican Egypt's first president, as he spoke from
the same Alexandria balcony where two years later he would proclaim
nationalization of the Suez Canal.
   The fusillade missed. Nasser, incensed, banned the organization,
had six members executed and arrested thousands, many of whom were
tortured.

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said public
resentment of government may lead to limits on the terms of members
of Congress.
   Oklahoma's vote last month to put 12-year limits on state
legislative terms was just the beginning, Quayle said in a speech
Friday to the Society of Professional Journalists.
   Similar ballot initiatives in Colorado and California are
expected to pass next month, Quayle said.
   ``Clearly, term limitation is an idea whose time has come. It
reflects a widespread condemnation of the current system. People
rightfully feel that entrenched legislators are only interested in
getting elected,'' the vice president said.
   ``I don't think that the movement to limit terms will stop at
the state level. I wouldn't be surprised to see Americans calling
to limit terms of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives
and the United States Senate, and I hope they do,'' he said.
   Quayle spoke scathingly of Congress, where he spent 12 years
representing Indiana in the House and Senate. The administration
has been trying to portray Congress as the obstacle to a budget
agreement and to deflect criticism heaped upon President Bush for
indecisiveness on taxes.
   Quayle said a ``congressional elite'' has emerged, bearing out
the founders' fears that ``life tenure would threaten our freedom
by creating a new ruling class.''
   Congress has exempted itself from its own laws on civil rights,
equal employment, ethics, privacy, equal pay and freedom of
information, Quayle said.
   ``In effect, Congress has created two classes of Americans:
those who make the laws and those who must obey the laws,'' Quayle
said.
   Bush, asked his view on the issue in a news conference on
Tuesday, was less definitive.
   The president noted that term limits were part of the Republican
Party platform in 1988, and said he was ``certainly not opposed to
it, I haven't decided exactly.''
   ``But whether I make that a prime mover in the political
campaign that lies ahead in the nex few weeks, I don't know.''
   ``But I think people want a change against the incumbents up
there on the hill,'' he said referring to Congress.

<HEAD>Quayles Ride Park Horses During Government Shutdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANASSAS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle and her daughter rode
National Park Service horses in Manassas National Battlefield Park
a week ago when the park was officially closed to the public in the
government shutdown.
   The park superintendent and the vice president's press spokesman
on Friday confirmed an account of the Oct. 6 visit that appeared in
the Fairfax Journal.
   The visit occurred when the 22-member park staff was furloughed,
as were many workers throughout the federal government. Three law
enforcement rangers were the only staff on duty, and they
accompanied Mrs. Quayle and her 11-year-old daughter, Corinne, said
park superintendent Ken Apschnikat.
   Apschnikat said he closed the main gates, the visitors center
and two parking lots, but otherwise made no attempt to keep people
out of the park about 25 miles southwest of Washington. The park is
the site of two famous Civil War battles.
   ``It would be very difficult to close the whole park, and I made
no attempt to,'' Apschnikat said.
   The 4,345-acre park is crisscrossed by several major highways.
Many visitors slipped under gates or climbed over fences. The
Quayles arrived through a back entrance.
   The Quayle family frequently visits the park to ride the nine
horses stabled there, which are normally reserved for the rangers.
   Dan Quayle's spokesman, David Beckwith, said he saw nothing
inappropriate in the visit to the park.
   Beckwith said, ``The horses weren't on furlough.''

<TEXT>
   The odds of the tense situation in the
Persian Gulf erupting into a full-scale war are about even, say
three former top government officials and the head of a major oil
company.
   James R. Schlesinger, a former defense secretary and one-time
CIA director, and Joseph J. Sisco, former undersecretary of state,
both said Friday that they considered the likelihood of Middle East
military action to be ``50-50.''
   Sol Linowitz, a former ambassador who worked on Middle East
peace negotiations and the Panama Canal treaty, suggested that he
believed the chances of war were ``60-40, not because there's no
alternative, but because we won't seriously have explored the
alternative.''
   ``I think we're finding now the sense - in Washington, certainly
- that we're moving inexorably toward military action, that we are
going to be faced with that ... '' Linowitz added.
   Mobile Corp. chairman Allen E. Murray said he was ``a little
more optimistic than the others,'' and suggested there is less than
a 50 percent chance of war.
   The four made their comments during a news conference after a
closed-door discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis with members of
the Business Council as the 100 leaders of the nation's top
corporations held their semiannual meeting at this mountain
retreat.
   Schlesinger, now senior adviser for Lehman Brothers, the New
York investment banking firm, said any military action would not be
short.
   ``A lot of people have used the metaphor the `six-day war,''' he
said. ``But almost every war ... has started with a prediction the
war would be short at the outset and those predictions have
regularly been belied.''
   Sisco, a partner in Sisco Associates in Washington, agreed,
adding: ``If it comes to the use of force, then both air power as
well as ground forces will be necessary so that any notion of a
four- or six-day scenario just is unrealistic.''
   Linowitz, now senior counsel for Coudert Brothers, urged fullest
exploration of ``a negotiated path ... to be sure there is not some
way we can get to where we want to be without going to war and
without compromising basic principles that led us to take this
action.''
   Meanwhile, panel members said the sanctions would remain in
place for several months while diplomatic efforts continue toward
an Iraqi pullout of Kuwait.
   ``One has to say realistically, however, there's absolutely no
indication on the part of (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein at this
time that he's interested in getting out, let alone on conditions
laid down'' by the Security Council, Sisco said.
   ``I myself see relatively little prospect that Saddam will
withdraw on our terms which is our diplomatic stance,'' Schlesinger
said. ``We're asking him to capitulate. That would be desirable but
not likely.''

<HEAD>Times Mirror Corrects Poll Figures on Republicans and Rich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research organization says a national poll
it took last month showed that 21 percent of the respondents, not
51 percent as reported, associated Republicans with ``rich,
powerful, moneyed interests.''
   A poll three years ago showed 18 percent making such an
association and the big jump to 51 percent in the poll by the Times
Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press was widely published and
frequently cited by political commentators.
   Times Mirror blamed the incorrect figure on a computing error.
   It said it also overstated the percentage of people who
spontaneously said they associated Republicanism with conservatism,
being business oriented and not being for the people.
   Scott Sowry, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said the party was certain that the apparent jump was an error.
   ``That's what we've been saying all along,'' Sowry said.

   A survey shows an increasing proportion of
unwanted births among women who have been married.
   The National Center for Health Statistics on Friday released its
National Survey of Family Growth, which showed that 10.3 percent of
the 1.6 million births to these women that occurred between 1983
and 1988 were unwanted at the time of conception. The random
sampling was weighted to represent the entire population.
   The proportion was 14.3 percent in a 1973 survey but had dropped
to 7.7 percent in 1982.
   The increase was most pronounced among women living below the
poverty line. From 1982-88, the proportion of births unwanted at
the time of conception among this group rose 74 percent - from 11.9
percent to 20.7 percent.
   Among women who had never been married, a quarter of the 2.5
million births from 1983-88 were unwanted at the time of
pregnancy.

<HEAD>Consumer Commission Moves to Ban Baby Bean Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission says it
has taken the first step to ban infant ``bean bag'' cushions
because of 30 reported cases of babies found dead on them.
   The decision was made public Friday, a day after the commission
voted to publish a notice of proposed rule making in which it will
seek public comments to help it develop an accurate definition of
the product.
   The cushions are filled with plastic foam beads or other
granular material that can conform to the body of an infant,
especially to the face, when the infant is placed stomach-downward.
   They have been promoted as resting or sleeping places for
infants or devices to prop them upright, but in at least 30 cases
have led to death through suffocation.
   The commission announced earlier this year an agreement with all
known manufacturers of the cushions to recall them and not produce
any more. The recalls, covering about a million cushions, are still
in effect.
   The commission said consumers who have not already returned
their infant cushions should stop using them, return to the store
or destroy them.
   Recall instructions can be obtained from a toll-free telephone
number, 1-800-638-2772. Most manufacturers have offered refunds.

<HEAD>Enema Kits Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major maker of barium enema kits is
recalling some products because they may be linked to severe
reactions, including nine deaths, from the common medical
procedure, federal officials said.
   E-Z-EM Inc. of Westbury, N.Y., sent recall notices to customers
a week ago, saying evidence suggests water-soluble proteins in
inflatable latex cuffs on the enema tips may be triggering the
reactions.
   The FDA has received 150 reports of allergic reactions related
to barium enema procedures in 1989 and 1990, FDA spokeswoman Susan
Cruzan said Friday. In nine cases, the patient died, she said.
   The company makes 85 percent to 90 percent of the kits, which
are used to diagnose disorders of the intestines.
   About 8 million to 10 million barium enemas are performed
annually, Cruzan said.
   The reports have been related to the company's enema kits with
inflatable latex cuffs.
   Company officials did not return a telephone call for comment.
   In light of the reports, the FDA asked radiologists and other
health professionals to report any adverse reactions related to
barium enema procedures that have occurred in the past 12 months.
   The procedure involves injecting a barium-containing fluid into
the rectum and colon, which enables these organs to show up on an
X-ray.
   In some cases, the reactions occurred after the enema tip had
been inserted, but before the barium had been introduced, the FDA
said.
   The FDA said the cause of the problem is still unclear.

   Biggles the terrier was headed for a reunion with
his owner after two harrowing months as a hostage in Kuwait and a
daring desert escape.
   He was scheduled to fly today from London to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, where he was headed on Aug. 2 when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The Iraqis had refused a British Airways request to allow the
dog to leave, said an airline spokesman.
   If dogs could talk, the lively bundle of white fur would have
quite a tale to tell his owner, identified by British Airways only
as A.J. Higginson, a Briton who works for the Malaysian Petroleum
Company.
   A British Airways spokesman on Friday did Biggles' talking for
him, as the 5-month-old West Highland terrier yapped and played at
the Heathrow Airport quarantine station.
   He was stranded in the cargo hold of British Airways Flight 149
which landed at Kuwait City airport on Aug. 2 and was unable to
leave because of the Iraqi invasion.
   The 367 passengers and crew were taken away to nearby hotels but
the terrier was left in the main cargo hold without food or water,
said the airline spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in
line with official practice.
   A few days later, several British crew members were allowed to
return to the aircraft to collect supplies and remembered that
Biggles was still in the cargo hold. To their amazement, he was
still alive, though badly dehydrated.
   ``We are not sure exactly how long he was in there before he was
rescued but he was very lucky to survive,'' said the British
Airways spokesman.
   The crew members took the terrier back to their hotel in Kuwait
where he was named Biggles after the fictional 1930s pilot whose
stories by W.E. Johns thrilled British school boys between the
wars.
   The crew, moved to Baghdad, cared for Biggles until they heard
of someone planning to flee from Iraq by land into Jordan, the
spokesman said.
   Biggles' unnamed benefactor smuggled him across the border into
Jordan on Monday and he was turned over to British Airways staff at
Amman Airport who arranged to fly him to London, the spokesman
said.

   A television cameraman said he smashed through a
glass window at a city gallery in the hope of chatting about art
with a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Simon Reynolds pleaded guilty Friday at London's Clerkenwell
magistrate's court to damaging a window at the art gallery where
Lady Helen Windsor works. She is the 26-year-old daughter of the
Duke of Kent.
   ``I am not infatuated with her,'' Reynolds, a 35-year-old
freelance cameraman, told the court. ``I just wanted to talk with
her about conceptual art.''
   He said he made six visits to the West End gallery and tried to
phone Miss Windsor before his break-in on Oct. 5, when he scuffled
with gallery personnel and finally broke a basement window to reach
Miss Windsor. Once inside, he simply waite for police to arrive.
   He was released on bail until Nov. 4, when Magistrate Michael
Johnstone will decide whether to send Reynolds to jail.

<HEAD>New Question: Will Drug Question Resurface?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police association wants the candidates
in the Texas governor's race to release detailed medical records.
   The Houston Police Officers Association's made the request
Friday. Democrat Ann Richards blamed the request on Republican
Clayton Williams.
   The Republican's campaign said he didn't instigate it.
   Richards campaign spokesman Glenn Smith said she released all
the medical records necessary when questions about possible drug
use came up during the Democratic primary election.
   Her refusal to say ``yes'' or ``no'' when asked if she had ever
used illegal drugs dogged her in that race.
   Richards, a recovering alcoholic, said then that answering such
a question might discourage others from seeking treatment.
   Williams, angry over Richards' bid to link his Midland bank to a
Houston drug money laundering probe, told reporters at a campaign
stop that he might resurrect the drug question.

   A candidate for the state House was
charged with criminal trespassing after he campaigned door-to-door
at a condominium complex with a ``no soliciting'' policy.
   Jonathan Spodnick, 27, was released on a written promise to
appear in court for arraignment next Thursday.
   The Bridgeport lawyer is the Democratic candidate for the House
seat held by House Minority Leader Robert G. Jaekle. Jaekle is
vacating the seat to run for lieutenant governor with Republican
gubernatorial candidate John G. Rowland.
   According to police reports, a resident told Spodnick of ``no
soliciting'' signs posted at the complex, but the candidate
continued going door-to-door while campaigning Wednesday evening.
   Police reports said when authorities asked Spodnick to leave the
complex, he refused.
   Spodnick said in a prepared statement that he was unaware
soliciting was not permitted in the complex. But he also said he
didn't believe political campaigning constituted soliciting.
   ``I am amazed that (the complex) would prohibit candidates from
going door-to-door, meeting those persons whom they will

   A parliamentary committee has proposed
ending compulsory military service and allowing any conscript to do
volunteer civilian work instead, the nation's largest daily
newspaper reported.
   Spokesmen for the Defense Committee confirmed a proposal on
military conscription would be made public Tuesday but refused to
comment on it.
   All Swedish males over 18 years old are now required to serve
seven to 15 months in the military. Those accepted as conscientious
objectors may do volunteer work.
   The daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter said Friday that some
legislators believe the current law is unfair because it accepts
some people as conscientious objectors but jails others who refuse
military service.
   About 50,000 youths are drafted each year. Of these, only 2,000
to 3,000 are allowed to engage in alternative service for moral or
other reasons, Dagens Nyheter said.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves Middle-Of-Road Budget Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee approved a
middle-of-the-road budget-cutting plan early today that raises some
taxes on the wealthy and boosts the levy on gasoline.
   The panel adopted the plan on a bipartisan 15-5 vote, leaving
the Senate in sharp contrast with the more fractious House.
   In that chamber, Democrats have endorsed a liberal package
containing sharper tax increases for the wealthy. Republicans are
torn between a more conservative proposal bearing President Bush's
plan to cut the capital gains tax, or perhaps offering nothing at
all.
   ``I believe it is a fair compromise,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, just before the post-midnight
Finance panel vote.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., called the plan ``right
and necessary,'' and predicted its approval by the full Senate. A
Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the president could support the measure.
   The proposal is the latest congressional attempt to fashion $500
billion in tax boosts and spending slashes for the next five years.
   Bush has demanded that lawmakers send him a deficit-reduction
package by next Friday. If they do not, he has threatened to allow
the government to close down once again the next day, when its
legal authority to spend money will expire.
   The president, whose wavering stance on the question of boosting
taxes on the rich has sparked frustration and ridicule on Capitol
Hill, expressed confidence that a plan will be hammered together.
   ``Just stay calm - it will all work out,'' he said.
   But there are so many different proposals in Congress that it is
difficult to foretell what the package will look like.
   Each plan contains common elements such as higher taxes on
alcohol, tobacco and luxury items such as expensive automobiles.
They would pare the growth of defense spending by close to $200
billion over the next five years, and limit increases in Medicare
by varying amounts.
   But from there, the plans differ.
   The Senate Finance proposal would limit income-tax deductions
for people who earn more than $100,000 per year. It would apply the
1.45 percent Medicare tax to earnings of up to $89,000, rather than
the current $51,300.
   It would boost the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to 18.5 cents
by 1992. And it would raise the $75 deductible Medicare
beneficiaries pay for doctors' bills to $150.
   The new plan by the House Democrats would raise the income-tax
rate the richest Americans pay from 28 percent to 33 percent, an
increase Bush has promised to veto.
   It would also raise money by delaying for one year the usual
adjustment of tax brackets forinflation. This provision would hurt
taxpayers of all incomes. However, unlike other plans under
consideration, it would include no increase in the tax on gasoline.
   House Republicans debated a plan that would raise the tax rate
on the wealthiest Americans to 31 percent, while cutting the
capital gains tax rate to 15 percent. The capital gains tax -
applied to sales of property like real estate - is now treated like
other income, with a top rate of 33 percent.
   House Democrats said their plan put a fair share of the
deficit-reduction burden on the wealthy.
   ``You're seeing the difference between the Democratic Party and
what they want to do, and the Republican Party and what they want
to protect,'' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   But conservative Republicans insisted that they were concerned
not with protecting the rich but with fostering economic growth.
   ``The Republican Party for 10 years has been united around the
concept of growth,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.
   The full House Ways and Means Committee endorsed a compromise
plan earlier in the week that left tax rates on the wealthy alone
and raised the gasoline tax by 9 cents per gallon.
   At this morning's Senate Finance Committee session, voting for
the compromise package were Mitchell; Dole; committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.; David Boren,
D-Okla.; David Pryor, D-Ark.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; John D.
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.; Tom Daschle, D-S.D.; John Breaux, D-La.
   Also, Sens. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.; John Danforth, R-Mo.; John
Chafee, R-R.I.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; and David Durenberger, R-Minn.
   Opposing the plan were Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.; William Roth, R-Del.; William Armstrong, R-Colo.; and Steve
Symms, R-Idaho.

   Cuba is withdrawing its 50,000 troops from

   The Cubans are leaving under a regional peace accord brokered by
the United States. Under the agreement, South Africa also gave up
control of Namibia.
   The Cubans have backed the Marxist government of Angola in its
battle with rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence

<TEXT>
   Under heavy bombardment, rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun fled the presidential palace to the French Embassy
Saturday and ordered his troops to surrender, ending a nearly
two-year rebellion.
   ``I ask my chiefs of staff to take their orders henceforth from
Gen. Emile Lahoud,'' Aoun said in a brief address to his 15,000
mainly Christian troops broadcast by his radio station.
   Lahoud commands Hrawi's 20,000 mainly Moslem army, which teamed
up with thousands of Syrians troops and hundreds of tanks in a
three-pronged ground assault on Aoun's enclave in Lebanon's
Cristian heartland.
   The attack was spearheaded by two hours of Syrian air and
artillery bombardment of the presidential palace east of Beirut,
where Aoun had his headquarters.
   Aoun fled to the French Embassy and first called for a
cease-fire. The government of President Elias Hrawi, whose army is
backed by an estimated 40,000 Syrian troops, demanded his
surrender.
   The attack came hours after an assassination attempt against
Aoun.
   Aoun had considered himself the legitimate authority in Lebanon
since September 1988, when he was appointed a caretaker prime
minister by outgoing President Amin Gemayel.
   Hrawi was elected president Nov. 24 to implement an Arab
League-brokered peace plan endorsed by Parliament to end 15 years
of civil war. He then sacked Aoun as army chief and interim prime
minister.
   Aoun has rejected the peace accord because it does not contain
guarantees for a complete Syrian military withdrawal. The Syrians
have had troops in Lebanon since 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   The peace accord provides for sharing political power equally
between Moslems and Christians, ending the traditional dominance of
the Maronite Catholics, the main Christian sect. Aoun and Hrawi are
both Maronites.

   A woman on the way to a birthing center had

   ``It didn't register with my husband. ... He finally turned on

traveling to a midwife birthing center 45 miles away in St.
Petersbury.
   Urban said he couldn't stop on the three-mile Howard Frankland
Bridge because the tractor-trailer rig was bearing down on their
car.
   The baby's head appeared while they made their way across the
bridge in a driving rain from Tropical Storm Marco, which later was
downgraded.
   ``My husband just reached his arm down and held the baby's head
till we got across,'' Mrs. Urban said. Her husband had to unwrap
the cord from the baby's neck.
   Garrett Michael Urban, 6 pounds, 2 ounces, was in good health
and went home with his parents later Thursday, just about the time
the first rays of post-storm sunlight peeked through clouds.
   ``I kept saying, `I can't believe we had our baby in the car,''
Mrs. Urban said.

   Allegations that parents traded their
children's sexual favors for as a little as a pack of cigarettes
have shaken a town trying to live down three civil rights murders
26 years ago.
   At least four children, now ranging in age from 11 to 15, were
sexually abused as long ago as 1985 by some of their parents, other
relatives and family friends, authorities said.
   Twenty adults, including one or both parents of each child, are
suspected and the case will go to a grand jury for consideration of
rape charges, investigators said.
   Police are investigating whether more children were involved,
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The investigation
has spread from Neshoba County to two neighboring counties.
   The investigation is a difficult one in a town that was the site
of one of the civil rights movement's most tragic events - the
murders of activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael
Schwerner in 1964.
   The activists' bodies were found buried in an earthen dam near
this rural farm town of about 8,000 in east-central Mississippi.
Nine people, including a Neshoba County deputy sheriff, went to
prison for violating the workers' civil rights.
   ``We've come a long way since that happened,'' said a resident
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``All we want now is to get on
with our lives. We don't want other (people) to think we condone
what was done to these children but we don't want any more bad
news.''
   ``There is a fear that with Philadelphia's past history people
in other areas of the country will think that all the people down
here are doing this and that's definitely not the case,'' said
Stanley Dearman, editor of the weekly Neshoba Democrat.
   ``People here are disgusted and they hope that some kind of
justice is brought to bear on those responsible,'' he aid.
   The investigation began in July when a telephone caller told
police one of the victims, an 11-year-old girl, confided to a baby
sitter that her stepfather sexually abused her, Bobby Anderson, the
town's chief police investigator, said during preliminary court
hearings.
   The girl later told authorities the abuse also included her
mother and others. The girl's mother denied that she sexually
abused her daughter, but said others had sexual intercourse with
the child.
   ``Sometimes the parents would let them at the child for a few
dollars or pack of cigarettes or some liquor,'' Anderson said,
before a judge slapped a gag order on people involved in the case.
   The victims include two other girls, age 11 and 15, and an
11-year-old boy. ``Something like this turns your stomach,'' said
Sheriff Glenn Waddell. ``It's hard to describe the feelings you
have when you sit down with an 11-year-old girl in the physical
shape she was in and get her to tell me all the things that she
went through.''
   Anderson said the case would be presented to a Neshoba County
grand jury Nov. 5.

   A boy whose dying wish - to meet
President Bush - was initially turned down by the White House will
get his dream after all, his family said.
   Bush decided Friday to meet with 8-year-old Jimmy Kilanowski
after he personally learned of the boy's wish to shake his hand.
   The White House called the Kilanowski family at their Long
Island home in Lake Ronkonkoma to arrange the meeting, scheduled
for Oct. 23 in Stamford, Conn., where Bush will be campaigning.
   ``That's wow,'' Jimmy said when his mother, Laurie, gave him the
news.
   ``He is so happy,'' Mrs. Kilanowski said. ``We are all thrilled
that the president came through.''
   Jimmy, who was given 1{ years to live in April 1989 because of
five brain tumors, made his wish known through Wish Is Granted, an
organization that helps terminally ill children fulfill their
dreams.
   The request was turned down by White House staff members who
said the president was too busy.
   The boy has called Bush ``the most important man in the whole
wide world.'' New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato stepped in Thursday to
see if he could help, and successfully broke through the red tape
that apparently had kept Jimmy's wish from reaching Bush.
   Jimmy, his mother, father, Peter, and 5-year-old brother, Danny,
also will be treated to a White House visit during the Christmas
season.
   ``They said that way Jimmy can see the White House when it's
decorated like a fantasy land,'' Mrs. Kilanowski said.
   It is White House policy to grant wish requests only through
Make A Wish Foundation, a national organization not affiliated with
Wish Is Granted. That apparently was the main reason Jimmy
initially was turned down by the White House.
   ``When the president learned of this young boy's wish, he said
he would do everything he could to try to make it a reality,''
D'Amato said.
   ``I think Jimmy is an inspiration - the fact that when he was
initially turned down he said `well, I still love the president.'
Jimmy never lost his spirit,'' the senator said.

<TEXT>
   The government has suddenly switched
to painful and politically risky capitalist reform, raising fears
of winters as cold and dark as those imposed by executed Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   It cut energy subsidies and credits to the country's chronically
inefficient government-owned industries and said the same treatment
was in store for private consumers.
   On Friday it said the country's second-largest automaker will be
allowed to go bankrupt if it can't pay its debts.
   Officials also have put Romanians on notice that
state-controlled prices will go up, and that the country can afford
no more across-the-board wage increases. Economics Minister Eugen
Dijmarescu warned that could cause civil unrest.
   ``The country has lived for 40 years in an equal system of
wages,'' he told reporters. ``These are crazy people because they
don't know anything else. ... We have to teach them that wages,
like profits, are not assured, and they must strive to earn them.''
   The National Salvation Front, which dominated the interim
government after the December revolution that toppled and executed
Ceausescu, was at first mostly concerned with winning May
elections.
   It took the politically popular steps of shortening the workweek
and raising salaries, stopping food exports and lifting Ceausescu's
heat and energy rationing. It handily won the vote.
   The grim results of the government's largesse were presented to
Parliament Oct. 10 by Prime Minister Petre Roman and Anton
Vatasescu, the minister of commerce and industry.
   Productivity has fallen about 20 percent compared to last year.
The decline has been felt especially in energy production, which
has become even more crucial since the Persian Gulf crisis began in
August.
   Exports are down and imports are up. The trade imbalance has
grown to a projected annual $3.6 billion.
   Declining production and higher wages has led to a near-total
depletion of the meager stocks in Romanian stores.
   Maintenance of the centrally controlled, heavily subsidized
pricing system has bred massive corruption. Many stores sell off
most goods to speculators at prices above the official ones.
Speculators resell the goods for even more, often for hard currency
only.
   This has driven the black market rate of 100 leu to the dollar,
five times the official rate.
   The government's solution, Roman announced, was ``inevitably
liberalization of prices,'' which officials said was to be enacted
within one month.
   But the elimination of subsidies and price controls will have
the unpopular effect of shifting high black market prices into
state stores.
   Along with the devaluation of the leu, which officials say is
imminent, this is almost certain to generate more demands for
higher wages and possibly strikes, further damaging production.
   Roman warned Parliament that ``we cannot permit further pay
raises.''
   The government has attempted to head off public discontent by
assuring private consumers they will have enough heat and light
this winter. But many might not be able to meet the higher cost.
   To shift energy from industry, which consumes more than 80
percent of it, the government cut industrial energy subsidies and
imposed special taxes on energy use by industry. This more than
quadrupled the cost to industry of some forms of energy.
   The government said Friday that the huge automotive joint
venture Oltcit would be allowed to go bankrupt if it cannot make
good on debts of more than a billion dollars.
   Oltcit, a Romanian-French joint venture, would be the first
company to be allowed to bankrupt, signaling the government's tough
new stand as it makes initial steps toward a market economy.
   The manufacturer produced tens of thousands of cars that were
replicas of an early 1980s model Citroen. It is Romania's
second-largest car manufacturer after the Dacia company, which
produces replicas of a 1970s model Renalt.
   The government also is looking to foreign investment to rescue
Romanian industry by injecting know-how and money into its
antiquated infrastructure in exchange for what Dijmarescu called
``a capable and cheap work force.''
   Foreign investment has been stifled by Romania's poor
international image, the result of political and ethnic unrest
since the revolution.
   In March, six people were killed in rioting between ethnic
Romanians and Transylvanians. In June, another six were killed when
police suppressed a 53-day anti-government protest, and
pro-government miners terrorized the capital for several days.
   The government now hopes the negative effects on foreign
investment will be reversed by Romania's support for the West in
the gulf crisis and new laws encouraging privatization and foreign
ownership of local firms.
   Diplomatic and economic sources say there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of foreign companies sending delegations to
investigate business opportunities in Romania.

<HEAD>North, South Korea Agree to Unify Sports Team</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North and South Korea announced today
they have agreed to field a single team for the 1992 Olympic Games
and other sports events, possibly signaling a new era of
cooperation between the rival nations.
   North Korea, in a statement by its news agency, said the accord
had ``contributed to the cause of national unification.''
   Waving a bouquet of flowers triumphantly, South Korean Sports
Minister Chung Dong-sung announced the agreement in principle on
crossing the border at the truce village of Panmunjom.
   He had returned home with this country's men's and women's
soccer teams from the first scheduled inter-Korea sports exchange
since the division of the peninsula in 1945.
   The minister read a statement saying he had reached the
agreement with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun.
   He said they agreed to form a single Korean team for the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona; the 41st World Table Tennis Championships in
Nagoya, Japan, in 1991; the Winter Asian Games in Samjiyon; and
other major international sports events.
   The North Korean news agency, monitored in Tokyo, said the
agreement was made public before the South Korean soccer teams left
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
   Communist North and capitalist South Korea have been archenemies
since the division of the peninsula at the end of World War II. The
border between them is tightly sealed with more than 1.5 million
troops on either side.
   The agreement to form joint teams is viewed as a sign that a new
period of harmony between the two nations may be at hand. They have
also been holding talks in an effort to ease military and political
tension.
   The five-day trip to North Korea by 76-members of South Korea's
soccer teams was only the second inter-Korean civilian exchange
since partition. A small family exhange was held in 1985.
   The North Korean soccer teams are to visit South Korea Oct.
21-25 for a second exhibition soccer match. On Sunday, a 17-member
delegation of South Korean musicians will cross the border at
Panmunjom to spend 10 days in North Korea participating in a series
of joint concerts.
   Officials said the two Koreas will discuss the proposed
formation of a single inter-Korean team when they meet again in
Seoul in two weeks.
   The two Koreas, which both pride themselves on their sports
prowess, have initiated talks on forming a single sports team
several times in the past but failed to reach agreement over
procedural and other matters.
   North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul.

   A U.S. chartered jet carrying 257
refugees from Iraq and Kuwait was the first such exodus in nearly
three weeks.
   The Pan Am Boeing 747 touched down at Raleigh-Durham
International Airport on Friday, ending a long and tiring odyssey
for 123 American citizens, seven Canadians and 127 passengers of
unknown nationality.
   About 103 on board were children, many of them infants.
   ``When the plane touched down in North Carolina, I hollered so
loud `Thank God I'm in freedom city,'' said Mohammed Issa, a native
of Jordan and a U.S. citizen.
   The first group off the plane were women in Middle Eastern garb,
such as flowing robes and veils, carrying sleeping children and
some personal belongings as they came down the ramp. North Carolina
National Guardsmen escorted other children off the plane.
   Three people on board were in wheelchairs. One was diabetic, one
was suffering from a blood disease and one was heavily sedated,
said Joe Dean, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Crime
Control and Public Safety and a member of a welcoming party allowed
onto the plane.
   ``The moment I reached U.S.A., I started crying and I cried not
because of the crisis, because it is hard when you see a friend
treat you better than a brother,'' said a Palestinian mother of
four who did not want to give her name or have her photograph
taken.
   Issa returned to the United States with his wife and parents. He
said the trip from Kuwait to Baghdad was the ``most miserable trip
we've ever taken.''
   ``There was no food. A trip that was supposed to take 1{ hours,
maybe two, took 14 hours,'' said Issa, a former U.S. Marine who was
once stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   He said a caravan of buses stopped in the desert for five hours,
but there appeared to be no mechanical breakdowns or other reason
for the delay.
   ``They were trying to break us down mentally, to make us suffer
some,'' Issa said. ``They were trying to put some pressure on us to
see if maybe somebody wouldn't do something.''
   When the caravan finally got to Basra, the last stop before
Baghdad, Issa was charged the equivalent of $72 for eight candy
bars and four cartons of juice for his family.
   Issa said he would return to Bridgeport, Conn., where he taught
before going to Kuwait as a special education teacher.
   The flight arrived in London on Thursday night, where passengers
spent the night before completing the final leg of their journey
away from the crisis in the Middle East, begun when Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   The World Chess Championship will resume Monday
after challenger Anatoly Karpov used one of his three time-outs to
postpone the third game against Garry Kasparov.
   Karpov sent word of his decision Friday, seven minutes before
the deadline for a time-out.
   Karpov and Kasparov, the champion, battled to a draw in Monday
night's opening game. Kasparov drew first blood with a victory on
Wednesday. The third game of the best-of-24-game, $3 million match
had been set for Friday but was put off until Monday because of the
time-out.
   Each player has the right to take three time-outs during the
match. Generally, the time-outs are taken on a Monday or Friday to
give a player a long weekend. They can also be used for illness.

   Le's death was confirmed by telephone from Tokyo by a Foreign
Ministry official who asked not to be named.
   Le, one of the founders of the Indochina Communist Party in
1930, is best known for his part in the Vietnam War cease-fire of
1975. He served as special adviser to the North Vietnamese
delegation to the Paris Peace Conferences from 1968-73, and
eventually became North Vietnam's principal spokesman.
   In 1973, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for negotiating the
cease-fire. Le, however, refused the honor.
   After North Vietnam's victory over South Vietnam in 1975, Le
served as a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of
Vietnam.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   Kuwaiti exiles representing all walks of life gathered in
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, for a three-day Kuwaiti People's Conference
beginning today. The first session was expected to deal with ways
to intensify opposition to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
invasion on Aug. 2 and annexation of their country after a dispute
over oil, land and money.
   ---
   A U.S. Marine amphibious force is planning a practice assault on
the Arabian coast that could be a trial run for an invasion of
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, Pentagon sources said Friday. The French
magazine L'Express, meanwhile, reported that U.S. officials have
devised plans for a four-day war with Iraq next month to liberate
Kuwait and destroy Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's armed forces.
But the assault could cost as many as 20,000 American lives, the
magazine said. U.S. officials wouldn't comment.
   ---
   In what was widely interpreted as part of an effort to hold
together the Arab alliance opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the
United States joined the rest of the U.N. Security Council in
denouncing Israel for the killing of 19 Palestinians during rioting
in Jerusalem this week.
   ---
   Pentagon sources say the United States now has more than 200,000
troops in the Persian Gulf region. The administration has refused
to say exactly how many U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines
are in Saudi Arabia or afloat in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and
northern Arabian Sea. There are believed to be about 430,000 Iraqi
soldiers in Kuwait and southern Iraq.

<HEAD>Hanford Operator: Radioactive Waste, Water Added to Leaky Tank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAD, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Hanford nuclear
reservation says workers in the 1960s pumped almost 1 million
gallons of radioactive waste and water into a tank that had leaked
in the past.
   Westinghouse Hanford said Friday the tank leaked about 2,400
gallons of liquid in 1962. Despite that leak, about 780,000 gallons
of radioactive waste and 150,000 gallons of cooling water were
added to the tank between 1963 and 1967, said Richard Raymond, a
Westinghouse manager.
   ``The presumption is that some amount of cooling water leaked
out of the tank and took some waste material with it,'' he said.
``How much - we don't know.''
   Another damaged waste tank at Hanford may have leaked 800,000
gallons of radioactive cooling water into the soil, the Energy
Department said Thursday. The department reported a year ago that
tank had leaked 5,000 gallons of liquid since it ruptured in a 1965
explosion.
   The two underground, single-shell tanks are about five miles
apart on the 560-square-mile nuclear reservation in south-central
Washington.
   The 1965 explosion caused tank 105-A to leak and the radioactive
wastes inside to overheat. The new estimate shows 832,000 gallons
of cooling water were pumped into the tank between 1965 and 1978,
when the work stopped.
   The Energy Department estimates 40,000 to 200,000 gallons may
have evaporated through vents, leaving 632,000 to 792,000 gallons
still in the soil.
   Provost said the state needs precise leak data so it knows how
much work is required under a 30-year federal plan for cleaning up
the entire Hanford site, which Westinghouse Hanford began operating
for the Energy Department in 1987.
   Hanford waste engineer Johnnie Newsom said officials are still
combing old records to determine how much waste was leaked. The
Energy Department has agreed to turn over any additional records to
the state.
   The tank filled with nearly 1 million gallons of waste and water
was pumped dry in 1980 and is no longer in service. It cannot be
determined how much of its contents may have evaporated or leaked,
but a Westinghouse investigation continues, Raymond said.
   Recent monitoring of the soil beneath the tank indicates that no
radioactive cooling water reached ground water or traveled away
from the vicinity, Westinghouse Hanford said.
   Hanford has 177 underground waste storage tanks. They were used
to store radioactive waste generated in four decades of producing
plutonium for nuclear weapons.

   Hurricane Lili weakened off the Carolinas early today and was
downgraded to a tropical storm. It posed little threat to South
Atlantic states battered by a week of high wind and heavy rain from
two other tropical storms.
   At least 11 people in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina
have died in storms since Wednesday.
   Residents boarded up their windows along North Carolina's Outer
Banks, shelters were readied and some tourists fled, but the state
was likely to be spared Lili's full brunt, forecasters said.
   Lili, whose winds dropped nearly 10 mph below the hurricane
threshold of 74 mph, was expected to turn to the north and move
away from the Carolina coastline.
   ``This motion should keep the storm and its effect away from the
mid-Atlantic Coast,'' said forecaster Martin Nelson of the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gable, Fla.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Lili's winds were 65 mph, down from 75 mph
earlier in the morning. The storm was centered at latitude 34.0
north and longitude 73.0 west, about 175 miles southeast of Cape
Hatteras, N.C. It moved north-northwest at 12 mph.
   The hurricane was not expected to hit land today, Nelson said.
The storm was headed toward the Northeast, but odds of landfall
were lessening, he said.
   Georgia and the Carolinas kept an eye on floodwaters from heavy
rain from the remnants of tropical storms Marco and Klaus. In South
Carolina, thousands were told to evacuate their homes. High water
receded in some areas, but others remained threatened by flooding.
   South Carolina's climatologist, John Purvis, said some areas of
the state had the most rainfall in a century. Sumter County
received more than 15 inches of rain within 24 hours Thursday.
   A 2-year-old boy died Friday in South Carolina after he wandered
away from home. Two others drowned in the state and a fourth
remained missing.
   Rising waters in Georgia killed four people, incduding an
80-year-old man as he and his wife struggled to leave a flooded
railroad track.
   One person drowned and two died in storm-related traffic
accidents in North Carolina.
   Two emergency centers opened in Ashe County in northwestern
North Carolina as streams and rivers overflowed their banks, said
Renee Hoffman of the state Division of Emergency Management.
   More than 5,000 South Carolinians were told Friday night to
evacuate their homes as rivers and creeks swelled around the state
and threatened to flood low-lying areas.
   ``Even if it stops raining, the dams could develop problems two
or three days from now,'' said George Ballenger, South Carolina's
chief of dams and reservoir safety.
   At Cape Hatteras on North Carolina's Outer Banks, surfers and
wind surfers scurried for surging surf and swift winds Lili sent
their way.
   ``I would only leave if they told us to leave,'' said Gus
Linssen of Boston, one of many tourists at Canadian Hole, a favored
wind surfing spot near Buxton.

<HEAD>Washington Party, Ruled Off Ballot, Vows Retribution Against

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Illinois Supreme Court ruling knocked a third
party slate of candidates off the November ballot, and the party's
rejected candidates vowed retribution against the Democratic Party
on Election Day.
   ``The Democrats continue to dig a very deep hole for themselves
in the November election,'' David Reed, chairman of the Harold
Washington Party, said Friday. ``We know who the adversary is.''
   The state high court voted 4-3 along party lines Friday to
reject nominating petitions filed by the predominantly black party.
   The four Democratic members of the high court ruled that the
party had failed to collect enough signatures for its candidates
and had illegally used the Harold Washington Party label.
   The three Republican justices said the majority was needlessly
strict in interpreting the election code.
   The party, named after the city's first black mayor, had sought
to put 19 candidates on the Nov. 6 ballot for offices in Cook
County, which comprises Chicago.
   The Washington Party contended that the Democratic Party was
behind the ballot challenge.
   Democrats, who feared they might lose large numbers of straight
party voters to the party, contended that Republicans were behind
the third party effort. They tried to disassociate themselves from
the ballot challenge, fearing a backlash from black voters.
   The high court upheld a ruling Sept. 20 that removed all the
party's candidates from the ballot. Circuit Judge Eugene L.
Wachowski ruled that although the party had gathered sufficient
nominating petition signatures from Chicago, it fell short of the
legally required minimum for each of its suburban candidates.
   The party is appealing Wachowski's ruling in U.S. District
Court.

the Viet Minh, the Communist insurrection group. He also helped
shape a revived Communist party called the Vietnam Workers' Party,
which has since become the nation's ruling body.

<TEXT>
   Rain fell in the Northeast and Ohio Valley early today, and the
threat of hurricane winds lashing the South-Atlantic states
disminished as tropical storm Lili weakened off the Carolinas.
   Today's forecast called for much of the nation to have sunny
skies and warm temperatures.
   Rain was forecast for parts of New York, Connecticut, Virginia
and North Carolina. Clear skies were expected farther south along
the coast into Florida.
   Clear skies were likely in the Midwest, South and West, except
for scattered rain and snow in parts of Washington state, Oregon,
Idaho and Montana.
   Off the Outer Banks of North Carolina today, Hurricane Lili was
downgraded to tropical storm status as its winds dropped to 65 mph
winds.
   Forecasters said Lili was not expected to hit land today.
   Heavy rain Friday caused flooding across much of the region.
   Temperatures ranged from the 80s along the East Coast, Midwest
and West to the 90s in Florida and the Southwestern deserts and the
60s in the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes region.
   The nation's high on Friday was 101 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif.

<HEAD>Ex-Double Agent Says KGB Backed Gorbachev To Succeed Chernenko</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former double agent Oleg Gordievsky says the KGB
backed Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in the early 1980s,
believing he could save the Soviet economy, according to extracts
published today from the ex-spy's book.
   The book also tells of unsuccessful KGB efforts through
political contacts and the news media to hamper the reelection of
former President Ronald Reagan.
   Gordievsky, 52, who fled to Britain in 1985, makes the claim in
a book, ``KGB: The Inside Story of its Foreign Operations from
Lenin to Gorbachev.'' He wrote the work with Christopher Andrew, a
Cambridge University intelligence historian.
   Serialization of extracts from the book began today in The Times
of London and will continue next week. The book will be published
in Britain and the United States on Oct. 19.
   The book, as serialized, said that in the closing months of
1984, Gordievsky was the deputy KGB chief in London and the
agency's local head of political intelligence. He had been working
for Britain's MI6 espionage agency for more than 10 years.
   Gordievsky's book stated: ``It was clear to the London residency
(KGB branch) that the KGB was backing Gorbachev for the succession
to the increasingly moribund (Communist Party General Secretary)
Konstantin Chernenko. ...
   ``Without a change in the Soviet leadership, the KGB saw no end
to the problems of the Soviet economy and no end, either, to
Western attempts to exploit them.
   ``In the months before Chernenko's long-expected death in March
1985, the KGB put great care into briefing Gorbachev in a way that
would allow him to impress the rest of the Politburo with his grasp
of Soviet and world affairs.
   The former spy said, however, that KGB support was only one
reason that Gorbachev won election as Communist general secretary
in March 1985. He said the KGB ``saw the election, nonetheless, as
a major victory.''
   In describing the purported anti-Reagan effort, the book says
that the KGB told its agents in the United States ``to begin
planning to thwart Reagan's bid for re-election in November 1984.''
   ``Although arms control negotiations were still going on in
Geneva, KGB leaders felt there was no chance of agreement. Any
other American president, Democrat or Republican, would therefore
be preferable to Reagan.
   The former spy said KGB agents in the United States ``were
instructed to acquire contacts on the staff of all possible
candidates and inside both parties.''
   It did not explain how they planned to try to manipulate these
contacts but added: ``Simultaneously, residencies throughout NATO
were told to popularize the slogan `Reagan means war.'
   The book says the KGB branches around the world ``found it easy
to claim credit, frequently undeserved, for many of the anti-Reagan
articles which flooded the world's press.''
   On Friday, Gordievsky said in an interview that the KGB helped
ignite last year's East European revolutions to put pro-Gorbachev
reform Communists in power. But he said the KGB and its Soviet
Communist Party bosses never expected the outpouring of
anti-Communist fervor which they were later helpless to stop.
   He did not say where he learned about the alleged KGB
involvement in Eastern Europe. But he regularly goes to the United
States for meetings with U.S. officials and international analysts,
and he consults for the journal ``Intelligence and National
Security.''
   Gordievsky began working for the British while posted in
Copenhagen, Denmark, in the early 1970s. He has said the 1968
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia pushed him to act on his growing
disillusionment.
   The KGB sent him to London, but he was recalled to Moscow and
questioned about his activities. He eluded his KGB tail and escaped
to the West.
   His 1985 defection sparked a tit-for-tat expulsion of 31 Soviet
and 31 British diplomats, trade representatives and journalists.

   Federal regulators may give the Library of
Congress a collection of memorabilia from the world of magic that
was seized from the head of a failed thrift.
   Thousands of posters, handbills, 16th-century books and private
letters from Harry Houdini and other noted magicians were taken
from Carl M. Rheuban after the savings and loan he ran was closed
last month.
   Regulators say Rheuban, who ran First Network Savings in Century
City, allegedly spent at least $1.5 million of the thrift's money
on the magic collection, which was named after the late John
Mulholland, an early 20th century magician.
   Library of Congress officials say they don't have the money to
buy the collection, which was seized by the federal Resolution
Trust Corp., the bailout agency for ailing savings and loans.
   ``These aren't just card tricks we are talking about,'' Larry
Sullivan, chief of the rare books collections at the federal
library, said of the magic collection.
   Kevin Shields, spokesman for Resolution Trust, said his agency
usually sells all seized assets at auction, but the rarity of the
magic collection has him considering whether to hand it over to the
Library of Congress.
   ``It is an unusual asset, to say the least, for a savings and
loan to have. If this were an apartment building, it would be an
easy decision,'' said John F. Penrose, who is overseeing the
thrift's closing for Resolution Trust.

   Riot police fired tear gas today to
block a street march by thousands of angry protesters leaving an
anti-government rally attended by more than 100,000 dissidents and
opposition supporters.
   Meanwhile, the health of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung
deteriorated on the sixth day of his hunger strike against the
government.
   About 20,000 people protesting government surveillance waved
banners and shouted ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo.'' They
were blocked from marching toward downtown Seoul by riot police
about 2 miles from the park where the mass protest was held.
   Police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse radicals and
dissidents hurling firebombs and chunks of cement pavement torn
from the sidewalks.
   Injury figures were not immediately available.
   ``Disband Defense Security Command,'' protesters shouted as
thousands of other marchers clicked flashlights and cigarette
lighters on and off in the dark in a show of protest and unity.
   The protesters were demanding the dissolution of the Defense
Security Command military intelligence which has conducted illegal
and widespread spying on more than 1,300 civilians.
   Violence also erupted inside the park as the rally ended when
some protesters hurled rocks and bottles toward the podium. Another
group of protesters attacked a truck carrying about 20 members of
the splinter Democratic Party. One party member was seen bleeding
from his head.
   The reason for the violence was unclear, but it appeared to be
disagreement between two factions of opposition parties attending
the rally.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of leading opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, had been expected to speak at the rally, but doctors
said the 66-year-old leader's health had deteriorated after six
days of no food and he was not strong enough to appear.
   ``The barbarious surveillance of civilians by the security
command clearly shows the Roh regime as a disguised military
dictatorship,'' said National Assemblyman Choi Yong-keun, who said
he was speaking for Kim.
   Aides said Kim, a two-time presidential candidate, had lost
about 13 pounds since his fast began and he suffered stomach
cramps. Kim was undergoing routine tests for admittance to a
hospital, they said.
   Kim launched his hunger strike last Monday to demand reforms
from the government and call attention to a scandal involving the
military intelligence Defense Security Command, which allegedly
spied on more than 1,300 civilians.
   The turmoil comes in the second month of a boycott by the 78
opposition members of the 299-member National Assembly. The
opposition members resigned en masse in August, charging the
government with railroading bills and curtailing democratic
reforms.
   Roh fired the defense minister and head of military intelligence
earlier this week. The new minister said military reforms would be
made and an investigation was under way into the surveillance
scandal.
   Opposition leader Kim said he would continue his fast until the
government met four demands - disolution of military intelligence,
implementation of local self-rule, economic reform and the ruling
party's agreement to drop efforts to change from a presidential to
parliamentary-cabinet system of government.
   U.S. Rep. Edward F. Feighan of Ohio sent a news release to Kim
saying he supported him. ``But the recent exposure of the
government's extensive domestic spying network makes one wonder
whether it intends to shed completely its past of military rule,''
the congressman said in the release.

<TEXT>
   Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker
and four security men today with a state funeral led by a
grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak.
   The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem
fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its
second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub. He was the first
Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot
President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago.
   Four assassins riding two motorbikes killed el-Mahgoub in a car
driving by a luxury hotel by the Nile.
   The death toll from the attack rose to six today with the death
of the speaker's chauffeur. Doctors in a Cairo hospital said the
driver suffered bullet wounds in the stomach, back and arm.
   Hassan Abu-Basha, a former police minister, told the Cairo
newspaper Al-Ahram he believed el-Mahgoub's slaying was the work of
Iraqi agents. He said the perpetrators possibly belonged to the
Palestinian extremist faction led by Abu Nidal.
   The funeral was at Nasr City, the same suburban neighborhood
where Sadat's funeral took place.
   Hundreds of red-bereted military police and white-uniformed
policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the
religious service was held. They also lined the funeral procession
route, as did hundreds of plainclothes security men.
   Mubarak, wearing a black suit and sunglasses, and British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on a two-day official visit, were
in the front row of about 1,000 mourners. They included relatives
of the dead, government officials and foreign diplomats.
   Symbolic units from the military services spearheaded the
procession, followed by a military band and two dozen
wreath-bearers.
   Behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the
four security men, draped in the red, white and black Egyptian
flag.
   A caisson bearing el-Mahgoub's coffin followed, also wrapped in
the flag. It was drawn by three pairs of black horses. Military
officers rode the three horses on the right. Immediately behind
came two officers carrying el-Mahgoub's decorations laid on
black-velvet cushions.
   The procession began from the mosque and stopped about 1,500
feet away. Relatives of the dead then lined up to accept
condolences from Mubarak and other mourners.
   Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa had warned days earlier of
such an attack. He said authorities arrested alleged saboteurs who
were entering the country with orders from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to assassinate Egyptian officials.
   Saddam has called Egypt a traitor to the Arab cause for sending
its troops to back the U.S. military buildup in the gulf in
response to the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, quoting police sources,
reported Monday that local Moslem extremists were collaborating
with Palestinian terrorists sent to the country by Iraq on sabotage
missions.
   It said the extremists had provided weapons and explosives to
five Palestinians from Abu Nidal's faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Recent reports said Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council recently moved its headquarters from
Libya to Iraq.
   Police ordered a state of alert at airports to keep the
assailants from fleeing and set up security checkpoints along Cairo
bridges.
   El-Mahgoub's authority extended solely over the 458-seat
Parliament, which he had headed since 1984. He was not active in
the gulf crisis, Al-Ahram noted in a front-page editorial today.
   ``In fact he was assassinated because he was a prominent
Egyptian politician. The assasins wanted to tell their terrorist
bosses that they pierced the stability of Egypt,'' the newspaper
said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We
are shocked by the assassination of the Egyptian speaker.
   ``We certainly deplore these kinds of terrorist activities and
assassination is the most vile kind of terrorism. We don't have any
indication at this time who was responsible or what their purposes
were,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Making common cause with its new Arab
allies, the United States has joined the rest of the Security
Council in denouncing Israeli authorities for killing 19
Palestinians during rioting in Jerusalem.
   In its unanimous vote late Friday, the council asked for a U.N.
investigation of the deaths. But Israel said today it must consider
whether it would allow such a mission on its territory.
   The U.S. vote for the resolution represented a rare departure
from the usual American practice of defending Israel, its longtime
ally, from censure in the council.
   The last U.S. vote against Israel in the United Nations was in
1988 over the Israeli practice of expelling suspected leaders of
the Arab uprising, known as the intefadeh.
   Diplomats said the United States wanted to avoid a veto on the
issue because it feared alienating its Arab allies in the
international effort against Iraq.
   ``Beginning from now, Israel's protective umbrella will begin to
be steadily removed,'' Malaysia's ambassador, Rasali Ismail,
predicted early today.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization today accused the United
States of preventing the Security Council from developing a
stronger response.
   Yasser Abd Rabou, a member of the PLO's executive committee,
said in Tunisia today that the resolution was ``insufficient'' even
though it condemned the actions of Israeli police.
   The PLO initially sought a three-member Security Council mission
that would have made recommendations on how to protect Palestinians
in the occupied territories. That was seen as part of a PLO tactic
of trying to get the council directly involved in supervising the
territories.
   The resolution instead envisages an inquiry organized by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
said the killings ``never should have happened.''
   ``The Security Council tonight grieves for those lost and
injured (and) condemns the acts of violence - both provocative and
reactive,'' he said.
   Monday's rioting in Jerusalem broke out after Arabs threw rocks
at praying Jews. The Arabs were killed when police moved in, first
with tear gas and rubber bullets, but later with live ammunition.
   In addition to the 19 dead, about 140 Arabs were wounded. About
30 Jews were injured.
   The U.N. resolution ``condemns especially the acts of violence
committed by the Israeli security forces resulting in injuries and
loss of human life.''
   It also refers to the injury of ``innocent worshipers'' in an
implied criticism of the Palestinian rock-throwers. The PLO had
fought to have that phrase removed.
   The resolution was sponsored by Britain, Canada, the Soviet
Union, Zaire, Finland, Ivory Coast, and France.
   Israel expressed regret over the resolution this morning.
However, Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein, in a statement from his
Foreign Ministry, complained that the resolution ``fails to condemn
the cause of the tragic events in Jerusalem, an unprovoked Arab
attack on Jewish worshipers. ...
   ``It is also regrettable that the Security Council fell into the
trap laid by (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein and his PLO
supporters, who inspired the riots in order to divert attention
from Iraq's aggression in the gulf.''
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel today
said the Cabinet would have to decide whether it would accept a
U.N. investigating team.
   The statement by spokesman Avi Pazner said the U.N. action was
``without any reason or justification'' since the police opened
fire after a stoning attack by Palestinians that injured more than
30 Jewish worshipers and police.
   One Western ambassador said the United Nations would send an
American of such stature that the Israeli government would find it
impossible to refuse the visit. The ambassador spoke on condition
of anonymity and did not elaborate.
   The investigating team would be charged not only with looking
into how Monday's riots were handled but at ``other similar
developments in the occupied territories.'' It would recommend ways
of ensuring the safety of Palestinians.
   Israel captured the Arab sector of Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war and later annexed it.
   The U.N. resolution followed five days of arduous bargaining
among the United States and non-aligned nations on the 15-member
council.
   The only Arab on the Security Council, Ambassador Abdalla Saleh
al-Ashtal of Yemen, said the non-aligned countries supported the
compromise because it is ``a clear condemnation of Israeli actions,
something the council didn't do for a very long time.''
   He said the investigating mission will report back to the
Security Council by Oct. 24.
   The last U.S. condemnation of Israel was in 1988, when American
officials objected to its expulsions of suspected ringleaders of
the Palestinian uprising from the occupied lands.
   The United States cast a dramatic U.N. vote denouncing Israel in
1982, when Israeli forces invaded Lebanon to oust the PLO. It did
so again in 1981, when the Israelis bombed a nuclear power plant in
Iraq.

   Le Duc Tho, a hard-line Communist
revolutionary named as a winner of the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for
negotiating a settlement in the Vietnam War, died today in Hanoi.
Official accounts say he was 79.
   The Foreign Ministry in the Vietnamese capital said by telephone
that Tho died early in the day but gave no details.
   Japan's Kyodo's news agency, reporting from Hanoi, said he died
of throat cancer. He had been hospitalized at an army hospital
since returning in April from treatment in Paris, the report said.
   Tho shared the Nobel prize with then-Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger. Together, they negotiated the Paris Peace Accords of
1973. But Tho turned down the prize, saying Vietnam remained at
war.
   The guns fell silent two years later, when Communist forces
defeated the U.S.-backed Saigon government and unified the country.
   Tho, one of the organizers and theoreticians of Communist
revolution in Vietnam, remained in the ruling Politburo after 1975.
He was believed to have played a key role in Vietnam's invasion of
Cambodia in late 1978.
   But in 1986, he was removed from the Politburo as aging veterans
gave way to more liberal leaders seeking economic reform.
   Western diplomats have speculated that in recent years, Tho's
power had ebbed but that he remained an important figure in the
party's conservative ranks. His official position was adviser to
the party's Central Committee.
   Until the end, Tho kept parts of his life from the public domain
as did many revolutionary leaders of his generation. There are
several different versions of his birthdate and accounts of his
early life.
   By some accounts, he was born of poor parents in a village about
60 miles south of Hanoi. But some Western biographical sources say
his father was a civil service official of middle rank in the
French colonial administration.
   Still in his teens, Tho became involved in left-wing labor and
political movements and helped organize several protests in the
Hanoi area.
   He was among the founding members of the Indochinese Communist
Party in 1930 and was later imprisoned by the French. In jail, he
reportedly organized some fellow inmates, who nicknamed him ``Tho
the Phonograph'' for his ceaseless recitations of Marxist
literature, which he had learned by heart.
   His activities during World War II are still a matter of
speculation among Western historians. Some sources say Tho escaped
to China and helped Vietnam's founding father, Ho Chi Minh, form
the Viet Minh guerrillas and lead them against the Japanese. Others
say Tho spent some of the war years in a French prison in Vietnam.
   After the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and
during the war against the French colonialists, Tho became a key
Communist Party organizer in South Vietnam and a prime purger of
the middle and upper classes in North Vietnam.
   He became a member of the party's Politburo in the 1950s and an
expert on party organization and ideology. Periodically, he
criticized ``revisionists, defeatists, traitors, pessimists and
individualists'' within party ranks.
   Although a party watchdog through much of his career, he often
called for patience and moderation in healing internal rifts.
Unlike parties in China and the Soviet Union, Communists in Vietnam
carried out no bloody purges.
   During the Vietnamese war in 1960s and 1970s, Tho apparently did
not have a direct say in military matters.
   Until 1968, his diplomatic experience had been limited to trips
to various Communist nations, usually as head of Hanoi's delegation
to party gatherings.
   In 1968, with the Vietnam War stalemated, the United States and
North Vietnam opened talks on a cease-fire. Tho was officially
described as special adviser to his delegation, but it became
apparent that the real powers to negotiate lay with him.
   In Kissinger, Tho faced an adversary acknowledged as one of the
most skilled and stubborn negotiators of recent times. The
silver-haired Tho also proved a man of considerable social polish
and personal charm, although he rarely sought the limelight during
his years in Paris.
   The negotiations dragged on year after year, the two sides
trying to overcome what Kissinger called ``mountains and ravines''
of complexities. The accord was finally signed Jan. 27, 1973.
   It resulted in the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, the
exchange of prisoners and the splintering of South Vietnam into
Communist- and Saigon- controlled zones. But true peace failed to
materialize, each side accusing the other of sabotaging the
agreements.
   The Nobel Peace Prize Award of 1973 was perhaps the most
controversial ever. Leftists protested the selection of Kissinger,
and other critics bristled at the naming of a Communist
revolutionary.

   Syrian forces using land and air power
today blasted the stronghold of Gen. Michel Aoun, who ended his
11-month mutiny by fleeing to the French Embassy and ordering his
forces to surrender.
   Aoun told his troops to pledge allegiance to the government of
President Elias Hrawi, trying to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil
war among Christian and Moslem factions.
   Hrawi's army entered Aoun's presidential palace headquarters in
suburban Baabda at 12:45 p.m. (5:45 a.m. EDT), Beirut radio
stations reported.
   The official Syrian news agency SANA said that almost two hours
earlier, Syrian troops had taken control of the palace headquarters
and the Defense Ministry complex in the suburb of Yarze, which had
also been under Aoun's control.
   Aoun had opposed the government's peace plan, which gives the
Moslem majority an equal share of power, but has no timetable for
withdrawing the 40,000 Syrian troops, in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   The developments contributed to the growing instability in the
Middle East, where the United States is struggling to hold together
its alliance of Arab states opposed to the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon and Iraq's
arch-rival, is an important part of that effort.
   Several of Aoun's battalions surrendered after Aoun's order and
fighting was tapering off at the major entry points to the
Christian enclave, witnesses and police said. Civil aviation
authorities ordered Beirut airport closed.
   In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said France had granted Aoun
political asylum and was prepared to help him leave Beirut. Beirut
radio stations said Hrawi asked for a pledge from France to ban
Aoun from political activity.
   Aoun's departure removes a major obstacle toward implementing
the Arab League-brokered peace plan. But many enmnities still exist
not only between Christians and Moslems, but among the various
sects on both sides.
   ``This is a historical moment, heralding the reunification of
the Lebanese army and the return of peace to Lebanon,'' said
Hrawi's prime minister, Salim Hoss. He called for the Lebanese to
close ranks behind his government.
   At least 15 civilians were killed and 110 wounded in fighting
early today along Beirut's Moselm-Christian dividing line and
Lebanon's central mountains, police and hosptials said. Military
casualties were not immediately available.
   Aoun, 55, escaped assassination Friday by a Moslem Shiite gunman
who aimed a pistol at him as he addressed cheering supporters. The
crowd roughed up the gunman, and bullets went astray, wounding an
Aoun aide.
   ``I ask my chiefs of staff to take their orders henceforth from
Gen. Emile Lahoud,'' Aoun said in a brief address to his 15,000
mainly Christian troops broadcast by his Lebanese Radio station.
   Aoun, who had served as caretaker prime minister, had refused to
step down in November, when Hrawi was elected president.
   Hrawi's 20,000 mainly Moslem army, commanded by Lahoud, today
joined thousands of Syrians troops and hundreds of tanks in a
three-pronged ground assault on Aoun's enclave in Lebanon's
Christian zone.
   The attack began with two hours of Syrian air and artillery
bombardment of Aoun's palace headquarters east of Beirut.
   Lahoud's bulldozers knocked down mounds of earth and removed
wire barricades leading to the Aoun-held district of Ein Rummaneh
in east Beirut. Thousands of Aoun's supporters had formed a human
shield around the palace to help the general deter a Syrian
assault. Aoun's radio station said they left after the general told
them to go home at midnight Friday.
   ``Let us all rise above our hatreds and band together in a
national unity that will definitely lead Lebanon to peace, security
and stability,'' Hrawi said in a radio address to the nation after
Aoun's surrender.
   Moslem west Beirut, where Hrawi's government is based, erupted
in jubilant gunfire over Aoun's defeat. Lebanese and Syrian
soldiers in the Moslem sector shot sustained volleys of machine-gun
fire into the air.
   Defense Minister Albert Mansour ordered crossings between
Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors reopened ``to reunify the
capital.''
   Hrawi, Aoun, and Lahoud are all Maronite Catholics, the largest
Christian sect and the dominant power in Lebanon since it gained
independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun has tried to establish himself as the legitimate authority
in Lebanon since September 1988, when he was appointed caretaker
prime minister by outgoing President Amin Gemayel.
   Hrawi was elected president Nov. 24, 1989, with a mandate to
enforce the peace plan brokered by the Arab League. The agreement
stipulated an equal distribution of power between Moslems and
Christians.
   After his election, Hrawi promptly dismissed Aoun as army
commander and interim prime minister, but the general denounced
Hrawi as a ``Syrian puppet'' and refused to leave the presidential
palace.
   In an effort to bolster his own administration, Aoun waged an
unsuccessful war to oust Syrian troops from Lebanon. He also
battled forces of rival Christian militia leader Samir Geagea, a
supporter of the new government.
   Aoun's battles with the Syrian army from March to September 1989
claimed 929 lives and wounded 2,744 people. His fight with Geagea
this year from January until Sept. 26 killed 1,046 people and
wounded 3,222.

<HEAD>Report Warns of Gridlock in the Skies in Next Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic likely will double early in the
next century and billions of dollars in airport expansion and
thousand-seat planes may be needed to prevent gridlock in the
skies, said a report released Saturday.
   ``Delays in air travel have been mounting and could reach
staggering proportions in the coming years,'' the National Research
Council conclude in its report on a one-year study conducted for
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   In 1987, each of 21 major airports experienced more than 20,000
hours of flight delays. But by 1997, the report said, 39 airports
could reach that level. Delays could reach 100,000 hours a year at
such major hubs as Chicago, Atlanta and Denver.
   The nation's air transport system is expected to carry about 1.3
million domestic and international passengers a day in 1990.
   But shortly after the year 2000, the number is expected to reach
2.5 million a day or nearly 1 billion passengers a year, the report
said.
   ``If this growth continues, the system could be carrying 4
million to 5 million passengers daily by 2040, more than triple the
present volume of traffic,'' the report said.
   If plans are not made now to handle such vastly increased levels
of air travel, ``congestion and delay ... will be a constraint on
growth that will profoundly affect the society in the 21st
century.''
   The study calls for a blend of new construction, changes in
approach and greatly expanded research and development.
   Specific recommendations include:
   -The FAA should establish a strategic planning process through
the year 2040 with shorter-range goals in each 10-year period.
   -Increase capacity at up to 50 existing airports at a cost of
$40 million to $65 million each, with runway changes and
improvements in air-traffic control.
   -Develop new secondary hubs for connecting flights at some or
all of 28 under-used airports at a cost of $250 million to $500
million each.
   -Study ways to improve airport design, manage resources, reduce
airport noise, and integrate air and land transportation.
   -Create an expanded, centrally organized airport system by
giving the federal government authority to oversee improvements in
airport capacity, possibly including construction of 10 new major
airports. This could involve federal costs of $50 billion to $90
billion over the next 40 years.
   -Seek market-based solutions to capacity problems. This strategy
also involves the construction of 10 new airports but would give
state and local authorities responsibility for increasing airport
capacity. Estimated federal financing: $38 billion to $75 billion.
   -Develop larger subsonic jets of up to 1,000 seats for heavily
traveled routes, supersonic commercial transports for international
routes, and short-haul aircraft and miniports at suburban locations
for transfer purposes. Develop new surface transport systems to
absorb some of the 200-to-500 mile intercity traffic now handled by
aircraft. The estimated price tag in federal, local and private
funding: between $50 billion and $100 billion by 2020 and perhaps
$125 billion to $165 billion more by 2040.
   The report stressed that no matter what is done, congestion and
delay cannot be eliminated simply or permanently, especially when
weather and airspace congestion are taken into account.
   ``The best that can be achieved is a higher degree of efficiency
that reduces (congestion and delay) to an acceptable level at an
affordable cost,'' it said.

   A moderately strong earthquake shook
the central Philippines Saturday, officials said. There were no
reports of casualties or major damage.
   Seismologists said the earthquake, which measured 5.7 on the
Richter scale, was centered below the Sulu Sea, about 78 miles
southwest of Dumaguete City on Negros island.
   The earthquake's epicenter was about 410 miles south of Manila.
   Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippines Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology, said the earthquake lasted only a few
seconds and was hardly felt in nearby islands.
   In July, an earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale hit
the northern Philippines, leaving more than 1,600 people dead and
wide areas devastated.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures energy released by an
earthquake as measured on a seismograph.
   A quake measuring 5.7 can cause severe damage if it occurs in or
near a town center.

   Hundreds of Kuwaitis gathered in Saudi Arabia today to discuss
the future of their occupied homeland. In Washington, officials
said the U.S. buildup facing Iraqi invading forces had surpassed
200,000 troops.
   At the United Nations, U.S. officials joined the rest of the
Security Council in condemning Israel's security forces for killing
19 Palestinians in rioting in Jerusalem earlier this week.
   Diplomats said the United States had not exercised its veto
power over the resolution for fear of alienating Arab nations whose
support it needs against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   There were new indications that the United States might launch
an attack on Iraqi forces. Pentagon sources in Washington said
Friday a Marine amphibious force was planning a practice assault on
the Arabian coast as a trial run for a possible U.S. invasion of
Kuwait.
   And a French magazine said U.S. military officials have drawn up
an offensive plan against Iraq.
   More than 1,000 Kuwaiti exiles from all walks of life gathered
in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia for the three-day Kuwaiti People's
Conference, which began today.
   Hundreds of young men and women demonstrated outside Jiddah's
Conference Palace, raising banners of support for the emir and
shouting slogans calling for the liberation of Kuwait, which Iraq
invaded Aug 2.
   ``This conference is the most eloquent response to your enemy
who usurped your homeland,'' said the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, in his opening speech.
   The crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, also addressed the opening session and promised democracy
would increase in Kuwait after liberation from occupation by troops
loyal to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   More than 200,000 U.S. troops have been deployed against Iraq,
the Pentagon said. It has refused to say, however, exactly how many
U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are in Saudi Arabia or
on warships in the region.
   There are an estimated 430,000 Iraqi troops in Kuwait and
southern Iraq.
   The U.N. resolution approved in New York ``condemns ... the acts
of violence committed by the Israeli security forces resulting in
injuries and loss of human life.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization had supported a harsher
version of the resolution. The U.S. vote in favor of the resolution
was a rare departure from its usual practice of defending Israel,
from censure in the Council.
   The United States, however, did not want to allienate its Arab
allies, including Egypt and Syria, joining the multinational effort
against iraq.
   There were indications the United States might be growing
impatient with the U.N.-ordered economic embargo on Iraq. Pentagon
sources announced a practice assault on the Arabian coast.
   And the French news magazine, L'Express, reported that U.S.
military officials have drawn up plans to free Kuwait and defeat
Iraq in a four-day attack in November that would destroy Saddam's
armed forces.
   L'Express said U.S. planners estimated the offensive might cost
20,000 American lives, but gave no estimate for dead of other
nations.
   The magazine said it obtained an outline of the plan from an
unidentified aide to U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney. U.S.
officials refused comment on the reports.
   James R. Schlesinger, a former defense secretary and one-time
CIA director, and Joseph J. Sisco, former undersecretary of state,
both said Friday they consider the likelihood of Middle East
military action to be ``50-50.''
   They spoke at a news conference in Hot Springs, Va., after a
discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis with members of the Business
Council, a group of top American corporate leaders.
   In Jordan, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said today the
crisis had entered a new phase of ``reconsideration'' of stands in
another indication of a shift in Baghdad's hard-line attitude
toward Kuwait.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said it might stop Soviet detainees from
returning home if they have knowledge of Iraqi weapons systems. The
evacuation began a week ago and Iraq had promised to let at least
2,000 Soviets leave.
   Defense sources said Cheney planned to ask Soviet officials next
week for intelligence on the Iraqi military, armed largely by the
Soviet Union and France. The Soviets have condemned their former
ally over the invasion.
   A Pan Am jetliner with 257 evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait - the
first U.S.-chartered flight in nearly three weeks - landed Friday
at Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina. The passengers -
mostly women and children - included 123 Americans, six Canadians
and others of unknown nationality.

   Five villagers were killed in a
gunbattle between government troops and a band of guerrillas trying
to free their arrested comrades, military officials said Saturday.
   Five Tamil rebel captives also were killed escaping from the
patrol, which was ambushed at Attapallam village in the eastern
Ampara district on Friday, the officials said.
   The patrol was taking the seven captives to locate a rebel
hideout, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Two rebels fled during the shootout. Troops combing the village
afterward discovered the dead civilians.
   In a separate incident, a soldier was shot dead in an ambush by
rebels in the eastern Batticaloa district, the officials added.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since rebels from the
minority Tamil community started a separatist campaign in 1983,
claiming they were victims of discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese.

   President Gnassingbe Eyadema has pardoned two
men whose jail sentences for distributing anti-government tracts
triggered rioting in which four people were killed, state radio
said Saturday.
   Doglo Agbelenko and Logo Dossouvi were sentenced Oct. 5 to five
years' jail after a court found them guilty of distributing ``false
and defamatory tracts aimed at inciting the army to revolt.''
   Hundreds of their supporters went on a rampage, attacking police
stations in the capital and setting government vehicles on fire.
   Security forces opened fire. A government statement said three
people were killed by bullets and a fourth was beaten to death.
   Protesters had demanded a multiparty democracy, following a
pattern that has swept much of Africa this year.
   Eyadema decided Friday to free the jailed men, national radio
said. It gave no reason for the decision by the president, who
seized power in a 1967 coup and instituted a one-party state.

<HEAD>Prowling the Hallways With Lobbyists: Must Be Budget Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's party time, sort of, in the dimly lighted
marble hallway outside the House Ways and Means Committee hearing
room. But nobody's having much fun.
   They're clutching notebooks and documents, not drinks and
munchies. And most of their causes are lost ones, whether they're
trying to prevent luxury tax increases, protect Medicare or cut the
tax rate on capital gains.
   ``I don't think anybody in this hallway is doing very well. With
a $500 billion deficit-reduction package, everybody is going to get
hit,'' said a young man with glasses.
   Ah, if that were the only problem facing the lobbyists who have
been camping outside committee rooms for hours on end, monitoring
each incremental step of this year's tumultuous budget process;
hoping against hope for one last moment with some key lawmaker or
aide.
   They're bored. They're lonely. They're stretched thin. They've
got image trouble.
   ``We're sick of each other,'' said a hospital lobbyist
gesturing to two colleagues.
   ``I haven't seen my fiance in days,'' another woman said.
   ``Midterms start Monday,'' adds a young man studying for his
master's degree in international management.
   ``We've been tarred as fat cats,'' laments Ed Hatcher, senior
manager of tax policy for the American Electronics Association.
   His group wants - guess what - a capital gains tax cut. But only
a teeny one that wouldn't hurt the deficit much and would help
strung-out entrepreneurs trying to create ``the Apple computers of
tomorrow.''
   ``I personally think they should go easy on Medicare
beneficiaries,'' Hatcher said.
   Gucci Gulch, named for the soft designer leather worn by the tax
lobbyists who often congregate there, is a wide swath of hallway
across the front of the Longworth House Office Building.
   Committee Democrats were talking about capital gains taxes and
Medicare on Friday, and dozens of lobbyists had decided they had to
be on hand.
   They leaned against the marble walls, sat in stairwells, even
perched in wall niches just big enough for two. They filled the air
with esoteric references to asset reversions, corporate interest
disallowances, ESOPs and R&amp;D extenders.
   ``It really is sort of a social event,'' said Hatcher. ``The
trouble is, it's not terribly productive. I come up when they're
very close to reaching a decision. Otherwise, you're better off in
your office.''
   Many of the old hands at Gucci Gulch agree.
   ``I promise you a lot of the people are sitting out here in the
hall billing hours,'' said bank and real estate lobbyist Jim
Skinner, a 14-year veteran of the process.
   He added hastily: ``I'm waiting for a phone.''
   At this late stage, particularly with the political stakes so
high for Democrats, Republicans and the White House, most of those
haunting the hallways admit that it's too late to work their will
on anyone.
   Now they'll settle for information - even rumors and hearsay in
a pinch.
   ``Staying ahead of the information curve is basically my job,''
said Dan Harrington, an assistant at a law firm. ``It gets
exciting. You get caught up in the paper chase, the fun of getting
something before it's released.''
   Budget-watching is just about the only thing the hall-dwellers
have done for the past two weeks.
   ``It's seasonal work, like farmworkers,'' said Tom Nickels,
director of the Washington office of the American College of
Emergency Physicians. The group helped win a 3.5 percent Medicare
fee increase and he's trying to make sure it survives each
transmutation of each budget bill.
   Venture capitalists and homebuilders and Hatcher, meanwhile,
watch the capital gains tax cut fall in and out of favor on a daily
and sometimes hourly basis.
   ``There just comes a point where you have to look at the process
with a sense of humor,'' said Hatcher. ``If you don't, you really
will drive yourself crazy.''

   The interrogation of a former top East
German agent has led to the arrest of two more people suspected of
spying for the former Communist secret service, authorities said
Saturday.
   Two high-ranking officials in the counterespionage agency
working in the Lower Saxony state were arrested late Friday, state
authorities said.
   The latest arrests brought to 14 the number of suspected former
East German spies apprehended in one week.
   The series of arrests began after Klaus Kuron, a top official in
the former West German counterespionage service, turned himself in
over the weekend and began cooperation with investigators.
   Kuron has admitted that he ha also worked as an agent for the
now defunct East German intelligence for eight years.
   The latest two officials to be arrested knew the names of all
double agents and could have caused serious damage by their
revelations to the East German secret service, according to a
statement by the Lower Saxony state Interior Ministry.
   East Germany had a broad spy network in West Germany, but the
agents were left without a country when the two states merged on
Oct. 3.
   The Bonn government has appealed to former East German spies to
turn themselves in. Officials say up to 8,000 former spies may be
on the loose.

   A lone assailant has shot and seriously wounded
Germany's top law enforcement official, but officials say the
attacker had a history of mental problems and that terrorists were
not involved.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, considered a possible
future candidate for chancellor, was in stable condition today
after doctors removed a bullet from his spine, officials said.
   He was shot late Friday at a campaign meeting at a restaurant in
Oppenau, about 120 miles south of Frankfurt.
   Television repors said a security guard was also seriously
wounded when he threw himself in front of Schaeuble.
   After Friday's attack, Schaeuble was hospitalized in Freiburg
and underwent five hours of surgery.
   A medical bulletin described Schaeuble's condition today as
``satisfactory and stable.'' Interior Ministry spokesman Roland
Bachmeier said earlier that Schaeuble was ``seriously wounded'' but
that his life was not in danger.
   A ministry statement said Schaeuble was hit by two bullets.
Witnesses reported that three shots were fired.
   There were widely varying accounts of where Schaeuble had been
struck, but most reports said it was in the area of the head and
neck. A doctor who helped treat Schaeuble told ARD television that
he had been hit in the jaw and chest.
   ARD quoted a Munich-based journalist at the scene as saying
Schaeuble had bled heavily but could speak before he was rushed to
the hospital. The journalist said the suspect had seemed
``disturbed.''
   Prosecutor Werner Botz identified the gunman as Dieter Kaufmann.
Botz said the 37-year-old gunman is mentally disturbed. The man
told investigators he had felt threatened by the ``terror of the
state'' and had decided six months ago to take revenge by shooting
Schaeuble, according to Botz.
   In Bonn, Interior Ministry spokeman Willi Hausmann said there
was no evidence of terrorist background.
   Direct violent attacks aimed at top politicians were rare in
postwar German history, though top businessmen were prime terrorist
targets. Friday's attack was the second time in six months a top
German leader has been wounded during a public appearance.
   In April, a disturbed woman drove a knife into the neck of Oskar
Lafontaine, the Social Democratic candidate for chancellor, at an
April campaign rally.
   The West German candidate was badly hurt but soon resumed his
campaign for Dec. 2 national elections.
   Schaeuble, 48, was named interior minister in April 1989.
Overseeing police and security nationwide, he is said to be one of
Germany's most heavily protected politicians.
   In recent months, he guided the difficult, whirlwind talks that
led to the historic German unification on Oct. 3.
   The interior minister has been mentioned recently as a possible
successor to Kohl when the Christian Democratic leader decides to
retire.
   Many Germans recall Schaeuble's emotional announcement to
Parliament on Nov. 30 that Alfred Herrhausen, the nation's top
banker as chief of the powerful Deutsche Bank, had been killed in a
terrorist bomb blast.

   Faced with the inevitable decline in military
spending, defense contractors are adapting to a sharp drop in
business by using existing programs to help laid-off workers, a
study released Saturday said.
   The report by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency found that
the impact of a scaled-back defense budget will affect individual
companies and some communities, but nationwide the impact will be
minimal.
   ``We estimate that even if defense spending were reduced at an
annual rate of 2 percent for as long as five years, job loss would
be roughly 68,000 defense-related workers per year,'' according to
the study by the government agency.
   The agency found that programs in place through the Job Training
Partnership Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act, as well as assistance provided by the Defense Department's
Office of Economic Adjustment, are enough to help defense workers
who lose their jobs.
   Some members of Congress have pushed for additional programs to
assist employees and communities affected by lower defense
spending. The House-passed defense bills include $200 million for
existing programs and provides funds to affected communities.
   ``The economic effects of future reductions are unlikely to
require legislation to convert the defense industry to non-defense
activities, and that conversion directed by government mandate
would not be helpful,'' the study said.
   It did recommend, however, that Congress ease the pain for
workers by reducing the budget deficit, which would lead to lower
interest rates; improve conditions for investment by adjustments in
the tax system and encourage the use of commercial products in
defense buying.
   The report found that states heavily dependent on defense
contracts - California, Texas, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts
and Virginia - will feel the brunt of significant cuts in defense
spending.
   However, some states will be able to use the adjustment
assistance ``while others with large, varied and vibrant economies
such as California and New York would probably not require it,''
the report said.
   The purpose of the report, which was provided to Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., was to determine the effect of U.S.-Soviet arms
control agreements and the resulting cutbacks in defense spending.
   The study found that savings resulting from such agreements will
probably be limited during the years immediately after the signing
of arms control treaties.

<HEAD>Conservative Towns Skirt Repeal of Apartheid Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SASOLBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 37 years, blacks have been
legally banned from the sparkling blue waters of South Africa's
public swimming pools.
   That's supposed to change Monday with the end of the Separate
Amenities Act, a major apartheid law that segregated bathrooms,
swimming pools, libraries and other public facilities.
   But if Sasolburg officials have their way, few if any blacks
will join white residents in the town's municipal pools.
   A new local law takes effect Monday that allows only town
residents, most of them white, to use the public pools. The tens of
thousands of blacks forced by apartheid laws to live in townships
outside the city will still be barred.
   Similar measures aimed at restricting use of facilities to
whites have been reported in other towns controlled by the
pro-apartheid Conservative Party.
   The legal maneuvering by right-wing whites illustrates the depth
of South Africa's internal divisions. President F.W. de Klerk has
pledged to end apartheid, but many whites are unprepared to share
their daily life with blacks.
   ``Scrapping apartheid laws is one thing; ending race prejudice
and eradicating apartheid's deep roots will take a little longer,''
said The Star, an anti-apartheid newspaper in Johannesburg.
   Little will actually change with Monday's formal repeal of the
Separate Amenities Act. All major cities have wiped out the
so-called petty apartheid. Last Christmas, de Klerk opened the few
remaining segregated beaches to all races.
   Symbolically, though, the governing National Party is lifting
one of the last barriers protecting white privilege.
   De Klerk has promised to abolish all discriminatory legislation,
including laws prohibiting blacks from residing on or owning
property in much of the country. Those measures, along with the
ones that segregate public schools and the political system, are
the major remaining apartheid laws.
   The Separate Amenities Act became law in 1953 and was repealed
by Parliament in June. Local communities were given until Oct. 15
to comply.
   In places like Sasolburg, a conservative town about 50 miles
south of Johannesburg in the country's heartland, many white
residents oppose the government's actions.
   ``I think if they open everything up, the standard of living is
going to drop,'' said Trevor Engelbrecht, 43, a taxi driver.
   Under the new Sasolburg law, the small number of black employees
living in white households or worker hostels inside the city of
27,000 can use the pools. But not blacks living in the adjacent
township of Zamdela, which like most black areas has few
recreational facilities.
   ``You must take some sort of a measure to prevent
overcrowding,'' said Kim LeRoux, head of the town's community and
development services. He conceded that the end of whites-only
regulations Monday prompted the new law.
   Several blacks interviewed on the town's streets were unaware
the Separate Amenities Act would end Monday. They also showed
little interest in the new law restricting use of the pools to
residents.
   ``It's not right, it's unfair,'' said George Mkhwanazi, 40, who
works in Sasolburg but lives in Zamdela. But he said he had no
plans to use the city pools anyway.
   The Conservative Party has become the main white opposition to
the National Party with its calls for strict segregation, including
separate facilities for blacks and whites.
   ``To our way of thinking, the facility provided by (taxpayers)
should be controlled in such a manner so that the ratepayers should
be able to enjoy them,'' said Clive Derby-Lewis, a top Conservative
Party official.
   He compared the Sasolburg law to similar restrictions in other
countries, where city taxpayers have exclusive use of recreational
facilities.
   The Conservatives control 101 of 150 town councils in the
Transvaal Province of northern and eastern South Africa, but few in
other areas. Other restrictive measures reportedly adopted in some
towns include a library fee for non-residents.
   Derby-Lewis said such regulations would effectively bar
outsiders.
   A few days before the laws changed, about two dozen whites
splashed in the water or sunbathed at the two-pool complex near
Sasolburg's business district. The only blacks inside were workers.
   Heine de Klerk, 23, said he supported restricting use of the
pools to residents because ``you only get the people who work
here.''
   ``Blacks will come here for a while, but then they'll stop,'' he
said. ``It'll die out.''

   Since its ancient days as the granary of the
Middle East, Iraq's fortunes have turned on the tides of trade.
   International sanctions have changed the rules, and now Baghdad
urgently seeks ways to survive alone.
   Exhorting farmers to grow more and citizens to eat less, Saddam
Hussein's government is trying to wean Iraq from a deep dependence
on imports that range from sugar to spare parts, U.S. and British
analysts say.
   With Iraq's veil of secrecy drawn even tighter since the
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, however, no outsiders have a clear
picture of how its economy is faring.
   Many analysts believe Iraq can make do until the spring harvest,
despite its pre-invasion economic straits and the increasing
hardship sanctions will cause.
   ``Assuming their ability to substitute, produce more and ration,
it's conceivable they could last six months,'' said Sharif Ghalib
of the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C.
   It won't be easy, said Jonathan Crusoe, who analyzes Iraq for
the Middle East Economic Digest, because ``they've been addicted
too long'' to imports.
   Iraq once was home to the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia,
which built an intricate irrigation system between the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers. It is a developing country, but not a poor one.
   Per capita annual income is equivalent to about $3,000 and the
Planning Ministry estimated the 1989 gross national product at
$66.19 billion, up from $57 billion in 1988.
   With its abundant oil, water, and rain-fed farmlands of the
north, Iraq is regarded as having the second greatest potential for
economic development in the region, after Iran.
   Development has been hampered, however, by the costly eight-year
war with Iran that began in 1980, rigid state economic controls and
extreme dependence on imports and the oil sales needed to pay for
them. Its foreign debt is estimated at $75 billion.
   This year, Iraq was spending liberally on the military and
industrialization despite declines in the price of oil, which
provided 96 percent of its income.
   ``The picture was one of a growing cash squeeze at a time when
the Iraqis were trying to provide both guns and butter,'' said
Ghalib, director of the Institute's African-Middle East division.
   Since the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq has become virtually an
island economy, its foreign assets frozen and oil sales blocked by
U.N. resolutions. In retaliation, it is refusing to repay all
foreign debts.
   Analysts say the lack of money shouldn't be a problem for Iraq,
since there is little for it to buy, unless smuggling increases or
the United Nations allows it to receive humanitarian food
shipments.
   Iraq had about $6.5 billion in gold and foreign exchange at the
time of the invasion, the Institute in Washington said, but it does
not know how much of that was frozen abroad. The Iraqis are
believed to have stolen $1.6 billion in Kuwaiti gold and currency.
   According to the analysts, the key to Iraq's future lies in its
factories and farms, now dependent on imports. Iraq has progressed
from making simple goods like bricks and blankets 50 years ago to
heavy industries, including a petrochemical plant.
   Saddam has tried to expand domestic industry and farming. ``Let
us think of ourselves as a country without oil,'' he said in 1987.
   In 1989, however, manufacturing accounted for only 14 percent of
gross domestic product. The country depends heavily on foreign
equipment, parts and expertise, as illustrated by the estimated 1
million foreign workers and relatives who were in Iraq.
   Few details on industry are available, particularly because the
war with Iran put civilian industry undr military authority.
   A forthcoming report by the Middle East Economic Digest says
``There is no short-term way that Iraq can start or increase
domestic output'' of either spare parts or industrial equipment.
   Despite Iraqi claims that babies might starve, the analysts say,
no one has gone hungry because of the sanctions. Iraq imported
75-80 percent of its food, however, and is vulnerable.
   ``Extreme hardship will likely be apparent by the end of the
year,'' agricultural analyst Susan Epstein wrote in a Sept. 25
report for the U.S. Congress.
   Still, with rationing and substitutions such as potatoes for
rice and dates for sugar, the population of 17.4 million could last
six months, she said. The departure of thousands of foreign workers
also will help.
   No shortages are apparent so far. Vegetables, harvested in the
fall, are plentiful and melons, dates and other fruits abound. This
summer's wheat harvest was said to be double that in 1989, a
drought year.
   Meat, other grains and several staples are a problem.
   Rationing of cooking oil, sugar and bread began six weeks ago
and, two weeks later, allowances were reduced by up to half.
Livestock and chicken, an Iraqi favorite, depended on imported
grain and may have to be slaughtered.
   ``Tables should not be crowded with various types of food and
fruit as they used to be,'' Saddam told Iraqi women Aug. 12.
   His government has tried to inspire farmers by exempting them
from military service and paying more for maize and other staples,
the Digest reported.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress involved with the peace
talks in Angola are being courted by two rival suitors: Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James
Baker.
   Shevardnadze has written two Democratic representatives
proposing that Moscow and Washington stop aiding their rival
clients immediately so that Angola's 15-year civil war can be
brought to an end.
   Baker, who in the past has rejected this Soviet proposal, wrote
lawmakers urging them to keep supporting the anti-government rebels
so that the Soviet-backed government stays at the negotiating table
until peace is achieved.
   The United States and Soviet Union have started to cooperate
this year on Angola, and chances look better than ever that a
settlement can be reached. But the United States still sends UNITA
$60 million annually in weapons, and the Soviets back the Luanda
government with about 10 times that amount.
   The United States argues that if it stops the aid now, the
government would be left with a massive advantage over the rebels
and might exploit that to wiggle out of peace talks.
   In a memo last week to the House Republican leadership, Baker
argued that just when negotiations are bearing fruit would be ``the
absolutely worst time'' to halt aid. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
made the same argument here earlier this month in talks with
lawmakers.
   Shevardnadze, however, wrote that a mutual aid suspension would
``disabuse them (each side) of the illusion that by pursuing
interminable military operations they can buttress their
negotiating positions, (and) would prompt them to take a more
constructive attitude at the negotiations.''
   Aid should be cut now, even before the sides agree on a
cease-fire, he wrote Reps. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., and Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif. The Sept. 23 letter, released Friday by Fenton
Communications, which represents the Angolan government, was
responding to a letter from the two Democrats.
   Wolpe, chairman of the House subcommittee on Africa, and
Dellums, chairman of the Congressional Black caucus, are among a
growing number of lawmakers opposing the Bush administration's
renewal of aid to UNITA in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Arms for UNITA enjoyed wide support in Congress over the years,
as long as they were viewed as helping to block Soviet influence in
various parts of the world.
   But with the decline in Soviet power and in its massive military
support of Third World wars, Congress has begun to rethink U.S.
support for several such wars, including those in Afghanistan and
Cambodia.
   The House Intelligence Committee defeated a proposal last month
to cut off aid to UNITA, but only after Baker made hurried calls
from Moscow to several committee members urging them to reconsider.

   A homebuilder has donated $31,000 to keep
this city's Christmas display lit after the city council pulled the
plug and found itself being called Scrooge.
   Bill Milburn, owner of Austin's largest homebuilding company,
said he wrote the check because he and his family have always
enjoyed the brilliant Zilker Park Trail of Lights.
   Mayor Lee Cooke wrote a memo Friday to his ``fellow Scrooges''
telling the council about the contribution. ``This might be the way
to fund a lot of city projects,'' Cooke said.
   Council members cut funds to the annual holiday attraction in
order to pay for a tree-planting position. They were then inundated
with calls in support of the display.
   Council member Bob Larson said he was tired of being called
Scrooge everywhere he went and wanted his colleagues to reconsider
their action.
   Michael Corroccio, who helped design the exhibit 10 years ago,
praised Milburn for the donation. ``It really ensures the future of
the trail. Now we can go full steam ahead,'' he said.
   The ``Trail of Lights,'' featuring displays of various Christmas
themes, attracts thousands of viewers each year.

   People used to leave their doors unlocked and
take the kids for strolls along the city's quiet streets north of
downtown. Not anymore. A mysterious serial killer who has claimed
five female victims - and who police say will likely strike again -
has driven people inside, behind locked doors and windows.
   There, some people have taken to bathing with revolvers nearby,
aware that some of the victims were in the shower or had just
gotten out when they were stabbed to death with their own kitchen
knives.
   Outside, the city's normally peaceful University City and
Clairemont neighborhoods are filled with fear.
   ``I can't go out in the street or open the door,'' said Lupe
Reyes, a 23-year-old live-in baby sitter in University City.
``Before, we could take the children out to play and we could take
walks. But now we can't go out because of the fear that he's out
there.
   ``Sometimes the doors along the back used to be open,'' she
said, motioning to the back of the house. ``Now, day and night,
they're closed.''
   Reyes, like so many other women in the neighborhood, is wary -
frightened of the man who since January has boldly entered the
homes of five women between the hours of 8 a.m. and 1 p.m.
   In each instance, the killer entered through an unlocked door or
window, say police who are conducting the largest manhunt in San
Diego history.
   About 30 investigators in the nation's sixth-largest city are
sifting through more than 2,000 leads that came in after the most
recent murders, the Sept. 13 slayings of Pamela Gail Clark, 42, and
her 18-year-old daughter, Amber.
   Amber Clark and three other victims were brunettes, aged 18 to
21. Authorities speculate that Pamela Clark was killed because she
happened to be home with her daughter.
   The first victim was 20-year-old Tiffany Paige Schultz, a San
Diego State University student who moonlighted as a nude dancer.
She was slain in her Clairemont apartment in January.
   Janene Marie Weinhold, 21, who lived just two blocks away, was
killed two months later. Holly Suzanne Tarr, an 18-year-old high
school student from Okemos, Mich., was in town to visit her brother
when she was killed in April.
   Experts have put together a profile of the killer that describes
him as a disorganized opportunist who probably picks his victims on
the spot. They say the fact he uses the victims' own knives as
weapons indicates the murders aren't well planned.
   A maintenance man who interrupted the attack on Tarr described
the killer to police as 14 to 23 years old, with a dark complexion,
close-cropped hair and a medium build.
   But aside from that information, authorities say they have
little to go on.
   ``We don't have the lead that we need,'' said police Capt. Dick
Toneck. ``We're still waiting for someone to come forward and say,
`I know this person.'''
   In the meantime, Toneck said, police believe the killer will
strike again.
   ``I don't think this person is going to leave town,'' Toneck
said. ``I believe he's going to do what he's doing. We're fully
aware of the time constraints. We're fully aware that this could
take place anywhere.''
   Many residents agree, adding they have taken precautions to
protect themselves. Some people have even moved away.
   ``After the second murder there was a stream of moving trucks
going up and down the street,'' said Victoria Ross, 27, who lives
across the street from the apartment complex where Schultz was
killed.
   Ross stayed, but she has become far more cautious.
   ``Every time I come up the stairs I watch around the bend,
thinking that since there were no signs of forced entry in any of
the murders that maybe he waited (outside for his victims),'' she
said. ``I watch in every direction before I get out of the car.''
   She also keeps an eye out for strangers, notes the license plate
numbers of cars in the neighborhood and studies newspaper stories
about the killings.
   ``I want to catch him,'' she said.

<HEAD>Voters in Nevada, Oregon, to Decide Abortion Rights Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voters in two states considered abortion
rights strongholds, Nevada and Oregon, will have their convictions
tested on Election Day.
   In Nevada, a referendum backed by pro-choice advocates would
preserve a state law protecting abortion rights, prohibiting any
change in the law except by a direct vote of the people. That would
keep the matter out of the hands of the state Legislature and
governor.
   One opinion poll found broad support for the pro-choice side.
   Oregon voters, meanwhile, face two anti-abortion measures.
Measure 8, sponsored by the conservative political group Oregon
Citizens Alliance, would ban abortions except to prevent the death
of a woman or in reported cases or rape or incest.
   The less stringent Measure 10 would require Oregon doctors to
notify a parent at least two days before performing an abortion on
a minor. The measure is sponsored by a coalition that includes
Oregon Right to Life.
   In Oregon, activists on both sides agree the contest is drawing
national attention because of the state's reputation as an abortion
rights sanctuary.
   Twice previously, in 1978 and 1986, Oregon voters beat back
ballot measures aimed at restricting state funding for abortions.
The outcome next month may be different; polls suggest Oregonians
may defeat the tougher Measure 8 but favor Measure 10.
   ``Anti-choicers know that because of Oregon's long tradition, if
they can win here, they can win anywhere,'' said Jeanette Turk,
executive director of the No on 8 and 10 Campaign.
   Lon Mabon, chairman of the rival Oregon Citizens Alliance,
agreed: ``If we can do it here, it would be sort of a `Remember the
Alamo' to all pro-life groups in other states.''
   ``I think people will be watching what happens in November to
see what's the mood of the nation,'' said Kathryn Kolbert, an
attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in New York.
   Nevada statutes currently permit abortions by a physician within
the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions can be performed after
that only to protect the life or health of the mother.
   In Nevada, Campaign for Choice organizers gathered more than
75,000 signatures in its successful petition drive.
   The push to preserve Nevada's abortion statute followed a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling last year that gives states more latitude in
limiting abortion rights granted in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Nevada adopted a parental notification law in 1985, but its
implementation has been barred pending a ruling by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on its constitutionality.
   Campaign for Choice chairwoman Maggie Tracey the petition drive
was spurred by Gov. Bob Miller's anti- abortion stance.
   When he said he would sign a bill changing the abortion law, she
said, ``that's when we decided not to gamble and get the matter
before the voters.'' Choose Life '90, a statewide anti-abortion
organization, wants the Legislature to debate the matter. The group
is targeting Nevada's large Mormon and Roman Catholic populations
to help defeat the referendum.
   ``We are trying to cover the entire state and reach every voter
two or three times,'' said Choose Life organizer Janine Hansen.
   Another group, Nevada Physicians for Life, argues abortion
promotes the practice of ``induced death'' and will lead to
widespread use of euthanasia to rid society of the elderly and
handicapped.
   Laura FitzSimmons, a Campaign for Choice attorney, said a poll
of 600 registered voters by her group found 77 pecent think
government should stay out of the controversy. Sixty-eight percent
supported a woman's right to choose an abortion, while 24 percent
believe abortion should be outlawed.
   In Oregon, a recent telephone survey of 600 registered voters
conducted for The Oregonian newspaper in Portland found that 62
percent opposed a state abortion ban.
   But the same poll found 63 percent in favor of Measure 10
requiring parental notification.
   The ACLU's Kolbert said the organization is opposed to the
parental notification measure.
   ``The real intent here is to prohibit abortion,'' she said.
``Anti-abortionists use this as a first step towards that goal.''
   Unlike Nevada's parental notification statute, Measure 10 does
not include a judicial bypass clause allowing a minor to obtain
court permission for an abortion if she can show that telling a
parent is either impossible or would endanger her.

   The Rev. Arthur Gustafson shuffled to the
pulpit of his small church, just like he does every Sunday. The
pews were empty, just as they are on most Sundays.
   Gustafson, the 78-year-old leader of the Emmanuel Evangelical
Covenant Church since 1947, is a pastor without a congregation; a
preacher with no one to preach to, a shepherd without a flock.
   But still he preaches.
   ``If no one is here, God is here and he hears prayers,''
Gustafson said, looking across his empty church in this central
Wisconsin community of 9,500 people. ``I felt I heard the Lord say
to stay so I stayed.''
   One by one, church members have drifted away, and the last
member of his congregation left town about two years ago. Even his
church building, owned by the Central Conference of the Evangelical
Covenant Church in Chicago, is for sale.
   ``Sometimes, we have a number of visitors. A family from Pine
River has been coming fairly regularly,'' Gustafson said, a smile
covering his bearded face.
   ``When someone is here, I am encouraged,'' he added. ``When they
are not here, I just feel this is the way it is and this is the way
I accept it. There's a lot to thank the Lord for.''
   Gustafson is the church's sole supporter, donating some of his
Social Security check and an investment that earns $62 a month. The
Park City Baptist congregation in Merrill helps with the bills by
leasing Gustafson's church for services Sunday morning and evening.
   The church was formed almost 100 years ago to meet the needs of
Scandinavians settling in central Wisconsin. Since he's been
pastor, the congregation seldom exceeded 30 people, he said. ``It
has always been a small struggling church.''
   These days, Gustafson, a frail man of slight build, struggles
with his health, too. ``My hearing isn't so good. I wear a couple
of hearing aids.''
   Every Sunday, Gustafson prints six church bulletins, listing the
order of worship and a few announcements.
   His service is simple. He reads the Bible, gives a short sermon
and sings. For hymns, he plays the melody on a piano with his right
hand, faintly singing the words.
   Paul Nulton, pastor of the Christ United Methodist Church in
Merrill, believes Gustafson hasn't retired because his church and
its rows of pews with cracking paint are like family.
   ``If he quit preaching, he would die,'' Nulton said. ``He
doesn't have a family. He doesn't have any other reason to be Art
Gustafson unless he is a preacher.''
   Other ministers understand Gustafson's devotion and realize that
for him to get active in another thriving congregation would be
difficult, Nulton said.
   ``It would be kind of like a 78-year-old person joining a new
family because his old family died off. It just doesn't work that
way,'' Nulton said.
   Gustafson became a minister after becoming disgruntled with his
career as a Chicago banker more than four decades ago. He said he
had problems because he believes lending on interest is a sin.
   The Lord will tell him when to retire from the pulpit, he adds,
saying church leaders have urged him to move into a retirement
center in Chicago and continue his ministry there.
   ``We will just have to wait and see. You know, it is interesting
how we discover the Lord's will. I seem to hear the Lord say very
definitely that I should stay. And that is the last word I seem to
have.''
   Last Sunday, Gustafson prepared enough wine for 12 people to
drink during communion, the church's celebration of Jesus Christ's
last supper with his disciples.
   No one showed.
   ``I always like to have plenty,'' he said, smiling.

   Vaudeville singer and dancer Julia Rooney
Clinton, once known as the ``princess of hoofers,'' died of
complications from old age. She was 102.
   Miss Rooney was the daughter of singer-dancer Pat Rooney Sr. and
his ballerina wife. Like her three older siblings, she pursued an
early career on stage.
   ``You only had 12 minutes, and when you got out there, if you
didn't grab your audience right now, you didn't get them,'' Miss
Rooney said in 1983. ``We got them, because the minute we hit the
stage, we were fun, we were fun.''
   She debuted in an 1895 production of ``Rip Van Winkle,'' and her
first vaudeville appearance came in 1902 at Keith's Union Square in
New York.
   In 1904, she toured in Ziegfeld's production of ``Mam'selle
Napoleon,'' and the next year appeared with her sister Josie as
Hansel and Gretel at Hammerstein's Victoria in New York, a top
vaudeville house.
   Miss Rooney married Walter Clinton, a singer, on Christmas Day,
1915. With a 10-piece band, the couple performed for several years
as Clinton and Rooney.
   They moved to the Los Angeles area in 1930, and Miss Rooney
operated a dancing school on Hollywood Boulevard. She returned to
the stage in 1942 in ``Ken Murray's Blackouts,'' which ran for
eight years.
   Clinton died in 1966. Miss Rooney died Oct. 6 at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank. She had no survivors.

<HEAD>Who Would Replace Wilson? He's Not Saying</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Pete Wilson is feeling the heat.
   If he wins the California gubernatorial race next month, one of
his first duties will be to appoint a Senate successor.
   Wilson, a Republican, is not saying whom he has in mind, only
that he'll look for someone who shares his political views.
   ``When the necessity arises I will share it in detail,'' Wilson
said.
   Sherri Bebitch Jeffe, senior associate at the Center for
Politics and Policy at Claremont Graduate School, says the issue
puts Wilson in a no-win situation.
   ``He makes one friend and innumerable enemies,'' she said about
Wilson's dilemma if he makes a choice before the election.
   Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein are locked in a
neck-and-neck race for the state's top job. A recent poll showed
Wilson with a narrow lead of 47 percent to 42 percent for
Feinstein.
   Feinstein says she's more concerned about Wilson's attendance
record in the Senate than whom he'll choose as a successor, but she
has challenged him to reveal his choice.
   ``Will that successor be pro-life or pro-choice?'' she asked.
``Will that successor be pro-Medicare or (for) more cuts in
Medicare? Will that successor be pro-Social Security or not?''
   Speculation on the short list of possible successors includes
moderate former Rep. Ed Zschau, the GOP nominee who was narrowly
defeated by incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston in a race for
California's other U.S. Senate seat in 1986.
   Another is conservative television commentator Bruce
Herschensohn, who also ran for the Senate in 1986.
   Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono, the shorter half of the former
singing duo Sonny and Cher, is one of those who has expressed an
interest in Wilson's Senate seat.
   Wilson tries to make light of that.
   ``How about Cher?'' Wilson said when asked about Bono.
   Wilson is also fighting criticism that he's missing votes in
Washington.
   ``In the Senate, there are no golden parachutes,'' says
Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco. ``I don't know of any
other Californian who can take two months off to look for another
job.''
   Like the successor issue, Wilson's attendance record places him
in an uncomfortable political position: If he stays in California,
he gets accused of absenteeism; if he goes to Washington, he could
get tied to the budget mess.
   It's not uncommon for a member of the Senate to vote 99 percent
to 100 percent of the time. Wilson's attendance record was 92
percent in 1989. In the fall term, Wilson missed votes on the David
Souter Supreme Court nomination, Middle East resolutions and the
budget.
   He blames his absences on an appendectomy, time spent in
California after the San Francisco earthquake and the demands of
the current campaign.
   He said he's missed no votes on which his ballot would have
affected the outcome, and stressed he has kept in touch with the
White House and Senate leaders during the budget process to protect
California's interests.
   Responding to questions about his absences, Wilson says he'll
return to Washington to vote on a budget reconciliation bill.
Earlier, he had said he would return only if his vote were
critical.
   At a recent news conference, Wilson showed his irritation when a
reporter noted that at least 30 senators are up for re-election but
have still voted in Washington.
   ``I'm the only one who is running for governor of California,''
Wilson snapped. ``You cannot campaign for office in California if
you are in Washington.''

<TEXT>
   Jerusalem's worst nightmare came true last
week, in a shower of rocks and a burst of gunfire.
   Israeli police fired into a mob of Palestinians on hallowed
Temple Mount who had stoned Jewish worshipers, shattering the calm,
cautiously upbeat mood that had enveloped Israel since the Persian
Gulf crisis began.
   Despite Israel's efforts to keep a low profile in the crisis,
the international spotlight abruptly moved from Kuwait back to
Jerusalem. Nations in the U.N. Security Council took a break from
denouncing Iraq to return to their more familiar practice of
criticizing Israel.
   Worst of all, the United States joined in, making the rare
gesture late Friday of voting to condemn Israel and ask for an
investigation.
   Suddenly, the world seems less open to Israel's argument that it
is Arab militants like Saddam Hussein, and not Israel's treatment
of the Palestinians, that threaten stability in the Middle East.
   The Palestinian uprising, which flagged in recent months, seems
likely to revive. The Temple Mount bloodshed, in which least 19
Palestinians were killed, ``will escalate things much more because
you have both nationalist and religious emotions being played
out,'' said Daoud Khuttab, a Palestinian journalist.
   Acrimony rages within the Israeli establishment over the failure
of police to foresee trouble and their use of live ammunition.
   Police insist they acted properly, given that only 45 officers
were on hand Monday to repel a mob of up to 3,000 rioters who had
attacked peaceful Jews in a holy place on a holy day.
   Already, however, the Israeli press is reporting that very
senior officers probably will be fired.
   While insisting it was the victim of an Arab provocation, the
government has shown keen displeasure with the police. In an
unusual step, it scuttled an internal police inquiry into the
shootings and set up an outside investigation.
   The probe is less weighty and high-level than critics demanded,
but much more credible than leaving the police to investigate
themselves.
   Whatever the commission finds, it is unlikely to bridge the huge
gap that has always existed - and is even starker now - between
Jerusalem's Moslems and Jews, especially where the Temple Mount is
concerned.
   To Moslems, the flat-topped hillock is Haram es-Sharif, from
which the prophet Mohammed rose to heaven. The site of the Al Aqsa
and Dome of the Rock mosques, it is the ultimate bastion of
struggle against Zionism's inroads.
   To Jews, it is the site of the biblical temple destroyed by the
Romans. The Western Wall, all that remains of it, is a symbol of
Jewish rebirth as a nation and it is Judaism's holiest shrine.
   Since Israel captured the site from Jordan in 1967, a fragile
truce has prevailed whereby Jews don't pray on the Mount and the
police keep a distance from its mosques.
   A fringe group of zealots called the Temple Mount Faithful wants
to rebuild the Jewish Temple, but has been rebuffed by rabbinical
rulings, Supreme Court decisions and police firmness.
   The Palestinian uprising, now nearly three years old, has
sharpened everyone's sensitivities. So when the Faithful announced
they would march to the Mount on the Jewish festival of Sukkot, the
Arabs appear to have taken it as a real threat.
   Rocks rained down on Jewish women, children and men in prayer
shawls, causing panic and injuring 28 people.
   Israel calls it a planned provocation by pro-Iraqi Palestinians
to distract attention from the Persian Gulf. Palestinians say it
was a spontaneous outburst of religious outrage, to which police
responded with far too much force.
   According to Israel, the Arabs had prepared piles of rocks and
Moslem clerics incited the mob by loudspeaker. Moslem authorities
say the rocks came from a building site already there, and that the
mullahs were pleading for calm.
   Jews say they heard Moslems shouting ``Kill the Jews!'' Arabs
arrested by police said they heard Jewish zealots shouting ``Death
to the Arabs!''
   The Israelis are in a bind. If it was planned, as they say, why
didn't their vaunted secret services get wind of it? Why weren't
the police out in force to head off trouble?
   No Israeli outside the ultra-right fringe seriously contemplates
rebuilding the Temple; they know it would cause all-out war and
make Israel the world's outcast. Yet many Moslems are convinced it
is about to happen.
   Emmanuel Sivan, a Jewish scholar of Arab affairs at Hebrew
University, believes the government should condemn such groups as
the Temple Mount Faithful much more loudly, even though the Israeli
public does not taken them seriously.
   ``The Arabs don't read us properly and it's certainly mutual,''
he said in an interview.
   Teddy Kollek, the Jewish mayor of Jerusalem, says Israel has not
given the city's Arabs a sense of equality.
   ``Equal rights don't go along with yeshivot (Jewish seminaries)
infiltrating into the Moslem Quarter and yeshiva students urinating
on the heads of Moslems from the second floor to the first,'' he
told the newspaper Maariv, in characteristically blunt language.
   ``We've never excelled at generosity. We never gave them a
feeling of equality before the law. They were and remained
second-and third-class citizens.''
   Khuttab, the Palestinian journalist, believes the problem might
have been solved by giving a Moslem cleric a walkie-talkie with
which to assure the mosque congregation that no Temple Mount
zealots were coming to seize their shrines.
   He said in an interview, however, that ``there is absolutely no
communication.'' The zealots are allowed to pursue their goals with
impunity, Khuttab said, and ``there is clearly a feeling that the
Israelis are just indifferent to Palestinian and Moslem
aspirations.''

   Thousands of protesters hurled
firebombs and stones Saturday at riot police who blocked a
demonstration against government spying on civilians.
   The police fired tear gas to drive back 20,000 students and
dissidents who tried to march downtown after an anti-government
rally attended by more than 100,000 opposition supporters.
   The health of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, meanwhile,
deteriorated as his hunger strike against the government of
President Roh Tae-woo entered its sixth day. Aides said he might
have to be hospitalized.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' yelled students hurling rocks and
firebombs at police.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
   In southern Seoul, 15,000 students staged anti-government
marches. Students burned a U.S. flag at a street rally and
dispersed peacefully while police stayed at a distance, apparently
to avert violence.
   Protesters were demanding the dissolution of the Defense
Security Command military intelligence, which has conducted illegal
and widespread espionage on more than 1,300 civilians.
   In an apparent effort to divert attention from the domestic
political turmoil, Roh on Saturday said he was launching a war on
escalating crime and promised to take extraordinary measures to
crack down on criminals.
   At the rally, thousands of people waving white Korean flags
jabbed their fists in the air while shouting anti-Roh slogans.
Groups of radical students with red and blue headbands stood and
cheered.
   There was thunderous applause when about 200 dissidents, wearing
numbers to designate their alleged file at military intelligence,
marched onto the stage.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of leading opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, had been expected to speak, but doctors said the
66-year-old leader's health had deteriorated after six days without
food.
   Aides said Kim, a two-time presidential candidate, had lost 13
pounds since his fast began. Kim began his hunger strike last
Monday to demand reforms from the government and call attention to
the spying scandal.
   The turmoil comes in the second month of a boycott by the 78
opposition members of the 299-member National Assembly. The
opposition resigned in August, charging the government with
railroading bills and curtailing reform.
   Roh fired the defense minister and head of military intelligence
last week. The new defense minister promised reforms.

   To chants of ``Long live the Emir!''
Kuwait's royal leader convened a conference of Kuwaitis in exile
Saturday, declaring that the meeting sent a stern message to
Baghdad.
   Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah choked with emotion at the cheers
from more than 1,000 Kuwaiti refugees who gathered in Jiddah for
the three-day conference.
   ``With this meeting, oh sons of Kuwait, you are affirming to the
unjust enemy and to the entire world the unity and cohesion of the
people of Kuwait in confronting the occupation and categorically
rejecting it,'' he said.
   ``This conference is the most eloquent response to your enemy
who usurped your homeland.''
   The crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, also addressed the opening session and promised more
democracy in Kuwait, once it is liberated.
   ``Liberation is our top priority, and after liberation we have
much to achieve,'' Sheik Saad told the gathering. ``Kuwait will
reinforce democracy and consolidate popular participation. The
political leadership will respond to the aspirations of the people
regarding the reorganization of the Kuwaiti house.''
   Outside Jiddah's Conference Palace, hundreds of youths raised
banners of support for the emir and shouted slogans calling for the
liberation of Kuwait.
   They included critics that before the invasion demanded a return
to the Western-style democracy prescribed in the 1962 constitution.
   The Kuwaiti parliament was suspended in 1986 because of pressure
from opposition deputies at a time when the country was the target
of a terrorist campaign meant to break Kuwait's support for Iraq in
the Persian Gulf War.
   Among the items to be discussed in Jiddah are ways to intensify
the opposition to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and
annexation.
   Conference members are expected to reject any Iraqi attempt to
include a national referendum on Kuwait's future as part of a
political solution to the gulf crisis.
   The prime minister expressed pride that all Kuwaitis, regardless
of their political commitments, have rejected the Iraqi occupation.
``The occupying Iraqi forces did not find a single Kuwaiti to
cooperate with them,'' he said.
   Reports that Baghdad would find the opposition figures ready to
form a government to replace the al-Sabah rule have never
materialized.
   But some of the critics, like prominent former parliament deputy
Ahmed al-Khatib, have started pushing for democratic reform even
before the end of the Iraqi occupation.
   Seham Yousef of the London-based Campaign to Free Kuwait said
the fact that the emir's government allowed criticism ``is a point
in favor of the government. Where else in the Arab world will you
find people being allowed to criticize and live?''

   The United States on Saturday urged the people
of Lebanon to support President Elias Hrawi who has ousted his
fiercest rival and is trying to restore peace.
   A statement by the State Department said the United States
regretted the loss of 13 lives in the battle for Beirut that forced
Gen. Michel Aoun to end his 11-month mutiny earlier in the day and
flee to the French Embassy.
   ``We hope that this ends a sad chapter of Lebanon's history and
that the Lebanese people can now move toward reconciliation and the
rebirth of a united, sovereign and independent Lebanon,'' the
administration said.
   Aoun's departure removes a major obstacle toward implementing a
peace plan adopted last year by the Arab League for ending
Lebanon's 15-year civil war. But many enmities still exist not only
between Christians and Moslems, but among the various sects on both
sides.
   The State Department did not make any mention of Syria's
involvement in the fighting.
   Thousands of Syrian troops and hundreds of tanks joined Hrawi's
troops in a three-pronged ground assault on Aoun's enclave in
Lebanon's Christian zone. The attack began with two hours of Syrian
air and artillery bombardment of Aoun's palace east of Beirut.
   U.S. officials said they were uncertain to what extent Syria was
instrumental in Hrawi's victory. They said there had not been any
contact with Syria in recent days regarding plans for an assault on
Aoun.
   The United States and Syria have improved their ties
significantly since Damascus joined the international coalition
against Iraq and sent troops to join the multinational, U.S.-led
force in Saudi Arabia.
   Aoun's ouster is expected to make things easier for Syria, which
maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon and has been vilified by its
arch-rival, Iraq, for allegedly contributing to the instability in
Lebanon.
   Aoun had been supported by Iraq, and his removal is expected to
bolster Syria's stand in the anti-Iraq coalition.
   The United States has been urging Aoun for months to give up and
let Hrawi restore peace, but it informed Syria's and Lebanon's
governments last month that it opposed Aoun's removal by force.
   Nonetheless, the administration was pleased by the outcome.
   ``Now is the time for national reconciliation, and a free,
independent, sovereign Lebanon,'' the State Department said.
   It reiterated the U.S. call for all foreign forces to leave
Lebanon. Israel also maintains some troops in southern Lebanon.
   The American staff of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which was
evacuated last year when their safety was endangered by factional
fighting, will only go back once calm is restored, an official
said. For the time being, the embassy is staffed only with local
Arab employees.

   Nelson Mandela intervened to
stop a violent confrontation Saturday after police fired rubber
bullets and tear gas at hundreds of black youths.
   The African National Congress leader rushed to Elkah Stadium in
the black township of Soweto after riot police blocked some 700
youths who tried to march to a nearby police station. Five people
were injured by rubber bullets, but marchers refused to disperse.
   Police said they fired because the marchers did not have a
permit to stage a demonstration and ignored orders to disperse. The
marchers had been taking part in a rally to demand release of
political prisoners.
   Mandela protested to police at the scene and demanded they pull
back. He then met with police Maj. Gen. Johann Swart at the police
station.
   Police said they agreed to release 32 marchers who had been
arrested.
   ``I was concerned with defusing the situation, getting the
people behind bars released,'' Mandela said later at an airport
press conference before leaving for a visit to India, Japan and
Australia.
   Witnesses said Mandela's intervention calmed the situation.
Mandela later addressed the marchers and said the march would be
held next weekend.
   Mandela praised police official Swart, saying they often worked
together to solve problems in Soweto, the sprawling township
outside Johannesburg.
   ``It's easy for us to sort out difficult problems,'' he told
reporters.
   Mandela also accused the government of attempting to muzzle the
ANC while allowing itself freedom to express opinions and
criticism. He claimed the government violated an agreement with the
ANC not to disclose details of a meeting Monday on the political
situation.
   He accused government ministers of attacking the ANC and trying
to discredit the black opposition group. He said government actions
were a threat to efforts to begin talks on ending white-minority
rule.
   ``It is quite clear they regard it as a privilege on their part
to enter into agreements and then break them,'' he said.
   The ANC and the government have exchanged charges of duplicity
in recent days. They have disagreed over plans to release political
prisoners, the return of exiles and other subjects.
   But Mandela played down suggestions that the dispute was a
serious threat to peace talks. He said disagreements were
unavoidable and he believed President F.W. de Klerk was committed
to political change.
   ``I don't think anyone should be alarmist about this,'' he said.
   ``I am convinced Mr. de Klerk wants peace in this country. He
wants fundamental changes in this country.''
   De Klerk has promised to end apartheid and share power with the
black majority. Talks on sharing power are expected to begin early
next year.
   Mandela was released from prison in February after serving 27
years for his actions against the white-led government.

   Egypt gave heroes' funerals Saturday to the
parliament speaker and four security guards killed a day earlier in
an ambush, and suspicion for the killings centered on Iraq.
   Egypt has led Arab opposition to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Rifaat el-Mahgoub was the first Egyptian politician to be
assassinated since Moslem extremists killed President Anwar Sadat
at a military parade on Oct. 6, 1980.
   A sixth person shot in the attack, el-Mahgoub's driver, died
Saturday after being wounded in the stomach, back and arms, doctors
said.
   President Hosni Mubarak led a procession of about 1,000 mourners
at Saturday's state funeral in Cairo's Nasr City district, where
Sadat's procession also took place.
   Security was tight. Hundreds of military police in red berets,
white-uniformed security police and plainclothesmen were on hand.
   Under the constitution, the 64-year-old speaker was second in
rank to Mubarak, who has not named a vice president.
   Although there was still no claim of responsibility for the
attack, government and outside experts said they suspected either
terrorists sent by Iraq or Egyptian Moslem extremists.
   Hassan Abu-Basha, a former interior minister in charge of
internal security, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram that he
believed Iraq was behind el-Mahgoub's death.
   He said the perpetrators possibly belonged to the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a radical Palestinian faction led by
Abu Nidal that often engages in terror-for-hire.
   Recent reports said Abu Nidal, who split years ago with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, has moved his headquarters from
Libya to Iraq.
   But Abu-Basha, who was badly wounded by Islamic militants in
1987, said the killers probably were aided by contacts in Egypt.
   Al-Ahram, quoting police sources, reported last Monday that
local Moslem extremists had provided weapons and explosives to five
Palestinians from Abu Nidal's organization who were sent to Egypt
by Iraq on sabotage missions.
   The current interior minister, Abdel-Halim Moussa, last week
announced the arrests of 35 alleged saboteurs and warned of
possible terror attacks by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Moussa
said Egyptian officials would be targeted for assassination.
   Ibrahim Nafeh, chief editor of Al-Ahram and a confidant of
Mubarak, said in a commentary Saturday that el-Mahgoub ``was
assassinated because he was a prominent Egyptian political symbol.
The assassins wanted to tell their terrorist bosses that they
stabbed Egypt's stability''
   Egyptian security forces continued their dragnet for the
assassins Saturday. Policemen stopped motorcyclists on Cairo's
streets looking for the killers, who escaped on two Suzuki
motorbikes.
   At the funeral, security forces sealed off all streets leading
to the mosque where the service was held and lined the 500-yard
procession route.
   Mubarak, flanked by the speaker's son and the father of one of
the bodyguards, led the procession. Among the mourners was Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain, in Cairo on a two-day official
visit.
   Hurd, on the first leg of a tour in the region, met with Mubarak
before the funeral. He told reporters he and Mubarak had exchanged
views on the gulf crisis but gave no further details. Hurd is
scheduled to travel to Israel on Monday.
   Ceremonial units from Egypt's uniformed services spearheaded the
funeral procession, followed by a military band and two dozen
wreath-bearers.
   Four military jeeps rolled behind them, carrying the security
men's coffins drapped in Egypt's red, white and black national
flag.
   A wagon drawn by three pairs of black horses bore el-Mahgoub's
coffin, also wrapped in the flag. Immediately behind came two
officers carrying the slain official's decorations on black velvet
cushions.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun, the self-styled
liberator of Lebanon, plunged the country into some of the worst
bloodshed and destruction in its 15 years of civil war.
   In the last 25 months, the strong-willed Maronite Catholic
general has taken on all comers - the Syrian army, Moslem militias,
Lebanon's new government, even fellow Christians he considered a
threat to his authority.
   In the end, the Syrians unleashed their military might to force
him into surrender and remove a major obstacle to efforts to
implement an Arab League peace plan.
   President Amin Gemayel made Aoun army commander in June 1984. At
49, he was the youngest man to hold the post since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun, 55, moved center stage Sept. 22, 1988, when Gemayel,
ending his 6-year-term with parliament unable to elect a successor,
appointed the general interim prime minister.
   Moslem leaders rejected Aoun's appointment. Syria and the
Moslems recognized Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,
citing an unwritten convenant in force since independence under
which the president is always a Maronite and the premier a Moslem.
   In the political vacuum, two governments emerged, both claiming
legitimacy.
   In April 1989, Aoun sought to impose his authority by ordering
the closure of all illegal ports run by militias. The Syrians and
the Moslems responded by blockading the Christian enclave north of
Beirut.
   Within days, Aoun launched a ``war of liberation'' to drive the
Syrians out of Lebanon. The Syrians were in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   For six months, Aoun and the Syrians fought the heaviest
artillery battles in the civil war. Nearly 1,000 people were killed
and more than 2,700 were wounded, mostly civilians.
   Aoun's 19,000 troops fought a lopsided war against the Syrians,
who have 40,000 men in Lebanon, and their Moslem allies.
   The carnage ended in September 1989 with a cease-fire.
   Ironically, it was Aoun's actions that galvanized the first
concerted Arab effort to end the civil war, in which some 150,000
people have been killed.
   In October 1989, the Parliament met in extraordinary session in
Taif, Saudi Arabia, and endorsed an Arab League plan to share power
equally between Lebanon's Moslem majority and the traditionally
dominant Maronites.
   Elias Hrawi was elected president Nov. 24 to implement the plan.
   Aoun refused to recognize him because of his Syrian backing and
rejected the peace accord because it did not provide for the
complete withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon.
   Hrawi sacked Aoun as army commander and interim premier, but the
general refused to step down.
   ``The world can smash me,'' he declared in February, ``but they
can't force me to approve of Taif.''
   Despite the violence he unleashed, Aoun remained widely popular
among the beleaguered Maronites.
   On Jan. 30, Aoun began fighting the militia of Samir Geagea, a
one-time medical student who was the only Christian with the
firepower to challenge him.
   When the fighting halted several weeks later, Aoun's forces were
left with an 80-square-mile enclave northeast of Beirut, with no
outlet to the Mediterranean for supplies.
   Aoun was further isolated when Geagea recognized the Taif accord
and Hrawi's presidency.
   The end came swiftly early Saturday, when Syrian patience
finally cracked.
   Aoun always maintained he was fighting to kcck foreign armies
out of Lebanon and reunite his tortured homeland. His opponents say
he was on a power trip and disparagingly dubbed him ``Napol-Aoun.''
   Asked in a recent interview how he reconciled the death and
destruction he triggered in the country he claimed to be trying to
save, he said:
   ``Sometimes the innocent have to pay the price for liberty.''
   Over the years, the general survived several assassination
attempts, the last one Friday night when a gunman shot at him
during a rally. Aoun was not hit, but he appeared doomed.

<HEAD>Unoccupied Cruise Ship Takes on Water, Sinks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cruise ship that customarily steams up and
down the Delaware River with diners got hung up on a dock at low
tide early Saturday and sank.
   There was no one on board when the mishap occurred, the Coast
Guard said.
   The 105-foot Empress of Palm Beach was listing 70 degrees in 16
feet of water off Penn's Landing, about a third of it still
showing, said Lt. j.g. David Ford.
   The 5-year-old vessel got caught on the dock as tide reached low
ebb around 4 a.m., he said. Water poured in through hull fittings,
vents and exhaust ports, then came over the deck, he said.
   ``A gentlemen was driving by and saw the Empress listing over
and said, `Oh my gosh,' and called us,'' Ford said. A salvage crew
was called to right the boat, plug holes and pump it out.
   A Hudson River-style steamer, the Empress could accommodate 500
passengers. Its two Victorian dining rooms were decked out with
antique furniture, gilded mirrors and chandeliers.
   ``From what I understand, somebody was supposed to have their
wedding there today,'' Ford said. ``Somebody rained on their
parade.''
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war:
   
   April 13, 1975 - Following political and sectarian rivalry that
has simmered since independence from France in 1943, civil war
breaks out.
   April 12, 1976 - Syria, alarmed at Palestinian-leftist gains,
sends in troops to support the Christians. The Arab League endorses
the move in June with a peacekeeping mandate.
   July 1, 1978 - Syrian troops attack Christians in the worst
fighting in two years. At least 200 people are killed.
   April 29, 1981 - Syria moves missiles into Lebanon in response
to increased clashes with Israel, whose forces have intervened in
fighting between Syrians and Christians.
   June 6, 1982 - Israel invades Lebanon, bombing Syrian missile
batteries and besieging Moslem west Beirut, trapping the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Aug. 4, 1982 - Iran sends its Revolutionary Guards to Lebanon to
fight the Israelis as they tighten their siege of west Beirut. The
Iranian force reaches 3,000 men and trains Shiite Moslem fighters.
   Aug. 30, 1982 - PLO chief Yasser Arafat and his guerrillas
evacuate Beirut under a truce plan supervised by U.S., French and
other forces, who withdraw Sept. 10.
   Sept. 14, 1982 - President-elect Bashir Gemayel, a pro-Israeli
Maronite Catholic, is assassinated in a bombing. Israelis storm
into west Beirut.
   Sept. 16, 1982 - Christian militiamen massacre hundreds of
Palestinian civilians in Beirut's Shabra and Chatilla refugee
camps, an area under Israeli control. Lebanese leaders ask for
multinational peacekeepers to return and they are gradually drawn
into civil war.
   April 18, 1983 - The U.S. Embassy in Beirut is hit by a Shiite
suicide bomber, killing 63.
   Oct. 23, 1983 - Suicide truck bomb attacks by pro-Iranian
Shiites on U.S. and French bases kill 241 U.S. servicemen and 58
French paratroopers.
   Feb. 6, 1984 - Moslem and leftist militias seize control of west
Beirut, forcing out Christian army units. Rival militias battle
each other. Hundreds of people are killed.
   June 10, 1985 - The Israeli army completes its withdrawal from
Lebanon, but occupies a border strip patrolled by allied Christian
militiamen.
   Feb. 22, 1987 - Syrian troops deploy in west Beirut, ending
three years of militia anarchy during which dozens of foreigners
are kidnapped.
   Sept. 22, 1988 - President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ends
with Parliament unable to elect a successor. He appoints army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun interim prime minister. The Moslems
reject Aoun and remain loyal to acting prime minister Salim Hoss,
who governed under Gemayel.
   March 8, 1989 - Aoun, vowing to crush the militias, blockades
their illegal ports. Syrian-backed Moslems blockade the Christian
enclave, triggering six months of artillery battles that kill more
than 900 people. Aoun declares a ``war of liberation'' against
Syria.
   Sept. 22, 1989 - An Arab League-brokered cease-fire takes hold
and Lebanon's lawmakers meet in Taif, Saudi Arabia, seeking a peace
settlement.
   Oct. 24, 1989 - Legislators endorse the Arab League peace plan,
which cuts Maronite power and gives Moslems a greater say in
government.
   Nov. 5, 1989 - Parliament formally approves the Taif agreement.
   Nov. 24, 1989 - Elias Hrawi is elected president to implement
the Taif accord. Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi or the accord.

militias. More than 200 are killed before a mid-August cease-fire.
   Sept. 1 - Hrawi signs political reforms approved by Parliament
and warns that he'll move against Aoun if he continues his
defiance. Aoun rejects the reforms.
   Sept. 30 - Hrawi's predominantly Moslem army blockades Aoun's
enclave.
   Oct. 13 - Syrian and Lebanese government forces attack Aoun's
enclave, forcing him to surrender and seek asylum in the French
Embassy.

   High school students dressed in their
finest evening wear went to their homecoming dance on a muggy
Saturday afternoon. Boy Scouts in Kissimmee camped out all weekend
in a luxury hotel.
   And if the PTA in Palm Beach County has its way, children will
go trick-or-treating at midday, four days before Halloween.
   The reason: an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis.
   The sometimes fatal disease - transmitted by mosquitos who
prefer to bite at night - has forced Floridians to drastically
change habits and could affect the crucial tourist industry.
   Indeed, the worst outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis in
Florida in more than 13 years is causing more headaches than
statistics show.
   With more than 20 million visitors expected to flood the state
from October to March, the disease comes at a bad time for
Florida's multibillion-dollar tourist industry.
   ``A woman called recently from Britain and asked, `Is it true
Disney World is closed and all flights to Orlando have been
canceled?''' said John Rutherford, spokesman for the Orlando-Orange
County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. ``It's a live cannon out
there.''
   Disney World responded to the threat by upgrading its already
rigorous mosquito-control spraying, Disney spokesman John Dreyer
said. He added that the nation's top tourist attraction has ``never
had a mosquito problem.''
   But Dreyer conceded the threat forced cancellation of the
evening water pageant, closed the water parks an hour early and
sent the thrice-nightly lakeside luau indoors.
   Travel industry officials say few vacations have been canceled,
but visitors' bureaus reported receiving dozens of phone calls from
worried vacationers, travel agents and meeting planners.
   County health officials counseled calm.
   ``There is no reason to feel panicked,'' said Larry Rhodes,
executive director of Manatee County Mosquito Control District on
Florida's West Coast. ``The chances of contracting the virus are a
little better than winning the lottery.''
   Florida health officials said Friday that 36 people have gotten
the disease and 16 other people are presumed to have it. About 15
people have been hospitalized and two were in comas as of Friday.
   Symptoms include headaches and fever, similar to flu symptoms.
But the disease also can lead tocoma and death resulting from
brain inflammation. Eight people died during the last severe
Florida outbreak of encephalitis in 1977.
   The present outbreak has forced intensive neighborhood spraying
and provoked angry debates in areas plagued with mosquito problems.
   Public schools in several counties banned all activities after
5:45 p.m. and parks were closing before dusk.
   Laura Vertolli, the 17-year-old girl who heads Boca Raton High
School's homecoming committee, felt her efforts had been sabotaged
after the ball had to be moved to a Saturday afternoon.
   ``I think I ran out of tears,'' she said.
   Boy Scout Troop 95 from Kissimmee pitched tents in the
mosquito-free environment of a convention hall at the Hyatt Hotel.
   And Scout Troop 510, 35 strong in Indian River County - hardest
hit with 11 cases - planned to lay out sleeping bags inside their
community church retreat, cook on indoor stoves and roast
marshmallows in the center's fireplace.
   In Palm Beach County, which had three cases of encephalitis,
about 1,800 Little League football and soccer players were kept off
the fields.
   The closings also suspended the season for 75 adult softball
teams in the county.
   At least one player saw that as a blessing in disguise.
   Gary Ward, second baseman and coach for Automated Information
Management in West Palm Beach, said his team was 0-2, having
suffered humiliating losses by a cumulative score of 28-4.
   ``The way we started out,'' he says, ``the guys are feeling
pretty good about the suspension.''

<TEXT>
   The fountain in the living room had
to go. But real state developer Stefan Hemming says the rest of
Liberace's desert retreat will be restored with the spirit of the
pianist in mind.
   ``It was strictly Liberace fashion,'' Hemming said of
Spanish-style home's interior design. ``It was very colorful. It
was done some years ago. You'd do different things in the '60s and
'70s than you would today.''
   The entertainer, known as much for his outlandish lifestyle as
his music, invested heavily in real estate.
   By the time he died in 1987 from complications of AIDS,
Liberace's property included a mansion and shopping center in Las
Vegas, a home at Lake Tahoe and a five-story office building in Los
Angeles.
   He wanted Casa De Liberace in Palm Springs to become a museum of
Liberace memorabilia. But the idea struck a sour note with the City
Council, which rejected a request for a zoning permit because it
would have disrupted the ambiance of the old residential
neighborhood.
   Hemming, a San Francisco businessman, said he fell in love with
the house while attending a party there when the ``sultan of
schmaltz'' was still alive.
   After Liberace's death, he bought the 7,000-square-foot home -
at the reduced price of $750,000 - because he like the ``whole
feeling of it.''
   He hopes to have Casa De Liberace restored by Christmas.
   The work of Hemming and his crew of designers and crafts people
is a constant source of discovery.
   Take the bathrooms, for example. Hemming thought there were nine
of them - until he stumbled upon another adjacent to the laundry
room.
   ``I can't keep track of all them,'' he said chuckling.
   Then there are the wash basins - ``not a plain sink of any
kind.''And of course, there are ``hundreds of light bulbs
everywhere - thousands, probably.''
   Some of the restorative changes have been as simple as taming
the overgrown garden, fixing leaky faucets and polishing the
5-foot-tall French bronze chandelier. Hemming's also ordered custom
rugs to cover the lime and rust-colored cermic tiles in the living
room: ``It's a very busy pattern - a little goes a long way.''
   The biggest change, however, has been the removal of the
6-foot-wide octagonal fountain in the living room.
   ``It didn't belong there,'' Hemming said. ``He had it
disconnected and filled it with plastic flowers.''
   Since one can add little to a home with a bell tower, cloisters
and six fountains, Hemming plans no architectural additions.
   Memorabilia, however, is a different story. Even though he's
collected a few items from the neighbor next door who owns the
house where the entertainer's mother once lived, there is one thing
he has enough of for now.
   ``I have more candelabras than I have fountains,'' he said.

   Thanks to recent heavy rains, officials
have ended unprecedented water-rationing measures imposed last
month on pilgrims visiting the spring at this world-famous shrine.
   Under the rules imposed Sept. 19, visitors were asked to take
away with them only one small container of water. But officials
said Saturday that pilgrims once again could take as much of the
water as they could carry.
   The increased water supply was attributed to the recent rains
and the end of the main pilgrimage season.
   More than 4 million pilgrims come each year to Lourdes, where,
according to Roman Catholic tradition, the Virgin Mary appeared
repeatedly before a 14-year-old girl in 1858.
   A spring was found at the site, and thousands of people who
subsequently prayed and bathed in its waters said they were healed.
A medical bureau established at Lourdes has categorized as miracles
65 of the cures attributed to pilgrimages to the shrine.

<TEXT>
   Democrats who control both houses of Congress
are ready to battle over a bill that would cut the budget deficit
by $500 billion over five years.
   The House GOP are debating whether they should sit out the fight
because of the all-out opposition to higher taxes or offer a
substitute plan with almost no chance of passing.
   Senate Republicans are more inclined to side with President
Bush, who swallowed his no-tax-increase pledge in the interest of
slashing the deficit.
   ``If we could do it all through spending restraint, that would
be ideal,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
``That's not going to happen.''
   A showdown could come as early as Wednesday in the House and
Thursday in the Senate.
   House Democrats, trying to take back a big part of the wealth
that shifted into the hands of higher-income Americans over the
past decade, are pushing a $149 billion tax increase.
   Nearly two-thirds of that would fall on the 13 million or so
couples and individuals with incomes above $50,000 a year.
   In the Senate, where Democratic control is not nearly so solid,
the Finance Committee picked up backing from most of its GOP
members in approving a $142 billion tax increase, about 40 percent
of which would be paid by those earning more than $50,000. The 15-5
bi-partisan vote on the middle-of-the-road plan came early Saturday
morning.
   There is another glaring difference between the two bills.
   The liberal House plan wouldn't touch the gasoline tax - and
sponsors admit the reason is purely political. The Senate version
would raise the 9-cent-a-gallon tax by 9{ cents a gallon over the
next 15 months.
   The tax increase that House Democrats chose to replace the
gasoline tax would not be as obvious, but it would hit every person
who files an income tax return.
   It would forgo next year's annual adjustment in the income tax
rates and personal exemptions designed to offset inflation - to
prevent bracket creep that can give the government an
ever-increasing share of any cost-of-living pay raise.
   Thus, more income would be taxed at higher rates, the personal
exemption would be about $100 less than present law provides for
1991, and taxpayers would turn over another $36 billion.
   Both bills would raise taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, airplane
tickets and such luxury items as expensive cars, planes and
jewelry.
   Either would require the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries to
pay more each month for Part B insurance for doctors' bills and to
pay slightly more each year before Medicare starts picking up the
tab.
   Both would hit the insurance industry for about $8 billion in
extra taxes and require state and local government workers who are
not covered by a public pension to join Social Security.
   Both would cut more than $13 billion in agriculture spending.
   The Senate bill reflects the home-state interest of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee. It includes
$3.4 billion worth of tax incentives for the oil industry, aimed at
reducing U.S. dependence on imported energy.
   After nearly two years of bashing Bush's efforts to cut
capital-gains taxes, which apply to profits from investments, House
Democrats sought to broaden support for their bill by including a
capital-gains reduction of their own. But it's aimed to help
middle-income Americans, not provide the incentive to big-dollar
investors that some economists say is needed.
   The Bush administration was quick to endorse the Senate bill as
far preferable to the House Democratic plan.
   ``This bill is not perfect but it is satisfactory,'' said Sen.
Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior Republican on the Finance Committee.
   Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., reflected the views of most House
Republicans about any bill that would raise taxes when the economy
is sagging.
   ``I'm convinced this is really dumb,'' he said.
   There also is some discontent among Democrats.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., voted no because of the gasoline tax
increase, which he said discriminates against his and other rural
states. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., wouldn't vote for raising
Medicare charges while giving ``new tax breaks for wealthy oil and
energy investors.''
   The tax increases and Medicare changes are only a big piece of
the packages to cut the deficit, which without some action will be
around $300 billion in 1991.
   Other committees are making adjustments affecting other
programs.
   All the changes will be packaged into a ``reconciliation bill,''
which, after being passed by the House and Senate and signed by the
president, would be expected to reduce the deficit by about $40
billion this year and $500 billion over the next five years.
   Here, in round numbers, are the pieces of the package no matter
which version of the bill Congress finally agrees on:
   -Raising taxes in the range of $140 billion to $150 billion over
five years.
   -Slowing the growth of discretionary spending - programs that
can be reduced without changing any law - by about $182 billion.
Those programs range from the military budget to finding a cure for
cancer.
   -Reining in entitlements by about $106 billion. Those are
programs that guarantee benefits to any person meeting certain
qualifications and, thus, may not be cut without changing a law.
They include Medicare, food stamps and farm subsidies.
   -Those changes would be expected to reduce the government's
borrowing needs and, thus, cut its interest payments by as much as
$70 billion.

   Actor Danny DeVito, in town scouting locations
for a movie he is directing, was mistaken by a fan for fellow actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   ``Weren't you in `Total Recall?' '' the fan asked, referring to
the latest film by the more musclebound - and much taller -
Schwarzenegger.
   ``No, no, no, that's my brother,'' DeVito replied.
   The two actors co-starred in the movie ``Twins,'' which told the
story of twin brothers separated at birth.
   Pittsburgh is among a handful of cities DeVito is considering
for his film ``Hoffa,'' about vanished Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa.
DeVito will act in the movie as well as direct.

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) - Mike Love of the durable Beach Boys
says it's no longer cool to cut class and go surfing. It's better,
in fact ``Fun, Fun, Fun,'' to support teachers, he says.
   ``Teaching is the biggest problem confronting society. Every
problem stems from ignorance,'' Love said at his home here.
   ``The people in the front line of the war against ignorance are
teachers, so that whole teaching infrastructure needs to be
encouraged, uplifted, bolstered and reinforced,'' he said.
   The Beach Boy were scheduled to perform a benefit concert
Saturday that in part will aid Project Teach, which Love founded to
help recruit and aid new teachers.
   Back in the 1960s, the band was a favorite for its odes to
teen-age sun and fun. The lead character in ``Fun Fun Fun'' was a
girl who goes to a hamburger stand instead of the library and has
``fun, fun, fun, till her daddy takes the T-Bird away.''
   An album under discussion these days takes a more serous tone.
   ``There is a song title we are dealing with called `Trouble in
Paradise,' and I have another song title called `Only One Earth,'
'' Love said. ``It would have messages about the environment and
about humanity. It wouldn't be strictly, `Fun, Fun, Fun.' ''

   LONDON (AP) - Dozens of cards and telegrams, bouquets and cakes
were delivered to 10 Downing St. on Saturday but Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher wasn't home.
   She was at her country retreat, Chequers, quietly celebrating
her 65th birthday.
   After a rousing speech Friday winding up the annual conference
of her governing Conservative Party, the prime minister was
tackling government papers and preparing for a lunch meeting Sunday
with South African President F.W. de Klerk, a spokesman said.
   ``She never makes much of her birthday - it's another working
day,'' a Downing Street spokesman said.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Pele, the retired soccer
sensation, says he will run for president of Brazil in 1995. He
sees no need to start at the grass roots, either.
   ``To be a candidate after President Fernando Collor de Mello is
a challenge that I'm itching to accept,'' the 49-year-old legend
told the Jornal do Brasil in an interview published Saturday.
``There's no reason to start from the bottom and work up the
political ladder.''
   Pele said the government must move quickly to solve the
country's deteriorating educational and health care systems.
   He said his administration would be along the lines of a social
democracy. ``From what I've seen, socialist countries are the ones
with the best distribution of wealth in the world,'' he said.
   Pele led the Brazilian national soccer team to three world
championships. He ended his playing career in 1977 while a member
of the New York Cosmos.
   Since then, Pele has represented the Warner Communications
company and the government tourism agency Embratur and worked as a
TV sports commentator.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Jeans model Claudia Schiffer says she's a
quiet, serious, book-reading soul and not the sexy, wild woman she
portrays in ads.
   ``In the Guess? pictures I appear very wild, but I'm actually a
pretty quiet, serious person,'' the 20-year-old native of
Rheinberg, Germany, said Friday during a promotional appearance at
a department store that drew a crowd of 3,000.
   ``When you put on sexy clothes, you feel sexy.''
   Why is the Brigitte Bardot look-alike so popular?
   ``I think about it and I ask myself a lot, but the only thing I
can think of is I've just been myself,'' she said. ``I've always
been on time, I'm polite and nice. That's just the way I am.''
   Schiffer said that when not in front of a camera in skimpy
lingerie and bustiers, she wears faded jeans, a pullover sweater
and no make-up. And she's a selective reader.
   ``I never, never read a book unless it's a biography,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   Proposed cuts of more than $13 billion in the
agriculture budget over the next five years would mean smaller
government checks for farmers who plant federally subsidized crops.
   The plan would be part of the overall $500 billion deficit
reduction package of budget cuts and higher taxes announced by
congressional budget negotiators.
   Details were still being discussed Saturday, but a general
agreement by the House-Senate farm bill conference committee was
revealed late Friday.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
had no comment after the tentative agreement was reached.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs both the Senate
Agriculture Committee and the conference committee, blamed
``spend-now-save-later economic policies of the 1980s'' for the
deep cuts in government support.
   ``We have made every effort to make these painful cuts as fair
as possible,'' he said Saturday.
   Other savings proposals include:
   -Reducing subsidized wheat acreage by 15 percent and corn
acreage by 7.5 percent in 1991.
   -Shifting 25 percent of Rural Electric Administration direct
loans to private lenders.
   -Shifting Farmers Home Administration direct loans to private
lenders on a gradual basis until FmHA guaranteed loans are reduced
to a total $450 million by 1995.
   -Putting 1 percent user fes on loans for dairy, sugar, tobacco,
peanuts, honey, wool and mohair.
   -Establishing user fees for the Animal and Plant Health
Inspections Service.
   Like the proposal submitted to the farm bill conference
committee by House Agriculture Committee members, the agriculture
plan relies on a so-called triple base approach to save more than
$5 billion over five years.
   Under the plan, farmers would reduce the subsidized crops they
grow by 15 percent in each of the four years following the 1991
planting year.
   Farmers could use that 15 percent of acreage to grow wheat,
corn, feed grains, rice, cotton, oilseeds, industrial crops,
experimental crops or other commodities not already being grown in
substantial quantities.
   Proponents of market-oriented agriculture say that flexibility
allows the farmer to raise crops according to consumer demand
rather than because government subsidies are offered.
   They say that even though government subsidies will be down,
farm income doesn't have to suffer if market conditions are right
and farmers plant wisely.
   The Bush administration has favored that approach since the
beginning of negotiations on the farm bill last winter, but
Congress prefers the safety net to farm income that subsidies
offer.
   ``The House and Senate are being forced into a market-oriented
approach,'' said a staff member for the agriculture committees.
``There are no other places to cut so you have to go into the
commodity programs.''
   About $2.9 billion in savings would be achieved by averaging
deficiency payments over 12 months instead of the first five months
after harvest now used for most crops.
   Deficiency payments are the difference between market price and
the government-established target price. Immediately after harvest,
market prices are lowest, making that gap wider than later in the
year.

<HEAD>Compromise Resolution Condemned By Both Sides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel said Saturday that a U.N.
resolution condemning it for the deaths of 19 Palestinians was
unfair, and the Palestine Liberation Organization said it didn't go
far enough.
   The predictable reactions came a day after a rare unanimous vote
against Israel by the 15-member Security Council. The United
States, long a defender of Israel in the council, departed from its
usual stance to join in the censure.
   ``This is an incident which never should have happened,'' U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering said Saturday of last week's killings
on the Temple Mount.
   Malaysia's ambassador, Rasali Ismail, predicted that ``Beginning
from now, Israel's protective umbrella will begin to be steadily
removed.''
   In the resolution, which was passed just before midnight Friday,
the Council also asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
send a team of envoys to Israel to investigate the slayings last
week on the Temple Mount.
   The compromise resolution was worked out after five days of
marathon negotiations that pitted the United States against the
non-aligned members of the council, who supported the PLO.
   The PLO urged its allies to support a resolution that would have
sent a Council team to investigate the killings, as a first step
toward giving the Council a direct role in protecting Palestinians
in the occupied territories.
   But the United States let it be known it would veto that
resolution.
   A U.S. veto would have shattered America's fragile coalition
with moderate Arab states that support the U.N. economic embargo on
Iraq and have joined the multinational military effort to counter
new aggression by Baghdad.
   Moderate Arabs told the council in speeches last week that
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it
seized in the 1967 Middle East war, is as illegal as Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Some Western diplomats said privately that they believed the PLO
aimed to force a veto from the United States and thus split the
anti-Saddam alliance.
   ``The Security Council tonight grieves for those lost and
injured, condemns the acts of violence - both provocative and
reactive - and reaffirms the obligations and responsibilities,''
that Israel has to protect the safety and rights of Palestinians,
Pickering said Saturday.
   Last Monday's rioting in Jerusalem began when Arabs on the
Temple Mount threw rocks down onto Jews praying below at the
Western wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   Police moved in to disperse the Arabs, at first using tear gas
and rubber bullets, then live ammunition.
   In addition to the 19 Palestinians confirmed dead, 140 Arabs
were wounded and 30 Jews were injured.
   The U.N. resolution ``condemns especially the acts of violence
committed by the Israeli security forces resulting in injuries and
loss of human life.''
   It also refers to the injury of ``innocent worshipers'' in an
implied criticism of the Palestinian rock-throwers. The PLO had
fought to have that phrase removed.
   In Tunisia, a member of the PLO's executive committee, Yasser
Abd Rabou, said Saturday the resolution was ``insufficient'' even
though it condemned the actions of Israeli police.
   ``Unfortunately, we are expecting Israel to continue oppressing
the Palestinian people,'' said the PLO's U.N. observer, M. Nasser
al-Kidwa.
   A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Israel's Cabinet would have to decide whether to accept a U.N.
investigating team, which is to report back to the Security Council
by Oct. 24.
   The spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the U.N. action was ``without
any reason or justification'' since the police opened fire only
after the stoning.
   Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Johanan Bein, said
the resolution ``fails to condemn the cause of the tragic events in
Jerusalem - an unprovoked Arab attack on Jewish worshipers.''
   ``It is also regrettable that the Security Council fell into the
trap laid by Saddam Hussein and his PLO supporters, who inspired
the riots in order to divert attention from Iraq's aggression in
the (Persian) Gulf,'' he said.
   Israeli politicians on both right and left have said security
forces had advance warning of the riot, which they said was
planned, and failed to prepare adequately.
   France co-sponsored the U.N. resolution with Canada, Britain,
the Soviet Union, Zaire, Ivory Coast and Finland.

   A man was waiting for a bus when he saw a
familiar car roll by. It was his 1980 Chevrolet Caprice, the one
stolen 11 days earlier.
   Not even a customizing job that put a taxi light on the roof and
painted ``Crescent Cab Co.'' on the side could fool Bogdan Szetela.
   ``I think that was my car going by,'' a disbelieving Szetela
told a woman at the bus stop last weekend.
   ``And she said, `What are you going to do about it?''' he
recalled Friday. ``That kind of ignited my brain cells to work.''
   Szetela, 27, hailed another cab and gave chase. Several blocks
away, he jumped out of the cab and ``nonchalantly'' got into the
back of his own car, his heart pounding.
   ``I had to control myself,'' he said. ``I started chatting with
the guy, asked him where he's from and so forth - he's from Mount
Airy - nice weather we're having, isn't it?
   ``All the while, I'm checking out my car. There's a different
stereo and stuff, a meter, a radar detector, the works. Oh, and he
had a new steering wheel, a Monte Carlo. I'm saying to myself, `You
so-and-so, how could you do this to my car?''' Szetela said.
   His plan: find a police officer. He directed the cabbie to South
Street, where police frequently patrol, and spied one.
   ``I lunged from the back seat, put the car in park and grabbed
the keys,'' he said. ``I hopped out of car and told the cop,
`That's my car!'''
   Police weren't convinced - the identification number was
switched - until Szetela told them he left blue towels and a chess
set in the trunk.
   ``They popped the trunk, and sure enough,'' he said. Checkmate.
   It took another four days after the Oct. 6 incident to get the
car back. Crescent Cab says its drivers operate their own cars;
police are investigating but haven't arrested the driver.
   ``This is a first down here,'' said Detective Paul McKelvie.
   ``Sometimes God works in strange ways,'' said Szetela.

   The first Vietnamese leader to visit here
since the Vietnam War will hold talks in Washington this week,
officials said Saturday.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach will meet Wednesday at the
Pentagon with Gen. John Vessey, former head of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and now the president's special negotiator on U.S. servicemen
missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   Also attending the meeting will be State and Defense department
representatives, and Anne Mills Griffiths, who heads a coalition of
MIA families, said officials who asked not to be named.
   Thach's visit is another in a series of steps taken this past
year by the administration toward normalizing relations between the
two countries. Two weeks ago, Secretary of State James Baker met
with Thach at the United Nations in New York, the highest-level
talks between the sides since the war ended in April 1975.
   The administration insists the only agenda for Thach's visit is
to move along the accounting for an estimated 1,700 American
servicemen whose fate is unknown.
   The administration says restoration of relations would depend on
Vietnam's cooperation in the MIA issue and in resolving the civil
war in Cambodia.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge,
has withdrawn most of its 140,000 troops but must still sign a
peace treaty being worked out for signature in Paris.
   Vietnam's communist leadership hopes the Washington visit will
enhance the prospects for U.S. aid to the impoverished nation and
help end its international isolation. The government still rejects
democracy and represses opposition, but it has moved the economy
away from the failed communist model to a free-market system, which
has dismantled collective farming and improved urban living
standards.
   Thach will also meet with members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee at their invitation.
   Baker agreed to lift the usual travel restrictions on Vietnamese
diplomats, which limit them to a 25-mile radius of New York City,
so Thach could travel here.

<TEXT>
   Composer Gian Carlo Menotti has quit as artistic
director of Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in a dispute over control of
the event he created, but his decision may not be final.
   The 80-year-old founder of the annual festival said Saturday he
will stay on if there are changes in the board of directors. And
the board, which didn't accept his resignation when it was
submitted Friday, is hoping differences can be smoothed over.
   ``I no longer feel it is my festival, and this has been my life
for 15 years,'' Menotti said from his Manhattan hotel room. ``I
feel a bit lonely among them (the board members) ... I'm treated
like the clerk.''
   Menotti is best known in this country for his opera of the
Christmas story, ``Amahl and the Night Visitors.'' In 1977 he
founded the international arts festival in Charleston, S.C., two
decades after founding The Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, in an effort to bring together European and U.S. culture.
   ``I'm not going to go on in an organization where people stand
against me on artistic matters. I must feel my leadership is
accepted,'' Menotti said.
   Board Chairman Ross Markwardt said: ``Frankly, I'm going to let
the whole thing cool for a few days. Then I'll speak with his
agent, and try to open a dialogue that can result in some kind of
agreement.''
   Menotti acknowledged he could change his mind, though he sounded
resolute in his decision.
   ``They did not accept my resignation, but as far as I am
concerned I'm still resigned,'' Menotti said.
   One issue between Menotti and the board involves an $800,000
conceptual art exhibit planned for the 1991 festival. Menotti
opposes it.
   Menotti is in the second year of a three-year contract as
artistic director. Markwardt said it was unlikely Menotti would be
compelled to finish the term.
   ``I can't imagine that this board would have the stomach to do
anything to harm an 80-year-old patriarch who founded this
festival,'' Markwardt said.
   Menotti said he was meeting privately Saturday with festival
general manager Nigel Redden, who declined to comment about the
flap. Markwardt said he hoped this kind of private approach would
help ease tensions.
   ``It is much more appropriate that this not be turned into a
business arrangement, given the long personal relationships that
exist,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   In crushing rebel Gen. Michel Aoun,
President Elias Hrawi may have eliminated a main obstacle to a
peace plan for Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war. But his troubles
are far from over.
   Hrawi can claim that his authority now extends over much of his
ravaged country.
   But he depends on Syrian muscle, and goodwill, to maintain his
authority. That was underlined by the Syrian firepower needed to
hammer Aoun into submission.
   The Syrians, for their part, have a history of getting rid of
allies who don't do as they're told.
   Hrawi faces a tough time ahead in consolidating his control and
implementing the 1989 peace agreement, which is still viewed with
misgivings by many Moslems.
   Hrawi declared in a radio address Saturday that ``a new dawn for
the republic was born'' after Aoun fled the presidential palace in
Baabda, where he had his headquarters in an underground bunker.
   That could well be. But the Syrians still control 70 percent of
Lebanon. They have said they will withdraw from Beirut and other
cities to the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon in the coming months.
But they may never leave Lebanon altogether unless there is an
Arab-Israeli peace settlement.
   The Syrians see Lebanon, which was part of Syria under French
rule until 1943, as vital to their defensive strategy against
Israel.
   The Israelis occupy a border strip in south Lebanon, and they
won't withdraw while there are Palestinians and other Moslem
guerrillas operating in the southern panhandle.
   There are also several thousand Iranian Revolutionary Guards,
and various Palestinian factions, based in Syrian-policed east
Beirut.
   Getting rid of them will not be easy. The Arab League-brokered
peace accord agreed on in Taif, Saudi Arabia, provides for the
traditionally dominant Christians sharing power equally with the
Moslem majority.
   Hrawi last month formally signed political reforms into law. But
the Druse and Shiite Moslems still do not think they are being
treated fairly and many Maronites, the dominant Christian sect, are
loath to see their traditional privileges stripped away.
   The Shiites are also deeply divided between among themselves.
The Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been feuding for the last three years with the more secular,
Syrian-armed Amal militia.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed in the power struggle
for control of the Shiite community.
   Iran and Syria, its main Arab ally, recently brokered a new
cease-fire, but there are still scores to settle and an new
flare-up is more likely than not.
   The 200,000-strong Druse, whose stronghold is in the Chouf
Mountains overlooking Beirut, fear they will be squeezed out by the
biggest sects.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which carved out a
stronghold in south Lebanon after it was driven out of Beirut
bastions by Amal two years ago, also is not likely to pay much heed
to Hrawi.
   Under the peace plan, the militias are supposed to be disarmed
and disbanded. But for much of the civil war, they have basically
done what they wanted and carved out their own cantons. Disarming
them will not be easy.
   Only Syrian firepower keeps the lid on. Without it, Hrawi's
poorly armed forces would find it difficult to take on the veteran
street fighters.
   And even if political stability can be restored, Hrawi faces the
awesome task of rebuilding the shattered economy.
   Much of the infrastructure has been destroyed or damaged,
particularly in fighting triggered by Aoun's actions.
   Under the peace plan, the Saudis were slated to bankroll much of
the reconstruction. But Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has meant the
Saudis are too involved confronting Saddam Hussein and underwriting
a multinational force to bother about the Lebanese.
   Economists estimate Hrawi will need $21 billion for
reconstruction.

   Rebel gunmen killed a government
militia commander and seven of his men in a raid on a mosque in
Afghanistan's western state of Herat, state-run radio said
Saturday.
   Kabul Radio, in its English-language broadcast, said at least 22
people were injured, including a member of the Iranian Consulate in
Herat.
   Gunmen belonging to the Moslem resistance fighting the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul stormed the Blue Mosque Friday
and killed militia commander Zahim Ahmad and his men as they were
praying, the radio said.
   ``Extremists launched an inhuman and criminal attack on the
mosque and martyred eight people, including commander Zahim Ahmad,
and wounded 22 people,'' said the radio, monitored in Islamabad.
   Midia, the Pakistan-based news agency of the guerrillas'
government-in-exile, confirmed rebel fighters had killed Ahmad and
other ``notorious Communists'' but denied the attack occurred in
the mosque.
   ``The mosque was not damaged. The ambush took place on a road
north of the mosque,'' the agency said.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy
warriors, have been fighting for 12 years to unseat the
Communist-style government in Kabul.
   Ahmad, the leader of a militia force of about 5,000, was a
guerrilla fighter before he signed a non-aggression pact and
switched to the government's side three years ago.
   Ahmad wielded considerable influence with the provincial
government in Herat, which borders Iran and the Soviet Union. He
had been critical of the mujahedeen leaders based in Pakistan.
   Diplomatic and guerrilla sources in Pakistan say Ahmad's murder
could be linked to inter-militia rivalries or to avenge the murder
of another militia commander who was killed in a similar incident
in Herat in August. No one claimed responsibility for that attack.

   Israel was angered by the Security Council's
condemnation of the killing of 19 Palestinians but has not decided
whether to reject a U.N. investigating mission, a government
spokesman said Saturday.
   The council resolution Friday night condemned the ``violence
committed by the Israeli security forces'' in Monday's riot at the
Temple Mount. U.S. approval of the resolution appeared to mark a
shift in its policy toward Israel.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yizhak Shamir, said
the resolution was ``without any reason or justification'' since
police opened fire after a stoning attack by Palestinians that
injured more than 30 Jewish worshipers and police.
   He said that he did not know if the government would accept the
resolution's call for emissaries of the U.N. secretary-general to
investigate the deaths.
   ``I can't say if we will accept this mission. The Cabinet will
have to decide,'' Pazner said. The resolution would be discussed at
a Cabinet meeting Sunday, he said.
   Shamir said earlier that a U.N. investigation of the rioting on
the Temple Mount would infringe on Israel's sovereignty over
Jerusalem. The Mount, holy to both Moslems and Jews, is in Arab
east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War
and then annexed.
   ``Jerusalem is the pupil in the eye of the Jewish people. I
think it would be a real crime ... to allow anyone to damage the
sovereignty of a Hebrew Jerusalem,'' Shamir said in a radio
interview broadcast Saturday but taped before the Security Council
decision.
   The council's resolution did not specifically mention a U.N.
mission to Jerusalem, but referred only to a visit to ``the
region.''
   Nafez Essala, head of the Palestinian Center of Nonviolent
Studies in Jerusalem, praised the council's resolution but had
reservations about its real worth.
   ``If Israel says they won't accept the U.N. delegation, will the
U.N. impose an embargo or send troops to force Israel to accept it?
I don't think so,'' Essala said.
   Pazner said that the U.N. condemnation of Israel for the
Palestinian deaths - 19, 20 or even more than 20 according to some
versions - played into the hands of another of Israel's strongest
enemies, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a reaction to the Security Council
vote that warned the resolution could further inflame the Middle
East.
   ``One can only hope that the Arab extremists who formented these
riots will not view this resolution as an internationally
sanctioned license to further violence,'' the statement said.
   Questions have been raised in Jerusalem about whether the
rioting was planned by Palestinians or a spontaneous reaction to
rumors that a group of Jewish zealots was planning a march on the
Temple Mount.
   Israel officials first said Palestinians planned in advance to
hurl a barrage of rocks at Jewish worshipers below the Mount at the
Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
   But Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner later said he believed the
riot was spontaneous.
   The rioting was the bloodiest single incident in Jerusalem since
Israel captured the city's Arab sector from Jordan in 1967, as well
as in the 34-month Palestinian uprising.
   At least 760 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the revolt against occupation. An additional 278
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. Forty-eight Israelis have died in the
violence.

<HEAD>Woman Wins $10 Million McDonald's Prize, Then Gets Disqualified</HEAD>

   A woman named as the winner of a $10 million
prize in a McDonald's-NBC contest feels she got burned - she was
disqualified hours later because her daughter is a McDonald's
cashier.
   Instead of heading for a vacation in Puerto Rico, Thelma and
Charles Bellows are visiting an attorney. A McDonald's spokesman
said Saturday the couple apparently misunderstood the rules.
   ``It's been two day  of no sleep,'' Bellows said in a telephone
interview from his home in Kawkawlin, 120 miles northwest of
Detroit. ``We were honest about it. For $10 million, we could have
given the ticket to someone to claim it. But we were honest.''
   Mrs. Bellows, 49, was named on national TV Friday morning as the
winner in the ``McMillions on NBC.'' She received the winning
ticket, which was drawn Thursday, when she bought a meal at a
McDonald's restaurant in Auburn, Mich., where one of her six
children, Charlene Saunders, works.
   The couple spent Friday in Detroit with representatives from
McDonald's, taping a commercial that was to air Friday night. They
planned to buy a new house and furniture, and take a trip to the
Caribbean.
   ``I just can't believe it,'' Mrs. Bellows said in a statement
Friday. ``It's still a dream and it doesn't seem real yet.''
   At about 6 p.m., the dream fizzled. McDonald's told her she was
ineligible. Bellows said they told the contest auditors about their
daughter earlier in the day, but were told it didn't matter because
she does not live with them.
   However, Charles Rubner, vice president at the McDonald's Corp.
headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., said the auditors were unaware
Mrs. Bellows had a relative working at McDonald's when they
verified the winning ticket.
   ``It is clear that Mrs. Bellows did not understand the rules
that an employee's family is ineligible,'' Rubner said in an
interview. ``When she was asked if she had any immediate family
employed by McDonald's, she apparently misunderstood and said no.
When we learned otherwise, we told her.
   ``We're terribly sorry that the misunderstanding occurred,'' he
said.
   Rubner said the McDonald's rule about employees' families is not
a federal or state requirement, but a standard regulation in
company contests.
   In New York, NBC spokesman Curt Block said the network backed
McDonald's decision.
   Mrs. Bellows was too upset to talk to reporters Saturday.
   ``We still feel that we should get the winnings,'' said Bellows,
co-owner of RCL Construction Co., in Sanford. ``Our chances of
winning were the same as anybody else's.''
   The couple said they have contacted an attorney, but did not
elaborate.
   The jackpot rolled over to $11 million for Friday night's
contest. The game card with the winning number is announced each
night on an NBC prime-time program. The promotion began Sept. 24
and ends Oct. 22.
   The Bellows were offered a consolation of dinner and
accommodation at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Dearborn Friday night,
but they turned it down.
   ``We figured it would be better to just come home,'' Bellows
said.

   Pioneering journalist Douglas Edwards, a World
War II radio correspondent who became the nation's first network
television anchorman with CBS, died Saturday morning at his Florida
home. He was 73.
   Edwards, who spent all but 10 of his 56-year broadcasting career
with CBS News, died of cancer in Sarasota, Fla., CBS News
announced. He retired from the network in April 1988.
   Forty years earlier, then-CBS President Frank Stanton tapped
Edwards to anchor its nationwide TV news broadcast, titled
``Douglas Edwards with the News.'' He held the job for 14 years
before surrendering the seat to Walter Cronkite.
   The program won a Peabody Award for best television news in
1956, and the show - which began airing coast to coast five years
earlier - became the world's largest single news medium with 34
millions viewers.
   ``Because he was a pioneer and achieved so much as a
professional, Douglas Edwards is in the pantheon of news
broadcasters,'' said CBS News anchorman Dan Rather.
   Don Hewitt, executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' was an
associate director on Edward's nightly newscast.
   ``Along with Dave Garroway and Ed Sullivan and Jack Webb and
other pioneers, Doug ushered in the television era. ... Whatever is
good and right about TV news today, Doug Edwards can claim a lion's
share of the credit,'' Hewitt said.
   Edwards already had a decade of experience when he joined CBS
News in 1942. He became part of Edward R. Murrow's legendary London
radio staff as World War II drew to an end, and also served as
Paris bureau chief.
   In 1948, he joined Murrow and Quincy Howe in CBS' acclaimed
radio coverage of the presidential conventions.
   ``We did very well, the three of us, on those conventions,'' he
recalled later. ``Afterward, CBS asked me to go into television,
and I did it with some fear and trepidation, not because I was
nervous about being on television, I had done quite a bit of it,
but radio was the power, and I was pretty young at the time.''
   He made the transition smoothly, retired colleague Eric Sevareid
recalled Saturday in Washington.
   ``He was one of the very few who set the standards of
objectivity and cool-headedness for the anchor position. ... He
never tried to bend the news. When TV came along, with all its
emphasis on personalities, he was never one of those who tried to
act the news,'' said Sevareid.
   When he gave his last TV broadcast in April 1988, Edwards said:
``A deep bow of gratitude, love and respect to the men and women of
CBS News and to the company for which they stand. To you out there,
thank you for honoring me with your presence in my audience.''
   Edwards was born July 14, 1917, in Ada, Okla.
   He began his broadcasting career at the age of 15 on a radio
station in Troy, Ala. He attended the University of Alabama, Emory
University and the University of Georgia, combining his studies
with work at various radio stations.
   Later, he worked for radio station WXYZ in Detroit, along with
another up-and-coming broadcaster, Mike Wallace, now of ``60
Minutes.'' In addition to his Peabody, Edwards received the Lowell
Thomas Award from Marist College in 1986 and the Paul White Award
from the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1988.
   He is survived by his wife, May; three children from a previous
marriage, two stepsons, and four grandchildren.
   Funeral services will be Wednesday at the Church of the Palms in
Sarasota.

   Thousands of Iraqi children burned
effigies of President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher outside their embassies in Baghdad on Saturday, the Iraqi
News Agency said.
   The children also burned British and American flags and
delivered letters to both missions protesting ``the economic siege
imposed by the United States and its allies against the Iraqi
children.''
   The protests occurred on Iraq's National Children's Day, which
commemorates an Oct. 13, 1987 Iranian missile attack on a Baghdad
primary school that killed 39 children during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Saturday visited the school,
located in Baghdad's Dora district, according to the new agency,
monitored in Nicosia.
   The protest letters said that depriving children of food,
medicine and vaccinations under the U.N. economic embargo on Iraq
violated international human rights agreements and declarations on
the rights of children.
   The U.N. imposed the trade embargo to force Baghdad out of
Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2 and then annexed.
   ``We call upon you to retreat from this uncivilized course, and
end the blockade imposed for the purpose of subjecting Iraqi
children to hunger and endangering their health and lives,'' the
letters said.
   ``We also urge you to withdraw your forces and fleets from our
lands and Arab waters.''
   Iraqi authorities have been claiming there is a milk shortage,
but Western journalists who traveled to Baghdad recently saw stores
stocked with milk.
   In his visit to the school, Saddam met with teachers and
students ``and wished the pupils success in service of the great
objectives of Iraq,'' the news agency said.
   ``Teachers, pupils and their relatives gathered in front of
school to express pleasure over his excellency's visit,'' it said.
   In a nationally broadcast address marking Children's Day, Saddam
on Friday urged the children to understand the candy and milk
shortages caused by the trade embargo.
   ``I know that you like sweets despite the harm they cause to
your beautiful teeth, and that the younger among you live on
imported milk,'' Saddam said in the speech, read by an announcer on
government television and radio.

   As the world changes, so des the Nobel
Peace Prize.
   Once the domain of Western statesmen, recipients in recent years
have come from a range of backgrounds and regions, such as Tibet's
exiled Dalai Lama last year and Mother Teresa in 1979.
   Gidske Anderson, Norwegian Nobel Committee leader, said members
``no longer look just to the Western world, but to the whole
world.''
   ``What is new is the peace prize encouraging human rights,''
said Nobel Institute director Geir Lundestad, noting the awards
that have gone to the Dalai Lama and to Lech Walesa, leader of
Poland's Solidarity movement, among others.
   The prize could be awarded for the 71st time on Monday. Since
the first peace prize in 1901, it has been withheld 19 times, most
recently in 1972.
   The 1990 winner's name, if there is one, remains a closely
guarded secret until Ms. Anderson makes the announcement at the
Nobel Institute in Oslo.
   Ms. Anderson said she often finds speculation beforehand ``a
little amusing.''
   Norway's news media has suggested Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, South African
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela or Chinese pro-democracy
activist Chai Ling.
   Others mentioned as possible candidates include former President
Reagan, Pope John Paul II and German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.
   Nominations for 74 individuals and 26 organizations were
received by the Feb. 1 deadline.
   Ms. Anderson would not say if the 1990 award would be
surprising.
   ``But there is always someone who will criticize the choice.
It's perfectly natural. There are a lot of opinions in the world,''
she said.
   Before 1960, the only winner from outside North America or
Western Europe was Argentine negotiator Carlos de Saavedra Lamas,
who helped settle a conflict between Paraguay and Bolivia.
   But six of the past 10 winners were from other parts of the
world, including Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez in 1987,
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu in 1984, and Mexican disarmament
champion Alfonso Garcia Robles, who shared the prize in 1982.
   The Office of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded
the prize in 1981.
   The prize was founded by Alfred Nobel, a Swede who invented
dynamite and hoped the power of his find would force the world to
disarm. The prize is always awarded in Oslo on the Dec. 10
anniversary of his death in 1896.
   No one is certain why Nobel picked Norway for the peace prize.
The awards for science and literature are given in Sweden.
   Nobel's will said the peace prize should recognize those who had
arranged peace conferences, negotiated disarmament or ``encouraged
brotherhood between nations.''
   ``The committee has a great deal of latitude,'' said Lundestad.
   But three basic categories emerged quickly: humanitarians, peace
activists and world statesmen.
   The prize carries a prize of 4 million Swedish kroner, about
$700,000 at the present exchange rate.
   ``I don't think the money is that important. For someone like
Tutu or Walesa, its prestige gives them a whole new dimension. They
can no longer be ignored by their governments,'' said Anderson.
   Yet choices can provoke anger.
   China threatened sanctions against Norway after the Dalai Lama
was named. The award was seen as a slap at China for the June 4,
1989, massacre of pro-democracy students in Beijing and its 30-year
occupation of Tibet.
   Adolf Hilter was so enraged by anti-Nazi journalist Carl Von
Ossietzky winning the prize in 1935 that he decreed no German could
ever accept one. The Nobel Foundation sometimes awards a prize
retroactively, and Ossietzky received it in 1936.
   The five-member Nobel committee, appointed by Norway's
Parliament for overlapping six-year terms, does not answer to the
government.
   ``One tradition that has become stronger in the last decade is
that any kind of campaign for a candidate has the opposite
effect,'' Ms. Anderson said. ``It makes us suspicious.''
   Nor is timeliness of events, such as the 1989 pro-democracy
reforms in Eastern Europe, a key consideration.
   ``If a nomination can't last a year, then it wasn't worthy,''
Ms. Anderson said.
   ``No organization can always be on the mark, but I think the
Nobel committee has a pretty good overall record of finding worthy
winners,'' Lundestad said.

   It will be a family affair Sunday when
the 646th Quartermaster Company rolls out of town for the Middle
East.
   ``We've got a brother-sister team, a mother, father and son, a
father and son, two brothers and a couple of sets of cousins,''
said Lt. Larry Sheetz, commanding officer of the 124-member Army
Reserve unit.
   ``When we say there's a family feeling within this unit, we're
not kidding,'' Sheetz said. ``Sometimes you have to watch what you
say because someone's relative might hear.''
   The Kingwood-based unit, part of the 99th Army Reserve Command
in Oakdale, Pa., is headed for Fort Lee, Va., and several weeks of
training before deployment in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation
Desert Shield, Sheetz said.
   The 646th helps distribute fuel for front-line troops.
   ``We're like a floating gas station,'' said Sheetz. ``We can set
up a pipeline and distribution system anywhere in the world we're
told to go.''
   Staff Sgts. Walter and Rotha Hall, and Spec. 4 Jerry Hall, the
couple's son, will be among those boarding trucks and buses for the
trip to Virginia.
   Jack Gordon, a spokesman for the 99th, said the Halls are unique
among reservists nationally.
   ``I've never heard of another father, mother and son serving
together in the same unit,'' Gordon said.
   Walter Hall, 39, an assistant platoon sergeant, and Rotha Hall,
a tank farm supervisor, joined the reserve unit together 14 years
ago. Mrs. Hall wouldn't give her age.
   ``I had just gotten out of the Army and decided to join when we
tried to buy a house,'' Walter Hall said. ``We were in a pinch and
didn't have any money, so I said, `I'm going to join the reserves.'
   ``My wife said, `If you're going I'm going with you,' and here
we are,''' he said.
   As staff sergeants, the Halls each are paid $200 a month for
attending monthly meetings and a two-week training camp. Jerry
Hall, 20, receives about $150 a month.
   ``It's been great,'' Walter Hall said. ``A lot of people get
lonely when they have to leave their families to go to summer camp.
We don't have that problem.''
   ``We don't have the long distance telephone bills that some
people run up either,'' his wife added. ``It's worked out really
well. We've used our Reserve pay to buy clothes for the kids and to
buy a car.''
   Jerry Hall said good-natured ribbing from his cohorts and an
inability to conceal his cigarette habit from his parents are the
only problems he's had since joining the reserve unit three years
ago.
   ``It's really pretty cool,'' Jerry Hall said. ``They take care
of me. I kind of envy them, especially now. They have each other.
But all I'm thinking about is leaving my girlfriend behind.''
   The Halls learned they could be called up in August while the
unit was on a training mission in Okinawa shortly after Iraqi
troops invaded Kuwait.
   ``We've made out our wills and told our other children what to
do if something happens,'' Rotha Hall said. ``They told us we could
be away six months or a year. If war breaks out, they said we could
be there for the duration.''
   That possibility doesn't sit well with the Halls' two daughters
and two other sons.
   ``I hate this,'' said Lea Pyles, one of the Halls' daughters.
``I've never really been away from my parents for any length of
time. We grew up with them going to summer camp, but this is
different.
   ``We kind of figured they'd never leave the states,'' Pyles
said. ``This has been scary. One day, we're all right, the next
we're all crying. You try to be strong but it isn't easy. It's like
I'm 10 years old again.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agents Seize $3 Million From Iraqi's Account</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents seized $3 million deposited in a
bank account by an Iraqi broker who the government claims broke
federal law by shipping aircraft parts from the United States to
Libya.
   The late Ihsan Barbouti wired the $3 million to Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. in New York to finance the illegal export of the
aircraft parts, according to a federal complaint filed in New York.
   Barbouti was a London-based architect who designed a chemical
weapons plant in Rabta, Libya. He died in London in July of heart
and lung complications.
   The Dallas Morning News reported Friday that last year Barbouti
ordered parts identified in documents as replacement equipment for
CH-47 Chinook helicopters, C-130 cargo planes and French-made
Mirage jet fighters. They were shipped from Miami to Brazil, where
a Barbouti associate then shipped the equipment to Libya, according
to the complaint.
   The seizure of assets last week stems from an ongoing U.S.
Customs investigation. Federal investigators have been trying to
unravel the intricate domestic holdings of the international
middleman who described himself as a procurement broker for Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's government in Libya.
   Don de Gabrielle, a federal prosecutor in Houston, confirmed the
Oct. 4 seizure of the $3 million, but declined to say whether
Barbouti's role in the parts transactions has been presented to a
grand jury.
   The News reported last month that the arms deal was part of a
pattern of purchases and investments by Barbouti, apparently
designed to divert American technology to Libya and Iraq.
   Barbouti held interests in high-tech companies based in Houston,
Dallas, Oklahoma, and Boca Raton, Fla., the newspaper reported.
   The News also reported that interest among federal law
enforcement agencies in those investments and purchases was
heightened by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   At least three American businessman with whom Barbouti did
business told the newspaper that Barbouti intended to export
technology from their companies to Libya.
   Among Barbouti's American investments was Product Ingredient
Technology Inc., a manufacturer of cherry flavoring in Boca Raton,
Fla. Last month, the newspaper reported that a waste byproduct in
the making of cherry flavoing was hydrogen cyanide, a lethal
compound easily converted for use as a chemical weapon.
   Peter Kawaja, a high-tech security consultant and former
employee of Barbouti's, said some of the deadly compound was taken
out of the United States to a destination he declined to identify.
   As in the case of the aircraft parts, the export of such
technology would violate a 4-year-old presidential order that bars
the export of any goods, technology or services from the United
States to Libya.
   According to a Customs document, Barbouti's plan involved the
purchase of what he claimed was automobile parts from Brazil. The
Customs claim says Barbouti admitted in litigation in Florida and
New York that the $3 million really for the purchase of aircraft
parts for shipment from Brazil to Libya.

<HEAD>GAO Wants More Information About Leaky Hanford Tanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators have joined
state officials in seeking more precise data on two leaky
radioactive-waste storage tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation.
   The Energy Department said Thursday that a damaged waste tank at
Hanford may have leaked 800,000 gallons of radioactive cooling
water into the soil since being ruptured in a 1965 explosion.
   On Friday, operator Westinghouse Hanford said almost 1 million
gallons of radioactive waste and water were pumped between 1963 and
1967 into another underground tank that had leaked about 2,400
gallons of liquid in 1962.
   The two single-shell tanks are about 5 miles apart on the
560-square-mile nuclear reservation in south-central Washington.
   ``We don't have the full story yet,'' said Don Provost,
waste-management director for the state Department of Ecology.
   Provost said the state needs extra leak data so it knows how
much work is required under a 30-year federal plan for cleaning up
the entire Hanford site, which Westinghouse Hanford began operating
for the Energy Department in 1987.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, also wants to know ``what they (the operators) knew and
when they knew it,'' said Vic Rezendes, the agency's chief of
energy issues.
   The 1965 explosion caused tank 105-A to leak and the radioactive
wastes inside to overheat. The department reported a year ago that
the tank had leaked 5,000 gallons of liquid since it ruptured.
   The new estimate shows 832,000 gallons of cooling water were
pumped into the tank between 1965 and 1978, when the work stopped.
The Energy Department estimates 40,000 to 200,000 gallons may have
evaporated through vents, leaving 632,000 to 792,000 gallons still
in the soil.
   Hanford waste engineer Johnnie Newsom said officials were still
going through old records to determine how much waste was leaked.
The Energy Department has agreed to turn over any additional
records to the state.
   Energy Department spokesman Ken Morgan said there ``was an
honest attempt to provide all the information on the tanks,''
though he said the data may prove incomplete.
   The other tank, 108-SX, was pumped dry in 1980 and is no longer
in service. It cannot yet be determined how much of its contents
may have evaporated or leaked but a Westinghouse investigation
continues, said Richard Raymond, Westinghouse manager of
single-shell tanks.
   Hanford has 177 underground waste storage tanks. They were used
to store radioactive waste generated in four decades of producing
plutonium for nuclear weapons.

   Israeli officials said Saturday they regretted
the Syrian invasion of the Christian enclave in Lebanon but did not
consider it cause for an Israeli move against Syria or Lebanese
forces.
   Past reports have said Syrian use of air power in Lebanon could
lead to an Israeli attack. But Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator in
Lebanon, said the attack that forced rebel Gen. Michel Aoun to
surrender was not enough to force Israel's hand.
   ``The Syrians know very well Israel's red lines. It is true that
they used planes but ... this is the use of force in order to do
something inside Lebanon,'' Lubrani said on Israel television.
   ``We are sticking to the position that anything that doesn't
threaten our security ... doesn't obligate us to make any move that
would be seen as interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.''
   He added: ``We are sorry that it came to the use of violence and
the entrance of Syrian forces into the Christian enclave. We hope
that these forces will leave as quickly as possible.''
   Israel carved out a 2- to 10-mile wide strip in southern Lebanon
in 1985 to act as a buffer against guerrilla attacks when it
withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon following its 1982
invasion.
   A 3,000-man South Lebanon Army led by General Antoine Lahad
patrols the zone, backed by about 1,000 Israeli troops.
   Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a parliamentary leader, said Aoun's
surrender would have little affect on the security of Israel's
northern border, despite the Christian South Lebanon Army's close
relations with Aoun.
   ``Don't forget that Lahad is supported, that his back leans
totally on Israel,'' Ben-Eliezer said.
   Israel radio said residents of southern Lebanon had turned to
the Israeli army officers to protect Christians in Beirut from
reprisals in the wake of Aoun's defeat.
   Israeli military sources said such appeals could not be granted.

   Customers looking at a television monitor
in a check-cashing store saw a gunman sneaking around and thought
they were witnessing a crime.
   But it was daytime drama of a different sort.
   The women dashed down the street to call police, who quickly
swarmed the store. The women didn't realize the monitor was just a
TV set tuned to the soap opera ``General Hospital,'' and the man
with gun was an actor.
   As police positioned themselves outside the Check-X-Change on
Wednesday, a dispatcher called the store's teller, 20-year-old
Chris Wiltse.
   ``They asked if everything was OK and I said, `Yes,''' Wiltse
said. ``And they said, `Are you sure?'''
   The police dispatcher asked Wiltse to come outside to talk to
the officers.
   ``There were police everywhere,'' Wiltse said. ``I was like
`Wow.' They searched the building real quick to make sure nobody
was there.''
   In the convincing make-believe, actor Scott Thompson Baker,
playing Colton on the soap opera, was creeping gun-in-hand toward
the hospital roof to rescue some hostages. He eventually freed
them, of course.
   Baker, in an interview from Los Angeles, said he was flattered
that his performance was so effecting.
   Police Lt. Robert VanLeuven said the women, whose names weren't
released, did the right thing.
   ``We would rather receive a call of that nature and have people
be involved than have someone ignore it,'' he said.

   An actor using a loaded gun in a film being
made by college students in a cemetery accidentally shot another
member of the cast, police said.
   The victim, a 28-year-old actress, was shot in the chest with a
large-caliber handgun at Valhalla Memorial Park late Friday
afternoon, Burbank police Lt. Gordon Bowers said Saturday.
   She was flown by helicopter to a hospital and was listed in
stable condition, Bowers said. Her name was not released.
   The woman was shot on camera, Sgt. Ed Skarvana said.
   ``Incredible as it may seem ... they used a loaded gun,'' he
said. ``They didn't know it was loaded or they had forgotten.''
   The actor was questioned, but the shooting appeared to be
accidental and there were no arrests, Bowers said.
   Valhalla Memorial Park is in the city's North Hollywood section
on the edge of Burbank.

   At least 19 Westerners were told they
could leave Iraq after appeals by a Spanish lawmaker and by Youssef
Islam, the former pop singer known as Cat Stevens.
   The 15 Spaniards and four Britons were to leave Sunday on
regular Iraqi Airlines flights to Amman, according to Spanish
Parliament member Cristina Almeida and Youssef Islam, the name the
singer adopted after converting to the Moslem faith.
   Ms. Almeida and Youssef Islam said they had met with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to urge the foreigners be released.
   On Saturday, the Baghdad station manager of the Dutch carrier
KLM was allowed to depart Iraq, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said in
Amsterdam. The employee, Jan van Houten, arrived in Amman on
Saturday.
   Dutch Television reported Saturday that all Western airline
employees would be allowed to leave Iraq and occupied Kuwait, but
gave no further details or source for the information.
   Youssef Islam said he has been in Iraq for about a month
atttempting to obtain freedom for foreigners. The four Britons
scheduled for release are Moslems who were making pilgrimages to
Islamic shrines in Iraq when they were stranded by the Aug. 2
invasion and Saddam's order detaining all Westerners.
   British diplomats in Baghdad speculated that more Britons might
be permitted to leave after former British Prime Minister Edward
Heath's scheduled meeting with Saddam on Oct. 21.
   Ms. Almeida, a noted human rights activist in Spain, arrived in
Iraq on Oct. 4 to appeal for the release of her countrymen. The 15
are reportedly the only non-diplomat Spaniards left in Iraq.
   Thousands of Westerners are being detained by Iraq or are in
hiding in occupied Kuwait.
   An estimated 700 U.S., British, French and German citizens and
other Westerners are being held as human shields around strategic
targets to deter attack by U.S.-led forces in Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf region.

   When the natural springs that had fed this
West Texas region for millennia dried up in the 1930s, Lake Lubbock
vanished with them.
   But the lake has not been forgotten. Its legacy was in helping
to preserve a treasure store of artifacts of human and animal life
dating back more than 11,000 years, archaeologists say.
   The arid, windswept plains of West Texas were once rich with
grasslands inhabited by huge hairy mammoths, 3-foot-tall armadillos
and bears three times the size of a grizzly. Lake Lubbock has
provided the proof.
   A 300-acre site northwest of Lubbock, centered on where the lake
once existed, has been turned into a state park that has been
designated as a federal historic site. The Lake Lubbock Landmark
opens Sunday.
   Some archaeologists regard it as the premier site of its kind in
North America. Over the last 50 years, researchers have unearthed
evidence that the area has been continuously inhabited for more
than 11,000 years.
   ``The site basically is little packages of time, stacked one on
top of the other,'' said Eileen Johnson, the park's director. ``You
can study man's entire existence in the New World in one spot
instead of having to go to 100 different sites.''
   Researchers have been able to identify soils, vegetation, pollen
records, wildlife and human culture from fossils excavated at the
site.
   Among the bigger finds have been an ancient short-faced bear, a
giant armadillo and mammoths.
   ``The giant armadillo was truly Texas-size,'' Ms. Johnson said.
``It was 3-feet-tall and 6-feet-long.''
   Researchers have also identified the remains of prehistoric
plants, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds, she said.
   While researchers have found evidence of human life - projectile
points, bone tools, manufacturing debris, processing areas,
slaughter sites and an oven - ``the most fantastic thing is that no
human remains have ever been found,'' said Robert A. Nash, a
longtime supporter and namesake of the landmark's interpretive
center.
   ``That would be the find of the century if they found a skull of
the so-called Clovis or Folsom man,'' he said.
   Amid the sprawling acres are a museum documenting the site and a
research lab occupied by archaeological students from Texas Tech
University.
   After visitors pass through the museum, filled with murals of
ancient life, photographs and fossils, they are encouraged to walk
through the excavation sites. Picnic tables and grills are set up
for barbecues.
   The park is a collaborative effort by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, Texas Tech and the city of Lubbock. The state
agency leases the property from the city and Texas Tech provides
the research.
   ``We know only 5 percent of what is out there,'' Ms. Johnson
said. ``It's awe-inspiring and exciting to think we will be
uncovering and learning here for years and years to come.''
   Scholars from around the world were expected to attend the
park's formal opening.
   John Albanese, a Wyoming-based geologist and independent
consultant for archaeological sites, said the park ``is the premier
site in terms of the quality and quantity of the old material that
has been found there.''
   ``It's one of the better preserved records of early man in North
America,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former Gulf War Foes Reported To Open Embassies in Tehran and
Baghdad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq were to open embassies in
each other's capitals Sunday, marking another step in the
rapprochement of the two nations after a decade of hostility, the
Tehran Times reported.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is seeking Iranian help in
puncturing the comprehensive economic embargo slapped on him by the
United Nations to force his pullback from Kuwait.
   Quoting an informed source, the English-language newspaper's
Sunday edition said the two nations agreed to establish missions
during the current Tehran visit by Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister
Wisam al-Zahawi.
   The source said the level of representation would be at the
charge d'affaires level for the time being.
   Iranian political circles believe Tehran's first envoy will be
Javad Turkabadi, Iran's former charge d'affaires in Kuwait.
Turkabadi currently heads the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Persian
Gulf Affairs desk.
   There was no word on who the first Iraqi envoy would be.
   Iran and Iraq agreed to re-establish diplomatic ties during a
September visit to Tehran by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   It was the first visit by an Iraqi official since before the
1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
   A year later, war broke out between the two nations. A
U.N.-brokered peace was made in 1988.
   Iraq has been seeking the help of neighboring states to
circumvent the U.N. sanctions, since its coastline is effectively
blocked by the U.S.-led multinational fleet in the Gulf.
   Iraq and Iran share a 700-mile border, and although Tehran has
condemned Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, there have been reports Iran
was allowing food shipments across the border.
   Iran could be of even greater help if it helps Iraq ship its
oil, which accounted for more than 95 percent of Iraqi foreign
exchange earnings before the embargo.
   The embargo and blockade have shut down Iraqi exports, but Iran
could use the pipeline to its Kharg Island terminal in the gulf to
carry Iraqi oil from across the nearby border.

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greenpeace ship seized by the Soviets
after it approached an Arctic nuclear test site was released
Saturday and headed for Norway, a member of the environmental group
said.
   None of the 42 activists detained were charged following more
than five days at a naval base near the port of Murmansk, about 900
miles north of Moscow, Canadian activist Steve Shallhorn said by
radiotelephone from the ship.
   The ship was expected to reach the Norwegian port of Kirkenes by
early Sunday.
   Last Monday, the Soviet Coast Guard fired warning shots from
deck-mounted machine guns before boarding the MV Greenpeace.
   Four environmentalists in a rubber raft had earlier managed to
reach one of the Novaya Zemlya islands in the Barents Sea and
collect radioactive soil and other samples, Shallhorn said.
   The ship was towed to the naval base, where it was held for
violating Soviet territorial waters.
   Shallhorn said the four activists spent 10 hours on the island
before being captured. Novaya Zemlya was a primary nuclear test
site from 1958 to 1963. Environmental groups claim it was last used
in 1988.
   ``They tried to hide samples in their packs, their pockets, even
their socks, but the (Soviets) went through everything with a
Geiger counter and found everything,'' Shallhorn said.
   He said the 35 Western and seven Soviet activists had been
generally treated well during the detention, and were guarded by at
least 13 armed men under KGB command.
   The Greenpeace was ordered to leave Soviet territorial waters
following an investigation by the KGB security police and the
Soviet Prosecutor's Office, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The vessel was on a two-week anti-nuclear protest voyage along
the Arctic coastline.
   On Wednesday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said the Soviet Union agreed with the Greenpeace goal of
ending nuclear weapons testing. But, he said, ``no matter what the
mission or how noble the objectives may be, the laws of our country
cannot be violated with impunity.''
   According to Greenpeace officials in London, Novaya Zemlya was
chosen for the protest because of fears it would again become a
major test site after the closing down of the Soviet Union's main
test range in the Kazakhstan republic in central Asia.
   The site is about 370 miles from Norway. Unconfirmed reports
that nuclear tests would be resumed there prompted protests from
Nordic governments.

<HEAD>New Orleans' Oldest Abortion Clinic Shuts Down After Feds Seize
Equipment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city's best-known abortion clinic has
closed after authorities seized its equipment for failing to pay
federal fines. The penalties were ordered because clinic doctors
illegally prescribed drugs.
   The clinic's lawyer contends the seizure was more than a matter
of $337,000 in fines, but a stroke against abortion.
   ``I've talked to people all over the country, and this is the
only time this has ever happened,'' said Charles Cotton, an
attorney for Delta Women's Clinic, after its equipment and
furniture were seized Friday.
   The U.S. Marshals Service said it will auction the confiscated
items to collect on fines set in March by U.S. District Judge
Adrian Duplantier.
   The judge agreed with federal prosecutors that three doctors
illegally prescribed sedatives and painkillers at the clinic. The
physicians were licensed to prescribe the drugs, but had not
registered to do so at the clinic.
   Clinical Leasing Services Inc., which owns the clinic, filed for
protection from its creditors in May. But Thursday federal
Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Kingsmill dismissed the petition, saying it
was filed in bad faith.
   Cotton said he hadn't been told of the ruling when the clinic's
assets were seized.
   ``The speed, rapidity and zeal in which this was handled leads
us to believe it was more than a simple execution of a judgment,''
Cotton said.
   ``This is an attempt to circumvent Roe vs. Wade and an attempt
to abrogate women's right to choose'' an abortion, Cotton said. The
clinic opened in 1973 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
legalized abortion.
   First Assistant U.S. Attorney Al Winters Jr. said the government
simply went after a debt it was owed. ``We are collecting the civil
judgment as required by law,'' Winters said.
   U.S. Attorney John Volz has denied repeatedly that his office
sued Delta in July 1989 to shut it down.
   Cotton said the clinic may stay closed until the courts can hear
an appeal.
   Clinical Leasing Services said in the spring that it wanted to
appeal the court ruling but could not afford the fine or an appeal
bond.
   The bond would have kept the case in court and prevented the
seizure of assets.
   In April the government seized about $40,000 from clinic
accounts, Cotton said.
   Volz has said that federal authorities began looking into the
clinic's operations in August 1988, and had warned officials that
physicians had to be registered to dispense drugs at the clinic.
   Duplantier ordered fines of $300,000 against the clinic for 100
instances in which doctors prescribed sedatives and painkillers.
   The judge also fined the clinic $37,000 for 37 instances of
alleged failure to list addresses of patients who had received
drugs.
   Duplantier also fined the doctors a total of $278,000. They are
appealing the fines.

   A Russian Orthodox service reverberated across Red
Square from the brightly colored, onion-shaped domes of St. Basil's
Cathedral on Saturday night for the first time since the 1917
Revolution.
   In one of the most stirring demonstrations of the revival of
religion in the Soviet Union, the plaintive chanting of the
faithful echoed off the Kremlin's red brick walls, floated over
Lenin's marble tomb and through much of central Moscow on a cold,
clear night.
   St. Basil's, whose bright yellow, green, blue and white domes
and spires are among Russia's most famous symbols, sits on the
southern edge of the cobblestone square. The plaza is bordered on
the east by the immense GUM department store and on the west by the
Kremlin, seat of the Soviet government.
   Like many important churches across the country, St. Basil's was
confiscated by the Soviet government after the Bolshevik
Revolution, converted into a museum and closed to religious
observances.
   Saturday's service - commemorating a ninth century miracle in
which the Mother of God is said to have appeared to soldiers
defending the city of Byzantium - was the first allowed in the
cathedral since 1917.
   Official tolerance for religion has increased greatly since
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985. During the
last two years, in particular, many churches have been
reconsecrated, and Soviet citizens have flocked to services in
record numbers.
   Last month, a full service was held in the Kremlin's Uspensky
Cathedral, the country's holiest church, for the first time since
the revolution. The Soviet legislature also passed a law on freedom
of conscience, formally ending decades of repression.
   Shortly before nightfall Saturday, hundreds of people packed St.
Basil's, built in 1555-1561 by Ivan the Terrible to celebrate his
military victory over the kingdom of Kazan on Russia's eastern
border.
   As many as 1,000 other worshippers gathered behind police
barricades outside the church, enduring 35-degree temperatures
throughout the three-hour service, which was projected by two sound
trucks on the square.
   The worshippers stood silently, gazing up at the domes
illuminated by floodlights and periodically making the four-point
sign of the cross across their chests with three fingers, in the
eastern church tradition.
   Inside, the scent of incense filled the cathedral and the
choir's chanting seemed at times to come from within the walls of
its eight chapels, which represent Ivan's eight major battles
against Kazan.
   Among the worshippers Saturday was a former KGB general, Oleg
Kalugin, who was stripped of his rank, honors and pension last
summer after he accused the security police of continuing to spy on
ordinary citizens, including clergymen. The service was conducted
by Archimandrite Pavel of Pskov, one of the leaders of the Russian
Orthodox Church, which has an estimated 30 million active followers
among the Soviet Union's 285 million people.
   ``I am a believer, and for us, this is a great event in our
life,'' said Vitaly Kolesnik, 55, a magazine editor. ``I wanted to
be here, on Red Square, when it happened.''
   ``It was very sad when this was a museum. Now, there is joy and
the walls are alive again with prayer,'' said Maya Besarabskaya,
60, a Moscow sculptor who held a thin candle in her strong hands.

<TEXT>
   Racists and civil rights advocates are
sitting side by side in a courtroom to watch white supremacist Tom
Metzger battle a crusading Alabama attorney out to bankrupt him and
his cause.
   Metzger, 52, a television repairman from Fallbrook, Calif., is a
former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon and founder of the White Aryan
Resistance. The Aryan Youth Movement, a WAR spinoff, is headed by
his son John, 22.
   The groups believe in racial separatism. The extent of their
ambitions is at the heart of the trial that on Monday enters its
second week at the Multnomah County Courthouse.
   The Metzgers are accused of inciting the beating death of a
black man by sending agents to Portland to preach hate and
violence.
   Mulugeta Seraw, 27, an Ethiopian national planning to attend
college in this country, was returning home from a party in
November 1988 when he was beaten to death with a bat.
   Three ``skinheads'' have pleaded guilty to killing Seraw.
   Now Seraw's family wants $10 million in damages for his death.
The lead attorney in the civil suit is Morris Dees, a civil rights
lawyer from the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
   Three years ago, Dees won a $7 million jury verdict that put the
United Klans of America out of business. Two Klansmen from Mobile,
Ala., killed a black man. As compensation, the victim's mother
received title to the Klan's national headquarters.
   The Metzgers are representing themselves in the trial before
Judge Ancer Haggerty.
   ``I am a white separatist,'' the elder Metzger told jurors, by
way of introduction.
   ``I'm a small-business man from Fallbrook, Calif. I'm going to
talk to you like I would one of my customers over a cup of coffee
or a beer.''
   He told jurors the lawsuit was a government attempt to persecute
him.
   Dees spent the week trying to link the Metzgers to Seraw's
murder, in part through the testimony of Kenneth Mieske.
   Mieske, who goes by the nicknames Ken Death and Bat Man, is
serving a life sentence for killing Seraw. Under Dees' questioning
he was contentious, often smirking and winking at his girlfriend
across the courtroom.
   When he pleaded guilty to killing Seraw, Mieske had said his
motive was racial.
   But on the stand last week Mieske said the government forced him
to say that. The alternative, he said, would have been charges
bringing more prison time than the 20-year minimum sentence he
ultimately received.
   Mieske, 25, said he really killed Seraw to defend fellow
skinhead Kyle Brewster. Seraw hit Brewster with a ``sucker punch,''
he said, and Seraw was choking him.
   A man allegedly sent to train Mieske in violence, Dave Mazzella,
21, is Dees' star witness and he put him on the stand Friday.
   Mazella, a former vice president of the Aryan Youth Movement,
told jurors the Metzgers sent him to Portland to organize neo-Nazi
skinheads and incite them to do violence against minorities.
   At the Metzgers' direction, Mazella said, he headed for Kenneth
Mieske's home after arriving in Portland.
   Metzger has filed a countersuit against Mazella and two other
men he allegedly sent to Portland, charging they were ``agent
provocateurs'' working for the Portland police. The countersuit
also claims two of Seraw's friends provoked the fight with the
skinheads and that they and the ``provocateurs'' should be liable
for any damages Metzger might be ordered to pay Seraw's estate.
   Among the spectators are skinheads professing racism and members
of Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice. The American Civil Liberties
Union and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith are monitoring
the trial as well.
   The courthouse is under heavy security. Police taped paper over
the courtroom windows and spectators were required to pass through
a labyrinth of metal detectors.
   Officers routinely lined skinheads along the wall outside the
courtroom and searched them. Three skinheads were arrested for
carrying weapons, and two on outstanding warrants. One warrant
alleged a neo-Nazi skinhead had tried to carve a swastika into the
skull of a member of Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice.
   Police revealed some anxiety early in the week when they spotted
a suspicious-looking lunchbox outside a federal courthouse several
blocks from where the trial is being held.
   The bomb squad was called and the box was gingerly pulled by a
rope into the street. It contained a lunch.

<TEXT>
   A geyser-like blast of boiling
water and hot rocks leveled homes and killed at least 13 people in
a western Salvadoran village Saturday.
   The 3 a.m. eruption left a huge crater and shot water, mud and
stones up to 350 feet around this small farm community 60 miles
west of San Salvador, the capital. At least seven homes were
destroyed and 20 others hospitalized.
   ``First it felt like an earthquake, followed by a strong wind,''
said Miguel Antonio Melgar, 56. ``I ran outside. There was a lot of
smoke and rocks.''
   ``Rocks and boiling water were falling all over the place,''
said Army Maj. Jose Rodriguez, from the nearby military base at
Ahuachapan.
   El Salvador sits on a geological fault and is frequently shaken
by earthquakes and volcanic activity. The Massachusetts-sized
nation with a population of 5 million is dotted with thermal wells,
some harnessed to generate electricity.
   Rodriguez said the site that exploded was not being used for
power, but often attracted tourists to El Barro, Spanish for ``the
mud.'' Sometimes the murky well pffed steam.
   The village has hardly been touched by the guerrilla war
concentrated in the eastern half of the country during the past
decade. The war has left more than 73,000 people dead.
   ``Here we are far from the war, but suddenly we are suffering,''
Antonio Melgar said as he dug with a spade through the rubble of
his brother's home, crushed by falling rocks. His brother,
sister-in-law and the couple's four children were killed.
   Candida Hernandez, 53, who lives 90 feet from the geothermal
well, said she will likely remain in the village.
   ``We have long heard that it could be dangerous, but what should
we do? We're poor people and we have nowhere else to live. We're
going to stay here,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Since his election 11 months ago, Elias
Hrawi has been known as the displaced president because rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun held the presidential palace and refused to recognize
him.
   After Aoun was pushed out by Syrian and Lebanese government
forces Saturday, Hrawi, an affable 65-year-old former agricultural
engineer, can at last claim it for his own.
   Not that there's much left to claim. The hilltop palace in
Baabda east of Beirut is a ruin, hit by hundreds of shells fired by
the Syrians and their allies last year in their war against Aoun.
   The shell-shattered mansion symbolizes the awesome task that
Hrawi, a wealthy Christian landowner, faces in implementing a 1989
peace accord to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war. Then he must
rebuild the shattered country.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, is a native of the town of
Zahle in the fertile Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where his
family has an agricultural business.
   He was elected president Nov. 24 by Parliament, which convened
at a honeymoon hotel in the Syrian-policed Bekaa because Aoun had
banned elections in the 300-square-mile Christian enclave north of
Beirut.
   Hrawi's main task was to implement the peace agreement reached
in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October 1989.
   Unable to occupy what was left of the palace in the Christian
enclave, Hrawi had to make his headquarters in a spartan Lebanese
army barracks in the Bekaa. He later moved to an apartment in west
Beirut near the Syrian army command.
   Security around him has been tight. He rarely moves outside his
heavily guarded building and his travel plans are kept secret.

<HEAD>Threats From Lili Diminish, But Rain Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat from Tropical Storm Lili diminished Saturday, but
rain continued over much of the nation.
   Lili was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm early
Saturday and maximum sustained winds of 60 mph were forecast to
diminish by Sunday. Lili was moving north over the Atlantic
northeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., Saturday evening.
   There was flooding in the South and along the Atlantic Coast,
with many roads closed and widespread damage.
   The National Weather Service said a major flood worked its way
down the Ogeechee River in east-central Georgia Saturday. Flood
stage at Midville is six feet, and the river there was at 12 feet
Saturday morning, the weather service said.
   There also was rain in Pennsylvania, northern Vermont and
portions of New York state, New Jersey and much of New England.
   Snow fell in the mountains of Wyoming Saturday morning, with a
mixture of rain and snow falling over the north-central portion of
the state in the afternoon.
   Rain was scattered over western Montana and the Idaho panhandle
as well as across northwest Nebraska.
   High winds were reported in Wyoming, Idaho and in the mountains
of Colorado.
   Winds gusted to 57 mph near Pocatello, Idaho, and to 58 mph at
Laramie, Wyo.
   Cape Hatteras reached 84 degrees Saturday, breaking its high
temperature record for the date. The high temperature record has
been tied or broken there every day for the past week.
   Miami warmed to 91 degrees, also a record for the date.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 91 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Low temperature for the Lower 48 Saturday morning was 16 degrees
at Gunnison, Colo.

   As a hurricane watch sent caravans of
prudent campers scurrying inland, another type of human headed in
the opposite direction: the windsurfer.
   Ted Mustric and Mike Sweazen of Beaver Falls, Pa., jumped in
their car and drove through the night to North Carolina as soon as
they heard Wednesday about Hurricane Lili, and the prospect of
speeding winds.
   ``We heard about the hurricane and all the turbulence,'' Mustric
said. ``I knew it would be windy, so I said `Let's go!'''
   ``Actually we like gale-force winds,'' Mustric said, sounding a
bit disappointed that Lili had been downgraded from a hurricane to
a tropical storm early Saturday.
   Though tropical storm watches and warnings were canceled along
the mid-Atlantic coast, strong winds combined with glass-smooth
waters produced ideal conditions for windsurfers who flocked to
Pamlico Sound, which lies between North Carolina's Outer Banks and
the mainland.
   On Friday afternoon, campgrounds on Hatteras Island were
deserted and radio announcers were imploring residents to board up
their windows. But at one of the most popular wind-surfing spots on
the East Coast, it was business as usual: sun, stiff wind and no
waves.
   ``It's an absolutely fabulous day,'' said Gill Barlow of
Charlotte, Vt.
   Behind him, across a parking lot packed with scores of vans,
station wagons and pickup trucks all from points north, raged an
Atlantic churned by the approaching storm.
   ``We're not disrespectful of the possibility of a hurricane,''
Barlow said. ``We have time to get out. The house is buttoned down
and we're packed.''
   But he, and others like him who had come south from as far away
as Montreal, were not going anywhere until they were forced out.
   ``I would only leave if they told us to leave,'' said Gus
Linssen, a Bostonian who brings windsurfing students to this
parking lot on a sliver of private land wedged inside the Cape
Hatteras National Seashore near Avon.
   Every other vehicle at Canadian Hole had at least one neon
surfboard on top or in back. One bumper sticker read ``Pray For
Wind.''
   The lot was busy with windsurfers either coming out of the water
or getting ready to go in.
   ``It's a great spot because it's shallow,'' said Steve Pomeroy
of Boston, one of Linssen's charges. ``You can walk out as far as
you want and the water will only come up to your waist.''

<TEXT>
   A four-day auction of Exxon's surplus
oil-spill cleanup gear grossed well over the expected $10 million,
auction company officials said.
   The Vancouver, British Columbia-based Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers
International wouldn't say Saturday exactly how much it took in.
   The sale, which drew thousands of bidders to several lots around
Anchorage, concluded Friday. Everything sold, from a float plane to
mobile homes to Zodiac boats to fishing nets to household
appliances, officials said.
   Ritchie Bros. bought the merchandise last month from Exxon Corp.
for an undisclosed price.
   The gear was left over from Exxon's 1989 and 1990 summer cleanup
efforts on Alaska shorelines tainted by the Exxon Valdez's spill in
March 1989 of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. It was the
nation's biggest oil spill.

   Six West Virginia teachers lured to a
state school board meeting on the pretext of setting up an
educational task force were instead named winners of $25,000 awards
for excellence.
   Susan Burt, a social studies teacher at Marlinton Middle School,
said she didn't want to attend the board meeting Friday until she
was told she was needed for a task force, which turned out be
fictitious.
   ``I'm certainly pleased I changed my mind,'' she said.
   The money was provided by the Los Angeles-based Milken Family
Foundation in recognition of the educators' exemplary leadership
skills, professional achievements and ability to motivate students.
   West Virginia is one of 13 states chosen by the three-year-old
foundation to participate in a program designed to get public
recognition and financial awards for outstanding teachers and
principals, State Schools Superintendent Hank Marockie said.
   He said top school officials chose the six from more than 200
candidates.

   Hundreds of Kuwaitis crossed into Saudi Arabia after Iraq
suddenly relaxed restrictions on Kuwaitis leaving the occupied
emirate. Some refugees said it was the latest move in an Iraqi
campaign to depopulate Kuwait, isolate the resistance movement and
prepare for war.

Air National Guard assigned to Operation Desert Shield.
   Two U.S. Marine helicopters with eight men aboard were reported
missing in the Gulf of Oman. Naval officers ruled out hostile
action.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Leads Reporters on Tour of Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The justice minister led reporters on a
tour of the Central Prison on Saturday, where captives taken since
a rebel invasion last month complained of harsh conditions and lack
of medical care.
   Among them were two young Ugandan boys, who showed gruesome
marks on their backs they said came from being jabbed with
bayonets.
   ``The wounds are three or four days old and haven't been looked
after yet,'' said the guide who escorted the delegation of
reporters and Western diplomats through the prison.
   Rwandan Justice Minister Pheomesee Mutgamama said at least 2,500
people have been arrested for allegedly collaborating with the
rebels who invaded from Uganda. About 1,000 of them have been
released, he said.
   Some of the detainees complained of squalid conditions and
brutality.
   ```If they keep me here much longer my baby will die,'' said a
Ugandan woman who was nursing her infant. ``My baby is still breast
feeding but because of the bad food in this prison I'm scared I
cannot give milk anymore to my baby.''
   A man with a swollen mouth said he was beaten with the butt of a
gun.
   ``We were put in a truck,'' he said. ``A young boy tried to
escape and he was killed, shot on the spot.''
   The government gave permission Saturday for the International
Red Cross to visit the prison.
   Foreign governments, including the United States, have been
stressing to Rwanda's government that it should respect human
rights and work to avoid the outbreak of an all-out tribal war in
Rwanda.
   Maj.-Gen. Juneval Habyarimana, a member of the majority Hutu
tribe who has ruled Rwanda for 17 years, has been seeking western
military aid for his government. He claims its troops are
outnumbered by the invasion force.
   In the early 1960s, the Hutu crushed a Tutsi uprising, killing
more than 10,000 members of the tribe, whose members make up about
15 percent of Rwanda's population of 8 million.
   The rebel force that invaded from Uganda includes Tutsi refugees
from among the hundreds of thousands who were forced to flee in the
1960s.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Prince Promises Greater Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The crown prince of Kuwait Saturday promised greater democracy
for the oil-rich emirate if it is freed from Iraqi occupation. In
Jordan, Iraq's foreign minister hinted at a possible
``reconsideration'' of Baghdad's hard-line position on Kuwait.
   But reports that Iran and Iraq plan to upgrade diplomatic
relations could help Iraq's quest to circumvent the U.N.-sanctioned
boycott.
   ``Liberation is our top priority, and after liberation we have
much to achieve,'' Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah told a gathering
of about 1,000 Kuwaiti exiles in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, for a
three-day conference.
   After liberation, he said, ``Kuwait will reinforce democracy and
consolidate popular participation. The political leadership will
respond to the aspirations of the people regarding the
reorganization of the Kuwaiti house.'' Sheik Saad is also the
nation's prime minister.
   Outside the hall, hundreds of youths raised banners of support
for the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who opened the
conference. The meeting was being attended by some who, before the
Aug. 2 invasion, demanded a return to the Western-style democracy
prescribed in the 1962 constitution.
   In the Jordanian capital of Amman, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz said Saturday the gulf crisis has entered a new phase of
``reconsideration.''
   ``The present phase is one of reconsideration and reassessment
of all plans and trends,'' said Aziz, holding talks with King
Hussein and other Jordanian officials. ``But we must have no
illusions regarding the agggressive intentions of the United
States, the Zionist entity, and other Western powers.''
   ``We in Iraq are still looking for a comprehensive and just
peace that safeguards the rights (of Arabs) and eliminates the core
of the Middle East crises,'' said Aziz, alluding to the Palestinian
uprising against Israel. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
previously linked a gulf settlement to Israeli withdrawal from
lands claimed by the Palestinians.
   The Tehran Times reported that Iran and Iraq were to open
embassies in each other's capitals Sunday following more than a
decade of hostility.
   Saddam is seeking Iranian help to puncture the U.N.-sponsored
embargo, possibly using Iranian pipelines to ship Iraqi oil.
   Quoting an unidentified source, the English-language newspaper
said the two nations agreed to establish missions during a visit to
Tehran by Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Wisam al-Zahawi.
   In Baghdad, children burned British and American flags and
delivered letters to both embassies saying the U.N.-sanctioned
economic sanctions are ``subjecting Iraqi children to hunger and
endangering their health and lives.'' The protests occurred on
Iraq's National Children's Day, which commemorates an Oct. 13, 1987
Iranian missile attack on a Baghdad primary school that killed 39
children.
   In other developments:
   -Fifteen Spaniards and four Britons were expected to leave
Sunday on regular Iraqi Airlines flights to the Jordanian capital
of Amman, according to Spanish Parliament member Cristina Almeida
and Youssef Islam, the name the former pop singer Cat Stevens
adopted after converting to the Moslem faith.
   The two said they arranged the releases in talks with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   -A Sudanese cargo ship sunk after colliding with an Iraqi vessel
near Port Sudan. Three of its crew were reported missing, the
official Sudan News Agency said Saturday.
   It said the collision between Sheeba and the Iraq cargo vessel
Altaawin Alarabi took place Thursday, three nautical miles
northeast of Port Sudan. The Iraqi ship had refrigeration on board.
   There was no explanation for the presence of the ship off Sudan,
which insists it is honoring the conomic boycott on Iraq.
   -Turkish President Turgut Ozal on Saturday began a visit to five
Middle Eastern and Gulf countries, with Saudi Arabia as his first
stop. Turkey made a major contribution to the U.N. embargo by
shutting off twin pipelines carrying Iraqi crude through Turkey.
   -Were a one-megaton nuclear bomb dropped on Baghdad, it would
immediately kill 2.3 million people and injure nearly 1.3 million
others, according to the International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War, Inc. The group, which won the 1985 Nobel
Peace Prize, was meeting in Prato, Italy, to discuss the gulf
crisis.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Forbids Destruction of Monuments to Lenin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued a decree
Saturday forbidding the removal or destruction of Lenin monuments,
war memorials and other state symbols under attack by
anti-Communist protesters.
   Crowds in several cities have toppled statues of Vladimir I.
Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution, and desecrated other
symbols of Communist power.
   Gorbachev's decree says such actions ``are incompatible with
popular traditions, respect for the history of the Motherland and
generally recognized moral standards.''
   In the most recent incident, unidentified protesters attempted
Oct. 4 to blow up a monument to Soviet soldiers who died fighting
the Nazis in 1944 near the Lithuanian town of Krizhkalnis.
   Lithuanian leaders contend that their republic was illegally
occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union at the end of World War
II, and there is widespread resentment against the Red army among
Lithuanian citizens.
   The republic's government, in a statement Saturday, deplored the
bombing, which it called a ``provocative act ... perpetrated by
forces aiming to destabilize the situation in Lithuania'' prior to
negotiations on independence.
   Under Gorbachev's reforms, plaques and monuments to disgraced
Soviet leaders such as Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev have been
removed. But Lenin, who led the revolution until his illness and
death in 1924, is another matter.
   Some criticism of Lenin has appeared in the state-run press. But
moves to brand him as a criminal and to stop venerating the Soviet
victory in ``the Great Patriotic War'' of 1939-1945 appear to have
met stiff public resistance, particularly in Russia, the largest
Soviet republic.
   Outraged citizens have written letters to newspapers and been
interviewed on television. When the city council in the Ukrainian
city of Ternopol voted in July to dismantle statues of Lenin and
Karl Marx, the local Communist Party committee branded it an act of
``vandalism and barbarism.''
   According to the newspaper Soviet Culture, statues of Lenin have
been destroyed in more than two dozen Georgian towns, and attempts
have been made to topple them in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku
and the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
   A giant monument to Lenin in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi was
guarded round-the-clock for months until authorities gave into
public demands and allowed it to be dismantled in September.
   Some prominent politicians, including the radical mayor of
Moscow, Gavriil Popov, have advocated pulling down memorials to
Lenin and changing the names of cities, streets and institutions
dedicated to him.
   The city council of Leninakan, an Armenian community that was
virtually destroyed by an earthquake two years ago and has since
been rebuilt with international aid, voted this week to retake its
ancient name of Kumairi.
   There has also been popular pressure in Leningrad to change back
to the pre-revolutionary name of St. Petersburg.
   Gorbachev's decree apparently does not prevent name changes. But
it suspends all decisions by local authorities ``about the pulling
down, moving or changing of memorial structures,'' according to the
official Soviet news agency Tass.

<TEXT>
   Public approval of President Bush's handling of
the economy and his handling of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
dropped in recent weeks, according to a CBS News-New York Times
poll released Saturday.
   Bush's 60 percent overall approval rating in the poll is the
worst of his presidency, but still higher than that recorded for
Presidents Reagan and Carter at the same point in their
administrations.
   The poll found a majority of Americans still approves of Bush's
actions in the Persian Gulf, but the 57 percent approval rating is
down from 75 percent soon after the invasion. The poll found 34
percent disapproved of Bush's handling of Iraq.
   Asked to rate Bush's handling of the economy, 52 percent said
they disapproved and 36 percent said they approved.
   In August, 45 percent approved of Bush's handling of the
economy, and 44 percent disapproved.
   Amid heightened concern over Bush's handling of the economy and
the budget deficit, 30 percent said they disapproved of his overall
performance - the highest level of his presidency in the CBS-New
York Times poll.
   The poll was conducted among a random sample of 960 adults
around the United States interviewed by telephone Monday through
Wednesday. Results of such a poll should generally be accurate to
within 3 percentage points in either direction.

<HEAD>Opponents Unveil Manifesto With Some of Bhutto's Promises</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The loose-knit coalition opposed to
ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Saturday opened their
campaign by announcing a platform that includes some of Ms.
Bhutto's populist ideas.
   The Islamic Democratic Alliance released a 17-page manifesto as
its leaders fanned out across the country to hold rallies and tell
the voters that their differences had been swept aside.
   The alliance is comprised of nine parties spanning the
ideological spectrum and bound together largely by their contempt
for the 37-year-old former prime minister.
   Ms. Bhutto has capitalized on their highly publicized bickering
and labeled them the ``remnants of Zia,'' referring to Gen.
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who took power in a coup in 1977 and ruled
until his death in a 1988 plane crash.
   Many Pakistanis have voiced fears that a government headed by
the alliance would resurrect many of Zia's policies, curtailin
individual rights especially for women and non-Moslems.
   Kamal Azfar, special assistant to caretaker Prime Minister
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, sought to dispel the notion. He told a news
conference that the coalition's manifesto ``has some of the
populist promises'' that have been the hallmark of Ms. Bhutto's
left-leaning Pakistan People's Party.
   Among them were increased education and medical care, free
housing for the poor, programs to reduce the country's alarming
birthrate, deregulation of the economy, denationalization of major
industry and financial reforms.
   Ms. Bhutto has yet to announce her party's manifesto. She
currently faces charges of corruption in a special court. Her
husband, Asif Ali Zardari, was arrested Wednesday on a kidnapping
and extortion charge.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissesd Ms. Bhutto's government
Aug. 6 on charges of corruption and mismanagement and set
parliamentary elections for Oct. 24.
   ``The 20 months of PPP rule was a period of anarchy, loot and
plunder of national resources, gross incompetence and breakdown of
law and order,'' the alliance's manifesto said, referring to Ms.
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party.
   ``It was the government of one family, for one family and by one
family,'' the manifesto said.
   The alliance promised ``severe measures to put an end to all
un-Islamic means of ill-gotten wealth, including gambling,
narcotics, blackmarketing, hoarding, smuggling and corruption.''

   A New York art dealer offered the sole bid
Saturday on a long-lost painting and, in his opinion, walked away
with a steal from an auction at an amusement park.
   The 6-foot by 10-foot painting by American landscape artist
Albert Bierstadt of Lake Lucerne and the Swiss Alps was expected to
fetch $1 million. Richard York bought it for half that.
   ``When one examines it as a work of art it has all the elements
that make Bierstadt great,'' York said. ``It's also one of his
first large-scale paintings.''
   York, who owns the Richard York Gallery in New York City, said
he thought the decision to hold the auction at the Rocky Point
Amusement Park may have affected the purchase price.
   ``Maybe it's not the right climate for the picture here,'' he
said, glancing at the faded wine-colored velvet curtains and glitzy
gold drapes that decorate the hall.
   Another large Swiss landscape by Bierstadt went for $990,000 at
Sotheby's New York auction house on May 24.
   The 1858 Lake Lucerne painting was offered about halfway into
the auction of art from the estate of the late Pearl J. Rose.
   Mrs. Rose was secretive about her collection. In fact, she and
her family kept the Bierstadt from the public for more than 100
years since it was last sold in Boston in 1882.
   Bidding had been erratic. A painting by Mauritz Frederik
Hendrick De Haas, expected to bring $13,000, was sold for $50,000.
One by Charles Storer, valued at $4,000, was unsold after there was
no opening bid of $300.
   John Lynch, the estate attorney, said he had inquiries about the
Bierstadt from France, Tokyo, London and around the United States.
   The auctioneer started bidding at $500,000. When none of the 150
registered bidders would offer $600,000, he dropped to $550,000.
Again no takers. He then stopped the auction to confer with
organizers.
   A stunned audience watched as he asked one last time for a
higher bid. York raised his hand.
   Afterward, York said he had been prepared to pay more.
   He would not say if he bought the painting for himself or a
client, or whether it would be staying in the United States.
   Bierstadt, part of the Hudson River group of painters, built his
reputation on panoramic landscapes of the American West.
   Lewis E. Peck, a distant cousin of Mrs. Rose who inherited her
collection when she died in August 1989 at the age of 86, said he
had no regrets about holding the auction at the amusement park.
   ``It's in Rhode Island. That's where it should have stayed,'' he
said. Bierstadt was born in Germany but raised in New Bedford,
Mass.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with deer hunt protest in Texas.</NOTE>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A dozen animal-rights activists were cited for leaving a
designated area in a demonstration Saturday against Florida's
annual Youth Deer Hunt.
   In Texas, protesters who want to test the legality of
hunter-harassment laws in effect in 37 states walked noisily behind
bow-and-arrow hunters to prevent them sneaking up on their prey,
but failed in their primary mission: to get arrested.
   About 80 demonstrators carrying signs and noisemakers marched
for four hours outside the Camp Blanding Wildlife Management Area
in northeast Florida, while 39 young hunters were inside. The
state-sponsored deer hunt is staged to help parents and guardians
teach children 8 to 15 to hunt safely.
   The protesters had a permit to demonstrate across the street
from the park, about a half-mile from the nearest hunting area. But
12 attempted to go inside and were stopped, said Capt. Bill Glover
of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   They were cited for failure to obey lawful order, a misdemeanor.
One also was charged with resisting arrest, Glover said. They were
released pending a court appearance later this month.
   Protesters had planned to make noise and disrupt the hunt, but
Glover said there appeared to be no violations of a new state law
that prohibits interfering with legal hunting, trapping or fishing.
   ``All in all, both the hunt and the protest went pretty
smoothly,'' he said. ``We just had a few who felt like they had to
push their cause and come into an area they couldn't go into.''
   Barry Silver, a Boca Raton lawyer and board member of Florida
Action for Animals, argued that public funds should not be used to
pay for the hunt.
   ``We are against the use of taxpayer money in order to
indoctrinate our youth to become trained killers,'' he said.
``Training children in acts of violence will only encourage them to
become violent later on.''
   In Texas, four teams of 12-15 protesters stationed themselves in
Sam Houston National Park, 55 miles north of Houston, during a
bow-and-arrow hunt, and rustled leaves as they walked behind the
hunters, said Dana Forbes of Fund for Animals.
   Even though the demonstrators were technically violating the
state's hunter-harassment law, game wardens declined to arrest
them, giving them no vehicle with which to challenge the law in
court.
   ``If they have a right to harm these animals, we have a right to
protect them,'' Ms. Forbes said.
   Tommy Johnson, the state game warden for Walker County, said no
one was arrested because none of the hunters seemed to be harassed.
   The protesters ``wanted to have their little say and have their
little day and the hunters were real courteous about it,'' Johnson
said. ``They took a whole lot more abuse than most people should
have to put up with.''
   Ms. Forbes said some hunters ``were obviously very angry, but we
didn't allow anything to get physically violent.''
   Wayne Pacelle, national director of the Fund for Animals, said
Friday that if protesters were arrested, the 23-year-old
organization would take the state to court and possibly use the
arrests to test hunter-harassment laws around the country.
   The group contends that bow-and-arrow hunting is far more cruel
than gun hunting because the animals die slowly or are wounded and
remain crippled.
   State officials said 80,000 hunters in Texas this year applied
for bow licenses, and 1.1 million applied for gun-hunting licenses.

   A national monument etched with the names
of 1,238 firefighters who have died in the line of duty since 1981
was dedicated Saturday at a ceremony that recounted the tales of
fallen heroes.
   President Bush signed legislation in August designating the
9-year-old monument at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg the
official national memorial to career and volunteer firefighters who
died on the job.
   ``While many local communities and states honor their fallen
heroes, this memorial stands as a lasting national tribute to those
who have answered their last alarm,'' said Olin L. Greene,
administrator of the U.S. Fire Administration.
   About 200 people, including state, local and national officials
and firefighters from across the country, attended the outdoor
ceremony held at the 7-foot-tall, pyramid-shaped limestone
monument.
   Honor guard units from Baltimore County and St. Louis marched to
the strains of bagpipes traditionally played at firefighters'
funerals.
   ``In recent years, many people have bemoaned our country's lack
of national heroes,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who
shepherded legislation through Congress to get the memorial
dedicated. ``What they fail to realize is that we do have heroes in
every fire hall across this land.''
   ``No job demands more sacrifice of time and dedication. Sadly,
that sacrifice too often results in death,'' said Wallace E.
Stickney, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
which operates the academy.
   ``We honor that sacrifice now, as we dedicate this fallen
firefighters memorial. This is much more than a memorial. It is
national recognition by President Bush and Congress that these men
and women, who have given their lives, deserve the respect and
honor of all Americans.''
   Alan Lee Mickelson, one of 113 firefighters from 35 states who
died in 1989, fought his last blaze in Gillette, Wyo., on Jan. 31.
   ``He fell 40 feet through a roof in a burning church. The whole
sanctuary roof fell at once. There was no warning at all,'' said
his 34-year-old widow, Marietta Mickelson, who traveled from her
home in northeast Wyoming.
   ``I just think it was something good for my kids to see - a part
of the healing,'' she said. ``It was something we needed to do.''

   Le Duc Tho, the co-founder of the
Vietnamese Communist Party who in 1973 negotiated the U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, died in Hanoi Saturday. Official accounts
said he was 79.
   Tho shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger, with whom he negotiated the Paris Peace
Accords of 1973. But Tho turned it down, saying peace had not yet
been achieved.
   A Foreign Ministry official in the Vietnamese capital confirmed
Tho's death but gave no details.
   Japan's Kyodo's news agency, reporting from Hanoi, said Tho died
of throat cancer. He had been hospitalized at an army hospital
since returning in April from treatment in Paris, the report said.
   Kissinger wrote in a 1982 book, ``Years of Upheaval,'' that
Tho's ``subtlety, his acumen, his iron self-discipline'' were
admirable, and ``in all the years of negotiation with me he never
lost his poise; he never made a mistake.''
   ``As a professional Leninist he despised the bourgeois values of
compromise I put forward,'' Kissinger said, ``and the effrontery of
his deceptions inside and outside the conference room could be
enraging.''
   In April 1975, forces from Communist North Vietnam defeated the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government and reunified the country.
   Tho, known as a hard-line party organizer and theoretician, was
believed to have had a key role in Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia
in late 1978.
   But in 1986, at the Sixth National Party Congress, he and other
veterans were replaced on the Politburo by pragmatists seeking
economic reform. He became an adviser to the party Central
Committee, and Western diplomats said he continued to exercise
considerable influence in the party's conservative wing.
   His younger brother Mai Chi Tho - who is said to share his
hard-line views -is the powerful interior minister in charge of
internal security, and is on the Politburo.
   Last month, Tho was awarded the state's Gold Star Order for his
more than 60 years of political activity.
   ``I pledge to dedicate my utmost efforts, as I have done since I
joined the revolution, to the common cause of the party and the
country,'' he said at the ceremony.
   Much of Tho's life was shrouded in secrecy, like many of the
revolutionaries of his generation. There are several accounts of
his birth.
   Some say he was born to poor parents in a village about 60 miles
south of Hanoi. But other Western biographical sources say his
father was a civil service official of middle rank in the French
colonial administration.
   As a teenager, Tho became involved in left-wing labor and
political movements and helped organize strikes and riots in the
Hanoi area.
   He helped found the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930. During
his imprisonment by the French, his fellow inmates nicknamed him
``Tho the Phonograph'' for his ceaseless recitations of Marxist
doctrine.
   His activities during World War II are a matter of speculation
among Western historians. Some sources say Tho escaped to China and
helped Vietnam's ``revolutionary father'' Ho Chi Minh found the
Viet Minh guerrillas and lead them against the Japanese.
   Others say Tho spent the war years in a French prison in
Vietnam.
   He joined the Politburo in the 1950s and launched attacks
against ``revisionists, defeatists, traitors, pessimists and
individualists.'' But he often called for moderation in healing
party rifts.
   In 1968, with the Vietnam War apparently at a stalemate, the
United States and North Vietnam opened talks toward a cease-fire.
Tho was the North's chief representative at the meetings in Paris.
   The negotiations - some public, others secret - dragged on for
years, with the two sides trying to overcome what Kissinger called
``mountains and ravines'' of complexities.
   Finally, the accord was signed Jan. 27, 1973. It resulted in the
withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, the exchange of prisoners
and the splintering of South Vietnam into Communist and
Saigon-controlled zones.
   But the pact had no machinery for effectively enforcing the
provisions. Fighting continued, and when the North Vietnamese began
their final assault south, Tho was in the south as a direct link
with the Politburo.
   Recalling the talks and the fall of Saigon in 1975, Tho said in
1985 on U.S. television that the Communist side had ``wrested total
victory.''
   Word of Tho's survivors was not immediately released.

   Surgeons removed a bullet Saturday from
the spinal cord of Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, shot at a
restaurant campaign rally the day before by a mentally disturbed
man with drug problems.
   Schaeuble, 48, one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top aides and an
architect of the recent German unification, was in ``satisfactory
and stable'' condition after five hours of surgery to remove the
bullet, hospital officials said.
   German television said he was out of danger, and Lothar Spaeth,
governor of Baden-Wuerttemberg state, said after a visit to the
hospital that Schaeuble stood a chance of full recovery.
   The gunmen fired three times at Schaeuble as he was signing
autographs at the restaurant during a campaign appearance in
Oppenau, in his home district late Friday. The second bullet hit
the right side of Schaueble's face. A third shot struck a
bodyguard, who was in satisfactory condition Saturday.
   Prosecutor Werner Botz identified the gunman as Dieter Kaufmann,
37. Kaufmann told investigators he had acted out of revenge for the
``terror of the state'' and had decided six months ago to shoot
Schaeuble, according to Botz.
   The gunman had been undergoing treatment for schizophrenia,
according to the Interior Ministry. Kaufmann was released from
prison in 1986 after serving three years in jail for a drug
offense.
   He was unemployed and lived with his parents in a nearby
village. The gun he used was a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson
revolver he stole from his father, Botz said.
   On April 26, a mentally disturbed woman attacked Oskar
Lafontaine, the opposition Social Democratic candidate for
chancellor in the Dec. 2 elections. Lafontaine was stabbed in the
neck at a campaign rally, but has since recovered.
   Hans Neusel, the No. 2 official in Schaeuble's ministry, escaped
with superficial injuries when a bomb planted by the Red Army
Faction terrorist gang blew up his car near Bonn in July.
   Schaeuble was taken from Oppenau to a hospital in nearby
Offenburg, and later flown by helicopter to the university hospital
in Freiburg, his home town in southwest Germany.
   Kohl and other politicians visited the Freiburg hospital
Saturday. Schaeuble's wife Ingeborg and their four children were
also at his side.
   Witnesses told German television the gunman sat in the
next-to-last row in the restaurant hall during the rally and fired
as Schaeuble approached.
   One of the minister's guards, Klaus-Dieter Michalski, jumped in
front of Schaeuble to shield him and was shot in the stomach. Botz
said Michalski was ``relatively lightly injured'' and would be
released soon.
   Schaeuble has sometimes been mentioned as a possible successor
to Kohl when the Christian Democratic leader decides to retire.
Schaeuble guided the difficult talks that led to the historic
German unification on Oct. 3.
   He was named interior minister by Kohl in April 1989, and
previously had been the chancellor's chief of staff.

<HEAD>Lafontant Acclaimed At Duvalierist Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The former head of the dreaded
paramilitary police appeared at a political convention Saturday,
defying warrants for his arrest.
   Former Minister of the Interior Roger Lanfontant is wanted for
plotting against national security, but the arrest warrants have
not been served by the army, where he has followers and inspires
fear.
   Lanfontant was head of the Tonton Macoutes, which used terror to
keep the Duvalier family in power for 29 years, until Jean Claude
Duvalier fled in 1986.
   The two-day National Reconciliation Convention on Sunday was to
select a neo-Duvalierist unity candidate for upcoming general
elections.
   Lafontant has been openly campaigning for the presidency,
although the 1987 constitution bars criminal supporters of
dictatorship from running for office until 1997.
   Lafontant's return in July from exile in the Dominican Republic
made many Haitians fear an attempt to disrupt the elections, now
set for Dec. 16.
   In 1987, the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs
with the support of the army murdered at least 34 voters at the
polls. Hundreds more were killed and wounded in pre-election
violence.
   ``We have come out of hiding,'' said Radio Liberte director
Serge Beaulieu at the convention, addressing a cheering crowd of
around 1,500.
   ``We are the power. We will organize elections ourselves; we
don't need the United Nations,'' said Beaulieu, criticizing
soon-to-arrive U.N. election monitors and security experts as an
infringement of national sovereignty.
   The mission of the observers includes trying to assure that
paramilitary and police forces do not intimidate voters.
   On a five-hour visit to Haiti Friday, former President Carter
said the army had not yet arrested Lafontant because he was in
hiding. But in recent weeks Lafontant has been seen in the
provincial towns of Cap-Haitien and Hinche, as well as in the
capital suburb Petionville.
   Other Duvalierist leaders on the podium besides Beaulieu were
Duvalierist militants Alphonse Lahens and Jean Theagene and former
Duvalier-dynasty ministers Herve Boyer, Alix Cineas, and Dr.
Volvick Remy Joseph.
   ``We have not yet chosen our candidate. They are still divided
among themselves,'' said convention moderator Marjorie Robins.
   Dr. Francois Duvalier ruled Haiti from 1957 to 1971. His son
Jean-Claude succeeded him and was ousted on Feb. 7, 1986. He is
living in France.
   ``The doctrine of Dr. Francois Duvalier is very, very fine, but
it must not be applied as it was applied but as he conceived it,''
said Robins.
   On March 13, after four brief military-controlled regimes,
civilian provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot took over and
promised to hold elections.
   The president-elect is to take office on Feb. 7, 1991, on the
fifth anniversary of the ouster of Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   There are about 20 presidential hopefuls.

   Columbia, the shuttle plagued with
mechanical problems since April, was pulled from its hangar again
Saturday night for a trip to the launch pad.
   The nation's oldest flight-qualified orbiter began the six-hour,
4.2 mile ride from to launch pad 39B at 9:03 p.m. EDT. Its
counterpart Atlantis was taken to pad 39A Friday night.
   In late October, Columbia will undergo the first of what may be
several fueling tests. If Columbia passes, its mission to deploy
the $150 million Astro observatory may get under way in December.
   The move was Columbia's sixth since April 22, when it was first
rolled out for a May 30 mission. Hydrogen leaks scrubbed that
launch, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
didn't get a shuttle in orbit until Discovery took off with the
Ulysses solar probe on Oct. 6.
   On June 6, Columbia failed a leak test on the pad and was taken
back to the assembly building for fuel line repairs. On Aug. 9,
Columbia, equipped with a fuel line borrowed from the
still-unfinished shuttle Endeavour, was rolled back to pad 39A.
   An electronic problem with an Astro telescope prompted NASA to
delay a Sept. 1 launch. Then on Sept. 5, hydrogen flooded
Columbia's aft compartment during fueling.
   Columbia's next launch attempt was set for Sept. 18 but once
again, a hydrogen buildup was detected in the engine compartment
and the liftoff was scrubbed.
   At that point, NASA decided Columbia would have to vacate pad
39A to permit Atlantis to be readied for a secret military mission,
which had been on hold since mid-July because of leaking hydrogen.
   After Discovery's launch, Columbia was shifted to pad 39B for an
all-out search for the sources of its hydrogen leaks. The very next
day, the approach of a hurricane forced shuttle managers to bring
Columbia back to its cavernous shelter.

   Homosexuals and lesbians
waving placards marched through the city Saturday to demand equal
rights in what organizers said was Africa's first gay protest
march.
   About 200 men and women chanting ``Gay rights now'' marched for
more than an hour in pouring rain as startled Saturday shoppers
watched.
   Most of the marchers were white men, but women and blacks also
took part. A few marchers wore paper bags over their heads to
conceal their identities.
   Organizers said the struggle for gay rights had to be linked to
the fight for racial equality in South Africa.
   ``With this march, South Africa's gays and lesbians will
actively join the struggle for human rights in South Africa. They
will also finally take their place in a venerable tradition of
worldwide defiance and celebration - the gay liberation movement,''
they said in a statement.
   Dozens of police officers followed the march, which ended
without incident with a picnic in a Johannesburg park.
Homosexuality is illegal in South Africa.
   Some onlookers jeered or heckled the marchers. Two men with
bibles and a loudspeaker yelled that homosexuality was sinful.

<HEAD>Former Silicon Valley Executive Wins $31 Million in Plane Crash
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Silicon Valley executive,
who was maimed when a light plane plummeted onto the busy San Diego
Freeway in 1987, has been awarded a record $31 million, his lawyer
said Saturday.
   Terry O'Reilly, an attorney for Dennis Paboojian, said he
believes the settlement is the largest ever negotiated by a single
person suing for personal injuries. The previous record of $28.5
million was awarded a Salinas woman and her child who were
paralyzed in a 1985 traffic accident, he said.
   Paboojian, 47, lost his left forearm and fingers on his right
hand, was partially paralyzed and suffered burns over 65 percent of
his body when the six-seater Piper Malibu PA-46 he was flying
crashed near Long Beach on Nov. 29, 1987.
   The single-engine plane began having engine trouble over
Southern California, and Paboojian turned the controls over to
flying instructor John Spiesman, who died in the crash.
   The plane, en route from Palomar Airport in San Diego County to
San Jose Airport, came down a half-mile short of Long Beach
Municipal Airport.
   ``The courage involved in his survival is just incredible,''
O'Reilly said.
   Paboojian, of Cupertino, headed Rolm Corp. from January 1986
until April 1987, and then he served as a consultant to the
company.
   The settlement, which will be paid immediately, was ratified
Friday in Santa Clara County Superior Court, O'Reilly said.
Attorneys for Paboojian and Alabama-based Teledyne Continental
Motors, which built the Piper's engine, had been expected to go to
trial next week.
   O'Reilly said the engine maker agreed to pay $20 million. An
additional $11 million will be paid by the airplane maker, Piper
Aircraft, the flight instructor's company, S&amp;G Flight Services of
San Jose, and companies responsible for maintaining and leasing the
plane, among others, O'Reilly said.
   Efforts to reach Teledyne and the other companies for comment
were unsuccessful.
   None of the defendants acknowledged liability for the accident
under terms of the settlement, O'Reilly said.
   Paboojian's lawsuit accused Teledyne of ignoring evidence that
its engines were poorly designed. After the accident, Piper
canceled its contract with Teledyne and began using a different
engine in its planes.

<HEAD>Question of Priests and Marriage Not on Synod Agenda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The issue of whether to allow marriage by
Roman Catholic priests is not on the agenda for the second half a
worldwide gathering of bishops, a spokesman said Saturday.
   Brazilian Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves said discussion groups
scheduled to begin Monday will address a number of topics,
including celibacy and priests' relations with women.
   Bishops from Brazil, Lebanon and the Bahamas had called for
debate on allowing priests to marry. Several said during the synod
that such a change would help resolve the shortage of priests in
certain countries.
   After two weeks of presenting speeches in daily meetings, the
bishops plan to break into groups to help compile a final document
on the synod, called by Pope John Paul II.
   Moreira Neves, the moderator of the conference, said the issues
scheduled to be discussed include: the defense of celibacy;
priests' rapport with women; the role of future priests in the
church and community; the commitment for justice and peace; the
problems of attracting and training priests, and the necessity to
attract new believers.
   The discussion on priests' relations with women would focus on
how young priests can to work with women while avoiding ``both
excessive familiarity and distrustfulness,'' the spokesman said.
   More than 200 bishops are attending the synod.

   Gettysburg College set up an annual award
for encouraging leadership in memory of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who
was born 100 years ago Sunday.
   Another former president, Gerald Ford, announced the $25,000
Eisenhower Leadership Prize at a news conference Saturday attended
by college officials and Eisenhower's grandson, David, who serves
on the college's board of trustees.
   The prize will be given not only to political or military
leaders, but also to emergent leaders in science, medicine,
education and social work, Ford said. Recipients will serve as
guest lecturers at the college.
   ``The prize is unique in that it is aimed at stimulating the
kinds of leadership in a broad, broad sense, that would reflect
what Ike thought was in the best interest of our country,'' Ford
said.
   Eisenhower bought a farm in Gettysburg in 1951 that he used as a
retreat during his presidency and retired there after his second
term ended in 1961. He also had an office at Gettysburg College.
   Eisenhower, who was born in Denison, Texas, died in March 1969
at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Bethesda, Md.
   The first recipient of the award will be named Oct. 14, 1991, by
a 12-member board including David Eisenhower, Dallas industrialist
H. Ross Perot and Drew Lewis, chief executive officer of Union
Pacific Corp.

   Southerners exalted in sunshine Saturday and began bailing out
from the drenching floodwaters left by two tropical storms,
grateful that the threat of a third storm, Lili, was fading.
   But the storms left at least 12 people dead in Georgia, South
Carolina and North Carolina. And although the heavy rains were
forecast to end, residents of low-lying areas were not out of
danger.
   ``Even if it stops raining, the dams could develop problems two
or three days from now,'' said George Ballenger, chief of dams and
reservoir safety in Columbia, S.C.
   ``There's a lag time between the time the water falls and works
its way down to the dam,'' Ballenger said.
   Still, the clear skies offered a welcome respite.
   ``The sun's shining brightly,'' said Gwen White, a spokeswoman
for the Dare County emergency operations in North Carolina, on
Saturday. ``I don't even know if we're going to get any rain out of
it.''
   Lili was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm shortly
before 6 a.m. Saturday, and all tropical storm watches and warnings
were canceled along the mid-Atlantic coast. At 10:30 p.m. EDT
Saturday, Lili's center was located near latitude 37.1 north,
longitude 70.9 west, or about 280 miles south of Nantucket Island,
Mass.
   Lili was expected to increase in forward speed and turn toward
the northeast. Its maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph, down
from 60 mph at 6 p.m. EDT, and some decrease in strength was
forecast.
   Head-high waves Friday afternoon claimed a 10-foot section of
dune fence near the base of the Cape Hatteras lighthouse. The
century-old safety beacon, the oldest on the East Coast, was in no
imminent danger, authorities said.
   ``The rains have stopped in the western part of the state and,
of course, in the eastern part of the state, Hurricane Lili has
gone way offshore,'' said Graham Wilson, spokesman for the State
Emergency Response Team in North Carolina. ``The problem in the
western part of the state is still some water on the roads.''
   More than 2,000 South Carolinians were told Friday night to
evacuate their homes as rivers and creeks swelled around the state
and threatened to flood more low-lying areas.
   Earlier, residents boarded up their windows along North
Carolina's Outer Banks, shelters were readied and some tourists
fled, but the state was spared Lili's full brunt, forecasters said.
   At least 12 people died in the onslaught of tropical storms
Marco and Klaus.
   A 2-year-old boy died Friday in South Carolina after he wandered
away from home. Four others drowned Wednesday when a dam broke,
including a 10-year-old boy whose body was not found until
Saturday.
   Rising waters in Georgia killed four people, including an
80-year-old man as he and his wife struggled to leave a flooded
railroad track.
   One person drowned and two died in storm-related traffic
accidents in North Carolina.
   In Florida, cleanup was under way along the central Gulf Coast,
where Marco caused $1.5 million in damage.
   ``When it hit here, it slammed us,'' said Joe Miller, Manatee
County parks director. ``I'm still amazed. I'd hate to see a
hurricane.''

   A gas line from a propane truck to a
tank at a tortilla factory broke and exploded Saturday, killing the
manager of the establishment and three boys, the fire department
said.
   The four victims were burned to death and at least seven other
people suffered severe burns, said Fire Chief Jaime Espinoza.
   The kitchen and seven nearby houses were in flames when firemen
arrived, he said.
   Crews had difficult reaching the Simon Bolivar neighborhood
where the explosion occurred because of poor roads to the hastily
constructed shantytown. Its cardboard and plank cabins perch on the
edge of the hotel district of this Pacific Coast resort.
   Four months ago a similar gas explosion killed several people in
Acapulco, Espinoza said.

   Afghan troops fighting near Kabul
captured a large cache of weapons and ammunition from Moslem
guerrillas, who recently increased their attacks on the capital,
Afghanistan's official radio said.
   ``The Kabul garrison contingent launched a successful cleanup
operation south of the city and gained new ground,'' Kabul Radio
said in a broadcast monitored in Islamabad. ``The soldiers are
fighting in high spirits.''
   The radio said several heavy machine guns, hundreds of missiles,
rocket-propelled grenades, anti-personnel mines and 100 pounds of
explosives were seized or destroyed.
   The report could not be independently confirmed.
   Earlier this month, fundamentalist guerrillas stepped up their
rocket attacks on the capital in preparation for a major assault
against the Soviet-backed government of Kabul, diplomatic sources
said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party members opened a
regional conference Saturday amid mounting protests provoked by a
party leader critical of some reforms, the state CTK news agency
reported.
   A rally by about 4,000 anti-Communist demonstrators, organized
by the governing Civic Forum and other gruops, was held outside the
Communist congress for Bohemia and Moravia, which opened in
Olomouc, about 140 miles southeast of Prague.
   On Thursday, the Czechoslovak government proposed seizing all
Communist Party property without compensation. The Communists were
driven from power by a pro-democracy meeting last year.
   ``We are witnessing an open drive of right-wing forces,'' CTK
quoted Jiri Machalik, chairman of the regional Communist Party of
the Czech lands, as saying in his opening speech to the congress.
   ``Basically, we do not reject privatization ... but the
privatization should not be the goal, it should be the means to
increase the efficiency of the national economy,'' he said.
   Anti-Communist sentiment swelled quickly after comments earlier
this week by party chairman Vasil Mohorita, who criticized
Czechoslovakia's economic reform as a de facto return to capitalism
and called for a ``hard and uncompromising struggle.''
   Over 50,000 people jammed Prague's Old Town Square Thursday to
protest his remarks.
   Civic Forum, the country's leading political force, also
convened a two-day meeting Saturday to discuss strategy for
communal elections in November, CTK reported.
   Although Civic Forum began as a loose coalition of democratic
forces, delegates at the meeting urged forming a more solid
organization.
   ``We should transform the ad lib structure of the movement into
something similar to a political party,'' said Pavel Rychetsky,
Czechoslovak vice premier and a Civic Forum leader.
   The 11-month-old movement elected Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus
as its first chairman Saturday, CTK said.

   Making common cause with its new Arab
allies, the United States has joined the rest of the Security
Council in denouncing Israeli authorities for killing 19
Palestinians during rioting in Jerusalem.
   In its unanimous vote late Friday, the council asked for a U.N.
investigation of the deaths. But Israel said it would not allow
such a mission on its territory.
   The U.S. vote for the resolution represented a rare departure
from the usual American practice of defending Israel, its longtime
ally, from censure in the council.
   The last U.S. vote against Israel in the United Nations was in
1988 over the Israeli practice of expelling suspected leaders of
the Arab uprising, known as the intefadeh.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate Finance Committee approved a
middle-of-the-road budget-cutting plan early today that raises some
taxes on the wealthy and boosts the levy on gasoline.
   The panel adopted the plan on a bipartisan 15-5 vote, leaving
the Senate in sharp contrast with the more fractious House.
   In that chamber, Democrats have endorsed a liberal package
containing sharper tax increases for the wealthy. Republicans are
torn between a more conservative proposal bearing President Bush's
plan to cut the capital gains tax, or perhaps offering nothing at
all.
   ``I believe it is a fair compromise,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, just before the post-midnight
Finance panel vote.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawmakers are voicing concern that the level
of military spending approved by Congress in its budget resolution
is too high for a nation facing an economic crisis.
   ``This isn't about a war with the Russians. This isn't about a
war in the Middle East. This is about the economic survival of this
country,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., prior to House
approval Friday of a $268 billion defense bill.
   By a vote of 322-97, the House adopted a military spending bill
that cuts off production of the B-2 bomber at 15 planes and slashes
President Bush's budget request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   The House bill meets the level of defense spending worked out by
the House and Senate last week in a budget resolution seeking to
cut $500 billion from the federal deficit over the next five years.

   BERLIN (AP) - A lone assailant has shot and seriously wounded
Germany's top law enforcement official, but officials say the
attacker had a history of mental problems and that terrorists were
not involved.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, considered a possible
future candidate for chancellor, was shot late Friday at a campaign
meeting at a restaurant in Oppenau, about 120 miles south of
Frankfurt.
   Television reports said a security guard was also seriously
wounded when he threw himself in front of Schaeuble.
   After Friday's attack, Schaeuble was hospitalized in Freiburg.
Interior Ministry spokesman Roland Bachmeier said Schaeuble was
``seriously wounded'' but that his life was not in danger.

   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - The government has suddenly switched
to painful and politically risky capitalist reform, raising fears
of winters as cold and dark as those imposed by executed Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   It cut energy subsidies and credits to the country's chronically
inefficient government-owned industries and said the same treatment
was in store for private consumers.
   On Friday it said the country's second-largest automaker will be
allowed to go bankrupt if it can't pay its debts.
   Officials also have put Romanians on notice that
state-controlled prices will go up, and that the country can afford
no more across-the-board wage increases. Economics Minister Eugen
Dijmarescu warned that could cause civil unrest.
