   World chess champion Garry Kasparov and his
blood rival Anatoly Karpov played to a draw Monday in the opening
game of their grudge match.
   Kasparov, playing the black pieces, offered the draw after
making his 30th move, and Karpov accepted.
   For the first game of the match at the Hudson Theatre in
Manhattan, about 700 black and grey tweed seats were sold out at
$25, $50 and $100. Karpov made his first move at about 5:40 p.m.
EDT and the game ended shortly before 10:30 EDT. The second game of
the best-of-24-game match is scheduled for Wednesday.
   Kasparov, 27, ended Karpov's 10-year world chess reign in 1985.
Now, Karpov, 39, is trying to wrest the title back as the nemeses
meet for the first time in three years.
   As the play began, the crowd was hushed, except for the click of
journalists' cameras. The audience let out a ``shhhh!'' in unison
when someone spoke in the back of the theater.
   Five minutes into the game, Karpov left the stage. Two officials
came out, carried away his chair, then brought it back.
   Karpov was outwardly calm, with an expression that looked like
he had just awakened. He hugged his hands to his chest, with his
fingers laced together. A few times, he stared vacantly beyond the
bright stage lights, toward the audience.
   Kasparov pressed his chest against the table and fidgeted:
bouncing one foot, puffing out his cheeks, scowling, wincing,
pursing his lips. He often assumed his most famous pose: cheeks or
forehead enveloped in both hands.
   Each player occasionally strode into the wings while his
opponent contemplated.
   American Grand Master Yasser Seirawan, of Seattle, said Karpov
seemed to have a good chance in the opening game.
   Seirawan said he thought Karpov's strong play indicated to
Kasparov that ``Yes, you're the world champion, but I'm a worthy
challenger.''
   One of Karpov's aides, U.S. Grand Master Ron Henley, of New
Jersey, said that, during the early part of the game, Kasparov
``was positioned slightly more comfortably'' on the board.
   It is the first world championship in the United States since
1907. After the first 12 games are played in New York, 12 more will
be played in Lyon, France, beginning Nov. 24.
   For the New York showdown, the theater is hung with the flags of
the United States, France and the Soviet Union, home country of
both players.
   Above the stage is a 10-foot screen bearing the image of a chess
board. When Kasparov or Karpov makes a move, the pieces on the
screen move, too, for the audience's benefit.
   Two video screens show close-ups of the players. The
computerized chess board will record every move they make.
   The board is atop a stark, black table, with two name tags
pasted on the front.
   One, labeled ``A. Karpov,'' depicts the Soviet flag. Next to the
table is Karpov's black, high-backed easy chair, which swivels and
rolls.
   On the opposite side is a black, low-backed, office-style chair.
That side is labeled ``G. Kasparov,'' with a depiction of the flag
of the Russian Republic.
   Kasparov, founder of a Soviet democratic party, declared last
week he was playing under the flag of the republic rather than the
Soviet Union as a political statement. Karpov often has been quoted
as saying, ``I have two loves: communism and chess.''
   ``Normally, chess is a battle between two individuals: a brutal,
intellectual battle,'' Kasparov said earlier. ``But in my case,
with Karpov, it's a fight between two different mentalities in
Russia. I identify him with the system I've been fighting.''
   Years ago, a chess analyst likened Kasparov's agile, bold style
to the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Karpov's methodical, rigid
style to former Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev.
   The two are as different in personality as they are in political
leanings.
   Kasparov, who beat ``Deep Thought,'' a chess-playing computer,
in New York last January, is confident, flamboyant and fluent in
English - a media darling who tirelessly publicizes chess.
   The media have often described Karpov as cool or even cold: an
introvert who plays with surgical precision and tunes out the
audience. But he was personable at a news conference last Tuesday,
hamming it up and presenting a copy of his book to Kasparov.
   The first championship between the two, in 1984, was abruptly
helted by the World Chess Federation president after Karpov lost
two games in a row. In a controversial move, the World Chess
Federation permitted Karpov to retain the title although the match
wasn't completed.
   Kasparov won their 1985 rematch, becoming the youngest champion
ever. He successfully defended the title against Karpov in 1986. In
1987, their championship match ended in a tie and Kasparov retained
his title under the match rules.
   This time, the winner will receive $1.7 million and the loser
will get $1.3 million. Kasparov said his earnings will fund ``my
private interests and the political interests of the world.''
Karpov has talked about helping Chernobyl victims and promoting
chess in schools.

<TEXT>
   A freight train derailed Monday in an crash
of splintered railroad ties and twisted steel, and a flatcar
slammed into an apartment building, stopping just short of a woman
and her children.
   Nobody was injured in the 10:10 a.m. derailment of the Santa Fe
Railway train, the third time in a month a train jumped the tracks
in Southern California and the second close call between residents
and a derailed train.
   The cause of Monday's derailment was under investigation.
   ``I was very afraid,'' said Irma Quintanar, who was sweeping her
second-story balcony as er two children played nearby when the
flatcar smashed into the side of her building just a few feet away.
   Nine cars of the Los Angeles-bound 53-car Santa Fe Railway train
derailed about 40 yards east of the building, tearing up 600 yards
of track, smashing telephone poles and splintering railroad ties.
   Most of the cars tumbled to their sides against the side of the
lowered railway bed, but a flatcar carrying white truck trailers
buckled at a right angle, smashed into three parked cars, and hit
the apartment building.
   The train demolished a stairwell, knocked out an
8-foot-by-8-foot hole in the downstairs unit and crumbled and
cracked part of the living room wall of Quintanar's upstairs unit.
   Large chunks of drywall littered Quintanar's living room, and a
piece of the ceiling fell onto the couch.
   ``I feel very lucky,'' Quintanar said in Spanish through an
interpreter. ``If my children were inside, it would have been very
bad.''
   Francisco Covarrubias, who lives at the other end of the
complex, said children were playing in the complex on the warm
Columbus Day holiday when he heard what seemed like an explosion
and felt the ground shaking.
   ``It's confusion. You really don't know what's coming. You feel
the danger coming but you don't know from where,'' he said. ``I
first looked up at the sky to see if something was coming down.''
   Authorities evacuated the apartment building.
   Though no injuries were reported, one pregnant woman was taken
to a hospital for observation, said Assistant Chief Bob Ramirez of
the Los Angeles Fire Department.
   Santa Fe Railway Assistant Superintendent Neal Leaverton said
the cause of the derailment was unknown. He also did not know how
fast the train was traveling when it derailed on a wide, downhill
curve.
   The derailment was the third in the Los Angeles area in the last
month.
   Fourteen runaway railroad cars collided with a locomotive in
Pico Rivera on Sept. 9, and nine cars derailed, one of them landing
just inches from a home.
   About two weeks later a boxcar loaded with Navy munitions jumped
the tracks in Westminster. No one was injured in either derailment.

<HEAD>Aid to UNITA Rebels at a Crossroads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
switching back to Cold War-era language in an effort to defeat a
House move to cut off U.S. aid to anti-communist rebels in Angola.
   In a private memo he sent recently to House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., Baker said ending aid to the Angolan rebels
would derail peace negotiations ``and would be a vote for more
killing, more stalemate and more suffering.''
   This is ``the absolutely worst time'' to halt the aid, Baker
said.
   The United States has been providing covert aid to the UNITA
rebels in the southwest African country since 1986, but
congressional sentiment against continued assistance seems to be
increasing.
   At stake is a reported $60 million for the rebels in the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1. The issue could go to the House floor this
week.
   Critics of administration policy contend that more aid to the
rebels will only prolong a conflict that has lasted 15 years and
caused immense human suffering. They also point out that well over
half the 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola have gone home. The rest
will be out in less than nine months.
   One amendment before the House would cut off all U.S. aid to
UNITA unless President Bush declares that vital national security
interests are at stake.
   Another would require an aid cutoff unless Bush certifies that
the Soviet Union or third parties are continuing to send weapons to
the leftist government in Luanda. U.S. aid also could be restored
if Angola refused to continue peace negotiations with UNITA in good
faith.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has said his
government will halt all weapons imports if UNITA does the same. He
also has said he is committed to instituting a multi-party
democratic system in Angola.
   The Angola issue features a curious mixture of Soviet-American
competition and cooperation.
   On one hand, Moscow and Washington have been arming opposite
sides. On the other, Soviet and American representatives were
present for the first time at the most recent negotiating session
between Angolan officials and UNITA envoys. Four rounds of peace
talks have been held in Lisbon and a fifth is scheduled there for
later this month.
   Another anomaly is that the United States, although it does not
recognize the Angolan government, is that country's largest trading
partner because of oil purchases.
   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was in Washington last week, making
his case for continued U.S. aid. He agrees with the administration
that U.S. aid has forced the Angolan government to the bargaining
table and that a cutoff could put his goal of a cease-fire and free
elections beyond reach.
   Baker concurs. In his memo to Michel, a copy of which was made
available to The Associated Press, Baker said an aid suspension
would undercut those in the Angolan government who want to
negotiate and ``strengthen the hand of hardliners who want to
continue the bloodshed.''
   Angola's United Nations ambassador, Manuel Pedro Pacavira,
counters by saying that continued aid to UNITA can no longer be
justified because of the toll of 15 years of warfare.
   ``Our people have suffered enough,'' Pacavira has said. ``More
than 50,000 people are amputees, most of them women and children,
and more than 800,000 civilians face starvation resulting from the
combination of war and drought. This is the legacy of war, a legacy
we can change now.''

<HEAD>Some Debtor Countries Have Simply Stopped Paying Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debtor countries that can't get new loans from
banks have found a new way to accumulate some of the hard cash they
need: they just don't pay interest on their loans.
   Some countries stopped payments on their loan principals in
1982. But interest is how banks get their money and the cutoff is a
new blow to international lenders.
   ``In effect, if you don't pay interest on an old loan, you've
got yourself the equivalent of a new one,'' said John Underwood,
who specializes in international debt at World Bank headquarters.
   The failure to pay interest has dramatically increased Third
World debt in the 18 months since the United States launched a new
attack on indebtedness.
   Countries in the Third World and Eastern Europe owe $1.3
trillion, and $90 billion to $95 billion a year in interest on that
debt, Underwood estimated.
   There is no estimate available of how much of that interest is
in arrears, but the 16 most heavily indebted countries are $22
billion behind in interest payments. They were $7 billion behind in
March 1989 when U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady launched his
debt reduction plan.
   The calculations come from the Institute of International
Finance, headed by Horst Schulmann, once adviser to former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and now a spokesman for major
banks worldwide.
   ``It is hard to avoid the conclusion that some of these
countries are pursuing a policy of willfully accruing arrears,''
Schulmann said at a recent news conference.
   Willful or not, there's not much the lenders can do about it.
   As borrowers, countries aren't like their citizens. If a
homeowner or a small business fails to keep up loan payments, the
lender takes over the house or car or whatever collateral was put
up for the loan.
   Banks don't ask a sovereign government to put up collateral.
They can do little about one that turns out to be a deadbeat: there
is no such thing as a bankruptcy court for governments.
   Schulmann has asked the 154-nation International Monetary Fund
to pressure the debtors by refusing to lend its money to countries
that are behind in interest payments to banks.
   The debt problem first surfaced in 1982, when Mexico announced
it was unable to keep up its debt payments because of high interest
rates and the collapse of its income from oil exports. Many other
debtor countries stopped payments on the principal of their debt
but continued to pay interest.
   Now some have added to their stock of cash by slowing down their
interest payments, too.
   Brazil, for example, was $3.43 billion behind in 1987. Banks and
the IMF worked out a deal that brought Brazil up to date in 1988.
   Early in 1989, Brazil stopped paying interest again and now is
about $10 billion behind on about $67 billion worth of debt it owes
to banks. Its total debt, about $117 billion, is the largest in the
Third World.
   In 1985, then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, now
secretary of state, proposed to help them with new loans. But
banks, unwilling to throw good money after bad, reduced their
lending instead of increasing it.
   Baker's successor, Brady, then proposed his plan, urging a
reduction in the debt burden and more new lending. But that hasn't
brought much new lending either.
   Third World debtors still need new money for the goods they want
to buy from industrial countries, which want to be paid in U.S.
dollars and other hard currencies. The goods are needed to build
plants that will provide jobs and things to buy for rapidly growing
Third World populations.
   Underwood of the World Bank suggested that the arrears to the
banks may be just a ``negotiating phase'': governments may be
holding back interest payments on the old loans in the hope of
pressing the banks to give them new loans.
   John Cavanagh, who follows the issue at the private,
left-of-center Institute for Policy Studies, has a different
explanation.
   ``Some small countries like Costa Rica have been getting away
with not paying much interest for years,'' he said. ``The banks
didn't fuss as long as the countries didn't trumpet it. Now some of
the bigger debtor countries have found they can get away with it
too, as long as they pay a few key creditors.''

<HEAD>Academic Must Tape Lectures on Race and Intelligence For Secret
Viewing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Professor Philippe Rushton has been confined to
lecturing into a video camera at Western Ontario University, where
his theories on race and intelligence have made him a discomforting
presence.
   Since the academic year began, students taking Rushton's
undergraduate course - Theories of Personality - have been obliged
to pick up his 90-minute taped lectures, view each one alone and in
seclusion, and telephone the psychology professor with any
questions.
   Rushton gained notoriety throughout North America by announcing
that his research showed whites were more intelligent than blacks,
Orientals were more intelligent that whites and the reasons were
genetic and evolutionary.
   University officials say the special treatment of Rushton's
lectures is necessary to avoid disturbances, even violence, by some
elements on the campus at London, Ontario.
   Rushton responded in an interview: ``In my view, it's an
infringement of my academic freedom because I cannot discuss my
views with the students and the students are not allowed to
challenge me. The whole normal student-teacher relationship is
gone.''
   His performance evaluation also has been dropped from a
consistent ``very good'' or ``excellent'' to ``unsatisfactory.''
That could have been the first step in an administration attempt to
fire him, but the university senate grievance committee overturned
the Psychology Department evaluation on Oct. 2.
   ``That means I get a pay increase,'' Rushton said, ``and most
importantly, it removes any possibility of the university
initiating dismissal proceedings against me on those grounds.''
   Administration officials deny the university is trying to muzzle
or harass Rushton or interfere with his academic freedom.
   ``No one involved thinks videotaping lectures is the best
solution to the problem, but it's the only one we could come up
with that we think is viable,'' said Dr. Tom Collins, vice
president for academics. A lot of people are critical of that
situation.''
   Rushton, 46, has been at Western Ontario for 13 years and, until
January 1989, labored in relative obscurity.
   He was known in academia as co-author of the best-selling
textbook ``Introduction to Psychology'' and won a Guggenheim
research fellowship in 1988.
   Then came his 20-minute speech to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.
   Many scientists stormed out of the hall in San Francisco when
Rushton set out his thoughts on genetic and evolutionary
differences between the races.
   ``My conclusions are totally unpopular,'' he admitted in the
interview.
   ``I conclude that, on 50 or 60 different measures, orientals and
blacks are at opposite ends of a continuum with whites, or
caucasoids, falling consistently somewhere in the middle. These
measures include intelligence, sexual behavior, brain size, law
abidingness, social organization skills, personality and
temperament and speed of physical maturation.''
   Rushton also teaches a graduate course called Human Life
History, covering the evolutionary basis of personality.
   Only two students are enrolled and he teaches it ``more or less
normally,'' he said. ``We meet once a week in a location that is
kept secret from everybody but me and the two students.''
   For the 12 undergraduates in his Theories of Personality course,
he goes to a different classroom each week to tape a lecture.
   ``Normally, there would be up to 50 students in this class,'' he
said.
   The students are allowed to telephone him during one hour a week
to ask questions or make appointments. An appeal of the ruling that
he must teach by videotape is still before the university senate.
   ``This is consuming an enormous amount of my time,'' Rushton
complained.
   Collins, the university vice president, said when asked whether
the university was embarrassed by the professor: ``In the
university in general, some people are embarrassed by his work. The
official stance is he has academic freedom and will be judged by
his peers.''
   Rushton says racial difference is a fascinating question on
which he has worked since 1981 and published since 1984, ``even
getting ratings of excellent from the university for my race work.
It was when it began to be public that the ax began to come down on
my head.''
   Race is a taboo, he said, but that ``only goes back to the
Second World War, as a result of Hilter's so-called racial policy.
In the aftermath of World War II, there has been a virtual
self-imposed taboo on the scientific study of race differences from
a genetic perspective.''
   No known environmental cause explains the differences between
races, according to Rushton.
   ``Things like white racism and poverty just don't do it,'' he
said.
   ``If I had said either that the differences do not exist, or if
I had said they do exist and it's all due to white racism, then I
would not have run into trouble. But once you suggest genetics or
evolution in the context of race, you're in for trouble, and I knew
I would be.''
   Rushton says he does not like being unpopular and that he wants
to make a contribution to science and be rewarded with approval for
doing so.
   ``I do not like to have my views totally unpopular as they
are,'' he said, ``but I do believe I'm right. I feel that this is
something that is going to be recognized.''

   Oleg Kalugin made good, just like his U.S.
classmates knew he would.
   We elected him president of the Class of '59 at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism and picked him as the
student most likely to succeed - in the Soviet Union.
   Unknown to us, the KGB also had Oleg pegged as a winner and was
using the student exchange program to groom him as an undercover
agent. The Soviet agency ultimately promoted him to the rank of
major general in recognition of 30 years of outstanding service in
the spy business.
   Kalugin's class ties became tenuous after graduation, although
he spent much of the next decade in the United States. During that
time, he assumed various roles, including those of Soviet radio and
TV correspondent at the United Nations in New York and press
attache at the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
   After being compromised by a Jack Anderson column, Oleg left the
United States in 1970. The columnist described him as a ``Russian
Romeo'' who attempted to seduce an FBI office secretary to gain
access to classified information.
   Now Kalugin has come in from the cold in a very big and
surprising way. He even has won a seat in the Soviet parliament.
   At age 55, Oleg Danilovich Kalugin seems to have taken to heart
the old Columbia fight song ``Roar, Lion, Roar.'' The former KGB
officer is suing the Soviet government to win back the rank,
pension and honors he lost in retribution for publicly criticizing
his spy masters.
   He accused the long dreaded KGB of a continuing abuse of power
despite its ``new image.''
   Kalugin won a round in court on Oct. 2 when a Soviet judge
ordered the government to provide a fuller explanation for its
decision to degrade him.
   In hailing the court decision, Oleg sounded like he had been
taking notes during Columbia lectures on freedom of the press.
Soviet society was being pushed toward ``the stage where all secret
acts, illegal acts, will slowly and gradually be done away with,''
he said
   We had a different impression of him at Columbia. As a student,
he was convincing in the role of a dedicated Communist. He had an
easy smile, but tended to be stiff and guarded in conversation. At
the time, the 24-year-old Leningrad native was a member of the
Young Communist League.
   ``Basically, he wasn't that friendly a classmate and I don't
think he made any close friends at the school,'' recalled Robert
Resnick, now a public issues consultant and speech writer.
   While the rest of us were in journalism school of our own
volition, Kalugin clearly was not.
   Once when I asked him if he expected to work as a reporter after
graduation, he replied, ``I imagine so. Why else would THEY have
sent me here.''
   Some had their suspicions, even then. Classmate John Palmer,
until recently news anchor of NBC's ``The Today Show'' and now in
syndication with the program ``Instant Recall,'' remembers a
Columbia professor remarking of Kalugin, ``He's a colonel in the
KGB, didn't you know?''
   ``I gave him such an incredulous look, and thought, `What are
you some kind of a rightwinger,' '' Palmer said, adding that he now
owed the professor an apology.
   We elected Oleg class president more in jest than in tribute to
his popularity. His classmates included Korean War veterans whose
irreverence foreshadowed the '60s generation.
   ``We did it as a joke,'' Resnick said.
   The election prompted the New York Times to select the new class
president as a Man in the News, describing him as a ``real
personality kid'' who loved movies and Big Band jazz, but abhorred
the new sounds of rock 'n' roll.
   Classmate John Cunniff, now an AP business columnist, remembers
Kalugin first appearing at the school in a shabby suit and
gradually becoming a nattier dresser. Showing off a new dress shirt
to Cunniff one day, Oleg boasted, ``The Arrow shirt - it is the
best.''
   ``All that time he spent in Columbia and the States must have
had an impact on him,'' Cunniff remarked.
   In May of 1959, Kalugin and 17 other members of the class
traveled to Upstate New York to spend a day putting out an edition
of the Middletown Times Herald. Oleg's story ran on the front page
under the headline ``Soviet Visitor Likes City.''
   He found Middletown ``typically American,'' with its
supermarkets and good roads. He encountered no open hostility, but
reported finding ``much misunderstanding about the intentions and
the policies of the Soviet Union'' under Nikita Khrushchev.
   When Oleg steered his conversation with one town official toward
the subject of U.S.-Soviet relations, the official asked: ``Are you
Russian or something?''
   Three decades later, this same Russian, for whatever motives he
may have, is openly challenging the intentions and policies of his
own government and the secret police he served with distinction for
three decades.
   ``I hope to achieve one thing: that other people, based on this
precedent, will act more bodly and courageously in their attempts
to restore justice and their human rights,'' the former spy told
reporters in Moscow after his latest court appearance.
   Oleg, we hardly knew you.

   The collapse of a military revolt on
Mindanao island offers no guarantee that unrest in the ranks will
stop unless President Corazon Aquino solves major problems facing
the nation, analysts believe.
   More importantly, there is a growing feeling that the system
Mrs. Aquino installed after the 1986 ``people power revolution''
toppled the late Ferdinand Marcos is cumbersome and unresponsive.
   The latest uprising ended Saturday. Renegade Col. Alexander
Noble surrendered two days after seizing military garrisons in two
cities and proclaiming independence for the country's
second-largest island.
   Some government officials feared Noble aimed to trigger
uprisings elsewhere in the archipelago, culminating in yet another
coup attempt.
   Mrs. Aquino and her staunchest supporters dismiss the seven
military revolts that have broken out during her 4{ years in office
as simply attempts to ``grab power'' and crush democracy.
   But many prominent politicians, commentators and business
leaders feel the conspirators have raised valid issues, although
there is widespread suspicion of their motives and methods.
   These include favoritism in military promotions, government
corruption, poverty, and the failure to deliver basic services in
this land of 60 million people.
   ``There is no guarantee that some other disaffected, disgusted
and idealistic officers and men will not follow the way of the
rebel because the root causes of the coups and mutinies have not
been addressed or eradicated,'' wrote commentator Luis Beltran in
The Manila Standard.
   ``Until those root causes are removed, the Aquino administration
will continue as an accident ready to happen - and happen it
will,'' he added.
   Following the December coup attempt - the bloodiest yet with
more than 100 people killed - Mrs. Aquino appointed a commission to
determine why the rebellions have occurred. Ironically, the
commission released its report on Thursday - the day Noble launched
his rebellion.
   In an interview with the Philippines News and Features
syndicate, commission member Delfin Lazaro said pro-coup sentiment
existed in at least 12 major units within the 160,000-member armed
forces.
   ``It appears that coups are still likely to happen,'' Lazaro
said.
   Another commission member, Dr. Carolina Hernandez, said the
government must demonstrate to disaffected military groups that
``it is concerned about the issues being raised.''
   ``The reason why they (troops) are involved is because they are
involved in peace and order and (the delivery of basic services),
so they feel they should have a say in all these things that go
on.''
   Critics claim the Aquino government rarely shows interest in
demands of special interest groups, including Moslems, workers,
teachers or soldiers, unless they pose a threat.
   The coup investigating commission also pointedly faulted Mrs.
Aquino for poor leadership and lack of vision.
   ``While there is understandably a reluctance by President Aquino
to exercise power in the manner that might be compared with former
President Marcos, a democracy in a crisis of transition calls for a
firmer and more direct hand at the helm,'' the report said.
   Moreover, the system Mrs. Aquino restored four years ago has
itself proven inadequate for decisive action.
   Apart from a bloated bureaucracy, the new constitution restored
a legislature whose two chambers often have vastly different
agendas.
   The 23 senators are elected by voters nationwide, and many
appear to be trying to use the chamber as a springboard to the
presidency. House members, elected by district, tend to reflect
local views.
   Without established, well-organized political parties to
discipline members, legislation often takes months to enact,
usually with numerous amendments, backroom deals and compromises.
   Several prominent politicians including House Speaker Ramon
Mitra have suggested shifting to a unicameral, parliamentary-style
government in which the administration could be changed
constitutionally if it were to lose its mandate.
   Former Labor Minister Blas Ople, an opposition member of the
Aquino-appointed commission that drafted the 1987 constitution, has
said that its framers' biggest mistake was to re-establish a
bicameral system.
   Critics also say the system is too highly centralized.
   Politicians in Cebu, Mindanao and other provincial centers
complain that Manila exerts far too much control than is workable
in an archipelago of 7,100 islands with more than 80 languages and
dialects.
   Noble's allies claimed their goal was to establish an
independent state on Mindanao and then to reunite the southern
island with other parts of the country in a federal system.
   There is little sign that the coup attempts have generated any
significant, broad-based civilian support. Although the December
putsch nearly toppled the government, few believed Noble would
succeed in ousting Mrs. Aquino.
   But each revolt tarnishes the reputation of the government,
frightens foreign investors and demoralizes the public.
   During a speech Friday, Herman Montenegro, chairman of the
annual conference of the Chamber of Commerce, warned the government
``must dispel the fear that a military coup is a distinct
possibility at any time.''

<HEAD>Alaskans May Vote Away Right to Smoke Marijuana</HEAD>

   The most liberal marijuana law in the
country may go up in smoke on Election Day.
   Amid rising nationwide intolerance of drugs, Alaskan voters who
have been able to legally possess small amounts of marijuana for 15
years appear ready to trade in their right to puff, a poll showed.
   Adults in Alaska can possess less than four ounces of marijuana
legally in their homes or other private places, but an initiative
on the Nov. 6 ballot would make possession of pot illegal anywhere.
   If passed, the measure would make possession a misdemeanor
punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   The bill is the latest and most ambitious effort to erode the
gains of the marijuana-reform movement of the 1970s, when 11 states
relaxed pot penalties. It has attracted strong interest and big
money from outside the state.
   President Bush's drug czar William Bennett has endorsed the
measure and plans to visit Alaska later in the month to campaign
for it. Federal agencies have been involved, too.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI recently helped
sponsor a symposium in Anchorage titled: ``Marijuana Myths and
Misconceptions.''
   The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has
made defeat of the measure a top priority. By late September, NORML
had contributed nearly $16,000 to campaign efforts to defeat the
measure, according to the Alaska Public Offices Commission.
   ``Not defeating this initiative means that we will be facing
trouble in dozens of other states in 1992,'' NORML director Donald
B. Fiedler said in a recent fund-raising letter. ``We must preserve
the status quo in Alaska.''
   High Times, a New York-based magazine that advocates legalizing
marijuana, is urging readers to travel to Alaska this month to
counter Bennett and defeat the measure.
   The magazine calls the initiative ``the year's gravest challenge
to the marijuana-legalization movement.''
   ``Don't risk bringing pot, we have the best up here,'' its
October issue advises.
   A statewide survey in August showed voters supported the measure
by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Anchorage pollster Dave Dittman said.
Opponents say they'll gain ground in the next few weeks when their
campaign goes into full swing.
   There have been repeated efforts to toughen laws in most of the
11 states that decriminalized marijuana in the '70s.
   Lawmakers in Oregon, the first state to decriminalized
possession of small amounts in 1973, raised the $100 maximum fine
for possession to $1,000 last year, with a $500 minimum.
   Legislative attempts to restore criminal penalties in Alaska
stalled in the Democratic-controlled House. Frustration over
lawmakers' resistance prompted a grassroots effort to take the
issue to voters.
   Alaskans for the Recriminalization of Marijuana gathered more
than 40,000 petition signatures - twice the number needed - to get
the measure on the ballot.
   The issue may also figure in the tight, three-way governor's
race.
   Democrat Tony Knowles, who has admitted smoking marijuana in the
early 1970s, said he favors restoring criminal penalties but
opposes sending first-time offenders to jail.
   He faces Republican Arliss Sturgulewski and Walter Hickel of the
Alaskan Independence Party in the general election. Both have
endorsed the anti-marijuana measure.
   If the measure passes, the change will be largely symbolic.
Police say catching adults using pot in their homes would be a low
priority.
   State law bans possession of marijuana in public, as well as
cultivation, transport and sale. Possession by juveniles also is
illegal.
   Nevertheless, proponents say the measure is needed to send a
clear message to Alaska's youth about the perils of drug abuse.
   ``The whole point is that our young people truly understand that
this is an illicit drug throughout the United States,'' said Marie
Majewske, chairwoman of Alaskans for the Recriminalization of
Marijuana. ``It doesn't change when it hits Alaska.''

   The Italian ready-to-wear designers are
predicting a hot and sexy season for the spring-summer 1991.
   The opening show of the five-day fashion parade, Dolce and
Gabbana, looked more a scene from a red-light district than a
runway.
   Sequined bras, bandanas and bustiers, black thigh stockings,
ultra-short skirts and shorts, long strings of pearls and gold
beads all combined to make the streetwalker a fashion plate.
   The two Sicilians Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana make no
bones about their body baring. ``Passion is what the collection is
all about,'' boast the two young and emerging designers.
   ``What we did was undress the body, to emphasize the best points
of the Mediterranean beauty, breasts, waist and hips.''
   The designers, however, were careful not to make the look too
aggressive, interspersing black negligee wear with ethereal white
chiffon tunics and demure poof skirts. White thigh stockings and
opera sleeves combined to place the Dolce and Gabbana woman
somewhere between the ballet school and the brothel.
   In any case there is no place for her in the office. A series of
white pant suits with ultra high waists and long duster jackets
were the only acceptable office apparel in the entire show.
   Giorgio Armani, the most popular Italian ready-to-wear designer,
who made his fame by making the mannish look fashionable, also
succumbs to passion for the Spring-Summer 1991.
   In his Emporio collection, for the younger set, shown here
Sunday, he emphasizes long legs in thigh-high mini skirts and
thigh-baring shorts, both worn with high-heeled sandals.
   But the Armani sex appeal is less blatant than the flamboyant
Dolce and Gabbana look, with lots of youthful and sporty
windbreakers for day and night to soften the message.
   Complice, who also showed Sunday, opted for a more citified look
in neat pant suits, trim skirts and classic jackets. However bras
are not a big item in the Complice collection, with bare breasts
under almost every blouse and jacket seen down the runway.
   Even staid and demure Laura Biagiotti could not resist the
temptations of the flesh, baring the body in her new collection
presented Sunday, with silk thread faggoting on long linen evening
gowns in ivory white.
   Thus the Biagiotti women, used to hiding her figure in ample
``bambola'' doll dresses, finds herself showing off her navel, hips
and thighs.
   Gianni Versace, whose sexy styles make him the golden boy of
Rodeo Drive, was also to present his version of the 1991 Italian
sex appeal. If other designers are predicting a hot summer,
Gianni's is sure to be torrid.

   Princess Anne presented actor Sean Connery an
award for his ``outstanding contribution to world cinema.''
   Connery, only the third recipient of the Silver Mask Tribute
Award, said he was ``very moved'' by the presentation Sunday.
   The previous winners of the British Academy of Film and
Television Artists award were Dirk Bogarde and Julie Andrews.
   ``This for me is certainly as important, if not more so, than
the Oscars because I don't live either here or in America these
days,'' said Scottish-born Connery, who lives in Marbella, Spain.
   Connery, 60, played James Bond in seven films until 1983 and is
still one of the world's top box office draws.
   He won the 1988 Oscar for best supporting actor in ``The
Untouchables.''
   This year he has starred in three major feature films: ``Family
Business'' with Dustin Hoffman, ``Hunt For Red October'' and ``The
Russia House'' with Michelle Pfeiffer.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Carrie Fisher says she took drugs while writing
her novel ``Postcards from the Edge'' in order to add reality to
the tale that chronicles the recovery of a drug-addicted actress.
   To create scenes of the male character relapsing into drug
abuse, Fisher had to relive the nightmare, she says in the November
issue of Premiere magazine.
   ``There's no way to do it well and not go through it somehow,''
she said about the drug use. ``I had to go through a thing of
starting and taking a little bit of drugs, and more, and more.''
   ``Postcards from the Edge'' was published in 1987. Fisher, who
starred in the ``Star Wars'' trilogy, also wrote the screenplay for
the film of the same name, which stars Meryl Streep as the
drug-addicted actress and Shirley MacLaine as her alcoholic mother.
   Fisher, 33, daughter of actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie
Fisher, said working on the film made her feel like some Hollywood
children ``who just exploit their parents' infinitely exploitable
existence.''

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Animal rights activists marched outside
actress Cybil Shepherd's future home to protest her work with a
cosmetics company they say tortures rabbits and mice during
laboratory testing.
   ``We want Ms. Shepherd to carry a message of compassion to the
people at L'Oreal, but she has even refused to answer our
letters,'' said director Kathy Snow Guillermo of the Caring
Consumer Campaign for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   Ms. Shepherd, who could not be reached for comment, was targeted
by about 75 protesters Saturday because she is a leading model for
the Paris-based L'Oreal.
   Jim Nixon, an executive vice president with Cosmair Inc.,
L'Oreal's U.S. distributor, said animal testing is done in rare
cases when a product could be toxic or dangerous to humans.
   Ms. Shepherd co-stars in the new movie ``Texasville'' and
starred in the television series ``Moonlighting.''

   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) - Adam Rich, who played the youngest
child in TV's ``Eight is Enough'' brood, was arrested for
investigation of drunken driving, authorities said.
   The actor was arrested Saturday after police spotted him making
an illegal U-turn and driving erratically along Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Lee Jordan said.
   Rich's blood alcohol level was tested at 0.18 percent, more than
twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent, Jordan said.
   He was cited and released Saturday. He must attend an Oct. 31
hearing at Beverly Hills Municipal Court to face the misdemeanor
count, Jordan said.
   Rich, who turns 22 Friday, was treated for a cocaine habit in
1988. At that time, his manager Jeff Ballard said the young actor
was ``determined to straighten out his life.''
   He is best known for his role on ``Eight is Enough,'' which ran
on ABC from 1977 to 1981.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Historian Shelby Foote, the principal
commentator in the PBS series ``The Civil War,'' recalls when he
was simply a secluded scholar who wrote by hand and went days with
no company other than his wife and daughter.
   Now the phone rings constantly in his Memphis, Tenn., home,
Foote told People magazine in its Oct. 15 issue.
   Thirty-six years after he published the three-volume ``The Civil
War: A Narrative,'' Foote suddenly is being sought by the media.
The books, now in their 18th printing, took him 20 years to write.
   ``I'm looking forward to when my 15 minutes of Andy Warhol fame
are over,'' he said. ``What I do requires steady work and isolation
from all this hoorah.'' ---
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - Actress Susan Dey, who has played a judge
and prosecutor as Grace Van Owen on ``L.A. Law,'' says her fifth
season on the NBC series will be her last.
   Dey, who was in Wichita Sunday as national spokeswoman for the
Institute of Logopedics for children with communication disorders,
said that she decided to leave the show after the upcoming season
because her contract expires.
   She said she was not leaving because of any ill feelings.
   ``It's harder to take the risk and not to stay,'' she said.
``I'm only (leaving) because the play has run a long run, and I
want to know who else is out there I can play.''
   ``It has enhanced this year for me, knowing that this is the
last time to play Grace,'' she said. ``It made Grace more exciting
to me.''
   Dey said future plans include making two movies through her own
production company, one of them about children.

<HEAD>Despite What Bush Says, Cops Say Drugs Still Biggest Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says America is making progress
in the war against drugs, but cops on the nation's streets say it's
still pretty bad out there and not getting any better.
   ``It's getting worse by leaps and bounds,'' said police Lt. Josh
Landers of Yonkers, N.Y., one of more than two dozen law
enforcement officials nationwide surveyed by The Associated Press.
``It's crazy.''
   ``We're dying out here,'' said narcotics Detective Margaret
Gagnon in Willimantic, Conn., a town of about 15,000. ``We're
inundated with drug dealers. Our neighborhoods are totally
destroyed.''
   ``Anyone who tells you we've turned the corner and we're winning
the war, that's hogwash,'' said a Miami-based Drug Enforcement
Administration agent who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush and national drug control policy director William J.
Bennett emphasized the positive during a Sept. 5 White House
session marking the first anniversary of the administration's drug
strategy.
   They pointed to a slight decrease in hospital emergency room
admissions for cocaine and heroin, attitudinal surveys showing
growing opposition to drug use, and signs that the supply of the
nation's most disruptive drug - cocaine - had been reduced,
reflected in higher prices and lower purity.
   The AP survey of cities from Miami to Yakima, Wash., found that
cocaine has indeed become more expensive and less pure in most
areas. When the DEA found similar changes during the summer, it
concluded there was a cocaine shortage that may be partly caused by
suppliers rigging the market to increase profits.
   ``What we're hearing on the streets is they say it's just dry
out there,'' said police Detective Daryl Higgins of Tacoma, Wash.
``They can't get nothing. A year ago, that was almost a
non-existent statement.''
   One city that exemplifies the changes is Brownsville, Texas, on
the Mexican border. Last September, a kilogram of cocaine cost
$14,000 to $15,000 and was 90 percent to 95 percent pure. This
fall, a kilo - 2.2 pounds - costs about $20,000, and the purity has
dropped to 60 percent to 65 percent, said Armando Ramirez, the DEA
agent in charge of the local office.
   Elsewhere in the country, the average price of a kilo of cocaine
shot up by more than 85 percent in Boston and Monroe, La. It rose
75 percent in New York City and 70 percent in Los Angeles, while
cities from Seattle to Concord, N.H., had less dramatic increases.
   The average wholesale price dropped in only three cities: It
plummeted 56 percent in Shreveport, La., and 17 percent in Denver
and Des Moines, Iowa.
   On the street, a gram of cocaine powder cost around $93 this
September, about 19 percent higher than last year, the survey
found.
   Despite such encouraging signs, many law enforcement officials
contacted said their cities were still ravaged by drugs and the
violence that attends the illicit dealing.
   ``It cuts across all demographic factors,'' said Glenn Levant,
deputy chief of police in Los Angeles who heads the bureau of
special investigations. ``It cuts across all walks of life.''
   Landers, who heads the narcotics unit in Yonkers, a city of
190,000 just north of New York City, agreed. ``It cuts through all
ethnic lines and is literally the basis for most crimes in the
city.''
   Cocaine and its smokeable derivative, crack, remain the primary
drug of concern to law enforcement officials - in part because of
the violence among dealers - but other drugs are gaining in
popularity, officers said.
   Heroin appears to be on the increase in such diverse areas as
New York City, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Mo., and Lowell, Mass.,
police say.
   Methamphetamine, known also as ``crank'' or ``speed,'' is
growing dramatically in Iowa, Montana, Missouri, Colorado and
Washington. Lt. Rodney Burk of Springfield, Mo., described
methamphetamine as ``kind of a poor man's cocaine'' that provides a
longer-lasting high and is readily available because it is made in
America.
   Marijuana, still the nation's most widely used illicit drug
despite the attention to paid to cocaine and crack, is showing up
in greater quantities in Dallas and Minneapolis, police say.
   And the psychedelic LSD, so popular in the late 1960s, is
gaining popularity in such places as Kansas City, Brockton, Mass.,
and Tacoma, Wash.
   Nevertheless, some officers are trying to look on the bright
side.
   ``As an optimist, I'd say it wasn't getting any worse,'' said
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police Detective Barry Margolis.
   Detective Arthur McClaren in Brockton, Mass., said, ``It's past
the epidemic stage.''
   ``I think we're making inroads,'' said Ramirez of the DEA's
Brownsville, Texas, office. ``I think we're hurting some people.
We've been able to catch people that before were untouchable. We've
been taking their property, their cash, their luxury items.''

   David Duke's strong showing in Louisiana's
weekend Senate primary election brought instant repudiation from
national GOP leaders who shunned the ex-Ku Klux Klan leader's
candidacy throughout his campaign.
   ``We have taken the unusual step of censuring Mr. Duke and as
far as the Republican Party is concerned, he does not exist,''
Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater said in a
telephone interview late Saturday.
   ``This is the first political action I've taken in many, many
moons,'' said Atwater, hospitalized in recent months for treatment
of a brain tumor. ``I can't think of a better way to spend my
political energy than denouncing David Duke and everything he
stands for.''
   ``He's a charlatan and a phony and he's looking to hang his
views on any mantle of legitimacy that he can find,'' national
committee spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said Sunday from Washington.
   Duke, a former Klan grand wizard, made it clear he has no
intention of disappearing from GOP politics. At a news conference
Sunday, he laughed off suggestions that he might again run for
president, as he did in 1988 as a Democrat and a Populist.
   The Republican state legislator said a run for governor of
Louisiana is more likely, and he predicted he will become a force
in national GOP policy.
   ``I want all my supporters who are Democrats or independent to
join in the Republican party because the Republican party is the
only choice we have in this country right now for the will of the
majority,'' he said.
   Duke drew 44 percent of the vote in Saturday's election despite
opponents' constant campaign focus on his past as a KKK leader with
ties to Nazi groups and his sale of Nazi literature even after
taking state legislative office last year.
   Goodman said Duke's unexpectedly high share of the vote could
have been a form of mass complaint from voters to the three-term
incumbent - Democrat J. Bennett Johnston.
   ``All Republicans hope (the) defeat was the end of Duke's
political career,'' Goodman said.
   Johnston, who won the election with 54 percent of ballots cast,
told consituents that he ``got the message'' from the more than
600,000 people who voted for Duke.
   Louisiana state Sen. Ben Bagert, a Republican who dropped out of
the race to help Johnston avoid a runoff with Duke, said Duke's
strong showing may only be the beginning of the mischief he can
make in GOP politics.
   Bagert accepted some of the blame for failing to get his message
across to voters, but said national party officials were slow to
react.
   ``Now, because of their error, timidness, the Republican party
has in David Duke, the same destructive force that Jesse Jackson
has brought to the Democrats,'' said Bagert.
   Television ads by President Bush weren't broadcast until late in
the campaign because of Bagert's poor finances. He dropped out of
the race Thursday, saying his internal polls showed he was drawing
just enough late support from Johnston to risk putting Duke in a
runoff.
   By the time he got out, the party was already abandoning Bagert.
On Wednesday, eight Republican senators endorsed Johnston.
   Bagert said the GOP ``abandoned the battlefield'' to Duke.
   On Sunday Duke accused Washington Republicans of betraying the
party by endorsing Johnston. He repeated major campaign themes,
calling for an end to race-based affirmative action programs, no
new taxes and welfare reform.
   ``I think it's time that we make sure the Republican party does
not continue it's drift to the left,'' he said.

<HEAD>Timidity May Do In Richards; Verbal Gaffes Could Be Williams'
Downfall</HEAD>

   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann
Richards is struggling to gain ground on folksy GOP rancher-oilman
Clayton Williams, and analysts blame her fuzzy campaign theme and
early neglect of core Democratic values.
   In a campaign notable for the candidates' negative attacks on
each other, Richards seems to be trying to out-Republican Williams
on issues such as crime, analysts say.
   ``I think she wasted too much time trying to emphasize campaign
issues that are really his agenda,'' said Jerry Polinard, a
University of Texas-Pan American political scientist.
   ``If he was managing her campaign, he couldn't do any better.
He's had her running on his issues - and she's not been talking
about anything that makes him uncomfortable,'' said Polinard.
   Most opinion polls put Williams ahead by eight to 12 percentage
points. Williams promises to double the number of prison cells and
introduce youthful offenders to ``the joys of bustin' rocks.'' He
opposes gun control and objects to abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and danger to a mother's life.
   Richards' ``New Texas'' campaign theme is too vague, analysts
say. But in recent days, she has turned her attention to more
traditional Democratic issues such as soaring health insurance
costs.
   Richards must emphasize environment, education, insurance reform
and hit ``on the simple point that she's on `our' side'' and he's
this rich guy who's on `their' side,'' said East Texas State
University political scientist Charles Elliott.
   Williams is a multimillionaire who has ``been able and more
willing to try to identify himself with some traditional Texas
myths,'' says Elliott.
   He is never without his cowboy hat and often appears on
horseback in his television commercials, which have cost his
campaign a fortune. His biggest problem seems to be that he keeps
putting his foot in his mouth.
   Williams recently said he hoped Richards, a 10-year recovering
alcoholic, wasn't ``drinking again'' when she said new polls would
show her gaining ground fast.
   In March, Williams was forced to apologize for likening bad
weather to rape and advising that if it were inevitable, ``relax
and enjoy it.''
   He then admitted visiting prostitutes as a youth, saying that
was how young men got ``serviced.''
   He said he was uncomfortable running against a woman. He said he
opposed gun control laws because citizens ``might have to march on
the government'' someday. And, he said he would ``head and hoof''
Richards like a calf and ``drag her through the dirt.''
   ``People think this guy's a hoof-in-mouth millionaire,'' said Ed
Martin, executive director of the state Democratic Party. ``It's
making a lot of people have second thoughts.''
   Williams spent more than $8 million in the GOP primary and has
spent $2 million on TV commercials since the primary election.
   ``Clearly, he's got more TV exposure. He's got more money to
work with. He's been on the tube more and longer than she's been,''
Elliott said.
   Richards has a chance if the next round of polls show Williams'
lead slipping to less than 10 points, says Polinard, but she'll
have to change her tactics.
   ``It seems that every Democratic candidate has a chapter in
their campaign books, right at the end, that says: `If in a panic,
open this chapter.' And there it says - populism,'' said Polinard.
   Elliott said Richards' recent commercial on health insurance
costs has hit home.
   She also needs to highlight her support for abortion, he said.
Williams has made his anti-abortion stance very clear and Richards
``needs to pound on that,'' said Elliott.
   ``It's an issue that will allow her to penetrate those yuppie
suburbs in Dallas and Houston more than almost any single issue,''
Elliott said.

<DATELINE>HINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To help ease the pain, soldiers' children
in Liberty County have covered school bulletin boards with
snapshots of their parents. Usually, mom or dad is pictured in
Army-issue desert tan.
   The children are afraid, wondering what life is like for the
fathers and mothers who make up the ``desert shield'' in Saudi
Arabia, and about who will shield the families they left behind in
eastern Georgia.
   The upheaval caused by the deployment of 14,000 soldiers from
nearby Fort Stewart to the Middle East prompted Hinesville Middle
School to form support groups for students.
   ``They're awfully worried. They're worried they might not come
back. They're worried they're not getting enough water,'' said
Debbie Clifton, a counselor who supervises one of the peer support
groups. Her husband, William, is an Army captain in Saudi Arabia.
   Students at a recent session said the deployment disrupted their
lives.
   ``It gets lonely in the house sometimes,'' said Melissa Rowan,
14, daughter of Sgt. 1st Class John Rowan. ``It gets scary at night
because there's no one to protect us. I just want to let him know
that I love him and we want him home.''
   Elizabeth Tezza, 12, said her family put new locks on the doors
after her father, Maj. Robert J. Tezza, shipped out.
   ``We write him letters almost every night,'' she said. ``It's
real hot over there. He might get sunstroke or he might get hurt.''
   Christina Spankel, 13, daughter of Sgt. 1st Class William T.
Spankel, said she hopes the crisis can be settled peacefully.
   ``My mom worries a lot,'' she said. ``It's really scary at
night.''
   Counselors said some children resent the departure of their
parents; some misbehave and neglect their studies; and some worry
about family finances, poison gas and the availability of water in
the desert.
   Mrs. Clifton said teachers and counselors try to dispel rumors
and give the children a realistic view of the situation. They try
to help students understand the grief process and reassure them
that the sadness will pass.
   She and another counselor, Marjory Varnedoe, began meeting with
the two support groups last month during lunch breaks. Similar
programs are being considered at other schools serving military
children in the Hinesville area.
   About 8,000 students, many of them military dependents, are
enrolled in the Liberty County School System. An additional 1,655
attend two federally financed elementary schools at Fort Stewart.
   Virginia Schubert, a counselor at Lyman Hall Elementary School,
said some Army spouses visit the school to discuss their children
and find it a safe place to talk about their own anxieties.
   Mrs. Schubert, whose husband is a chemical warfare officer in
Saudi Arabia, said teachers encourage children to write their
missing parents and tack their photos on bulletin boards.
   Gena Churchwell, a special education teacher at Diamond
Elementary School, said some children have responded to the
deployment by misbehaving and others have become withdrawn.
   Linda Flora, a fourth grade teacher at Brittin Elementary
School, said teachers discuss Operation Desert Shield, the Persian
Gulf region and encourage students to talk about their feelings.
   She said one boy, fearing he would become a poison gas victim,
stared at an open window at night and could not sleep. Another was
thrilled when his father sent him a plastic bag of sand.
   Many of the teachers wear red, white and blue ribbons to show
their support for the soldiers. Each class has adopted an Army unit
and students are encouraged to write the soldiers in that unit.
   School helps children stay occupied as they deal with their
fears and loneliness, Flora said.
   ``I think a lot of them are realizing that even if dad is away,
they still have school work,'' the teacher said. ``Mom or dad might
be gone, but the school is still here.''

<HEAD>Playing Up Iraq's Weapons to Preserve Star Wars Funding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stalwart congressional defenders of the
Strategic Defense Initiative are relying on the menace of Iraq's
arsenal to renew interest in the beleaguered space-based defense
program.
   ``Nuclear and chemical warheads are with us. Yesterday they
might have been used by the Soviet Union. Today they might be used
by Iraq,'' Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said during House debate on SDI
and the 1991 military bill.
   As the Cold War thawed and defense budgets shrank, Congress
began to snip away at the program popularly known as Star Wars.
   The so-called missile shield was six years old when Congress
first trimmed its budget last year. This summer, the Senate again
dropped an ax on the program, cleaving $1 billion from the $4.7
billion that President Bush had sought for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1.
   The same week, the House Armed Services Committee slashed $1.8
billion from Bush's SDI budget proposal. And last month, the full
House further reduced the SDI budget, approving $2.3 billion for
the program in fiscal 1991.
   With members of the House and Senate meeting in a closed-door
conference to craft a final version of the defense budget, a
compromise SDI total of about $3 billion or less appears likely.
   These reductions are being discussed and approved as U.S. troops
and equipment continue to pour into Saudi Arabia following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Campaigning to save the program from deeper cuts, SDI backers
contend the Soviet Union still poses a theat. They argue that SDI
is key to future arms control agreements.
   The overriding rationale presented during congressional debate
and recent interviews is the weapons capability being developed by
Iraq and other Third World nations.
   ``The pace of weapons of mass destruction proliferation is truly
a frightening process,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview.
   Lawmakers point to statements by CIA Director William Webster
earlier this year in which he told Congress that by the end of the
decade, more than 15 Third World countries will be capable of
launching ballistic missiles and about six will have nuclear
missiles.
   In testimony on Wednesday, Paul Wolfowitz, under secretary of
defense for policy, said Iraq's capability of deploying its current
missiles, including its improved SCUD, the al-Hussein, is ``well
over the 500-kilometer range.''
   ``The range steadily increases. It's only a matter of time''
until they develop an intercontinental ballistic missile, Wolfowitz
said.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, noted that Iraq has sent some type of missile into space
while China continues to experiment.
   ``It's naive to suppose that neither ourselves nor our allies
will be threatened in relatively short order,'' the Wyoming
Republican said in an interview Wednesday. ``Why should we expose
our people to terrorists when we have the ability to stop them.''
   Wallop believes the major reason for the program is the Soviet
Union, which still possesses about 30,000 nuclear weapons and last
year produced 140 new ICBMs for a total of 1,400.
   In addition, the Soviet Union made more than 40 strategic
bombers last year while the United States manufactured one B-2
stealth bomber.
   ``They continue to build these things,'' said Wallop, who
wonders what will happen if Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
is ousted. ``Mortals change their minds or are replaced by mortals
of a different mind.''

<TEXT>
   Singer Randy Travis gets another shot
tonight at one of the few awards he's never won - the Country Music
Association's entertainer of the year.
   He's sold more than 10 million records and has been a finalist
for the award three times, but the CMA's top honor has eluded him.
   The award is among a dozen to be announced tonight at the Grand
Ole Opry House during the 24th annual CMA awards show broadcast
live by CBS, starting at 9 p.m. EDT.
   Travis' main competition for entertainer of the year is expected
to be the 1989 winner, George Strait, who latest hit, ``Love
Without End, Amen,'' is one of the biggest of his career.
   Other finalist nominees are Clint Black, Kathy Mattea and Ricky
Van Shelton.
   Travis said if he doesn't win, he won't be disappointed.
   ``I've been fortunate to win what I have,'' he said. ``I've had
plenty. You wouldn't be much of a person if you'd won as much as I
have and then get mad about not winning again.''
   Travis has more than 40 country music awards and was voted CMA's
male vocalist of the year in 1987 and 1988. He won Grammy awards in
1988 and 1989.
   If he isn't chosen top entertainer, he won't be the only country
music superstar without the honor. Kenny Rogers has never won it
either.
   Surprisingly, Travis was not voted a finalist this year for male
vocalist of the year. Those are Black, Garth Brooks, Rodney
Crowell, Shelton and Strait. Shelton won a year ago.
   Finalists for No. 1 female vocalist are Patty Loveless, Mattea,
Reba McEntire, Lorrie Morgan and Tanya Tucker. Mattea is the
reigning singer.
   Finalists for top album are Alan Jackson for ``Here in the Real
World,'' the late Keith Whitley for ``I Wonder Do You Think of
Me,'' Strait for ``Livin' It Up,'' the Kentucky HeadHunters for
``Pickin' on Nashville'' and Shelton for ``RVS III.''
   For single of the year, finalists are Jackson for ``Here in the
Real World,'' Brooks for ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' Black for
``Killin' Time,'' Vince Gill for ``When I Call Your Name'' and
Mattea for ``Where've You Been.''
   McEntire and Travis will be co-hosts of the nationally televised
show.

<HEAD>Study: Nearly 43,000 Entered State, Federal Prisons by Midyear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The population of state and federal prisons
rose by 80,000 from June 1989 to June 1990 - the largest growth in
65 years of record keeping, the Justice Department says.
   The nation's prisoner population reached a record 755,425 as the
numberoof inmates jumped 42,862 during the first half of 1990, said
a Bureau of Justice Statistics study of state and federal prison
populations.
   The 6 percent increase during the six-month period was only
slightly less than the record 46,000 jump during the first half of
1989, said the study released Sunday.
   It helped pace a record annual increase of 80,000 prisoners from
June 1989 to June of this year that Stephen D. Dillingham, the
bureau's director, called ``the largest growth in 65 years of
prison population statistics.''
   The already overcrowded federal prison population grew by 8
percent during the first six months of the year while the number of
state prison inmates increased 5.8 percent, the study said.
   Federal prisons hold nearly 60,000 inmates. The enactment of
mandatory minimum sentences, particularly for drug crimes and
repeat offenders, have helped swell the ranks of federal prisons.
   The prison population growth created a weekly demand of 1,650
new beds for inmates, the study found.
   The growth in the number of women prisoners continued to out
pace the increase in male inmates, the study said.
   The number of women prisoners jumped 7.1 percent during the
six-month period, compared to a 5.9 percent increase in the male
inmates.
   At midyear, there were 43,541 women and 711,884 men in state or
federal prisons.
   Illinois posted a 10.5 percent increase in its prison
population, the largest percentage increase of the 50 states,
followed by New Hampshire's increase of 10.3 percent.
   Prison populations declined in seven states - Alaska, Colorado,
New Mexico, Rhode Island, Oregon, Tennessee and West Virginia, the
study said.
   Nationwide, the incarceration rate was 289 people held in state
and federal prisons per 100,000 U.S. residents.
   The South had the highest rate: 310 prisoners per 100,000
residents. In the West it was 271 prisoners per 100,000 residents,
followed by rates of 238 per 100,000 in the Midwest and 231 per
100,000 in the Northeast.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo fired his
defense minister and the powerful chief of military intelligence
today, blaming them in a scandal involving charges the government
spied on more than 1,300 civilians.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung - one alleged target of the
espionage - joined student protesters in calling for the
intelligence unit's dissolution.
   Dissidents said the scandal proves the ``undemocratic nature''
of Roh's government.
   Charges in the past week of military surveillance of civilians,
including leading politicians, have eroded government claims that
the military is politically neutral and no longer a figure in
politics.
   Presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said Roh was holding the two
fired officials responsible in the scandal. He said the government
would enact reforms ``to meet with circumstances befitting the new
era'' - but did not elaborate.
   Roh moved quickly in an effort to diminish the impact of the
scandal. It threatened to seriously jolt his government just as
opposition politicians have boycotted the National Assembly
demanding broader democratic reforms.
   In August, all 78 opposition members of parliament resigned en
masse, accusing Roh of railroading bills and ignoring demands for
reforms.
   Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon was being replaced immediately by
former Army Chief of Staff Lee Jong-koo, 57. Lt. Gen. Koo Chang-hoe
is new commander of the Defense Security Command, the military
intelligence unit, replacing Lt. Gen. Cho Nam-pung, the president's
office said.
   The new defense minister once headed the Defense Security
Command under disgraced former president Chun Doo-hwan. Chun has
been in self-imposed rural exile to take responsibility for
corruption during his seven-year rule, which ended in 1988 after
massive student-led street protests.
   Kim Dae-jung, who heads the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy and had been imprisoned for political activity during
Chun's rule, said today that he would go on a hunger strike until
the command is dissolved.
   ``The military's meddling in politics aims at wiping out the
democratic forces,'' he told a news conference.
   About 25 students shouting anti-government slogans staged a
sit-down protest today at the Defense Security Command headquarters
near the U.S. 8th Army Base in central Seoul. All were taken away
by riot police.
   About 50 students staged a one-hour protest outside Seoul
National University to demand the command be disbanded. Wallposters
demanding an end to political surveillance appeared on the campuses
of at least six universities.
   Newspapers published reports saying military intelligence agents
had in the past received passes to drive onto some campuses and
operated off-campus coffee houses, masquerading as waiters.
   About 100 dissidents, representing 20 leading anti-government
groups, issued a joint statement today saying the political
surveillance ``proves the immorality and undemocratic nature of the
present regime.''
   The fired defense minister appeared to try to shed blame for the
scandal by suggesting he had been powerless to control the
intelligence unit. He told reporters the system should be changed
to give the minister complete control over military intelligence.
   Politicians, citizens groups, lawyers and dissidents reacted in
outrage last week after a deserter, 24-year-old army Pvt. Yoon
Suk-yang, disclosed the alleged surveillance of civilians in this
nation of 42.5 million people.
   Roh's political foes demanded that he apologize publicly, that
the command be dissolved, and that measures be spelled out to
prevent further surveillance.
   Yoon deserted from the military intelligence operation on Sept.
23, taking with him confidential papers, computer discs and data he
said were evidence of massive and organized illegal spying on
civilians.
   He provided data that included the names and personal records of
governing party chairman Kim Young-sam; Kim Dae-jung, and 89 other
lawmakers as well as hundreds of dissidents, clergy and
journalists.
   The Defense Ministry said Saturday it kept the information not
for political surveillance but to ``protect or cut off those listed
from enemies or impure elements.''
   Roh promised to maintain the military's political neutrality
after taking office in 1988.
   He took control of two thirds of the 299 National Assembly seats
in January by merging his party with two conservative opposition
groups.

<HEAD>Chess Championship Pits Brilliant Daring Against Surgical
Precision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first World Chess Championship to be held in
the United States in more than 80 years starts today with two
highly different Soviets competing in a battle of youthful daring
against mature surgical precision.
   The two-month tourney of mental fireworks pits defending world
champion Garry Kasparov against challenger and former champion
Anatoly Karpov.
   Kasparov and Karpov played their first match six years ago.
About 130 games later, the two chess wizards remain arch rivals who
command the board with expertise bordering on genius.
   Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess,
is known for a gambling, attacking style. Karpov, 39, counters with
methodical, precise strategies.
   Kasparov is only two points ahead of his challenger and the
difference in their temperaments, looks, politics and playing
styles has heightened interest in the competition between the
world's two best chess players.
   And it's no secret that they don't get along.
   When asked recently how they felt about each other, Kasparov
replied, ``Do the Yankees like the Red Sox?''
   Kasparov is talkative, flamboyant and fluent in English - a
media darling who tirelessly promotes chess. Fans in Europe squeal
at the mere sight of the dark-haired champion.
   He has launched an anti-communist newspaper, Democratic Russia,
in Moscow and is the founder of a democratic political party.
   During the match, Kasparov says he will play under the flag of
the Russian republic - not the Soviet Union, which he has said
``represents oppression and tyranny.''
   The fair-haired Karpov is introverted and uses an interpreter,
but he has been known to interject English words at news
conferences.
   The older chessman, a member of the Communist Party, says he
will play this match under the Soviet flag. He has been quoted as
saying, ``I have two loves: communism and chess.''
   Their chess styles match their temperaments. Kasparov gambles
and goes for the jugular at the slightest hint of weakness from his
opponent. He doesn't worry about sacrificing pieces in the attack.
   Karpov plays with surgical precision resembling the style of a
baseline tennis player; he wins by making fewer mistakes.
   Kasparov wrested the world championship from Karpov in 1985,
ending his 10-year reign. The younger man defended his title
against Karpov in 1986. In 1987, their championship match ended in
a tie; under the rules, Kasparov retained his title.
   This year's match will comprise 12 games in New York, three
times a week through Nov. 10, and 12 games in Lyons, France,
starting Nov. 24.
   The $3 million championship is being staged in the theater of a
midtown Manhattan hotel. It is the first world championship in the
United States since 1907.
   The winner will receive $1.7 million and the loser $1.3 million.
   Kasparov has said his earnings will fund ``my private interests
and the political interest of the world.'' Karpov has said he will
help victims of the Chernobyl nuclear plant fire and promote chess
in schools.
   Since World War II, seven of the world chess champions have come
from the Soviet Union. The only champion to break the Soviet
winning streak was American Bobby Fischer.

<HEAD>For The First Time, A Fence Built To Surround Governing Party
Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarmed by past terrorist attacks,
authorities have erected a six-foot-high spiked wire fence in the
seaside resort where Britain's governing Conservatives opens their
annual conference Tuesday.
   The three-mile-long fence in the south coast town of Bournemouth
is the first of its kind ever put up to protect a political
conference in Britain.
   It surrounds the Bournemouth International Center, where the
representatives meet, and the Highcliff Hotel, where leading party
members are staying.
   Bournemouth officials said nearly 1,500 police are on duty in an
unprecedented security operation costing nearly $3.7 million.
Independent Television News reported that Bournemouth councilors
hope that someone will help the town pay the bill.
   The fence is to protect the Conservatives from the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Irerland.
   During the Conservatives' 1984 party conference in Brighton on
the south coast, an IRA bomb blew up the hotel where Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher was staying. She escaped but five other people
were killed and 31 injured.
   Ian Gow, a Conservative lawmaker and personal friend of Mrs.
Thatcher, was murdered July 30 by the explosion of an IRA bomb
under his car.
   On Sept. 27, a sound engineer found a lunch box packed with
plastic explosive under a reading desk in a London club, timed to
go off half an hour after the start of a conference about
terrorism. The room had earlier been searched by police with dogs
and given the all clear.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for that one, too.

   Speaking at a rally for marijuana
legalization, a Kansas City mayoral candidate called for an end to
the war on drugs.
   ``If folks want to get high, get drunk, get stoned, get peaceful
or get fat, let's let them,'' said Richard C. Tolbert. ``After all,
isn't this still America?''
   The rally Sunday at Liberty Memorial drew about of 500 people
was part of the national ``Hemp Tour '90,'' staged to spread
information on the possible benefits of legalization and commercial
harvest of marijuana.
   Tolbert told the crowd society has learned to live in relative
peace with one of the most harmful drugs of all - alcohol.
   ``Why not regulate all of these drugs the same way we do alcohol
and allow them to be sold in liquor stores?'' he said. ``Yes, of
course, we should keep them out of the hands of minor children. We
should not sell beer or crack cocaine in vending machines, and we
probably should not sell tobacco that way, either.
   ``Whether your drug of choice is alcohol, crack cocaine,
tobacco, marijuana, Valium, heroin, chocolate, designer drugs or my
personal favorite, sugar, we should be willing to live and let
live,'' the former Kansas City councilman said.
   Tolbert called the war on drugs a waste of time and said society
instead should fight crimes where there is a suffering victim, such
as theft and rape.

<HEAD>Christian Prison Inmates Build House for Needy Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when many residents are rallying
against housing prisoners in their neighborhoods, a Houston church
congregation opened its homes to four federal prisoners armed with
hammers and nails.
   ``I was scared to death,'' said Matthew Criswell, construction
manager for Houston Habitat for Humanity, which helps provide homes
for poor people.
   ``When I got the word they were sending us four prisoners, I
automatically started asking questions: `Are we going to have to
keep an armed guard here? Are they going to do what I say? Am I
going to have to keep them away from telephones?'
   ``Now I just wish they were back, doing more work,'' he said.
   Last week, three convicted drug dealers and an income tax evader
- all members of a Christian prison program - helped build a
four-bedroom house for a needy family in an impoverished Houston
neighborhood.
   The prisoners didn't get special privilges or time off their
sentences for the work, but it didn't matter to inmate Calvin
Edwards, 33, who said he was working for the Lord.
   ``It's been a blessing for me to be out helping people,'' he
said.
   The effort was co-sponsored by Houston Habitat Humanity and
Prison Fellowship-Houston.
   The latter is a part of Prison Fellowship USA, founded in 1976
by Charles Colson, a Nixon administration aide sentenced to prison
for his role in the Watergate scandal.
   Under the program, volunteers approved by their prison's warden
and chaplain are allowed to take hammers and saws into the
community to help others.
   This is the third year the program has operated in Houston.
   ``They do construction or renovation for needy families that
couldn't be met through conventional financing,'' said Don Beard of
Crossroads Baptist Church, which found homes for the inmates during
their week of construction work in Houston. Other churches provided
lunches.
   ``They stayed with these families ... showed up every night for
Bible study and then they went to the job site between 8:30 a.m.
and nightfall,'' said Beard, himself a former inmate convicted of
embezzlement.
   ``They were just an inspiration to me,'' Criswell said. ``Just
the fact that they have decided to turn their lives around and do
what's right and help other people.''
   ``That's why we're doing this,'' said Bruce Daniel, 49, a
federal prisoner serving time in Texarkana. ``We're helping others
while serving the Lord.''

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Refugee: Iraqi Executions Have Silenced Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly arrived Kuwaiti refugee says
resistance to Iraqi forces virtually ended in his homeland after
the occupiers began executing suspected resistance members,
sometimes in front of their families.
   The former Health Ministry employee, Issa el-Nasrallah, said the
Iraqis are forcing out Kuwaitis to ``isolate the resistance.''
   His charges came as several hundred more Kuwaiti refugees
arrived Sunday at the Khafji border crossing in neighboring Saudi
Arabia. Iraq had again relaxed restrictions on departing Kuwaitis.
   Exiled Kuwaiti officials say Iraq is trying to chase away
Kuwaitis and repopulate the oil-rich land with Palestinians and
Iraqis.
   Nasrallah, who fled with his wife and four children, said many
people in occupied Kuwait believe Iraq is preparing for combat
there soon - presumably expecting to do battle with the U.S.-led
multinational force massed against it in Saudi Arabia.
   ``They also want to isolate the resistance to have everyone but
them leave. They're trying to force people out,'' said Nasrallah.
   He said acts of resistance had stopped in Kuwait City since the
Iraqis began killing anyone suspected of belonging to the
resistance, many in front of their families.
   ``Everybody's scared there. They don't know when the Iraqis will
come in the house and kill them,'' said Yusuf al-Ali, 25, a Kuwaiti
Airways pilot who also arrived during the weekend.
   Several hundred Westerners are still believed to be hiding in
Kuwait, fearful of being taken to Iraq for use as human shields at
military and other strategic installations.
   Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2 in a dispute over land and oil,
annexed the emirate and declared it an Iraqi province.
   Later in August, Kuwaiti refugees reported that resistance
fighters were staging desperate and daring attacks, including
suicide bombings. At that time, they said Iraq had been unable to
wipe them out.
   Exiled Kuwaitis have directed the resistance from a forward
command post in Khafji, three miles south of the border. They had
been smuggling in ammunition and communications equipment to help
fighters inside Kuwait.
   In early September, a senior guerrilla leader said the
resistance had recruited thousands of volunteers from among Kuwaiti
refugees in Saudi Arabia. At that time, a senior Saudi official
said the resistance was growing in strength and stepping up attacks
on the Iraqi occupiers. The latest opening of the border came
Friday after Iraqi authorities intensified night searches in Kuwait
City, refugees said. The searches prompted many of them to leave
out of fear.
   Iraqi troops were confiscating all identification papers in
Kuwait, the refugees reported.
   They said Iraqi authorities had announced that everyone must
hold identification cards issued in Baghdad, effectively making
them all into Iraqi citizens.
   Those arriving said Iraqi troops at the border were seizing some
men under age 40 and taking bribes to allow others to cross.
Refugees claim young men are being sent back for Iraqi military
service.
   The new opening of the border raised Saudi fears the Iraqis are
planning attempts to infiltrate agents into the kingdom.
   The new refugee influx is the largest since mid-September, when
7,000 Kuwaitis poured through over three days. In the new crush,
more than 1,000 refugees have arrived since Friday.
   An estimated 300,000 Kuwaiti refugees are in Saudi Arabia and
neighboring Persian Gulf states. Before the invasion, Kuwait had a
native population of about 600,000.

<HEAD>Juvenile Crime Needs Stricter Punishments, Police Chiefs Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma City police Chief Dave McBride says
coddling juvenile offenders just leads to more adult criminals.
   McBride, speaking at the 97th International Association of
Chiefs of Police Convention, criticized some parents and said the
courts' handling of juveniles is ``the biggest failure of the
justice system.''
   ``There's almost no such thing as a first-time (adult)
offender,'' McBride said. ``Most of the adults in prison were
handled a half-dozen times as juveniles.''
   McBride and more than 7,000 other police chiefs from around the
world have gathered in Tulsa for the convention. Chiefs from Japan,
the Philippines and Germany also are scheduled to attend the
six-day meeting, which began Sunday.
   McBride said he doesn't have all the solutions to juvenile
crime, but believes a starting point is at home.
   ``There are more parental delinquents than there are juvenile
delinquents,'' he said. ``Too many parents send their kids to
school to learn morality. They don't have any guidance at home.''
   Kansas City, Kan., police Chief Tom Dailey said more and more
juveniles are getting into trouble in his city, especially young
car thieves and youth gang members. He said vehicle thefts jumped
by 1,000 this year in his city, compared to 1989.
   ``We've got the same thing here,'' said Perry Anderson, chief of
police in Miami, Fla. ``They're active in auto thefts and burglary.
We arrest them, then they're right back on the streets again.
   ``We just don't have the space to house them.''
   Juvenile thieves are the least of Chicago's worries, with more
serious offenders occupying officers' time, said police Detective
Lt. Howard Allen of Chicago's youth section.
   ``They probably wouldn't even get into a secure facility,'' he
said. ``Maybe if they had eight to 10 charges against them and the
facility wasn't full, but usually not.''
   Most of the youths who go to jail or prison are charged with
violent crimes like robbery, arson and rape, Allen said.
   Chuck Gruber, president of the police chiefs group, said the
conference is the best chance for police from around the world to
compare notes and share techniques.
   ``It's a learning process for police chiefs, sharing information
and hopefully coming away better prepared to do our jobs,'' said
Gruber, who is chief in Elgin, Ill.
   Delegates will discuss crime issues common to almost every part
of the world, ranging from traffic tickets to hate crimes and
international money laundering, he said.

<HEAD>With PM-Police Chiefs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 50 people shot by Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies since 1985 may have been unarmed, and
most of the victims were members of minority groups, a newspaper
reported.
   Sheriff's deputies have been involved in 56 questionable
shootings in the last five years in which 26 people were killed.
None of the victims fired a weapon, the Los Angeles Daily News
reported Sunday.
   Just four of the shootings involved undisputed evidence that the
victim had some type of weapon in hand when deputies fired - the
weapons were a knife, a push broom brush head, a sauce pan and a
metal pipe, according to the report.
   In the other cases, there was conflicting evidence over whether
the victims possessed any weapon, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper study, which examined the department's 202
shootings since 1985, relied on the sheriff's own investigation
reports, called ``shooting books.'' Eighty-percent of the 56
disputed cases involved members of minority groups, department
records showed.
   Sheriff Sherman Block defended his department's record, saying
deputies are faced with rising crime in minority neighborhoods
where the ``perception'' of danger often leads them into situations
where shooting is justified.
   ``There is bound to be a higher level of violent confrontation
between law enforcement and those people,'' Block said.
   The department has refused to disclose how many deputies were
disciplined in the shootings or identify them, the newspaper said.
   Last month, a civil rights lawsuit was filed against the
sheriff's department on behalf of 75 people who allegedly were
victims of brutality or racial harassment by deputies at a
sheriff's station in the city of Lynwood. Block said the department
is conducting an internal investigation into brutality questions.

<HEAD>Britain's `Desert Rats' Under U.S. Marine Command</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The soldiers of Britain's 7th
armored brigade - the ``Desert Rats'' of North Africa fame - have
been assigned to U.S. Marine control in an unusual pairing in the
Persian Gulf multinational forces.
   Officials say that in the event of war, the 7,000 British troops
would fight as an integral unit of the 4th Marine Expeditionary
Brigade, relying on Marine air support and using NATO-type
communications gear.
   Both sides appear to welcome the teaming despite their
contrasting skills.
   The 33,000 Marines, trained primarily as an amphibious assault
force using helicopters and landing craft, have been in the Saudi
sand for six weeks.
   The 7th Brigade, despite its desert legacy, has spent much of
the last 40 years in the green fields of western Europe.
   The British brigade's two regiments recently spent some time
training in hot, dry terrain in Canada, but conditions there hardly
compare with what the British will find in the Saudi desert, with
its extreme heat and equipment-ravaging sand.
   Advance parties of the brigade are already in Saudi Arabia and
Royal Engineers are building a tent city, located close to the
Marine base, to be ready when the main force begins to arrive by
air on Oct. 16.
   The unit's equipment, including 120 advanced-design Challenger
tanks, will be sent aboard 31 chartered ships, British officials
say.
   The Challengers, fitted with 120mm main guns and what British
experts call the world's best armor, are ``superior to anything the
Iraqis have,'' British Armed Forces Minister Archibald Hamilton
said during a vist on Saturday.
   Hamilton, the second-ranking official in Britain's Defense
Ministry, told reporters that the idea of putting the 7th Brigade
under Marine operational control originated with the Americans as a
way of ``enhancing the capability of the Marines.''
   ``We welcome it,'' agreed a Marine officer who asked not to be
named. ``Everybody will keep their national identity, but
tactically the Brits will be just another maneuver element in our
force.''
   U.S. officers say the Marines will furnish the air cover for the
7th Brigade as well as their own troops. The British will be
responsible for their own logistics, resupply and transportation.

   City efforts to improve race relations by
increasing the number of black police officers instead have
generated ill-feelings among whites and blacks alike.
   Whites are angry that black candidates for police training
didn't have to score as high as white applicants on the entrance
exam. Also vexed were members of the Denver Black Police Officers
Association.
   ``Blacks as much as any others want to make sure that standards
are not lowered,'' said Kirk L. Dunham, president of the black
officers association. ``Our lives are on the line because we do the
same jobs as white and Hispanic officers. We want competent,
qualified black officers.''
   The complaints arose after all 96 black applicants who passed an
entrance test in July were accepted for further testing, while only
89 of 636 whites were accepted and 15 of 160 Hispanics advanced.
   Although all those accepted scored passing grades, some of the
blacks accepted scored lower than some of the rejected whites. The
200 people who passed the first hurdle are competing for only 40
slots in the police academy class that begins Nov. 1.
   The city's Civil Service Commission is operating under a court
decree that requires 45 percent of three upcoming police academy
classes to be black. The quota resulted from an agreement between
the city and the police union.
   Blacks make up only 6 percent of the 1,331-member police force.
Seventy-seven percent of the officers are white, the rest are
Hispanic or other minorities. Blacks account for 12 percent of the
city's population.
   City officials also were concerned by the high failure rate of
blacks on the written, physical and psychological portions of the
July test. Of the 194 blacks who took the test, 49.5 percent
passed, while 79.5 percent of the whites passed and 58.8 percent of
the Hispanics passed.
   The city hired Dr. David Morris, president of the Morris and
McDaniel consulting firm of Washington, D.C., to review the tests
for any cultural biases.
   Morris said he found none, but he did cite problems with the
city's minority recruiting program.
   In one instance, recruiters pursued randm candidates at a
shopping mall, he said. In another instance, they recruited blacks
who couldn't read and tried to teach them to read.
   ``That's like sending a baseball coach or a football coach to a
mall to recruit athletes, just because they're black,'' Morris
said. ``It was a waste of their time and the taxpayers' money.''
   He said the city needs to begin recruiting minorities in high
school, find the ones with an aptitude for police work and support
them through school and the academy, financially and academically.
   ``If the city would do that, it wouldn't need an affirmative
action program,'' he said. ``In three or four years, the problem
would take care of itself.''
   White candidates also were angered because the city set up a
tutoring program to help blacks pass the test. Morris said whites
also received tutoring, but not as much as blacks.
   Jim Belknap, clerical services supervisor for the Civil Service
Commission, stressed that the city did not lower its standards for
black applicants and that all who were accepted made a passing
grade.
   ``You're still talking about B-minus or C-plus students,'' he
said.
   John Wyckoff, a spokesman for the police department, said he
received just five complaints from citizens concerned the city was
hiring less than qualified police officers.
   ``We're not compromising our position,'' he said. ``They still
have to pass the test. An individual who is not qualified is not
hired.''

   Singled out for praise from the White
House as the year began, the city police department will close 1990
struggling to restore its image after a rash of brutality and
racism allegations.
   Police brass are developing a ``behavior modification'' program
for offending officers after rising use of force complaints and the
killing of more suspected criminals in 1990 than in the three
previous years combined.
   ``I think everybody is certainly not at the top of their game.
We've had an awful lot of incidents just in the last five months,''
Police Chief Steven Bishop said. ``I think it has hurt the
relations greatly between this police department and the
community.''
   Only a few of his 1,200 officers violate citizen's rights, but
the bad apples are threatening to impair neighborhood confidence in
police, Bishop said.
   The trouble comes after President Bush visited in January to
praise cooperation between police and local anti-crime groups,
calling the city a model for the war on drugs.
   The simmering image crisis reached a fever pitch in late
September, when local television station KMBC-TV broadcast
videotape of officers beating a white man.
   News footage showed officers yanking the man through the open
window of his van and onto the ground, where one officer kicked him
several times and another officer hit him with a small club.
   ``Most officers are just as ashamed and disgusted by what these
officers did as I am and I think the community at large is,'' said
Bishop, a 20-year veteran of the force who became chief in June.
   The man had led officers on an hour-long chase through three
counties. He was charged with trying to run a police officer off
the road.
   The two officers resigned after the incident and Bishop banned
the weighted leather clubs called ``slappers'' that one of the
officers used.
   Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Mike Reardon said a grand jury
would look into the case.
   Last spring, several white officers surrounded and bloodied a
black priest with nightsticks after stopping his car because they
said a passenger matched the description of an armed robber.
Neither the priest nor his companion were charged.
   In another incident, a white officer hit a black minister in the
head with a shotgun. Officers mistakenly thought the man, a native
of Nigeria, was drunk because of his thick accent. He also was not
charged.
   Both clergymen claimed the attacks were racially motivated.
   Officers have shot and killed six suspects so far in 1990,
compared to five over the previous three years. Four of the people
killed were black, and two were white.
   In one case, four officers fired 19 times at a black man
brandishing a barbecue fork.
   Black community leaders said the death was racially motivated,
but a grand jury and Bishop cleared the four officers, two white
and two black, of wrongdoing.
   Bishop suspended the officers who beat the ministers, and he
suspended three undercover officers involved in the shooting of a
black man who remains crippled.
   The chief appointed a task force to develop ways to identify
officers with rough tendencies. The department plans a ``behavior
modification'' program to teach problem officers how to better deal
with citizens.
   Alvin Brooks, the city's human relations director, is a founder
of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, a liaison between the department
and the black community.
   He said the recent cases reinforced a perception in black
neighborhoods that officers want to harass and brutalize blacks.
   ``It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy,'' said Brooks, a former
police officer and prominent black leader.
   Despite the prevailing negative perceptions, Brooks said most
officers enforce the law fairly.
   ``Overall, I don't think you can say it's racism,'' he said. ``I
think it's unfortunate that a few folks, like in any other
profession, lose sight of their mission.''

<HEAD>Budget Dispute Closes Parks, Museums: `It Stinks,' Tourists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Camp David is open as usual for President Bush and his guests,
but the closed sign is hung at the visitors' center in the
surrounding Catoctin National Park.
   It was a scene repeated at national parks from New York to
Hawaii after the federal government ran out of money at midnight
Friday.
   The shutdown ruined some vacations and inconvenienced countless
Americans over the weekend. But its full impact will not be felt
until Tuesday, when federal offices are scheduled to reopen after
the three-day Columbus Day weekend.
   Most of the 2.4 million federal workers were being told to
report to work on Tuesday, but without a budget agreement most
would likely be sent home soon afterward.
   Richard Darman, the White House budget director, said only
workers performing services needed to ``protect life and property''
would stay on the job.
   That includes Weather Service meteorologists, air traffic
controllers, prison guards, meat and poultry inspectors and the
military. Mail delivery would continue since the Postal Office is
not dependent on government appropriations. And the National
Hurricane Center in Miami was continuing to track tropical storm
Klaus.
   Congress and Bush administration officials continued wrangling
over a budget into the night Sunday. Bush, meanwhile, spent most of
the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. The
president opted to travel by motorcade rather than take a
helicopter; it was cheaper that way, a White House aide said.
   Camp David is located in the Catoctin Mountain Park and the
adjacent Cunningham Falls State Park. However, the retreat is a
Navy installation, staffed permanently by Navy personnel and Marine
guards. Its recreational facilities were not subject to the
shutdown.
   In the nation's capital, the Washington Monument, the White
House and the Smithsonian museums were closed. The grounds of the
National Zoo were open, but the animal buildings were not.
   Sightseers could walk around the Lincoln Memorial or the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial but there were no Park Service officials to
answer questions and no cleanup crews to pick up trash. Leaders of
the National Committee for American War Veterans, a volunteer group
that maintains a vigil near the Vietnam memorial, said they would
begin picking up trash on the Mall.
   ``This one's closed, too, Dad,'' was a refrain repeated time
after time around the capital.
   A Roanoke Rapids, N.C., Boy Scout troop had this reaction to the
locked doors at the National Air and Space Museum: ``It stinks.''
   Troop leader Bill Johnson said, ``The boys won't forget this and
I expect they'll go home and tell their parents about what happened
to them.''
   Ironically, the Capitol was one of the few tourist sites open in
Washington. ``Unfortunately we are the only game in town so our
tour guides are really busy,'' said Tom Keating, executive
assistant to the House sergeant at arms.
   Still, the action in the Capitol was limited at best. When the
House came into session at 4 p.m. - only to recess again moments
later - loud booing erupted from the galleries packed with
tourists.
   ``They should have settled the budget instead of going on
vacation,'' said 20-year-old Kara DiMugno of Southington, Conn.,
referring to the long recess members of Congress took in August.
   While the national parks were not closed, services were
virtually nil. For the most part, restrooms were closed, first aid
assistance was not available and guided tours were canceled.
   At the Saratoga National Park in New York, park rangers turned
away a man who annually re-enacts Gen. Horatio Gates' defeat of
British soldiers. Sunday was the 213th anniversary of the
Revolutionary War battle.
   The annual historic fair was canceled at Georgia's Andersonville
National Historic Site, the Confederate prison camp where 123,000
Union soldiers died during the Civil War.
   ``An awful lot of people were angry that we were closing the
gates, but when Congress said close it down, we closed it down,''
said park ranger Mark Ragan.
   John Diehl of Chicago was vacationing in Hawaii and had hoped to
see the Arizona Memorial before heading to the island of Kauai.
Instead he and his friends were greeted by a closed sign.
   ``It's time to elect some new representatives and senators,
since they can't get the budget passed,'' he said, joining other
tourists peering through locked glass doors of the visitor center,
staring out over Pearl Harbor at the memorial.
   At Yosemite National Park in California, visitors were forced to
leave the campgrounds after non-essential rangers were sent home,
but some hikers parked vehicles outside gates and went back in on
foot.
   ``We ought to lay off the people at the top,'' said Richard
Chaboya of San Jose. ``Why attack the pleasures of the average
people.''
   Judy Laymon, a clerk at the private Lake Amistad Resort and
Marina in south Texas on the Rio Grande River, said, ``What I want
to know is are they going to shut down the borders? I'd hate to go
over to Mexico to eat and not be able to get back.''

   Once again, the government finds itself on the
financial precipice because of the inability of a Republican White
House and a Democratic Congress to agree to a solution to the
worsening deficit problem.
   Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about the
impact of budget stalemate on Americans:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Why is the federal government forced to shut down?
   A: Because the budget dispute prevented enactment of any of the
13 regular appropriations bills for fiscal 1991, the federal budget
year that began Oct. 1. The Constitution states that ``No money
shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of
appropriations made by law.'' While some appropriations are in
permanent law, most day-to-day government operations are renewed
annually in one of the 13 spending bills.
   What that means is that government agencies are not allowed to
spend money, including for salaries or purchases, unless there is a
law authorizing them to do so. Since there wasn't even a stopgap
law in place Saturday, the agencies were legally required to send
people home and close down.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Has this ever happened before?
   A: Yes. Similar squabbles have forced the government to shut
down temporarily three times in the past decade.
   It happened briefly in November 1981 when an estimated 400,000
employees were dismissed at midday after President Reagan vetoed an
emergency money bill. On Oct. 4, 1984, about 500,000 government
workers were sent home by Congress' failure to approve an
appropriations bill.
   And on Oct. 16, 1986, the government sent 500,000
``non-essential'' employees home, but Congress later in the day
passed an appropriations bill acceptable to Reagan and workers were
ordered to report on their next shift.
   Congress, as it had done in 1981 and 1984, passed a resolution
ordering that employees furloughed get their regular salaries
anyway.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: What is this ``Gramm-Rudman Act'' I keep hearing so much
about and why was it passed?
   A: Congress enacted the law, named for Sens. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, and Warren Rudman, R-N.H., in 1985 and revised it in 1987.
   In passing the law, Congress in effect admitted that it could
not make the tough choices needed to halt deficit spending without
some outside pressure to force them into it.
   The law requires Congress and the president to reduce the
deficit to predetermined annual targets, leading eventually to a
balanced budget. If the targets are missed, the law requires
across-the-board spending cuts to do the job Congress could not.
   The target for fiscal 1991 is $64 billion, but the president's
estimates are so far above that number that Bush and Congress agree
it is impossible to reach. They will change it to a much higher
number - if they agree on an overall budget package. The result
will be to delay the goal of a balanced budget probably until 1996
or beyond.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: What events prompted the current shutdown?
   A: On Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1990, Bush and the
bipartisan congressional leadership announced agreement on a
five-year, $500 billion deficit-reduction package that included
approximately $134 billion in new taxes. Congress passed and Bush
signed a one-week temporary appropriations bill to keep the
government operating while Congress passed the plan. Bush went on
national television Tuesday night to appeal for congressional
support of the package, but it was decisively voted down Thursday
night.
   Members of the House and Senate approved another stopgap
spending measure, known as a ``continuing resolution,'' on Friday.
That would have kept the government running until Friday, Oct. 12,
and would have given lawmakers another week's time to arrive at a
budget consensus. But Bush vetoed that bill Saturday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: How will the shutdown affect me? Can I still catch my flight,
for example?
   A: The government began closing so-called ``non-essential''
facilities Saturday, including parks and tourist attractions, but
air traffic controllers are among those considered essential.
However, if the deadlock persisted, there would be a reduction in
the number of controllers allowed to work.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: What is meant by ``essential'' and ``non-essential?''
   A: Each agency decides what is an essential service. But,
generally, staying on the job will be workers dealing with national
security, health, emergency and similar things. The military, air
traffic controllers, border guards, medical institution personnel
and prison guards will be unaffected. Federal meat and poultry
inspection will continue during a general shutdown.

   An elephant, a camel, a llama and other
creatures great and small marched through the bronze doors of the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine and down the church's center aisle
in honor of the Feast of St. Francis.
   ``St. Francis Day belongs to the city and all its creatures and
the animals bless us as much as we bless them,'' the Very Rev.
James Parks Morton, dean of the cathedral, said Sunday.
   ``So, in the presence of these beautiful beasts, we will pray
this year for ourselves: that we may have the wisdom and courage to
be more faithful custodians of God's creation,'' he said.
   The procession of borrowed animals also included a horse, goat,
pig, eagle and chimpanzee. Morton also blessed parishioners' pets
and even a petrie dish containing algae and one-celled organisms.
   A smaller animal-blessing celebration was held at St. Paul's
Episcopal Church in Brooklyn.
   Two horses from the Police Department's Mounted Unit and a
police German shepherd, Jake, joined other dogs, cats, snakes, a
ferret, gerbils, a mouse and goldfish in the lineup blessed by the
Rev. Peter Cullen.
   ``I thought on the whole they behaved very well,'' Cullen said.
``They're often better behaved than the people.''
   Afterward, the blessed critters munched on dog biscuits and
carrots - with cookies and soda for the humans.
   The Feast of St. Francis is Oct. 4. The animal-blessing
ceremonies are typically held on the nearest Sunday.
   St. Francis of Assisi, who died in the 13th Century, is
associated with a simple love of nature and is often depicted
preaching to birds.

   The state's welfare providers are going
to have to bite the bullet this year, but not as hard as once
feared, thanks to a last-minute infusion of $93.2 million in
new-found revenue.
   ``This is going to ease the pain ... a lot,'' said Baldwin
Bunkley, budget chairman for a coalition of nearly 100 advocacy
organizations for Florida's economically disadvantaged, including
the poor, homeless and disabled.
   Florida, like other states, is still strapped for cash for
social service programs, but an 11th-hour surge in lottery ticket
sales, coupled with an early loan repayment and money found in
various trust-fund accounts, has helped ease the financial burden
this year.
   As a result, Gov. Bob Martinez and the state Cabinet are to vote
Tuesday on a proposed $54.1 million cut in state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services programs. The figure,
recommended by state budget officials Friday, is down from an
earlier proposed cutback of $147.3 million.
   Officials say the $54.1 million shortfall will still add up to
substantial reductions in programs, however.
   Private day care centers in south and central Florida may have
to stop serving hundreds of poor children whose single mothers are
trying to find work and break the cycle of welfare dependency, said
Jack Levine, executive director of the Florida Center for Youth &amp;
Children.
   Several new programs designed to keep juvenile delinquents out
of detention centers and adult prisons also will be slashed, Levine
said.
   ``These juvenile slots are, pure and simple, prison
prevention,'' he said.
   Also, anyone seriously hurt in an accident could be affected if
the state reduces its support of emergency room equipment and
personnel at hospitals, Bunkley said.
   The need for budget cuts became evident last month when state
economists discovered tax collections would fall $540 million short
of projections. Under the state constitution, Florida must adopt a
balanced budget, but in the past few weeks, the state found $215.2
million to offset the reduced revenues.
   About $80 million came from a loan to the Department of
Transportation from the general revenue fund that wasn't due to be
paid back until 1996. The rest came from trust funds where money is
kept for specific state programs and a windfall of lottery revenues
when sales soared for last month's $106.5 million Lotto jackpot.
   Chris Schuh, executive director of the state Association for
Retarded Citizens, said she was thankful the extra money was found.
   But she noted the proposed cuts also come in a year when
lawmakers are not appropriating cost-of-living increases to private
groups that contract with the state to provide welfare services.
   ``It's a ridiculous situation to be in, that you are thankful
that your programs are not going to be cut,'' she said.

   The spinning drill bit bites into soft pine
an inch from Ed Beherns' left index finger, finding its mark safely
over and over.
   His skill in creating wooden toys would be remarkable for
anyone, but Beherns accomplishes his work without seeing what he's
doing. The 80-year-old craftsman is blind.
   There is no hint that he can't see his work in the finished
wooden tractor-trailer trucks, the small railroad steam engines,
the pickup trucks, wheelbarrows and wooden animals he builds in his
basement shop.
   ``I know just about where everything is - unless somebody moves
it,'' said Beherns, who moves gracefully through the narrow and
twisted passages in his workshop where the musty smell of cedar and
the spicy aroma of freshly worked pine fill the air.
   He says he finds joy building toys, children's rocking chairs,
tables and doll cradles. He sells his work, but only for enough to
cover his expenses.
   And he looks ahead to new challenges.
   In his mind lives the blueprint for a working steam threshing
machine - a scale model of the one his brother, Harry, used to own.
It will be 18 inches long and an alcohol burner will make the
steam.
   The thresher will be metal and Beherns will use the
metal-working skills he developed during a 31-year career at a
Kankakee factory.
   He started working with wood 10 years ago, shortly after he
began losing his sight to glaucoma. A blind craftsman from
Champaign visited him and suggested he try building bird houses.
   Now Beherns has a long waiting list of people who want his
custom-built bird houses to give as holiday gifts.
   His interest in toys originated a bit earlier, when he was
growing up on a farm in Illinois.
   ``When I was a kid - you know there wasn't too much money in
those days - I used to make my own toys,'' he said. ``I made trucks
- a whole construction outfit. Even a crane. And I made a
Caterpillar tractor and put an alarm clock (mechanism) in it to
drive the thing.''
   His blindness makes him an even better toymaker, because now he

   Rabbits beware: There's a hungry
13-foot-long snake in the grass.
   Snake owner Thomas M. Thorton, 26, reported Sunday night that
his pet boa constrictor had slithered away. He told police that the
snake could become ``easily agitated'' because it had not been fed
its usual daily meal of a full-grown rabbit.
   Thorton said the snake measures 1 foot around, 13 feet long and
weighs about 85 pounds. He said he put the snake in the grass for a
moment, and when he looked down his pet had escaped, according to a
police report.
   The Onondaga County Sheriff's Department said a helicopter was
sent to light up the area, near the Burnet Park Zoo, but the snake
was not found.
   Police said they do not believe the snake poses a danger to
people.

<TEXT>
   It took 46 years, but the U.S. Air
Force finally honored a World War II hero with its most prestigious
medal for airborne bravery.
   As family and friends gathered Saturday around his bed at the
Hallmark Nursing Center, a U.S. Air Force colonel pinned the
long-awaited Distinguished Flying Cross on the chest of Jack Ward.
   As co-pilot of a B-24 bomber, an injured Ward continued to fly
his plane over Austria and Hungary after it had been hit, allowing
crew members to parachute to the ground. The pilot had died
instantly.
   ``There are five of us living today because of him.'' said
Gilbert Fisher, the plane's nose gunner from Bethesda, Md.
   A military oversight kept Ward from receiving his medal.
   His wife, Beverly, wrote to politicians and military officials.
Her efforts were futile until a newspaper article caught the
attention of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher.
   Rohrabacher's staff gathered accounts of the mission from those
who flew with Ward and eventually the Air Force relented.
   Ward, 67, a former Los Angeles teacher who suffered a stroke
eight years ago, stared at the ceiling with brimming eyes as he was
praised during Saturday's ceremony.
   Ward was only able to respond with a stick clenched in his
teeth. Pointing to a board with letters on it, he spelled out:
``Thanks for coming.''
   ``I thought, frankly, he was going to be dead before this
happened,'' Mrs. Ward said. ``This is like being able to hear your
own eulogy.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Promoters of Hong Kong's unlimited future as
a capitalist empire brought a glittering road show to Los Angeles
this weekend, with an emphasis on the colony's most glamorous
product - fashion.
   Eager to woo Western investors, the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council played down the impending return of the British crown
colony to China in 1997 and staged a five-day cultural celebration
called ``Festival of the Lantern.''
   Its aim is to show off Hong Kong's best - and opening night was
a Hollywood-style extravaganza with a dazzling fashion show,
colorful lion dances and fireworks lighting up the sky over the
Century City Shopping Center and Marketplace.
   The full moon shone brightly on this replica ff the traditional
Hong Kong moon festival.
   ``We want the public to be aware of Hong Kong,'' said
Christopher Cheng, a garment manufacturer and member of the HTDC
board who helped stage the event. The Los Angeles promotion is one
of 10 being held in cities around the world.
   Cheng's California-based Pacific Coast Highway sportswear firm
is part of his $250 million a year fashion business which
manufacturers 20 percent of its products in Hong Kong.
   Cheng, a native of Hong Kong educated in the United States, has
vowed to keep doing business in Hong Kong long after the 1997
transfer of power.
   The fashion show is a key element in promoting Hong Kong's
image, he said. The territory long has been a fashion manufacturing
hub for American and European firms, but has failed to export many
creations by its own designers.
   ``To raise the status of Hong Kong we have to encourage young
designers,'' Cheng said, as the work of a dozen new fashion names
was displayed on an outdoor runway to the applause of appreciative
shoppers and local dignitaries.
   From the bright harlequin knit sweater jackets and coats of Hidy
Ng to extravagantly beaded gold gowns by Susana To, the show was a
knockout.
   There was oriental influence in the work of Mayeelok whose
``Indian Night'' collection drew gasps of admiration.
   Mayeelok's Thai silk jackets in brilliant shades of green,
orange and gold trimmed in black and embellished in gold were
elegantly teamed with flowing black chiffon skirts and pantaloons.
   Glitter wasn't the only option in this overview of Hong Kong
designs. Wool crepe suits with flowing capes were the forte of
Dominic Mok of M.D.P. Fashion Studio whose hooded, rust-colored
coat drew loud applause.
   Earth tones, pleated sleeves and wide swinging skirts were
features of innovative knit ensembles by Savy Wong and Patrina Tam.
   Long skirts and trumpet sleeves also showed up in the silk
jacquard designs of Sandy Liu for Retkie International.
   The formals, however, stole the show. The black velvet and
chiffon gowns of Ben Yeung of Benny's Fashion and Design Center and
the ruffled, pleated and beaded chiffon numbers by Patrick Li of
Archee were anybody's dream dresses.
   The ultimate in glamour came from Susana To whose gold-upon-gold
creations were show stoppers.
   With fringed gold gloves and shoulder-length gold earrings as
accessories, these dresses were world class. A floor-length black
velvet sheath with long sleeves, slit up the front and trimmed in
gold and white beading was fit for a movie queen.

<HEAD>Report: Alcoholism, Drug Abuse Much Higher Among Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of alcoholism and drug abuse among
homosexuals may be three times as high as for people in society's
mainstream, it was reported today.
   Three out of every 10 homosexuals have a drinking or drug abuse
problem, according to figures from the National Lesbian and Gay
Health Foundation.
   About one out of 10 people in mainstream society have the same
types of problems, according to The Boston Globe, which cited the
gay health group's figures.
   Fraelean Curtis, a Boston clinical social worker and president
of the National Association of Lesbian and Gay Alcoholism
Professionals, said lesbians are at even greater risk of substance
abuse than gay men because they also must deal with sexism in a
society that tends to devalue women.
   Many homosexuals may turn to alcohol or drugs because they
suffer from ``diminished self-esteem and impaired sense of
self-worth,'' said Don Wert, executive director of the Pride
Institute in Minnesota, an in-patient substance abuse center
specifically for homosexuals.
   ``That's not unlike other marginalized social groups,'' Wert
said. ``Among native Americans and in black and Hispanic
communities, you tend to see the same overrepresentation of
addiction.''
   In the case of homosexuals, finding a cure for substance abuse
can be more difficult, Wert said.
   ``Ordinarily, clients (who) are recovering from alcohol and
drugs tend to feel better about themselves,'' he said.
   ``But for lesbian and gay clients, you're taking away their
anesthesia, and they are feeling ... more strongly than ever their
sense of not being OK, of being alien in their own communities,
schools, churches and homes.
   ``The difference in treatment for lesbians and gay people is
that part of their recovery means examining, understanding,
affirming and ultimately celebrating their sexuality also,'' Wert
said.

<HEAD>KGB Boards Greenpeace Ship off Soviet Arctic Nuclear Test Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed KGB border guards boarded a Greenpeace
vessel in the arctic early today after it defied a Soviet ban and
sent four activists ashore to a Soviet nuclear test site,
environmentalists aboard the ship said.
   The Dutch-registered ship MV Greenpeace stopped in the Barents
Sea off Novaya Zemlya island after the Soviet icebreaker threatened
to open fire, and allowed the 15 Soviets aboard.
   Radio contact with the Greenpeace was lost about 20 minutes
later, Shannon Fagan of Greenpeace in Norway said.
   In a radio report from the ship, activist Steve Shallhorn said
the Soviets who boarded told the Greenpeace crew that their ship
had violated Soviet territory.
   A few hours earlier, the protesters sent four activists ashore
in rubber raft, Shallhorn said.
   ``We don't know if they are aware that our party went ashore. We
are going to try to stay in the area until we get our landing party
back, which could take a couple days,'' he said. He said the ship
was four miles from the island.
   In Moscow, KGB spokesman Viktor Pressman said the agency had no
information on the Greenpeace ship. The KGB supervises border
guards who would be involvced in such an action.
   The MV Greenpeace, with about 35 Western activists and five
Soviets aboard, had permission to tour the Soviet arctic but has
been told by the Soviets to steer clear of Novaya Zemlya, where the
anti-nuclear organization had planned a protest.
   The island was a primary Soviet nuclear test site until the
early 1960s. Greenpeace claims it was used as recently as 1988.
   The group claims new tests are planned there, stirring
opposition in Nordic government circles and among other
environmental groups.
   Shallhorn said the icebreaker, armed with deck guns, had pursued
the MV Greenpeace since Wednesday and had threatened to fire ``so
we decided to stop.''

<HEAD>Doctor: Baby Diagnosed With Usually Fatal Heart Defect Heals Self</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An infant diagnosed with a usually
fatal heart defect healed by himself, amazing doctors who thought a
transplant was the only way to save his life.
   The parents of 9-week-old Weston Wells Kilpatrick will be able
to bring him home this week, officials at Loma Linda University
Medical Center said.
   Dr. Steven Gundry, a pioneer in infant heart transplant surgery,
said it is unlikely the child will ever need a transplant.
   ``It's the first time we've seen it,'' Gundry said Saturday,
adding that he believed the healed birth defect was unprecedented
in medical history.
   Weston, who was born July 27, was brought to Loma Linda
University Medical Center when he was 4 days old, after doctors
concluded he had hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
   The boy's damaged heart grew stronger as he waited for a heart
transplant donor, Gundry said.
   ``Theoretically, we knew the left ventricle might be able to
grow, because we know the right ventricle can grow if you keep the
blood flowing, but to our knowledge it has never been reported for
the left ventricle,'' the doctor said.
   Parents Layne and Janet Kilpatrick, both 31, had moved from
Lompoc to Redlands to be near the medical center known for advances
in child heart transplants.
   Doctors determined Weston's heart had three abnormalities that
would normally have killed a baby within two weeks if left
untreated, Gundry said.
   He had an abnormal mitral valve, which regulates the flow of
blood through the heart; an abnormally small left ventricle, the
pumping chamber of the left side of the heart; and a constricted
aorta, the main artery that carries blood through the body.
   As the family waited for a heart donor, doctors treated Weston
with a drug that kept open a heart blood vessel that normally shuts
down after birth.
   A few weeks ago, doctors noticed that the baby's left ventricle
had grown considerably and was gradually becoming functional.
   A surgical team successfully performed an operation Friday to
enlarge Weston's narrowed artery and to close the artery that was
no longer needed.
   Gundry said Weston may need minor surgery in the future, but
will probably not need a heart transplant.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Release of British Hostages Expected Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beirut newspaper today quoted diplomats
as saying final arrangements were being made for the release of
British hostages believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists i
Lebanon.
   It was the latest in a series of reports predicting some would
be freed this week.
   In related development, a British newspaper quoted a Shiite
leader in Lebanon as saying the future of Western hostages should
no longer be linked to that of Arab prisoners.
   The paper, the Independent, said the statement could herald a
breakthrough in efforts to secure the release of the 13 Westerners
missing and believed held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite
fundamentalists.
   A series of news reports have predicted the release of foreign
hostages following the restoration of British and Iranian
diplomatic ties in late September after an interruption of 19
months.
   The ties were broken during the dispute over Iranian death
threats against British novelist Salman Rushdie.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran apparently has been seeking
to free the hostages to help improve relations with the West
following the June 1989 death of his country's fundamentalist
patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Rafsanjani has been opposed
by radicals in his own government.
   The leftist Beirut newspaper, As-Safir, today quoted
unidentified diplomats as saying the release of the British
captives ``awaits the proper time.'' But it said arrangements for
freeing them have been put ``on a hot burner.''
   It was impossible to verify the report. The paper is known to
maintain close links with leftist and fundamentalist Shiite
factions.
   The Beirut paper said the fate of the foreign hostages also
depends on the Lebanese government extending its authority to
``greater Beirut,'' which includes the southern slums.
   Those slums, where most of the Westerners are believed held, are
a stronghold for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
umbrella group for the captors.
   The Syrian-backed government of President Elias Hrawi has
pledged to spread its authority over all of Beirut as a step toward
ending the 15-year civil war.
   In another report, the conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar said
Sunday that an unidentified Iranian envoy had arrived in Beirut to
complete preparations for freeing Anglican church envoy Terry Waite
``in the next few days.''
   Arab sources in Syria said Sunday that Syrian officials were
making strenuous efforts to free some Westerners missing in
Lebanon.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was trying hard ``to resolve the
issue but was encountering unexpected obstacles.''
   He did not elaborate, but he noted that Sharaa was expected to
meet soon with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to
discuss the issue.
   Ad-Diyar said Waite's release was expected to be ``the preface
to releasing all British hostages in Lebanon.''
   Waite, 51, the envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury,
disappeared in west Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987. He had left his hotel
for a meeting with Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the group
that claims to hold American captives Terry Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held foreign captive. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   The other missing Britons are journalist John McCarthy, retired
pilot Jack Mann and writer Alec Collett.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems claimed in
1986 that it hanged Collett in retaliation for Britain's support of
U.S. air raids on Libya. No body was produced, but British
officials believe Collett is dead.
   In its report today, the Independent quoted Sheikh Mohamed
Hussein Fadlallah as saying the hostage issue ``can be settled in
such a way that no party feels he has been blackmailed.''
   The sheikh as described as the most important spiritual adviser
to Hezbollah.
   In the past, kidnappers have said the Western hostages won't all
be freed until the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails and of Shiite extremists held in Kuwait.
   Fadlallah said he believed, as earlier reports have indicated,
that the 15 Moslems imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the French and
U.S. embassies there in 1983 had escaped after the Iraqi Aug. 2
invasion.
   He said he believes they are no longer in Kuwait.
   ``We call on every side that could do something about this
humanitarian issue to dissociate these two problems from each
other,'' the sheikh said.
   The sheikh was also quoted as saying he had been interviewed by
Anderson two days before the American reporter was abducted.
   ``I tried very hard to help him on several occasions, and I was
unable to do so. But the change in the political atmosphere in the
region and in the world could bring about a happy result,'' the
sheikh was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>New Orleans Teachers Vote to End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 3,000 teachers voted to end their
3-week-old strike immediately and accept a contract offering 7
percent pay raises over the next three years.
   ``We obviously didn't get all that we wanted, but it's enough to
recommend a settlement,'' Nat LaCour, head of United Teachers of
New Orleans, said shortly before Sunday night's voice vote to
approve the pact.
   Teachers were to return to their classrooms today.
   According to New Orleans School Board President Carl Robinson,
the new contract includes a 3 percent pay raise for the current
school year, no raise next year and a 4 percent raise during the
1992-93 school year.
   The school board will have to cut $7 million in programs and
personnel to finance the new contract, Robinson said.
   The board also agreed not to punish strikers in exchange for the
teachers agreeing to drop a recall movement against board members,
LaCour said.
   Some teachers expressed anger over the recall-reprisal
agreement, but LaCour said union members agreed to both it and the
new contract in separate votes.
   ``They blackmailed the union that we cannot recall them,''
complained teacher Betty Sapp. ``We're political hostages for the
next three years.''
   ``I went on strike because the board wasn't being fair with
us,'' said teacher Virginia Pluta. ``Now I don't think the union is
being fair with us. I'm very, extremely upset with the union right
now.''
   About 3,000 of the 4,500 teachers in Louisiana's largest school
district went on strike beginning Sept. 17. School officials used
substitutes to help keep classes in session for the district's
68,000 students.

<TEXT>
   The dollar nose-dived against the Japanese yen and
the soaring British pound today in early European trading, but it
rose against most other foreign currencies. Gold prices fell.
   The pound rocketed as it trading for the first time since being
linked to Europe's other currencies after its weekend entry into
the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
   Shares prices in London also soared at the opening before
falling back but still well up from Friday.
   In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9795, nearly 3.5 cents
higher than $1.9455 late Friday.
   The pound was quoted at $1.9115 at Thursday's close, so the
currency has jumped more than 7 cents since the Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major's surprise announcement late Friday afternoon.
   The Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Currency System
links European currencies to one another to avoid huge swings in
exchange rates. With British membership, 10 of the currencies of
the 12-nation European community are linked in the system.
   Under the rules of ERM membership, the British government is
obliged to halt any rise in the pound outside its upper band of
3.13 German marks to the pound. Sterling is allowed to range within
6 percent of its central rate of 2.96, so its lowest exchange rate
is 2.77 marks.
   If the currency goes too high, Britain must lower its exchange
rate either by selling sterling or reducing interest rates.
   Some traders said they expected central bank intervention before
the end of the week.
   ``Sterling is not a totally free lunch,'' said Geoffrey Dennis,
international economist at James Capel &amp; Co.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 3.67 yen to a 1{-year low against the
Japanese yen, closing at 130.05 yen. Later, in London, it was
quoted at a higher rate of 130.80 yen.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain sidelined today,
with the Columbus Day national holiday in the United States and
because of the continuing budget negotiations.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   -1.5370 German marks, up from 1.5372
   -1.2865 Swiss francs, up from 1.2847
   -5.1477 French francs, up from 5.1473
   -1.7365 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7340
   -1,151.50 Italian lire, up from 1,150.50
   -1.1510 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1500
   Gold prices were recovering after being pushed sharply lower in
Asian trading, dealers said.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$391.25 per ounce at midmorning, down from $394.35 bid per ounce
late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $391.00, down from $394.40 late

<HEAD>Most Americans Know Little About Hepatitis B, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hepatitis B, an inflammation of the liver, kills
about 14 Americans every day, but a Gallup survey to be released
today indicates most people know almost nothing about the disease.
   ``The survey shows that 69 percent of all U.S. adults, from
18-55, do not know that a vaccine exists to prevent people from
becoming infected with hepatitis B,'' said Dr. David L. Hoff,
medical director of the Akron, Ohio, City Health System.
   Eighty-three percent of those surveyed also acknowledged they
knew little or nothing about the disease, Hoff said.
   The results were to be discussed by Hoff during the annual
meeting of the American Academy of Family Physicians today.
   Some 1,000 people were surveyed nationwide by telephone Sept.
10-17 as part of a patient and physician education program for
SmithKline Beecham.
   Hoff said of the adults questioned, nearly two-thirds were
married, 40 percent were high school graduates or had taken
technical courses and 40 percent had taken college courses or had
college degrees.
   ``The real cause of concern of the data from this survey is the
lack of awareness of the seriousness of the disease and the
availability of a preventive vaccine,'' Hoff said. ``This is
particularly worrisome when you think of those in our society who
are presumably less in touch with such issues and could be at high
risk for contracting the disease.
   Officials say that about 300,000 persons are afflicted annually
by the disease in the United States and about 5,000 people,
including 300 health care workers, die of the disease or its
complications.
   The virus, spread by blood or other body fluids, is many times
more contagious than Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the cause
of AIDS, officials say.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says that persons with
multiple sexual partners and people who use injectable illicit
drugs are at risk of contracting the virus and should get the
vaccine.

<HEAD>CITATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute has today decided
to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1990 jointly
to Joseph E. Murray and E. Donnall Thomas for their discoveries
concerning ``Organ and Cell Transplantation in the Treatment of
Human Disease.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUMMARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is given for
discoveries that have enabled the development of organ and cell
transplantation into a method for the treatment of human disease.
   Joseph E. Murray discovered how rejection following organ
transplantation in man could be mastered, E. Donnall Thomas managed
to diminish the severe reaction that the graft can cause in the
recipient, i.e. the so-called ``graft-versus-host'' reaction (GVH).
In addition, Thomas could show that intravenously infused bone
marrow cells were able to repopulate the bone marrow and produce
new blood cells.
   Murray successfully transplanted a kidney between homozygous
twins for the first time. He pioneered transplantation of kidneys
obtained from deceased persons and could show that patients with
terminal renal insufficiency could be cured. The field was then
open for transplantation of other organs such as liver, pancreas
and heart.
   Thomas was successful in transplanting bone marrow cells from
one individual to another. Bone marrow transplantation can cure
severe inherited disorders such as thalassemia and disorders of the
immune system as well as leukemia and aplastic anemia.
   Murray's and Thomas' discoveries are crucial for those tens of
thousands of severely ill patients who either can be cured or given
a decent life when other treatment methods are without success.

   A tropical depression was all that remained this
morning of Klaus, the 11th named storm and the sixth hurricane of
the Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters said.
   But Klaus, which briefly reached hurricane status Friday, left
at least six dead and 1,500 homeless in the northeastern Caribbean
before being downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm.
   The system late Sunday dropped again, this time to tropical
depression strength, with top winds this morning reaching only 35
mph.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression was centered near 20.6 north and
68.8 west, or about 145 miles northeast of Puerto Plata in the
Dominican Republic, according to the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   The depression was moving west-northwest at near 15 mph and was
expected to maintain that heading and forward speed for the next 24
hours, said officials at the hurricane center. Little change in
strength was expected today.

<HEAD>Some Hard Hitting, But No Knockouts in Wilson-Feinstein Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson traded
sharp jabs and barbed one-liners over abortion, campaign
fund-raising and leadership qualities in the first of two scheduled
debates in the California governor's race.
   Feinstein attacked Wilson's absenteeism from the U.S. Senate,
and he criticized her record on taxes. Sunday's televised debate
produced no knockouts but drew political blood from both
candidates.
   Although both are seasoned politicians, each postured as the
political outsider while criticizing the other as the establishment
candidate. Feinstein, the Democratic former mayor of San Francisco,
has 20 years in public office; Wilson, California's Republican U.S.
senator, has held various elective offices for 24 years.
   Feinstein repeatedly keyed on Wilson's political ties to the
policies of retiring Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, describing
Wilson as ``the candidate for the status quo.''
   Wilson endorsed Proposition 140, which limits the number of
terms in political office and is bitterly opposed by most state
legislators. He also stressed Feinstein's political alliance with
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Senate President pro tem David
Roberti.
   ``I am not beholden,'' said Wilson. ``I do not owe Willie. I do
not owe David.''
   Feinstein sharply responded: ``Well, senator, if you really feel
you can't handle Willie Brown or David Roberti, then stay in
Washington. I'll handle them.''
   Each candidate tried to out-do the other in appealing to voters
who are pro-choice on abortion.
   ``I've been pro-choice longer than Dianne Feinstein,'' Wilson
said.
   Feinstein fired back with a recitation of alleged contradictions
between Wilson's pro-choice statements and Senate votes against
abortion funds.
   ``Pete Wilson isn't pro-choice,'' she said. ``I think he's
multiple choice.''
   Wilson also mocked the ``tough and caring'' slogan of
Feinstein's television commercials, saying that as mayor she
supported a utility tax that fell hardest on the elderly and poor.
   ``I don't think that was very caring. Tough, but not caring,''
Wilson said.
   He also criticized Feinstein for taking large campaign donations
in the wake of a judge's overturning of Proposition 73, which had
limited individual donations to $1,000.
   Feinstein accused Wilson of having ``the worst attendance record
in the Congress,'' missing votes on the death penalty, Supreme
Court confirmation, Middle East resolutions and the budget.
   Some observers gave Feinstein a slight edge in delivery and
Wilson a slight edge in content, but nearly all agreed that both
candidates probably did a better job of pleasing voters already
committed to them than winning new supporters.
   A second debate is scheduled next week in San Francisco. Recent
polls have found the race to be a toss-up.

   Pengun the musk ox has already learned to
maneuver a ceiling sling at Point Defiance Zoo since her left
foreleg was amputated in September.
   A veterinarian now hopes infections heal enough to allow her to
become perhaps the first musk ox in the world to receive an
artificial leg. But fitting a 300-pound animal with a prosthesis
can be tricky.
   ``This is a unique, special animal at a unique, special zoo,''
said veterinarian Rick Williams. ``This probably won't happen again
for 100 years.''
   The 10-year-old musk ox fell one night in August and hurt her
left leg, zoo authorities said. After the leg became infected,
veterinarians were forced to amputate.
   Williams is waiting for the infection to heal before he tries
fitting Pengun with an artificial leg.
   Pengun, which means ``little hill'' in Aleut, was brought to the
Tacoma zoo with five other musk oxen from Nunivak Island, Alaska,
in 1981.

<HEAD>Whale Pod Numbers in Prince William Sound Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pod of killer whales in Prince
William Sound is declining in number, according to researchers
studying whether the whales were affected by the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill.
   The study, sponsored by the National Marine Fisheries Service,
is finding that the number of whales in the AB pod, a family group
that lives much of the year in the western part of the sound, has
dropped from 35 animals to as few as 22 during the past two
summers.
   ``Nothing like this has been documented before,'' said Craig
Matkin, a marine zoologist conducting the Prince William Sound
study.
   ``They're all missing out of one pod,'' he said. ``It's a pod
that's been very stable. ... The mortality rate for mature females,
especially, (has been) just almost nil.''
   Yet researchers in the sound last summer could not find seven
whales, including several females, and another five or six whales
appeared to be missing when scientists returned to the sound this
summer, Matkin said.
   Killer whales in ``resident'' pods, like the AB pod, travel in
female-dominated packs, Matkin said. Several of the AB pod mothers
and offspring are apparently missing, and some young whales have
been seen accompanying older females other than their mothers.
   ``The whole social structure seems to be breaking down as we
lose more females,'' Matkin said. ``We're worried about the future
of the pod,'' he said.
   As many as a dozen other killer whale pods along the Gulf of
Alaska also are being studied, but apparently have not experienced
unusual population drops, he said.
   Speculation about the causes of the population changes in the AB
pod are being kept confidential, as are most publicly funded
scientific data from spill-related studies. Lawyers for the federal
and state governments have said releasing information now could
hurt them years from now in court when they try to recover money
from Exxon for the damage caused by the spill.

<HEAD>Japan Responds Cautiously to Reports of Soviet Concession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese officials responded cautiously today to
reports that the Soviet Union may be willing to return some of the
disputed islands that have been the main barrier to better ties
between the two nations.
   Japanese newspapers said on Sunday that Soviet officials offered
the compromise over the southern Kuril islands to a group of
Japanese lawmakers who visited Moscow late last month.
   ``The proposal shows a desire to improve Japan-Soviet
relations,'' Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said in a statement.
But he added that Japan has demanded the return of all the islands,
which were seized by the Soviets at the end of World War II.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, talking to reporters on his trip
to Saudi Arabia, said he would carefully consider the proposal if
it were delivered through formal channels.
   However, the Soviet news agency Tass said the Soviet Foreign
Ministry had not made any new proposals to Japan concerning the
islands.
   Tass quoted a senior Soviet diplomat as saying reports that the
Soviet Union had expressed readiness to transfer a portion of the
island chain to Japan did not reflect the facts. He said the Soviet
Foreign Ministry was preparing a refutation of the reports.
   Both sides recently have seemed eager to resolve the 45-year-old
dispute.
   For the Soviet Union, improved ties could mean a much-needed
infusion of capital from Japan's financial reserves.
   For Japan, an agreement could open the way to joint development
of the Soviet Union's plentiful natural resources, particularly
Siberian oil.
   The disputed territory consists of three islands and a cluster
of islets off northern Japan totaling only 2,000 square miles.
   The Soviets claim them as historically Russian territory, while
Tokyo insists they were ceded to Japan in 19th-century agreements.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted governing party officials as
saying that Soviet officials had proposed a new bilateral agreement
that would confirm a 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. In that
declaration, Moscow agreed to return one island and a group of
smaller islands.
   But when Japan signed a mutual security treaty with the United
States in 1960, the Soviet Union declared it would return the
islands only after all foreign troops were withdrawn from Japan.
   Kyodo said the Soviet compromise proposal also called for a
peace treaty within three to five years after the two countries
sign the agreement. Because of the dispute, the nations have never
officially ended their war hostilities.

<HEAD>Researchers Hopeful Captive Dolphins Will Adapt to Wild</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After two years in captivity, Echo and
Misha spent a second day in freedom today - with scientists looking
over their shoulders to see how captive dolphins adapt in the wild.
   The two dolphins will be under scrutiny of the Mote Marine
Laboratory for the next year. The scientists watched anxiously
Saturday when the duo's flight to freedom got off to a somewhat
rocky start.
   Seconds after being lowered into the water, Echo and Misha sped
away - and promptly beached themselves on a sandbar. Researchers
swam to the animals and gave them a second shove to liberty.
   ``It will take them a while to get their bearings,'' said
conservation biologist Randy Wells. ``When they start swimming
along the coast and socializing with other dolphins - then we'll
call it a success.''
   Within an hour, the two were spotted swimming with a pod of
about three dolphins.
   Wells, affiliated with the Chicago Zoological Society, took the
dolphins from the same harbor off Ruskin in the summer of 1988 for
a project at the University of California-Santa Cruz to study the
sophisticated system of sounds dolphins use to gather information
about their watery environment.
   Last month, the two 300-pound dolphins were transported to Mote
on Central Florida's Gulf Coast to prepare for their return home.
   While other captive dolphins have been released in the wild,
Wells said this is the first project involving electronic
monitoring and tracking to find out how captive dolphins readjust
and socialize.
   Successful reintroduction into Tampa Bay could open up new
vistas. It could mean that in the future, dolphins might only need
to be taken from the wild long enough to breed with captive
dolphins to replenish the gene pool.
   Already, a Perth, Australia, oceanarium that closed down has
inquired about the project amid plans to free its nine dolphins.
   ``Controversy about dolphins in captivity seems to grow every
day,'' Ms. Dieffenwierth said. ``If we find they can be
reassimilated, putting them back in the wild may be a solution.''

<TEXT>
   Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau says he urged
wife Jane Pauley to ``walk away from NBC altogether'' when she was
edged off the ``Today'' show in favor of Deborah Norville.
   Trudeau wanted to satirize the morning program in his irreverent
comic strip because ``it had a formal, Kabuki-like quality ... that
would have been a natural for me,'' he said in a rare interview in
the Oct. 15 issue of Newsweek magazine.
   But Pauley's broadcast career appears, in retrospect, to have
benefited from her move. And Trudeau says writing about his own
family in his comic strip would be ``a violation (as well as)
infinitely banal.''
   Pauley has wrestled with the same conflict between public and
private lives. She told People magazine last week that she'd love
to interview her husband, ``but a) he would never do it, and b) I
would not ultimately do it. But I know it's a neat story.''
   Trudeau said he decided to talk with Newsweek to commemorate the
20th anniversary of the strip's syndication. He wisely chose a
magazine - Pauley had told People she'd ``be really irritated'' if
he did an interview with a rival television network.

<TEXT>
   In this town overlooking the Plain of
Armageddon, Israeli civilians have begun picking up the gas masks
their government is distributing to counter a feared Iraqi chemical
attack.
   Government officials launched the program Sunday in Yoqneam,
where the Bible says the battle of Judgment Day will be waged, and
in two other small towns. They say they will provide the free masks
to all 4.7 million Israelis, which is expected to take several
weeks.
   Officials tried to promote calm as residents trickled into
instruction centers in school classrooms, where soldiers showed how
to use gas masks and poison antidotes.
   The classrooms were festooned with the handiwork of pupils, and
children received colored gas masks to help ease their fears.
   ``It's colorful and pretty so the child should not get afraid,''
said a female instructor, holding up a red-and-yellow gas mask for
infants.
   ``It's troubling,'' said Aliza Artzi, after putting her
2-year-old daughter through a plastic anti-gas tent for infants.
Her daughter, Tali, seemed unphased.
   Ms. Artzi said she hoped the kit would never be needed, but
believed otherwise. Asked whether she believes war is likely, she
said, ``I think so.''
   Officials said that within days, they will have handed out masks
to the 30,000 people of Ofakim, Kfar Yona and Yoqneam.
   Israelis have already paid for their gas masks through their
obligatory national insurance premiums.
   The army says most Palestinians in the occupied territories will
not be given the protection kits since they do not pay national
insurance. However, they will however be able to purchase the kits
bought by the army in Europe at cut-rate prices of about $20 each.
   The government announced the program a week ago during an
escalation of tensions in the 2-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to draw Israel into a
war if his country is attacked, and he has threatened to use
chemical weapons.
   Yoqneam, a hilltop town of 7,000 about 40 miles north of Tel
Aviv, has problems that extend far beyond fears of chemical attack.
Indeed, it is a microcosm of Israel's setbacks, as well as its
successes.
   An immigrant town, it was a showcase of the Jewish melting pot,
a thriving community of Moroccans, Russians, Kurds, Romanians,
Iraqis, Bulgarians and native-born Sabras. But this summer, its
biggest employer, the Soltam munitions plant, went under and the
work force has fallen from 4,500 to 150.
   Sacked workers who occupied the building were ousted by guards
with attack dogs, leaving Yoqneam deeply embittered.
   Now, with unemployment at 15 percent, Russian immigrants are
pouring in - 400 so far this year.
   Some of them were shopping in the supermarket on Sunday before
heading up the hill to the Oranim school to pick up gas masks.
   ``They don't really understand what it's all about,'' said Eva
Maman, a saleswoman. ``They have other problems.''
   At the school sat a cross-section of Israel: an elderly man in a
skullcup, a young woman in a designer T-shirt and sunglasses, a
middle-age couple perspiring from the exhausting uphill hike to the
school, and the Artzi family, their little girl sucking furiously
at her pacifier as the instructor described symptoms of gas
poisoning - trembling, bodily secretions, inflamed eyes.
   ``This is the injection. Orange up, green down,'' barked the
tough-looking instructor in olive-green uniform.
   ``How do you remember? Easy. Orange - the sun - up; green - the
grass - down.''
   The army instructors also handed out leaflets in Hebrew, Arabic,
Russian and English. Hebrew and Russian placards decorated the
walls.
   There was no hint of panic. The schools were empty for the
Jewish festival of Sukkot so no classes were disrupted. Yoqneam
snoozed away the hot afternoon hours.
   Men played backgammon in a coffee shop. A car driven by Hassidic
Jews passed by with music blaring from loudspeakers, towing a
mobile sukkah, the traditional hut in which the observant spend the
eight-day holiday.

   Jury selection began today in the assault
trial of a man who is also a suspect in last month's slayings of
five college students in Gainesville.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey, who has been under intense scrutiny by
investigators and the media since his arrest by Brevard County
authorities, is accused of beating his 79-year-old grandmother - a
charge both he and the grandmother deny.
   Retired Judge Theron A. Yawn, visiting from Alachua County to
preside over the misdemeanor case, summoned 20 prospective jurors
for initial questioning. The trial needs six jurors.
   Attorneys for Humphrey say they expect it will take a long time
to select a jury because of the publicity surrounding the unrelated
slayings.
   The 18-year-old University of Florida freshman was arrested on
the assault charge Aug. 29. Shortly afterward, investigators
publicly named him as a suspect in the deaths of the five students,
whose bodies were discovered the three preceding days.
   Humphrey has remained jailed on $1 million bond. If convicted,
he could be sentenced to up to 5{ years in prison.
   Humphrey is charged in connection with an incident the night of
Aug. 29, when he left Gainesville and returned to his Indiatlantic
home. Police were called, and his grandmother, Elna Hlavaty told
them Humphrey had hit her.
   She has since refused to press charges, and has denied that her
grandson hit her.

<TEXT>
   Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, who blazed a new path for
the treatment of leukemia when he performed the first human bone
marrow transplant in 1956, said today he always considered the
Nobel Prize ``a long shot at best.''
   Thomas, 70, of Bellevue, Wash., and Joseph E. Murray, 71, were
awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine today, officials in Stockhom,
Sweden announced.
   Murray, affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,
was recognized for his discovery of a method to prevent tissue
rejection when organs are transplanted in people.
   Thomas, with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, said he learned of the good news when awakened by a
reporter's telephone call early this morning.
   ``I really thought this work was too clinical to ever win the
prize,'' Thomas said. ``There are many scientist-researchers out
there who are eligible for this prize.
   ``It's a long shot at best, and it would be a mistake to waste
time thinking about winning it.''
   The prize shared by Murray and Thomas, worth $695,000, is
endowed by the will of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in
1896.
   Thomas said he hasn't had time yet to think of what he will do
with the money.
   Thomas, who took after his father and fulfilled his childhood
desire to become a doctor, performed the first human bone marrow
transplant in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1956.
   The surgical procedure has become standard treatment for many
sufferers of leukemia and lymphoma, which are types of cancer.
   Thomas joined the University of Washington faculty in 1963 and
went to the Hutchinson center when it opened in 1975. The center is
now one of the world'sleading cancer treatment and research
institutions.
   ``I think it's a recognition of a lot of work by a lot of people
who have worked on the problems over the years. I have a medical
team here of some 50 physicians and Ph.D.s who now work with me on
this. It's been very gratifying to see the procedure become
accepted as the primary form of treatment for leukemia,'' Thomas
said.
   In a bone marrow transplant, the patient's diseased marrow is
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. Disease-free marrow is
removed by needle from the hip bone of a donor, often a relative,
and dripped intravenously into the patient. In time, the
transplanted cells begin to grow in the patient's marrow and
produce new white and red blood cells and platelets.

   Dr. Joseph E. Murray, who won the Nobel Prize in
medicine today, was chief surgeon of a team whose pioneering
transplant operation 35 years ago began the now-routine business of
shifting organs from person to person.
   That operation, the first success after 15 failures, at last
showed that transplants were possible. But several more years
passed before doctors found ways to reliably outsmart the body's
natural defenses against alien organs.
   The Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave
the prestigious medical prize jointly to Murray, 71, and Dr. E.
Donnall Thomas, 70, whose work helped diminish the severe reaction
that bone marrow grafts can cause in recipients.
   Although the two physicians did not collaborate on their
prize-winning work, Murray recalled today that they began their
careers together at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, where
Murray still practices.
   ``He was a resident in medicine and I was a resident in
surgery,'' Murray recalled. ``This was after World War II. We both
started working in transplants together, but from different angles.
It's marvelous to share it with him.''
   Murray spoke by telephone from his daughter's house in the San
Francisco suburb of Lafayette. He was in the Bay area for an
American College of Surgeons conference.
   ``I was sound asleep and my daughter came in and woke me up and
said, `Daddy, I have good news for you,''' Murray said. ``I
couldn't believe it, obviously.''
   He gave credit to his chief of surgery, Dr. Francis D. Moore,
and said he had been thinking about all of his colleagues, although
he had not spoken to them yet.
   ``I just talked to my family. That of course is most
important,'' he said. ``We have six children and they called from
all over the country.''
   Murray's groundbreaking operation was performed Dec. 23, 1954 at
Brigham Hospital. Doctors removed a healthy kidney from 23-year-old
Ronald Herrick and gave it to his identical brother, Richard.
   Richard lived for seven more years. He died of heart disease
that was a complication of his underlying kidney disorder.
   The Herrick brothers were genetically identical. Their operation
did not answer the problem of shifting organs between people whose
tissues are not exactly the same.
   The Brigham team showed that such operations might be possible
in 1959, when they transplanted kidneys between brothers who were
fraternal, not identical, twins.
   The doctors gave the recipient cortisone and low weekly doses of
radiation in an effort to suppress his immune defenses. But they
did not believe the treatment was powerful enough to stop rejection
and were unsure why the operation succeeded.
   In 1962, Murray performed the first successful kidney transplant
from an unrelated donor. The key to this operation was the drug
azathioprine, which suppresses the body's immune system and keeps
it from fighting off the new organ.
   Dr. George Hitchings, a co-developer of the drug, won the Nobel
Prize in medicine two years ago.
   Americans have now won or shared the prize in medicine 32 times
in the past 21 years, compared with 19 winners from all other
countries combined.
   The prize shared by Murray and Thomas, worth $695,000, is
endowed by the will of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in
1896.

5th graf, `The headboard ...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins said today that whatever his
new bed's headboard cost - and it reportedly cost $11,500 - the
city will not pay a penny of it.
   The mayor said he has instructed city officials to find out by
Tuesday whether it really took $11,500 for a city carpenter to
duplicate a headboard that would have cost $1,600 in a store.
   ``Whatever the explanation, the city will not pay a single penny
of the cost,'' Dinkins said in a statement issued by his press
secretary, Albert Scardino. ``It will all be covered by private
donations from friends of the city, many of whom have contacted me
this morning to offer their contributions.''
   Dinkins was stung by a Newsweek magazine story about the
headboard, which came days after the city's money woes prompted the
mayor to freeze hiring, propose new taxes and raise the possibility
of laying off 15,000 city employees.
   Dinkins said the headboard was delivered to Gracie Mansion, the
mayor's official residence, on Friday. It was built to match other
pieces of a bedroom set that Dinkins said he paid for himself.
   ``I wish somebody would ask me why don't I seek reimbursement
for the $8,000 or $9,000 I spent on the bedroom suite. No questions
have come to me in that regard. I contributed that,'' he said
Sunday at the Pulaski Day parae.
   Dinkins' statement said the city had received contributions of
$1,400 toward the cost of the bed.
   Earlier, Scardino said materials for the headboard cost $1,400
and that it was paid for by the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, a
private, nonprofit organization. Labor cost should have added up to
an additional ``few hundred dollars at most,'' Scardino said.
   The headboard was built by Anthony Russo, a carpenter on the
staff of the city's Human Resources Administration, Newsweek said.
   He has submitted bills for 266 hours of labor at a cost to date
of $6,484.12, according to a work order obtained by Newsweek. Two
HRA sources told Newsweek the complete job is expected to total 500
hours - at a cost of $23 an hour, or $11,500.
   The Dinkinses chose a cherrywood set and bought nightstands and
bureaus from a private company with their own money for $8,000,
officials said. The matching headboard had been discontinued by the
company so the conservancy agreed to buy the materials to build
one.
   Scardino speculated the bill that Newsweek obtained might
actually have been for a series of jobs.
   ``It's possible this bill represents many jobs, that's the only
way to explain it, because there's no possible way the labor cost
of the headboard could be more than the rest of the furniture
bought for the room,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Commerce Department Issued Questionable Export Licenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the past several years, the U.S. Commerce
Department approved export licenses for American companies to ship
technology to Iraq that could be used against U.S. troops, a
newspaper reported.
   The Commerce Department was largely unhindered in its drive to
promote trade with South Africa, Libya, Iraq and Iran, The
(Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported in articles Sunday and today.
   Pentagon and other government officials with expertise about
weapons and national security interests were routinely kept in the
dark about many U.S.-made exports they say now threaten American
troops, the newspaper reported.
   ``If the exports are in the gray area of dual use, chances are
we don't even know about it,'' said William N. Rudman, the
Pentagon's deputy undersecretary for trade security policy.
   If the Pentagon has suspicions about a deal, it has no legal
authority to stop the shipment; it would be up to the State
Department to do so, he said.
   ``They (Commerce Department) wanted to push as much stuff out
the door as they could,'' said Stephen Bryen, a former Pentagon
trade security official.
   The newspaper said that from 1984 until just months before
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the Commerce Department
approved at least 15 licenses to export tens of millions of dollars
in equipment and technology that intelligence specialists believe
could be used to help pack Iraq's arsenals.
   Among the licenses were ones allowing U.S. businesses to sell
Iraq mainframe computers useful in designing and plotting the
course of missiles, and to sell furnaces that could melt and cast
nuclear materials.
   The newspaper said that in 1987, the Commerce Department agreed
to allow a New Jersey company, Electronics Associates Inc., to sell
a half-million-dollar analog computer system to Iraq. It was
similar to one at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The
company's brochure had a photo of a missile on the cover.
   The Pentagon's office of national trade security protested the
sale, but the computer was shipped anyway, the newspaper said.
   At least twice, executives at another New Jersey company,
Consarc Corp., themselves raised the possibility that Iraq intended
to buy the company's furnaces and computers for nuclear purposes
instead of for their stated purposes of making knee joints and
artificial hips.
   In July, just as the furnace was about to be loaded onto a ship
in Philadelphia, President Bush blocked the shipment.
   Paul Freedenberg, former head of export controls for the
Commerce Department, defended the department's decisions, saying
that too-zealous blocking of exports would erode the United States'
competitive edge and that Iran, South Africa or others would get
the product from another country such as Germany.
   ``I don't have any regrets,'' said Freedenberg. ``I don't
remember any particular export I have second thoughts about.''
   Still, he conceded that ``if it turns out Iraq's an enemy,
obviously (the Pentagon will) have been proven right'' in its
objections. But at the time, there was no legal justification to
deny the export licenses, Freedenberg said.

<HEAD>Central Committee Holds First Meeting Since July Party Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee today opened
its first meeting since July's party congress, with the nation's
worsening economy a major topic, Tass reported.
   The committee's meeting comes as the party is losing its
authority and membership.
   Earlier this year, the party surrendered its constitutional
monopoly on power. Prominent members such as Russian Federation
Boris N. Yeltsin and the mayors of Moscow and Leningrad have quit,
the republics are exercising more independence from the Kremlin,
and the Soviet president and party leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is
transferring much of his power to the government.
   Tass said that participants in today's meeting included the more
than 400 members of the Central Committee; the party's Central
Control Commission; party leaders from the 15 Soviet republics;
territorial, regional and district party officials; academics and
national legislators.
   In July, the 28th party congress expanded the Central Committee
from 249 to 412 members, most of them centrists like Gorbachev.
   Today's session was likely to provide clues as to what role the
Central Committee will play in the changing Soviet Union.
   Tass also said the move to a market economy was expected to
dominate today's meeting.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda carried an article by Ruben
Safarov, a participant in July's congress, who suggested that the
party may have to leave the political arena if it keeps its old
methods of operation.
   The party also has been openly criticized by radical groups
seeking their share of power. On Sunday, in the western Siberian
city of Krasnoyarsk, hundreds of people gathered and shouted
anti-Communist slogans, such as ``God, rid us of the Communist
Party!'' according to local activist Anatoly Popov.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature has set up a committee to combine
several programs on rescuing the Soviet economy and report back by
Oct. 15.
   The most radical reform proposal, written by economist Stanislav
Shatalin, calls for junking the central planning system and moving
to a market economy within 500 days by selling factories to private
owners and breaking up collective farms.
   The most conservative proposal, backed by Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, would leave the government in control of most of the
economy while moving gradually to allow free enterprise.
   Gorbachev has backed a compromise that contains many elements of
the 500-day plan but would not move as fast. He also wants a
national referendum to decide whether to return land to private
farmers.
   On Sunday, Grbachev met with leading economists to discuss the
economic plans under consideration, Tass reported.
   Gorbachev opened today's plenum with a speech, and his deputy,
Vladimir Ivashko, also gave a report, Tass said. It did not provide
details.
   The Communist Party has lost more than 765,000 members this
year, leaving it with about 18 million members, party personnel
chief Boris Pugo has reported.
   Some 375,000 members have followed Yeltsin and other reformers
in quitting the party, another 125,000 members were expelled,
120,000 died and 150,000 stopped paying their membership dues or
participating in party activities.

   A single-engine airplane came down on a
highway, skidded into a ditch and burst into flames, killing four
people, officials said.
   The Beechcraft Bonanza struck the ground Sunday night on the
south side of U.S. 224, about four miles east of Ottawa in
northwest Ohio, said Putnam County Sheriff Ron Diemer.
   The plane skidded across the highway, narrowly missing two
trucks, and came to a stop in the ditch and caught fire, officials
said.
   Diemer said the drivers of the two trucks contacted police.
``They were about 100 feet from the where the plane crashed,'' he
said.
   Authorities speculated the craft may have been making an
approach to the Putnam County airport. They said rainy, foggy
weather may have played a role in the crash.
   The plane was registered in the name of Nelson Manufacturing Co.
of Ottawa, said company spokesman, George Rellinger.
   The cause of the crash wasn't determined immediately.
Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board were
called to the scene.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 13 grafs to UPDATE with Cabinet to dissolve
according to tradition, Vranitzky meets Waldheim. Pickup 12th pvs,
`The Socialists...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky remained in a
position today to rebuild his broad coalition government, but a
charismatic populist campaigning on a nationalist platform scored
big gains in national elections.
   Vranitzky defied predictions of large losses for his Socialist
Party in Sunday's vote. But his conservative partner, the People's
Party, suffered the worst electoral setback of its 45-year history.
   Joerg Haider's populist Freedom Party nearly doubled its
parliamentary representation on the strength of his appeals to
nationalist sentiments, warnings of rising crime, and complaints
over Austria's relatively liberal immigration policies for Eastern
Europeans.
   The Socialists consider Haider's party too far to the right to
be considered a governing partner, and the 53-year-old Vranitzky
offered to join with the People's Party in another governing
coalition.
   Voters seemed to prefer personalities to parties, reflecting
widespread dissatisfaction with bureaucracy, corruption and party
privileges.
   ``It was a vote for the chancellor,'' said the Socialist Party
chief secretary, Josef Cap, in assessing the result.
   Vranitzky led a campaign largely focused on his continuing role
as head of government. His popularity appeared responsible for his
success, despite a series of scandals involving Socialist officials
tampering with public funds.
   According to final results, the Socialists won 43 percent of the
popular vote and 81 seats in the 183-seat parliament, one more than
in the last elections in 1986.
   The People's Party, led by Vice Chancellor Josef Riegler,
suffered losses in each of the country's nine provinces, dropping
to 60 seats from 77.
   Haider's Freedom Party nearly doubled its seats from 18 to 33,
winning almost 17 percent of the popular vote.
   The environmental Green Alternative Party won an additional seat
for a total of nine.
   Vranitzky's government was to submit its resignation Tuesday
after the regular Cabinet session. According to longstanding
tradition, President Kurt Waldheim will ask Vranitzky, as leader of
the strongest party, to form a new government.
   The chancellor met with Waldheim today, as did Peoples' Party
leader Josef Riegler to discuss the outcome of the elections.
   The Socialists' showing amounted to a victory for their party
after ollsters predicted heavy losses for both governing parties.
   But the relatively low turnout of 83 percent of the 5,628,912
registered voters suggested that many Austrians are unhappy with
the status quo. Turnout in 1986 was 90 percent.
   Haider, 40, appealed to voters seeking change after 45 years of
governing by either the Socialists or the People's Party. He lashed
into government bureaucracy, special advantages for party members,
corruption, and sometimes other political leaders.
   Green leader Johannes Voggenhuber attributed some of the
Socialists' success to Vranitzky's clear ``no'' to governing with
Haider and to his conservative partner's failure to clearly rule
out that possibility.
   He said the Peoples' Party had thus ``committed political
suicide on an open stage.''
   Haider said his party intended to remain in the political
opposition, saying it would be ``good for Austria'' to have a
medium-sized party opposing the government.
   He attributed his party's strong gains in this country of 7.6
million people to its role as a ``successful opposition'' in the
past legislative period.
   Helmut Kukacka, the People's Party general secretary, called it
a ``heavy, depressing defeat.'' He acknowledged, ``We are certainly
the big losers.''
   The conservatives still bear the burden of their support four
years ago for Waldheim, who is accused of concealing his World War
II past. Waldheim was not considered a major issue in this
campaign, however.

   An Italian artist has claimed in his will
that he was the author of a painting previously attributed to
Leonardo da Vinci and estimated to be worth millions of dollars.
   The claim was made by Cesare Tubino, who died in this northern
city last week at the age of 91, the Turin daily Stampa Sera
reported Monday.
   ``If the painting is ever sold, it must carry my name,''
Tubino's will read, according to Stampa Sera. A relative of Tubino,
Elio Pretolani, confirmed the newspaper story.
   The ``Madonna with Cat'' first surfaced in the 1930s and was
shown at a prestigious Milan exhibition in 1939 after several
experts attributed it to the 15th century master.
   But it disappeared soon after, and was believed to have been
stolen or lost. It was found in Tubino's apartment after his death.
   Stampa Sera wrote that Tubino used the style and the original
colors of Leonardo and succeeded in creating the conditions of
aging to trick the experts.

   Robbers handcuffed and chained a security
guard, shot him in the neck and stole more than 90 sacks of mail
from a post office, police said Monday.
   A co-worker found the guard Sunday and took him to a hospital,
where doctors removed the bullet and said his life was not in
danger.
   Police said at least three robbers participated in the break-in,
which occurred Saturday night but was not discovered until 12 hours
later.
   The guard, Vladimir Korade, 44, was found with his feet in
chains and his wrists bound by his own handcuffs. No details were
disclosed about the contents or value of the stolen sacks.
   The incident came a week after a robbery at a postal center in
the Mediterranean port city of Toulon, about 110 miles east of
Nimes. In July, robbers stopped a train near Nimes and made off
with large quantities of mail from two freight cars. No arrests
have been made in either case.

   A boat carrying Sri Lankan refugees
capsized off India's south coast Monday and 67 people were feared
drowned, news reports said.
   Indian authorities confirmed the disaster but said they were
awaiting a report on casualties.
   United News of India reported that 11 survivors swam to shore in
the Pudukottai district and reported that their boat carrying 78
people had sunk. A search was on for the missing passengers, it
said.
   On Sunday, another refugee boat capsized, killing 11 people,
refugee authorities said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Since July, 119,000 Tamils have fled Sri Lanka, where Tamil
rebels are fighting government forces. The rebels are seeking an
independent homeland for the minority Tamils, claiming ethnic
discrimanation by the Sinhalese-dominated government.

   Wanton destruction of forests in
Vietnam has put 226 species of flora and fauna in danger of
extinction, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
   Statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, although incomplete,
show that the threatened species include 104 bird and animal
species, 100 plant species, and 22 species of amphibians and
reptiles, the report said.
   Most of the species are very rare, including cedar trees and a
species of kingwood tree, as well as the rhinoceros, kouprey,
leopard, pheasant, and a species of crane, said the report dated
Sunday and seen in Bangkok Monday.
   It said 17.2 million acres of forest have been destroyed in
recent decades, and only 28 percent of the country's former natural
greenery remains.

<TEXT>
   A 13-foot crocodile attacked a family
sleeping in a tent, mauling a woman until her son stuck his fingers
into its eyes, the son said Monday.
   ``It was something my father had told me to do if we were ever
attacked,'' Peter Pangquee said.
   Lena Pangquee, 55, was in serious but stable condition in Royal
Darwin Hospital. She was attacked by the crocodile as she tried to
protect her partly incapacitated husband.
   Mrs. Pangquee, her 55-year-old husband and their 35-year-old son
had accompanied other family members on a camping and fishing trip
to an isolated creek about 120 miles south of Darwin in far
northern Australia.
   The younger Pangquee, who had accompanied his father on previous
crocodile-hunting expeditions, said the crocodile attacked Saturday
night as he, his mother and father and three teen-age family
members were asleep in a 13-foot-square mosquito shelter.
   ``I was sleeping at my mother and father's feet when I heard my
mother yell out,'' Pangquee said. ``I jumped up and saw the
crocodile rip straight through the mesh.
   ``It came in from my parents' side, and my mother could see it
was going for dad. He's been left weak down one side after having a
stroke, and she just threw herself between him and the croc.
   ``She was was pulling him out of the way when the croc grabbed
her around the body.
   ``It all happened so quick, but I just went for the croc's head.
I must have stuck my fingers about an inch into its eyes, and it

   When a slum in the nation's second-largest
city burst into violence last week, a raw sore was exposed in this
country proud of its social order and growing affluence.
   During the nearly weeklong street violence in the Airin district
that eased Sunday, the face of a largely hidden underclass finally
emerged. It is a group of outcasts who feel abused by the rest of
society, particularly the police and gangsters who so closely
monitor their lives.
   ``You can never understand this feeling,'' a 50-year-old laborer
lying on a park bench shouted at a visitor during the height of the
rioting. ``How do you know what it is like to be treated like the
dregs of society? Everyone treats us as if we are less than human,
so go away!''
   Airin - which means ``love your neighbor'' - is considered
Japan's largest slum. More than 90 percent of its 25,000 residents
are day laborers.
   At first glance, the district looks like an ordinary
neighborhood. But on closer examination, one quickly discovers
Airin is a world apart from the rest of Japan.
   Drunken men sleep on the dirty streets; the stench of urine and
garbage is pervasive. Barracks made of cardboard boxes fill the
local park; shabby hotels that charge $7.70 a night do a booming
business.
   Airin's day laborers are among the poorest people in this
economic superpower, supplying the manpower for local construction
jobs. They are Japan's unfortunates: farmers and businessmen who
went bust, minorities facing discrimination, family outcasts and
ex-convicts.
   Reports that a police official was suspected of taking $84,600
in bribes from gangsters who control the labor market touched off
the riot.
   Angered workers, who see themselves as victims of both police
and the gangsters, quickly massed in front of the local police
station and were soon stoning police.
   In following days, the crowds set fire to automobiles, looted
stores and waged pitched street battles with the 2,500 riot police
in violence rarely seen in Japan. Nearly 200 people, mostly police,
were injured. More than 50 were arrested. Airin was quiet for a
second day Monday.
   Allegations of police corruption in Osaka are not unusual, but
the Airin residents are particularly angered by allegations of
police collusion with the gangsters, known as yakuza, who control
the daily recruiting of laborers for construction companies.
   Sen Arimura, who works at the district's Job Placement Center,
says part of the money construction company's allot for workers'
salary, which is usually no more than minimum wage, eventually
winds up in the pockets of recruiters, many of whom belong to the
mob.
   For example, laborers often spend much of their earnings on
gambling, a stronghold of the yakuza, and end up with huge debts.
   Many of the popular cheap bars and pachinko parlors - the
Japanese version of pinball halls - in the area are also run by
gangsters.
   Police report that with about 40 offices run by gangsters, Airin
is considered a high-crime district.
   In response, police have set up 24-hour ``crime prevention''
surveillance cameras at 16 locations. The system infuriates Airin
residents, who say the close surveillance invades their privacy.
   ``People in this town are extremely sensitive about their
privacy because most of them have hidden pasts that they do not
want to be revealed,'' said a coffee shop owner who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Do you know the feeling when you are consistently watched?''
Arimura asked. ``Here, police seem to assume that everyone is a
potential criminal. What can be more discouraging?''
   Laborers also complain that police do not investigate complaints
that gangsters are taking advantage of the workers.
   ``It's as if we are lower than gangsters,'' one laborer said.
``When I heard about the bribery case, I felt like shouting that it
was our money the cop was getting from gangs, and he was helping
those gangs exploit us.''
   Said another middle-aged worker: ``We are outcasts of society
who got kicked out of the ordinary world and ended up here. We are
being sandwiched between police and gangsters. But where else can
we go now?''

   After restoring some of NASA's
credibility with a successful launch and deployment of the Ulysses
sun probe, Discovery's crew tended to experiments today and beamed
down a birthday greeting for one of the astronaut's wives.
   The men sang ``Happy Birthday'' to Kaye Akers, wife of astronaut
Tom Akers. In lieu of a candle, they held up a reflective plastic
stick used aboard the shuttle as a light source.
   ``We don't have a birthday cake on board,'' said Discovery's
commander Richard N. Richards. ``NASA doesn't let us start fires
except for Tom. He's the only one who's been able to start an
authorized fire.''
   Richards was referring to Sunday's experiment involving a small,
controlled fire aboard the shuttle. Akers conducted the test.
   Richards joked that Mrs. Akers was celebrating her 25th birthday
again. Mrs. Akers, whose real age was not available to NASA, is
mother of two children, a 13-year-old son and a 10-year-old
daughter.
   Mission Control's Kathy Thornton told the crew following their
rendition of ``Happy Birthday'' that ``I don't think the New Kids
in Space are going to replace the New Kids on the Block as the teen
hearthrobs, but we appreciate it anyway.''
   ``We know we weren't competing with anybody, but that's the best
we can do,'' Richards replied.
   Ulysses, meanwhile, raced across the solar system on its
five-year roundabout journey to explore the sun's poles. The
plutonium-powered craft was traveling at a record-breaking speed of
34,130 mph.
   Achieving a polar orbit around the sun will let scientists study
the sun from a previously unexplored vantage point.
   Its deployment and Discovery's spectacular blastoff this weekend
renewed the space agency's spirits, shaken in recent months by
failed launch attempts, nagging hydrogen leaks and the flawed
Hubble Space Telescope.
   The crew of five astronauts were awakened early today with the
U.S. Coast Guard hymn, radioed to them from Mission Control. The
wake-up call came at about 1:45 a.m. EDT.
   It was played in honor of this year's 200th anniversary of the
Coast Guard and because mission specialist Bruce Melnick is the
first Coast Guard officer to fly in space.
   ``Good morning, Houston,'' Richards said.
   The crew then went about their early morning duties, which
included an hour of exercise. They are scheduled to stay in orbit
until a Wednesday morning landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   The Saturday morning blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the
first shuttle launch in nearly six months. The Columbia and
Atlantis shuttles have been grounded since early summer by the
hydrogen leaks.
   At Kennedy Space Center, NASA started preparing for the next
shuttle launch. The crippled Columbia was being moved from one
launch pad to the other today, so Atlantis can be transported from
the hangar to the vacated pad.
   NASA was embarrassed when workers left a 70-pound beam inside
the engine compartment of Atlantis last week. The beam had caused
minor damage when it banged around as the shuttle was lifted into
an upright position.
   But NASA officials did not expect it to delay Atlantis'
early-November liftoff by more than or so when the shuttle is set
to embark on a secret military mission.
   Six hours after Discovery's launch and without a hitch, the five
crew members dispatched Ulysses into space.
   With the mission's primary goal behind them on the first day,
astronauts have since turned their attention to various scientific
and medical experiments aboard the orbiter.
   ``It's going real well. We've accomplished the main objective
that is to deploy Ulysses, and the other objectives are going
smoothly,'' flight director Gary Coen said today. ``We're all happy
we've gotten back into the air in this fashion.''
   Later this morning, mission specialist Bill Shepherd began
another test of an experimental system using voice commands to
control television cameras. The astronauts met with little success
when they first tested it in space Sunday.
   NASA television showed pictures of Shepherd working with the
experiment, which is designed to give astronauts the opportunity to
do more than one thing at a time by freeing them from manually
operating the cameras.
   Prior to launch, Melnick and Shepherd recorded simple commands
onto computer chips to control the cameras before blastoff. Melnick
had better luck Sunday than Shepherd, who even reprogrammed the
system with the sound of his voice in space.
   Shepherd had problems today and decided to reprogram the system
once more.
   ``It's going a little better than yesterday, but it's still not
optimum for controlling the cameras with this kind of
recognition,'' he told Mission Control.
   But the system still failed to recognize about nine of his
commands and so Shepherd turned the test over to Melnick, who only
had trouble with two words.
   The system will be tested again Monday. Mission Control
suggested that next time, Shepherd speak a litte louder and closer
to the microphone used in the experiment.
   In another shuttle first, the astronauts Sunday started a small
fire aboard the orbiter as part of an experiment to study the
spread of flames in space.
   As cameras recorded the experiment, the fire burned about 70
seconds within a sealed aluminum container. Shuttle safety managers
wanted to observe how fire acts in the absence of Earth's gravity.
   The astronauts Sunday also extended Discovery's 50-foot-long
robot arm for another experiment. Two patches of material identical
to that on solar panels of a communications satellite are attached
to the arm.
   The $157-million satellite has been stranded in a low Earth
orbit since March, when it failed to separate properly from an
unmanned Titan rocket.
   Intelsat, an organization of countries that owns the satellite,
wants to measure how much the same kind of material on the
satellite will decay in space before NASA sends up astronauts in
early 1992 to repair the craft.
   ``Provided the results from this experiment are not wildly
different from what we expect, it will be the final piece of data
that gives us the confidence to go ahead and rescue the
spacecraft,'' said Intelsat scientist Andrew Dunnet.

   Leftist rebels attacked
army troops and prison guards at a penitentiary here, killing one
soldier and wounding seven, authorities said today.
   The Mariona prison holds many political prisoners and
guerrillas.
   The assault with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and rifle
fire began Sunday night at the prison five miles north of the San
Salvador and continued until shortly after mdnight. Air force
helicopters overflew the battle and dropped flares to illuminate
the area but did not fire.
   The army authorities who reported the government casualties said
no dead guerrillas had been found as of mid-morning today.
   The explosions and gunfire roused many residents of the
capital's northern sector. Army troops in light tanks and armored
vehicles were out in strength this morning patrolling the capital's
northern outskirts.

   For many Cuban commuters, getting to work
these days means riding a bicycle instead of a bus, one of many
hardships resulting from declining Soviet oil deliveries to the
island.
   With economic ties shrinking, and their respective ideologies no
longer in harmony, Soviet-Cuban relations are facing greater
uncertainty now than at any time in more than two decades,
according to U.S. and Cuban experts.
   Although official relations remain cordial, there has been a
sharp reduction in economic ties, particularly Soviet fuel exports
to the island, forcing President Fidel Castro to impose
increasingly draconian austerity measures.
   The economic hard times in Cuba have prompted widespread
speculation among diplomats that the Cuban revolution's days may be
numbered. But Cuban officials point out that, despite the
difficulties, there has been no serious challenge to Castro's
legitimacy.
   When Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev began implementing
radical changes several years ago, many experts wondered whether
the Soviets would decide to cut assistance to Cuba, estimated by
the U.S. government to be $5 billion annually in economic aid alone
during much of the previous decade.
   Now, with the Soviet economy itself facing a crisis, the
question has shifted.
   ``The issue is more one of Soviet capacities than of Soviet
intentions,'' says Cole Blasier, chief of the Hispanic Division at
the Library of Congress.
   Curiously, Castro seems to agree. ``Has the USSR wanted to harm
us?'' Castro asked in a speech late last month. ``No, the Soviet
government has made every effort - and I say this with all honesty
- to fulfill the supplies we agreed on.''
   The Soviet-Cuban relationship has changed dramatically from the
pre-Gorbachev era when the friendship of the two countries seemed
unshakable.
   Starting about two decades ago, Cuba willingly lent itself to
Soviet strategic objectives, sending troops by the tens of
thousands to support pro-Soviet governments in Africa and
elsewhere. In return, the Soviets lavished more aid on Cuba than
any other country, shelling out premium prices for imports of Cuban
sugar, citrus and nickel. According to the Soviet media, Cuba's
debt to Moscow is about $24 billion.
   In the past, economic agreements were reached well in advance of
target dates, leaving both countries ample time to gear up for
their implementation. In his speech last month, Castro commented on
how much things have changed lately.
   ``To date, we do not know what the basis of our trade with the
USSR will be next year,'' Castro said. ``No one knows how much they
are going to pay for our sugar, for our products. What price are we
going to be charged for the products supplied by the USSR? What
amount of fuel are we going to receive? No one knows at this time,
although practically only three months remain before the end of the
year.''
   The Soviet deficit in fuel deliveries to Cuba is more than 2
million metric tons this year, prompting Castro to impose severe
energy saving measures. Among the economic projects which have been
sacrificed for lack of fuel are a nickel plant, a thermoelectric
power plant and an oil refinery.
   The government has asked citizens to cut monthly household
electricity use by 10 per cent. Supplies of gasoline for private
motorists have been reduced by 30 per cent.
   Fuel shortages have forced the cancellation of many bus routes.
Cuban authorities have responded by importing thousands of bicycles
and distributing them to workers throughout Havana.
   Adding to the uncertainty is the Soviets' stated intention to
shift foreign economic relations from an ideological to an economic
basis starting in January. Some in the Kremlin, however, argue that
Cuba deserves special consideration because of Castro's long years
of loyalty to the Soviets.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said last month after a visit to the
Soviet Union that he envisions no reversal of the decline in
Soviet-Cuban relations.
   ``The Soviets have clearly concluded that Fidel Castro is no
longer a luxury that they can afford,'' Graham said. ``Particularly
as he grows further and further away from their objectives of
glasnost and perestroika.''

<TEXT>
   An organization that sent $3 million worth of
gift packages to servicemen in Vietnam is cranking up to ship
Christmas packages to American soldiers in the Persian Gulf.
   Roger Chapin, president of Help Hospitalized Veterans, said his
goal is to raise enough money to send 250,000 packages, enough for
every American serving in Operation Desert Shield.
   Chapin said the packages will have a retail value of at least
$15, including packaging and shipping, and will contain nuts,
cookies, dates, raisins, hard candies and other treats.
   Each package will include a Christmas card from the donor, along
with a return card for the recipient to send.
   Chapin said the cost to the donor for one package would be $15.
Two can be sponsored for $25, four for $50, six for $75 and eight
for $100.
   People wishing to donate may call 1-800-755-GIFT (or
1-800-755-4438) from Oct. 14 to Nov. l5, or may send a check or
money order to ``G.I. Christmas Gift Pac'' at P.O. Box 91560,
Washington, D.C. 20090.
   ``This will be the ideal vehicle for Americans to demonstrate
their care and appreciation as well as their solidarity and support
to our troops in the Persian Gulf,'' Chapin said.
   Help Hospitalized Veterans is an offshoot of Vietnam Gift Pac,
which Chapin, a former San Diego real estate developer, founded in
1967 after a chance meeting with a Navy corpsman wounded in
Vietnam.
   The organization raised money to package and ship gift packages,
each containing $9.12 worth of 28 personal items, including
medicated foot powder, instant lemonade to flavor foul-tasting
water and first aid cream for jungle sores.
   Chapin, an Army veteran, founded Help Hospitalized Veterans in
1970. The non-profit organization provides hospitalized veterans
with arts and crafts kits.
   In a related development, the Postal Service urged Americans
mailing Christmas gifts to service personnel in the gulf region to
mail early.
   ``With the military build-up in Saudi Arabia, we're expecting a
big strain to be placed on our mail transportation system
worldwide,'' said Allen Kane, assistant postmaster general for
delvery, distribution and transportation.
   The Postal Service said that to ensure timely delivery to the
Middle East, air parcels should be mailed by Nov. 16, letters and
cards by Nov. 26, parcel airlift mail by Nov. 10 and
space-available mail by Nov. 3.

   Fishing for Atlantic striped bass will be
prohibited in most federal waters starting Nov. 1, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced.
   Harvest and possession of striped bass will be banned in federal
waters extending from 3 miles to 200 miles off shore. The only
exception is an area of Block Island Sound, Rhode Island, where
fishermen will be permitted to transport to the mainland bass taken
legally in state waters at Block Island.
   The regulations are intended to protect the striped bass, which
is slowly recovering from a severe decline in the 1970s and early
1980s, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service said.
   Taking of striped bass in state waters is subject to varying
regulation.

   U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston won a fourth
term, but former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke says his
strong showing may translat into the beginning of a national
political agenda.
   Or maybe a run at the Louisiana governorship.
   Duke claimed 44 percent of the vote in Saturday's race against
Johnston, a Democrat who had always been easily re-elected.
   ``I'm very committed to making political changes in this state
and in this country. I've got to be very encouraged by this
election,'' Duke said at a news conference Sunday. ``I want to move
forward. I want to make an impact. I want to make a difference.''
   Johnston, who got 54 percent of the vote, said he ``got the
message'' from the more than 600,000 people who voted for Duke, but
he added that he would not become more conservative, claiming much
of Duke's showing was the result of rocky economic times in
Louisiana.
   During the bitter campaign, Duke attacked affirmative action,
forced busing and welfare abuse. He also attacked Johnston for
playing a key role in the Senate campaign to reject conservative
Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and for backing the 1990 Civil
Rights Act.
   ``I knew David Duke had a tremendous appeal. There's frustration
out there. When people are unemployed and underemployed, it's easy
to blame it on someone else,'' Johnston said. ``It's easy to blame
on affirmative action.''
   Complete but unofficial returns gave Johnston 749,552 votes, or
54 percent, and Duke 605,681 votes, or 44 percent. Two minor
Democratic candidates split the remainder. Nick Accardo had 21,709
votes and Larry Crowe had 14,472 votes.
   Ed Renwick of Loyola University's Institute of Politics said
Duke, a member of the state Legislature, may have lost the
election, but gained national attention.
   ``You don't win elections with 44 percent, but it makes a lot of
politicians sit up and take notice,'' he said.
   On Sunday, Duke backed off of his announced plan to go to court
over absentee ballots cast but not counted for state Sen. Ben
Bagert, the official Republican nominee.
   Bagert dropped out two days before Saturday's primary amid
pressure from national GOP leaders who feared that his candidacy
would force a runoff between Johnston and the maverick Republican
Duke.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, all candidates run
against each other in the primary, regardless of party. If no one
gets more than 50 percent, those finishing first and second face
each other in a runoff.
   Bagert withdrew too late to get his name off the ballot. Under a
1981 law, his votes could not be counted, but some were because it
was too late to change computer programs or courthouse operations.
Those reported to The Associated Press gave Bagert 10,536 votes -
less than 1 percent of the 1.4 million cast.
   Although Bagert said dropping out was his idea, Duke called the
withdrawal a political deal and a dirty trick. Johnston got the
unprecedented cross-party endorsement of eight Republican senators
and Jack Kemp, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Duke said he was studying a possible run for Louisiana governor
in 1991. Such a race would require him to give up his state House
seat, which he won in a special election in 1989.
   ``I think that (Gov.) Buddy Roemer better be sobered up to the
fact that we received well over 100,000 more votes than he received
for the governorship,'' Duke said.
   Roemer said today he wasn't worried about Duke.
   ``Time takes care of a lot of things,'' the governor said. ``My
job is to take care of this state.''
   There also has been speculation that Duke might seek a U.S.
House seat in 1992, probably from one of the north Louisiana
districts where he polled heavily on Saturday.
   In other races, New Orleans was assured of having its first
black congressman since Reconstruction when state Sen. William
Jefferson and Marc Morial, both Democrats, qualified for a Nov. 6
runoff.
   By a 2-1 margin, voters also approved Louisiana's first lottery
since a corrupt private lottery was shut down by Congress in the
late 1890s.
   New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick, who was acquitted
earlier this year of federal charges stemming from the return of a
bookmaker's records, easily won re-election over two opponents.
Connick is the father of Harry Connick Jr., a Grammy Award-winning
musician.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party opens its annual conference Tuesday ringed by a
spiked fence and sharpshooters, while police warned she faces a
grave risk of an assassination attempt.
   The unprecedented security for her arrival Monday evening in
this south England seaside resort followed a spate of Irish
Republican Army attacks this year, including the July 30 car bomb
killing of a close political aide.
   ``This year I see it (the threat to Mrs. Thatcher) personally as
extremely high,'' said Dorset County deputy police chief, Alan
Rose, who headed the $3.94-million security operation.
   The four-day conference, which may be the last time Mrs.
Thatcher rallies her trailing Conservatives before she calls a
general election, was buoyed by a booming pound and
government-inspired hopes of lower interest rates.
   The jaunty mood, which many warned may not last, was sparked by
Britain's entry Monday of the pound into the mechanism which links
other major European currencies.
   Mrs. Thatcher made the surprise announcement late Friday shortly
before early arrivals among the some 10,000 people - including
delegates, journalists and police reinforcements - began assembling
in Bournemouth.
   Many commentators regarded the move by Mrs. Thatcher as playing
her last ace to try to pull the economy back from the edge of
recession and damp both interest rates and inflation to give her a
better-than-even chance of winning again.
   ``...It has been a very difficult year for us,'' Tory party
chairman Kenneth Baker acknowledged Monday, referring to the
party's 18-month lag in opinion poll ratings behind the socialist
Labor Party.
   Gallup and Market Opinion and Research International polls
published over the weekend and on Monday showed the Tories 12 to
14.5 points behind Labor, which had its conference last week.
   Earlier polls showed the Labor lead down to around nine points.
   Mrs. Thatcher, whose ratings appear to be benefiting from her
robust response to the Persian Gulf crisis, must call an election
by June 1992. But she may do so at any time when she thinks she has
the best chance of winning.
   Mrs. Thatcher linked sterling to the Exchange Rate Mechanism of
the European Monetary System although British inflation at 10.6
percent is nearly twice the average of the 12-nation European
Community. She said, among other things, that it was an
antiinflationary measure.
   Britain's interest rates fell one point to 14 percent Monday,
and government officials predicted drops in both interest rates and
inflation early next year.
   The six-feet high fence, the first ever put up at a British
political party conference, snaked three miles around the seafront
convention center and the Highcliff Hotel, where leading party
members were staying.
   Some 1,500 police, including nearly 1,000 drafted in from forces
in a dozen other counties, and unspecified military units guarded
this sedate resort 108 miles southwest of London.
   Sharpshooters were posted on roof tops, a 5,500-foot air
exclusion zone was imposed from dawn Saturday and naval vessels
were due to patrol offshore during the conference.
   Security at the governing party's annual conferences has been
stepped up since the outlawed IRA detonated a bomb at the hotel
where Mrs. Thatcher was staying during the 1984 conference in
nearby Brighton. She escaped, but five party members were killed
and 31 injured, and the IRA vowed to try again.
   The IRA, a mainly Roman Catholic organization, is fighting to
end British rule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite
the province with the Irish Republic under a leftist
administration.
   The spate of IRA attacks in England this year has roused new
fears.
   Attacks include the July 30 killing of Conservative lawmaker Ian
Gow and a foiled attempt Sept. 27 to assassinate Foreign Office
Minister William Waldegrave by taping a bomb to the speaker's
lectern at a London conference.
   Police said Monday they were looking for a 21-year-old Belfast
man who worked as a kitchen porter at the Royal Overseas League
Club, where the bomb was planted, but has not been seen since Sept.
27.

<HEAD>Western Michigan University Gets $5 Million for Teacher Evaluation
Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Michigan University has received
a $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to
establish a national center to improve evaluation methods for
educators, officials announced Monday.
   The grant, the largest in the university's history, will
establish the Center for Research on Educational Accountability on
Nov. 1 within the university's existing Evaluation Center.
   The center will become the focal point for efforts to improve
measurement procedures for evaluating the performance of teachers
and administrators in both public and private schools.
   ``Personnel evaluation has always been something of a hot
potato,'' said Daniel L. Stufflebeam, who will serve as the
center's director.
   Public demand for accountability has pushed many districts and
even entire states to adopt misguided teacher evaluation methods,
he said. A goal of the center will be to provide schools with
evaluation models that are unbiased and efficient.
   Western was selected for the grant after a six-month nationwide
competition. The center $1 million in federal funds annually for
five years.

<HEAD>Trial Begins for White Supremacist Facing $10 Million Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD GREEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White supremacist Tom Metzger arrived in
court today to defend himself against a $10 million lawsuit
alleging he incited the bludgeoning death of a black man.
   Metzger, of Fallbrook, Calif., founded White Aryan Resistance
and is a former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon. He is acting as his own
attorney in the trial before a black judge, Ancer Haggerty of
Multnomah County Circuit Court.
   The lawsuit accuses Metzger of sending agents to Portland to
advocate violence against blacks shortly before the November 1988
beating death of Mulugeta Seraw, 27.
   Three ``skinheads'' were convicted in Seraw's slaying.
   The trial is the focus of a week's worth of activities planned
by national civil rights organizations. And it has drawn threats
from white supremacists, hundreds of whom reportedly were coming to
town for the proceedings.
   This morning, however, only a handful of skinheads - with shaved
heads and heavy boots - were at the Multnomah County Courthouse.
They were searched and interrogated by police.
   ``We got nothin' to say to you,'' one of them told a reporter.
   Security was tight around the courthouse. An estimated 50
police, many in riot gear and some on horseback, were posted
outside. A police helicopter hovered overhead.
   The street behind the courthouse was closed to traffic, and an
intersection was cleared for Metzger's arrival. He was whisked into
a 6-foot-high metal elevator that rose from the sidewalk and
descended into the courthouse.
   The trial got under way at 10 a.m., half an hour late.
   The lawsuit was filed by Engedaw Berhanu, Seraw's uncle. Berhanu
is represented by attorney Morris Dees of the Alabama-based
Southern Poverty Law Center.
   It cites the legal doctrine of vicarious liability, which holds
that one person or organization can be legally liable for the
actions of another.
   Three years ago, Dees won a $7 million jury verdict against the
United Klans of America after two Klansmen from Mobile, Ala.,
killed a 19-year-old black man.
   Also named in the wrongful death lawsuit are Metzger's son,
John, and two of the three skinheads convicted in Seraw's death.
   Seraw was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steven
Strasser, members of East Side White Pride.
   The three men and their girlfriends drove up as Seraw, an
Ethiopian, was being dropped off by friends.
   ``They deliberately went up there for the purpose of starting a
fight,'' police Detective Tom Nelson said. ``Seraw was defending
himself against Brewster when Mieske came up and blindsided Seraw
with a baseball bat.''
   The blow to the head knocked Seraw to the pavement. Mieske
smashed Seraw's head twice more, splitting the bat lengthwise,
police said.
   Mieske admitted he killed Seraw because he was black. He pleaded
guilty to murder and racial intimidation, Brewster pleaded guilty
to manslaughter and racial intimidation, and Strasser pleaded
guilty to manslaughter.
   Mieske was sentenced to life with a 20-year minimum, Brewster to
10 to 20 years and Strasser to 20 years.
   Despite the confessions, Metzger contends the killing was in
self-defense. ``We've been saying from the beginning that it was
mutual combtt provoked by the Ethiopians,'' he said.

<HEAD>Saddam Turning Kuwait Into Iraqi Backwater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By violence and stealth, Saddam
Hussein is rapidly transforming Kuwait from a glittering emirate to
an Iraqi backwater, diplomats, exiled officials and refugees say.
   ``The Iraqis are doing their best to obliterate Kuwait's
identity and seal it off from the outside,'' said one senior
Western diplomat displaced by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion. ``The world
doesn't realize how successful they are.''
   While noting that no accurate count was possible, he estimated
that hundreds, if not thousands, of Kuwaitis had been put to death.
Some were shot in front of their families. Many others were
deported to Iraq.
   Diplomats and Kuwaiti officials in exile endorsed a recent
Amnesty International report of ``a horrifying picture of
widespread arrests, torture under interrogation, summary executions
and mass extrajudicial killings.''
   Beyond that, the diplomats and officials said, Iraq was carting
off everything from blood supplies in hospitals to traffic lights
and forcing citizens to exchange Kuwaiti papers for Iraqi identity
cards.
   They described a harrowing climate of fear and repression, which
in recent days has triggered another exodus of Kuwaitis into Saudi
Arabia.
   In one incident, a Western diplomat said, Iraqi soldiers shot to
death five hospital workers when doctors told them that a wounded
comrade they brought in was already dead on arrival.
   Saddam has entrusted the dismantling of Kuwait to a relative,
Ali Hassan al Majid, who two years ago commanded a brutal military
campaign that crushed a Kurdish uprising with the help of poison
gas, diplomats said.
   ``That gives some idea of Saddam's thinking,'' one Western
specialist observed.
   As a result of the pressure, Kuwaiti government sources said
they were not encouraging armed resistance which might provoke even
more violence.
   Some 430,000 Iraqi troops reported to be deployed in occupied
Kuwait and southern Iraq outnumber Kuwaitis left in the emirate.
   Few sources were prepared to be named since the Iraqis have
acted on published information from refugees and exiles to target
reprisals, diplomats reported.
   Increased checkpoints and house-to-house search teams are
rooting out suspected dissidents and Westerners on the run.
Intelligence units search bank records and private papers to hunt
down members of the emir's family and former officials.
   Iraq has closed Kuwait not only to journalists but also to the
Red Cross and humanitarian workers.
   Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassim Ramadan, a close aide of
Saddam's, recently denied human rights abuses, then said Iraq would
``cut off the legs'' of anyone trying to enter Kuwait without
permission.
   Accounts by refugees fit together to draw a clear picture of
Iraqi intent.
   ``They've taken almost everything to Iraq,'' said Yusuf al-Ali,
a 25-year-old Kuwaiti Airways pilot who crossed into Saudi Arabia
on Sunday.
   ``You see trucks in front of the big houses. They strip them -
carpets, videos, anything.''
   On a larger scale, technicians have dismantled medical equipment
and research facilities, burned public buildings and looted grain
stocks.
   ``They don't need a lot of the things they're taking,'' said Ali
Abu-Asi, an aide to Kuwait's Crown Prince, Sheik Saad, interviewed
in Taif, Saudi Arabia. ``It's to dominate Kuwait, to humiliate it
and make it just another province of Iraq.''
   Iraqi forces are especailly brutal with anyone representing
authority or anyone suspected of armed resistance, the sources
agreed.
   They said nearly every captured Kuwaiti military and police
officer was either shot on the spot or taken off for days and then
returned to be executed in front of relatives.
   Over the past few weeks, large numbers of Iraqis have settled in
the conquered emirate, either encouraged by Baghdad or drawn by the
chance to grab unprotected property.
   Holdout Western embassies have maintained a defiant, if
symbolic, presence despite Iraqi orders that since Kuwait has been
declared Iraq's 19th province, foreign embassies are no longer
permitted.
   But the diplomats' resources are dwindling fast.
   At the U.S. Embassy, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a
half-dozen other Americans survive by boiling water from the
swimming pool and eating up their last cans of food.
   ``Not one of them's going to look at a tunafish sandwich again
for the rest of his life,'' said one U.S. official in touch with
the embassy.
   Hundreds of thousands of Asian workers remain in Kuwait,
desperately short of food and, in many cases, afraid for their
lives. Hundreds of thousands have left, taking their chances on a
grim odyssey across the desert to Jordan or Iran.
   Several thousand Westerners are still hiding in suburban homes
in Kuwait, waiting for the fateful knock of Iraqi patrols trying to
round them up for Saddam's human shield.
   U.S. officials estimate that Americans now number about 1,000,
one-third of the number who were in Kuwait when Iraq attacked.
   The Amnesty International report said: ``Iraqi forces have
arrested not only people suspected of armed attacks against them,
but men, women and children found with opposition literature, the
Kuwaiti flag or photographs of the emir.''
   It said men were seized at the border and sent to Iraq for
secret detention or military service. The possession of Kuwaiti
flags, opposition literature or even the emir's photo is a capital
offense.
   ``The Amnesty report squares absolutely with what we have, and
what the Kuwaitis here have,'' a veteran diplomat said. ``In fact,
things are even worse than that, but no one can get in to reveal
the details.''

   John Young fears women aren't taking
his approach seriously - he's advertising for a spouse with a sign
on his car.
   ``I've had no takers. Absolutely none,'' the 45-year-old
divorced convenience store manager said Monday. ``Not even a crank
call.''
   For two months he's been driving around with a sticker on his
car trunk reading ``wife wanted'' in block letters, followed by his
telephone number.
   A few women customers at the Pick Kwik noticed the sign and
commented that it was unique, but that was it.
   ``The men scoff at it. They say things like, `What, are you
crazy? I've got one you can have,' '' he said.
   ``I think it's being taken lightly, like a joke, rather than a
serious attempt at making contact,'' said Young, of nearby Largo.
   After four years of marriage, Young was divorced 10 years ago.
He doesn't like singles bars - too artificial and noisy, he said.
Personal advertisements in magazines have drawn responses from
older, seemingly desperate women, not what he has in mind.
   ``I'm pretty much of a homebody. If you're a mid-40s homebody,
alone, what do you do?''
   Young, who describes himself as intelligent, sensitive and
curious, said his ideal woman would be intelligent - ``that's the
first thing'' - with a pretty face. ``And from there on, it's just
a matter of chemistry.''
   What does he have to offer?
   ``I care,'' he said. ``And I'm absolutely serious about it.''

   Two U.S. pilots died in a jet crash
in Saudi Arabia today, and the Navy searched for two helicopters
and eight crew members missing in the North Arabian Sea, military
officials said.
   The officials said the RF4C Phantom reconnaisance jet, belonging
to a unit of the Alabama Air National Guard assigned to Operation
Desert Shield, crashed in the southern Saudi Arabian peninsula
shortly after 1 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT.)
   The names of the pilots were withheld pending notification of
relatives. A military spokesman, Navy Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle, said
he could provide no other details other than that the crash was
being investigated.
   The crash came as Navy search and rescue efforts continued for
eight Marines missing after two UH-1 helicopters vanished during a
training flight in the North Arabian Sea earlier today.
   As night fell, there was no further word on the outcome of the
search.
   Navy officers ruled out hostile action in the incident, which
occurred well outside the Strait of Hormuz leading to the Persian
Gulf, and 500 to 600 miles from where ground forces are deployed in
the Saudi Arabian desert.
   They also said there was no indication the two UH-1 Hueys had
collided in flight as they were returning to the amphibious assault
carrier USS Okinawa.
   In Washington, the Pentagon confirmed there had been no progress
in the search operation. A spokesman said the Marines were from the
Camp Pendelton, Calif. base.
   ``Radar and voice contact was lost'' at 5:13 a.m., van Sickle
said. ``Search and rescue efforts are currently under way.''
   Each helicopter carried two pilots and two crew members. Their
identities were withheld pending completion of the Navy's search in
the North Arabian Sea.
   The U.S. forces were deployed in Saudi Arabia and nearby
waterways after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Since then, seven American military personnel have been killed
in accidents in the Persian Gulf region.
   In addition to the two pilots today, two Air Force F-16 pilots
were killed in a crash Sept. 30, a soldier and a Marine died in
vehicular accidents, and a sailor was electrocuted in an accident
aboard a ship in the Persian Gulf.
   There have been five previous helicopter mishaps, none causing
deaths or serious injuries.
   The worst accident involving U.S. personnel since the gulf
crisis began occurred on Aug. 29 when a giant C-5A transport
aircraft loaded with supplies for U.S. forces in the gulf crashed
and burned in West Germany shortly after takeoff, killing 13 crew
members.

<HEAD>Fourth Cambodian Dancer Seeks Asylum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of a visiting Cambodian dance
troupe has requested political asylum, the fourth member of the
company to do so in its month-long U.S. tour.
   The 22-year-old woman dancer, whose name was not released,
stayed behind after a performance while the remainder of the troupe
continued to its next stop, New York City, on Sunday.
   She was waiting at an undisclosed location to speak with
officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who said
the meeting would be held on Tuesday at the earliest.
   Three other dancers from the troupe, the Cambodian Classical
Dance Company, sought asylum while on a stop in St. Paul, Minn.,
last week.
   Angry organizers of the dance tour charged that Cambodians in
the United States, including members of Lowell's large
Cambodian-American community, coerced the dancers into leaving to
score political points.
   ``What has clearly happened is some of the political groups that
are against the government in Phnom Penh have done the one thing
they can do: pressure the dancers to defect,'' said John McAuliff,
director of the sponsoring U.S.-Indo-China Reconciliation Project
in Philadelphia.
   Cambodian-American activists ``were all over us,'' McAuliff
said. ``It's been clear that they have been trying very hard to
undermine the tour.''
   Cambodians in Lowell and St. Paul acknowledged they encouraged
the defections to protest the government in Phnom Penh.
   ``They call it a cultural performance, but this (dance tour) is
to convince the American people to support the Cambodian
government,'' said Bunthan Eang, editor of the Cambodian Press in
Lowell and a leader of the city's 25,000-member Cambodian
community. He said the woman who defected in Lowell ``made her own
decision without anybody interfering.''
   Many Cambodians in the United States believe that Vietnam
controls their country. Vietnamese troops withdrew in 1989 after 10
years of occupation.
   The dance company now touring the U.S. is part of the
government-controlled University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh.
   It performed before a sellout crowd of 3,000 in the Lowell
Auditorium on Saturday, said Ruth Meehan, cultural events
coordinator of the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission, which
cosponsored the event.
   INS officials wouldn't discuss the case, citing policy keeping
cases private.
   Three dancers stayed behind in Minnesota after an appearance at
the Ordway Music Theatre in St. Paul. They were a brother and
sister, Hing Rachhana and Hing Thonnora, and a male dancer, Nou Van
Thy.

<HEAD>Six Reportedly Commit Suicide Over Job Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least six students committed suicide
Monday to protest a job quota program that reserves half of the
government's jobs for lower-caste Hindus, news reports said.
   Press Trust and United News of India, both news agencies, said
five students poisoned themselves and one set himself ablaze. The
incidents took place in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Andhra
Pradesh.
   Students from higher castes, angered by a government refusal to
review the plan, attacked a passenger train in the central Indian
city of Allahabad, and set two train cars on fire. There were no
reports of casualties.
   In New Delhi, three students attempted suicide, Press Trust
said.
   Students from the city's schools, which opened Monday after
nearly a month of forced closure, attacked buses and damaged30,
the news agency said.
   Monday's deaths brought to at least 90 the number of people who
have killed themselves or died in violence since Prime Minister
V.P. Singh announced Aug. 7 that nearly half of all government jobs
would be reserved for lower-caste Hindus.
   Public opposition to the government has been widespread in the
politically influential cities of northern India. The army was
called out and curfews clamped on several towns to control rioting
students, joined sometimes by housewives and government employees.
   Two members of Singh's governing party have resigned from
Parliament and some colleagues have demanded his ouster because of
the quotas.
   But Singh has refused to abandon the policy, saying it is an
affirmative action program that would give social justice to the
lower castes.
   Critics say he fears alienating the lower castes, which form a
majority of the eligible voters among India's 880 million people.
   Upper-caste students say reverse discrimination will deprive
them of jobs for which they are better qualified.
   The plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for low-caste
Hindus. An additional 22 percent already are set aside for the
lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of Indian society.

<TEXT>
   Police opened fire on stone-throwing
Palestinians at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City today, and
Israeli police said 19 people were killed and 140 were injured.
   Arab hospital officials first said 22 were killed. However, they
later gave a lower casualty toll than the one provided by Israeli
Police Minister Roni Milo, saying 18 Palestinians were killed and
125 wounded.
   The incident was the bloodiest in the holy city since Israel
captured its Arab sector from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
   The death toll also was the highest in a single day since the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation began in December
1987.
   In disturbances following today's rioting, two Palestinians were
killed in the occupied Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   The Jerusalem clash erupted after Palestinians threw stones from
the Mount at Jews worshiping below at the Wailing Wall, Judaism's
holiest site, witnesses said. Thousands of Jews were at the wall
celebrating the Sukkot festival.
   Milo said 20 Jews were injured. He said 120 Arabs were arrested,
including Faisal Husseini, a prominent Palestinian nationalist
involved in unofficial peace contacts with Israeli moderates. He
said Husseini was arrested on the Temple Mount.
   A senior paramilitary border police officer, Yossi Tobias, told
Israel radio some 3,000 Arabs were involved in the rioting.
   The Palestinians apparently were angered by rumors that Jews
were trying to establish a presence on the Temple Mount, which is
holy to both Jews and Moslems, but is under Moslem control.
   The Arabs burned down a police station in the Temple Mount
compound and hurled hundreds of rocks at Jewish worshipers.
   As thousands of Jews fled from the Wailing Wall, police riot
squads fired tear gas to disperse Arab rioters on the mount above.
Witnesses said the Palestinians regrouped and charged the police.
   Police opened fire with rubber and plastic bullets and then live
ammunition, the witnesses said.
   Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner said:
   ``They burned the police station. There was no policeman who
wasn't stoned. Their lives were in real danger. They had no other
way but to respond the way they did. The toll was very heavy, but
the Israel police had to defend themselves, and to protect the
thousands of worshipers.''
   Terner told reporters that authorities had repeatedly assured
Moslem leaders that no Jewish demonstrations on the Temple Mount
would be permitted.
   At the same news conference, Milo said caches of rocks and
flammable materials were found on the Temple Mount. This, he said,
showed that the riot was ``a planned provocation'' aimed partly at
distracting the world's attention from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Palestinians have largely sided with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in the confrontation over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Calm returned to the Temple Mount about two hours after the
incident, but throughout the day scattered incidents occurred in
the Old City. Israel radio said it had reports of Jewish civilians
shooting at Arabs.
   Until today, the worst toll in the uprising was 17 dead on April
16, 1988, when rioting swept the West Bank and Gaza Strip after PLO
military leader Khalil Wazir was killed in Tunis in a commando
raid.
   The raid was blamed on Israel.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization issued a statement from
its headquarters in Tunisia, accusing the Israelis of a massacre.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, a top aide to PLO leader Yasser Arafat, said
the U.N. Security Council should take urgent steps to protect
Palestinians and force an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
territories.
   After today's rioting broke out, police closed off the area
around the Wailing Wall, the last remnant of the ancient Jewish
temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70.
   On the Temple Mount, pools of blood stained the ground around
the Al Aqsa Mosque. Palestinians said thousands of Moslems,
including some wounded, remained in the mosque, apparently afraid
to come out with the heavily armed border police still around.
   At Augusta Victoria Hospital, 26-year-old Khaled Shlatef of
Ramallah in the West Bank said the Arabs had rushed to defend the
mount after hearing that Jews were going to enter.
   ``We are Moslems, and we came here to defend our mosque,'' said
Shlatef, who was wounded in the head with rubber bullets.
   The rumors followed the distribution of leaflets by a Jewish
extremist group called the Temple Mount Faithful saying it planned
to go up to the mount. The group wants to build a new Jewish temple
on the Mount to replace the ancient one. However, the group's
members did not arrive in the area until after the rioting was
under way.
   The trouble began shortly before 11 a.m. (5 a.m. EDT) when Arabs
burned the police station and at the same time threw hundreds of
stones at the Jews below, police said.
   Mel Rosen, a witness watching from his balcony 300 yards away,
said he saw a barrage of stones pour onto worshipers at the wall.
   Rosen, an American photographer, said riot squads then entered
the Temple Mount compound and scattered the crowd with tear gas.
The Arabs regrouped and threw more stones over the wall, prompting
the police to open fire, he said.
   He said the torrent of rocks was so thick that onlookers at
first thought they were seeing flocks of birds flying out of the
crannies of the wall where they nest.
   Women praying in their section of the gender-segregated plaza
ran for shelter in the tunnels alongside part of the Wall.
   ``There was a shower of stones and that is when people started
to panic. People started shouting `Where is my child?' and
running,'' said Oded Wiener, who was at the Wall.

<HEAD>De Klerk Says Exiles Can Apply to Return Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk announced
Monday that political exiles can begin applying to return to South
Africa, addressing a key demand of the African National Congress.
   His statement followed a three-hour meeting with ANC leader
Nelson Mandela at which they apparently differed on causes of black
factional fighting that has killed about 800 people in eight weeks.
   De Klerk said that exiles, many based in Zambia and other
southern African nations, could immediately begin applying for
amnesty for ``political offenses.''
   But he cautioned: ``No indemnity for anyone, or for any event or
offense is granted automatically.'' He said any possible indemnity
would only apply to acts committed before Monday's meeting.
   The move could help resolve one of the major stumbling blocks of
peace talks between the white-led government and Mandela's ANC, the
largest black opposition movement.
   The ANC has demanded the return of its estimated 20,000 exiles
before beginning full-scale negotiations on black-white power
sharing and ending apartheid.
   Until Monday, the government had agreed in principle but never
announced a mechanism.
   De Klerk's statement said full details of the process would be
announced later. It also said exiles from other organizations may
be included. Smaller black opposition groups also have members who
fled South Africa after committing politically motivated acts.
   The government also agreed to release 15 more political
prisoners this week, the statement said. Dozens have been freed in
recent months, but up to 3,000 remain imprisoned, according to the
ANC.
   A working group on the return of exiles was set up as part of
the government-ANC talks launched in May. De Klerk's statement said
activation of the exile return process followed ANC acceptance of
the working group's report.
   The ANC requested Monday's meeting to discuss the peace process,
which has been strained by the factional fighting that erupted Aug.
12 in black townships around Johannesburg.
   A separate joint statement read by Mandela after the meeting
said ``note was taken of the different current perceptions
concerning the causes and handling of the violence.''
   ``All sides must do their utmost to bring this violence to an
end,'' it said. ``Both sides reaffirmed the need to keep the
negotiating process on course.''
   Mandela, who has accused security forces of orchestrating the
violence, was expected to hand de Klerk information about his
accusations Monday. After the meeting, he refused to answer
questions.
   De Klerk and government officials have denied security force
involvement in the fighting.
   The main combatants in the township battles have been supporters
of the ANC and Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement.
Both groups oppose apartheid but differ over plans for a future
South Africa.
   The fighting has slowed in recent weeks, but there are still
sporadic incidents.

   In 1492, Columbus came to America. On Monday,
a group of Americans went to Columbus, aboard 1492.
   USAir's regular Flight 1492 soared east from Los Angeles
International Airport and headed for Columbus, Ohio, on the 498th
anniversary of the Italian explorer's discovery of the Americas.
   ``The only people who do notice are the elderly people. I guess
younger people don't associate with it,'' said USAir's Marcie Grow,
a customer service representative.
   One traveler who noticed was Burt Jones of South Pasadena, a
self-described ``kindly old gent'' who refused to divulge his age.
   ``When I booked the flight I started laughing hysterically,''
Jones said. ``She (the agent) didn't understand.''
   The Columbus-bound Boeing 737-300 left Gate 13 at 9 a.m. with 58
people aboard. The flight begins in San Francisco and ends at
National Airport in Washington, D.C.
   Jones had a suggestion for USAir officials should they decide to
change the flight number.
   ``Well, there's always 1493, when Columbus sailed the deep blue
sea,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
was upgraded from serious to satisfactory condition Monday at LDS
Hospital, where he is recovering from brain surgery.
   The 91-year-old Mormon leader was transferred from the
hospital's intensive care unit to a private room, church spokesman
Don LeFevre said.
   Benson is recovering from surgery last month to remove blood
clots from his brain and from gastrointestinal bleeding discovered
last week.
   He was hospitalized Sept. 18 after complaining of severe
headaches and difficulty swallowing. The following day, doctors
removed two large blood clots from each side of his brain; he
underwent a second operation four days later after one of the clots
reformed.
   Monday was the second time during Benson's hospital stay that he
has been moved out of intensive care. On Sept. 28, he was upgraded
to fair condition and moved to a regular room, only to be returned
to intensive care in serious condition after doctors found the
gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Church officials had hoped that Benson could attend this
weekend's 160th Semiannual General Conference.

historic rail bridge crossing the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh.
   The ceremony Sunday was watched by about 250,000 people in the
centennial year of the Forth Bridge, regarded by Victorians as the
eighth wonder of the world.
   The lighting followed a day of festivities and a sound-and-light
show using five tons of fireworks as well as lasers and

   The cantilever bridge was the largest steel structure in the
world when it opened on March 4, 1890. It is 8,296 feet long, or
just over 1{ miles, and stands 361 feet from high water to the top

   NEW YORK (AP) - Ivana Trump's pay for running the Plaza Hotel
has been increased from $1 per year and all the dresses she can
buy, to an actual salary, according to a published report.
   New York magazine quoted an unidentified source inside estranged
husband Donald Trump's organization as saying she recently
succeeded in getting a salary.
   Eleanor Lambrt, a Plaza spokeswoman, said Mrs. Trump ``made a
big stand to get a salary.''
   But the magazine adds ``that clearly won't be enough to let her
continue to live like a Trump.''
   Mrs. Trump stands to collect $20 million from a prenuptial
agreement, later updated during the marriage, if it ends in
divorce. She has indicated she will contest the agreement.
   Since the news of the Trumps' estrangement became public in
February, Trump has suffered a series of financial setbacks.

<HEAD>House Republicans Relegated To Sidelines Because of Ideological
Split</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans, Capitol Hill's forgotten
minority, are suffering from a deep ideological split that has left
them on the sidelines of America's budget crisis.
   The division, which dates to the election a year ago of Rep.
Newt Gingrich to the party's No. 2 leadership post, pits old-line
pragmatists against rebellious activists who are tired of more than
three decades of minority status.
   ``It's a very difficult time around here,'' said Rep. William
Broomfield, R-Mich., who was first elected in 1956, the same year
as Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. ``I've never seen it quite
like this, the bitterness and rancor that exists.''
   When he was elected to the leadership last year, Gingrich
promised colleagues that he would assume the team player
responsibilities that go with the job. But last week he abandoned
Michel and President Bush, and led rebels who killed the first
attempt at a bipartisan budget package.
   Then on Sunday, as GOP leaders sought to take a role in drawing
up a new version of the budget, Gingrich's demands in a closed-door
Republican meeting hampered the efforts and the package was
assembled and passed without them.
   The rebels apparently have calculated that the budget issue can
be a good political weapon leading to the election of more
Republicans on Nov. 6.
   But Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., countered one Gingrich supporter
making that argument at the private meeting, saying GOP candidates
were the ones who would be hurt.
   One of Gingrich's top allies, Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., said
Republicans ``are slowly getting themselves back on a united,
positive footing.'' A key to that, he said, is that the
``bipartisan budget will be transformed over the next 10 days into
the Democratic tax increase.''
   Frustration with Gingrich's actions broke into the open late
Sunday as each party sought to blame the other for the partial
shutdown of the government over the weekend. Gingrich contended
that Democrats, after failing to override Bush's veto of a stopgap
spending bill, now have ``an obligation to respond to that failure
by cooperating with the president.''
   That was too much for House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, who
thundered back: ``Of all the people in this House, of all the
people in this country who has little claim to cooperation with his
president, it is the gentleman from Georgia.''
   The jab was particularly effective, because it hit Gingrich
where he is weakest within his own party: on the issue of loyalty
and trustworthiness. The Georgian had no comeback, but just smiled
and then strode off the House floor.
   During a closed-door Republican conference earlier in the day,
Rep. Rod Chandler of Washington said, ``Those who do not support
the president and the leadership should be silent, or resign,''
according to one lawmaker present, in a clear reference to
Gingrich.
   Gingrich is out on a limb, some colleagues say. But that's not
an unusual position for the white-haired, 47-year-old conservative.
And he is hardly alone.
   He picked fights with a former House speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill,
and was instrumental in forcing another former speaker, Jim Wright,
to resign.
   ``This guy has no agenda except to create chaos, and to destroy
Democrats,'' said Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn.
   But that brand of firebrand partisanship was attracting support
from Republicans who are tired of more than three decades of
minority status in the House, a frustration amplified by budget
summits that left the rank and file out of decisions.
   With 176 members, united House Republicans have the power to
sustain President Bush's vetoes of legislation. But they often are
ignored by the White House, which prefers to deal with Republicans
in the Senate, where the playing field is less tilted against them.
   Some House GOP members have taken to calling themselves ``the
potted plant caucus,'' a self-deprecating sign of their feelings of
irrelevance. ``Members are hungering for a leader who will stand up
for the conference'' and not simply follow orders from the White
House, said one GOP lawmaker.
   But others pointed to an irony: that Gingrich's opposition to
the original budget package meant the failure of the best proposal
Republicans could hope for. ``The longer the process takes, the
more liberal the package becomes,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   The outcome means Gingrich likely will face a challenge when the
party convenes to elect its leaders next year, said several
Republicans.

   Like giant sand beetles, the
eight-wheeled reconnaissance vehicles scuttled across the dry lake
bed, pausing periodically behind dunes, then darting ahead in a
leapfrog pattern.
   At each stop, turret commanders scanned the terrain for signs of
activity - a dust cloud, or the dark specks of armored vehicles on
the horizon.
   For nearly an hour, there was nothing. Then, monitoring the
radio, Lance Cpl. Shannon Whitehead, 20, of Baytown, Texas,
reported: ``Second platoon has spotted enemy tracks. Some kind of
mechanized threat. The tanks are moving up.''
   The Marine Corps LAV-25s, too lightly armed to tangle with enemy
armor, withdrew swiftly to the rear. A platoon of M-60 tanks
churned forward, deploying into the line of battle and hoping the
element of surprise - vital in desert warfare - had not been lost.
   It was only a war game. In real battle, heavy artillery and
aircraft would be hurled in the first minutes of fighting to
disrupt and destroy the enemy.
   The scenario played out by the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, is as
old as war itself.
   Alexander owed his greatness in part to the horsemen scouting
ahead of his marching legions. So did Gen. Robert E. Lee, who
called J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry the ``eyes of the army.''
   If war comes to the Saudi desert, U.S. officers say it will be a
classic battle of armor, not unlike those between Gen. Erwin
Rommel's Afrika Korps and the British in North Africa or the Arabs
and Israelis in Sinai.
   ``The technology is new, but the tactics really haven't changed
since World War II,'' a Marine officer said after a day of chasing
the simulated enemy across the ands.
   The reconnaissance teams, like these speedy Marine corps
vehicles, may largely determine where and when a battle would
begin. Then, officers say, the edge would go to whoever makes the
best use of supporting arms - air power and artillery.
   Some officers believe the key to stopping an Iraqi armored
thrust rests mainly with tank-killer aircraft - the Army's AH-64
Apache and AH-1 Cobra helicopters and the Air Force A-10 Warthogs.
   The Iraqis have built heavily fortified positions, with tanks
dug in behind earthen berms along the potential battle line between
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   But U.S. officers say they don't expect a static battle.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf III, the U.S. commander in Saudi
Arabia, called desert warfare a ``war of attrition'' based on high
mobility and lethality.
   ``It's not a war of straight lines drawn in the sand, where you
dig in and say `I'll defend here or die,''' Schwarzkopf said in a
recent interview. ``Most people who do that die.''
   Lack of protective cover in the desert makes deception
difficult, and speed and surprise paramount, field officers said.
   They talk of fast-moving armored forces vying for position that
gives them the ``flank shot'' that hits an enemy tank in its most
vulnerable spot, anywhere but the heavily protected nose.
   ``Even if the other guy's tank is supposedly better than yours,
if you get the first shot and make it count, you win,'' said one
Marine officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Army Lt. Col. Rick Sanchez of Rio Grande City, Texas, who
commands a battalion of M1 tanks in the 19th Armored Brigade,
likens tank warfare to ``the way the navy would fight a battle in
the ocean - vector in on him and try to outmanuever him in the vast
expanse.''
   The allied side and the Iraqis are doing roughly the same thing,
putting lighter forces farthest forward, backed up by heavy forces
that could defend by launching a counterattack.
   The Saudis and other Arab forces are farthest north, where they
would be the first to make contact with a southward Iraqi thrust
out of Kuwait or Iraq.
   The Americans, with their greater mobility, airpower and
firepower, are to the rear - a political positioning that also
leaves them in the role of counterstrike force.
   The United States also has some 10,600 Marines aboard amphibious
ships to join any offensive.

   The season's most popular novelty is a
pocket-size electronic voice box that, at the push of a button,
spews profane insults suitable for use in locker rooms, saloons and
stockbrokers' offices.
   This adult toy is called the Final Word, and it delivers
pre-recorded obscenities in a shrill voice that sounds like an
angry chipmunk from Brooklyn.
   ``They're flying out the door,'' said Joan Geisler, owner of
Postermat in Greenwich Village, as she waited for a broker to pick
up his order of 60. ``People are calling up and reserving them by
the dozens.'' Uptown, Dapy's on Columbus Avenue reported selling
more than 250 in two days.
   The Final Word, which sells for $16.95, is a battery-powered,
pre-programmed voice synthesizer that looks something like a beeper
and sounds something like Andrew Dice Clay. It is designed to
appeal to people who like the sound of dirty words, but may be
reluctant to actually speak them.
   The Final Word, according to its manufacturer, allows people to
talk back to ``all those obnoxious people in life, such as nagging
in-laws, pushy sales people and know-it-all-bosses.'' All of whom,
no doubt, have already purchased their own Final Word.
   The device comes in two versions, one rated ``G,'' the other
``X.'' The former repeats these phrases: ``You're an idiot'';
``Drop dead''; ``You're a dope''; and ``Stupid jerk.''
   The content of the other version cannot be repeated here. Care
to guess which of the two sells better?
   Once buyers hear the stronger version, ``They've got to have
it,'' chortled Geisler, who has taken to using the X-rated version
extensively over the telephone.
   ``A few years ago no one would have bought something like this,
but now everything goes,'' she mused.
   Terri Boyle, spokeswoman for the manufacturer, said the device
has proved popular in elevators, restaurants and cocktail parties.
   One example: A man shopping for a car was offered one by a
dealer for an exorbitant price. The shopper told the dealer he'd
punch the figure into his pocket calculator. Under the calculator
he held the Final Word, which at the push of a button produced a
scatological response to the inflated price - much to the dealer's
surprise.
   In six weeks more than a half million units of the Final Word
have been sold, and Banning Enterprises Ltd. of Farmingdale plans
to ship out another million by Christmas.
   ``Business is very bad in gifts, and everybody's looking for a
winner,'' said Geisler, who described the Final Word as one of the
most popular novelties in her 30 years in the gift business.
   Displaying the X-rated version presents retailers with a
problem. One store in Cleveland demonstrates it in a back room, out
of earshot of most customers. Geisler plays it for selected
customers, asking, ``Have you heard the Final Word?''
   The Final Word is the creation of Budd Goldman. He, Geisler
claims, is a novelty genius who also gave the world shower heads
with people's faces on them and miniature, desktop replicas of
refrigerators and lockers.
   The Final Word is particularly popular on Wall Street, where
these days people are eager for a laugh of any sort. One firm
ordered several hundred, perhaps to sum up the feelings of bulls
trapped in a bear market.

<HEAD>University Students Test Blood In Drive To Help Leukemia Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 160 students at George Washington
University had their blood tested Monday to see if they are
candidates for donating bone marrow to an alumnus who is suffering
from leukemia.
   It was the kickoff of a national effort to recruit donors for
Ronni Cohen, 32, and thousands of others in need of a bone marrow
transplant.
   ``We think there are 10,000 people in the United States every
year who need transplants,'' retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, board
chairman of the national marrow donor program, told a news
conference. ``Out of the 10,000, only 3,000 are able to find a
match.''
   Zumwalt, whose son died of blood cancer, said his organization
has signed up thousands of Americans to be ``volunteer donors for
people they don't know.''
   ``Initially, we were able to transplant 20 a month,'' he said.
``Now it's 20 a week. We need to get to 20 a day.''
   Ms. Cohen, a 32-year-old public-interest lawyer and executive
director of the Siegfried Foundation, has chronic myelogenous
leukemia, a cancer of the blood-forming bone marrow. The disease
usually strikes people between 45 and 60. A search of 500,000
potential donors in national and international registries has found
no match.
   A hematologist at Washington Hospital Center, Dr. Mamoud
Mustafa, said patients with blood cancers can get into long-term
remissions with a bone marrow transplant, which he describes as
relatively painless for the donor.

   The federal government's partial shutdown is

least several million dollars in revenue from frustrated tourists
and campers.
   From the campgrounds at Cape Hatteras National Seashore to
Yosemite National Park in California, hundreds of thousands of
dollars were lost this three-day weekend in camping fees, entry
fees to parks, tolls along scenic highways and sales in museums and
shops, officials said.
   In many places private concessionaires continued to operate, but
parks were without guides, toll collectors or supervisors, forcing
the grounds to be closed and campers to be directed away.
   The shutdowns and lost revenue stemmed from attempts by
lawmakers and the Bush administration to reach an agreement on how
best to cut the federal budget deficit.
   ``That's the irony of it,'' remarked Interior Department
spokesman Steve Goldstein. ``We don't have personnel to man the
parks, so we lose two ways. We can't open our resources to the
public and we didn't gain any revenue.''
   He said the park personnel would have had to be classified as
``essential'' to safety and health to be exempt from the shutdown
directive.
   Spokesmen for the National Park Service said the revenue losses
are likely to be substantial because the Columbus Day weekend
traditionally is a busy period for many of the parks.
   The service said very preliminary figures indicated a loss for
the weekend of more than $1.6 million. Officials acknowledged the
amount could be higher.
   ``Usually you're looking at this weekend through Veterans Day as
the peak fall visitor period,'' said Duncan Morrow, a service
spokesman. He estimated that 750,000 visitors normally can be
expected to visit the scores of parks known for their autumn
colors.
   Along Skyline Drive in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains,
motorists out to see the fall foliage at its peak did not have to
pay the usual $5 fee as federal toll stations were closed.
Officials said as many as 75,000 people enter Shenendoah National
Park along the drive on a typical Columbus Day weekend, but this
weekend nobody counted.
   At Yosemite, rangers cleared 6,000 campers from the park, losing
camping fees ranging from $3.50 to $12 a night, officials said.
   At the Grand Canyon, losses in revenue were estimated at more
than $25,000 a day during the weekend. Roads were blocked and
campgrounds closed at other parks such as Olympic National Park.
   ``It's rather sad that they picked the parks (to close down).
It's like they kind of cut their nose to spite their face,'' said
Garner Hansen, president of National Park Concessions Inc., a
company operating at five parks including Mammoth Cave National
Park in Kentucky.
   Hansen said Mammoth Cave remained open, but all tours, costing
$1.75 to $4.50, were cancelled. ``The visitors are very unhappy.
They traveled long distances for the cave trips.... We're the only
ones here and they're giving us an earful,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Not far from Capitol Hill, where the budget drama has been
unfolding, angry and disappointed tourists couldn't get into the
White House, climb the Washington Monument or visit the complex of
museums belonging to the Smithsonian Institution. Tourists could
still walk among the animals of the National Zoo, although indoor
zoo facilities, including the famous Panda House, were closed.
   Almost all of the tourist attractions in the capital, including
museums, are free.
   Union officials, meanwhile, bemoaned the shutdown.
   ``It doesn't save any money,'' said John Sturdivant, president
of the 700,000-member American Federation of Government Employees.
``When they shut down in 1981 it ended up costing them $5 million
(in lost revenue).... It just creates problems, hassles and severe
dislocation.''

<HEAD>Governor Says He's Not Worried About Possible Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said Monday that he is
not worried about a re-election challenge from ex-Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke and suggested that Duke might learn something
from his U.S. Senate bid.
   ``He lost, as he does most races. Maybe he can change,'' Roemer
said during an impromptu news conference.
   Roemer said that the race by Duke, a first-term member of the
Louisiana House, against U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston did show
that voters have ``a lot of anger and anxiety ... against the
federal government.''
   ``I was pleased that Bennett won and I'm proud of the people of
Louisiana for making that decision,'' the governor said. ``But
there are a number of people who think the federal government is
not responsive on energy policy, on balancing the budget.
   ``I think to ignore that anger is to ignore the fact. ... It's
time for the federal government to wake up, put up and get this
country right again. I think that's what that vote shows.''
   Running as a maverick Republican, Duke picked up 44 percent of
the vote in Saturday's primary against Johnston, a Democrat,
despite his opponents' constant focus on his past as grand wizard
of the KKK with ties to Nazi groups.
   Duke disavows his Klan past but says government policies need to
be changed to give equal rights to whites. He advocates stricter
limits on welfare and a flat-rate income tax, along with opposition
to forced busing of schoolchildren and affirmative action programs.
   Duke, who said he will decide in the coming weeks on a 1991
governor's race, noted that he received a larger percentage of the
vote than Roemer did in 1987.
   Johnston and Duke were the only major candidates running in
Saturday's Senate election after state Sen. Ben Bagert dropped out.
Bagert, the Republican candidate who had his party's endorsement,
quit the race last week after running a poor third in opinion
polls.
   Bagert said he wanted to throw his support to the Democrat,
Johnston, in order to lessen the chances that Duke would force
Johnston into a runoff. Under the state's open primary system,
candidates compete in one primary regardless of party and a runoff
is held between the top two finishers only if no one receives 50
percent of the vote.
   In the 1987 gubernatorial election, Roemer led a field of five
major candidates with slightly more than a third of the vote. He
won the governor's race by default when incumbent Edwin Edwards
conceded the runoff.
   Duke won a special election for a Louisiana House seat in 1989.
He previously ran for the state Senate and as the Populist Party
candidate for president in 1988.
   ``He's been a very ineffective member of the Legislature and I
say that with as much kindness as my honesty would permit me,''
Roemer said. ``Very ineffective. I would expect that to continue.''

   ``I think flights with the shuttle are becoming a little more
routine with the American public,'' he added.
   Haley said Discovery will land on a 15,000-foot, paved runway
instead of an unpaved strip because NASA wants to test how well the
shuttle's brakes work on concrete. Such tests are a prelude to
eventual landings at the shuttle's launch site at Cape Canaveral,
Fla.

   Lithuania's deputy prime minister, Romualdas
Ozolas, predicted Monday that Soviet officials will recognize
Lithuanian independence by mid-1991, following negotiations that
began at the Kremlin last week, Tass reported.
   Lithuanian declared independence from the Soviet Union on March
11.
   The official news agency quoted Ozolas as describing the talks
as productive and saying that if the negotiations continue as
planned, they will ``end with the signing of a treaty recognizing
the Lithuanian republic.''
   ``I believe this will happen no later than in the first half of
1991.''
   Lithuanian and Soviet officials agreed after their initial
meetings to conduct their economic and trade relations for 1991 as
equal partners.
   A communique issued later also mentioned preparations for future
``negotiations.'' That is a significant concession by the Soviet
side, because President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has maintained that
bilateral ``negotiations'' can occur only between two nations and
not between the Kremlin and a republic.
   The talks were the first at such a high level since Lithuania
suspended its declaration of independence following the Kremlin's
economic embargo against the republic.
   Tass also said a joint Soviet-Lithuanian working group would
begin meeting Wednesday at the Kremlin to set a date and lay the
foundation for future negotiations. Ozolas and Soviet Deputy Prime
Minister Vitaly Doguzhiyev will head the group.

<TEXT>
   Grim-faced relatives, one in tears,
saw photographs Monday of the muddy, human-shaped indentations made
in grassy fields by bodies plummeting from the wreckage of bombed
Pan Am Flight 103.
   Police photographs showed wreckage from the Boeing 747 imbedded
in homes and strewn across fields and forests over 845 square miles
of southern Scotland and northern England.
   There were pictures of bodies, but Scotland's senior law
officer, Lord Fraser, the Lord Advocate, barred them from being
shown to the first public inquiry into the crash because they would
distress the reatives. The pictures were briefly described instead.
   For Betty Thomas of Wales, who lost her daughter and
granddaughter, one glimpse of ``a leg or an arm,'' shown by mistake
for a moment, was enough. She said she didn't look at the rest.
   Tears streamed down the cheeks of Marina de Larracoechea, sister
of Pan Am flight attendant Maria Nieves Larrachoechea of Spain. Her
sister was one of the 270 people who died when a terrorist bomb
blew the New York-bound plane apart over Lockerbie on Dec. 21,
1988.
   ``It got me upset,'' Ms. Larracoechea said later. ``It was the
most thorough run-through of Lockerbie - to realize how the ground
was covered with debris . . . the tremendous waste of lives.''
   She said she was grateful pictures of the bodies weren't shown.
Just looking at the wreckage, she said, ``I know how maimed they
were, how blown to pieces.''
   The bodies of 17 victims were never found and two bodies and 658
bags of human remains were never identified, said John Boyd, chief
constable of Dumfries and Galloway region at the time of the crash
and now inspector of constabulary for Scotland.
   Aerial photos showed indentations of bodies in fields. One
closeup showed the outlines of a victim, his torso and outspread
legs etched in mud.
   The photographs showed the huge crater on Sherwood Crescent, at
the edge of the main A74 highway from England to Scotland. The
fuel-laden wing section exploded there, damaging or destroying 20
houses and vaporizing some victims.
   There were also photos of parts of the plane, of debris hanging
in trees, and lines of searchers looking for victims.
   Boyd read large sections of his report on the police emergency
response into the record and was questioned by Fraser.
   The inquiry, expected to last three months, is focusing on the
causes of death and ways to prevent a similar disaster, not on
criminal responsibility.
   Boyd said Scottish police investigators went to Helsinki,
Finland, in January 1989 to investigate a warning telephoned to the
U.S. Embassy there Dec. 5 that a bomb would be carried on a Pan
American World Airways flight from Frankfurt in the following two
weeks.
   ``There was no evidence to connect the Helsinki warning with the
Lockerbie incident,'' he said.
   Under cross-examination, Boyd said the warning mentioned a
particular person who was investigated, and said he still believed
no connection existed.
   He agreed that other, unspecified warnings were made to
embassies in Helsinki in 1988 in what appeared to be a ``personal
vendetta against a named individual.''
   New York attorney Stephen Pounian, representing the families of
American victims, tried to ask Boyd if police had information on a
warning to Pan Am about a Toshiba radio.
   Fraser leaped to his feet and protested, saying that went to
``the core'' of the criminal investigation.
   Police have said the bomb, hidden in a Toshiba radiocassette
recorder in a suitcase, probably was put aboard Flight 103 in
Frankfurt. The flight changed from a Boeing 727 to a Boeing 747 at
London's Heathrow Airport.
   Scottish officials have said they were investigating several
radical Palestinian groups. Fraser has said he was convinced the
bombers would be caught.

   A surprise weekend snowstorm thrilled
Colorado ski resort operators and left Cheyenne yards littered with
tree limbs that snapped under the weight of wet snow.
   The storm, which struck southeast Wyoming late Saturday and
eastern Colorado the next day, dumped 10 inches of snow here. The
mountains of northern Utah and parts of western Nebraska also got
snow over the weekend.
   The National Weather Service said a record 7.9 inches fell here
Sunday, nearly doubling the old record for the date. The snow
continued until early Monday.
   Colorado authorities blamed the storm for a power outage in Fort
Collins and a small-plane crash near Aurora.
   Tree surgeons here were swamped with calls Monday.
   Tera Soule of Wyoming Tree Surgery, Inc. said the storm caused
the most damage she's seen in eight years.
   ``I would say yesterday I had two dozen phone calls and today
I've had about 65 phone calls,'' she said. ``This is just
tremendous. This is the worst one since we've been in business.''
   Terry Smith, general manager of Year-Round Landscapes, said the
storm generated about two weeks of work for his company. He
estimated the tree damage at more than $50,000.
   Ski resort operators were thrilled.
   Betsey Farney of Vail Associates said Vail mountain reported 10
inches of snow, Breckenridge reported nearly a foot and Aspen had
13 inches.
   The National Weather Service said the Mary Jane ski resort near
Winter Park reported 8 inches of snow, Loveland reported 7.5 inches
and Winter Park got up to 6 inches.
   Colorado's ski season officially opens after Thanksgiving.
   The National Weather Service forecast more snow for southeastern
Colorado.
   About 5,000 Fort Collins residents were without power Sunday
night, authorities said. Power was restored to most customers by
late Monday morning.
   Meanwhile, a Denver-area man was hospitalized in serious
condition Monday at Aurora Presbyterian Hospital after his plane
crashed about one-quarter mile from Buckley Air National Guard base
near Aurora.
   ``It appears he iced up pretty bad,'' Arapahoe County Sheriff's
Lt. Tom Kirby said.
   By sunrise Monday, four to six inches of snow had fallen in
parts of western Nebraska, the weather service said.

   Iranian security forces Monday watched
for possible election disruptions by anti-Western fundamentalists
blocked from running for a panel that picks the country's spiritual
leader, diplomatic sources said.
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was among the first to cast ballots in an
election some fundamentalists allege was rigged to keep them off
the 83-member Assembly of Experts and preserve Khamenei's power.
   Khamenei, who favors improved relations with the West, was named
in June 1989 to succeed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini a few days
after the revolutionary patriarch died of cancer.
   Sources said the hard-liners sought enough seats to depose
Khamenei in favor of a council. A rule change by Khamenei, however,
forced many of the fundamentalists out of the race.
   There were no incidents of violence reported in the election,
but there were conflicting observations on voter turnout.
   Diplomatic sources in Tehran said there was a light turnout. But
the state Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
voting was extended up to three hours in 20 of Iran's 24 provinces
because of ``heavy turnout.''
   There was no immediate word on when the results of the voting
for 100 candidates would be announced. But initial results are
likely to be known Tuesday.
   Among those voting were former prisoners-of-war recently
released by Iraq, which waged an eight-year war against Iran, the
news agency reported. Anyone over 15 years old can vote in Iran,
which has an estimated electorate of 25 million.
   Prior to the election, Khamenei ordered his allies on the
Council of Guardians, a constitutional watchdog body, to require
all candidates to pass an examination on Islamic jurisprudence.
   Of 169 would-be candidates who sat for the exam, 60 flunked,
including Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi and many other
hard-liners, sources said.
   Some radicals refused to submit to the examination. Others who
passed withdrew their names in protest.
   Khamenei and President Hashemi Rafsanjani are leaders of Iran's
so-called pragmatists, which favor better ties with the West and
seek foreign investment to revive Iran's economy following the
1980-88 war with Iraq.
   The Assembly of Experts sits for an eight-year term.
   The conflict over the balloting has strained relations between
the rival factions and exposed the long-running power struggle in
Tehran's hierarchy.
   Fistfights took place in the radical-dominated, 270-member
Majlis, or parliament, during a debate on the elections last week,
sources in Tehran reported.
   The official media has not reported the brawl, but in a speech
broadcast by Tehran Radio on Monday, Khamenei admitted there had
been sharp differences in parliament.
   ``Two brothers in the Islamic Republic have a verbal exchange
over an issue, which is a normal thing ... and see what a ruckus
the foreign media raises.''
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said radicals
attempted to meet twice last week at Tehran University, apparently
to organize protests. But both gatherings were broken up by
security forces.
   Iran's largest opposition group, the Iraq-based Mujahedeen
Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said two divisions of the
Revolutionary Guards Corps were deployed in Tehran to prevent any
radical backlash.
   That report could not be independently confirmed. But an Asian
diplomat, speaking by telephone from Tehran, said security forces
were watching for any demonstrations.
   The radicals, led by former interior minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, have been on the defensive since Khomeini's death and
fear a purge by Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani has replaced many
hard-liners in ministry posts with Western-educated officials. He
has also gained a tighter grip on the judiciary.
   Radicals suffered a further blow last month when Tehran resumed
relations with Britain after a 19-month break.

   A jury was selected Monday in the assault
case of Edward Lewis Humphrey, a suspect in the slayings of five
college students in Gainesville, who is accused of the unrelated
beating of his grandmother.
   In the assault case, six jurors and two alternates were seated
late Monday afternoon out of a pool of 20 potential jurors. Most of
those in the pool said they were aware Humphrey has been the focus
of intense scrutiny by the police task force investigating the
unrelated slayings in August.
   ``This is the kind of case that generally would not see the
courthouse or courtroom if it was anyone other than Ed Humphrey,''
said public defender J.R. Russo.
   Opening arguments were set to begin Tuesday. If convicted of the
charge of battery of a person over 65 years old, Humphrey faces a
minimum of 3 years in prison.
   Most of the potential jurors had said they wouldn't let news
reports cloud their judgment, but at least one was excused by
Circuit Judge Theron A. Yawn Jr. after commenting on the assault
charges.
   ``I get upset by people who beat up women,'' Willard Bronson
said before he was dismissed. Another woman was dismissed for cause
after she said she would have to be convinced of Humphrey's
innocence, rather than his guilt.
   Humphrey has been in the Brevard County jail in nearby Sharpes
since Aug. 30, held on $1 million bond in the assault case. He
hasn't been charged in connection with the Gainesville stabbing
deaths.
   He has not been charged in connection with the stabbings of four
female students and one male student in Gainesville. Police say he
is one of several suspects in the case, and have made widely
reported searches of his home.
   Defense and prosecution attorneys asked potential jurors what
they had read, heard or seen about the Gainesville case.
   One potential juror, elementary school teacher Phyllis Guarino,
said she was aware that Humphrey was charged here with beating his
grandmother, 79-year-old Elna Hlavaty. She also had heard he has
been named as a suspect in the late-August slayings in Gainesville.
   ``I don't know which is true,'' she said. ``(Even) if he didn't
do it, he's a very sick boy.''
   At the noon recess, Mrs. Hlavaty repeated earlier statements
that her grandson is innocent. She added that she couldn't
understand why the case is being tried when she asked that the
charges be dropped.
   ``The state's attorney has harassed me and my family so terribly
that they should be in a cell,'' she said. ``He sure did not hit
me, and he knows that he did not hit me.''
   Humphrey started the fall semester at the University of Florida
in Gainesville on Aug. 25, the day before a three-day series of
discoveries of the bodies.
   He was arrested five days later when he walked into his
grandmother's Indialantic home in the early morning hours and,
according to police reports, yelled, ``You are going to hell and
you are going to die.'' He began choking her and pummeling her
face, according to a sheriff's report.
   ``I hit her and I'm sorry,'' he reportedly told deputies who
were called to the home by his mother. The grandmother was treated
for broken facial bones and a swollen eye.
   She later said she'd hurt herself in a fall.
   Since he has been in jail, Humphrey has been charged with two
more crimes, a 1988 attempted rape and burglary in Indian River
County and the Aug. 25 assault on two male students at the
University of Florida.

<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garry Kasparov's defense of
his title against blood rival Anatoly Karpov is a $3 million war of
personalities, politics and playing styles.
   The two went head to head Monday night at the Hudson Theatre in
Manhattan, where some 700 seats for the opening match were sold out
-at $25, $50 and $100 each. The first match of the championship
began at 5:30 p.m.
   Kasparov, 27, ended Karpov's 10-year world chess reign in 1985.
Now, Karpov, 39, is trying to wrest the title back as the nemeses
meet for the first time in three years.
   It is the first world championship in the United States since
1907. After the first 12 games are played in New York, 12 more will
be played in Lyon, France, beginning Nov. 24.
   For the New York showdown, the theater is hung with the flags of
the United States, France and the Soviet Union, home country of
both players.
   Above the stage is a 10-foot screen bearing the image of a chess
board. When Kasparov or Karpov makes a move, the pieces on the
screen move, too, for the audience's benefit.
   Two video screens show close-ups of the players. The
computerized chess board will record every move they make.
   The board is atop a stark, black table, with two name tags
pasted on the front.
   One, labeled ``A. Karpov,'' depicts the Soviet flag. Next to the
table is Karpov's black, high-backed easy chair, which swivels and
rolls.
   On the opposite side is a black, low-backed, office-style chair.
That side is labeled ``G. Kasparov,'' with a depiction of the flag
of the Russian Republic.
   Kasparov, founder of a Soviet democratic party, declared last
week he was playing under the flag of the republic rather than the
Soviet Union as a political statement. Karpov often has been quoted
as saying, ``I have two loves: communism and chess.''
   ``Normally, chess is a battle between two individuals: a brutal,
intellectual battle,'' Kasparov said earlier. ``But in my case,
with Karpov, it's a fight between two different mentalities in
Russia. I identify him with the system I've been fighting.''
   Years ago, a chess analyst likened Kasparov's agile, bold style
to the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Karpov's methodical, rigid
style to former Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev.
   The two are as different in personality as they are in political
leanings.
   Kasparov, who beat ``Deep Thought,'' a chess-playing computer,
in New York last January, is confident, flamboyant and fluent in
English - a media darling who tirelessly publicizes chess.
   The media have often described Karpov as cool or even cold: an
introvert who plays with surgical precision and tunes out the
audience. But he was personable at a news conference last Tuesday,
hamming it up and presenting a copy of his book to Kasparov.
   The first championship between the two, in 1984, was abruptly
helted by the World Chess Federation president after Karpov lost
two games in a row. In a controversial move, the World Chess
Federation permitted Karpov to retain the title although the match
wasn't completed.
   Kasparov won their 1985 rematch, becoming the youngest champion
ever. He successfully defended the title against Karpov in 1986. In
1987, their championship match ended in a tie and Kasparov retained
his title under the match rules.
   This time, the winner will receive $1.7 million and the loser
will get $1.3 million. Kasparov aid his earnings will fund ``my
private interests and the political interests of the world.''
Karpov has talked about helping Chernobyl victims and promoting
chess in schools.

<HEAD>Kid Reporters Get First Interview With Retired Justice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of young reporters scored a
journalistic coup by interviewing retired U.S. Supreme Court
Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who told them he was not sure he
could ``fully agree'' with the choice of his successor.
   After suffering a stroke, Brennan retired in July under doctor's
orders to reduce his workload and decline all interviews until at
least next year.
   But five reporters and editors from the Indianapolis Children's
Express bureau spent 30 minutes last month interviewing the
84-year-old Brennan, the most powerful liberal voice on an
increasingly conservative court. Their interview was published in
Monday's Indianapolis Star.
   The team peppered Brennan with questions about children's
rights, abortion, drug testing, the death penalty for minors and
the mentally retarded, the Equal Rights Amendment and his
replacement on the court, David H. Souter, who was confirmed last
week.
   They said Brennan dodged most questions on the newest justice,
but indicated he wasn't pleased with him.
   ``I could hope that the philosophy of the appointment was
something with which I could fully agree, but I'm not sure that I
can say that,'' Brennan said.
   ``It wasn't so much like we were scooping anybody. We were just
talking,'' said Wendy Potasnik, 17.
   ``It was more like a conversation than an interview,'' agreed
Lisa Schubert, 10. ``I mean, I'd ask him the same questions as if
I'd ran into him one day.''
   The interview was arranged with the help of Brennan's daughter,
Nancy, who is a friend of Peter Sterling, president of The
Children's Museum. The museum houses the Children's Express bureau,
which publishes a one-page, weekly report in The Indianapolis Star
on issues of interest to youngsters.
   The Children's Express organization has bureaus in several U.S.
cities as well as Australia and New Zealand, said Lynn Sygiel, the
adult who oversees the group's Indianapolis bureau.
   The New York-based organization used to publish a magazine but
now syndicates its material, as well as publishing a newsletter for
the children involved in the organization, she said.
   Brennan gave the children a warm welcome at his office in the
Supreme Court building in Washington. The Sept. 28 session ended
with Brennan dressed in a bright red Children's Express sweatshirt
and mugging for a camera.
   Before interviewing Brennan, the young reporters carefully
researched his 34-year tenure on the bench. Ms. Sygiel said the
team met twice a week for six weeks reviewing newspaper and
magazine articles on Brennan and some of the more than 1,200
opinions he wrote.
   After the interview, the Express team said Brennan's diminutive
stature and informal air surprised them.
   Kia Woodson, 11, said she expected to hear long, windy answers
laced with legal jargon. Instead the group got brief responses,
which they characterized as evasive and talking down to them.
   Despite the short answers, the young journalists felt they
gained something positive from the experience.
   ``Brennan has done so much in the last 34 years, seeing him, it
doesn't make me understand the Constitution, but it makes me
understand why it's the way it is,'' said Rob Merrill, 15.

   Hundreds of people protesting secret intelligence
operations in a united Germany gathered Monday in Leipzig, the
cradle of last year's East German pro-democracy movement.
   The German news agency ADN said the protest against the
demonstration occurred following evening prayers in the St. Nicolas
Church in central Leipzig, about 70 miles southwest of Berlin.
   Some of the protests specifically targeted the BND, the former
West German intelligence agency that now oversees the unified
country. One of the banners held by the demonstrators said, ``A
democratic state needs no secret service.'' The protesters included
some who held vigils last year in front of the headquarters of the
former East German secret police, known as the Stasi.
   On Oct. 9, 1989, about 70,000 people took part on the first of
what became known as the ``Monday demonstrations.''
   Civic groups in East Germany had demanded only citizens from
that country be allowed access to some of the 6 million files
collected by the former Communist rulers.
   But federal investigators began combing the headquarters of the
Stasi just three days after unity on Oct. 3.

   A weather system spread rain across the south-central part of
the nation Monday after dumping snow on the western Plains and
Rockies, and temperatures fell to record freezing lows in the
north.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across western Arkansas,
eastern and central Oklahoma, and parts of Texas during the
afternoon.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.17 inches at McAlester, Okla., and 0.78 of an inch at Pine Bluff,
Ark.
   Light rain and drizzle prevailed from the central Plains to the
upper Great Lakes.
   Light snow fell across parts of the central high Plains region
after a weekend in which up to 13 inches fell at Colorado's Vail
ski area.
   A record 7.9 inches fell Sunday at Cheyenne, Wyo., nearly
doubling the old record for the date. The snow continued until
early Monday for a weekend total of 10 inches, the National Weather
Service said.
   Snow also fell on parts of western Nebraska, with up to 6 inches
at Scottsbluff.
   Elsewhere, a few showers and thunderstorms were over the Florida
Peninsula and a few showers and thunderstorms moved over Tennessee
and northern Mississippi.
   Brisk Santa Ana wind prevailed across southern California and
along the southern California coast, with gusts to 35 mph at
Ontario and to 37 mph at Needles.
   Temperatures were in the 80s across the Gulf Coast and the
desert Southwest, with readings above 90 over parts of Texas. And
temperatures were in the 70s and 80s along the Atlantic seaboard as
far north as southern New England.
   But much colder weather prevailed from the northern and central
Plains to the upper Great Lakes, where afternoon temperatures were
only in the 30s and 40s, and in parts of the West where readings
were only in the 40s and 50s.
   Overnight readings dipped below 32 degrees in the Great Basin of
Nevada and western Utah and the Rockis, in the central high Plains
region, and from the northern high Plains to Upper Michigan.
   Bismarck, N.D., tied its record low of 15, set in 1895;
International Falls, Minn., hit a record 21; Pocatello, Idaho, hit
a record 21; and Winnemucca, Nev., tied its record of 16.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 7 above zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

<TEXT>
   The Washington Redskins aren't trying to
downplay the importance of their first meeting this season with the
New York Gaints.
   ``This is our biggest test of the season, a huge game as far as
confidence for us,'' guard Mark Schlereth said as the Redskins
returned to practice Monday after their one-week bye.
   ``They're 4-0 and we've been on a roll,'' said defensive end
Fred Stokes. ``Everything the fans and the media say about this
being a big game is true.''
   The Giants, who play at Washington this Sunday, have beaten the
Redskins in seven of the last eight strike games and have won the
last four by a total of 14 points.
   The Redskins haven't been to the playoffs since the last time
they beat the Giants, in 1987, and their 3-1 record puts them once
again behind New York in the NFC Eastern Division standings.
   The Redskins play the Giants twice in the next three weeks.
Their two games against Philadelphia come up in the next month,
too, giving Washington four games against the top two division
contenders in a five-week span.
   ``It's going to be a challenge,'' said quarterback Stan
Humphries, who will be starting only his second NFL game Sunday at
RFK Stadium. ``It's probably going to be the biggest challenge I've
ever had.''
   A sign of the importance the Redskins place on the game was the
intensity around their training facility Monday. In security
reminiscent of the old George Allen era, a couple of aides
patrolled fences next to woods surrounding the practice field and
one shooed away some families who peeked through holes in the
fence.
   The Redskins' frustration the last two years have been
crystalized in their losses to the Giants.
   Last year, Raul Allegre kicked a 52-yard field goal as time
expired to beat them 27-24 in Washington and Phil Simms threw a
couple of fourth-quarter touchdown passes to win the second game
20-17.
   In these days of run-and-shoot offenses, the Redskins and Giants
both play physical defense and preach ball control on offense.
   ``It's always a classic,'' said defensive tackle Darryl Grant,
``a knock-down, drag-out brawl, two fighters in the ring going for
it.''
   ``If you're going to win the conference you have to beat the
Giants and the Eagles,'' said Schlereth. ``We haven't beaten them
in the last two years. You don't want to start losing too many in a
row or it starts to be a jinx.''
   The Redskins' success at grinding out 179 yards rushing against
Phoenix - after depending on wide-open passing formations in the
first three games - may have been a dress rehearsal for the New
York game. The Giants have used their methodical offense to hold
the ball an average of more than 10 minutes longer than their
opponents.
   ``We're going to have to try to keep our defense off the
field,'' said Humphries, who enters the game with only 48 career
pass attempts. ``It's tough against them when you don't control the
ball.
   ``They try to stop the longer throws and make you pick your way
down the field. If you drive, you have to have 11 or 12 good plays
in a row,'' said Humphries.
   That could mean 11 or 12 plays in a row against Lawrence Taylor
and the strong Giant defense.
   ``There's so many things you can't do with him that you would
normally do with a regular outside linebacker,'' said coach Joe
Gibbs. ``They have two great backers and that allows their
secondary to play soft and not take chances. You can't run on them
and their secondary takes away the big play.''
   Gibbs was preparing his team after a weekend off and only light
practices last week.
   ``It's hard for me to judge'' the effect of the layoff, said
Gibbs. ``I don't think we'll know until we get in a game.''

<TEXT>
   David H. Souter, a day away from becoming
history's 105th Supreme Court justice, swore Monday to uphold the
Constitution and pass it on to future generations ``in as vigorous
condition as I have received it.''
   Souter, a 51-year-old judge from New Hampshire, took the oath in
a brief White House ceremony in which President Bush praised his
first nominee to the high court as ``a very thoughtful and caring
man.''
   Bush, alluding to the budget crisis that has trimmed federal
services and threatened to shut down the government, invited guests
to attend a bare-bones reception afterward.
   The impasse has caused a shutdown of all but ``essential''
government services, reducing the White House staff to about
one-sixth its normal size.
   Joking that a Spartan gathering might appeal to Souter's Yankee
upbringing in New Hampshire, the president said it would be
``reception without a lot of largesse.''
   Souter's oath-taking was a preliminary step. He will not become
a justice until he is sworn in Tuesday morning in a separate
ceremony at the Supreme Court.
   The oath, administered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, is
one all federal employees must take. The chief justice will
administer a second oath, taken by all federal judges, in Tuesday's
Supreme Court ceremony.
   After receiving a warm, standing ovation from those in the White
House East Room, Souter demonstrated the soft-spoken humility that
helped him win easy Senate confirmation.
   He recounted how 11 weeks ago when Bush nominated him he was
practically in a state of shock. The president and Mrs. Bush
offered him a drink to revive his flagging spirits and then Bush
telephoned Souter's mother in New Hampshire, Souter said.
   The justice-to-be recalled how Bush told Souter's mother,``I
want you to know he's OK. We'll look after him.''
   ``That epitomizes why my sense of gratitude goes beyond anything
that could be called official,'' Souter said.
   Monday's ceremony was notable for the praise showered on Justice
William J. Brennan, whose retirement in July opened the way for
Souter's nomination.
   Brennan sat in the front row facing Bush as the president
described him as ``one of the most personally beloved and respected
members of the court.''
   Brennan often has been reviled by conservatives as a ymbol of
liberal judicial activism.
   But Souter said Monday he hopes to pass on the Constituion ``in
as vigorous condition as I have received it this afternoon, as it
were, from Justice Brennan.''
   In the Supreme Court's ornate courtroom Tuesday, Souter was to
pledge to ``do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''
   His working career at the court was to start soon thereafter,
when the justices were to begin the 1990-91 term's second week of
hearing arguments in cases to be decided by July.
   Souter is expected to move the court further to the right.
   Brennan, on the court for 34 years, was its leading liberal.
Souter, in a recent interview with The Boston Globe, described
himself as ``a moderate conservative.''
   ```I wouldn't ... put myself smack in the middle ... closer to
the center than some but still on the right side,'' Souter was
quoted as saying.
   He joins a court deeply divided over such contentious issues as
abortion, affirmative action and church-state relations.
   In three days of testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Souter divulged little about his views on such issues,
but the Senate confirmed him by a 90-9 vote anyway.
   In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Souter said
the court's members were eager for him to join them to avoid the
possibility of tied votes in controversial cases.
   ``They very much wanted me to start sitting on Tuesday because
there is always the possibility of a 4-4 decision if they're
sitting without the full complement,'' Souter said. ``The
difficulty with that is if the case has to be reargued, everybody
knows that the whole reargument is going to be addressed to the one
judge who is sort of there to make the difference.''
   Before being named a federal appeals court judge by Bush earlier
this year, Souter spent seven years as a member of the New
Hampshire Supreme Court. He previously had served as a trial judge
and as his state's attorney general.
   At last report, Souter had not yet found a place to live in the
nation's capital. But Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., was helping him
look for a home he could rent.
   Souter also does not yet have a permanent staff, having been
assigned only a temporary secretary and a temporary messenger. Each
justice is allowed four law clerks, two secretaries and a
messenger.
   Souter said earlier he hoped to select his law clerks by next
week.
   His suite of offices is waiting for him - those Justice Antonin
Scalia recently gave up when he moved into Brennan's old chambers.
   The gold-plated name put on the door days ago says ``Justice
Souter'' but court officials, seemingly not willing to rush things,
elected to keep the nameplate covered with adhesive paper until
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Soviet Coast Guard Boards Greenpeace Ship off Nuclear Test Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greenpeace ship in Barents Sea off the Novaya
Zemlya islands was stopped and boarded by the Soviet coast guard
after it sent environmentalists ashore to a nuclear test site.
   According to activists and Soviet officials, KGB border guards
aboard an icebreaker fired several warning shots to deter the
Dutch-registered MV Greenpeace in the two-island group in the
arctic about 370 miles from Norway.
   The islands were a primary Soviet nuclear test site from 1958 to
1963. Environmentalists claim it was last used in 1988. Recent
protests forced the Soviets to suspend tests at their main site in
Soviet Central Asia, rekindling interest in Novaya Zemlya.
   The Greenpeace vessel was detained for ``deliberate violation of
the state border of the U.S.S.R., failure to obey border
authorities, landing people at unpermitted places and an attempt to
enter an area closed to navigation,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said at a briefing.
   Before communications with the ship were lost, Greenpeace
activist Steve Shallhorn said about 15 guards boarded the 190-foot
vessel after the protesters sent four members ashore in rubber
rafts. He said the icebreaker threatened to open fire on the
Greenpeace ship.
   Greenpeace said the activists reached the island in the dark
while others in two decoy rafts distracted the icebreaker crew.
   The environmental group claims new nuclear tests are planned on
Novaya Zemlya, and they intended to demonstrate there.
   The activists put three boats in the water with crew members
inside, the statement said. It did not say what happened to them.
The weather was very bad with heavy seas when the icebreaker, named
the 26th Congress of the Communist Party, detained the Greenpeace
ship, the statement said.
   It said the MV Greenpeace will be escorted to the Kola Gulf,
where an investigation of the border violation will be conducted.
   Shannon Fagan of Greenpeace in London said the group was told by
the Soviet government that a warship would be sent to tow the
vessel to a Soviet port if it did not leave the area under its own
power.
   ``We are not planning to leave,'' she said.
   Shallhorn said from Oslo, Norway, the ship was about four miles
from the island when the rubber rafts were dispatched.
   ``We don't know if they are aware that our party went ashore. We
are going to try to stay in the area until we get our landing party
back, which could take a couple days,'' he said.
   The MV Greenpeace, with 38 Western activists and six Soviets
aboard, had permission to tour the Soviet arctic, Greenpeace said.

   A truck filled with religious pilgrims
overturned on the PanAmerican Highway, killing 25 passengers and
seriously injuring two others, police said Monday.
   The accident, which took place 215 miles southeast of Lima,
occurred Sunday night, police said.
   Police quoted survivors as saying the truck careened off the
highway when the driver was apparently blinded by the headlights of
an oncoming car.
   The truck was carrying pilgrims returning to Nazca, an
archaelogical desert site, from the Virgin of Yauca religious
festival in Yauca, a city about 60 miles south of Nazca.
   The portion of the highway between the two cities twists through
the arid foothills of the Andes and edges past deep ravines.
   Police were unable to confirm how many survived the accident.

   Discovery's five astronauts enjoyed
another quiet but productive day in space Monday, conducting
experiments and beaming down a special birthday greeting to a crew
member's wife.
   The men - calling themselves ``The Discovery Chorus'' - sang
``Happy Birthday'' to Kaye Akers, wife of astronaut Tom Akers, who
turned 34 Monday. They floated in front of a shuttle TV camera
during the short serenade.
   Discovery put NASA back in the space flight business when it
lifted off Saturday on the first shuttle mission in nearly half a
year. The launch ended the fleet's second-longest grounding ever
and was topped several hours later by the successful deployment of
the sun probe Ulysses.
   Ulysses continued to streak through the solar system Monday on
its way to Jupiter. The giant planet will provide a gravity assist
and push the satellite into an orbit over the sun's unexplored
poles.
   The $250 million European spacecraft is expected to pass over
the sun's south pole in 1994 and the north pole in 1995.
   Mission Control's Kathy Thornton informed the crew before they
went to sleep that Ulysses still was doing ``great - no changes.''
   After months of trouble on just about all fronts, NASA officials
said they were delighted to have such a smooth flight. Flight
director Ron Dittemore described it as one of the ``cleanest''
shuttle missions ever.
   ``The greatest pleasure comes when you work a flight and
everything goes perfectly nominal,'' Dittemore said. ``Hopefully,
we're getting better every time we go.''
   Discovery is scheduled to land Wednesday morning at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.
   Before bursting into song with his crew Monday, Discovery's
commander, Richard N. Richards, referred to Sunday's experiment
involving a small, controlled fire aboard the shuttle. Akers
conducted the test.
   ``We don't have a birthday cake on board,'' Richards said in the
broadcast to Mrs. Akers. ``NASA doesn't let us start fires except
for Tom. He's the only one who's been able to start an authorized
fire.''
   ``We don't have any other fires on board, so we had to come up
with something special here for you, Kaye. This is one of the fine
bakery products provided by the NASA bakery,'' Richards said. A
plastic stick that reflects light, poked into a piece of
space-issue bakery goods, mimicked a candle on a cake.
   After the performance, Thornton told the men: ``I don't think
the New Kids in Space are going to replace the New Kids on the
Block as the teen heartthrobs, but we appreciate it anyway.'' NASA
invited Mrs. Akers and other crew members' relatives to see the
tape Monday afteroon at Mission Control in Houston.
   After viewing the tape and another one showing the astronauts
eating dinner and relaxing at the end of their work day, the
families sent up this message: ``You guys are really getting good
at throwing unusual birthday parties. How in the world are you
going to top this one next year?''
   Earlier Monday, the mood aboard the shuttle was less lively.
Astronauts Bruce Melnick and Bill Shepherd began another test of an
experimental system using voice commands to control TV cameras.
   Shepherd reported better success than he had on Sunday, but said
the system is still missing many of the voice commands. He said he
would readjust his microphone for the system's third and final test
on Tuesday.
   On the ground, NASA was busy preparing for the next shuttle
flight. The grounded Columbia was moved Monday from one launch pad
to the other so Atlantis can be transported from the hangar to the
vacated pad later this week.
   Atlantis is scheduled to lift off on a secret military mission
in early November. NASA officials said they expect the launch to be
delayed only a day or so by damage caused by a metal beam that was
left inside the shuttle by workers last week.

   Iraq's ruling party on Monday threatened to
retaliate after Israeli police shot and killed at least 19
Palestinians in a clash in Jerusalem.
   ``This vicious crime will not go without retaliation, and the
Arab nation is certainly capable to retaliate and it will,'' said
Al-Thawra, the official newspaper of Iraq's Arab Baath Socialist
Party.
   In an editorial for Tuesday's paper, obtained by The Associated
Press on Monday, Al-Thawra described the killings as ``a massacre
that has been made possible with American aid and support to
Israel.''
   ``It will turn into a massive wave of indignation, which will
take the pan-Arab struggle a step toward the liberation of
Jerusalem and all other holy places and claim the Arab homeland
from treachery and occupation,'' the editorial said.
   Iraq has claimed Saudi Arabia has desecrated Islam's holiest
shrines at Mecca and Medina by allowing the U.S.-led multinational
force on Saudi territory, in reaction to the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2
of Kuwait.
   Israeli Police Minister Roni Milo said 19 people died and 140
were injured in Israel's bloodiest rioting in 23 years. Witnesses
said the clash erupted after Palestinians threw stones from the
Temple Mount on Jews worshiping below at the Western Wall,
Judaism's holiest site. The Temple Mount is home of the al-Aqsa
Mosque, Islam's third holiest site.
   ``Where is the international legality, which Washington has
always said that it is keen to implement?'' the paper asked. ``The
racist massacre in Al Aqsa mosque reveals that the national
legality has always been an instrument by the United States to
impose its hegemony and not to be used in defense of the people who
fight racism and fascism.''

   Visitors got in free Monday at the Grand Canyon and some other
national parks because there was no one at the gates to collect
fees, and some Coast Guardsmen were told to stay ashore to save
fuel.
   Many other national parks and monuments were closed or without
services, however, as non-essential federal workers stayed home
because the government didn't have authority to pay them.
   If the impasse on Capitol Hill weren't resolved, the full impact
of the shutdowns would hit Tuesday, when federal offices reopen
after the three-day Columbus Day weekend. Most of the 2.4 million
federal workers were told to report to work Tuesday, but without a
budget agreement most would likely be sent home soon afterward.
   Richard Darman, the White House budget director, said workers
performing services needed to ``protect life and property'' would
stay on the job, but even some of those federal employees saw
changes.
   The Coast Guard station in Michigan City, Ind., on the shore of
Lake Michigan, reported it was ordered to save fuel by stopping its
daily training maneuvers.
   FBI agents were told late last week that as many as half of the
400 employees in the Chicago office could be furloughed on
Thursday, Friday and Oct. 15.
   ``We will have agents available for kidnappings, hostage
situations, bank robberies - emergency situations,'' said FBI
spokesman Robert Long. ``This could hurt some of our long-term
investigations, though.''
   Locked gates at the Vicksburg National Military Park in
Mississippi angered tourists.
   ``I'm going home to vote against my congressman,'' said Bobby
Denton, 52, of Jena, La.
   Services at Grand Canyon National Park were cut back to the most
critical, and even the switchboard was shut down.
   But the main gate remained open Monday, so visitors got in
without paying the usual $10 per car or $5 per person fees.
   ``We got a lot of questions asking what was open and what
services there were. But for the people who visited, it was a good
deal, because they got in free,'' said William Bohannon, general
manager of the privately operated Grand Canyon National Park Lodges
on the canyon's South Rim.
   Tourists also got in free at Everglades National Park in Florida
after ticket takers were sent home.
   About 3,500 tourists visited the Antietam National Battlefield
at Sharspburg, Md., during the three-day weekend, many attracted by
the recent Public Broadcasting Service series on the Civil War,
only to find it closed.
   The crowd estimate was made Monday by park superintendent
Richard Rambur, who was not working but made a brief stop at his
office. ``Somebody is beating on my window now to use the
bathroom.''
   Tourists were ousted from visitors' centers and campgrounds in
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee.
   Privte campgrounds and hotels outside the park were jammed. But
the campground and hotel managers and other merchants said they
were afraid their windfall would be short-lived if the budget
impasse isn't resolved.
   ``Obviously it's a disadvantage to us not to have the park
open,'' said Randy Fiveash, executive director of the Gatlinburg
Chamber of Commerce.
   The Eisenhower Library and home in Abilene, Kan., remained open.
They are run by the National Archives and Records Administration,
said director Richard Norton Smith. ``We're taking it one day at a
time,'' he said.
   The Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Mo., also wasn't
immediately affected, said acting director George Curtis.
   ``Our instructions are to still be open to the public through
Monday,'' Curtis said.
   Visitors to the Gateway Arch in St. Louis were turned away.
Jerry Schober, superintendent of the Jefferson National Expansion
Memorial, estimated Monday that the Arch had lost $15,000 to
$20,000 in admission fees since it was closed Saturday.
   In the nation's capital, the Mall, normally swarming with
tourists making their way through the Smithsonian Institution's
museums and galleries, had just joggers, pigeons and a few
out-of-town visitors.
   Trash littered the Mall because federal cleanup crews weren't
working.
   ``I don't think it's a good representation for our country,''
said Ken Thomas of Baltimore, who took his mother-in-law, visiting
from Germany, to Washington despite the shutdown. He said she was
disgusted by the litter.
   Mike Podett of San Francisco, who had hoped to tour the
Smithsonian museums on his vacation, said Congress and the White
House were both to blame for his ruined trip.
   ``They're acting like a bunch of little children, saying, `It's
my way or no way,' '' he said.

<HEAD>Police Seeking Kitchen Porter Missing Since Bomb Found at Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they were seeking a 21-year-old
employee of a London club who had been absent from work since the
morning an IRA bomb was found at an anti-terrorism conference.
   Scotland Yard detectives said they wanted to question Gerrard
McGarrigle of Belfast, who worked in the kitchen of the Royal
Overseas League Club where the bomb was found and defused Sept. 27.
   ``He had been employed by the club for a year but was last seen
on Sept. 27 when he left without giving notice,'' said a Scotland
Yard spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``He has not returned to his London address and extensive
inquiries have so far failed to trace him,'' he said.
   Robert Newell, general manager of the club, said McGarrigle had
been thoroughly checked by a senior member of staff and had worked
up until then without any problems.
   A television sound engineer happened to find the bomb under the
speaker's lectern before the start of the one-day conference. It
was timed to explode minutes after the conference opened and would
probably have killed several people, police said.
   Later, the outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility
for planting the bomb, saying it had been aimed at Foreign Office
Minister William Waldegrave. Waldegrave had been scheduled to speak
first at the conference although his speech was switched to the
afternoon at the last minute.
   The IRA, which has been fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, has recently escalated its
attacks on the British mainland.

   There was still one chef per shift at the
White House on Monday. The astronauts aboard Discovery were working
overtime and government lawyers were preparing to argue before the
Supreme Court. They're essential, unaffected by the government
shutdown.
   In fact, many thousands of federal employees - ranging from meat
inspectors to press secretaries to U.S. troops in the Middle East -
remained on the job after government authorization to pay them
expired Friday night.
   Most federal workers were off for the Columbus Day holiday on
Monday and wouldn't know for sure until Tuesday morning whether
their bosses considered them essential or not. Agency heads were
spared hearing that ego-deflating or boosting news because they
were making the decisions.
   ``It really gets to be nebulous,'' said John Sturdivant,
president of the 700,000-member American Federation of Government
Employees. ``Theoretically, you might have a person doing
scheduling or answering the phone for a Cabinet secretary who is
deemed essential, but then you could have some undersecretary who's
doing policy and planning who is not.''
   In general, federal workers were told to report to work Tuesday
morning, then use about three hours for ``phase-down activities''
before going home - if they were ruled nonessential and if a budget
agreement had not been reached to keep normal government operations
going.
   Sturdivant said no one had ever pulled together figures on what
percentage of the 2.4 million strong federal work force was
considered essential. One official who declined to be identified by
name or agency said the Office of Management and Budget had
promulgated guidelines to the effect that normally only 15 percent
of a civilian agency should be considered essential.
   This could not be confirmed immediately. Spokesmen for OMB were
not in their offices.
   Fifteen percent would mean 360,000 people would stay on the job
and about 2 million would be sent home. However, in past shutdowns
only a few hundred thousand have gone home.
   Some departmental details were available Monday.
   For example, the Defense Department said all military and
civilian operations related to Desert Shield, the deployment in the
Persian Gulf, would be exempt.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said air traffic controllers
would be working as usual.
   They are exempt, as are most of the 103,000 employees under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, including those
responsible for health and safety and uniformed members of the
Coast Guard.
   Department officials said they expect about 20,000 workers to be
sent home while most others won't be affected, either because they
are paid out of non-appropriated funds or previously approved
multi-year appropriations.
   A notable exception: Certain inspectors are not exempt and
inspections of hazardous materials and pipelines would not take
place.
   Rule making and contract writing also would stop, said Robert S.
Marx, the department's director of public information.
   At the National Zoo, a spokeswoman said workers who feed the
animals and clean up after them were essential.
   At the White House, a spokesman said 65 out of 383 employes
would be classified as essential. They include all assistants to
the president, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater and his top aides,
and the legislative staff working with Congress to resolve the
budget impasse.
   The staff of 70 in the family living quarters at the White House
was cut to 10, including one chef, one engineer and one maid per
shift.
   The Marine guard who usually stands outside the door to the West
Wing was absent from his post.
   But when Bush attended the wedding of his personnel chief, Chase
Untermeyer, on Saturday, a low-ranking press aide was dispatched to
shepherd reporters.
   Discovery's five-man crew didn't need any orders. They just
continued working 16-hour shifts. Also continuing at their posts
were the ground controllers in Houston and crews preparing for the
shuttle's landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Wednesday.
   Lawyers from the solicitor general's office are scheduled to
present the government's views Tuesday when the Supreme Court hears
arguments on a question of securities law and a case involving
suits by workers. David Souter will be hearing his first cases on
the high court after his swearing-in Monday.
   The Justice Department plans to keep 60,000 of its 80,000
employees working, said a department official. Law enforcement
agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service would be considered
essential personnel along with federal prison guards, he said.
   The nation's 94 U.S. attorneys' offices would stay open and more
than half the prosecutors and attorneys would continue to work.
   Under the Constitution, judges' pay cannot be decreased. The
nation's federal courts, therefore, will continue to function with
only some cuts in the work of some clerks, said David Sellers, a
spokesman for the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts.
   At the Agriculture Department, officials said the only clear-cut
exception to the shutdown was the federal meat and poultry
inspection system. Press secretary Kelly Shipp said county offices
of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which
handles commodity subsidies, and the Farmers Home Administration,
which makes loans to low-income farmers, would be closed.
   Labor Department spokeswoman Johanna Schneider said about 3,000
of the agency's 18,100 employes are considered essential. The
figure includes 1,800 employes of the Mine Safety and Health
Administration, who conduct day-to-day monitoring of mines.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate at which Americans died from accidents
decreased an estimated 21 percent in the last decade, according to
a group that promotes safety. Experts attributed the improvement to
seat belt laws, smoke alarm requirements and other toughened safety
regulations.
   The National Safety Council, a public service organization with
headquarters here, reports that accidents still rank as the fourth
leading cause of death, as they were at the beginning of the 1980s.
   But the combination of new laws and lower public tolerance for
unsafe behavior at home, at work and especially behind the wheel of
a car has improved Americans' safety record, said Alan Hoskin,
director of the council's statistics department.
   ``In general, people are demonstrating more concern for safety
in numerous aspects of their lives,'' Hoskin said Monday.
   The number of fatal accidents went from 105,312 in 1979 to an
estimated 94,500 in 1989, a decrease of 10 percent, according to
figures the council released in August.
   To arrive at the 21 percent decline, statisticians used the
overall number of fatalities, calculated a rate per 100,000 people
and adjusted that rate for the fact that there are more elderly now
- a factor which could tend to inflate the rate.

   Tom Borchard credits big seeds and
``just a little fertilizer'' with helping him grow a 544-pound
pumpkin that weighed in Monday as the heaviest at the 20th annual
Great Pumpkin Weigh-Off.
   Borchard, 46, of Salinas, who has grown the winning pumpkin six
times, has a simple plan: ``I just keep the biggest seeds out of
the biggest ones and they just keep getting bigger on me.''
   ``Just a little fertilizer, a lot or water and pray a lot,'' he
said. The seeds are about twice as big as regular pumpkin seeds,
Borchard said.
   Borchard said he and his three sons - ``who are pretty good
sized'' - struggled to load the pumpkin onto a pallet. After that,
they used a forklift to transport the oversized squash, which is
about 4 feet across.
   The all-time record at the community event, which also draws
contestants from other states, weighed more than 600 pounds, said
contest spokeswoman Sarah Williams.
   Borchard plans to carve the pumpkin into a jack-o-lantern, but
won't bake any pies. That's because the seed variety he uses -
Atlantic Giant - is good for size but too stringy for a good
filling, Borchard said, adding: ``We make pies out of a can.''

<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned
Monday the clashes in Jerusalem that left at least 19 Palestinians
dead could lead to ``grave consequences'' in the Middle East.
   Mubarak's statement, which was delivered on Cairo television,
was apparently referring to the Persian Gulf standoff between Iraq
and the U.S.-led multinational force.
   Earlier Monday, Iraq's ruling Baath party threatened to
retaliate for the killings.
   In his statement, Mubarak warned the shootings could ``lead to
grave consequences in the present critical circumstances engulfing
the area.'' Cairo television interrupted its regular programing to
deliver the statement.
   The statement was issued by Mubarak's office and not the foreign
ministry as is usual. It reflected Egypt's fears of a possible
outbreak of Arab-Israeli hostilities at a time when Cairo is
leading Arab opposition to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The statement said Israel's ``savage repressive measures
exceeded all limits'' and added that the Jewish state is ``fully
responsible'' for protecting Islamic shrines in Jerusalem.
   The statement called on ``all parties in Jerusalem to practice
self-restraint.''
   In the Monday incident, Israeli security forces opened fire on
Palestinians near the al-Aqsa mosque after the Arabs stoned Jewish
worshipers at the Western Wall, below the mosque. The Western Wall
is Judaism's holiest site.

<TEXT>
   A white supremacist and his son began
defending themselves Monday against a $10 million lawsuit that
accuses them of inciting the fatal beating of a black man.
   Police in riot gear stood by as Tom Metzger, 52, and his son,
John, 22, jumped from a van and into a sidewalk elevator that took
them to the courtroom of another black man, Multnomah County
Circuit Judge Ancer Haggerty.
   Dozens of helmeted police, some on horseback, stood guard and a
patrol helicopter circled overhead as the Metzgers arrived.
   The violent demonstration police prepared for failed to
materialize, although a few ``skinheads'' - young, white racists
who affect shaved heads and military garb - waited outside the
courthouse. Three young men were arrested outside the courthouse,
two for carrying concealed weapons and one in an earlier assault
case after the victim pointed him out to police as his alleged
attacker.
   Metzger, of Fallbrook, Calif., founded White Aryan Resistance
and is a former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon. He and his son - also
active in the white supremacy movement - are acting as their own
attorneys.
   The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed by the victim's uncle, accuses
the Metzgers of sending agents to Portland to incite violence
against blacks shortly before Mulugeta Seraw, 27, was beaten to
death with a baseball bat in November 1988. Two of the Ethiopian's
friends were severely beaten.
   Three skinheads, all members of the neo-Nazi group East Side
White Pride, were convicted in Seraw's death.
   Before jury selection began Monday, the judge rejected motions
by the Metzgers to exclude various people from testifying. Among
them are police who investigated Seraw's death, the victim's family
and friends and two men Metzger allegedly sent to Portland as his
agents.
   Metzger claimed he has been unable to interview the men, Dave
Mazzella and Michael Barrett. The lawsuit claims they brought
Metzger's message of violence against Jews and blacks to Portland
skinheads.
   Barrett, who said he had since quit the white supremacist
movement, said in a sworn statement filed with the lawsuit that he
and Mazzella spoke to the gang hours before Seraw was killed.
   ``We told them to use violence if they got the opportunity and
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy. We were telling them
what Tom and John Metzger told us to say to skinheads we were
organizing,'' he said.
   The Metzgers deny the accusations.
   The judge rejected Metzger's claim that ``the plaintiffs have
played a hide-and-seek game with Mr. Barrett and Mazzella and we
had no way to depose or cross-examine them.''
   Haggerty reserved judgment on the Metzgers' motion to exclude
certain evidence as constitutionally protected free speech.
   That evidence includes racist television programs Tom Metzger
produces, a telephone hotline he records and newspaper columns he
writes.
   The lawsuit was filed by Engedaw Berhanu, Seraw's uncle. Berhanu
is represented by Elden Rosenthal and attorney Morris Dees of the
Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center.
   Three years ago, Dees won a $7 million jury verdict against the
United Klans of America after two Klansmen from Mobile, Ala.,
killed a 19-year-old black man. The suit was filed on behalf of the
victim's mother.
   Also named in the current wrongful death lawsuit are two of the
three skinheads convicted in Seraw's death, Kenneth Mieske and Kyle
Brewster.
   They and Steven Strasser pleaded guilty in the earlier criminal
case.
   Mieske was sentenced to life with a 20-year minimum, Brewster to
10 to 20 years and Strasser to 20 years.

<TEXT>
   Parliament's upper house on Monday ratified
the six-nation treaty restoring German sovereignty, and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl asked for rapid help in rebuilding the eastern part of
the newly united nation.
   The Bundesrat also gave final approval to a law enabling
national elections to be held Dec. 2.
   The treaty formally ends special rights in Germany of the four
World War II victors - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France. It was ratified without opposition in the Bundesrat
three days after it was approved by the lower house, the Bundestag.
   The document was signed on Sept. 12 in Moscow by the wartime
allies and the two Germanys.
   The new election law replaces an earlier agreement ruled
unconstitutional by the Suprem Court. In effect, the law sets up
two separate election areas in Germany - one in former West Germany
and one in now-defunct East Germany.
   The rejected law would have required parties to win at least 5
percent across Germany for seats in the Bundestag. Under the new
law, parties need to win only 5 percent in either former East
Germany or West Germany.
   Kohl convened a summit of Germany's most powerful business
leaders Monday to issue a personal appeal for quick help in
rebuilding former East Germany.
   ``I have a completely personal request to make of you,'' he told
the assemblage at the Chancellery.
   ``Think over the contribution you and your workers can offer so
that rapid improvements can be achieved.''
   Hopes of huge investment in the former communist nation have not
yet been realized. Unemployment is soaring as unprofitable
businesses and factories close.
   He appealed to his guests to send experienced workers to eastern
Germany to provide badly needed knowledge and advice.
   Kohl said a consensus has to be reached on how to remove
difficulties facing the reconstruction of eastern Germany.
   The two Germanys united last Wednesday, and Kohl made it clear
he wants to quickly build up what was formerly East Germany and
give its people a standard of living more in line with that of the
West.
   Also on Monday, Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said former
high-ranking East German Communist Party officials should be
removed from any key posts they may hold now, the newspaper Die
Welt reported.
   It quoted Schaeuble as saying that former Communists ``who were
once high up and are now again swimming like beads of fat on top of
the soup'' should lose their jobs.
   His comments follow other news reports that some one-time
members of East Germany's secret police now hold official jobs in
the new united Germany.
   Schaeuble made special mention of the official trusteeship
overseeing the privatization of businesses in former East Germany.
   He said former Communist Party officials found working there
would be fired, according to Die Welt.

   A man who feared he was dying of cancer
allegedly robbed $125,000 from a currency exchange and fled after
giving his family most of the money, authorities said Monday.
   Port Authority and New York City police detectives were seeking
Bernard Gamble, 59, of Queens in connection with the Sunday robbery
at a Deak International office at John F. Kennedy International
Airport.
   Gamble had worked at Kennedy Airport for 12 years as a cleaner
for the Pioneer Cleaning Co., said Port Authority spokesman John
Hughes.
   ``He told the people he doesn't want to do this but he's
terminally ill and has to do it,'' said Hughes.
   Gamble was awaiting results of medical tests conducted last
week. His family told police three of his relatives had died of
cancer.
   ``He had been feeling ill for several weeks,'' Port Authority
Sgt. Robert Rodriguez said. ``I guess he just snapped.''
   Gamble allegedly tied up a woman employee with masking tape,
then ordered a male employee to open a safe, said Hughes. He later
tied up the man and escaped with $125,000.
   According to Hughes, Gamble's son later turned over $83,500 to
the police.
   Hughes said the son ``then mentioned that the father had come to
the house and told them that he gave them the money and told the
son to take care of the mother and sister and he was going away and
would not be in touch with them.''
   Gamble was last seen at Newark International Airport, where a
cab driver dropped him off.
   ``He could be anywhere by now,'' Rodriguez said. He said it was
unlikely Gamble had left the country because he didn't have a
passport.

   Mayor David Dinkins promised Monday that his

   Newsweek noted that the bed's arrival at the mayor's official
residence coincided with municipal money woes that led Dinkins to
freeze hiring, propose new taxes and talk about 15,000 layoffs.
   If it costs what Newsweek said, that ``will all be covered by
private donations from friends of the city, many of whom have
contacted me this morning to offer their contributions,'' the mayor
said in a statement issued by his press secretary, Albert Scardino.
   Dinkins said $1,400 in contributions had been received before
the bed, or more specifically its decorated cherry headboard, was
delivered to Gracie Mansion on Friday.
   Newsweek said the bill so far for labor, which was performed by
a carpenter on the payroll of the city Human Resources
Administration, has been just under $6,500 for 266 hours. The
magazine said the final accounting could be for 500 hours at $23 an
hour - $11,500.
   Calls to HRA spokesmen for comment went unanswered Monday, the
Columbus Day holiday.
   A new bedroom set was necessary because former Mayor Edward I.
Koch took the bedroom furniture with him when he left office in
January, said Jennifer Kimball of Dinkins' press office. Koch said
he had brought his own bed with him when he moved in.
   Kimball said Dinkins and his wife, Joyce, bought nightstands and
bureaus at their own expense, but the matching headboard had been
discontinued and they had to have it built.
   Arnold Biegen, chairman of Dinkins' finance committee and a
personal friend, confirmed that the final cost would be borne by
contributors.
   ``While the published labor cost on the face of it is ludicrous,
the mayor's friends will pay for it through donations to the Gracie
Mansion Conservancy,'' said Biegen, a lawyer.
   ``I wish somebody would ask me why don't I seek reimbursement
for the $8,000 or $9,000 I spent on the bedroom suite,'' Dinkins
said. ``No questions have come to me in that regard. I contributed
that.''
   Kimball described the headboard as ``a museum piece'' that will
remain the property of the city.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Warns of Dangers of Inaction on Economic Reforms</HEAD>

   President Mikhail Gorbachev told high-ranking
Communists on Monday they must embrace a market economy or risk
losing power and causing greater party discord.
   Speaking at the opening of a two-day Central Committee meeting,
Gorbachev delivered one of his sternest warnings on reform.
   ``All our previous ideology presented socialism as an antipode
to the market and viewed the recognition of a market as an
encroachment upon socialism,'' Gorbachev said, according to the
state news agency Tass.
   ``Yes, we are encroaching upon socialism, but only socialism
that was built bureaucratically, under which the country veered off
the path it embarked upon in 1917,'' the year of the Bolshevik
Revolution, he said.
   Gorbachev, who also serves as the party's general secretary,
said ``the inertia of old thinking'' is a ``real danger to the
party'' if it hopes to regain the confidence of the people.
   The party ``should help society shed prejudice and fear of the
market,'' he said.
   The meeting of the 400-member Central Committee was its first
since July's larger party congress, which Gorbachev used to bolster
his power.
   But the congress failed to inspire new confidence in the party.
   About 375,000 of its approximately 18 million members have quit
this year, including Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin and
the mayors of Moscow and Leningrad. Another 275,000 people were
either expelled from the party or stopped paying dues and attending
party functions.
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, has hit a low in public opinion polls as
some of the 15 republics exercise more independence.
   Under growing popular pressure, the party earlier this year
surrendered its constitutional monopoly on power.
   Later Monday, deputy party leader Vladimir Ivashko said ``the
party does not renounce socialism'' by encouraging market-oriented
reforms.
   In his speech, Gorbachev blamed the country's problems on the
state monopoly on property and said workers would be given
``reliable'' guarantees they would benefit from the
denationalization of state-run businesses.
   In a sign of the party's troubles concerning property, the
Ternopol city council in the western Ukraine voted Monday to seize
all property belonging to the regional party branch. It transferred
buildings and other assets to control of municipal government
authorities, Tass reported.
   Gorbachev said work on an economic reform plan has entered its
``final stage'' and will incorporate aspects of programs by Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzkhov and economist Stanislav Shatlin, a member
of the advisory Presidential Council.
   ``This will not be some kind of compromise document with rounded
corners and fuzzy positions, but a program able to rally all
sections of society,'' he promised.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature has set up a committee to combine
several programs on rescuing the Soviet economy and report back by
back by Oct. 15.
   The most radical reform proposal, written by Shatalin, calls for
scrapping the central planning system and moving to a market
economy within 500 days by selling factories to private owners and
breaking up collective farms.
   The Ryzhkov plan would leave the government in control of most
of the economy while gradually allowing some free enterprise.
   Gorbachev has backed a compromise that contains many elements of
the 500-day plan, but at a slower pace. He also wants a national
referendum to decide whether to return land to private farmers.
   In his speech, Gorbachev repeated his proposal to draw up a new
union treaty that would grant some autonomy to the 15 Soviet
republics while retaining most power in the Kremlin.
   ``The Soviet Communist Party resolutely opposes separatism,'' he
declared, warning that unless the republics reverse their
secessionist drives the Soviet Union could fall into a fragmented
land of competing groups, which he likened to Lebanon.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Klaus Threatens Bahamas, Lili Forms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Klaus, which strengthened after
being downgraded to a depression, threatened the Bahamas and
contributed to flooding along Florida's Atlantic shores Monday.
   The National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables was also
tracking Tropical Storm Lili, which formed in the central Atlantic
but posed no immediate threat to land.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Klaus had top winds of 40 mph, just over the
threshold of storm strength. Its center was near 22.2 degrees north
latitude and 70.8 degrees west longitude, or about 470 miles
southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas.
   Klaus was moving northwest at 15 mph and was expected to
continue on that track for the next day or two, forecasters said.
   Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the central Bahamas
in the Caribbean, the northern Bahamas were under a tropical storm
watch and a coastal flood watch was in effect for Florida's east
coast and Keys.
   Some increase in strength was likely during the next day for
Klaus, which at one point was strong enough to be the sixth
hurricane of the season.
   The storm was expected to strengthen, but wasn't expected to
move over Florida, said Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane
center. ``We think it's going to move on a northwest course and
most likely will not move over Florida, particularly South
Florida.''
   However, Klaus-related winds were already partly responsible for
beach erosion, rough surf and potentially deadly rip currents along
Florida's eastern coast, and heavy winds and rain elsewhere in the
state, the center said.
   Klaus killed at least six people and left 1,500 homeless in the
northeastern Caribbean before being downgraded Saturday to a
typical storm when its top winds dropped below 73 mph.
   It was downgraded late Sunday to a tropical depression when its
winds dipped below 39 mph.
   Meanwhile, tropical storm Lili at At 6 p.m. was located near
32.7 degrees north latitude and 47.5 degrees west longitude, or
about 1,000 miles west-southwest of the Azores, a group of islands
off Portugal.
   Lili, with top winds near 65 mph, was expected to strengthen
during the next day as it moved southwest at 7 mph, forecasters
said.

<HEAD>Bush's Approval Rating Drops Amid Dissatisfaction With Budget
Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's approval ratings in two polls
reported Monday dropped to the lowest point of the year for each
even though they remained high.
   One poll showed him with the lowest approval rating since he
took office for the second time this year.
   In brief:
   -The ABC-Washington Post poll conducted Thursday through
Saturday showed 65 percent approving the way Bush is handling his
job, down from 75 percent a month earlier and equal to the 65
percent recorded in July. That 65 percent was the lowest approval
rating since Bush took office.
   -The CBS-New York Times poll conducted Sunday gave Bush an
approval rating of 62 percent, down from a peak of 76 percent in
August just after troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.
   Congress fared little better.
   -In the ABC-Washington Post poll, 57 percent said Congress was
more to blame than the president for the budget impasse.
   -In the CBS-New York Times poll, 54 percent blamed the budget
snarl on Congress and the president equally.
   The ABC-Washington Post poll interviewed 775 people and the
CBS-New York Times poll interviewed 756. Both surveys were done by
telephone and reported a likely margin of error of 4 percentage
points either way.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's hamburgers, fries and golden
arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its
first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine.
   Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in
Shenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their first
taste of a McDonald's hamburger, fries or shake.
   ``I travelled for four hours from a village to get here,'' said
Huang Rongti, 70, who has lost most of her teeth because of age.
``You think hamburgers are too challenging for my age?''
   Later, after purchasing her first Big Mac, she inspected it
carefully before taking a bite.
   ``It tastes good, I like it,'' she announced before slowly
eating the rest.
   The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where
cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to
gourmets. It is estimated there are more than 5,000 different
Chinese dishes.
   In Canton, 125 miles northwest of Shenzhen, chefs specialize in
some of the more exotic Chinese dishes, such as cat stew, bear
paws, chicken feet and a famed snake dish - ``Dragon and Tiger
Locked in Battle'' - made from three kinds of poisonous snakes
stewed with leopard meat, and garnished with 20 spices, lemon
leaves and chrysanthemum petals.
   However, many Chinese, who earn an average $32 a month, are
still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants.
   In Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone where foreign
investors have built factories, salaries are higher and workers
earn an average of $53 a month.
   At the restaurant, a Big Mac costs $1.14, a bag of fries 48
cents and a shake 74 cents.
   Another U.S. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, opened a
restaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now has four outlets there.
McDonald's hopes to open a restaurant in Beijing later.
   Although Kentucky Fried Chicken has become popular, the average
Chinese still regards a meal there as a treat, rather than a
convenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems.
   The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building is
operated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly owned
subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong. McDonald's Hong Kong is a 50-50
joint venture with McDonald's in the United States.
   It is managed by a Chinese national, Chen Tikang, and his son,
Chen Yin, who is the restaurant manager. The younger Chen returned
recently from a course at McDonald's hamburger university in Oak
Brook, Ill.
   Most of the ingredients used at the restaurant are now imported
from Hong Kong. But McDonald's executives hope eventually to get
their supplies of beef and potatoes from China.
   Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said
it took two years to prepare for the restaurant's opening and his
ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.
   Last month, when McDonald's advertized for 240 staffers for the
restaurant, it received applications from more than 9,000 persons,
including college graduates, officials said.
   ``I feel I have a better job prospect working here, and it pays
better,'' said Henry He, 25, who has a master's degree in garment
and textile. He is an assistant manager at the restaurant.
   A waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cents an hour.
   A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was able
to purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its ``sweet
taste'' - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly used
in traditional Chinese cooking.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Austria's two largest parties
said Monday they would open talks on continuing their governing
coalition despite the drubbing of the main conservative party in
national elections.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Socialist Party won 43 percent of
the vote Sunday and added one seat in the 183-seat Parliament,
where it now controls 81 seats.
   Vranitzky's coalition partners, the conservative People's Party,
suffered its worst defeat in 45 years, losing 17 of its 77 seats
yet remaining in a pivotal position to decide the makeup of the new
government.
   Vice Chancellor Josef Riegler, leader of the People's Party,
said it would talk to the Socialists about rebuilding the coalition
forged in 1986 rather than turning first to the upstart Freedom
Party and its leader Joerg Haider.
   Haider's party nearly doubled its parliamentary representation
to 33 seats on a platform appealing to nationalist sentiments,
warnings of rising crime and complaints over Austria's relatively
liberal immigration policies for Eastern Europeans.
   The Freedom Party took nearly 17 percent of the popular vote.
   Some in the Peoples' Party had earlier suggested the possibility
of a coalition with the Freedom Party. With 93 seats between them,
they would have one more than the majority.
   Vranitzky reiterated Monday that he would not govern in
partnership with Haider's Freedom Party, which he and his party
consider too far to the right.
   The Socialists had been expected to lose heavily due to a series
of internal scandals, but Vranitzky's extraordinary popularity
appeared to offset the problems.
   Vranitzky's government was to submit its resignation Tuesday
after the regular Cabinet session. President Kurt Waldheim will ask
Vranitzky, as leader of the strongest party, to form a new
government.
   Vranitzky and Riegler met separately with Waldheim on Monday to
discuss the outcome of the election.
   The environmental Green Alternative Party won an additional seat
Sunday for a total of nine.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Extradition Request for Ex-Military President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal court on Monday
rejected a request by Italy to extradite five former military
officers accused of human rights violations during the Argentine
``dirty war,'' including ex-President Jorge Videla.
   The extradition request is ``inadmisible,'' the court ruled,
because the crimes the Italian court wants to prosecute occurred in
Argentina.
   The case stems from the 1978 disappearance of four Argentine
citizens of Italian descent who were last seen in the Atlantic
resort of Mar del Plata, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires.
   Relatives in Italy filed the suit. The court requested the
extraditions last Tuesday.
   Videla and former navy admiral Emilio Massera were convicted by
a federal court and sentenced to life in prison for human rights
abuses committed during the 1976-83 military junta's crackdown on
suspected leftist subversion.
   Of the other three former officers cited, one was convicted of
rights abuses, one is awaiting trial and one was allowed to retire.
   The ``dirty war'' the hard-line military waged against suspected
leftist subversives left at least 9,000 people missing and presumed
dead.

   Tamara Roberts long ago recognized the value of the bone-marrow
transplant research by E. Donnall Thomas, one of two American
doctors awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine. It saved her life.
   In 1972, Roberts was a teen-ager dying of leukemia. Today, at
age 34, she has lived longer than any other leukemia victim who
received a bone marrow transplant.
   ``He is like my dad,'' Roberts said a news conference Monday
with Thomas.
   ``When you've known someone and they've brought you back and
given you another ... 60 years on a silver platter and said just
enjoy, wouldn't you feel close to that person? I know I do.''
   Thomas, 70, and Joseph E. Murray, 71, who performed the first
successful human organ transplant, a kidney, will share the
$704,000 prize.
   Their revolutionary procedures have saved thousands of lives
over three decades. Both said Monday that they were surprised and
grateful for the recognition, but that their lives would be
unchanged by the money.
   Thomas, with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, credited his research team for much of his
accomplishments.
   ``It's a great honor, not only for me but for the team I have
worked with all these years,'' he said.
   Thomas performed the first human bone marrow transplant in 1956.
Initially, the only success came in cases where identical twins
were involved.
   By the early 1970s, however, the years of research began to pay
off. Roberts' donor was her brother.
   Today, the procedure is standard treatment for leukemia and
other diseases.
   Leukemia once was always fatal. Thomas' procedure now produces a
cure in 50 percent of all cases, and in 80 percent of childhood
cases. In 1987 about 4,000 patients received the treatment.
   Murray, in San Francisco for a medical conference, said Monday
he struggled with moral dilemmas four decades ago as he pioneered
transplant surgery, which is now routine but still ethically
complex.
   ``We were stuck with the moral problem of removing a healthy
organ from a healthy person. And this was new then,'' Murray said.
   In 1954, Murray and his team of surgeons at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston removed a healthy kidney from 23-year-old Ronald
Herrick and transplanted it in his identical twin, Richard, in what
was the first such success after 15 failures.
   ``We felt it was worth risking the health of that normal person
... to prevent the death of his twin brother,'' Murray said. ``He
was very anxious to donate. ... The operation was the light at the
end of the tunnel.''
   In 1962, Murray performed the first successful kidney transplant
from an unrelated donor. Now, up to 50,000 organ transplants are
performed each year, 75 percent of them involving kidneys.
   Transplants still present ethical questions, he said, such as
the whether it is right to spend millions of dollars on
``high-tech'' medicine when many Americans lack basic medical care.
   ``I think the imbalance is horrible, but I don't think we should
deny high-tech medical advances,'' he said. The lack of health care
for some is ``a distribution problem,'' he added, comparing it to
the inability to get surplus food to all the hungry.

   Wind-whipped wildfires damaged at least 19
homes in Southern California on Monday as residents and
schoolchildren fled from flames that scorched more than 170 acres
of dry, brushy terrain.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Diamond Bar, a fast-moving brush
fire spread to a residential area and damaged four homes, said Los
Angeles County Fire Capt. Cliff Norton.
   Firefighters aided by helicopters contolled the blaze by 5 p.m.,
sheriff's Sgt. Sylvia Fort said.
   In Riverside, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, a grade school was
evacuated because of a fire in the dry Santa Ana River bottom
outside the city.
   At least 125 acres had burned and between 15 to 20 structures
incurred minor damage, said City Fire Capt. Richard Ballinger.
   ``It was quite a large column of smoke. We had a lot of people
panic-struck just from the look of it,'' Ballinger said.
   Four people, including a firefighter, suffered minor
smoke-inhalation and broken-bone injuries and were treated at local
hospitals, he said.
   The blaze began about 10:30 a.m. Monday and its cause wasn't
known. The 900 youngsters at Mountain View Elementary School were
evacuated.
   In Fontana, 50 miles east of Los Angeles, a small brushfire
destroyed one structure, leaving just a stone chimney, witnesses
said. It was controlled before doing further damage.
   Some 100 firefighters battled a fourth fire at the base of the
Cajon Pass near the Glen Helen regional park, where at least 50
acres were blackened, said Greg Cooper of the California Department
of Forestry. At one point, the blaze threatened the Treehouse Fun
Ranch nudist camp, but no evacuation was ordered, Cooper said. The
fire was also contained by 5 p.m.
   A ``red flag'' warning for extreme fire danger was issued
because of 50 mph winds and low humidity associated with fall's
first full-scale Santa Ana winds. The so-called devil winds
originate in the deserts to the east and north of the Los Angeles
basin, speeding up and heating by compression as they funnel
through mountain passes.

   Someone may have stolen information on
spotted owl nests in the Siskiyou National Forest and used it to
kill the young birds, the U.S. Forest Service says.
   A map and related documents that identify six nesting sites of
the threatened species near the Oregon Caves National Monument are
missing, said Rich Thurman, wildlife biologist for the Illinois
Valley Ranger District. Routine forays to the area in southwestern
Oregon by experts imitating owl calls failed to turn up any young,
he recently.
   The birds are at the center of a controversy that pits loggers
against environmentalists and government officials seeking to
preserve the virgin forests of the Pacific Northwest. The spotted
owl was declared a threatened species this year, a ruling that will
restrict logging in some areas.
   The documents may have been missing since June, the last time
they was used, Thurman said.
   Thurman said there was no direct evidence any owls were killed,
but he would have expected to find some young birds produced from
the nests.
   There was no evidence of a break-in at the Illinois Valley
Ranger District in Cave Junction, where the documents were kept in
files, he added. However, many people have the office key.
   Don Feuerborn, district law enforcement officer, said he was
almost certain the information was stolen.
   He said there was no evidence of any spotted owls being killed
in the district. But he noted the carcass of a barred owl was hung
on a Forest Service sign in the nearby Onion Mountain area a month
ago.

<TEXT>
   Australia's foreign minister agreed with U.S.
officials Monday that the military strike option must be kept open
in the Persian Gulf in case a peaceful settlement is not possible.
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, at a news conference following
U.S.-Australian security talks, echoed a similar statement by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III who said he told the
Australians ``we do not and cannot foreclose (on) the possible use
of force.''
   Baker, also at the news conference, added, ``We also, of course,
discussed in detail our preferred option of a peaceful, diplomatic,
political solution.''
   Evans said, ``We would infinitely prefer a peaceful settlement
through the application of sanctions and whatever needs to
accompany that ...'' and added, ``but equally we acknowledge that
the military strike option must be kept open in the event that
peaceful resolution fails.''
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke has sent two guided-missile
frigates, a supply ship and about 600 men to support U.S.
operations against Iraq's Aug. 1 takeover of Kuwait. The commitment
has the support of Australia's opposition party but has been
criticized by members of Australia's Arab community, small
political parties and other groups.
   A joint communique from the meeting which also included U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Australian Defense Minister
Robert Ray strongly condemned Iraq's invasion and occupation and
called for an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Baker said he was ``indeed very happy'' with Australia's support
in the crisis. He said there was no discussion of increasing the
commitment.
   The only points of differences noted in the talks were over
trade.
   Australian officials said they were concerned over several
provisions of the pending farm bill in the Congress. And U.S.
officials complained about Australian policies on government
procurements and the local content requirements for broadcast TV
commercials.

   Two American doctors won the Nobel
Prize in medicine Monday for their work in transplanting human
organs and bone marrow, revolutionary procedures that have saved
thousands of lives over three decades.
   Joseph E. Murray, 71, who performed the first successful organ
transplant - a kidney - and E. Donnall Thomas, 70, who pioneered
bone marrow transplants to cure leukemia, will share the $704,000
(4 million kronor) prize.
   Most Nobel Prizes in medicine have been awarded for basic
research, not for clinical treatment.
   ``I really thought this work was too clinical to ever win the
prize,'' Thomas said from his home in Bellevue, Wash. He is
affiliated with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, one of the world's major bone marrow transplant
institutions.
   But in the case of transplants, the clinical treatment was a
radical advance.
   ``This was astonishing, to take one organ and move it to another
person. It was science fiction 30 years ago,'' said Dr. Carl-Gustav
Groth, a member of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute,
which awarded the prize.
   Swedish dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel declared in his 1896 will
that the prizes should be given to those who have ``conferred the
greatest benefit on mankind.''
   The Nobel Assembly said Murray's and Thomas' discoveries had met
the requirement by saving tens of thousands of lives, providing
cures for such fatal diseases as leukemia, liver malignancy,
coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia.
   The doctors did their groundbreaking research separately during
the 1950s and 1960s, but they began their careers together at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where Murray remains
affilitated although he stopped performing surgery four years ago.
   ``He was a resident in medicine and I was a resident in
surgery,'' said Murray, who was in San Francisco on Monday for a
medical conference. ``This was after World War II.
   ``We both started working in transplants together, but from
different angles. It's marvelous to share it with him.''
   Murray, a native of Milford, Mass., mastered the problem of
organ rejection and in 1954 made the first successful organ
transplant, a kidney from one identical twin to another that
functioned for seven years. In earlier attempts, implanted organs
were rejected within hours or days.
   Thomas was also able to diminish the severe reaction that bone
marrow grafts can cause in recipients. He performed the first human
bone marrow transplant in 1956, and his procedure now is the
standard treatment for leukemia patients.
   It also is used to treat a variety of cancers and inherited
diseases, and researchers are investigating its potential use in
treating AIDS and other diseases.
   The Nobel Assembly said the idea of transplanting organs has
been discussed for thousands of years, and unsuccessful attempts
were made at the turn of the century. A medieval Italian painting
shows doctors trying to sew a black man's leg onto a white man's
body.
   Leading modern scientists, including 1960 Nobel medicine
laureate Sir Peter Medawar of Great Britain, had believed organ
transplant was biologically impossible.
   In the late 1940s, Medawar said a biological force existed that
``forever will inhibit transplantation from one individual to
another.''
   Groth said now even successful transplants from animals to
humans are not far away, but rejection by the immune system is
still the main problem.
   Murray's transplant work opened ``the field for other organs
such as liver, pancreas and heart,'' said the award statement.
   Up to 50,000 organ transplants are performed each year, 75
percent of them involving kidneys.
   Leukemia once was always fatal. Thomas' procedure now produces a
cure in 50 percent of all cases, and in 80 percent of childhood
cases. In 1987 about 4,000 patients received the treatment.
   ``Murray's and Thomas' discoveries are crucial for those tens of
thousands of severely ill patients who either can be cured, or be
given a decent life when other treatment methods are without
success,'' said the 50-member Nobel Assembly at Sweden's largest
and oldest medical university.
   Americans have won or shared 69 of the 142 Nobel medicine prizes
since 1901. Great Britain is second with 17 winners.
   Last year, the prize also went to Americans. J. Michael Bishop
and Harold E. Varmus won it for discovering a family of genes that
has helped scientists understand how cancer develops.
   The medicine or physiology prize is the first of five endowed by
Nobel to be awarded this month.
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Oct. 15 in Oslo, Norway.
Prizes for physics and chemistry discoveries will be announced Oct.
17 in Stockholm. The date for the literature prize has not been
announced.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, created by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1969, will be awarded in Stockholm on
Oct. 16.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

   Stores in Rwanda's capital reopened Monday
and people traveled freely around the city for the first time since
street battles began last week.
   A rebel leader denied his forces were involved in the clashes
that began in Kigali on Friday, blaming loyalist government
soldiers and others seeking to join the week-old rebellion.
   Military officials, however, claim to have arrested rebels in
the capital as hundreds of foreigners fled amid the fighting.
   Rebels calling themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front invaded
the tiny central African country from its northern neighbor Uganda
on Sept. 30. The force, mostly Rwandan refugees from the minority
Tutsi tribe, includes many deserters from Uganda's army.
   They reportedly were concentrated in Rwanda's northeastern
corner, although a diplomat said a group of rebels was sighted last
week at a lake 30 miles east of the capital.
   Nearly 100,000 Tutsi refugees have lived in Uganda since the
late 1950s and early 1960s after fleeing massacres by the majority
Hutu tribe.
   The rebels seek to oust President Juvenal Habyarimana, who they
accuse of corruption and abuse of power. A Hutu, Habyarimana has
ruled Rwanda since a 1973 coup.
   The refugees' repatriation had been hampered by severe
overcrowding in Rwanda, Africa's most densely populated country. An
average of more than 566 people live on every square mile, compared
with an average in the United States of 63 people per square mile.
   Since Friday, nearly 1,500 troos from France, Belgium and Zaire
have arrived to protect their citizens and embassies in Kigali and
help Rwanda's army maintain control.
   The rebels protested the intervention in news releases Monday
and warned foreign governments if their forces strayed from their
stated mission ``full responsibility for what happens to them shall
fall on your shoulders.''
   Although no government had ordered the evacuation of its
citizens, up to 1,000 foreigners, mostly dependants of aid workers,
left over the weekend on specially scheduled flights.
   The flow of foreign citizens leaving the former Belgian colony
slowed Monday as relative calm returned to Kigali. Residents
reported hearing light and sporadic shooting Sunday night, but said
the situation overall had quietened.
   The defense ministry announced that businesses were to resume
normal working hours Tuesday, but a dusk-to-dawn curfew continued
and public transportation remained suspended.
   Since the invasion, many Tutsi and some Hutu businessmen and
intellectuals in Kigali have been arrested, according to diplomats
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The diplomats could not
speculate on the number of arrests.
   A defense ministry statement Monday reported a ``good number''
of rebels and supporters had been arrested in the capital.
   ``The situation is more and more returning to normal, but some
areas are still infested with the assailants,'' it said.
   In an interview behind rebel lines with Uganda's state-owned
newspaper New Vision, a rebel identified as Maj. Peter Baingana
denied that rebels infiltrated the capital and claimed several
Rwandan soldiers had joined the insurgency, but did not say how
many.
   He claimed the rebels controlled the border post of Kagitumba,
55 miles north of Kigali, and said they had captured two armored
vehicles, four mortars, several machine guns and an anti-aircraft
gun during battles last week.
   The rebel force is led by Uganda's former deputy army commander,
Maj. Gen. Fred Rwigyema, a Rwandan of Tutsi origin. Estimates of
the rebel troop strength range from several hundred to several
thousand.

   In Jerusalem's worst bloodshed since 1967,
police fired Monday on stone-throwing Palestinians at the Temple
Mount sacred to both Jews and Moslems, and at least 19 Arabs died.
   The shooting began after about 3,000 Palestinians hurled a
barrage of stones from the mount onto Jews gathered just below at
the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, where up to 20,000 Jews were
celebrating the festival of Sukkot. The wall is Judaism's holiest
site.
   The Arabs were apparently infuriated by rumors that Jewish
extremists planned to march onto the Temple Mount, which is under
Moslem control.
   Police fired tear gas, then rubber bullets and live ammunition.
Helicopters flew overhead.
   The bloodbath touched off riots in the occupied territories that
killed three more Palestinians. A Jewish cab driver also was found
shot to death.
   Police Minister Roni Milo said 19 Arabs were killed in Jerusalem
and about 140 wounded. Arab hospital officials at first said 22
were killed, then lowered their count to 18, with 125 wounded -
lower than that given by the Israelis.
   Milo said 120 Palestinians were arrested.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed regret but insisted
Israeli forces were blameless.
   ``We are greatly sorry about the blood spilled in vain,'' he
said.
   The single-day death toll was the highest since the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation began in December 1987, and the
most deaths by violence in Jerusalem since Israeli soldiers
captured the holy city's Arab sector in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Arab reports said two Palestinians were killed and 62 wounded in
later rioting in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   A 20-year-old Palestinian was shot to death in the occupied West
Bank when he tried to grab a soldier's rifle, Arab and Israeli
reports said.
   Late Monday, the body of a Jewish driver, shot in the head, was
discovered in his taxi near the Israeli Arab village of Abu Ghosh
outside Jerusalem. The national Itim news agency said police
suspected it was a Palestinian nationalist killing but were
checking other motives.
   Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip demanded
U.N. protection and announced a weeklong protest strike starting
Tuesday.
   Army radio reported a mass Israeli troop movement into the
territories. Military officials said the entire Gaza Strip, home to
700,000 Palestinians, would be put under curfew. Widespread curfews
already were in place in the West Bank.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in Washington
that Israel needs to ``exercise restraint'' in handling such
disturbances.
   The U.N. Security Council, asked to condemn the killings, met in
New York. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed
``grave concern'' over the incident and said Israeli authorities
may have used excessive force.
   Iraq's governing Arab Baath Socialist Party threatened
retaliation and predicted the ``crime'' would lead Arabs to ``the
liberation of Jerusalem and all other holy places'' - a reference
to Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia.
   American photographer Mel Rosen watched from a balcony about 300
yards away, and said the Palestinians let fly such a torrent of
rocks he first thought flocks of birds had left their nests in the
crannies of the Wailing Wall.
   Oded Wiener, an Israeli witness, said thousands of Jews fled in
panic.
   ``People started shouting `Where is my child?' and running,'' he
said. ``Suddenly I saw this huge, empty plaza. It looked like after
a pogrom.''
   Atop the Temple Mount, Moslem cleric Sheik Jamal Alami pointed
to pools of blood and told an American reporter: ``Your country is
giving the Israelis bullets. In 1967, there was no shooting like
today. This is a holy mosque, and you tell me, why are the soldiers
here?''
   A 14-year-old Palestinian boy who gave his name only as Safyan
said he and other Moslems ran to protect the holy site after mosque
loudspeakers warned that Jews were coming.
   On Israel army radio, Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner said the
bloodshed was ``very sad,'' but he insisted Arabs started the
violence.
   He said authorities repeatedly assured Moslem leaders no Jewish
march would be permitted on the mount. A small group of marchers
were shunted elsewhere and did not figure in the riots. As rioting
eased, about 50 of the Jewish zealots arrived carrying Israeli
flags and shouting ``Kill the Arabs!'' officials said.
   Terner said authorities later found caches of stones and
flammable material, proving the Arabs had mounted ``a planned
provocation.''
   He said their aim was partly to divert world attention from the
Persian Gulf crisis, in which Palestinians have supported Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
   Shamir claimed in a speech Monday in northern Israel that at
Temple Mount, ``somebody tried to exploit the atmosphere of
hysteria and fundamentalist radicalism transmitted from Baghdad and
ignite an alien fire in Jerusalem.''
   Terner said five or six police were hurt by stones. Itim said 22
civilians, most of them worshipers at the wall, also suffered minor
injuries.
   Scenes of anguish took place outside hospitals as victims poured
in and relatives hunted for loved ones.
   Jews revere the Wailing Wall as the last remnant of the ancient
temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70. Moslems believe the
Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven from the Mount, site of the
Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques.
   Khaled Shalatef, a 26-year-old Palestinian hit in the head with
rubber bullets, said at Augusta Victoria Hospital: ``We are Moslems
and we came to defend our mosque.
   ``I did not expect Jews to perform such terrible massacres
against unarmed people.''
   Terner said rioters burned the police station.
   ``There was no policeman who wasn't stoned,'' Terner said.
``Their lives were in real danger. They had no other way but to
respond the way they did. The toll was very heavy, but the Israel
police had to defend themselves, and to protect the thousands of
worshipers.''
   Monday's deaths raised the toll in the uprising to 758
Palestinians killed by troops or Israeli civilians. At least 278
other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs for allegedly
collaborating with Israel. Forty-eight Israelis have died in the
violence.
   Among those arrested Monday was Faisal Husseini, a leading
supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization who is involved
in unofficial peace contacts with Israeli moderates.

   Two American airmen who volunteered for duty with the
multinational force facing Iraq died in a jet crash Monday in Saudi
Arabia, and the Navy searched for two helicopters and eight crew
members missing in the Arabian Sea.
   The Pentagon said search and rescue crews had spotted the
wreckage of at least one helicopter late Monday but no bodies had
been found.
   International forces in the Persian Gulf crisis showed a new
measure of teamwork when U.S., British and Australian warships
upholding the U.N. trade embargo forced two Iraqi ships to stop and
submit to searched.
   In one case, the Western ships fired shots. The other ship was
diverted to a port after food and other prohibited cargo was
discovered.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus,
said the actions amounted to harassment by ``sea pirates.''
   U.S. military officials said a RF4C Phantom reconnaisance jet
crashed in the southern Saudi Arabian peninsula.
   The jet belonged to a unit of the Alabama Air National Guard on
a training mission, said guard spokeswoman Toni Long.
   Ms. Long identified the victims as Maj. Barry K. Henderson, 40,
a senior pilot from Tuscumbia, Ala., and Maj. Stephen G. Schramm,
43, a master navigator from Birmingham, Ala.
   Both were assigned to the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron
of the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and had volunteered for
duty in Saudi Arabia, said Ms. Long. Their unit had not been
activated.
   A military spokesman, Navy Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle, said the crash
was under investigation and that he could provide no other details.
   The two Marine helicopters disappeared about dawn during a
training flight over the north Arabian Sea, east of the Persian
Gulf, said Van Sickle.
   Naval officers ruled out hostile action and said there was no
indication that the helicopters might have collided.
   Pentagon officials in Washington said the Marines were from Camp
Pendleton, Calif.
   The helicopters were operating from the carrier USS Okinawa, one
of more than 12 ships deployed in the region after Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Before Monday, five American service members had been killed in
the region since the deployment began. In addition, 13 crew members
died Aug. 29 when a giant transport aircraft loaded with supplies
for U.S. forces in the gulf crashed and burned shortly after
takeoff in West Germany.
   The United States leads a multinational force of ships in the
region and troops in Saudi Arabia, and the United Nations has
imposed a land, sea and air embargo to isolate Iraq and try to
force it to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The warning shots fired at the Iraqi freighter Al-Wasitti marked
the first time a British warship has shot to enforce the embargo.
   The British Defense Ministry said the Iraqi freighter had been
shadowed by the HMS Battleaxe, the USS Reasoner and the HMAS
Adelaide during the night, then called to stop for inspection.
   But the Al-Wasitti ignored repeated appeals and at daybreak, the
three vessels fired warning shots across the bow of the freighter,
the ministry said in London.
   It said Royal Marines boarded the 5,885-ton vessel, with a Coast
Guard team from the Reasoner following them. It was empty and was
allowed to continue on its way, presumably to Iraq, British defense
officials said.
   The second Iraqi ship, the Tadmur, was ordered to an undisclosed
port after boarding teams found rice, flour ``and other prohibited
cargo in substantial quantities,'' said a statement from the U.S.
military command in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
   The tanker was first boarded by Royal Marines from the frigate
HMS Brazen, followed by teams from the USS Goldsborough and the
Australian frigate HMAS Darwin.
   Authorities did not disclose where the the Tadmur was sent, but
the closest Omani ports would be Muscat and Ras-al-Hadd. No shots
were fired in that incident.
   The Tadmur, which officials said was bound for Basra, Iraq, was
stopped in the Red Sea on Sept. 27 after a U.S. warship fired
across its bow. After a boarding party found it empty, it was
allowed to proceed.
   U.S. warships had been playing a dominant role in enforcing the
U.N.-ordered naval blockade to pressure Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein into ending the 2-month-old occupation of Kuwait. But in
recent weeks, British, Canadian, Australian and Spanish warships
have joined in the interceptions.
   ``In our maritime intercept operations, it is truly a
multinational effort in support of U.N. Resolutions 661 and 665,''
said Vice Adm. Henry H. Mauz, commander of U.S. naval forces in the
region.
   He said that as of Monday, 2,061 ships had been intercepted
since the embargo began Aug. 12.
   Of those ships, 207 were searched - 37 the past four days, he
said. In only a handful of cases have warning shots been fired, the
first by U.S. warships inside the Persian Gulf on Aug. 18.
   In other developments:
   -A Kuwaiti official said his nation's government-in-exile will
ask the United Nations to allow an airlift of medicine into Kuwait
City to help people who are critically ill. ``We are very concerned
about people who are dying because of a lack of medical supplies,''
Suleman Mutawaa, the government's planning minister, said in
London.
   -Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu completed a five-nation
Middle East tour with a visit to Oman and repeated his country's
position that Iraqi must pull out of Kuwait.
   -Extra production by OPEC members in September made up for
three-quarters of the 4 million-barrel-a-day loss caused by the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis, the Middle East Economic Survey reported. But
the respected newsletter said the world still faces a shortfall in
the fourth quarter of this year.
   -The German government plans to remove its remaining staff
members, about five, from its embassy in Kuait in the next few
days because the mission has run out of supplies, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman. Iraqi troops have surrounded embassies that
remain open and have cut off power and water.

   A baby born with usually fatal cardiac
defects survived after his heart improved unexpectedly, but his
parents on Monday begged for donor hearts to save the lives of
other dying infants.
   ``We've been awed by the baby, really,'' said Dr. Leonard
Bailey, a pioneering heart surgeon at Loma Linda University Medical
Center. ``It's been an impressive experience. ... It's sort of a
miracle.''
   Weston Kilpatrick, born in Santa Maria on July 27, is alive only
because of ``our prayers and the prayers of others and perhaps some
medical phenomenon,'' his father, pharmacist Layne Kilpatrick, said
during a Monday news conference at the university.
   ``I think this child has an incredible will to live. It's
miraculous,'' Kilpatrick said of his son's spontaneous recovery
from three of five heart defects. ``It hasn't been seen before.''
   Surgery was performed Friday to correct two other defects, but
Weston no longer requires a heart transplant to save his life,
Bailey said.
   ``It's like a ton of bricks being relieved from you,'' said
dietician Janet Kilpatrick, the infant's mother.
   The Kilpatricks said other newborns with deadly congenital heart
defects will die unless parents of babies killed in car wrecks or
other accidents agree to donate their dead children's hearts.
   About 100 babies in the United States die each day because the
demand for newborn heart donors far outstrips the supply, said
Bailey, who transplanted a baboon's heart into a girl known as Baby
Fae in 1984 in a futile and harshly criticized attempt to save that
newborn's life.
   Since the Baby Fae transplant, Loma Linda has become a leading
center for using heart transplants to save babies born with fatal
cardiac defects. Of 73 infants who have received transplanted
hearts there, 55 are still alive.
   Bailey said about 20 hospitals across the nation now perform
infant heart transplants, but the wait for donor hearts has
increased from three weeks to five weeks as demand for the surgery
grew.
   ``It's such a terrible waste that these children and these
babies have to die when these gentlemen (doctors) have proven they
can save their lives'' with infant-to-infant transplants, Layne
Kilpatrick said.
   Baby Fae was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a fatal
underdevelopment of the heart's left pumping chamber. Weston
Kilpatrick was born with a similar but less severe defect, along
with underdeveloped mitral and aortic heart valves, a narrowed
aorta and an open duct between two arteries, Bailey said.
   The mitral valve regulates blood flow from the upper chamber to
the lower chamber of the left side of the heart. The aortic valve
controls blood flow from the left side of the heart into the aorta,
the main artery carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the
body.
   After being transferred to Loma Linda, Weston remained for weeks
on a waiting list for donor hearts. When doctors performed
ultrasound tests on his heart about 10 days ago, they were amazed
to find spontaneous and unprecedented development of the left side
of the heart and the two aalves.
   ``We have never seen this phenomenon,'' said Dr. Jorge
McCormack, a pediatric cardiologist.
   Bailey said Weston's heart has ``developed to a nearly normal
architecture. ... It's a fascinating thing.''
   Weston's abnormally narrowed aorta - the main artery that
carries blood from the heart to the body - was repaired Friday by
Dr. Steven Gundry.
   The operation also closed the open duct between two key coronary
arteries. The duct normally closes by itself after birth.
   Weston should be able to go home ``in another week or so,''
Bailey said.
   Mrs. Kilpatrick said her first priority is to hold the child she
once thought would die without a transplant.
   Despite Weston's improvement, Bailey said, ``99 percent or more
of the babies (with such defects) are going to require a transplant
if they're going to live.''

   An appeals court refused Monday to overturn
an injunction that sent striking Temple University professors back
to their classrooms without a contract last week.
   Commonwealth Judge Doris Smith said that to reverse the lower
court's order and allow the 29-day strike to resume would cause
``substantial harm.''
   The ruling upheld an injunction issued Wednesday by Common Pleas
Judge Samuel Lehrer against the Temple Association of University
Professionals, the union representing 1,100 teachers, librarians
and other academic staff.
   The union advised its members in a taped message that he
injunction was upheld, but said ``the TAUP appeal will continue to
go forward.''
   The union scheduled a silent vigil on campus Tuesday afternoon
before a meeting of private university's board of trustees.
   Meanwhile, the university has extended the fall semester from
Dec. 12 through Jan. 15, thus canceling most vacation time.
   The extension angered both students and faculty. Students won't
be able to work or travel during the Christmas and New Year
holidays teachers claim the semester cannot be extended without
negotiations.
   Lehrer ordered last week that negotiations resume, but none are
scheduled.
   In winning the injunction, Temple had argued that the strike
``created a clear and present danger or threat to the health,
safety or welfare of the public.''
   Smith found that Lehrer was correct in ruling that the strike
posed a danger to the public - 29,000 students - if it continued.
   Smith rejected the union's argument that its members would
suffer irreparable harm if they were not allowed to continue their
strike until a new contract is negotiated. The old contract expired
June 30.
   Professors returned to their classrooms Wednesday after the
longest strike in the university's history.
   Union members want 7 percent pay raises and do not want to pay
for health care. The universiy offered a 5 percent salary hike in

<HEAD>Colombia Offers Concessions to Drug Dealers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Cesar Gaviria offered major
concessions to drug traffickers on Monday, including no
extradition, reduced sentences and staying free while awaiting
trial in Colombia.
   The property of those who surrender will not be confiscated.
Traffickers have vast holdings in Colombia.
   It was the clearest message yet that the government does not
want to resume a war against traffickers that began nearly 14
months ago and led to more than 500 people being killed.
   But the Medellin drug cartel, which has been blamed for the
deaths of hundreds the last year to try to force Colombian leaders
to end extradition, said in communiques in the last month it now
wants full pardons.
   Gaviria decreed that drug suspects who surrender will not face
extraditon, and that their sentences would be halved if they
confess and help police nab other suspects.
   It is doubtful the decree will do much toward dismantling the
powerful drug cartels that sell billions of dollars of cocaine
worldwide, providing U.S. users with most of their supply.
   The president's plan appeared flawed in its assumption that
traffickers would surrender.
   Drug dealers who helped authorities arrest others could not
expect to live long in Colombia's prisons, where murder for hire is
routine.
   In the past, traffickers threatened or bribed judges into
dropping charges.
   Even if a case is not dropped, it could drag on for years under
Colombia's muddled court system.
   The maximum sentence is 20 years. There is no death penalty.
   Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel announced the decree at a
news conference. It was issued under a state of siege that lets the
president bypass congress.
   The decree is not limited to drug traffickers, but is clearly
aimed at them.
   Giraldo said that if a trafficking suspect surrenders but does
not confess, he would lose the right to a reduced sentence, but
would not be extradited.
   If the suspect does not surrender, extradition would still be
possible.
   A national police communique said Monday that trafficking
suspect Joaquin Gallo was extradited last Saturday to the United
States, the 25th Colombian to be sent there for trial on
drug-related charges since the crackdown began.
   The communique have no particulars.
   Seven journalists, including Diana Turbay, daughter of former
President Julio Cesar Turbay, were kidnapped by the cartel since
September, apparently to be held as hostages until the cartel gets
what it wants.
   Gaviria has said he will not negotiate with traffickers.
   The cartel wants traffickers treated the same as leftist
guerrillas who negotiate with the government. Guerrillas who
surrender get pardons.

   A man being arrested Monday in the Lenoir
County Courthouse pulled a gun from his coat and wounded a deputy
and an assistant district attorney before shooting himself,
authorities said.
   ``He started putting up a fuss and didn't want to be arrested,''
said James W. Copeland Jr., the assistant district attorney who was
shot in the hip about 11:20 a.m. ``The next thing I knew there was
a bam.''
   Capt. Lester P. Gosnell was wounded in the leg by the same shot
from the .22-caliber pistol. As officers wrestled the gunman on the
floor in a waiting area at the back of a courtroom, another shot
hit the man in the chest.
   John Linwood Sutton, 24, of LaGrange was in critical condition
at Pitt County Memorial Hospital in Greenville late Monday, a
hospital spokesman said. Gosnell and Copeland were treated at
Lenoir County Memorial Hospital for flesh wounds and released.
   Police Capt. R.G. Brown said Sutton was in Lenoir County
Superior Court to answer charges of possession of stolen goods. No
shots were fired by law officers, Brown said.
   Brown quoted Sutton as saying ``he was not going back to prison
for anyone.''

<HEAD>Soviets Deny Making Offer on Kurils, Call Report `Disinformation'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday denied offering Japan
concessions over the Kuril Islands, and its news agency described
the Japanese reports as ``disinformation'' aimed at setting back a
rapprochment.
   Japanese newspapers and the Kyodo News Service reported Sunday
that Soviet officials had offered to return two disputed islands to
Japan and sign a new peace treaty within five years, officially
ending Soviet-Japanese hostilities dating from World War II.
   They quoted Japanese sources as saying the offer was made to
Japanese lawmakers last month in Moscow.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu cautiously welcomed the reported offer Monday, with
Kaifu saying he would consider such a proposal if it were made
through formal channels.
   But later Monday in Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a
statement denying it made any such offer. It said the Japanese
lawmakers visiting Moscow ``were handed no draft documents, let
alone documents that would raise in any form the question of the
Kuril Islands, which belong to the Soviet Union,'' according to the
official news agency Tass.
   Tass later carried an analysis ridiculing the Kyodo report as
``sensational.''
   ``This is one more piece of `disinformation,' not the first and
possibly not the last,'' wrote political analyst Yuri Tyssovsky.
   ``It is apparently beneficial for certain Japanese circles to
paint the Kurils in Japanese national colors on geographical maps
to keep the problem as an irritant in Soviet-Japanese relations.''
   The Tass anaylsis said a peace treaty must be signed first. ``It
would then be possible to return to the `Northern Territorites'
problem without unnecessary prejudice or old stereotypes.''
   Japan, however, insists the Soviet Union acknowledge Japanese
ownership of the islands before it will conclude any treaty with
Moscow.
   The exchange comes as both sides have been signalling a desire
to resolve their 45-year-old dispute, focused on three islands and
a cluster of islets off northern Japan totaling 2,000 square miles.
The Soviet Union claims them as historically Russian territory,
while Tokyo insists they were ceded to Japan in 19th-century
treaties.

<TEXT>
   About 500 soldiers broke camp Monday following a
nearly two-month deployment to help authorities control a violent
land dispute by the Mohawks Indians.
   About 600 Royal Canadian Regiment troops will remain near the
Kahnawake Mohawk reserve south of Montreal until late October, when
Mohawks and Quebec provincial police are expected to reach an
accord over police jurisdiction.
   The troops that left Monday were scheduled to return to Camp
Gagetown near Fredericton, New Brunswick.
   The unrest began in July when Mohawks erected a road barricade
in Oka to protest plans to expand a golf course and condominium
development onto land claimed as ancestral territory by the
Indians. A police officer died in a July 11 shooting incident.
   Mohawks at Kahnawake later blocked a bridge and two highways
running through their reserve, a route used by many Montreal-bound
commuters.
   Soldiers were dispatched to the area in mid-August.
   The barricades were removed following negotiations with
authorities. The last armed Mohawks at Oka surrendered two weeks
ago.

   An elementary school principal
agreed Monday to burn a telephone booth-sized box in which he had
planned to hold disruptive students. Parents complained the box
amounted to child abuse.
   The 2-by-4-by-8-foot plywood ``detention box'' arrived at Galena
Elementary School Thursday and was never used.
   It contained a bench and a one-way window so that the child's
behavior could be monitored but the student could not see out.
   Principal Russell Hochstetler agreed to burn the box after he
was confronted by about 40 parents during a meeting at the school
in this small town in northwest Indiana.
   ``If some of you men want to help me, we'll throw it in the back
of my truck and I'll take it home and burn it tonight,''
Hochstetler said.
   Several parents promptly rose and helped remove the box from a
hallway near the principal's office.
   Many parents said they were angry they were not told about the
box before it was ordered.
   ``I can't see this happening,'' said Betty Nowicki, parent of a
Galena student. ``To me, it's a form of child abuse.''

<HEAD>Wyche Fined for Barring Woman Reporter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Football League on Oct. 5 handed
Cincinnati coach Sam Wyche the largest fine ever for an NFL coach,
for excluding a woman reporter from the Bengals' locker room.
   The league refused to disclose the amount of the fine,
describing it only as one-seventeenth of Wyche's annual pay.
Reports have placed Wyche's pay at $500,000, which would put the
fine at just under $30,000.
   Wyche had no comment, Cincinnati spokesman Al Heim said. There
is no appeal process available to the coach.
   The fine was announced by Joe Browne, the NFL's vice president
for communications, who said, ``The commissioner said last year
that equal media access was a priority and I believe this
emphasizes that point.''
   Tagliabue had promised a heavy fine after Wyche refused to allow
Denise Tom, a reporter for USA Today, to enter the Bengals' locker
room following a game against Seattle.
   ``I will not allow a woman to walk into a room of 50 naked
men,'' Wyche said. Instead, he delivered quarterback Boomer Esiason
to Tom for an interview outside the locker room.
   At midweek, Wyche offered a solution to the access problem that
he called ``Plan B,'' saying all media would be allowed in the
dressing room for 20 minutes after games while the players remained
in their uniforms. Then the room would be cleared and media not
allowed back in until the players had showered and dressed.
Tagliabue rejected that idea.
   Gene Policinski, managing editor for sports at USA Today, said,
``The quick action by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and the
warning that any future violations will mean even more severe
discipline supports the basic idea that reporters, male and female,
have a legitimate professional role in NFL locker rooms.''
   A year ago, Tagliabue fined Wyche $3,000 for closing the
Bengals' locker room to all media following a loss to Seattle. And
in 1986, then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle fined him $2,000 for
knocking a microphone out of a reporter's hand in the dressing
room.
   The largest previous fine for an NFL coach was $5,000, levied
against several coaches for public criticism of officials and for
on-field conduct.

   Harvard law professor Philip Heymann was appointed Oct. 1 by NFL

exposed himself and made lewd comments Sept. 17 and that two or
three other players she couldn't identify stood naked near her. At

<HEAD>Coach `Push-Kicks' Free-Lance Photographer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houston Oilers assistant coach and a free-lance
news photographer differed over whether the newsman was kicked in
the ribs or ``push-kicked'' during a game with San Diego on Sept.
30.
   Photographer Chris Corr said assistant coach Bob Young first
tripped over him while backing away from an out-of-bounds play.
Corr, who was shooting a picture of the Oilers' bench, said Young
jumped to his feet and kicked him.
   Young said Corr had crossed over into a team area where he did
not belong and that his action came in the heat of the game.
   ``He was where he wasn't supposed to be and I push-kicked him,''
Young said. ``I apologized twice and he said he understood. I think
you guys (media) are making more of it than it should be.''
   Corr said he was well outside of the off-limits area. Oilers
coach Jack Pardee called it an unfortunate incident.
   ``The photographer was in our area and Bob backed over him,''
Pardee said. ``Bob's back has been bothering him since he hurt it
in training camp. He pushed the guy with his foot out of
frustration.''

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation Rejects $540 Million Stock Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Foundation has rejected a $540
million bid from Gannett Co. Inc. to buy its 10 percent block of
the media giant's stock.
   Martin F. Birmingham, chairman of the foundation's finance and
investment committee, said Oct. 1 that the foundation, Gannett's
largest shareholder, had authorized the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers to seek other offers.
   ``The current depressed market price of Gannett stock does not
represent the true value of the company,'' Birmingham said. ``It
would be irresponsible for the trustees to accept this
unsatisfactory `at the market' bid.''
   The bid, dated Sept. 14, was $33.87{ per share for a total value
of about $540 million.
   The foundation had told the company that no substantive talks
with interested third parties would take place as long as serious
negotiations were going on with the company.
   Douglas H. McCorkindale, Gannett Co. Inc.'s chief financial
officer, agreed the company's stock was undervalued because of the
recent downturn in advertising revenue.
   Despite the foundation's rejection, Gannett Co. was still ``a
ready, willing and able buyer of the stock,'' he said.
   McCorkindale said Gannett was not worried that having such a
large block of stock up for grabs could make the company a
potential takeover target because ``financing a takeover in today's
market is much, much more difficult than it was two, three or four
years ago.''
   He cited the decline of the junk bond market, which financed a
number of takeovers in the 1980s.
   He also noted that Gannett has a shareholder rights offering
plan that would kick in after somebody acquires 15 percent of the
stock. The plan would make it prohibitively expensive for a suitor
to acquire more shares, McCorkindale said.
   John Morton, a newspaper analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan in
Washington, agreed that Gannett was the most likely buyer to pay a
premium over market price.
   ``If they (the foundation) couldn't get the price they wanted
from Gannett, I think it's unlikely they're going to get it from
anybody else,'' said Morton.
   ``It's not as though Gannett is a company that's considered a
prime candidate for a takeover. Takeover-prone companies normally
are those that have not satisfied their shareholders with financial
performance over the years. You cannot say that about Gannett,'' he
said.
   Birmingham said the market value of the stock was about $800
million at the third-quarter high a year earlier.
   ``Since last year, many factors have contributed to the decline
of Gannett stock, including the company's first down quarter since
it went public in 1967 and its gloomy predictions about 1990
earnings overall,'' he said.
   The foundation was established in 1935 as an independent entity
with controlling ownership of the company.

<HEAD>New Haven Register Cuts Staff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Haven Register, in a
cost-cutting move it blamed on sagging advertising revenues, laid
off 19 employees Oct. 3 and said it was taking other steps to
improve its finances.
   Thomas P. Geyer, the Register's chief executive officer, said
top executives of the company also have cut their salaries by 10
percent to 20 percent to trim expenses. The newspaper also has
raised advertising and home-delivery rates.
   The layoffs include 11 editorial employees, four in the business
office and four in advertising. Nine vacant jobs will remain
unfilled. The newspaper has 780 full-and part-time employees.
   ``When we made our budget plans last spring, we had counted on
the decline in the local economy leveling off by fall,'' Geyer
said. ``But advertising linage continues to go down, especially in
real estate advertising, help wanted and retail and merchandise
advertising.''
   Ad linage is down about 20 percent from last year. The company
also saw a decline in 1989, Geyer said.
   The newspaper laid off 12 workers in the circulation department
in December, one in the composing room this summer, and offered an
early retirement program in June, Geyer said.
   The Register was acquired last July by the New York investment
firm E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., which previously shared ownership
with Ralph Ingersoll II.
   The newspaper has changed ownership three times since the
Jackson family, its longtime owners, sold it in 1986 to Goodson
Newspapers. Goodson sold it to Ingersoll for $250 million.

we can give people things that the physical limitations of the
newspaper prohibit us from giving them,'' said News Editor Jay
Ambrose.
   Dennis Dressman, managing editor-administration, said the
electronic newspaper will offer ``dazzling graphics'' and some news

<HEAD>Consultant Says Bid To Buy Gray Communications Too Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The future ownership of The Albany Herald and
its parent company remained uncertain Oct. 2 after a consultant's
report said an offer from Editor James H. ``Jimmy'' Gray was too
low.
   The estate of Gray's deceased father, James H. Gray Sr., owns
51.7 percent of the parent company. The younger Gray had an
agreement to buy out his brother and sister, but the consultant's
report has, at the least, postponed that deal.
   It also reopened the possibility that someone outside the family
could buy the company, though Jimmy Gray has said he believes the
will requires the stock be sold to one of the three heirs at a fair
price.
   Besides the newspaper, Gray Communications Inc. owns three
television stations, a real estate firm, a distribution firm and an
aircraft-servicing facility.
   The senior Gray, Albany's mayor, died in September 1986. The
will divides his shares among Jimmy Gray, Geoffrey Gray and
Constance G. Greene, who are also co-publishers of the newspaper.
   Mrs. Greene and Geoffrey Gray first wanted to have the stock
sold and the proceeds distributed among the heirs. Later they
agreed to sell to their brother for $162.50 per share, if a
committee of the board determined that the offer was fair. The
committee found that the offer was not adequate.
   The deadline for taking action on the proposal was Oct. 1. Board
member Neal Ray, who also serves as the company's attorney, said
the failure to conclude an agreement by the deadline meant that the
estate could seek an outside buyer for the stock.

<HEAD>Roseanne Barr, Husband File $35 Million Racketeering Suit Against
Tabloids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Roseanne Barr and her husband have
filed a $35 million federal racketeering lawsuit against the
National Enquirer and Star tabloids over their publication of her
love letters.
   The suit was filed Oct. 2 under federal racketeering statutes
charging copyright infringement, conspiracy, invasion of property
and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
   The suit seeks $10 million compensatory damages and $25 million
punitive damages from the National Enquirer, Star and the
publications' owner, News America Publishing Inc.
   Miss Barr and husband Tom Arnold are seeking relief under the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known
as RICO.
   The racketeering activity, according to the suit, involves the
Enquirer's alleged ``participation in a scheme to obtain the
private papers and effects of celebrities by inducing and paying
persons and entities to steal such information and transport it in
interstate commerce.''
   The couple also seeks the return of Miss Barr's ``private,
written letters and outpourings of love and affection to Arnold
embodied in four writings ... purloined and-or published by
defendants.''
   National Enquirer Editor Iain Calder said from his Lantana,
Fla., office that he hadn't seen the suit and so couldn't respond
to specific allegations.
   ``Any legal action against this publication under RICO is so
ridiculous that it is clear this is just another pathetic publicity
stunt by Roseanne,'' Calder said.
   ``She is trashing the National Enquirer, but we are in good
company. A few weeks ago she was trashing the national anthem.''
   Star Editor Dick Kaplan said from Tarrytown, N.Y., that he would
have no comment because he hadn't seen the suit.
   The suit said the tabloids operate ``a vast network of
underground operatives and includes, but is not limited to, agents,
employees, friends, relatives and associates of celebrities as well
as persons and entities who provide goods and services to
celebrities, including plaintiffs.''

   Aden promised a retraction and said he would do everything he
could to help out Exposito, but that did not include an offer to
make up for his lost income.
   Exposito's boss at M&amp;M Floor Co., Bert Butler, has tried to help
by giving him a lesser job at half the pay until his previous
position reopens. Butler already had hired someone else to replace
his employee of eight years.
   The Informer correctly printed that Exposito was arrested last
month for driving with a suspended driver's license. It also
printed that he was arrested on a cocaine charge, which jail
records show is inaccurate.
   Butler saw the drug arrest item Sept. 28 and fired Exposito the
next day.
   Aden said he is still trying to determine how the mistake was
made and is trying to find another job for Exposito.

<HEAD>Newspaper Plans To Appeal Libel Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who disputed a Charleston
Gazette editorial about his handling of a workers' compensation
case won a $375,000 libel judgment against the newspaper Oct. 4.
   The Gazette said it would appeal.
   Raymond A. Hinerman claimed the May 20, 1983, editorial damaged
his reputation, associated him with dishonest attorneys, and held
him up to ridicule among his peers.
   His lawsuit said portions of the editorial were false and were
``published with the intent to injure the plaintiff.''
   The Brooke County Circuit Court jury awarded Hinerman $300,000
in punitive damages and $75,000 in compensatory damages.
   The newspaper said the editorial was based on reliable wire
service and newspaper reports of a state Supreme Court appeal. The
case concerned a default judgment of $12,000 that Hinerman won
against a coal miner who had refused to pay him for legal services.
   The newspaper's lawyer, Rudolph L. DiTrapano, argued that the
editorial did not contain errors cited by Hinerman, and said he was
confident the decision would be overturned on appeal.

<HEAD>Court Permits Libel Suit in Comparative Ads Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused to kill a libel
lawsuit stemming from advertisements comparing Blue Cross and Blue
Shield services to those of a health industry competitor.
   The court on Oct. 1 left intact a ruling that could send U.S.
Healthcare's libel allegations against Blue Cross and Blue Shield
to a federal jury in Philadelphia.
   At issue was whether some libel cases involving commercial
speech could be held to less stringent standards than others.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in reviving Healthcare's
suit last March, relaxed the rules for commercial-speech libel
cases.
   Since 1964, public figures - including most businesses - suing
for libel must prove that the sued-over statements are false and
were made with ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless disregard
of falsity.
   Private citizens suing for libel face a far less demanding
burden: Having to prove that the statements are false and were made
negligently.
   In ruling on Healthcare's lawsuit, the 3rd Circuit court said
the more stringent ``actual malice'' standard need not be used when
the allegedly libelous statements were advertisements.
   The appeals court overturned a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Marvin Katz, who had dismissed the suit.

<HEAD>Court To Consider Reinstating Libel Suit Against New Yorker Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Oct. 1 to consider
reinstating a libel lawsuit against Janet Malcolm, a staff writer
for The New Yorker magazine, by a psychologist who says she made up
quotes attributed to him.
   The justices said they will review a federal appeals court
ruling that threw out Jeffrey Masson's suit last year.
   The appeals court ruling was criticized by some who said it
recognized ``the right to fake quotes.''
   Specifically, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
public figures who sue for libel over allegedly altered quotes must
show that the quotes are not even ``rational interpretations'' of
what was said.
   Private citizens who sue for libel must prove only that the
sued-over statements are false and were made negligently. But
public figures who sue for libel must prove the statements are
false and were made with ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless
disregard of falsity.
   In dismissing Masson's suit, the 9th Circuit court said,
``Malice will not be inferred from evidence showing that the quoted
language does not contain the exact words used ... provided that
the fabricated quotations are either rational interpretations of
ambiguous remarks made by the public figure ... or do not alter the
substantive content of unambiguous remarks actually made by the
public figure.''
   The appeals court did not rule on whether Ms. Malcolm actually
fabricated quotes attributed to Masson.

<TEXT>
   An anti-Semitic quote in an independent
Dartmouth College paper known for its strong criticisms of
minorities has infuriated people on and off campus.
   Trustees and staffers of The Dartmouth Review insist a saboteur
placed the Adolf Hitler quote in the publication, and they have
apologized. They further claimed that university President James
Freedman and others have created ``a lynch-mob'' mentality on
campus.
   About 2,000 people attended a rally Oct. 4 to denounce the quote
and the paper. History professor Bruce Nelson told the crowd the
Review ``lacks a shred of intellectual integrity.''
   Staffers and trustees at the Review say they've suffered
unjustly for an act by someone determined to discredit the paper.
   The Review, published since 1980, has been vilified through the
years for its views on women, homosexuals, blacks and Indians.
   The latest controversy concerns the edition distributed Sept.
29, on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. The quotation, from
Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' was inserted unattributed into the
statement of principles on the Review's masthead:
   ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the sense of
the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am fighting for
the Lord's work.''

   Two of seven journalists held hostage by
the Medellin cocaine cartel sent their families a tape-recorded
message praying for a quick resolution to the crisis, local news
media reported Oct. 7.
   It was the first word from any of the victims since they
disappeared in August and September.
   ``We hope that this will end well and that we will be able to be
with you soon,'' Diana Turbay de Uribe said in a message sent to
her father, former President Julio Cesar Turbay.
   The text, read over a national radio network, included
statements by a second kidnapped journalist, Azucena Lievano.
   The two women said they were in good health. They did not
mention the conditions of five other missing journalists. Nor did
they give any information on who was holding them.
   Lievano, a national TV reporter, and Turbay, editor of a
Colombian news magazine, were kidnapped with four other journalists
on Aug. 30.
   Francisco Santos, managing editor of Bogota's El Tiempo

   The drug traffickers have made no ransom demands, but a recent

   He is accused of threatening a man for trying to collect $921 in

The charges also claim he used the name and title of a deputy
attorney general in one of four telephone calls allegedly made to
the man.
   Beitchman said he will prove his innocence at a hearing on the

   The Supreme Court agreed to resolve a dispute
from Arkansas over the power of states to tax cable television
companies and subscribers.
   The court said Oct. 1 it will review a ruling that Arkansas may
tax cable TV as long as it also imposes the levy on similar
communication services, such as the unscrambling of satellite
signals.
   With millions of dollars in tax revenue at stake, the ruling was
challenged in separate appeals by both the state and cable
operators and subscribers.
   Arkansas in 1987 imposed its sales tax on cable TV service. The
law did not apply to those who own satellite dishes and subscribe
to services that unscramble satellite signals.
   Also exempted from the tax were all newspaper sales and magazine
subscription sales.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in February that the tax
unlawfully discriminated against cable TV service because satellite
service was excluded. But the state court said it is permissible
for the state to exclude the newspaper and magazine sales.

   Persistent uncertainty about possible war in
the Persian Gulf and fear of crude oil shortages sent retail gas
prices upward an average 6 cents per gallon over the past two
weeks, an industry analyst says.
   Since the Iraqi invasion of oil-rich Kuwait in early August, the
average price of gasoline nationwide has jumped 26{ cents a gallon
at the pump. Since the crisis began, an international embargo has
blocked all Iraqi oil exports.
   The sale of Kuwaiti oil also was banned to prevent Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein from making money on appropriated crude oil
reserves. Increases in oil market prices were passed on to
consumers quickly.
   ``The cause, of course, is the continued pass-through of higher

<HEAD>Sabah and Sarawak Tug at Ties That Bind</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Nobody suggests Malaysia is in
danger of breaking up, but the ties that bind its outermost states
to the federation occasionally seem frayed.
   Rumbles of discontent from Sabah and Sarawak, the territories
across the South China Sea in northern Borneo, are nothing new.
They are based on vast geographic, economic and ethnic differences,
and on pure politics.
   Grumbling is usually loudest at election time. Some state
politicians seek votes by accusing the central government of
neglect, and advocate more autonomy.
   In July elections for the 48-member Sabah state assembly, the
ruling Parti Bersatu Sabah made states' rights its focus and was
returned to power with 36 seats. It demanded a larger share of
federal revenue for Sabah and a review of the agreement under which
the state became part of Malaysia in 1963.
   Four party supporters were arrested during the campaign for
alleged involvement in a secessionist plot. Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad tried to cool anti-federal rhetoric with the warning: ``If
this trend is followed in other states, our nation will be split.''
   More than a month after the election, Information Minister
Mohamed Rahmat said Sabah and Sarawak had requested new talks on
their status in the federation.
   ``The state of the union is still intact,'' Mohamed told
reporters. ``In fact, it is getting better. We have survived as a
nation for 27 years, and both Sarawak and Sabah have progressed
under one roof.''
   Citing the merger of East and West Germany and overtures between
North and South Korea, he said: ``The time is for unification, not
secession.''
   Most of the problems are rooted in Malaysia's creation from
assorted British territories in post-colonial Southeast Asia.
   The 11 peninsular states of what was then Malaya gained
independence in 1957. Six years later, Malaya merged with
Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia.
   Brunei, the oil-rich sultanate nearly surrounded by Sarawak,
declined an invitation to join.
   Singapore, predominantly Chinese, was ousted in 1965 because its
leaders were viewed as a threat to the political control of
indigenous Malays.
   Sabah and Sarawak were granted concessions, including control of
immigration from the peninsula. Citizens of what is called
Peninsular Malaysia need passports to enter the states.
   They also counted on an Inter-Governmental Committee to protect
their interests in Kuala Lumpur. It was supposed to convene every
10 years to review progress of the outer states, but has not met
since 1973.
   ``There is support for an IGC meeting . . . and maybe it will be
held soon,'' Mohamed said.
   Officials in Sabah and Sarawak say their special status as
co-founders of the federation was chipped away over the years. Each
wants to be treated as one of three equal partners, not one of 13
states.
   ``I believe the people in Sabah and Sarawak do not hate
Peninsular Malaysians,'' Mohamed said. ``They consider us as all in
one family. It is only the politicians.''
   The Borneo states differ markedly from Peninsular Malaysia.
   Together, they are larger than all 11 western states, but their
population is much smaller.
   Sarawak has 1.6 million people Sabah has 1.4 million in a
national total of 17.4 million. Sabah's population inlcudes more
than 500,000 immigrants from the Philippines and Indonesia, most of
them illegal.
   Islam is Malaysia's official religion, but Sabah's governing
political party is led by Christians.
   Most Malaysians are ethnic Malays and there is a sizable Chinese
minority. Sabah and Sarawak have a variety of indigenous tribes,
many of which maintain traditional animistic beliefs.
   Sabah is one of the country's richest states because of timber,
oil and natural gas. Sarawak prospers from exporting tropical
hardwoods, natural gas and pepper.
   The two states keep only 5 percent of the revenue from their oil
and gas exports, as royalties, and want an increase.
   They retain all income from logging and largely ignore appeals
from Kuala Lumpur to ban the export of whole logs. In addition to
conserving the tropical forests, the federal government wants more
domestic timber processing, which would earn as much money from a
lower export volume.
   Some experts say Sabah will be logged out by the end of the
century. A report by the International Tropical Timber Organization
predicts the annual cutting rate in Sarawak of more than 13 million
cubic yards will deplete its remaining virgin forests within 11
years.

   Today is Saturday, Oct. 20, the 293rd day of 1990. There are 72
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Oct. 20, 1944, during World War II, Gen. Douglas MacArthur
stepped ashore at Leyte in the Philippines, 2{ years after he'd
said, ``I shall return.'' Said MacArthur: ``I have returned.''
   On this date:

<HEAD>Catholics in Ukraine Trying to Reclaim Church Property</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Petro Zeleniuch, a Ukrainian Catholic
priest, held services in his village hut for 28 years, covering the
windows so the KGB could not see what was going on.
   He was ordained secretly in 1961 by the outlawed Greek-rite
church and tended to the spiritual needs of Ukrainian peasants on
the border with Poland despite warnings, beatings and arrests.
   Now he ministers legally, traveling from village to village
every Sunday and performing pastoral duties during the week. In
Jarovov and nearby towns, grateful believers crowd around for a
word or a touch after each two-hour service.
   Less than a year since it was made legal again by order of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Ukrainian Catholic Church is
trying to reclaim its confiscated property, training new priests
and benefiting from the rising tide of Ukrainian nationalism.
   The faithful number more than 4.5 million, according to priests
and Catholic activists, many of whom see the church as a key
element in the movement for independence by the rich, populous
republic.
   Like other faiths in the Soviet Union, it is expected to benefit
from legislation approved in principle by the Soviet parliament
Sept. 26 that forbids government interference in religion.
   In Jarovov, the Catholic church is a 260-year-old jewel made of
wood, painted harvest yellow and protected by a shiny new steel
roof whose gleaming crosses stretch toward the sky.
   Sunday prayers are held behind the church, not inside.
Scaffolding fills the interior, which is being restored and
renovated.
   It has been decades since the building was used as a church.
Most recently it was a ``museum of atheism and religion,'' said
Zeleniuch's daughter-in-law Olga.
   Last year, she said, Zeleniuch and some local men went to the
Communist Party secretary, demanded the keys and got them. Theirs
was among the first successes of Ukrainian Catholics in winning
back churches seized 44 years ago.
   A greater victory was recorded Aug. 14 when authorities in Lvov,
the main city of the western Ukraine, returned the baroque 18th
century Cathedral of St. George after a year of agitation. It was
the seat of the church's last metropolitan, Andrei Sheptitsky, who
died in 1944.
   The golden-colored cathedral complex and adjoining
metropolitan's palace was transferred in 1946 to the
state-controlled Russian Orthodox Church, which until then had only
one church in the city of 770,000 people 625 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   Now a Catholic metropolitan is back in the cathedral, aided by a
few priests who formerly worked underground.
   One of them, the Rev. Zenovi Pavlish, said he was a factory hand
for 25 years and changed jobs whenever his bosses discovered his
real vocation. He conducted services in forests or private homes,
and is still getting used to wearing his robes in public.
   An estimated 100,000 faithful attended the cathedral's first
Catholic service Aug. 19, and in Moscow, the Russian Orthodox
patriarch was not pleased. Alexei II accused Ukrainian Catholics of
seizing the cathedral violently and demanded it back.
   Ukrainian Catholic priests deny any use of force.
   ``The return of the cathedral has great meaning,'' said the Rev.
Roman Shafran, assistant to the new metropolitan, Volodimir
Sterniuk. ``It is a symbol that our church exists, of its moral
strength and authority.''
   Pavlish said: ``There will be no going back. Our nation was on
its knees. Now it is standing up.''
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church was the chief religion of the
western Ukraine, a region historically under Polish or
Austro-Hungarian rather than Russian.
   Josef Stalin, who annexed the western Ukraine at the beginning
of World War II, banned the church in 1946 at about the same time
his generals were liquidating anti-Communist Ukrainian partisans.
   In the dictator's eyes, Ukrainian Catholicism was a bastion of
nationalism all the more suspect because of its ties to the
Vatican.
   Some Catholic churches were given to the tame Russian Orthodox
hierarchy, based in Moscow. Others were turned into warehouses,
museums, libraries or shops.
   Priests who did not go underground were arrested and deported to
labor camps, where many died.
   Beginning in 1987, under Gorbachev, some Ukrainian Catholic
priests came into the open, but the church was banned until last
December. Gorbachev legalized it just before his historic meeting
in Rome with Pope John Paul II.
   Today, ``officially everything is normal,'' Zeleniuch said,
``but in practice, they still make things difficult for us.''
   ``The shortage of priests, that is our misery,'' said Father
Muzychko, an exiled Ukrainian Catholic official now able to visit
from Rome.
   He said the church has only about 750 priests, some responsible
for 10 tp 15 villages, and is training 500 more, but the first
ordinations are two years away.
   Ivan Gel, an activist in the independence movement Rukh and
deputy leader of the regional legislature, said Catholics have
retrieved about 200 churches and want more. He said Catholics make
up 70 to 80 percent of Christians in the Ukraine, but have only 20
to 30 percent of the churches.
   ``These churches were built by the hands of Catholics,'' he
said. ``The Russian Orthodox Church does not want to recognize our
history.''
   A new Ukrainian Orthodox Church, autonomous from Moscow,
complicates matters. Catholics claim it was established in part to
compete with their faith.
   In some cases, three congregations - Catholic, Russian Orthodox
and Ukrainian Orthodox - fight over the same church.

<HEAD>The Other Option: Cut Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is an aspirin for the pain and suffering
the White House and Congressional budget negotiators have inflicted
on themselves, and that is to eliminate wasteful spending.
   It is an option frequently ignored, except by taxpayers, who are
widely accused of wanting lower taxes while simultaneously refusing
to accept cuts in Medicare, Social Security and similar benefits.
   But it is probably more accurate to ascribe to voters a logical
goal, that of cutting wasteful spending, rather than the
contradictory policy of which they have been accused, that of lower
taxes and more spending.
   There is hardly a family that doesn't understand the need for
cutting, especially today. With recession coming, if not here, and
with unemployment rising, they have been forced to retrench and
live within their incomes.
   Industry has been forced to do the same, to the extent that
``downsizing'' has become a fad word in the business lexicon. Even
philanthropic groups have felt the pinch and have reluctantly
limited their goals.
   The same has been asked of government but seldom is there an
answer.
   In 1984, the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control,
popularly called the Grace Commission after its chairman, J. Peter
Grace, recommended $424 billion in cuts over a three-year period.
   Last November, the General Accounting Office found $150 billion
in program waste, fraud and financial mismanagement. Last spring,
the Congressional Budget Office recommended reforms to yield
savings of $60 billion in the first year.
   As recently as last May the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank, offered a list of $130 billion in cuts that its
researchers said would cause minimal damage.
   Some idea of why such cuts aren't made came from that latest
analysis, by Scott Hodge, federal budget analyst for the
foundation. He would ask Congress to break an addiction to
deceptive, often deceitful porkbarrel spending.
   To an aid packgge earlier this year for Panama and Nicaragua,
for example, members of Congress tacked on their own special
interest expenditures for local, domestic projects that had nothing
to do with national interests.
   Hodge and his researchers cite examples of ``harmless''
expenditures, such as financing a study of the causes of rudeness,
lying and cheating on tennis courts and one seeking to determine
why people fall in love.
   Harmless? In themselves, perhaps so, but not in the damaging
lesson they send, that spending is in and saving is out, and that
misusing other people's money is acceptable so long as they remain
unaware of it.
   Besides, as members of Congress themselves concede, a little
spending oft repeated adds up to a lot. That ``lot'' can be
especially crucial to the economy in a recession attended by
unemployment and bankruptcies.
   Americans have been made especially aware of tax dangers from
the lips of President Bush, whose comments have included the
statement that ``when the government raises a dollar in revenues,
Congress spends a dollar fifty.''
   Perhaps, critics of waste are saying, voters aren't refusing to
accept the pain of an austerity budget so much as they are trying
to tell Congress that it must use public money wisely, honestly and
with restraint.

<HEAD>Dream Launch for Publisher Who Broke Away</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christopher Sinclair-Stevenson, a courteous Old
Etonian in the tough world of British publishing, broke away to set
up on his own after 28 years with one company and struck gold with
his first book.
   Sinclair-Stevenson Ltd. sold 60,000 copies of a life of
ever-popular Charles Dickens in less than two weeks at 19.95 pounds
($37.70) each. The sales sent ``Dickens'' to second place on The
Sunday Times best-seller list, behind a book on cricket.
   But what shook the book trade was the large sum of 650,000
pounds (nearly $1.3 million) offered by the fledgling independent
publisher to Peter Ackroyd, an admired writer who tackled Dickens
after doing other literary lives, some in novel form.
   ``It was an unusually large amount of money, but Ackroyd has a
good reputation and track record and the offer also covers a book
he is writing about William Blake,'' the publisher said.
   Sinclair-Stevenson, 51, talked in the office he set up with a
staff of 10 in a charming Kensington mews.
   He launched his company and the Dickens book Sept. 3, just over
a year after leaving the respected hardback publishing house of
Hamish Hamilton, his only employer since he left Cambridge
University with a modern languages degree. His last 15 years with
the firm were spent as managing director.
   He didn't like the changed atmosphere when the firm, which had
earlier been sold to the Canada-based Thomson group, was sold again
to Penguin, the giant paperback publisher.
   From friends and contacts he raised 2.4 million pounds ($4.5
million) to start his own company. When authors whose books he
edited found he was leaving they went with him, including Ackroyd.
   Sinclair-Stevenson is steering clear of paperback publishing,
and a large slice of Ackroyd's advance came from selling the
paperback rights in Dickens to other companies. Sales of the
hardback should comfortably make up the balance, he said.
   The new publisher's first catalog is half fiction and the rest
mostly travel, memoirs and contemporary history. Well-known writers
such as Paul Theroux, A.N. Wilson and J.K. Galbraith are on the
list, and of the 27 books, 20 are by authors from his old
employers.
   He handled most of the Hamish Hamilton authors who were
finalists over the years for the Booker Prize, the literary event
of the year in Britain.
   ``Most people thought William Boyd, who was a finalist in 1982
with `An Ice-Cream War,' should have been nominated again this year
for `Brazzaville Beach,' which we submitted. We will be in some
difficulty next year deciding which three of our novelists to put
in,'' the publisher said.
   Publishing is big business. Total book sales in Britain were
worth 2.2 billion pounds ($4.1 billion) last year. Book exports
amounted to a further 655 million pounds ($1.2 billion).
   The industry is dominated by about a dozen companies, among
them, Macmillan, the Oxford and Cambridge university presses and
HarperCollins and News International, which belong to media magnate
Rupert Murdoch.
   Publishing has changed vastly from the days when it was
considered a leisurely occupation for gentlemen. Revered imprints
have disappeared while others cling to their identities in the
embrace of multinationals and conglomerates.
   ``I think publishers take over other publishers to stop other
publishers taking them over. When they become big they want to be
strongly based everywhere,'' Sinclair-Stevenson said.
   ``A big organization has clout in the marketplace. It can afford
expensive authors, has more power in dealing with bookshops and a
bigger presence in the publishing world,'' he said.
   ``Corporate life is very different to that of an independent
publisher. I began to feel the imperatives in the Penguin group
were systems rather than books.
   ``Editors are concerned with publishing and selling but
conglomerates keep looking at their internal affairs. They work to
dotted lines, call meetings and tell people what to do. Their
authors get missed out,'' he said.
   ``When I left in July 1989, a lot of the authors I was handling
were my personal friends and I suppose they thought I was a good
publisher and would do their future books well. I think they felt
that once I'd gone, their connection with Hamish Hamilton ceased:
They wouldn't know anyone there.''
   Writers are important, Sinclair-Stevenson said. ``They lead
rather lonely lives. They are not going to an office every day and
they need encouraging to write and to live as well. I like to
publish authors I know and like. I find it difficult to publish
authors I don't like.''
   He thinks the spate of mergers isn't good for publishing.
   ``It concentrates too much power in too few hands, narrows the
choice for the author and reduces the contact between the author,
his agent and the publishers,'' he said. ``I think we did `Dickens'
as well as any conglomerate and possibly better, because it's our
lifeblood.
   ``We are hungrier,'' he said. ``We have no fat to live off.''

<HEAD>The Booker - Britain's Favorite Literary Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event of
the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the
award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient
Guildhall.
   The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly
$38,000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and
agriculture business.
   ``British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we
know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's
Ark,' his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000
over the next 23 weeks,'' said Christine Shaw of Book Trust.
   The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and
administers the prize.
   ``The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide
demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is
spectacular,'' said Shaw.
   The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker
and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant
literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
   British publishers can submit three new novels by British and
Commonwealth writers. There were 110 submissions last year.
   A management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians and
the sponsors chooses a jury of five: a writer or two, an academic,
a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or
critic.
   Each juror reads every book submitted, lists about six favorites
and meets the other jurors to select and announce six finalists.
   As public debate rages over who's in, who's out and who might
win, with bookmakers across the country calling the odds, the
jurors meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of
announcement day.
   This year's finalists: Beryl Bainbridge ``An Awfully Big
Adventure,'' A.S. Byatt ``Possession,'' Penelope Fitzgerald ``The
Gate of Angels,'' John McGahern ``Amongst Women,'' Brian Moore
``Lies of Silence'' and Mordecai Richler ``Solomon Gursky Was
Here.''

<HEAD>Seeds of Independence Sprout Again in Ukraine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LVOV, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fertile Ukraine has fed the Russian
Bear for centuries, but not by choice, and now the seeds of
independence are sprouting again on its bountiful steppes.
   Not only did Ukrainians remove the statue of Lenin in front of
the Lvov opera house last month, but they used jackhammers,
sledgehammers, chisels and bare hands to erase every sign of its
pedestal.
   Tens of thousands demonstrated against the Communist Party and
the Kremlin two weeks ago in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
   Political leaders in Lvov, a western city where secessionist
ferment is strong, predict the breakup of the Soviet Union as early
as spring. Then, they say, the Ukraine will claim a place among the
sovereign nations of Europe.
   ``Processes are speeding up,'' said physicist Orest Vloch,
leader in Lvov of the independence group Rukh, which means The
Movement in Ukrainian. ``Two months ago, we could not even imagine
Lenin's statue falling.''
   The Ukraine is the second largest of the Soviet Union's 15
republics.
   It produces one-quarter of the country's food, one-third of the
nuclear-generated electricity and much of the gas, oil and coal.
The Chernobyl nuclear accident of April 1986 occurred in the
Ukraine.
   Lvov, 625 miles southeast of Moscow and just 45 miles from newly
democratized Poland, already is firmly in the hands of
nationalists. The Ukraine's blue-and-white banner has replaced red
Soviet flags on public buildings, except for the KGB headquarters.
   Although the Ukrainian legislature declared sovereignty in
principle July 16, it still must pass specific laws. The Democratic
Bloc, outnumbered 3-2 by Communists, wants the Ukraine to have its
own currency, military, foreign and economic policy, and counts on
public pressure to make it possible.
   ``Our task in Rukh is to give the declaration real meaning,''
Vloch said. ``We can arouse people to fight for their rights.''
   Ivan Gel, deputy speaker of the Rukh-dominated regional
legislature in Lvov, said: ``We want Western countries to
understand that in Europe has arisen a country of 610,000 square
kilometers and 53 million people, or about the same size as France.
It has a right to be independent.''
   ``We are in the center of Europe and we were always European,''
he said of the Ukraine, which stretches from Poland and
Czechoslovakia in the west to the Black Sea.
   During an interview in his apartment, decorated with portraits
of dead and living Ukrainian heroes, Gel chided the West for
continuing to support Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He described the Soviet
president as ``a representative of the old totalitarian system''
who was merely trying to save it.
   In March elections, all of Lvov province's 24 seats in the
Ukrainian legislature were won by Rukh candidates. It also won
control of the regional legislature and the city council, which
authorized Lenin's removal on Sept. 14.
   Many in Lvov are not eager for independence, expecially those of
Polish or Russian ancestry. Employees at the Sputnik Hotel said the
Lenin monument should have been left standing, if only as a
historical artifact.
   Valerij Kubik, leader of the pro-independence Ukrainian
Republican Party in the central city of Khmelnitskiy, said during a
visit to Lvov that he favors independence, but it ``is not possible
yet.''
   He said attitudes change dramatically as one moves east in the
Ukraine.
   ``In Khmelnitskiy, the political spirit is much weaker than in
Lvov,'' he said. ``In our area, the Soviet government existed for
72 years, and here only since 1939,'' a reference to the Soviet
occupation of the western Ukraine, then Polish, at the start of
World War II.
   ``Our most difficult problem is Russification,'' he said.
``People of Ukrainian nationality used to have no right to speak in
their mother tongue and have not learned it.''
   Even today in Khmelnitsky, he said, ``there are only four
schools in Ukrainian. Here in Lvov it is another matter, with only
a few in Russian.''
   Aside from loosely organized Cossack rule three centuries ago,
the Ukraine has had little history of independence. Beginning in
the 19th century, however, nationalism flourished in the relatively
tolerant political atmosphere of Lvov, then known as Lemberg,
capital of Austrian Galicia.
   ``Traditionally, Lvov . . . is the scientific, cultural and
historical center of the western Ukraine and it influences the
eastern part of the Ukraine,'' said Maria Bocharskaya, who is
active in human rights groups.
   She said eastern Ukrainians had an increasing feeling of
historical identity, and beamed at the memory of a gathering in
August for the 500th anniversary of the first encampment of
Cossacks, the legendary warriors of the steppes.
   ``What spirit!'' she said. ``There were 50,000 people, and it
all started with prayers.''
   Mrs. Bocharskaya predicts the Soviet Union will disintegrate
``very soon, maybe even by this spring.''
   ``There is absolutely the same feeling'' in the eastern and
western Ukraine, she said. In the east, ``the people don't know the
language yet, but the spirit is the same as ours. . . . They want
what we want: freedom to be ourselves.''
   Vloch agreed that, ``from the economic, political and social
situation, the eastern Ukraine is ready for independence.''
   He said Rukh was strongly nationalist, but not blind to the
interests of Russians, Jews, Poles and other minorities.
   ``Defending the national interests . . . does not interfere with
other nationalities,'' he said. ``When we speak of nationalism now,
we mean we must try to obtain an independent state.''
   He said the Ukraine was eager to cooperate with other Soviet
republics, but ``without any imperial structures.''
   Gel said: ``The Western countries should begin to think about
their relations with us. According to Christian values, the strong
and the rich must help the poor and the helpless.''

   Everybody knows what an ounce of prevention
is worth. But the people in this ageless valley between the Blue
Ridge and Allegheny mountains are taking yesterday's adage a step
further.
   In today's vocabulary, they're betting that the bottom line on a
pound of cure is that it's also cost effective.
   The result is that this valley's poor children up to age 8,
America's neediest, have a ``medical home,'' as the physicians here
call it. That means the children of parents who can't pay may
nonetheless have a regular doctor of their own choosing whose
office they can visit regularly for scheduled shots and checkups
and for unexpected ailments, even in the middle of the night, even
on weekends, just like the wealthy kids.
   These are the children who live below the poverty line and thus
qualify for Medicaid but also children of the working poor who
don't qualify but still can't afford doctor bills and have no
medical insurance.
   They include, for example, Gerald and Roberta McCraw, both in
their 30s, who have 5-month-old twins, Angela and Amanda, and three
other children under 7, a third generation of children raised in
poverty.
   Life was tough enough when Gerald was earning minimum wage for a
37-hour week as a nursing home orderly. Last winter he came down
with rheumatoid arthritis. He worked when he could, through spring,
then not at all. Now he can't even lift his children for a hug.
   When one of the kids came down with something, a cough, an
earache, they went to a hospital emergency room or the twice-a-week
free clinic or maybe a public health office, though it closes at 5
p.m. Now they go to a doctor's office, an experience most American
children take for granted.
   ``I still don't believe this is happening to us,'' Roberta was
saying the other day, jiggling a baby girl in her lap. ``I can't
believe my children are going to grow up healthy, have good
teeth.'' She turned the baby to face her and held her close. The
mother's eyes moistened.
   ``CHIP is a miracle,'' she whispered. ``I used to not believe in
miracles, but CHIP is a miracle.''
   Its baptismal name was the Comprehensive Health Investment
Project. At age 2 it is now known throughout the valley simply as
CHIP. It is a cooperative effort of private doctors working with
the support and machinery of existing social welfare agencies and
health departments. If affording the same level of health care to
the needy and affluent alike is not a miracle, no one in America's
medical or social establishments seems to know of any other program
just like it.
   ``What it is,'' says Cabell Brand, chairman of Virginia's board
of health, ``is the result of community action. The real question
is, can it work elsewhere? The answer is, of course it can.''
   No, the real question is who pays?
   Except for some start-up cash from a foundation, CHIP runs on an
artful blend of money for a whole alphabet of programs already
funded - Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), Medicaid, and others.
   ``Suppose a child has a hearing loss and a speech delay,'' says
Peggy Balla, a public health nurse who became CHIP's director. ``Is
that a medical problem or an educational problem or both? You have
to cut through these narrow areas of concern.''
   One program, for instance, covered new mothers until a year
after the birth. That rule had to be changed to shift money to CHIP
during the child's critical first year of development. A
bookkeeping problem; the money was there all along.
   From its first stages of development, CHIP's healthy growth
appears to be ordained.
   ``We're already committed,'' says the health board's Brand, ``to
starting CHIP in four more areas next year, eight more the year
after that, 12 more the following year. Then it will cover all of
Virginia. There is no reason for it to stop at the state line.''
   Indeed, delegations from 16 other states have visited Roanoke to
have a look. ``A statewide program,'' says Brand, ``is in a better
position to become a line item in the state budget than is a local
budget.''
   The 1990 census reveals that 12.8 percent of Americans have
incomes below the official poverty level of $12,675 for a family of
four, a rate worse than 20 years ago, and that the children
continue to be the poorest of the poor. More than one in five
American children, 22.5 percent, live in poverty.
   ``It makes no sense,'' said Douglas Pierce, a Roanoke
pediatrician, ``that the group with the most health problems has
the least access to health care.''
   That bitter irony continued to nag Pierce after he had
confronted it for three years as president of the Virginia
Pediatric Society.
   ``Medicaid wasn't getting the job done,'' he said. ``Here in
Roanoke 42 percent of the people who qualified for Medicaid weren't
using it. They didn't know they could, or didn't understand how to
go about it.
   ``For whatever reason it didn't much matter because only about
one doctor in 10 would accept Medicaid patients anyhow. They would
give time at the twice-a-week free clinic and make other
contributions, but they wouldn't put up with the Medicaid
frustrations, the paperwork, the unkept appointments, all that goes
with it.'' That left nearly half the Medicaid money unspent and the
rest spent inefficiently.
   ``And then there were the working poor not sufficiently indigent
to qualify for Medicaid,'' said Pierce. ``What about them?''
   One day in early 1987 Pierce saw in the paper that Cabell Brand
of Roanoke had been appointed to the state board of health.
   ``I knew Cabell, I had treated his children,'' Pierce said. ``So
I picked up the phone and said, `Cabell, something has to be
done'.''
   Pierce called the right person.
   Cabell Brand is known throughout Virginia as just that, someone
who gets things done.
   He was an early volunteer in Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in
1964. He organized the Roanoke Valley's Community Action program,
Total Action Against Poverty (TAP), which grew into 29 agencies
tailored, as he says, ``to turning the needy into productive
citizens of the Roanoke Valley.''
   TAP is no patchwork of services, as is sometimes the case. It is
a coordinated movement tailored to the needs and ways of the
225,000 people of the Roanoke Valley. After one generation it can
point to a long list of gains in wresting families and individuals
from the whirlpool of poverty.

   TAP has become a model for anti-poverty efforts across the
nation. Three of its programs have been lifted whole to other
states. Another, which brought safe drinking water and toilets
first to rural homes in the Roanoke Valley, then all of Virginia,
eventually moved to Washington as a national program.
   CHIP became TAP's 30th agency. It fit right in.
   To get it going, Brand brought together doctors, public health
professionals, lawyers, TAP veterans, state and local officials,
``everyone we thought could help,'' he said.
   ``We identified the problem and worked out a plausible solution.
The state health department gave us $118,000 and we were on our
way.''
   They started the program June 16, 1988 with Pierce, the five
pediatricians in practice with him, and 100 patients. It went well.
After a year they grew to 300 patients and more doctors. That went
even better. Six months later the state upped its ante to $200,000
and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation of Michigan granted $1.5 million to
expand further. Last August Kellogg, impressed, came up with
another $2.3 million to spread CHIP across Virginia.
   Now CHIP has more than 900 patients enrolled. All six of the
valley's children's dentists participate, and all but three of its
19 family doctors and 14 pediatricians. (CHIP turned down the three
because they didn't cover on nights and weekends).
   ``We have a ways to go,'' said Peggy Balla, the CHIP director.
``We have identified 4,800 potential patients and hope to get them
all. We get more efficient every day. We've worked out a lot of
bugs. Our computer programs and all our experience will be helpful
in the replication of CHIP in other areas.''
   One of the bugs was getting prescriptions filled. The public
health office, which fills them cut-rate, closes at 5 p.m. The
valley's largest drugstore chain now provides 24-hour service at
even lower prices. Another bug: doctor appointments missed for lack
of transportation. A church donated a van.
   ``That's what community action is all about,'' said Cabell Brand
``It's the key to the whole program.''
   The CHIP staff includes six public health nurses and six
outreach workers. They work as teams, visiting each patient
regularly at home - case management, an essential of the whole
scheme. Each team has a caseload of about 150, which they agree is
too many but will improve with more staff.
   The nurse has a copy of the same records the doctor keeps. She
sees that his orders are followed,medication given, appointments
kept, the main complaints doctors had about the habits of Medicaid
patients.
   ``Just convincing the parents that they really do have a doctor
they can call any time they have a question, and persuading them to
do it, even in the middle of the night, may be the hardest job of
all,'' said one nurse, Connie Willet.
   ``But watching the way they light up when they finally come to
realize they are included in the health care system, which most of
us take for granted, is really satisfying. Sometimes I think their
new-found self esteem is the best medicine of all.''
   Willet's outreach worker teammate, Darlene Brown, was able to
come up with a second bed when Roberta McCraw had twins, has helped
her find diapers in an emergency, as well as food and clothes. The
five little McCraws also are regular patrons of CHIP's free Lending
Library. Not books, toys.
   Case workers tend to get personally interested in CHIP families.
One McCraw child now has a good winter coat that Darlene Brown's
own daughter outgrew. Another has a coat formerly worn by a child
of teammate Connie Willet.
   CHIP's doctors get paid at the Medicaid rate. If the patient
doesn't quite qualify for Medicaid the same rate applies.
Qualification in Virginia is the same as the federal minimum of 135
percent of the poverty level but CHIP stretches that to 150 percent
to take in the working poor. Doctors say it covers about 70 percent
of their regular fees.
   But CHIP does the billing, relieves the doctors of Medicaid
paperwork and further makes life easier by sending along with each
new CHIP patient a medical-history questionnaire already completed
by the case nurse. Not to mention seeing to it that his
instructions are followed and appointments kept.
   In the doctor's waiting room - or in the treatment room -
there's no way to tell a CHIP patient from any other. When it's
time to pay, the parent shows a CHIP card and that's that.
   Preventive medicine - shots, checkups, what the doctors call
well care - are, like fire prevention, obviously beneficial but
hard to measure in dollars. How much in future medical bills will
CHIP save by giving children a healthy start? The Children's
Defense Fund, a national group, says the annual saving is 10
percent. Health insurance companies, with one eye on that huge
group of uninsured, is keeping the other eye on CHIP.
   ``We have a chance to do some blow-away things here, it seems to
me,'' said John Berry, head of Blue Cross-Blue Shield in Virginia.
   Blue Cross has supported CHIP from the beginning, completely
outfitting the CHIP office in Roanoke with furniture and equipment.
   One major financial effect of CHIP is apparent right now from a
recent survey of 10,000 children's visits to the Roanoke Memorial
Hospital emergency room.
   It found that nearly half, 46 percent, were between 3 p.m. and
midnight, and that fewer than 15 percent were ``justifiable
emergency room visits,'' according to Dr. Preston Boggess, director
of pediatric education.
   ``In an emergency room, with no records of the patient
available, you have to practice defensive medicine,'' Boggess said.
``That means extensive tests and lab work to cover all the
possibilities.
   ``They are mostly unnecessary, always costly and take time from
real emergencies. But some people have no place else to take a sick
child.''
   Roberta McCraw has.
   ``The baby was fussing and running a fever and I was scared to
death,'' she said.
   ``I had never called my doctor at night and didn't know whether
I should maybe just go ahead to the emergency room.
   ``But I called, and he said bring her in.
   ``It wasn't my doctor but was one in the same building. It as
his turn to work that night.
   ``He examined her and looked at her records and in a minute
said, Mrs. McCraw, Amanda's teething. `Take her home, she'll be
just fine.'
   ``And she was.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It's a temple of knowledge like no other, a

no other library in the world can come as close.

   You can get mad at Congress across the street
or the Supreme Court next door or the White House down the avenue.
But you can hardly get mad at the Library of Congress.
   It is smaller than almost any arm of government yet mightier
than the Pentagon, richer than the Treasury and just plain bigger
than all of us.
   Here, behind the commanding bronze doors, along the endless,
whispering stacks, in the reverent hush of the reading rooms, under
the ornate statues and soaring mosaics, here more than in any other
single place on earth reside the collective knowledge and wisdom of
humanity. This is the tip of man's reach, so far.
   An extraordinary place, a library, a temple, a museum, a rich
man's attic.
   Socrates is a tenant here. So is Groucho Marx. So are Johannes
Brahms and Jelly Roll Morton, George Washington and Adolf Hitler,
Albert Einstein and Donald Duck.
   Browsing, you might care to see Thomas Jefferson's rough draft
of the Declaration of Independence or Harry Houdini's postcard to
his mother. The Gutenberg bible or ``Weird Tales'' among the pulp
magazines. Maps used by sailors before Columbus or maps of the back
side of the moon or maps of the distribution of black-owned
businesses in New York City.
   A handbill offering a $300 reward for the return of three
runaway ``Negro boys - Albert, Sam and Bailey,'' Albert being the
one with whiskers and Sam the one with a scar over his left eye,
about 35 years old.
   You might also want to see Abe Lincoln's handwritten draft of
the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves, maybe Albert,
Sam and Bailey, too. Or a Summerian tablet written 2,040 years
before Christ. Or the Johnny Carson Show taped last night.
   Altogether, a place of boggling scope, unique in the world,
begun 190 years ago by a poor, new country that couldn't know what
it was getting into. The hope was that the library would ``enable
statesmen to be correct in their investigations and, by a becoming
display of erudition and research, give a higher dignity and
brighter luster to truth.''
   Whether Congress has added luster to truth or even a semi-gloss
is an open question. But the Library of Congress did its part and
now is a world capital of superlatives:
   The most books (20 million) in the most languages (470); the
most maps (3,500,000); the largest law library; the most complete
global collection of government documents; the most Stradivari
instruments (five); the most flutes (1,600), including Frederick
the Great's; the most motion pictures (100,000); the most
television programs (80,000), including, you'll be relieved to
know, one of ``Chinese Cajun Cooking'' and the complete speeches of
Fidel Castro.
   More than a library, this is a massive multimedia storehouse of
yesterday and today. And tomorrow?
   ``It's been said that the only crystal ball man has is a
rear-view mirror,'' says James H. Billington, the librarian of
Congress. ``Here, in this place we have the widest angle rear-view
mirror in the world.''
   The mirror grew that wide because this library, unlike other
national libraries, belonged to a nation of immigrants, to a past
of many languages, cultures and histories. And this nation, unlike
others, declared the pursuit of happiness an inalienable right.
   ``We must seek the whole experience - whatever has filled the
consciousness of Americans past and present,'' said Daniel
Boorstin, former librarian. ``In the United States, the pursuit of
happiness is everybody's business, and any American institution
which forgets that is failing in its mission.''
   Even at the start, with only 3,000 volumes down the hall from
Congress, for which a member would leave the floor ``to get proof
of my assertions,'' this library housed more than the predictable
volumes of history, law and government. It also had current English
plays, poetry and novels.
   From that beginning, it grew to a truly international library
seeking to gather ``everything known by all cultures.'' It now has
5 million books in English and 15 million in foreign languages. It
has more volumes of Russian and Japanese literature than exist
anywhere else outside of those countries.
   It has Charles Dickens' walking stick and the contents of
Lincoln's pockets the day he died, including an unexplained
Confederate $5 bill. It has Hitler's last library in that bunker in
Berlin and the last to console Czar Nicholas in the Winter Palace
in Petersburg.
   It has the papers of 23 presidents, Sigmund Freud and Danny Kaye
and the personal photo album of Herman Goering. It has American
folk ballads recorded in jails, remote mountain villages and Indian
pueblos and Franz Lizst's manuscript of his first Piano Concerto
with his changes pasted in with paper flaps.

   It has the first book printed in America (the Bay Psalm Book of
1640), the radio scripts of W.C. Fields, the surrender signed by
Washington and Cornwallis at Yorktown, and Alexander Graham Bell's
original working sketch of something he called ``an instrument for
the transmission of vocal utterance by telegraph,'' which, when he
invented it, Don Ameche called the telephone.
   Emboldened by its landlord to acquire ``all library materials
currently published throughout the world which are of value to
scholarship,'' the Library of Congress has grown to three buildings
named after Jefferson, Adams and Madison. The Great Hall and the
Main Reading Room of Jefferson are closed for restoration work.
That leaves 22 reading rooms.
   Madison alone is the largest library building in the world, and
among the behemoths in this town ranks third in size behind the
Pentagon and the FBI. Every room is wired for television and
computer data transmission. Billington is pushing a program to make
this a ``library without walls'' and to share its materials
electronically with libraries around the country.
   Congress remains its first priority. Nine hundred specialists
out of a total staff of 5,000 work exclusively for the
Congressional Research Service, which is described as the biggest
think tank in creation. They may not take calls from any other
branch of government, be it the White House or Supreme Court. The
rest of the libary is open to all, even the president.
   The specialists supply senators and representatives with cost
projections, pro and con studies, legislative analyses and answers
to a multitude of questions.
   Who is this Saddam Hussein? How much oil do we import from Iraq?
... How many Americans are buried in Flanders' Field (asked during
debate on the flag amendment)? (Answer: 368) ... What is the
significance of the Maltese falcon (asked by a member about to meet
with representatives of Malta)? ... Did Vince Lombardi say,
``Winning isn't everything - it's the only thing?'' (No, it was Red
Sanders of Vanderbilt.)
   The original Library of Congress was destroyed at the tender age
of 14 when the British burned the Capitol in 1814. School kids are
rarely told that American troops did the same thing to the Canadian
Parliament and library the year before.
   In any case, Congress needed a library and Tom Jefferson, in
retirement with no pension, needed money. He sold Congress his
library, one of the best outside Europe, 6,487 volumes for $23,950.
They came bumping over the pitted roads of Virginia in 10
horse-drawn wagons.
   Jefferson was the library's first hero. The second was Lincoln's
choice of librarian, a dynamo with the catchy name of Ainsworth
Rand Spofford. He yearned for ``oceans of books and rivers of
information.''
   He got himself a tidal wave by persuading Congress to move the
Copyright Office from Interior to the Library. Henceforth, anyone
claiming a copyright on any book, map, chart, play, music,
engraving, cut, print, photograph or negative thereof had to send
two copies to the Library. You can get a lot of free books, etc.,
that way and the Library did and does.
   Books etc. were soon spilling over into the halls, closets,
basement and committee rooms of Congress. The Library desperately
needed its own building.
   What it got in 1897 was one of Uncle Sam's most lavish
productions, a temple of culture for an adolescent nation still
growing, strong and rich and showing off. Fifty-two leading artists
and 20 sculptors and tons of majestic marble from around the world
were used to show that Uncle could rise above materialism.
   As a result, Demosthenes, Emerson, Goethe, Franklin, Macauley,
Dante and many others emerge larger than life. The Main Reading
Room rises 125 feet to a magnificent dome ornamented with
seashells, griffins, cherubs and garlands. The ceilings of the
Great Hall are done in stained glass, 23-carat gold leaf, marble
mosaics, stucco sculpture and huge frescoes.
   Symbolism abounds. ``History'' is a lady in a toga holding a
backward-facing mirror. ``Art'' is a nude female holding a model of
the Parthenon flanked by Michelangelo and Beethoven. Columbus and
Robert Fulton flank ``Commerce.'' A female primly togaed and
holding perfectly balanced scales presides over ``Good
Government.'' The woman in ``Corrupt Legislation'' shows sinful
decolletage in her toga and her scales are unbalanced by gold on
one.
   A compelling place, soaring, corny and altogether beautiful.

thick-billed kingbird and white-eared hummingbird.
   -Such reptiles and amphibians as the bunchgrass lizard, Colorado
River toad, green ratsnake, ridgenose rattlesnake and Sonoran
mountain king snake;
   -Plants ranging from the Arizona rainbow cactus to the
Chiricahua Mountain larkspur, the green-flowered fishhook cactus,
night-blooming cereus, Apache pine, Schoff's yucca, Pinaleno
Mountain plummera, Thurber campion and white-flowered visnagita.
   ``In addition to rare animals,'' says Kate Brower, New Mexico
development coordinator for the Conservancy, ``there are pronghorn
antelope, mountain lion, black bear, badger, collared peccaries,
Gould's wild turkey, desert cottontail, golden eagle, greenback and
great blue heron, coatimundi and ringtail cats.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Today, as armies mass for war on the desert
sands of Arabia, aging veterans of another desert battle will
gather 1,000 miles away to honor their fallen comrades. They fought
at El-Alamein on Egypt's northern coast in an epic clash of tanks
that stopped Germany's Desert Fox and gave the allies a crucial
victory in World War II.

   EL-ALAMEIN, Egypt (AP) - They were young soldiers, far from
home, huddled in desert sands, waiting for the nighttime sky to
explode.
   The last time some of them would ever look at their watches was
9:39 p.m., Oct. 23, 1942. In one minute the wails of bagpipes would
summon the guns of Bernard Law Montgomery's 8th Army, the Desert
Rats, and the final battle at El-Alamein would begin.
   Such abombardment had not been seen since World War I. What
followed was one of history's great tank battles along Egypt's
barren but beautiful northern coast.
   How many died to turn the tide of German victories, nobody
knows. But after El-Alamein, it was the Allied forces marching
forward. After El-Alamein, Adolf Hitler's dreams of world conquest
began to sour.
   Lance Barnard, a former deputy prime minister of Australia,
served with the 9th Australian Division, the Diggers, who took the
brunt of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's fury at the end of
El-Alamein's final battle.
   ``Each generation seems to produce another dictator and somebody
has to go out and stop him,'' Barnard said.
   Twelve hundred Diggers are among the 7,354 men of the combined
British Commonwealth forces buried at El-Alamein. They proved that
Germany's seemingly invincible Rommel, the Desert Fox, and his
famous Afrika Korps could be beaten after all.
   Six days after the Allied victory on Nov. 4, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill gave El-Alamein its place in World War
II history: ``This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of
the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''
   Patience would prove him right. The ordeal of Stalingrad was
then only beginning, American Marines were digging in at
Guadalcanal and D-day - the beginning of the end - still was almost
two years away.
   Historians debate whether El-Alamein was the most crucial battle
of the war, but none ignores what happened here.
   After sweeping through Libya, Axis forces under Rommel sped
along the only road on northern Egypt's coastline toward Cairo, the
Suez Canal and the rich oil fields of Persia. They could smell
victory.
   Allied commander Montgomery had other ideas. He sent escape
vehicles to the rear and told his troops: ``If Alamein is lost,
Egypt is lost. If we cannot stay at Alamein alive, we will stay
there dead.''
   The cost of winning and losing the battles of El-Alamein, which
raged off and on from July until November 1942, was staggering.
Dead still lie in unfound desert graves, but the number of
casualties on both sides has been estimated at 65,000. The Allies
suffered 13,500 dead and wounded. Half the forces of Germany and
Italy were killed, wounded or captured.
   The opposing forces were uneven. Montgomery had 11 divisions,
about 210,000 men. He had 1,200 tanks, more than 1,000 field and
medium guns, adequate fuel and ammunition and a short line of
communications to his home base in Cairo.
   Rommel commanded four German and eight Italian divisions and
some independent units. He had no more than 108,000 men and 600
tanks but plenty of artillery. Also, he relied on 5 million mines
planted in the 50-mile-wide El-Alamein bottleneck between the
Mediterranean Sea and the quicksand of the Qattara Depression. His
fatal flaws were the lack of fuel and a steady supply line.
   The battle of El-Alamein should have been a showpiece for tank
warfare. It wasn't. Tanks broke down - the tinny Italian version
was nicknamed ``self-propelled coffin'' - and the Qattara to the
south prevented brilliant manuevering.
   Montgomery lost 600 tanks, about the number Rommel had when the
battle began, and by Nov. 2 Rommel was fighting with only 30.
   In his diary Rommel lamented the battle: ``Rivers of blood were
spilled over a miserable strip of land which in normal times even
the poorest Arab would never have bothered about.''
   Today's El-Alamein is not much better. But its stilled
battlefields, a military museum and monuments of the famous battles
beckon visitors to make the four-hour trek from Cairo.
   Each year since 1978, individual countries have put aside
differences to honor the fallenWorld War II desert fighters of all
sides at observances on the Sunday nearest the Oct. 23 battle
anniversary. The service, attended by hundreds of diplomats,
veterans and well-wishers, rotates among the Commonwealth Cemetery
and the German and Italian memorials.
   This year's is Oct. 21 at the Italian monument atop a hillside
overlooking the Mediterranean.
   El-Alamein's newest memorial is a simple but poignant obelisk
honoring the Australian Diggers. The 20-foot-tall monument of
locally quarried limestone and Australian granite stands before the
Commonwealth Cemetery and its thousands of Allied dead.
   The monument was dedicated in the spring of 1989, and for the
Australians it was long overdue.
   Barnard, the former deputy prime minister, and Everard Baillieu
of Melbourne, a gunner severely wounded at El-Alamein, spearheaded
the campaign for a monument to honor their fallen comrades-in-arms.
   ``It's such an emotional experience for me to go back to
Alamein. It was the place we stopped Rommel's advance, forced him
to go back, leave North Africa,'' Barnard said by telephone from
Melbourne. He has made the pilgrimage four times.
   ``The first visit I made I was looking at the graves of my
comrades, the graves of my friends. Each time I come I believe more
and more that victory was made possible because of the efforts of
the 9th Division.''
   Melbourne attorney Frank Minotti, another veteran of the 9th,
has written a division history. He wrote that until the obelisk,
``no one visiting the cemetery would find anything to tell them
what part the Australians played in those famous battles, and in
what circumstances those in the cemetery gave their lives.''
   There are guest registers at the memorials for the Commonwealth,
German and Italian soldiers. Few leave El-Alamein without shedding
a tear.
   Last July 18, Australian Margaret Gillespie visited the
Commonwealth Cemetery. ``My brother Jim, always remembered by his
family,'' she wrote.
   David and Myrna McDonell of Brisbane: ``May there never be cause
for such a sad place.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - He was an American newspaperman who went to
Japan 100 years ago to teach English and fell in love, with the
country. In the following years Lafcadio Hearn wrote extensively
about Japan and its people and admirers say he was one of the few
Westerners who truly understood the culture. While his work is
little known in the West today, the Japanese have never forgotten
him.

   Lafcadio Hearn gazed out through his
cedar-framed window, contemplated a lotus pond surrounded by irises
and moss-covered rocks and listened to the cicadas buzzing on a
plum branch.
   He turned to his waist-high desk and put pen to paper. He wrote
a melancholy prophecy that is still valid 100 years after he
arrived in this small lakeside city in Izumo, the mythical Province
of the Gods.
   ``Already a multitude of gardens, more spacious and more
beautiful than mine, have been converted into rice fields or bamboo
groves,'' he wrote. ``And the quaint Izumo city, touched at last by
some long-projected railway line ... will swell, and change, and
grow commonplace, and demand these grounds for the building of
factories and mills.
   ``Not from here alone, but from all the land the ancient peace
and the ancient charm seem doomed to pass away. For impermanency is
the nature of all things, more particularly in Japan.''
   The Greek-Irish journalist from the United States had fallen in
love with Japan, although he became increasingly ambivalent as it
modernized. And while Hearn has largely slipped into obscurity in
the West, the Japanese have never forgotten him, particularly in
this centennial year.
   Admirers say he was one of the few Westerners who truly
understood Japanese culture, possibly because he considered it
superior in many ways to the industrialized West.
   ``He loved the ordinary life, the daily life of the Japanese
people,'' says Kenji Zenimoto, professor of intercultural studies
at Shimane University in Matsue and president of the national
Lafcadio Hearn Society.
   Elementary school pupils around the country still read Hearn's
Japanese ghost stories, and high-school students practice English
with his evocative travel writings. University students study his
philosophical essays, and scholars argue passionately over his 12
major books and hundreds of articles and letters.
   The largest celebration of his centennial began in Matsue on
Aug. 30, exactly 100 years after Hearn arrived at age 40 to teach
English in the city's middle school.
   Hearn wrote about the town in ``The Chief City of the Province
of the Gods,'' part of ``Glimpses of an Unfamiliar Japan,''
published in 1894.
   Here, between a lake and lagoon near the Japan Sea about 390
miles west of Tokyo, one can see that much about Japan has changed
and much remains eternal.
   Part of Hearn's garden remains, including the pond and ancient
pines. But other houses now encroach upon the northern portion,
where wild flowers and grasses once extended to the wooded hills
far beyond.
   The Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum displays Hearn's desk, the
shell he blew when he wanted his pipe lit, his glasses and socks
and even a lock of his hair preserved in a stone monument.
   There are displays which tell of Hearn's Japanese wife, their
four children, and his teaching posts elsewhere in Japan, including
Imperial University in Tokyo.
   Next door is the lotus-pond garden and the house where Hearn
lived after his romance with Japan turned into marriage. Although
he left Matsue in November 1891, he was to stay in Japan until he
died in 1904.
   He wed Setsu Koizumi, the daughter of an impoverished samurai
family, became a Japanese citizen and a Buddhist and adopted the
name by which he is known to most Japanese today: Yakumo Koizumi.
Yakumo, which means ``eight clouds,'' is a poetic version of Izumo.
   As a child, Hearn had been virtually abandoned by his Irish
father and Greek mother. After working as a reporter in Cincinnati,
New Orleans, New York and the West Indies, he thought he had
finally found a peaceful home in old Japan.
   But Japan was in the throes of modernization begun in the 1868
Meiji revolution. And just as marriages occasionally succumb to
disenchantment, Hearn increasingly found fault with Japan.
   Historian Kaoru Sekita, a Hearn scholar at Waseda University in
Tokyo, says Hearn predicted that Japan could never successfully
adopt some Western ideas, particularly democratic political
processes. Hearn thought ``the modes of Japanese human relations
had not fundamentally changed since mythological times,'' Sekita
says.
   Hearn's collection of essays, written shortly before he died,
also discusses the problems that arise from Japan's emphasis on
group loyalty over individual enterprise. Hearn warned of a ``rise
of new power'' in Japan - an ``oligarchy of wealth'' that would
enslave the people.
   Hearn is not universally admired in Japan. Some critics say his
romantic portrayal of old Japan perpetuates the myth that Japan is
unique, a misconception they say still keeps Japan from
participating fully in the international community. Others condemn
his work as a defense of ultra-conservatism.
   ``Lots of people who love Hearn today are nostalgic about the
old Japan,'' says Yuzo Ota, associate professor of history at
McGill University in Montreal. ``They are modernized intellectuals
who like his romanticized picture of Japan. They feel threatened by
their own mixed identity.''
   Hearn didn't have a simple love affair with Japan but a
complicated love-hate relationship, Ota says.
   The accepted view that Hearn loved Japan ``is based on
suppression of evidence'' in Hearn's letters to friends and other
scholars, he says.
   Zenimoto says some of Hearn's letters were cut for publication
to remove passages critical of Japan, including some that
castigated its rigid bureaucratic, military and educational
systems. Also cut were some of Hearn's wry observations about sex
in Japan, which was more open in the late 1800s than it is now, he
says.
   Zenimoto has written to about 10 U.S. libraries with extensive
holdings of Hearn letters in an attempt to compile a definitive
collection. He and his assistant, Yuko Kawauchi, also are working
on a Hearn catalog that will list everything written by and about
him. So far they have listed 1,900 items and have an estimated
7,000 to go.
   Hearn's 28-year-old great-grandson, Bon Koizumi, curator of the
Hearn Memorial Museum, prepared a special collection for the
festival. It includes manuscripts, classroom notes of Hearn's
students and English-language textbooks he prepared for his wife
and children.
   Zenimoto, Ota and Koizumi were among a dozen scholars
participating in the five-day festival, which included
presentations on Hearn's newspaper stories on macabre events in
Cincinnati, the effect of Hearn's Irish roots on his work, Hearn's
and other Westerners' interpretations of Shinto, Japan's indigenous
religion, and Hearn's ghost stories.
   ``Lafcadio Hearn was an ideal foreigner to understand Japan, but
he also understood cultural shock and the culture gap,'' Zenimoto
says. ``We must understand more minutely his life, but we must not
idolize him.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - When a woman goes to prison, often it is her
family that suffers the most. And here in a remote corner of West
Virginia, near the federal prison for women at Alderson, there is a
group that cares. At the Alderson Hospitality House, friends and
loved ones of women behind bars can find food and lodging and a
sympathetic ear.

<DATELINE>ALDERSON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a month, Joe Gump leaves his home in
Bloomingdale, Mich., and drives all night to visit his wife here in
the Allegheny Mountains of rural West Virginia.
   Gump is a 62-year-old retired chemical engineer and businessman.
His wife, Jean Gump, is a 63-year-old inmate at the
minimum-security Federal Prison Camp of Alderson, serving eight
years for helping trash some missile silos in Missouri during an
anti-nuclear protest in 1986.
   As a result of his monthly visits, Gump has found a home away
from home in this remote town of 1,000 people, where the federal
prison, which holds about 800 women, is the biggest industry.
   He's a regular at the privately funded Alderson Hospitality
House, which opened in 1977 to provide lodging and meals for
friends and families of prisoners, the first of its kind in the
nation.
   The three-story white house, built in 1889 as a boarding house,
has 11 guest rooms and two bathrooms to house up to 35 people,
including children. It is operated by Dee and John Vodicka, strong
advocates of prisoners' rights.
   ``You put someone in prison to punish them for a crime, but
you're really punishing the people they leave behind,'' says Joe
Gump.
   In their case, that's a lot of people. Joe and Jean Gump raised
12 children.
   And they're the kind of people the Vodickas want to help.
   ``These families are us, given the same circumstances,'' Mrs.
Vodicka says. ``That saying, `There but for the grace of God, go
I,' is so true. We learn that every weekend.''
   Most of the inmates at the Alderson prison are blacks or
Hispanics from big cities, most serving time for drug offenses or
tax evasion. Faye Pollard, an assistant to the warden, estimates
that 60 percent of them are mothers.
   ``What cost is prison wreaking on the children?'' Mrs. Vodicka
asks. ``What is their future? Fifteen or 20 years down the line,
that anger is going to need to be handled?.''
   The Vodickas feel most of the prisoners should be sentenced to
home confinement, work release and drug rehabilitation.
   ``I think the vast majority of women here could be let out today
with no effect on society,'' Vodicka says. ``There are few women up
here who have committed heinous crimes like you read about. They
have offended society by breaking laws, but they could have been
diverted short of prison.''
   She cites the Gump case.
   Jean Gump and four friends entered a nuclear missile site at
Knob Noster, Mo., on Good Friday, 1986, and attacked the silos with
sledgehammers. She poured her own blood on the silo and then the
five waited 45 minutes for the police to arrive and arrest them.
   After Jean went to prison, Joe got involved with civil
disobedience. He used the same tools and banners that Jean used
when he staged his own protest in 1987 on the day the atomic bomb
was dropped on Hiroshima.
   He got a different judge, and was sentenced to two years in
prison.
   But Alderson also has been home to some notorious offenders,
including Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme and Sandra Good, disciples of
Charles Manson, convicted in the Sharon Tate murders, and Sarah
Jane Moore. Fromme and Moore tried to assassinate President Gerald
Ford just 17 days apart.
   Moore and Fromme were transferred to other prisons after they
tried to escape and are serving life sentences. Good was paroled in
1985.
   John Vodicka, 42, is no stranger to prisons. He worked as a
chaplain for the San Francisco Bay area county jails, as a prison
rights advocate in New Orleans and in a program for the homeless in
Atlanta before moving to West Virginia.
   Alderson House has a $26,000 budget and receives no federal
funding, Vodicka says. About half the money comes from guests and
the remainder from private or church donations.
   There are few frills.
   ``None of us receives a salary. Practically all of it goes back
into the house for upkeep and utilities,'' Vodicka says. ``Food and
maintenance are the big items.''
   Furniture is donated by churches and individuals. Guests often
bring food instead of money.
   Visiting children play with the Vodicka children, Gabriel, 5,
and Luke, 2, and Samuel, born Sept. 12.
   The large kitchen table has several highchairs around it.
Colorful alphabet magnets, an arm's length away on the
refrigerator, are a big draw to the children who like to spell out
their names and leave messages.
   The Vodickas share the chores. Volunteers frequently live with
them.
   The Vodickas are the third couple to run the house. Dick Dieter
and Maggie Louden opened the hospitality house in 1977, basing
their philosophy on the Roman Catholic worker movement of the 1930s
and 1940s. The movement emphasized a simple lifestyle based on
pacifism and helping those in need.
   After another couple ran the house for two years, the Vodickas
took over in 1986.
   Just to the right of the house's front door is the office from
which the Vodickas coordinate guest lists and compile three
newsletters that promote their views against the death penalty and
for prisoner's rights. They live in two private rooms behind the
office.
   Now the Vodika family is looking for someone to take over the
house. With their new addition to the family, they are outgrowing
the two small rooms.
   ``Every time the house has need someone or something, it has
come through,'' Mrs. Vodicka says.

   Robert Urich, best known as a street-wise
detective, moves away from the urban battleground in a new TV
comedy series, ``American Dreamer.'' He plays a modern philosopher
in a small town.
   The NBC show offers a mixture of humor, introspection,
remembrances and fantasy focusing on Urich, who portrays a former
network journalist seeking a new life after his wife is killed by a
terrorist while they are on assignment together.
   The TV reporter quits his high-paying, high-profile job to move
his son and daughter to a small town to write a weekly
human-interest column. His new assistant, played by Carol Kane,
says, ``Human interest? Oh, you mean fluff.'' Each episode becomes
a meandering odyssey as he explores his innermost thoughts en route
to arriving at his column.
   ``The way he thinks about things is the nut of the show,'' Urich
says in an interview at his home on the edge of the Hollywood
Hills. ``The writing of a column can be a catalyst for him to
explore some personal experience. The column is his life, and his
life is the column.
   ``In a novel a writer can take a chapter to examine a
character's feelings. We can do it in a snap, by having him step
into limbo. The stage suddenly goes black except for the spotlight
on him. We're experimenting with different lighting techniques. The
limbo is a chance for us to not complete scenes, but to let him
explain what happened or re-create a scene from his past.''
   Despite more than a decade in tough-guy roles, Urich sees
``American Dreamer'' as a return to his roots.
   ``I started out on the straw hat circuit, doing `Father of the
Bride' and all that stuff,'' he says. ``When I came to L.A. the
first thing I did was `Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice.' I was told it
was comedy and it's difficult. You have to read. I said, `Wait,
that's what I do for a living.' Then I was in `Soap' and `Tabitha.'
So it's familiar, yet different.
   ``The way they work here is amazing. You don't have a finished
script when you start out. At least 80 percent of it's rewritten.
It's an exploration by the actors and writers. The writers listen
and watch and fine-tune it. Finally, by the end of the week you've
got it down. When the audience comes in it's like opening night.
The writers and producers dress up, send flowers, and come in ready
to have a good time.''
   The show's from Gary David Goldberg's UBU Productions, which
last did ``Family Ties.''
   Of his past comedies, Urich may be best remembered as the sexy
tennis pro whose dalliances and murder got ``Soap'' off to a
rousing start in 1977.
   He was a uniformed police marksman in ``S.W.A.T.'' in 1975-76,
but turned detective in ``Vega$'' in 1978. It lasted three years,
then came ``Gavilan,'' in which he played a sort of waterlogged
secret agent. It lasted about three episodes. ``Spenser: For
Hire,'' based on Robert Parker's brooding, brainy, brawny detective
also lasted three years.
   ``There's been a lot of talk about a `Spenser' movie,'' Urich
says.
   ``Spenser: For Hire'' was filmed on location in Boston and Urich
moved his family back from Boston only a year ago to concentrate on
TV movie projects.
   He played a Texas Ranger in the acclaimed miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove'' and a convicted wife killer in ``Blind Faith.'' During the
summer he co-starred with Teri Garr in the NBC movie ``A Quiet
Little Neighborhood, A Quiet Little Murder.''
   Another movie, ``83 Hours Till Dawn,'' will be televised by CBS
on Sunday, Nov. 11. He plays a father whose daughter, Samantha
Mathis, is kidnapped by Peter Strauss.
   ``My series have never gone beyond three years,'' Urich says.
   He named his sailboat ``Season Three.''
   ``I bought it with third-season money,'' he says. ``My family's
not into sailing. It got to be too expensive. I'd just go down and
sit on it once a month. I have to find something and name it
`Season Seven.' Maybe it'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
   Urich is married to actress Heather Menzies, and they have two
children.
   He has not yet sold his house in Massachusetts, and his
undersized new home here is up for sale.
   ``If the kids have the TV on we can't talk,'' he says. ``So I
put it on the market. It's a soft market, but I'm not in a hurry. I
called my architect in Boston and asked him to draw up a four-phase
plan for renovating this house in case we stay.''

   Whether he wants to or not, Tony Goldwyn seems
destined to become a movie star.
   He's got the looks - dark blond curly hair, ice-blue eyes and a
slightly off-center smile.
   He's got the luck - playing the yuppie Wall Street villain in
``Ghost,'' the surprise movie hit of the summer, a romantic fantasy
that bested Beatty, swamped Schwarzenegger and even wiped out
Willis.
   He's got the training - nearly a decade of stage and television
work, including studying two years at the London Academy of Music
and Dramatic Art and playing half dozen summers at the Williamstown
Festival in Massachusetts.
   He's got the pedigree, descended from a famous Hollywood family.
   The 30-year-old Goldwyn also has a level-headed sense of self in
a business where sudden success, unreality and hyperbole rule the
day.
   ``I realize acting is a profession and I want to be in it for
the rest of my life,' he says. ``A lot of the roles I was offered
after `Ghost' were one-dimensional bad guys. I thought it was
better to make noise quietly and do something I believe in.''
   Consider his latest project. Despite his current big Hollywood
flick, Goldwyn is toiling these days for minimum wages in a small
off-Broadway theater in Greenwich Village. He's co-starring with
Richard Venture in ``The Sum of Us,'' a comedy by Australian
playwright David Stevens, author of ``Breaker Morant.''
   ``It's a beautiful play which I first did at Williamstown,''
Goldwyn says.
   Set in a blue-collar suburb of Melbourne, ``The Sum of Us''
concerns the complex relationship between a son who is gay and a
father who accepts him for what he is.
   ``What I think is most interesting about the play is that David
Stevens examines a relationship that is completely unconditional
and non-judgmental and the problems that that can create,'' he
says.
   Goldwyn began his career while at Brandeis University - on
stage. It was a conscious effort to distance himself from an
impeccable show-business pedigree that he says could close as many
doors as it could open.
   One grandfather was movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, the man behind
such classics as ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' and ``Wuthering
Heights.'' The other was Broadway playwright Sidney Howard, author
of ``They Knew What They Wanted'' and ``The Silver Cord.''
   Mom is one-time stage actress Jennifer Howard. Dad is Samuel
Goldwyn Jr., a force in today's Hollywood as producer of such
recent film hits as ``Mystic Pizza.''
   Their son takes his family's celluloid celebrity in stride.
They, in turn, protected him from it.
   ``I felt naive when I finally got into show business,'' Goldwyn
says. ``I felt I didn't know anything about the movies because I
had been so sheltered from it as a kid.
   `` I was very close to my grandparents and parents but they were
so sensitive to the negative aspects of the Hollywood world that
they kept us completely separated from it. I was never involved in
my father's work.
   ``There never were movie stars around. Kids in school used to
ask me, `What movie stars do you know?' and I was embarrassed
because I didn't know any.''
   Goldwyn's decision to become an actor was greeted with mixed
feelings by his parents.
   ``My mother's whole family was from the theater and she had been
an actress in New York as a younger woman,'' Goldwyn recalls. ``So
the theater held great romance for her. She thought it was great.''
   ``My father was terrified, but he said, `Do what you want to
do,' '' Goldwyn says. ``But he was nervous about it.''
   Father and son have not worked together - at least not yet.
   ``Our relationship is primarily personal and I wouldn't want to
threaten it by getting into business together,'' Goldwyn says. ``We
have such a good solid relationship as a father and a son that it's
not worth it to either of us to muck it up.''
   Goldwyn found out about the role in ``Ghost'' through his wife,
Jane Musky, who was production designer on the film. But director
Jerry Zucker thought he was ``too nice and sympathetic'' to play
the man who tries to come between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore.
   Only after the producer and the scriptwriter saw an audition
tape Goldwyn made - and raved about his performance - did Zucker
consider him for the job.
   Goldwyn and his wife live with their new daughter, Anna, in
Hoboken, N.J.
   ``I have avoided the whole Hollywood scene, largely because it
doesn't appeal to me,'' he says. ```When I first went back to
California to work in television, it was rough. I didn't know
anybody. And yet people thought I did, so that made it even harder.
   ``I'd walk into an office and they would say `Oh, I know your
Dad.' So their perspective is `Oh, this is just another kid from a
show-business family who thinks he wants to be an actor.' I don't
want that to be the focus of things.''
   ``Ghost'' has changed that. After he finishes his run in ``The
Sum of Us,'' Goldwyn will portray Jody Powell, President Jimmy
Carter's press secretary, in a television movie for Ted Turner
about the Iran hostage crisis.
   ``The bottom line is that it's a struggle for anyone to be an
actor,'' he says. ``Now that `Ghost' has become a success, the
family connection has taken on a whole new meaning. People think it
is wonderful and say `Gee, isn't it amazing that you've made your
mark?' and `Now another Goldwyn does his own thing.' And that has
been great.''

<TEXT>
   Harry's the sort of guy, as his best friend's son says, you feel
like taking out into the woods and leaving under a rock. That's
probably being too kind.
   Harry Mention (Danny Glover) is a charming hustler whose very
presence spells danger in Charles Burnett's ``To Sleep With
Anger.'' After many years, he suddenly appears at the Los Angeles
home of his old friend from the South, Gideon, and his family,
stirring their passions, tampering with their dreams and fears,
worsening their conflicts.
   Gideon (Paul Butler) and his wife, Suzie (Mary Alice), are
godfearing people who believe in the inherent goodness of others.
They're raised two sons, Junior, responsible and committed to his
parents, pregnant wife and daughter, and Babe Brother, selfish,
insecure, irresponsible and indifferent toward his wife, Linda.
   But the clash is more than merely generational. It's also
lifestyle. Linda (Sheryl Lee Ralph) and Babe Brother (Richard
Brooks) are selfish yuppies who leave their son with his
grandparents each day and sometimes don't pick him up until
midnight. During family gatherings, Linda prefers staying outside
in the ca instead of joining in, because, she says, she doesn't
know anything about crops or how to get rid of garden pests.
   The chasm between Babe and Linda and Babe's parents is like a
lake filled with hot lava. And with Harry on the scene, it's about
to boil over.
   Harry insinuates himself into the very fragile family
relationship, seducing Babe to his misogynist, selfish and
neo-criminal ways and almost possessing him until the family
barrels into a near-tragedy.
   Burnett blocks ``To Sleep With Anger,'' which he also wrote,
like a well-staged three-act play, and his denouement is delicious
and devilish. His action is understated, a poetic sweep rather than
a frenzied dance. This is his first major feature film. His other
works have included ``Killer of Sheep,'' ``My Brother's Wedding''
and ``Horse.'' His is an original vision.
   His ensemble cast is balanced and works well. Alice is always a
gentle joy, and Glover continues to astound with his range from his
hip keystone cop capers with Mel Gibson to his lyrical boarder in
``Places in the Heart.'' There's good support from Ralph, Butler,
Carl Lumbly as the older son and Vonetta McGee as his wife.
   ``To Sleep With Anger'' made its debut at the New York Film
Festival, and is being released by The Samuel Goldwyn Co.
   Produced by Caldecot Chubb, Thomas S. Byrnes and Darin Scott,
with Edward R. Pressman, Harris E. Tulchin and Glover as executive
producers, the movie is rated PG for adult language.

<BYLINE>``Question &amp; Answer'' (Geffen) - Pat Metheny with Dave Holland
and
Roy Haynes</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   When guitarist Pat Metheny discovered a few open dates on his
calendar last December, he hooked up with two other jazz veterans,
drummer Roy Haynes and bassist Dave Holland, and headed for the
studio.
   Their goal was a good time, rather than a record. But when
Metheny played back the tapes of their eight-hour session, he liked
what he heard and decided to release some of the music as
``Question &amp; Answer.''
   Sad to say, Metheny's enthusiasm was misplaced; there isn't much
to hear here. As always, he coins some nice melodies and then takes
them in interesting directions. The lovely, reflective ``Change of
Heart'' is comparable to his best work.
   But while Metheny is often spinning intricate sounds, his rhythm
section detracts and distracts. Haynes, always a busy drummer, is
annoying with his incessant cymbals - it's as though he was being
paid by the ching. Holland's bass is undermixed and mumbles most of
the time, especially on the fast tunes and when he solos.
   Another reason the 62-minute record seems longer is that it's
dynamically flat. As Metheny points out in the liner notes, he
played one guitar at one setting throughout. His synclavier on the
closing ``Three Flights Up'' provides the record's only change in
texture.
   Metheny has released only two other trio albums, so his fans may
regard ``Question &amp; Answer'' as a treat. But it's not for the
faint-hearted.

<HEAD>``Lovers Who Wander'' (Enigma) - Del Lords</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   What's America's best unknown rock band? Here's a vote for New
York City's finest, the Del Lords.
   The Del Lords' music - little tales of life and redemption with
three guitars and drums - seems almost quaint today. But it's done
with intelligence and dedication, all the more impressive since
they've never achieved the stardom some predicted for them six
years ago.
   This is a quartet of working-class New Yorkers who haven't lost
their pride in the city despite anger at what's become of it.
``Somewhere in Queens,'' Scott Kempner sings, ``The sun is always
shining.''
   But enough sociology. ``Lovers Who Wander'' is a collection that
illuminates common life, from a landlord who sues a tenant for
being ``a day late and a dollar short,'' to, of course, lovers who
wander. The Del Lords never quite give in to their frustrations,
and one suspects it's largely due to the healing powers of music.
   Most of Kempner's songs depict various stages of relationships,
from the anticipation of ``I Need Love'' to the resignation of
``Learn to Let Go.'' While the Del Lords retain their musical
toughness, the material here demands more subtlety than the band
has shown in the past, and they handle it with aplomb.
   The only wish here is that Kempner loosen the reins on his band.
Only twice does he let someone else write the songs and one of
them, ``Rockabye,'' - written and sung by drummer Frank Funaro - is
terrific. Guitarist Eric Ambel's voice, enough to carry a strong
solo album a year ago, isn't heard until the final song. Kempner
wrings as much emotion from his gruff Bronx-accented voice as can
be expected, but he'd be better off spreading the vocals around
more.
   Much of rock 'n' roll is fantasy-based, but the Del Lords have
both feet firmly on the ground. And their victories are also their
listeners'. Call it music you can use.

<HEAD>On Show: Bridgestone Collection Brings Masterworks to Nashville</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICKI BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans will get a rare glimpse of how
one Japanese art collector viewed Western art when a collection of
60 impressionist and modern paintings goes on exhibit next Sunday.
   Shojiro Ishibasi, founder of Bridgestone, the world's third
largest tire manufacturer, began collecting artwork before World
War II. Only once before has any part of the collection left Tokyo,
and that was in 1962 when works traveled to Paris.
   Bridgestone has two tire plants in Tennessee and had its
American headquarters in the state until it merged with Firestone
and moved to Arkon, Ohio.
   ``Masterworks: Paintings From the Bridgestone Collection'' will
hang in the Tennessee State Museum through Jan. 20. The exhibit
features works by nearly every major painter of the impressionist
school and includes Claude Monet's ``Twilight (Venice)'' and Amedeo
Modigliani's ``Portrait of a Young Farmer.''
   ``It's one Japanese collector's view of Western art,'' Tennessee
State Museum Curator Lois Riggins Ezell said. ``Some did not paint
in the impressionist style, but they all began painting in that
time period and were all influenced by the school of
impressionism.''
   The museum has booked tours from New York and the Midwest, since
Bridgestone probably will not let the exhibit travel again, Ezell
said.
   Highlights include well-known paintings, such as ``Water
Lilies'' from the later works of Monet and the outstanding ``Mont
Saint-Victoire and Chateau Noir'' by Paul Cezanne.
   ``Cezanne spent half of his life painting his mountain and this
is one of the best,'' Ezell said.
   Works by Henri Rousseau, Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse provide
a look at impressionism moving into Modernism.
   The collection also includes modern paintings such as Pablo
Picasso's ``Cup and Spoon'' and Giorgio de Chirico's
``Troubadour.''
   ``Cup and Spoon'' is a still life in cubist style, while
``Troubadour'' is a painting of a mannequin, one of the types of
work for which Chirico is best known.
   The 60 paintings were selected primarily by the curators of the
Tokyo museum, as the most artistically significant and the most
stable, Ezell said. Paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec and Chagall were
considered two fragile for shipment. And work by Rembrandt van Rijn
was painted on a board, which lacks the resiliency of canvas and
does not travel well.
   The collection will be on display through Jan. 20, 1991 and will
then return to Japan.

<TEXT>
   There was nothing special about Elizabeth
Perkins as a child, unless you consider staring at people in
restaurants, hopping freight trains and cheating on Rorschach tests
to be nothing special.
   Her career in films has been, so far, nothing special. She
started off in 1986 with a hit, ``About Last Night ... '' and then
appeared in a pair of flops, ``Sweethearts Dance'' and ``From the
Hip.'' Playing Tom Hanks' girlfriend in ``Big'' earned her solid
reviews and the offers started pouring in - for Hanks.
   ``It's like death out there,'' Perkins, 29, said during a recent
interview at a Manhattan hotel.
   ``There are no parts for actresses; they just don't exist.
Where's Jessica Lange? Where's Jane Fonda? Why did Meryl Streep
make `She-Devil'? I just happened to be the actress in `Big' so I
got a few offers. I got offers to play uptight actresses with a
heart of gold, just like my part in `Big.' ''
   She was willing to beg for ``Big'' and nearly two years later
felt the same way about her latest movie, ``Avalon.''
   The actress had become friendly with director Barry Levinson
while he was making the Academy Award-winning ``Rain Man.'' When
casting began for ``Avalon,'' he offered her the role as the mother
of a family growing up in Levinson's native Baltimore during the
1940s and '50s.
   Perkins didn't need to finish the script.
   ``It was so brilliantly written,'' she said. ``I got about half
way through before I called. I would have played a waitress if he
had asked me to. I would have brought in coffee in a scene.
   ``He said I had the cynicism and I had the banter down. He said
I looked like a woman from the 1940s. He said I had a very period
face. I don't think I have a contemporary face.''
   Perkins was born in Queens, N.Y., but her parents divorced when
she was a baby and she lived on a 600-acre farm in Brattleboro,
Vt., with her mother and stepfather.
   Basic acting and basic insubordination were her specialties.
Drama awards, faulty attendance and expulsion from a boarding
school are among her childhood memories. Under parental supervision
she was liable to gaze at strangers. Free to do what she pleased,
Perkins supplied erotic answers for her Rorschachs (inkblot
analyses for personality testing) - ``just for shock value'' - and
tested her jumping skills on moving trains.
   ``That was a big thing in my town,'' she recalled. ``Ride it,
and then hop off. How can a kid really do anything that bad. The
things they kick you out of school for. When you get to be older,
you realize that wasn't so bad. Stealing food from the dining hall,
skipping school, smoking a joint - they're part of growing up.''
   After boarding school, Perkins lived with her father in Chicago
and then spent three years training at the Goodman Theater School.
Two years of looking for work convinced her to move to New York
(this time, she paid for transportation) where she eventually
landed a part on Broadway in Neil Simon's ``Brighton Beach
Memoirs.''
   Acting in films is easy, she insists, just a matter of summing
up a character in a few words or images. For ``Avalon,'' Perkins
played the part ``worried,'' seeing herself as a woman whose family
was slowly breaking up. In ``Big,'' she relied on a visual effect.
   ``One of the things I did was to slowly lower the height of my
shoes for the entire movie, so by the end my feet were completely
flat on the ground. That for me gave a physical aspect to the role.
I started out the movie in 4-inch high heels and I ended it flat.
   ``I started with my hair up and eventually lowered it and
lowered it until it completely went down. Hanks brings her back
down to earth. He brings the real her out.''
   But fans seem to confuse the ``real'' Perkins with someone else.
No one seems to realize they've encountered a genuine train-hopper.
That's why cynicism and banter come easily for her, especially when
greetings alternate between, ``Weren't you Tom Hanks' girlfriend in
`Big'? '' and, ``Aren't you Elizabeth McGovern?''
   ``The first time we met each other was about a year and a half
ago at an audition,'' she said of McGovern, another dark-haired
actress with a face for period pieces (``Ragtime,'' ``Once Upon a
Time in America'').
   ``We were sitting and she turns to me and says, `Do people
confuse you with me as much they confuse me with you?' I said
`Yes!' She said, `At least you're talented.' And I said, `Yeah, at
least you're talented. It's not like you're a bimbo.''

<HEAD>The Artists: The ``Flower Painter'' Stigma</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florence Harrison Nesbit has spent 60 years
trying to shake the image of a ``lady flower painter.''
   At 80, Nesbit still slips on a smock for ``painting binges'' at
her studio in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood. She creates amid a
stack of canvasses that includes watercolors of Whidbey Island and
Walla Walla and scenes of her old sun porch in Berkeley, Calif.
   A shoebox of note cards keeps track of a lifetime of paintings.
Some are sold. Some are displayed at Seattle's Bayview Manor where
the artist lives. Many are forgotten.
   A Port Angeles gallery manager recently scouted Nesbit for a
showing of her work. ``Are you just a flower painter?'' he asked
skeptically. She bristled at the remark.
   ``It's a stigma you can't get rid of,'' Nesbit said. ``We want
to paint just as badly as men do - most of us have had the same
training as men had. But we have an awful time finding a place to
show.''
   Seattle gallery owners David Martin and Dominic Zambito want to
change all that.
   This month, the Martin-Zambito Fine Art gallery on Capitol Hill
is mounting an exhibition of paintings by Northwest women to
commemorate the 60th anniversary of The Women Painters of
Washington.
   The show will display works primarily from the 1930s, '40s and
'50s by Nesbit and more than a dozen other members of the women's
painting group. Only five of the artists featured are still alive.
   Relegated to family archives or sometimes destroyed altogether,
art from this generation of Northwest women has not been easy to
assemble, Martin said. He's rounded up works from families, friends
and some of the painters themselves. A few paintings were picked up
at New England auction houses.
   While critics continue to praise the vision of Northwestern
painters Mark Tobey, Kenneth Callahan and Morris Graves, lesser
known painters have been lost in history, Martin said. This show,
he said, attempts to give Northwest women artists the recognition
they deserve.
   ``It just seems unbalanced,'' Martin said. ``They are as
talented as their male counterparts who showed in museums and
gallery retrospectives. I want people to come and see their artwork
because it's very good.''
   The exhibition is a travelogue of Washington state countrysides
and cityscapes. Paintings are priced from the high hundreds to
$6,500.
   Dorothy Milne Rising offers 1940s scenes of the Puyallup Fair
and Seattle's Pike Place Market. Rising, 95, currently lives in
Mukilteo.
   Cle Elum's oldest homestead from the 1930s is portrayed by Olive
Malestrom Carl. There are paintings of Mount Shuksan by Elizabeth
Warhanik and Eastern Washington haystacks by Dorothy Dolph Jensen,
two founders of The Women Painters of Washington.
   The exhibit also includes an 80-year-old photograph by Myra
Wiggins, another co-founder. One of the ``photo secessionists,''
Wiggins participated in a landmark photography exhibition with
Alfred Stieglitz in New York in 1910. A picture from that show will
be on display at the Pike Street gallery.
   Perhaps the best known artist featured is Yvonne Twining Humber,
82, of Seattle. A painter for the Works Progress Administration
(WPA) in Boston in the 1930s, Humber sells more art work in New
England than the Pacific Northwest, Martin said. But the strength
of her painting is apparent in an ethereal depiction of the
``Cascades at Night'' and her lively carnival scenes. Her work will
be exhibited in a one-woman show this December at the
Martin-Zambito gallery.
   ``The circus fascinated me,'' said Humber at her home in the
city's Magnolia neighborhood. ``Old circuses would have a tent with
elephants wandering around. It was the informality. There was loads
of life.''
   A Northwest resident since the 1940s, Humber said she has never
been a flower painter. Job opportunities, not sexual politics,
directed her vision, and she said her early experience with the WPA
was influential.
   ``I paint buildings with better composition than I do fuzzy
little trees,'' the artist explained. ``It was just circumstance
that pushed me in that direction, but I loved it.''
   Humber says she experienced no discrimination as a woman
painter, but regrets her sex-segregated art training at the
National Academy of Design in New York.
   Female-only classes, however, were better than no school at all.
   After a divorce in 1967, Nesbit applied to the fine arts program
at her alma mater, the University of Washington. She hoped to earn
a master's degree after completing one year of studies at Scripps
College in California. But she was turned down by the program
director, an old college classmate, who flatly told her that UW was
not enrolling women painters.
   ``In those days before women's lib, we didn't think about it -
we just took it,'' Nesbit recalled. ``I almost gave up painting and
that was my life.''
   Nesbit was an early success, placing first in watercolor in 1933
at the Seattle Art Museum's Northwest annual exhibition. In the
decades that followed she won several painting awards and exhibited
at a number of one-woman shows in California and Seattle's Frye Art
Museum.
   Employed as a WPA painting teacher in the 1930s, Nesbit later
got a job drawing fashion figures for newspaper advertisements. She
co-founded the Northwest Watercolor Society in 1940.
   When she can, Nesbit still takes to the outdoors to paint live
landscapes. But with age confining her more to the art studio, she
has begun experimenting with new techniques such as tilt-top
painting.
   Like other talented women artists of her generation, Nesbit
followed her passion, but was rarely encouraged to take it
seriously. After six decades of perfecting her art, she still
stumbles in labeling herself a professional painter.
   ``My sister worked at Boeing for 27 years and that was
considered successful. I was just a painter messing around,''
Nesbit said.
   ``Financially, I couldn't exist from what I make from my
painting. Emotionally, I couldn't have lived without it.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: INXS Heads Back to Roots To Kick Off World Tour</HEAD>

   When members of the rock group INXS hit the
road this month for a yearlong world tour, they wanted to kick it
off where the band had its humble beginnings - the Australian pub.
   ``We're playing up in Queensland and places like that up in the
north. Places that really don't get to see us that often, little
towns you know,'' says Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the
sextet.
   ``We could obviously do much bigger shows in Australia,'' says
guitarist and keyboardist Andrew Farriss. ``But we feel it's a good
way to start off the tour because it's grounding for us.''
   The tour promoting their newly released ``X'' album will wind
around the globe through Southeast Asia and Europe, reaching North
America sometime in January. The first single from the album,
``Suicide Blond,'' is already scurrying up the charts.
   The song's title has spurred some confusion among listeners who
wonder just what a suicide blond is. Hutchence explains that it's
simply a term that was used in the 1940s for a shade of hair dye.
   ``It was hard times, everyone used to dye their hair with
peroxide in the sink at home, so it was dyed by their own hands,''
Hutchence says. ``I thought that was an interesting case of
semantics going on ... so I turned it into the song. It's actually
much more positive than it sounds. It's not about suicide.''
   ``X,'' with the bulk of the songs written by Hutchence and
Farriss, is reminiscent of the rawness INXS has produced in
previous albums - rhythmic rock mixed with a dab of funk. ``We're a
hybrid, you know,'' Hutchence says proudly.
   And as the band's main songwriters, Hutchence, 30, and Farriss,
31, take their jobs seriously.
   ``You've got to move to music or music has to move you, or you
shouldn't do it, in my opinion,'' says Farriss. ``You've got to be
interested and want to move something around whether it's people's
emotions, interest or loins or something of that nature.''
   ``But we don't write something purely to dance to; there's a
sense of rhythm, there's a sense of life,'' adds Hutchence.
   He warns that if you get too introverted in your approach to
songwriting, you can ``get wigged out in sad, miserable tales.''
   Rounding out INXS are Farriss' brothers, Jon and Tim, Kirk
Pengilly and Garry Gary Beers. They began as a band out of Sydney
called The Farriss Brothers in 1977, while most members were still
in high school.
   They toured the Australian pub circuit, developing a huge
following. The guys credit those pub days with giving them the
power to negotiate contracts with record companies without
compromising their own visions for the band.
   ``We were signed because we had created something already, we
weren't made into anything and that's the way we've always run
it,'' Hutchence says. ``No one has ever, ever run me and said to me
or Andrew you better do this or do that. No one's ever told us to
do anything.''
   The band debuted in the United States in 1983 with the release
of the single, ``The One Thing.'' But it was the 1985
multi-platinum album, ``Listen Like Thieves,'' that catapulted the
group to widespread fame.
   The single from that album, ``What You Need,'' became the band's
first Top 10 hit in the United States. Their next album, ``Kick,''
released in 1987, had the hits ``Need You Tonight,'' ``Devil
Inside,'' ``New Sensation'' and ``Never Tear Us Apart.''
   The band took a break after that album and follow-up tour. Some
members spent the hiatus producing other acts and creating new
bands.
   Hutchence, whose charismatic stage presence has been compared to
the late Jim Morrison of ``The Doors,'' transformed his talents to
the movie screen.
   He plays a small part in the yet-to-be released Roger Corman
film, ``Frankenstein Unbound,'' starring John Hurt and Raul Julia.
He also got raves for his first feature role in the 1986 Australian
film ``Dogs in Space.''
   ``I love films, I'm a real fan of films, I guess I aspire to
that,'' says Hutchence, the only band member who makes his home
outside of Australia. He resides in Hong Kong, where his British
military father was stationed during part of his childhood.
   Hutchence also used the hiatus to put together ``Max Q,'' a
group that garnered critical, but not popular, acclaim for its sole
album.
   ``I thought it was going to be bigger than `Thriller,' it was
going to be `Killer,' '' he jokes, referring to Michael Jackson's
mega-hit album.
   The title of the latest album reflects the band's attitude
toward simplicity.
   ``We didn't want something too wordy like `The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,' '' says Farriss. ``We just wanted something
simple. So it stands for whatever you want to make of it.''
   The ``X'' could stand for the Roman numeral 10, signifying the
10th anniversary of the band's first album, ``INXS,'' or it could
be a mocking jab at the music rating controversy, Hutchence
suggests, although their own material does not push decency limits.
   The band members' belief in simplicity carries over to their
attitude about live performances, which they say will be reflected
in the tour.
   ``Our shows are more traditional,'' Hutchence says. ``We spend a
lot of money on sound equipment and stage equipment. It'll look
good, but really it's just a band playing and I think people
appreciate that.
   ``We're not clowns. It's real.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Photographic Journey to Mississippi Delta's
Juke Joints</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though old ones close and new ones open, the juke
joints of the Mississippi Delta persist, unique, individual,
apparently oblivious of franchise America.
   These roadhouses - with such names as Magic City, Monkey's Place
and the Out of Sight Club - appear all along the fertile basin of
the river. The settings are rural, the clientele black.
   What they have in common are music, a jukebox usually, beer or
harder stuff, and their regulars, the same faces this week as last.
   For most of America, these elemental pieces of the Delta puzzle
are, if anything, ``another world ... in the midst of my own,'' as
photographer Birney Imes says in a new book that collects his
evocative pictures of the juke joints.
   Imes, a white Southerner whose work appears in the Museum of
Modern Art, was referring generally to black culture, which he said
he was ``only vaguely aware of'' before attending an integrated
high school in the 1960s.
   ``When I began photographing six or seven years later,'' he
adds, ``it was in part my wish and my need to overcome this
ignorance that helped make my choice of subject an obvious one.''
   Beginning by photographing people and scenes in rural
Mississippi, he eventually came to see the juke joints as subjects.
The result is ``Juke Joint'' (University Press of Mississippi,
$39.95).
   The collection of 61 color photographs provides outsiders with a
tantalizing look into these clubs, which beckon and forbid when one
passes them on a country road. Their strings of year-round
Christmas bulbs give off firefly light, their doors may open
momentarily to release a yellow glow and a thudding, bluesy beat.
   It's the photos' ``capacity ... to be other than cultural
snapshots'' that novelist Richard Ford appreciates. The
Mississippian, author of ``The Sportswriter,'' analyzes the
pictures' uncanny art in an introductory essay.
   Still, the peek in the jukes' door, the view of these private
places that the pictures offer, is an undeniable part of the book's
value.
   That's partly because in some cases the places depicted no
longer exist. Beyond that, details in the corners of photographs
help flesh out the lives of the mostly unseen juke joint patrons.
   Signs on the wall, often handwritten, reflect the local sense of
humor or the approach here to problems seen everywhere. ``O Lord,
Please help me keep my damn nose out of other people's business,''
says one sign, and next to it: ``No Dope. Please. Crack will kill
you. Look at your buddy. He's dead, you no.''
   In the homely decorations of many clubs that Imes portrays any
reader quickly glimpses the notorious poverty of the region, as
well as its legendary creativity.
   Some photos focus closely on brightly spraypainted interiors or
homemade furniture. On a cracked wall of the Riverside Lounge in
Shaw, Miss., somebody painted a large, floating bull in a style
that strangely recalls the art of the cave paintings of France and
Spain.
   ``What I see in Imes' photographs does not equal the human
condition,'' Ford writes, ``only a human condition, a miniature
advanced as art and meant to ease the adjustments between ourselves
and the world by offering beauty, consolation, diversion, the
satisfaction of direct address - all the usual enticements by which
art dignifies and pleases us.''
   It's risky to suggest where art originates, but part of what
compells a reader to these pictures of places that are anything but
glamorous comes from the light the photographer captures. In one
photograph, a golden sunrise or sunset light bathes the torn
tarpaper wall of the Pink Pony Cafe in Darling, Miss., and makes
shadows, all in profile, of a line of people just outside the
frame.
   The simultaneous presence and absence of people in many of the
photos is another reflection of Imes' art. Some interior shots were
exposed and printed so that furnishings, such as a pool table,
appear in sharp focus while patrons, such as moving pool players,
appear as blurs, almost as ghosts.
   No one is seen in a claustrophobic shot of a band's instruments,
speakers, amplifiers and even drink glasses, but the reader almost
hears the din of conversation between sets.
   Here and elsewhere in this collection ``the unknown,'' as Ford
says, ``seems to have been put to use.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Matraca Berg a Feisty Newcomer</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Matraca Berg is a feisty and
defiant newcomer who slays the country music axiom ``stand by your
man.''
   In her well-crafted debut album, the 26-year-old firebrand
ridicules her real-life ex-husband in ``The Things You Left
Undone.''
   In another autobiographical tune, ``Appalachian Rain,'' her
real-life father, who helped conceive her without marrying her
mother and then abandoned mother and child, is shot by her family.
Berg says the song is true except for the shooting, which she
describes as ``wishful thinking.''
   The album is ``Lying to the Moon,'' a collection of rebellious
country rockers and thoughtful ballads written by a woman, sung by
a woman and definitely about women.
   So what does she put into her music?
   ``My heart and my soul,'' she said in an interview. ``That's
exactly what I put into every song I write. And honesty.''
   In the album, she repeatedly tells men ``goodbye,'' ``I don't
love you'' and ``I can make it on my own.''
   There's little acknowledgement of country queen Tammy Wynette's
viewpoint in ``Stand by Your Man'' more than 20 years ago.
   The first single released from the album, ``Baby Walk On,'' is a
rollicking tune asserting that a woman doesn't mind if her lover
leaves the relationship.
   ``I Must Have Been Crazy'' is an up-tempo tune questioning why
she loved someone.
   ``Lying to the Moon'' is a soft ballad about the pain from a
misleading lover. It was written on the porch of a mountaintop
cabin as she watched the moon rise and the mist form.
   Her songs are laden with romantic themes, drawn heavily from her
personal life.
   ``I think we all go through trials and tribulations in love
affairs,'' she said. ``I just happen to be writing about them. The
songs are directed at a couple of guys in my life and not at men in
general.
   ``I'm a reporter as a songwriter. I observe what other people go
through and what I go through and I report it in the best way
possible with the most empathy I can feel in the most undiluted
fashion I can.''
   Berg, whose first name is pronounced Muh-tray'-suh, has been
writing hit songs since age 18 when she penned ``Faking Love,''
which was recorded by country singers T.G. Sheppard and Karen
Brooks. She also wrote ``The Last One to Know,'' a No. 1 hit by
country star Reba McEntire.
   She's been singing all along, with stops along the way with a
Louisiana-based rock 'n' roll band and a spot in the movie ``Made
in Heaven,'' in which she is discovered singing by actor Timothy
Hutton.
   Berg, the daughter of the late Nashville recording session
singer-songwriter Icee Berg, also sang with rock veteran Neil Young
at the LiveAid concert in Philadelphia and other concerts.
   On ``Lying to the Moon,'' she enlisted and received the help of
veteran singer Emmylou Harris, who provides backup vocals.
   ``She's pretty accessible, especially to young, new talent,''
Berg said. ``She contributed to making my year. She's a hero of
mine so this was a high point in my career.''
   Her mother, who died of cancer six years ago, never got to hear
the folk-sounding song about her out-of-wedlock child and the
fictional fate that befell the father. Berg said she'd be proud.
   ``I grew up realizing I was born an illegitimate child. My
mother just never made a big deal about it. It's not such a no-no
to me as maybe it would seem to other people,'' she said.
   ``My mother went through a lot of hard times back in the early
'60s when this happened. I think it's a beautiful story worth
writing about.''
   She jests that ``The Things You Left Undone'' could be subtitled
``Ode to My Ex-Husband.'' He is a songwriter. The couple divorced
last year after two years of marriage.
   ``It's a tongue-in-cheek kind of song. I dedicated it to him one
night at a show. We are friends; we just couldn't live together. He
owns his part of the bad deal and I own my part and we go on with
it. He likes the song.''
   Berg believes women are more enlightened than they were a
generation ago and will welcome the viewpoint in her lyrics.
   ``Women are working now so their livelihood doesn't depend on
this person that they are married to. So I think they tend to think
more of themselves as a separate entity than they used to,'' she
said.
   ``They are tougher in a lot of ways, so they stand up for
themselves a lot more.''

   America's unemployment rate worsened for the
third straight month in September, the government said.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilian jobless
rate rose to 5.7 percent last month.
   Coupled with unemployment rises in July and August, marked the
first time since the 1981-82 recession that the jobless rate has
increased three months in a row, the government said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Democratic leaders predicted that a new budget
agreement easing Medicare cuts and tempering excise tax increases
will be reached before the government shutdown takes full effect
Tuesday.
   Democrats told their leaders Sunday to go ahead with a plan
designed to let Democratic-controlled committees draft later the
specifics for reaching $500 billion in deficit reduction over the
next five years.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - The failed federal budget accord slammed stock
and bond prices but the markets recovered nearly all the lost
ground, partly on President Bush's tough stance against Congress.
   In a lengthy night session, a rebellious House early Friday
overwhelmingly defeated the $500-billion compromise package of tax
increases and spending cuts sought by Bush and congressional
leaders.
   Wall Street professionals had hoped for a budget accord to help
reduce the amount of borrowing needed to pay the federal deficit
and spur the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates.

   CHICAGO (AP) - The employee group trying to buy UAL Corp., the
parent company of United Airlines, said that $2 billion in bank
financing for its bid on Tuesday has fallen through.
   But the group will make a bid anyway, using a combination of
cash and equity from other sources, Gerald Greenwald, chief
executive officer of the United Employee Acquisition Corp. said
Sunday
   He said substitute financing would come from company suppliers;
sale-leaseback arrangements, in which the company sells equipment
such as airplanes and leases them back; employee investments; and
cash on hand.

   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) - The United Auto Workers union and Ford
Motor Co. reached a tentative national labor contract that closely
follows a pattern agreement reached three weeks ago with General
Motors Corp.
   Officials from the UAW and Ford said Sunday the tentative
three-year agreement mirrored the contract reached Sept. 17 with GM
and ratified a week ago by GM workers. But there were a few
exceptions, including the maintenance of a two-week shutdown at
Ford in July.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Charles Keating said he is innocent of a
42-count criminal indictment alleging fraud in junk bond sales
through his failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   Keating and three co-defendants entered innocent pleas Friday to
an array of charges accusing them of bilking investors in American
Continental Corp. junk bonds sold through Lincoln branches.
   Keating, who has been unable to post $5 million bail, was then
returned to jail.

   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Travelers Corp. said it is adding
$650 million to its reserves to cover expected real estate losses,
a move that will result in a third-quarter net loss of $500
million.
   The insurance company also said Friday it will reduce its
quarterly dividend to 40 cents a share from 60 cents.
   The company said it was the first major addition to reserves
since June 1988, when Travelers added $415 million to cover
anticipated real estate losses. The latest increase boosts reserves
to $1.15 billion at quarter's end.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) - Trans World Airlines Inc. sent layoff notices
to 430 employees to cut its losses further in an industry hit hard
by rising fuel prices and the slumping economy.
   A TWA spokesman said Frida that more layoffs, and possibly
flight reductions, could come later. TWA, which has its hub in St.
Louis, has about 33,000 employees worldwide.
   The spokesman said the layoffs were related to higher jet fuel
prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. USAir Group Inc., Pan
Am Corp. and Midway Airlines Inc. also have announced layoffs.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve policy-makers decided two
weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to keep interest rates
unchanged but to permit lower rates if economic conditions
warranted, newly released records show.
   Short-term interest rates, which the Fed has used for two years
in combatting inflation, did not change after the Aug. 21 meeting
of the Federal Open Market Committee. They have remained at 8
percent since mid-summer. The Fed records were released Friday.
   ---
   LONDON (AP) - Dropping long-standing resistance, the government
said it will link the pound to Europe's exchange rate mechanism, a
move expected to help Britain's fight against inflation.
   The move Friday symbolized British willingness to participate in
European integration, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher stressed
her continued opposition to creating a single European bank and a
single currency.

   Stock prices fell Friday, but the market managed to minimize the
damage from an early sell-off that followed the rejection of a
government budget plan. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped
6.19 to 2,510.64, reducing its gain for the week to 58.16 points.
   The dollar rose against most major currencies. Gold gained
modestly.
   Bonds were little changed.
   Pork belly futures prices aimed for near-record prices;
livestock futures and soybeans were mixed; wheat gained and corn
was lower; and energy futures rose.

   Geoffrey Moore is a referee who's not looking
forward to his next call. He could blow the whistle on the longest
economic expansion in U.S. peacetime history.
   Moore and six colleagues affiliated with the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., will decide - perhaps before
year's end - on whether the latest recession has begun.
   Many private economists believe a downturn is imminent - if it
is not already here. And Moore said he expects his committee to
decide before December whether the next downturn is under way.
   The current growth cycle, which would be eight years old in
November, already has broken the previous peacetime record of 58
months, from March 1975 to January 1980. The all-time record of 106
months of economic growth ran from February 1961 to December 1969,
a time period that included the Vietnam War.
   The last recession lasted from July 1981 to November 1982,
according to Moore and his colleagues on the bureau's Business
Cycle Dating Committee. The next would be the eighth that Moore has
been involved in defining.
   ``I don't look forward to recessions,'' he says. ``I just try to
identify them after they've started.''
   The bureau, a private research organization of several hundred
academic economists scattered around the world, has become
recognized as the arbiter of business cycles. Founded in 1920, it
is funded by corporate contributions and government and foundation
grants.
   Its tables showing the extent of business growth and contraction
since 1854 have been published regularly in Commerce Department
publications beginning in 1961.
   ``That's what has made it `official,' more than anything else,
that a government agency would use its data,'' Moore said in a
recent interview.
   He retired from the bureau staff in 1979 after 40 years to
become director of the Center for International Business Cycle
Research at Columbia University - a position he still holds at age
76. However, he still is affiliated with NBER.
   ``Their calls are widely accepted,'' said Adren Cooper, a
Commerce Department spokesman. ``Since the NBER has been doing that
... there's been no controversy that I know of.''
   The government itself does not announce the beginning and end of
business cycles out of fear that it would be accused of making
politically manipulated decisions.
   The NBER definition of a recession is more complicated than the
often-used formula of two consecutive quarterly declines in the
gross national product - the broadest measure of the nation's
economic activity. That was coined by Arthur Okun, chairman of
President Lyndon Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers.
   The NBER's broader definition is ``a recurring period of decline
in total output, income, employment and trade, usually lasting from
six months to a year and marked by widespread contractions in many
sectors of the economy,'' bureau spokeswoman Donna Zeritz said.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan also uses a more complex
definition of a recession.
   A recession is ``a cumulative process of deterioration in which
events feed on each other,'' causing a major economic decline, he
told Congress last month. ``A process in which the economy is
deteriorating in a cumulative, interactive manner ... is a true
recession.''
   Although Greenspan and the Bush administration contend the
economy is not now in a downturn, many private economists disagree,
saying the economy began contracting during the current quarter.
Others say a recession is likely before year's end.
   Moore describes the criteria for measuring a recession as ``the
3-D words: duration, depth and defusion.''
   As for duration, the longest recession lasted 65 months, from
October 1873 to March 1879. The shortest lasted six months, from
January to July 1980. The Great Depression went on for 43 months,
starting in August 1929 and ending in March 1933.
   In addition to duration, Moore said, ``we look at measures of
aggregate economic activity such as non-farm employment, industrial
production, real GNP, real income and real sales.
   ``We get a variety of measures of that sort and see whether the
decline that's begun is comparable with the magnitude of previous
cycles,'' he explained.
   Defusion, Moore said, means the decline is experienced widely
and not contained in just one or two industries such as housing and
automobiles.
   Joining Moore in deciding the peaks and troughs of business
cycles are Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, the NBER
president who became economic adviser to President Reagan as the
nation was emerging from the last recession; Robert Hall, the
committee chairman from Stanford University; William Branson of
Princeton University; Benjamin Friedman of Harvard; Victor
Zarnowitz of the University of Chicago Business School; and Robert
Gordon of Northwestern University.
   The bureau also is credited with developing the Commerce
Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
forecast economic activity six months to nine months in advance.

   General Motors Corp. this week introduces its new
Saturn line into a market some say is already crowded with cars in
the $10,000-price range.
   No less than seven other manufacturers offering more than three
dozen kinds of cars, including some of the best-selling vehicles in
the United States, already are in the same ballpark as Saturn.
   ``Where does it fit in?'' said Herb Adcox, owner of Herb Adcox
Chevrolet-Geo in Chattanooga, Tenn. ``There is no shelf space.''
   Officials of Saturn Corp., a GM subsidiary established to help
show the distinction of its cars from GM's others, said they're
planning to get 80 percent of the corporation's projected annual
sales of 250,000 cars from would-be import buyers.
   Auto analysts said the goals, especially the 80-percent import
conquest rate, will be difficult to attain as foreign automakers,
especially Japanese, grab larger shares of the shrinking U.S. auto
market.
   At the end of September, Japanese automakers held about 28
percent of the U.S. car market.
   Based on price and other statistics, the four Saturn models will
be competing against three models each of the Dodge Shadow and
Plymouth Sundance, six of the Ford Tempo, six of the Honda Civic,
three of the Mazda Protege, seven of the Nissan Sentra and five of
the Toyota Corolla.
   That's in addition to two models of the Chevrolet Cavalier and
four of the Geo Prizm, both sold by Adcox and thousands of other GM
dealers. The Cavalier was the third best-selling car in the 1990
model year and Civic was at No. 10.
   ``We've got dozens (of models) in that same (Saturn) price
bracket,'' Adcox said. ``I don't know how in the world you are
going to market a $10,000 to $12,000 car.''
   Saturn's four models carry base prices between $7,995 and
$11,775, without taxes, destination charges, options or other
costs. Other cars in that price segment offer incentives, but
Saturn isn't, for now at least.
   ``It's pretty clear that by starting out at $8,000 base, they
fully intend to sell this vehicle without an incentive,'' said auto
analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York
City.
   ``The last thing you want to do is taint the vehicle or its
reputation by having to slap an incentive on the vehicle in weeks
or months or a very short period after its introduction,'' he said.
   Selling a car without an incentive in the United States these
days is a tough chore. In some cases, selling a car with an
incentive is tough, too.
   For example, sales of the Chevrolet Cavalier through the first
nine months totaled 222,980 cars, down 3.3 percent from last year.
GM's latest incentive on the car is a $900 cash rebate.
   In addition to cash, some of Saturn's main competitors are
giving away air conditioning and automatic transmissions.
   While Cavalier sales slipped, January-September sales for the
Honda Civic, which carries no incentives, were up 11 percent,
compared with last year, to 198,284 cars.
   Basically, Saturn officials are banking that their dealers'
showrooms will be flooded with people who have bought import cars
in the past, but feel guilty about shunning American manufacturers.
   Saturn wants to build a reputation quickly that its cars are
more like imports than other GM models. Saturn's first round of
advertising contains no references to it being a part of GM and the
company is requiring that Saturn dealers erect separate dealerships
for Saturn sales and service operations.
   It's the first time in 58 years that GM, the world's largest
automaker, has created a new division.
   There are more than two dozen companies selling hundreds of
kinds of cars in the United States - ranging from Yugos to Rolls
Royces - all scrapping for parts of a shrinking market. Last week,
foreign and domestic automakers reported car and truck sales that
resulted in the worst model year in the industry since 1983.
   ``The real question for GM is what does this vehicle do to other
GM products,'' Phillippi said. ``They've got to get a significant
number of sales - three-fourths - from non-GM family brands.''

   Shortly after the U.S.-Soviet business weekly
Commersant hit the newsstands in January, government ministers
started calling editorial offices to find out how to muzzle its
sharp commentaries.
   ``When they found out we were independent, they kind of lost
their bearings and gave up,'' said Vladimir Yakovlev, Commersant
editor-in-chief.
   Commersant and two other new Soviet periodicals owe their
independence in part to the policy of glasnost, or openness, and in
part to their backing from investors in the United States and other
Western countries.
   Unlike most Soviet publications, they are not affiliated with
the Communist Party or government and are not subject to the same
hierarchical pressures that Soviet bureaucrats are accustomed to
applying.
   Commersant, backed by the U.S. investment company Refco, is the
type of Soviet business that a visiting delegation from the New
York Stock Exchange will be scrutinizing during a three-day meeting
in Moscow this week.
   The tabloid provides a weekly barometer of the ups and downs of
foreign enterprises' performances in the Soviet Union and critical
features on Soviet economics.
   Although paper shortages have forced the government newspaper
Izvestia to miss editions twice, Commersant has a supply contract
with a private company, guaranteeing a steady flow of newsprint.
   Its Russian circulation is 350,000 and its English distribution
is 30,000, Yakovlev said. Commersan recently went on sale in the
United States.
   According to officials of the State Committee for the Press,
joint ventures have filed 23 applications to start publications.
Sixty applications have been filed by private individuals and 20 by
political parties and public organizations, the officials said.
   Two glossy magazines - Moscow and Business in the U.S.S.R. - are
building their circulations, and several pilot publications have
appeared.
   Izvestia and Hearst Publications published a pilot issue of a
new English-Russian newspaper on July 4 and hope to be issuing a
regular edition next year. The weekly magazine Business Week
brought out a dual language edition last summer and also hopes to
publish regularly.
   Special one-time editions of Western magazines, including Ladies
Home Journal and Paris Match, also have appeared in Soviet shops.
   Other joint venture magazines include New Farmer, an offshoot of
the U.S.-based Rodale Press that could distribute in the Soviet
Union next year to give Soviet farmers American agricultural
know-how, and Russian Business Review, a quarterly to be published
in 1991 by a Swiss-Soviet joint venture.
   Business in the U.S.S.R. is aimed at the emerging class of
Soviet business leaders, said editor Vadim Biryukov.
   ``We want to hit the right guy, the economist, the factory
director, the banker, the small businessman - anybody who deals
with the economy,'' he said.
   Until recently, the term ``businessman'' was disparaging,
Biryukov said. ``We are trying to change that. We clearly see all
our readers, we talk to them, try to give them the courage to
become businessmen, to be proud to be a businessman.''
   In a step designed to open the door for joint-venture
publishing, the Supreme Soviet parliament adopted a press law Aug.
1. Under the law, a new pubication can start after an application
is filed and a regestration fee of 2,000 ($3,200) is paid in hard
currency.
   That could pose a problem for Biryukov, who founded the magazine
earlier and may end up paying twice.
   ``We registered before the law was adopted, now we have to
register again,'' he complained. ``We haven't had time to earn that
kind of money.''
   Business in the U.S.S.R. published its sixth issue in October.
With a circulation of 100,000 editions in Russian and 50,000 in
English, the magazine relies heavily on advertising for hard
currency revenues.
   Moscow magazine is patterned after the trendy, glossy
publications that thrive in big American cities.
   ``We are styled a little after city magazines, like New York,''
said editor Derk Sauer, a Dutchman.
   But ``we are not a copy of New York. They are a lifestyle
magazine, and there's not a lot of lifestyle here in Moscow,'' he
said.

   Britain's long-delayed entry into Europe's
exchange rate mechanism could spur the European Community's move
toward economic and monetary union, but for Margaret Thatcher the
immediate motives are closer to home, analysts say.
   Linking the pound to other European currencies should stabilize
the pound's exchange rate, help fight inflation and bring down
interest rates, which could improve the prime minister's chances of
winning a fourth consecutive term.
   But the price of joining the so-called ERM could be a further
crimp on an already slowing economy and a rise in unemployment.
   The government announced Friday it would link the pound to the
mechanism on Monday. The government also said Britain's 15 percent
interest rates would come down a full percentage point the same
day.
   Under the mechanism, Britain's currency will be allowed to
fluctuate no more than 6 percent from an agreed-upon exchange rate.
   Putting a floor under the pound gives Mrs. Thatcher room to cut
high interest rates - unpopular with both homeowners and businesses
- before she must call an election by mid-1992.
   ``It was becoming urgent for the government to get interest
rates down if they were going to stop the next election being lost
on the recession issue,'' Robin Aspinall, analyst at the London
investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
   Britain already is in a mild recession, the business community
and opposition Labor Party say. No, it isn't, the government
argues.
   Mrs. Thatcher likes a strong pound because it adds up to tighter
monetary policy. It fights inflation by forcing companies to keep
export prices competitive by keeping wages and other costs down.
   But as a strong pound forces export prices higher, it becomes
harder for British companies to compete overseas. Corporate profits
can fall and jobs can be lost.
   ``Yes, ERM would impose a small discipline for bringing
inflation down, but it does so at the expense of growth,'' said
Avinash Persaud, a monetary economist at the London investment firm
UBS Phillips and Drew.
   Britain becomes the tenth of the 12 European Community
currencies to enter the exchange rate mechanism. Currencies of
Britain and Spain are allowed to flucutate 6 percent from the
agreed rate and the others are allowed to swing 2.25 percent in
either direction. Still outside the mechanism are the Portuguese
escudo and Greek drachma.
   Central banks of ERM member countries are required to buy or
sell currencies to keep the exchange rate within the prescribed
band.
   The ERM is intended to provide stable exchange rates that make
business planning easier and reduce disruptions to economic
strategies of the EC and its member states.
   After years of pressure from ERM advocates, Mrs. Thatcher in
June 1989 promised to join once British inflation fell closer into
line with the EC average of 5.5 percent, and once capital flowed
freely in Europe.
   Britain has decided to join even though inflation stands at 10.6
percent because the rate is headed downward, Mrs. Thatcher said
Friday. She has kept interest rates at 15 percent for a year to
fight inflation by slowing consumer demand.
   ``The fact that our policies are working and are seen to be
working have made both these decisions possible,'' she said.
   Entering the mechanism would ``underpin our anti-inflationary
stance,'' she said.
   Britain said the pound would enter the ERM at a rate of 2.95
German marks.
   By entering, Britain fulfilled its commitment to the first part
of a three-stage plan for the economic and monetary union of the EC
nations.
   But while spurring monetary union, the move also strengthened
Mrs. Thatcher's hand in fighting the next two stages - a single
currency and central banking system.
   ``It will make the path . . . easier,'' said Geoffrey Dicks, who
teaches at the London Business Schol. ``But it also will give the
U.K. a stronger base from which to launch its serious criticisms.''
   Instead of a single currency, Britain has proposed turning the
European Currency Unit into a 13th, common European currency to be
used alongside the existing 12 EC currencies.

   Here, in question-and-answer form, is an
explanation of Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, or ERM.
   What is the ERM?
   It is a feature of the European Monetary System that limits the
fluctuations of European Community currencies.
   Why was it set up?
   It was set up in March 1979 to prevent disruptive exchange rate
swings. The fixed exchange rates which had supported European
economies since World War II had broken down and the floating rates
were creating havoc for the 12-nation Community.
   Who belongs to the ERM?
   With newly joining Britain, 10 EC countries. Still to join are
Portugal and Greece.
   How does the ERM work?
   The ERM limits how much the currencies can move up or down
against one another. Most of the members observe a margin of 2.25
percent above or below agreed rates. But Britain and Spain use a 6
percent band, which gives their governments more breathing space.
   How do countries keep their currencies within those bands?
   Central banks intervene, buying or selling currencies or
changing their interest rates.
   Does it always work?
   No. Sometimes inflation or other economic conditions threaten to
push a currency beyond its band. When that happens, the members
realign the system by mutual agreement, changing the basic rates of
one or more currencies to relieve the pressure. There have been 14
rate or band realignments since 1979. The last was on Jan. 8, when
Italy switched from the 6-percent to the 2.25 percent band.
   Does the ERM affect European exchange rates against the dollar?
   It has no direct bearing on these currencies' values against
non-EC currencies.

   The United Auto Workers union and Ford
Motor Co. have tentatively agreed on a national labor contract
nearly identical to one reached with General Motors Corp. last
month.
   The three-year agreement reached with Ford on Sunday - like the
one reached with GM - includes a 3 percent pay raise in the first
year, lump-sum payments of 3 percent of wages in the second and
third years, an income guarantee for laid-off workers and no change
in health-care benefits.
   If the pact wins final approval, the union will turn its
attention to the last of the Big Three domestic automakers,
Chrysler Corp., said UAW President Owen Bieber.
   He added that he isn't worried about comments Chrysler officials
made after the GM contract was negotiated that they would have
trouble affording the same deal.
   The No. 3 U.S. automaker's third-quarter losses promise to wipe
out the $251 million it earned in the first two quarters of this
year.
   ``I don't get all shook up with them telling me how bad they
are,'' Bieber said Sunday.
   He added that the pace of talks between the UAW and Chrysler
would pick up soon, but said he wasn't sure when he would go to
Chrysler's headquarters in Highland Park.
   ``We're going to go to Chrysler as soon as we get the work done
here,'' he said.
   UAW's 135-member Ford bargaining council meets in Dearborn on
Tuesday for briefings on the Ford pact by Bieber and UAW Vice
President Ernie Lofton, who heads the union's Ford Department.
   The group of presidents and heads of bargaining committees from
the UAW's 44 locals at 79 Ford locations nationwide must approve
the contract before it is sent to the approximately 100,000 members
for a ratification vote.
   Lofton said he wants to have the ratification process finished
by Oct. 21. The agreement with GM was ratified by the company's
workers in an 80 percent to 20 percent vote announced a week ago.
   Among the provisions of the contracts the UAW negotiated with GM
and Ford are:
   -A 3 percent increase in base wages in the first year and
lump-sum payments of 3 percent of wages in the second and third
years with no changes in the cost-of-living protections for wages.
   -A commitment by the companies to fully pay employees laid off
for more than 36 weeks during the next three years because of sales
slumps. GM said it would spend up to $4 billion and Bieber
estimated that the Ford commitment would be about $1.5 billion.
   -Two lump-sum payments to retirees totaling $1,260.
   -A new schedule of penalties for scheduling excessive overtime
ranging up to $5 an hour. The previous maximum was $1.25 an hour.
   -No change in health-care provisions.
   The overtime penalty appeared to be the most worrisome to Ford
as talks accelerated last week. Ford makes more liberal use of
overtime than GM or Chrysler.
   But the overtime penalty doesn't appear to be a problem in the
near future because car and truck sales are down and economic
recovery doesn't appear to be close at hand, said Ford Chairman
Harold Poling.

   Persistent uncertainty about possible war in
the Persian Gulf and fear of crude oil shortages sent retail gas
prices upward an average 6 cents per gallon over the past two
weeks, an industry analyst says.
   Since the Iraqi invasion of oil-rich Kuwait in early August, the
average price of gasoline nationwide has jumped 26{ cents a gallon
at the pump. Since the crisis began, an international embargo has
blocked all Iraqi oil exports.
   The sale of Kuwaiti oil also was banned to prevent Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein from making money on appropriated crude oil
reserves. Increases in oil market prices were passed on to
consumers quickly.
   ``The cause, of course, is the continued pass-through of higher
crude oil prices, which is driven by fears of shortages due to
confrontation in the Middle East,'' analyst Trilby Lundberg said
Sunday in a telephone interview.
   The latest biweekly Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gasoline stations
nationwide showed the overall price of gas for all grades,
including taxes, was 144.20 cents per gallon. The survey was taken
Friday.
   The average price was 5.84 cents higher than the average derived
from a Sept. 21 Lundberg sampling, she said.
   The Lundberg Survey's overall average price on July 20 - the
latest pre-invasion sample - was nearly $1.18 a gallon.
   ``The price increases have really put on speed,'' said Lundberg,
adding that she was unable to predict whether prices would continue
their upward spiral.
   ``It's entirely dependent on what the crude oil market does,''
Lundberg said. ``It's insecurity, but not a world shortage. The
sensitivity of the market is tremendous.''
   The survey taken Friday showed the average price of regular
leaded gasoline, including taxes, at self-serve pumps was 130.59
cents per gallon. At full service stations, regular leaded averaged
152.21 cents.
   Self-serve unleaded was 133.56 cents per gallon, and
full-service unleaded was 155.11. Premium unleaded was 149.95 cents
per gallon at self-serve and 168.79 at full service.
   Lundberg notes self-service customers represent more than 80
percent of gasoline sales. ``The full service prices really
represent a specialty service that not too many use,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar plummeted to a 1{-year low against
the Japanese yen in heavy trading today because of rising pessimism
over the U.S. economy, traders said. Stock prices soared.
   The U.S. currency dropped 3.67 yen from Friday's close, ending
the day at 130.05 yen. It was the dollar's lowest closing level
since March 15, 1989, when it ended at 129.88 yen.
   The dollar also fell against European currencies.
   Toshiaki Kakimoto, a senior analyst with Sumitomo Bank, said
investors unloaded the dollar because of a belief the U.S. Federal
Reserve will lower interest rates following Friday's release of
worsening U.S. labor statistics.
   He said the failure to reach a deficit-reduction accord also
added to pessimism. ``These factors made investors think that U.S.
economic fundamentals are not likely to improve,'' Kakimoto said.
   A narrowing interest rate gap between the two countries also
made the dollar less attractive, analysts said.
   Compared to Friday's 7.94 percent Federal Funds rate, Japan's
counterpart call rate was only slightly lower at 7.65 percent
today.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 802.35 points, or 3.51 percent, ending the day at 23,630.00 in
moderate trading. The closely watched index rose 549.46 points on
Friday.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 400
million shares, compared with Friday's 450 million.
   Stock prices soared as investors, encouraged by the stronger yen
and rising bond prices, went bargain hunting. Traders said
index-linked buying also helped to send stock prices higher.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese bonds closed higher at 83.54, up from Friday's 82.90.
Their yield ended at 8.020 percent, down from Friday's 8.170
percent.

<HEAD>Bank Financing Falls Through on UAL Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The employee group trying to buy UAL Corp., the
parent of United Airlines, says it has failed for the second time
in two months to get bank financing, but it plans a bid Tuesday
using money from other sources.
   One analyst gave the endeavor little chance of success and said
the waning value of the group's offer is beginning to resemble ``a
K mart blue-light special.''
   Gerald Greenwald, chief executive officer of the United Employee
Acquisition Corp., announced Sunday that the $2 billion in bank
financing his group had hoped to assemble had disintegrated. He
blamed tight credit and economic uncertainties following the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The group instead will use a combination of cash and equity from
other sources to meet a Tuesday deadline to offer a bid, he said.
   Greenwald declined comment on how much the bid would total. A
statement from his group said only that it would be substantially
higher than the current price of UAL stock, which closed at $102.75
a share Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Substitute financing is to come from company suppliers;
sale-leaseback arrangements in which the company sells equipment
such as airplanes and leases them back; employee investments and
cash on hand, Greenwald said.
   ``We're trying to come to the board with - in total - an equally
attractive package,'' he said in a telephone interview from New
York. ``We are trying to make up the shortfall in cash with some
other features.''
   But analyst Stephen Dexter of Kemper Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago said he believes it will be very difficult to persuade
suppliers to finance the deal and also to sell the board on an
inevitably lower buyout offer than the $165 to $175 per share the
group was believed to have been readying.
   ``It's starting to look like a K mart blue-light special,'' he
said. ``You're marking down the price and marking down the price
until finally you get financing.''
   Two months ago, when the board granted the employee group an
extension to arrange financial backing, the employees were working
on a $201-a-share offer.
   That was far less than the $300-a-share bid that pilots and
management were trying to put together a year ago when financing
collapsed.
   Whatever the bid, the price should be higher than the value of
rival American Airlines - about $3.8 billion, Dexter said,
particularly since taking a company private should add a premium to
the price.
   If the United employees offered $165 to $175 a share, the total
would amount to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
   ``The two (United and American) are very similar in size, very
similar in domestic networks. But United has the real jewel of the
airlines industry - the Pacific division,'' Dexter said.
   ``It's much more profitable than the domestic or Atlantic
division. You should be paying more for that, not less. If board
members take out their pocket calculators, they're going to find it
just doesn't compute.''
   Dexter said if the board rejects the bid on Tuesday, he believes
the employee-buyout effort is ``a dead deal.''
   Greenwald said the banks were attracted by the deal but
concerned about economic uncertainties.
   ``Some of the banks who declined to participate said, `Yours is
the best proposal and most tempting one we've seen all year, but
we're just very worried about the economy,' '' Greenwald said.

<HEAD>OPEC Production at Pre-Crisis Quota Levels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Extra production by OPEC members in
September made up for 3 million of the 4 million barrel-a-day loss
caused by the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, the Middle East Economic Survey
reported Monday.
   But the respected newsletter said the world still faces a
shortfall in the fourth quarter of this year.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
produced an average 22.49 million barrels a day in September, the
Nicosia-based oil newsletter said. In July the cartel was producing
23.5 million barrels a day.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the world embargo on
exports from those two major producers, cut 4 million barrels a day
from OPEC quota exports.
   The Middle East Economic Survey said in September the increased
production came from Saudi Arabia with an extra 2.1 million barrels
a day, Venezuela 305,000, Nigeria 260,000, Iran 250,000 and Libya
100,000.
   ``It should not be forgotten that the world production system is
operating at a very full stretch,'' the newsletter said.
   It said OPEC crude production of 22.5 million barrels a day
compared with projected demand by the International Energy Agency
of 23.9 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter. This would
leave a need for consumers to draw down existing reserve stocks of
1.4 million barrels a day in the quarter.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister Hisham Nazer has estimated world
reserve stocks at 700 million barrels.
   The Middle East Economic survey said, however, that Saudi Arabia
plans to increase its production another 300,000 barrels a day to
7.8 million barrels a day in October ``with possible further
increments to be forthcoming in future months.''
   The newsletter said total OPEC production might be increased by
500,000 barrels a day to 23 million by the end of the year, mainly
from Saudi Arabia.

   Consumer sugar prices are starting to level
off, and Agriculture Department analysts say domestic and global
supplies are large enough to help dampen them for a while.
   ``On the world level, it looks like prices should stay about
where they're at,'' says Peter Buzzanell of the department's
Economic Research Service. ``The reason is that we see more of a
balance in world supply and demand.''
   Buzzanell said in a telephone interview that ``growth in
consumption out paced production (and) led to an upturn in prices''
in the last several years.
   However, he said, the price of raw sugar delivered to Caribbean
ports lately has been just a little more than 10 cents per pound,
compared to the 13 or 14 cents a few months ago.
   In the United States, Buzzanell said, the 1990 sugar cane crop
was hit by poor weather, but the sugar beet harvest is expected to
be improved from last year.
   Sugar consumption by Americans is still growing, but ``not at a
sharp rate,'' he said. ``So, with our new (import) quota, we're
anticipating that we'll have a balanced situation - and prices
about where they are or, hopefully, softening a little bit.''
   Buzzanell was asked to comment on a new sugar outlook report
issued last week by the USDA agency.
   In it, analysts noted that retail prices of refined sugar in the
United States averaged 41.8 cents per pound in the first nine
months of the 1990 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, up 2.7 cents
from the same period in 1989.
   The July average was 42.7 cents per pound, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it edged up to 43.3 cents in
August. The September prices have not yet been announced.
   Total domestic sugar production in the crop year that began
Sept. 1 is estimated currently at 6.47 million short tons of 2,000
pounds each, raw value, down 113,000 tons from 1989-90 production.
   Beet sugar output was estimated at 3.77 million tons, up 11
percent from the drought and freeze-damage crop of 1989-90. But
cane sugar production is expected to be only 2.7 million tons, down
15 percent because severe freeze damage and drought in Louisiana.
   A new ``tariff-rate quota'' was announced on Sept. 14 by
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. Under it, the United States
will import slightly more than 1.9 million tons of raw sugar during
the year that began Oct. 1.
   Under the new system, a two-tiered quota level is used, allowing
a fixed amount of sugar into the United States at a relatively low
duty rate of 0.625 cents per pound, and additional imports at a
much higher duty, an additional 16 cents per pound.
   The so-called TRQ system replaces an absolute quota which had
regulated U.S. sugar imports since 1982, the report said.
   Australia had complained about the earlier method of quotas, and
the United States was found to be in violation of rules under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The TRQ method puts the
United States in compliance under GATT, the report said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The number of cattle herds under quarantine
for brucellosis has edged below 1,000 for the first time since the
eradication program began nearly 60 years ago.
   According to Agriculture Department officials, at the beginning
of September there were 959 cattle herds quarantined for the
disease, down from 1,005 herds a month earlier.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, reducing the quarantine herds to
below 1,000 ``marks a significant point'' in the history of the
cooperative state-federal program against brucellosis.
   ``In the early 1930s, when eradication efforts first started, 5
percent of the nation's cattle herds were estimated to be infected
with brucellosis, a disease that causes abortions and lowers milk
production,'' he said. ``By the late 1950s, there were nearly
124,000 herds under quarantine. By 1980, this had been cut to
7,074; by 1985 to 4,533.''
   Currently, 29 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands have been
declared free of brucellosis.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rising milk production has boosted the output
of butter and other dairy products, according to a monthly report
by the Agriculture Department.
   In August, butter production was estimated at 83.8 million
pounds, up 4 percent from August 1989, the report said.
   Total cheese production was reported at 488 million pounds, up 7
percent from a year earlier, and non-fat dry milk for human food
was estimated at 62.9 million pounds, a 20 percent increase.
   Milk production in 1990 is forecast at a record 147.7 billion
pounds, compared with 144.3 billion last year and the previous high
of 145.2 billion pounds in 1988.

<HEAD>Rig Count Jumps By 17, Back With Seasonal Routine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY BENJAMINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas and Oklahoma led an increase in the number
of working oil and natural gas rigs in the United States, which
rose 17 this week to 1,064, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The Houston-based toolmaker reported Monday the count was up
from last week's 1,047, and was above the number for the same week
a year ago when 960 rigs were working across the country.
   The rise for the week was led primarily by Oklahoma, which
reported a gain of six rigs for the week, and Texas, which reported
a gain of four.
   ``Seasonally, this is the time when the rig count rises,'' said
I.C. Kerridge, a Baker Hughes vice president and keeper of the
count.
   Kerridge said the rig count dropped the last two weeks and
``this may be getting back on the seasonal track.''
   Baker-Hughes has kept track of the rig count - the widely
watched index of drilling activity - since 1940. The count
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those
producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Kerridge said higher oil prices have not yet affected the rig
count but said a 9 percent jump in workover rigs - used for routine
maintenance on producing rigs - was attributable to the higher
prices.
   ``We're looking for a strong fourth quarter,'' Kerridge said.
``People would like to see some stability and oil prices staying at
a reasonably high level. If that continues, will see increases in
the rig count.''
   Besides Oklahoma and Texas, other major oil producing states
that reported gains for the week included Colorado, up two;
Louisiana, up four; New Mexico, up three; and Pennsylvania, up one.
   Among states reporting a loss in drilling activity for the week
were California, down two; Kansas, down one; Ohio, down one; and
Wyoming, down five. North Dakota's rig count was unchanged.

   Before the referendum passed, comedian Jay Leno, on national
television, poked fun at the system's $1 million
how-to-be-more-frugal study. Until 1988, school board members were
driven to meetings by chauffeurs.
   It isn't just money. An April attendance report showed that only
21 schools had 90 percent to 94 percent attendance each day. A
dress code took effect this fall, a measure to curb violence such
as the shooting of an Osborn High School student over his $135
jacket, and the slaying of a Kettering High School student who was
stripped of his coat and $70 sneakers.
   Mayoral spokesman Bob Berg says racism is part of the city's
trouble. ``The city's about 70 percent black; the suburbs are
white,'' he says.
   ``There are people who brag about not coming downtown in years.
They say it's not racial. But it is.''
   Detroit's black population soared from 28.9 percent to 63.1
percent between 1960 and 1980, census data shows. Detroit's 1980
black population was the largest among the nation's 10 major
cities.
   The racial divide between Detroit and its suburbs is deepening,
as it is in Chicago, Baltimore and Gary, Ind., according to the
University of Michigan's 38th Detroit Area Study, its most recent.
   ``The social segregation is astonishing,'' says Steven
Rosenstone of the Ann Arbor school's Center for Political Studies.
Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties are 92.2 percent white, compared
with 75.1 percent black in Detroit. Detroit's 20.6 percent
unemployment includes people who have given up looking for jobs. A
third of Detroiters surveyed lacked access to a car in good
condition, meaning ``blacks cannot get out to the better-paying
jobs.''
   ``I think things are going to get worse before it gets better,''
Rosenstone says.
   What Detroit needs is jobs, says Berg, explaining Mayor Young's
sometimes controversial strategies - knocking down a neighborhood
for a Chrysler Corp. plant, plans to demolish another neighborhood
to expand the airport and to exploit the free trade pact,
encouraging more riverfront development such as the downtown
Renaissance Center complex.
   Detroit is lifting itself from the doldrums of population decay,
auto industry slumps and a bad image, say Hubbard and Berg.
   During last October's Devil's Night, about 30,000 residents from
an array of community groups patrolled the streets to dampen the
annual arson spree.
   The Detroit Civic Center hosted 14 percent more business in 1989
over 1988, an increase to 8.4 million visitors. A survey of 24
major metropolitan areas by national accounting firm Grant Thornton
found Detroit's economy advanced in the 1989 fourth quarter to its
highest in five years.
   The racial controversy over a white woman heading the council of
a mostly black city ended with Maryann Mahaffey's election last
fall to council president.
   The Detroit Pistons, who play their home games 30 miles north of
downtown, won their second straight NBA champsionship.
   Ten years from now, Detroit ``will be more of an information and
service industry for manufacturing. We'll be more of a convention
industry,'' Hubbard says, stressing the need to shift from the
cyclical auto industry that has dominated and determined much of
Detroit's past.
   And the city might just make it over the 1-million mark in the
census count, Neithercut says.
   Berg says there are easily 30,000 Detroiters missed by the
count.
   `II think all this is going to turn around. I think the movement
to the suburbs will collapse. You can't have a rotten core in the
doughnut,'' Rich says. ``The same economic forces working on the
city will work on them.
   ``People in the suburbs will realize they don't want those
overpriced homes and they'll reclaim the city,'' Rich says,
pointing to the so-called ``gentrification'' of Washington, D.C.
   ``Detroit is not going to be the Bangladesh of the Midwest.''

   IBM Hungary is the giant computer
company's window on the East.
   The subsidiary was one of the few Western companies to weather
more than four decades of communism in Hungary. Now it is serving
as IBM's model for expansion in the rest of Eastern Europe.
   Perhaps the reason communist authorities allowed a little bit of
capitalism to survive all those years is that it filled a vital
need: It serviced IBM machines that were used to perform the census
and other record-keeping, said Eugen K. Hahn, managing director of
Eastern European operations for International Business Machines
Corp.
   ``We took care of the equipment, so we protected the investment
the government made,'' he said in an interview at IBM's modernistic
headquarters building in a residential neighborhood.
   IBM Hungary employs nearly 100 people, all Hungarians, to sell
and service the company's products.
   Zsuzsa Branyik, who resigned as general manager of IBM Hungary
in April after about 20 years, recalled how the subsidiary managed
to survive during the communist years even though it was limited
largely to servicing equipment, not selling new machines.
   At one point in the 1960s, even the service operation was shut
down and the engineers transferred to the state. But in the early
1970s, the company was given back its employees and began to
flourish.
   ``It would be wonderful for me to work today - so many things
are much, much easier,'' said Mrs. Branyik, the only female head of
a country organization IBM has ever had.
   IBM has sales and service representatives throughout the former
East bloc, but it wants to establish a greater presence in these
nations along the lines of IBM Hungry, Hahn said.
   To increase its presence, IBM has donated computers to
universities in several Eastern European nations as part of what it
calls its academic initiative. In exchange, the universities are
expected to develop software and ties to local industry.
   IBM also plans to tie these universities together in a computer
network, and then link that network to the West - one of the first
such computer connections in the former East bloc, Hahn said.

<TEXT>
   Christopher Sinclair-Stevenson, a courteous Old
Etonian in the tough world of British publishing, broke away to set
up on his own after 28 years with one company and struck gold with
his first book.
   Sinclair-Stevenson Ltd. sold 60,000 copies of a life of
ever-popular Charles Dickens in less than two weeks at 19.95 pounds
($37.70) each. The sales sent ``Dickens'' to second place on The
Sunday Times best-seller list, behind a book on cricket.
   But what shook the book trade was the large sum of 650,000
pounds (nearly $1.3 million) offered by the fledgling independent
publisher to Peter Ackroyd, an admired writer who tackled Dickens
after doing other literary lives, some in novel form.
   ``It was an unusually large amount of money, but Ackroyd has a
good reputation and track record and the offer also covers a book
he is writing about William Blake,'' the publisher said.
   Sinclair-Stevenson, 51, talked in the office he set up with a
staff of 10 in a charming Kensington mews.
   He launched his company and the Dickens book Sept. 3, just over
a year after leaving the respected hardback publishing house of
Hamish Hamilton, his only employer since he left Cambridge
University with a modern languages degree. His last 15 years with
the firm were spent as managing director.
   He didn't like the changed atmosphere when the firm, which had
earlier been sold to the Canada-based Thomson group, was sold again
to Penguin, the giant paperback publisher.
   From friends and contacts he raised 2.4 million pounds ($4.5
million) to start his own company. When authors whose books he
edited found he was leaving they went with him, including Ackroyd.
   Sinclair-Stevenson is steering clear of paperback publishing,
and a large slice of Ackroyd's advance came from selling the
paperback rights in Dickens to other companies. Sales of the
hardback should comfortably make up the balance, he said.
   The new publisher's first catalog is half fiction and the rest
mostly travel, memoirs and contemporary history. Well-known writers
such as Paul Theroux, A.N. Wilson and J.K. Galbraith are on the
list, and of the 27 books, 20 are by authors from his old
employers.
   He handled most of the Hamish Hamilton authors who were
finalists over the years for the Booker Prize, the literary event
of the year in Britain.
   ``Most people thought William Boyd, who was a finalist in 1982
with `An Ice-Cream War,' should have been nominated again this year
for `Brazzaville Beach,' which we submitted. We will be in some
difficulty next year deciding which three of our novelists to put
in,'' the publisher said.
   Publishing is big business. Total book sales in Britain were
worth 2.2 billion pounds ($4.1 billion) last year. Book exports
amounted to a further 655 million pounds ($1.2 billion).
   The industry is dominated by about a dozen companies, among
them, Macmillan, the Oxford and Cambridge university presses and
HarperCollins and News International, which belong to media magnate
Rupert Murdoch.
   Publishing has changed vastly from the days when it was
considered a leisurely occupation for gentlemen. Revered imprints
have disappeared while others cling to their identities in the
embrace of multinationals and conglomerates.
   ``I think publishers take over other publishers to stop other
publishers taking them over. When they become big they want to be
strongly based everywhere,'' Sinclair-Stevenson said.
   ``A big organization has clout in the marketplace. It can afford
expensive authors, has more power in dealing with bookshops and a
bigger presence in the publishing world,'' he said.
   ``Corporate life is very different to that of an independent
publisher. I began to feel the imperatives in the Penguin group
were systems rather than books.
   ``Editors are concerned with publishing and selling but
conglomerates keep looking at their internal affairs. They work to
dotted lines, call meetings and tell people what to do. Their
authors get missed out,'' he said.
   ``When I left in July 1989, a lot of the authors I was handling
were my personal friends and I suppose they thought I was a good
publisher and would do their future books well. I think they felt
that once I'd gone, their connection with Hamish Hamilton ceased:
They wouldn't know anyone there.''
   Writers are important, Sinclair-Stevenson said. ``They lead
rather lonely lives. They are not going to an office every day and
they need encouraging to write and to live as well. I like to
publish authors I know and like. I find it difficult to publish
authors I don't like.''
   He thinks the spate of mergers isn't good for publishing.
   ``It concentrates too much power in too few hands, narrows the
choice for the author and reduces the contact between the author,
his agent and the publishers,'' he said. ``I think we did `Dickens'
as well as any conglomerate and possibly better, because it's our
lifeblood.
   ``We are hungrier,'' he said. ``We have no fat to live off.''

   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, on Monday said net income declined during the third
quarter and the year's first nine months as the acquisition of
Telerate Inc. weighed on profits.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 totaled $23.76
million, or 24 cents a share, down 17.5 percent from $28.81
million, or 29 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $408.54 million, up 1.1 percent
from $404.08 million a year ago.
   The company said net income for the quarter was reduced 11 cents
- and 34 cents for the year to date - due to higher expenses
related to the acquisition of Telerate, which was completed in
January.
   Dow Jones also said operating results were distorted by
development costs for Telerate's electronic foreign exchange
trading system. This year Dow Jones bore 100 percent of the costs;
last year the company shared the cost with a 50 percent partner.
   Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $185.11 million within the company's
information services unit, which includes Telerate, but operating
income within the segment was down 36.1 percent at $35.01 million
in part because of retrenchment within the financial services
industry.
   On the publishing front, Dow Jones said operating income from
its business publications, including the Journal, Barron's magazine
and others, fell 79.6 percent to $2.72 million on a 3.6 percent
decline in revenue, which totaled $165.84 million. Advertising
lineage at the Journal declined 16 percent during the period.
   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspaper subsidiary, saw
a 7.4 decline in operating income, which totaled $2.72 million, on
$59.59 million in revenue, which represented a 1.5 percent gain
from the third quarter of 1989.
   For the first nine months, Dow Jones said net income totaled
$83.51 million, or 83 cents a share, down 69.9 percent from $277.17
million, or $2.75 a share in the year-ago period.
   Excluding a one-time gain in 1989, net income for the first nine
months declined 26.1 percent.
   Revenue for the first nine months totaled $1.28 billion, up 2.3
percent from $1.25 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   A new European proposal to slash government
farm subsidies to break a deadlock with the United States in world
trade talks would sacrifice farmers, an organization of European
farm groups said Monday.
   European agriculture ministers considered the plan Monday for
the first time since it was unveiled last week by the European
Commission - the executive body of the 12-nation European
Community.
   The ministers planned to discuss the proposal next Monday after
getting more details on how the plan would affect farmers.
   COPA, an umbrella organization for farm groups, announced its
opposition to the plan immediately. COPA President Joseph Yverneau
said the proposals ``are unacceptable and we totally reject them.''
   ``They are totally sacrificing the agriculture sector,'' he told
a news conference. ``We should not be put on our knees.''
   Yverneau, a French farmer, estimated that at least half the
farmers in Europe would be affected adversely by the farm plan.
   The community's new proposal calls for a 30 percent reduction in
farm subsidies for such major products as cereals, rice, sugar and
livestock over the period 1986 to 1996. A 10 percent cut is offered
in fruits, vegetables and tobacco.
   No specific trims are suggested in the community's costly export
subsidy program. But the proposal signals a willingness to
negotiate reductions with other nations.
   Germany's agriculture minister, Ignaz Kiechle, said the proposal
didn't gain much initial support from the European farm officals.
He said 10 of the 12 farm chiefs were ``critical to very critical''
of the proposal.
   British Agriculture Secretary John Gummer, who supports subsidy
trims, challenged the United States to meet the trading bloc's
proposal.
   ``I would very much like to see the Americans match it,'' he
said
   The dispute over farm payments has stalled the Uruguay Round of
international trade talks, which are designed to overhaul the world
trading system.
   The four-year negotiations, which end in December, are aimed at
reducing barriers to trade in 15 areas, including agriculture,
textiles and other manufactured goods and services, such as banking
and investment.
   The American push to get the community to do more to cut its
farm payments has angered its trading partner.
   Gummer said the export subsidies are ``part and parcel'' of the
community's farm program.
   ``Just because the United States doesn't like the system we use
doesn't mean for some reason or other we shouldn't have a
measurement which is fair to everybody,'' he said.
   He also told reporters the U.S. government ``is a very major
subsidizer of its farmers.''
   The Bush administration is expected to unveil a new bargaining
position on farm payments before a deadline next Monday at the
trade talks.
   The U.S. position is expected to include a 10-year plan for
reductions of up to 70 percent in domestic supports and import
duties and more than that in export subsidies.
   The U.S. has backed off a previous demand for elimination of
export subsidies.
   The American plan also would force the community to widen its
markets to foreign farm goods and slash farm payments that
encourage overproduction.
   The trade ministers gather later this week to discuss the
proposal before it is formally put on the table at the trade talks.
   The Uruguay Round is being held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and agreement for
removing trade barriers.

   Bertelsmann AG, the German media
giant, has acquired the top book publisher in former East Germany,
the company said Monday.
   Bertelsmann bought Graphischer Grossbetriev Poessneck GmbH
(GGP), which employs about 1,000 people in making 50 million books
a year.
   Bertelsmann said the takeover would open the door to the East
European publishing market because of GGP's excellent connections.
The financial terms of the purchase was not disclosed.
   GGP, founded in 1891, is located in the town of Poessneck, not
far from the border with Czechoslovakia.
   Its main business has been related to textbooks published for
the Soviet Union, Bertelsmann said. However, a large portion of
GGP's traditional contracts are not expected to be taken over, the
media giant said.
   Bertelsmann said its own European publishing houses, located in
Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy and Portugal, currently are working
at capacity, making about 200 million books a year.
   Bertelsmann has actively pursued an expansion program in Eastern
Europe.

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .79 to 171.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .10 at 306.38.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 82.09 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Limited Soviet Stock Exchange Possible Next Year, Wall Street Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trading on a Soviet stock exchange could start
next year, but foreigners probably will remain on the sidelines
until the ruble is convertible, the chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange said Monday.
   ``It's not going to look like some kind of enormous exchange ...
but it could begin in a modest way,'' chairman John Phelan Jr. said
in an interview at Moscow's international trade center. ``I think
it's a real possibility.''
   Phelan and a delegation of 20 prominent Wall Street businessmen
were invited to Moscow to give a three-day seminar on the nuts and
bolts of running a stock market. Dealings in stocks and bonds has
been illegal in the Soviet Union since the 1917 revolution.
   The Kremlin, with the enthusiastic backing of budding Soviet
speculators and entrepreneurs, is preparing to allow the return of
financial markets as part of the transition to a free market
economy. The most radical economic blueprints under consideration
call for the establishment of a stock exchange within 100 days.
   Phelan predicted that whatever economic plan is finally adopted,
within the next 18 months the government will have reorganized
financial structures, permitted the development of private
companies and lifted legal restrictions on private transactions
between individuals.
   ``That would be the logical time for the stock exchange to
form,'' he said, adding it could begin as soon as late 1991.
   More than 400 Soviet bankers, economists, academics and
government officials attended the crash course on securities,
American style, seeking explanations for several concepts foreign
to communist ideology and to their command economy.
   How does a company get listed on the NYSE, one asked? How do you
prevent the government from meddling in market prices? Do American
stock exchanges compete with one another? How are dividends paid?
   Joseph Grano, president for retail sales and marketing of
PaineWebber Inc., said it was critical that private ownership
develop at the same time as a stock exchange ``for this dream to
come to fruition.''
   He recommended the privatization of large state enterprises,
particularly in the oil industry, before allowing more private
ownership of smaller, riskier businesses.
   ``They need some success stories and if they can show a high
concentration of workers, a high concentration of investors, how it
works and how successful it can be, then I believe you've started
changes in the mindset,'' Grano said in an interview.
   Since June, the government has permitted the creation of
joint-stock companies, although it usually retains a majority of
shares. Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov told the seminar more than
400 such companies have been set up.
   ``The genie's out of the bottle. Nothing can get it back in
again,'' said William Schreyer, chairman and chief executive
officer of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. during a break in the seminar.
   Phelan later told a news conference that long-term foreign
investment in a Soviet stock market probably would require a fully
convertible ruble, the right to export profits and the right to
receive dividends in a stable currency. The state now controls the
price of the ruble against world currencies.
   The Soviet public will need to overcome its lingering sentiment
that profits are wrong and based on exploitation, and its fear of
taking financial risks, several Wall Street participants said.
   ``You have to learn to fall before you can walk,'' said lawyer
Joseph Flon. ``There will be ups and there will be downs. The
market reflects changes in society, changes in the world.''
   Schreyer said public education is still needed, but added, ``I
just got the sense that maybe profit wasn't quite as dirty a word
as it was.''
   The Soviet government has licensed one brokerage house, although
it hasn't started work yet. A committee of business people said it
hopes to register the first stock exchange in Moscow next month,
regardless of whether the government has passed the necessary laws.
   ``We don't have anything, we don't have space, we don't have the
specialists,'' said banker Yuri Chetverikov. ``We have only ideas,
and people are very eager to structure this kind of business.''

<HEAD>Benetton, Soviets to Launch Joint Venture In Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casual wear manufacturer Benetton Group SpA
said Monday it has entered a joint venture to produce clothes in
Armenia for sale in the Soviet Union.
   Under the agreement, Milan-based Benetton and the Armenian
Ministry of Light Industry each will invest $4 million to set up
production of cotton Benetton products at an Armenian factory.
   The goods will be sold in an unspecified number of stores
Benetton will open in the republic and in other Soviet cities,
according to a company statement.
   Benetton projected profits of $11 million - to be received in
Russian rubles - after the first three years of operation. Revenues
are expected to equal $81 million after three years, based on
annual production of 3 million items.
   Benetton's investment in the Armenian venture is the latest in a
series of steps toward tapping Eastern Europe's emerging consumer
market.
   Benetton already has a store in Moscow, nine stores in Hungary,
five in Czechoslovakia and two in Poland.

<HEAD>Ford Shutting 2 Ohio Plants Next Week; Shortage of Dealer Orders
Blamed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will close two plants in
northern Ohio next week because of a shortage of dealer orders,
United Auto Workers and company officials said Monday.
   Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said the Lorain assembly plant,
which makes Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird cars, would be
closed for a week beginning Monday. The shutdown affects more than
4,800 workers.
   He said the shutdown was caused by a lack of dealer orders. The
factory was closed for three weeks in January, a week in February,
two weeks in April, two weeks in August and one week in September.
   Pitcoff said the August closing was caused by a shortage of trim
materials, but the other shutdowns were the result of sagging
dealer orders.
   Don Schnur, president of UAW Local 2000, said there also will be
a weeklong shutdown at the company's Avon Lake Econoline van plant,
affecting about 1,400 employees.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf is partly to blame for that
shutdown, Schnur said.
   Pitcoff said van conversion operations have cancelled some
orders since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   Oil prices moved up almost $1 per barrel on the
futures market Monday as traders decided a lack of news from the
Middle East made war seem more likely than peace.
   Light sweet crude traded as high as $39.40 per barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange before settling at $38.95, up 96 cents
from Friday, on contracts for November delivery.
   Later contract months were all up by anywhere from 63 cents to
90 cents a barrel. Volume was fairly light because of the Columbus
Day holiday.
   Rising crude prices helped lift heating oil and gasoline
futures.
   Home heating oil rose .26 cent to $1.0296 a gallon for November
contracts, with all other delivery months also moving up. Unleaded
gasoline went up 1.11 cents to 93.75 cents for November delivery,
with other months also trading higher.
   Natural gas was off .5 cent to $1.93 per 1,000 cubic feet for
November contracts. Other delivery months were trading higher, with
December at $2.55, January at $2.81 and February at $2.60.
   Although there was no news dominating the markets, broker Brian
Tagler at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said the items watched by
traders were construed as bullish.
   They included statements from Iraq that attempted to link the
Kuwait crisis with Israeli territorial disputes and news that two
U.S. pilots were killed in a jet crash while the military looked
foing 95 on option - to add to its fleet of

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed in Light Holiday Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were mixed Monday in light holiday
dealings.
   U.S. Treasuries changed hands only overseas, as domestic
government bond markets were closed for the Columbus Day holiday.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 9-32 point, or $2.81
per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when the price
falls, increased to 881 percent from 8.78 percent late Friday.
   Short-term government issues rose while intermediate-term and
long-term bonds fell. Credit-market analysts said that reflected
nervousness about investing in longer-term bonds until the federal
budget impasse was resolved.
   ``In times of uncertainty, there's a propensity to stay short in
terms of investment,'' said John V. Sebastian, executive vice
president with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   Congress met Monday despite the holiday as lawmakers sought a
budget agreement that would avoid a government shutdown on Tuesday.
   Early Monday, a divided House passed a new budget plan and sent
it to the Senate. In order to achieve a $500 billion cut in the
deficit, the plan could lead to tax increases even higher than the
$134 billion that originally had been proposed.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.24
percent as the discount held at 7.03 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were unchanged at 7.42 percent as the discount stayed at 7.07
percent. Yields on one-year bills remained at 7.49 percent as the
discount was unchanged at 7.01 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investent in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   Prices of short-term governments rose 1-32 point to 1-16 point,
intermediate maturities fell 3-32 point to 7-32 point and long-term
issues lost about \ point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   Federal funds quotes weren't available Monday because the
Federal Reserve was closed for the holiday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 88 23-32, unchanged from late
Friday. The average yield to maturity was 7.77 percent, also
unchanged.

<TEXT>
   Stock market and foreign exchange traders
responded enthusiastically Monday to Britain's sudden entry of the
pound into the mechanism that regulates most European currency
exchange rates.
   British homeowners were optimistic that Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major's simultaneous announcement Friday of a 1
percent drop in interest rates could signal a turnaround from two
years of economic gloom.
   The exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary
System links European currencies to avert huge swings in exchange
rates. With British membership, 10 of the currencies of the
12-nation European community are linked in the system.
   Portugal and Greece still have not added their currencies. Bank
of Portugal Governor Jose Tavares Moreira said Monday that Portugal
would not be rushed into the system despite Britain's entry.
   There had been speculation in the market Friday that the escudo
could follow the pound.
   Under the rules of EMS membership, the British government must
halt any rise in the pound outside its upper band of 3.13 German
marks to the pound.
   Sterling is allowed to range within 6 percent of its central
rate of 2.96, so its lowest exchange rate is 2.77 marks.
   If the currency goes too high, Britain must lower its exchange
rate either by selling sterling or reducing interest rates.
   Britain's entry to the EMS boosted the pound to 3.03 marks on
Monday from 2.99 at Friday's close on the foreign exchange markets.
   The dollar-pound exchange rate is not directly affected by
Britain's entry into the system, but the pound soared against the
dollar Monday on concerns about the U.S. economy and the lack of a
plan for budget deficit cuts in the United States, currency dealers
said.
   The pound rose in London to $1.9745 from $1.9455 late Friday and
in New York, to $1.9760 from $1.9525.
   Economists said entry into the system won't be a panacea, but
said it was long overdue.
   ``We've joined a club we should have been in for quite some
time,'' said Trevor Cass, foreign exchange manager at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd. ``Over the last five years we have seen the European
economies benefiting from ERM. The U.K. wants a slice of that.''
   Traders on the London Stock Exchange were equally enthusiastic.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up nearly
140 points at Monday's opening before slipping back to close up
57.7 points, at 2,201.6. A record 1.085 billion shares traded
hands.
   ``This is the first fresh buying we have seen in ages,'' one
trader said.
   ``The initial euphoria has faded and in the cold light of day
there are other things to look at besides ERM,'' another trader
said.
   Those other things included the continuing Persian Gulf crisis.
   Ian Amstad, senior economist at Chase Investment Bank, said the
market's ``initial knee-jerk reaction to entry has passed. People
are now going away to think about what it all means.''
   The producer price input figure, released Monday, showed the
sharpest monthly jump in 14 years, a 2.2 percent increase from
August to September.
   The more trustworthy inflation indicator, the consumer price
index, is due out Friday. Inflation was running at 10.6 percent in
August - an 8{-year high. September's figure is expected to be
higher because of oil price increases.
   But British homeowners and mortgage brokers were optimistic that
interest rates fell to 14 percent.
   In Luxembourg, Major shrugged off criticism that the drop was
made for political reasons. Recent polls have shown the Labor Party
with a 12 percent to 14.5 percent lead over the governing
Conservative Party, which was to begin its annual political
conference Tuesday.
   He said he reduced rates because ``U.K. domestic monetary and
real circumstances, in my judgment, merited it.''
   Britain's slumping building societies, the equivalent of U.S.
savings and loans, moved quickly to lower mortgage rates after
Major announced the 14 percent rate.
   Sharon Chilcott, spokeswoman for Bristol and West Building
Society, said the mortgage market had been slow for about two
years.
   ``It will take some time for it to pick up,'' she said. ``It may
take another fall in interest rates to really get it going again.''

   The stock market settled for a moderate advance
in a quiet session Monday amid revived hopes for action to narrow
the federal budget deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.12 to 2,523.76.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
822 up, 627 down and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 99.47 million
shares, down from 153.38 million Friday and the lightest total
since a 92.94 million-share day on Sept. 4.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 123.96 million shares.
   The House passed a new budget plan overnight, raising an
alternative to the proposal that was rejected in Congress last
week.
   Analysts said investors were hopeful that an agreement would be
reached soon on a budget aimed at narrowing the gap between the
government's revenues and spending.
   Brokers also said traders' spirits got a lift from gains in
several foreign stock markets, from Tokyo to London.
   The Dow Jones industrials jumped about 30 points at the opening,
but then began gradually settling back. Activity was muted by the
absence of many market participants who were taking a Columbus Day
holiday.
   UAL tumbled 11{ to 91\ on word that a union group seeking to buy
the company couldn't get bank financing for a bid in the range of
$165 a share to $170 a share.
   Travelers Corp. fell 2 to 14&rsqb; on top of a 4&rsqb;-point drop Friday,
when the company estimated a $500 million third-quarter loss and
cut its dividend by one-third.
   British stocks were strong for the second straight session,
benefiting from Britain's plan to join in the European Monetary
System's exchange-rate mechanism.
   British Telecom rose 1| to 56}; Barclays 1{ to 30\; British Gas
1 to 56}, and National Westminster 2&rsqb; to 34&lsqb;.
   Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, up 1\ at 109{; General Electric, up \ at 54{;
Procter &amp; Gamble, up ~ at 80; General Motors, up | at 37{, and
DuPont, up { at 34&rsqb;.
   Abbott Laboratories climbed 1 to 41&rsqb;. The company reported
third-quarter profits of 51 cents a share, up from 44 cents in the
like period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $13.57 billion, or
0.46 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .95 to 171.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.16 to 369.08, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.98 at 313.48.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added

   The mighty British pound took center stage again
in foreign exchange Monday, while the dollar weakened against all
major currencies amid continued economic jitters.
   Gold prices rose after declining overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $394.90 a troy ounce, up $1.30 from late
Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $395 an ounce, up $1.
   Trading was described as thin, with many U.S. banks closed or
with abbreviated trading schedules in observance of Columbus Day.
   ``It was just a lackluster market,'' said Timothy Barton, an
assistant vice president and trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago.
   Barton said technical factors, along with concerns about the
weakness in the U.S. economy, helped depress the dollar.
   Most traders here and abroad also were awaiting a new
deficit-reduction package. The House passed a new budget plan
overnight Sunday, raising an alternative to a proposal that was
rejected in Congress last week.
   Efforts to narrow the gap between the government's revenues and
spending will likely result in a drop in interest rates, and that
is expected to further depress the dollar.
   Market activity continued to focus on the British pound's entry
into the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System.
The mechanism links European currencies to one another to avoid
large swings in exchange rates.
   The move is expected to help Britain fight inflation and improve
that country's economic prospects.
   The pound jumped to $1.9745 from $1.9455 late Friday in London,
and to $1.9760 from $1.9525 in New York.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to a 1{-year low against the Japanese yen,
closing at 130.05 Japanese yen, down from 133.72 yen Friday. It
traded at 130.70 yen in London, and 130.475 in New York, down from
132.20.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.53225 German marks, down from 1.5475; 1.2800
Swiss francs, down from 1.2940; 5.1300 French francs, down from
5.1850; 1,151.50 Italian lire, down from 1,160.25; and 1.15135
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1524.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday: 1.5355
German marks, down from 1.5372; 1.2840 Swiss francs, down from
1.2847; 5.1400 French francs, down from 5.1473; 1.7315 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.7340; 1,150.75 Italian lire, down from
1,160.50; and 1.1515 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1538.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $392.45 an ounce from
$394.35 late Friday. In Zurich, gold closed at $391.80 an ounce,
down from $394.40.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.26 to close at a bid $388.69
an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.670 a troy ounce, up 0.3 cent
from late Friday. Silver fell in London to $4.67 an ounce from
$4.69.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Soar on Harvest Delays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices soared as much as 17 cents a bushel
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy speculative buying
spurred by harvest delays in the soggy Midwest. Grain futures also
advanced.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures rose; precious metals
were mixed; pork futures fell sharply; and cattle were mixed.
   Soybeans settled 5\ cents to 17 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in November up 17 cents at $6.34 a bushel; October
soybean meal surged $8.40 to $191.80 a ton.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents to 5{ cents higher with December
at $2.79\ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 5\ cents higher with
December at $2.34 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with
December at $1.23{ a bushel.
   Soybean futures opened modestly higher and climbed gradually
until about an hour before the close, when sudden strength in the
soymeal market sparked rounds of buying by chart-based speculators,
analysts said.
   ``It was Katie-bar-the-door and we had a strong run to the
close,'' said David Armstrong, soybean analyst with AgriVisor
Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Cold, rainy weather kept farmers from their fields across a
broad band of the Midwestern soybean country Sunday and Monday.
Farmers in some areas may have to wait two or three days for fields
to dry out, said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
grain-trading operations in Chicago.
   In addition to delaying the soybean harvest, which is less than
half complete, rain can cause yield losses.
   ``Every time you wet a mature soybean pod and it dries out
again, it cracks open a little more and the beans can fall out, so
more of them end up on the ground and fewer of them end up in the
machine,'' Armstrong said.
   The rally followed a USDA report late Friday that U.S. exporters
had sold 205,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal to the Soviet
Union in addition to the 150,000 metric tons reported earlier.
   But Zusel said the market already had discounted the meal sales,
which were the subject of rumors early last week.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures rose sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting continued bullishness amid a lack
of conciliatory gestures by Iraq in the Persian Gulf standoff.
   ``The markets have a natural tendency to stick with a trend
until its reversed,'' said Peter Beutel, energy analyst with the
Pegasus Econometric Group, a commodities research firm in Hoboken,
N.J.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 5 cents to 96 cents higher with
November at $38.95 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to 1.2 cents
higher with November at $1.0296 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .65
cent to 1.11 cents higher with November at 93.75 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures rose moderately on New York's Commodity Exchange,
following crude oil, but silver futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.30 higher with October at $394.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.7 cent lower to 0.3 cent higher with
December at $4.728 a troy ounce.
   Pork futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after
posting sharp gains last week. Cattle futures were mixed.
   All pork belly contracts fell the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound amid profit taking. Hog futures also dropped sharply,
pressured by spillover selling from the belly pit and by lower cash
hog prices.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
October at 79.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower
to .33 cent higher with October at 88.15 cents a pound; hogs were
.10 cent to 1.25 cents lower with October at 55.92 cents a pound;
pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with February at
64.45 cents a pound.

   A plan to create a new rail link between key
East Coast ports and the Canadian interior may fall apart because
of a short stretch of tracks between Buffalo and Niagara Falls,
N.Y.
   The tracks - known as the Buffalo-Niagara Gateway - belong to
the Consolidated Rail Corp., which has gone to a special court over
the dispute with Canadian Pacific Ltd.
   ``I wouldn't want to be in the position of saying what's
motivating Conrail in all of this but certainly a major competitor
in their back yard has got to be of concern to them,'' Canadian
Pacific spokesman John Cox said last week.
   ``There are two issues embedded in one - whether the trackage
rights are available to us and, second, what the cost will be.
Right now we're blocked on both fronts,'' he said.
   Canadian Pacific has offered to buy the financially ailing
Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway and link it at Niagara Falls to CP Rail
tracks into southern Ontario. If it can't get the trackage rights,
CP may withdraw its $25 million offer, Cox said.
   Cox said the stretch of track was about 15 miles long. On
Monday, Conrail said it was 30 miles. Cox could not be reached to
resolve the discrepancy because of the Canadian holiday of
Thanksgiving on Monday. The spokesman for D&amp;H was not in his office
Monday.
   The link is vital to Canadian Pacific's plan to use the D&amp;H
system to connect the ports of Philadelphia and New York with the
Canadian interior. If CP can put all the pieces together, it will
be competing directly with Conrail for freight in the Northeast.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad,
filed in July 1988 for protection from its creditors under U.S.
bankruptcy laws. The railroad, which runs from Montreal to
Washington and between Albany and Buffalo, owes about $100 million.
   CP took over operation of the D&amp;H in August and agreed to absorb
any further financial losses, which had been running at about
$200,000 a month.
   On Oct. 1, Conrail took the track dispute to a special
three-judge court, which was created in the 1970s to oversee the
railroad bankruptcy proceedings that created Conrail. Court
spokesman Richard Eriksen said the panel would hear the case in
Washington sometime between Oct. 10 and the end of the month.
   ``Conrail filed its motion with the special court because that
court has indicated in the past that Conrail should bring cases
Conrail believes are under the court's jurisdiction to the special
court,'' Conrail spokesman David Neurohr said last week.
   On Monday, Neurohr said Conrail believes CP should pay its fair
share to maintain the Buffalo-Niagara tracks, although he declined
to give dollar amounts.
   ``Under Conrail's proposal, CP and Conrail would both contribute
capital funds proportionate to each railroad's use of the tracks,''
Neurohr said, reading from a statement. ``Although the tracks are
now in satisfactory condition, the dramatic increase in tonnage
proposed by CP is likely to impose an expensive maintenance and
repair burden on Conrail that would not otherwise be incurred.''
   Conrail negotiated trackage rights with D&amp;H in 1976 but those
rights were never exercised, Cox said. Conrail is arguing that
those rights would not extend to CP as the new D&amp;H owner.
   In addition, Cox said, Conrail is seeking to raise the per-car
cost for running trains over its tracks.
   ``Standard agreements between railways these days for operating
trains over another railway's line - it's a mileage rate per car -
can be anything between about 21 or 22 cents per car-mile to 50 to
55 cents per car-mile,'' he said.
   That would translate to $6 to $10 per car, he said.
   ``But what they're looking for is $145 in each direction, so
that's a bit of difference,'' he said.
   This is the second time that Conrail has thrown up a roadblock
in CP's effort to buy the D&amp;H. Earlier this year, Conrail refused
to negotiate the rights to its tracks between Hagerstown, Md., and
Harrisburg, Pa. This led CP to withdraw its initial $35 million bid
for the D&amp;H.
   CP later offered $25 million for the D&amp;H, a bid that was
accepted in May by the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the railroad's
reorganization.
   Last week, the Interstate Commerce Commission added its
unanimous vote of approval to the deal, and the matter appeared to
be headed to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., for the
finishing touches.
   But that hearing has been postponed from Oct. 10 to Nov. 2
because of the special court case.
   CP owns about 14,000 miles of tracks in Canada and about 5,000
in the United States.

   Work force illiteracy is likely to be a rising
problem during the 1990s, but few corporations are preparing for an
influx of workers who lack necessary reading skills, a prominent
research group said Monday.
   ``Illiteracy has been a softly ticking time bomb across
corporate America,'' said Leonard Lund, education specialist of The
Conference Board. ``While precise data are not available, the
evidence strongly suggests that the work force skills of many
youngsters are declining at a time when new jobs are becoming
increasingly sophisticated.''
   The study focused on 163 large corporations and found that
nearly 20 percent reported problems finding people who can read
well enough for entry-level jobs. Almost half the companies said
between 15 percent and 35 percent of their workers cannot handle
more complex tasks.
   The Conference Board said 10 percent of the companies surveyed
have found up to half of their workers do not have the necessary
skills to be promoted.
   Most of the companies contribute money to programs aimed at
fighting illiteracy, but few have their own programs, the
researchers said.
   The Conference Board found that more than 70 percent of the
surveyed companies have no formal procedures for testing
entry-level job candidates for reading and writing skills.
   Based in New York, the Conference Board is a business-financed
research organization that conducts wide-ranging studies into
economic trends.

<HEAD>Interco Reports Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., a footwear and furniture maker
struggling to bounce back from huge debt, reported a loss of $35.3
million, or $1.53 a share, in the second quarter.
   The loss was the result of flat sales in the company's four core
businesses, along with more than $64 million in interest expenses
paid by the St. Louis-based company.
   Chairman Richard Loynd said the poor performance was in line
with what the company expected because of the soft state of the
nation's economy.
   In last year's second quarter, Interco reported a profit of
$118.6 million, or $2.43 per share, but that included the sale of
several companies, including Ethan Allen Furniture and Senack
Shoes, which brought the company $210 million.
   Sales from continuing operations in the quarter ended Aug. 31
were $369 million, down 14 percent from $430 million in the same
period a year ago. Sales from the company's core businesses in last
year's third quarter were $371.3 million.
   In July, Interco reached an agreement with its numerous
creditors on a complicated deal to restructure more than $1.6
billion in debt that the company took on in 1988 to fend off a
hostile takeover attempt.
   The deal between Interco and its banks, medium-term noteholders
and subordinated debenture holders helped the company avert
bankruptcy.
   Since 1988, Interco has been selling off subsidiaries in an
attempt to repay its debts. It has retained four companies:
Converse Inc., Florsheim shoes, Lane Co. and Broyhill Furniture
Industries.
   The plan to sell off assets to pay off the debt faltered,
however, when Interco subsidiaries brought far less than the
company had anticipated.
   For the first six months, Interco reported a loss of $76.5
million, or $3.21 per share, compared with a profit of $87 million
or $1.14 a share for the same period last year. Sales for the first
half were $727 million, down from $899 million for last year's
first six months.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International
Inc. said Monday it has purchased the third largest cigarette brand
in former East Germany.
   The company signed an agreement with the former East German
State Trust, Treuhandanstalt, to acquire Club. It currently holds a
15 percent share of the local brand segment in the former East
German market.
   Club has been sold and marketed by RJR Tobacco International's
German subsidiary, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco GmbH, under a contractual
agreement since March 1990.
   RJR began selling its Camel, Winston and Reyno brands in East
Germany earlier this year. Company officials said the purchase of
Club would give RJR an additional foothold in the eastern German
market.
   Production of the brand will be moved next year from eastern
Berlin to an RJR facility in Germany.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco is a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc.

   Continental Airlines has ordered 25 new Boeing
757 jets - with an option for 25 more - in a deal potentially worth
more than $2.4 billion, airline officials said Monday.
   ``We're looking at the long-term needs of the airline,''
Continental spokesman David Messing said. ``We know we have higher
fuel prices, and some expect a recession, but we want to add
capacity for when the economy returns to strength.''
   The order for the first 25 jets is valued at $1.2 billion,
Messing said. The option on the second package of jets sets about
the same price, but will adjusted for inflation, he said.
   The 757, a twin-engine aircraft that seats up to 190 passengers,
will replace older aircraft when delivery begins in May 1993.
   The planes would help the airline save money if fuel prices
remain high because they're more fuel-efficient than other models,
Messing said.
   ``This order is a significant component of a well-reasoned fleet
plan we have developed for the '90s and beyond,'' said Continental
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hollis L. Harris.
   The order will be largely financed by the Boeing Co. and the
engine manufacturer, Continental said in a prepared statement.
   Continental said it had not yet chosen between Rolls-Royce or
Pratt &amp; Whitney to make the engines.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Craig
Martin declined to discuss Boeing's financial arrangement with
Continental. ``We never comment on such arrangements with our
customers,'' Martin said.
   Continental also has an order with Seattle-based Boeing for 100
737s, some of those on option, and with the French firm Airbus
Industrie for 40 long-range A330s, some of those also on option.
   With the order announced Monday, Continental has a total of 190
aircraft on order - including 95 on option - to add to its fleet of
338 aircraft.

<HEAD>Philips Working On Digital Tape Machine That Also Plays Regular
Cassettes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch electronics giant Philips
Consumer Electronics confirmed Monday it was developing a new
digital cassette machine that would also play regular analog tapes.
   The company said the system, when used with digital tapes, would
provide the same sound quality as compact discs.
   Tandy Corp. said Monday it was working with Philips on the
technology.
   Tandy said the system's introduction would depend on action from
the U.S. Congress on copyright legislation. Record companies have
been fearful that digital audio tapes' ability to make near-perfect
copies would encourage record piracy.
   To help mollify the record companies, DAT was introduced in the
United States this summer using a technical standard that prohibits
the machines from being used to make second-generation recordings
from CDs.
   Although DAT recorders were first introduced in Japan three
years ago, sales have been slow because of their high cost, the
lack of prerecorded tapes and opposition from record companies.
   Unlike conventional digital audio tape machines, the new machine
would offer consumers the ability to continue playing their old
tapes.
   Sony Corp. last month introduced a new line of DAT machines
including a car player and a Walkman-sized version.
   DAT, like CDs, use use computer-like digital signals to
reproduce sound. However, DAT machines also allow consumers to make
recordings that can rival studio equipment in sound quality.
